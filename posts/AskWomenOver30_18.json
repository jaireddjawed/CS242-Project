        "text": "So I and my partner have been seeing one another for a while. \n\nThings were a bit slow when compared to the western ways of dating as I was dipping toes into the dating pool after passing away of my husband and was completely new to the western ways of dating. For me it has been a steep learning curve from a dating side since I started seeing him (deceased husbands ex boss) as I am from an arranged marriage back ground.\n\nOver time we did get intimate but not as per what is expected in the western world. Post we geting intimate whenever we get the opportunity to spend time alone either after a party or after a date or when kids arent in town, he makes best use of the time by trying his best to see my body in its bare minimum or getting me to show off my body to him more under one pertex or the other.\n\nIs this behvaiour common among couples dating or seeing one another?\n\nI would apprecaite on how best I could go about this without causing too much of a flutter",

        "text": "Hi, amazing women here. I know there is a subreddit, and I have been writing there for years, but now I would love to hear from more women, with different lives, experiences and stories. So. I have had vaginismus all my life. After some bad experiences in my youth. It took me 20 years to find a doctor, after many shitty ones, an amazing human being who cured me in 6 treatments. We were both crying. She told me that in two weeks I can have penetrative sex. She stops more than once during treatments just to hug me and tell how brave I have been. I am moved and I am shocked. Haven t realized yet. I am in a long term relationship, 8 years. Ups and downs. He hasn t been really committed in my healing journey that has been pure hell. But that's not the point. Of course, during these years, we explored other sides of sex together and we did tons of things. Maybe he Is not my forever love, because he doesn t want to work on his stuffs, but otherwise I trust him, I have fun with me and we have been together in a long journey of life. But now. I am so scared. I trust my doctor and I trust my partner. I want to try with him. Can you give me some advice or some support? I would really appreciate It.",

I'm friends with her family and I've been over her house for holidays, her mom was my pinner for nursing school graduation, like, we've been in each other's lives. Last year on my birthday, I had some peeps over, of which she was the one I was closest to and she called like 30 minutes before she was supposed to come over and bailed because she was tired. She and her husband also started this game night and invited like one random group of people but I wasn't one of them, which kind of hurt my feelings. And there was another sort of incident where she kind of excluded me. Now I think they're having a party that I'm not invited to but I think they might have forgotten to invite me but that also hurts my feelings. I feel like i should say something, but also at this age is it drama? How do I do this? And if she just doesn't want to be friends, is this just her way of removing me? I just feel like that's so mean, and I just feel like, at least include me when all our friends are included, we don't have to interact. What should I do?",

        "text": "I'm sorry in advance... I know this is a lot. \n\nI 35f \"met\" my boyfriend 31m on reddit in December of 21' on one of the gone wild sub reddits. Long story short, we hit it off (in person) and have spent only a handful of weekends apart in the last year +. There were some Rocky patches in the beginning with his previous ex of 7ish years and a girl he lied to me about hanging out with at one point before we had set boundaries and decided to be exclusive. We had set another boundary further into our relationship (while in the car together) where we both agreed that we  considered sexting or inappropriate conversations with other people cheating and unacceptable. I asked him if he had sexted other people and he told me no. \n\nOur relationship up until a few weeks ago had been truly wonderful. This was the very first healthy relationship I have ever experienced. We had clear communication, respect, and deep love for eachother. It just felt right. I can't really explain it, but he's my best friend and my favorite person. I could spend every waking hour with him and not be sick of him. I felt safe and secure. I felt like I could trust him with/about everything. It felt like he was my person, my soul mate. \n\nAnd then came the fall. At the end of January I was traveling for work and I was gone for almost 3 days. We spent 5 days before I left together and he came to pick me up when I arrived home. The following day we got into a conversation about his \"dirty reddit\" and I asked to see what was on his home page because I was curious. We have a very adventurous and healthy sex life and are typically interested in what turns eachother on.\n\nHe wasn't very keen on open his reddit. I tried to ignore my intuition that something felt wrong but I couldn't. I asked and he eventually did show me, and that's when I saw that he had unread messages in his chat. When I asked him to open them he tried to avoid it and tell me that something in there was a surprise? But he  eventually did show me and what I saw left me shocked and heartbroken. He had been sexting women the entire time I was gone INCLUDING the day I was omw home. \n\nAt first he tried to play it off as he was looking for someone to watch us, then looking for someone to join us, then he said he was edging for me, then he said he has low self esteem and likes the validation (this may not be entirely accurate). He then went on to tell me that he is addicted to porn and somehow it warped his judgement making him think it was okay and rationalize it. This was after the \"they're just porn stars it meant nothing, all I want is you\" claim. \n\nHe also told me he started doing this again over the summer. The time where we decided to actually be in a relationship and when we first said I love you to each other. I just can't wrap my head around the time line. I did not give consent to invite any other people into our relationship or sex life. And he was sexting girls telling them he wants to do things to/with them that we do together. He lied about the sexting when we spoke about it and set the boundary and then CONTINUED afterward. \n\nSo he lied to me and felt okay enough to continue to keep things from me and continue the behavior. If I had not found out he would still be doing it. \n\nMore than three weeks later and I'm still reeling. I feel like I can't trust him. I'm having difficulty managing my emotions and I hate the person I'm being. He has a hard time expressing his feelings and I feel like I'm a terrible person. He's cried and apologized and promised to do whatever he has to to make things right. Can't live without me, brought up living together. Was extremely supportive and drove almost an hour every night to spend with me so I didn't have to be sad alone. \n\nHe also has a friend that he climbs with 3+ times per week for a couple of hours each time. They were friends with benefits before he and I started seeing each other. He had a fresh hickey on his neck from her the first time we met and he stopped sleeping with her not too long after we started seeing each other. I expressed discomfort with this but did not expect him to stop seeing her. I trusted him. Even after he mentioned a few weeks ago that she made some comment or joke about meeting a couple and being their unicorn, which I felt was inappropriate. I did not ask him to stop seeing her. \n\nAfter finding out that he lied to me and disregarded my boundaries, I am completely uncomfortable with their friendship now and I have been very up front about. I did not want to ask him to stop seeing her, even though I eluded to it. It finally came to a head tonight when he said he was meeting her at the gym and i just kinda clammed up. He said I make him feel like I'm mad at him and then just basically ghosted me when she got there saying he didn't want to talk to me about anything. I asked if he stopped talking to me because she got there and at the time his response was just \"I'm climbing\". Rather than telling me she was there which he told me after. It may seem small, but he withholds information like this more often than I'm comfortable with. \n\nI think there's a major disconnect in our relationship when it comes to mutual respect. I'm uncomfortable with this, yet he claims that if I were hanging out with someone multiple times per week that I was fucking when we met he would feel fine. \n\nHe told me that asking him to stop talking to her is fucked up and that I need to trust him. Climbing is his outlet so he doesn't do those other things e.g.: sext other women on reddit. I think that considering he just broke my trust AGAIN, the request to trust him is unreasonable. And then he \"had to think about it\" until I basically told him that I am unwilling to be in a relationship where I do not feel secure and my feelings aren't taken seriously. Then he told me in a frustrated tone that he won't climb with her. I know he's going to resent me. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I'm trying so hard to move forward. I love him so much more than I could ever understand and I don't want to love my life without him. Unfortunately the whole situation has caused me to regress in several areas where I've worked for the last few to reduce trauma responses and think of things rationally. I'm continuing to work toward being as well adjusted as possible. I feel like since this boundary was crossed we're destined for failure and I don't know if I have it in me to move forward. I feel angry, betrayed, and unimportant. \n\nI just don't know what to do... I need help. Please... \n\nA little background because I feel the need to justify my feelings here:\n\nI grew up in a household where my parents were absent and abusive. My father cheated on my mother for a long time and the whole situation was not sensored on account of us kids. \n\nAfter he moved out I was subjected to increased physical and emotional abuse by my mother and sister because I was close with my father. I was also lashing out and removed from my home to attend school in a residential treatment facility from 13-17 years old. After my father left, my mother had a nervous breakdown and was never the same. I was very close with my father until my early 20s when I realized that he had lied to me my entire life. About his work schedule (he was leaving early to see his gf), about the values he instilled in me growing up, about where he was when his family and children needed him most. My mother tried to kill herself when I was 9 years old, I took a pill bottle out of her hands and locked myself in the bathroom to call the police. They came and took my mother away to the psychiatric ward where she was for a week. My sister and I were completely alone, my father never came because he was on vacation with his girlfriend. \n\nAt the end of 2018 I exited a 5.5 year relationship with a malignant narcissist. Who would sext other women and solicit them for photos. He would refuse to have sex with me and lock himself in the bathroom for hours to masturbate, watch porn, and sext other women. To him, I was disgusting, undesirable, crazy, a snake. I would look through his phone and snoop because he was always lying to me.\n\nAbout 4.5 years in we moved to another country and he relentlessly abused me both emotionally and psychologically until I felt so worthless I had a nervous breakdown and attempted to kill myself. I eventually left and over the last 16 months have created safety and stability for myself. Something I never had in my life. \n\n\n\nI was very upfront about my past and the damage it did with my current bf. I've been dedicated to becoming the best version of myself for the last few years and to feel my progress slide back is devastating. I feel like an awful person and a failure. I'm terrified of losing him and terrified of being vulnerable again. \n\ntldr; Boyfriend sexted girls on reddit  while I was traveling for work (and other times) after setting mutual boundary that sexting is cheating and lying about it at the time. Expects me to just trust him after this breach of trust when he hangs out with a previous FWB even though I tell him how deeply it hurts me. Unsure of what to do. Unsure of if I'm being crazy or irrational... Looking for input.",

It’d be different if the questions were about their fathers, boss, friends, etc. But no, it’s all women asking men how to fix their man. Is embarrassing. We have more to bring than just that to a sub that I have always considered very welcoming and full of knowledge. \n\nWe have the occasional man coming here to ask questions. But right now, I went over r/askmenover30 and I cringed over the amount of women posting there about their man as soon as the ban was lifted. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I hope they go back to when their sub didn’t allow relationship topics.",

I feel guilty for this because she loves me, but I can’t help it. \n\nAn example: she gives me unsolicited advice that’s just crazypants and culturally irrelevant, like, “You should start calling your mother-in-law ‘Mom’. She would love it. Trust me, I know because I’m a mom.” Instead of just brushing it off, my mind spirals into so many levels of annoyance. (Your culturally different background inconvenienced me in so many ways growing up, you refuse to admit your cultural background doesn’t apply to all cultures, you’re so overbearing about my relationship with my in-laws, you’ve been so controlling my whole life and this is why I lack self-assuredness in my decisions etc etc). I just get so resentful remembering her failures in how she raised me. I’m not asking for help on this one issue, but just giving an example of how deeply annoyed I get. \n\nOf course, I hide all this because my mom’s just trying to love me in the way she knows how, and someday she’ll die and I’ll miss her. I also wonder, does she also get deeply annoyed by me?\n\nWomen with adult kids, does this deeply complex annoyance go both ways while traveling with your adult kids, or is it a one-way thing?",

Im in the middle of a career change but lucky enough to not be too financially stressed. So basically my life is good. Nothing I can complain about. \n\nI just feel like it is devoid of meaning and purpose. I used to derive a lot of that feeling from my work in a “helping” field but Ive burnt out and am transitioning to a role with less stress and less emotional drain, but also less fulfilling. \n\nI also used to feel deeply connected to the earth and nature in general and would consider myself to be a spiritual person. But now I don’t feel that deep connection anymore. I still derive much pleasure from being in nature but I no longer feel that spiritual side that I used to. \n\nI have goals and things to work towards in my life, but none of it seems deeply meaningful. It’s just an existence.\n\nIronically I used to wish to be in a position where I could just exist happily with low stress and not worry myself about the world. But now that I have that opportunity, I feel … like I’m missing something. \n\nI’ve thought that maybe volunteering might help but I’m really not sure. \n\nWhat is it in your life that gives you meaning and purpose or is that not something you really care about?",

I went on alone trips a lot, go to my favorite restaurants by myself, always having great conversations with strangers I met during whatever I do alone. I also made some great friends this way.\n\nThe reason I decided to come out of the woodwork and start dating again is because, one day I realized I turned into a woman that has her life together financially/emotionally. Strong and independent, probably a bit too strong that I don't bring out my feminine side enough. \n\nI don't need a man but think it would be fun to have one, for the sake of enjoying life and simple pleasures together. That's why I started online dating. I was applying my 29 yrs old(before solo) requirements to look for men. But then in the convos, and dates, I found out I am not willing to tolerate a lot of behaviors and reluctant to make time/invest efforts for guys. It takes very little for me to walk away. There seems to be a cost - benefits formula in my head, that I would think for the time and efforts I put in this guy, perhaps I get better returns on my career and other side gigs. I already don't have enough time to take care of everything I am working on in my full time job and side hustles. I see a great future in those things and find it hard to make concessions. \n\nAt some point, I need someone that I want to go home to and feel safe around. Logically I understand that I need to put in the efforts... but that just counters to what I am feel like doing at the moment. \n\nAnybody has done it and been there before?

He wound up pulling out a ring and saying that he knew he wanted to marry me almost immediately and was just waiting to ask me. I said yes and we announced our pregnancy and engagement. \n\nBasically the entire pregnancy was extremely rocky, at one point he encouraged me to get an abortion. There were good times but we fought a lot and he wound up financially supporting me because I lost my job. Now our son is 7 months old. Things have calmed down a lot but it’s not perfect. We still get in arguments over little things frequently. It’s becoming obvious to me that our personalities don’t mesh well. He struggles with mental illness and I honestly don’t feel like I’m up to dealing with it. I’ve come to realize he is an alcoholic and while he is not drinking now, I don’t believe he has done the work or gotten the support to maintain sobriety. His moods feel like a constant source of stress.\n\nUltimately I want a stable happy life with my child. I don’t even know what I would do if we broke up because I don’t make enough money to support myself. He has said he would not want custody but I also suspect he would dodge child support because he has his own business and under reports his taxes(another value issue and a huge concern if we were to get married. ) but it feels crazy to throw out an OK relationship and the stability that comes with for the uncertainty of single motherhood and the pain that might cause our child but I’m not excited at the thought of marrying him. I just feel like I’m in way over my head. Any words of encouragement are appreciated.",

He doesn’t find any joy in kids that we know, he says he thinks he’ll hate it and feels dread at the thought of telling me because he knows I want them. He used to say he wanted them, but he thought he’d feel differently at this age. He said he could see himself wanting one at a much older age, 10+ years in the future.\n\nI’m not angry at him for his feelings but obviously feeling a lot of shock, disappointment and fear over our futures.\nI’ve started to wonder why I want kids myself or if I just assumed I wanted them. But at the end of the day I think about my life and I do think I want kids.\n\nNow we are going to go to therapy. But wondering if anyone who is my age has gone through the same thing, with a partner who has changed their mind (but doesn’t seem quite 100% about it). It’s very scary having to decide between the person you thought was your life partner and a future that might not even happen. My partner suffers from anxiety and I’m worried that has caused him to fixate on how terrible having a baby would be, so hoping therapy will help clarify his own thoughts. I don’t think I can wait around if he won’t know for years if he wants them or not though.",

I’ll preface by saying they’re perfectly lovely people and I know others deal with way crazier in-laws all the time. \n\nMy annoyance though is that my MIL and I are fundamentally very different people. She’s clearly a huge extrovert and is so excited when we come she follows our car’s progress on find my friends and stands out in the street to wave us in when we arrive then runs to the car to say hello over and over again. Its…. A lot. Her enthusiasm is sweet but honestly overwhelming and kind of infantilizing. Not to mention this is very much the opposite of my relationship with my parents who are very unemotional and already transitioned to a more I take care of them relationship. \n\nIn her enthusiastic nature, my MIL wants to do everything together. I’m an introvert and need solo activities to avoid stress and feel like a human. I usually plan accordingly to make this work without burdening others, but lately my MIL has been inviting herself to my solo activities. For example I planned to go on this interesting hike on vacation to Tahoe. she invited herself as I was walking out the door. She didn’t have the right shoes and there was a lot of snow on the ground. We made it like a tenth of a mile then gave up. \n\nThis visit I planned to check out some vintage furniture stores on Sunday morning. I made the mistake of mentioning this to my husband when she was in earshot and she immediately says “I’ll accompany you.” I told her that’s kind but I usually like to go thrifting by myself because I know I take a long time. She says it’s fine and that she’ll go. Guys. She doesn’t enjoy vintage anything. She’s going to complain that everything is so old, why would I want that and let’s just go to Ashley furniture. She’s going to make me feel bad about an activity I love and on top of that this was supposed to be my me time. So I just lied and said I found out the store was closed on sundays. \n\nI feel trapped when I visit. I can’t take a walk alone, I can’t go to the store. Pretty much all I can do is take a nap, but last time I faked a long nap she thought I was sick and burst in with six different kinds of medication. \n\nI really do appreciate that’s she’s trying to spend time with me, but it’s kind of making me resent her. My husband is a total team player and offers to distract her, make other plans with her, but she gets upset if I don’t join them. And we both agree that there’s pretty much nothing we can say that she won’t be offended by. \n\nWe’re all going on a two week vacation to her home country next month and I’m dreading it. Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do I stay sane without us hurting her feelings?",

I’ve been friends with this girl for over 10 years but ever since she had her baby 3 years ago, there’s been a complete shift in our friendship and understandably so since she’s a mother now. During the first 2 years, I noticed that we were seeing each other as much which I understood because she was a new mother and the pandemic was going on. I figured things would change as the restrictions started being lifted but it seems that we see each other even less now. \n\nAs I sit back and think about the last year of our friendship, I was the main one initiating meet ups. We met up maybe a handful of times, sometimes she was nearly 2 hours late (which she didn’t inform me about until I told her that I was about to leave my house) and other times she would forget about it until the last minute and say that she can’t come. The last time I initiated a meet up was maybe 2 months ago, I told her that we should meet up on Friday and whenever Friday came around, she never reached out to me and I didn’t reach out either. It’s gotten to the point where, if we make plans to meet up, I will call myself reaching out to her the day before to make sure we’re still on for xyz because I always assume she’ll forget. I’ve tried to be understanding because she’s always been kinda forgetful but I am sure if she made plans to meet up with a guy, she definitely wouldn’t forget. \n\nThere have been many times in the past where she’s been inconsiderate but I’ve given her grace because “that’s how she is”. For example, I volunteered to help her move out of her apartment a few years ago. I told her I’d be there once I got off from work and whenever I arrived, she wasn’t there. Turns out her and her other friend were picking up the Uhaul (which was 30 mins away) and she forgot that I told her I would be there at said time. I waited on her to get back for nearly 45 mins and whenever we got inside her apartment, absolutely nothing was moved. She knew she was moving out 2 months in advance and she was off work for 3 months at the time. I was absolutely livid on the inside.\n\nAfter that last situation, I made a promise to myself to NEVER initiate hanging out with her again and guess what.. she hasn’t initiated either.\n\nShe reached out to me a few earlier and asked if I could do her hair today, being a people pleaser, I started to say that I could do it but I eventually told her that I wouldn’t be free until Thursday. In the past, I probably would’ve gladly done her hair but seeing as how she hasn’t tried to meet up with me for months and all of a sudden she wants to meet up so that I can do her hair? Um no.\n\nI guess my dilemma here is that it’s not like I never hear from this friend. We text several times throughout the week and she calls me every few weeks just to talk.. it’s just the fact that I am always the one that has to plan meet ups between the both of us. And it’s not like she’s a homebody/introvert because she hangs out with her other friends often. \n\nAm I being to sensitive in this situation?\n\nTL/DR: Best friend doesn’t initiate hangouts anymore but doesn’t mind asking for favors.",

        "text": "I've been reevaluating my friendships, and one thing that pops up in this sub often is being someone's free therapist vs being someone's friend.\n\nI recently told a friend that I could no longer listen to her marital problems as I'm just a broken record, and that I'm not her therapist, she should seek professional help and please don't vent to me anymore about her husband (who I really dislike, based on the stories she's told me). I've felt for a long time that I was being a good friend by listening to her problems, but they're always the SAME problems, and she has a generally negative outlook on life. It's difficult to get her to a place where we talk about things she actually likes doing versus what she hates about her life and the world. It got exhausting and I was dreading hearing from her so I set those boundaries.\n\nI'm trying to be a good friend, but also trying to put out the same energy that's given in. The question I'm struggling with is how does one be a good friend and listen, be impartial, show you care, without moving into that therapist role? How does one \"be there\" for a struggling friend while setting boundaries?",

Both my fiance and I are in our 30's and I found this massively inappropriate.\n\n3) did not listen to my only request when taking my engagement photos, which was to remove her sunglasses for photos \n\n4) wanted to gift us a trip on the other side of the world for 3 weeks. It was an incredibly kind offer but neither of us can take 3 consecutive weeks off of work, we had other weddings/vacations we needed to use precious, limited PTO for and we just simply could not make that work. I explained this very clearly. She still called my fiance's cousin \\*multiple times\\* to \"try to convince\" us to go on this trip. I would have loved to go, but unfortunately, we just could not with work. What upset me was I had very clearly explained why we could not, yet she was still convinced we could be talked into it via his cousin. \n\nI'm a very \"nip it in the bud\" type of person. So when things come up in my work or personal relationships that need to be addressed, I like to hash it out right away. However, I've been a big believer in everyone should handle their own families. In other words, my fiance should have been the one to address any and all issues with his parents and vice versa with mine. \n\nI'm just wondering what all you wonderful ladies do with the handling of your in laws. Because I'm reaching a breaking point and growing resentful. My fiance and I had a long talk the other day and asked me to list off everything that has been upsetting me with my FMIL. Now he insists on speaking to her about it but I'm worried I now look like an AH with a laundry list of complaints that have been festering over the last few months. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I have about a 25k in my roth ira (I max it out each year) and 12k in my high yield savings account. I also usually keep a few thousand in my checking account (probably more than is recommended, I know). I  make about 56k from my 9-5 + freelance income That comes out to a few thousands each year.\n\nI have dreams of building a lil decent nest egg for retirement and eventually living off of my investments, but I can't get rid of my itch to build a little cottage in a rural area. And I mean *little.* I only want enough space to live, have an office, and store my Christmas decorations. I don't see a lot of houses fitting this criteria unless they're more or less about to fall over (would be 110% down to buy a fixer upper 1920s home if I were handier), so I'm thinking building may be my best option. I know that's a big undertaking though and I'm aware That my resources are pretty thin. I have handy family members who could help with some of the technical parts, but I'm still worried this might be too much at this phase of life. But to be honest, I'm slowly wasting away living in the city. I'm not interested in nightlife at all and all I want is quiet. I grew up in an unincorporated area, so I'm fully prepared for the isolation.\n\nI believe I'm eligible for a USDA direct home loan under their low income range but I have read they are rarely given by lenders. I have found land I could reasonably afford and it would be eligible under USDA's programs. At this point just hearing some anecdotal experiences would help me decide if I should wait a few years to pursue this. \n\nHas anyone done something similar on their own? What do you wish you had known? 2) Am I biting off way more than I can chew?",

        "text": "I'm a mid-level manager (F, late 30s) with a couple of employees working beneath me. This is my first management position, and I'm starting to run into a couple of big issues.\n\nApparently, the person who held the position before I did wasn't doing much. She foisted a lot of work off onto her staff and just bopped around all day. When I took over, I cleared years' worth of work backlog in a couple of weeks. I also do the vast majority of my own work without telling my staff to do it. Our department is cleaner than it's been in years, running more efficiently than it has in years, and I'm very proud of the work we've all put in to accomplish it. I thought I was doing the right thing, but this is apparently a problem.\n\nA member of the staff is concerned that she won't have enough work to do if I'm doing so much. She hasn't told me this directly, but a couple of coworkers have mentioned it to me in a roundabout way, but I failed to pick up on it. Admittedly, I'm on the autism spectrum; I miss a lot of things if they aren't said to me directly. My old manager, who's known me the longest of anyone here and knows how to talk to me, straight up told me what the problem was and why. So I'm facing two main dilemmas:\n\n1) I haven't told anyone I'm autistic besides that one manager 9 years ago. I do a lot of masking at work, which is tough and exhausting, but I also have no intention of telling anyone else here that I'm autistic. I do my work just fine; subtle social cues, however, escape me. I'm almost 40. I'm not sure I'll ever get it right, and despite me trying my best, I'm not sure this is a problem that can be solved.\n\n2) What can I do to reassure my staff member? I'm not trying to put her out of a job. I just want this department to run smoothly and for everyone to feel valued. I can...do less work? I honestly have no idea. We'll definitely need to have a talk, though. Maybe she'll just tell me?\n\nShe's out for the week, so I'll have time to think about this. Hopefully, some of y'all can help point me in the right direction. What do you think needs to happen?  \n\n\nThanks, everyone.",

She has since sent me bday cards underline that she is my sister however has yet to acknowledge what happened … this isn’t the first rodeo of this type of behaviour as three years prior to my wedding she disappeared and came back out of no where pregnant with a man 20+ years older that we didn’t know. We moved on from that and my nephew (her son) is incredible. However, she is completely unreasonable my mom has tried to set up a day for us at her house to talk things out in a relaxed environment and continues to play the victim and acts like everyone else is the problem refusing to hear any other side…. My struggle is I do want a relationship with my nephew but it comes at the cost of my own mental health. \n\nI don’t know whether to give a gift and act like nothing happened to move on as she would probably hope for or what to do … I don’t want an inauthentic relationship that I have to walk on eggshells for. \n\nAny thoughts or advice on this from you all is appreciated.",

One twin becomes just like her father and the other is very insecure and in a relationship with an inept man. They both meet their father as adult women and it is clear both women are seeking the validation of some man. \n\nWhile the show may not be super feminist, I can see my life in it. Historically I have been the latter “twin.” Then I began to wonder about what women who have good relationships with their father are like. I also wanted to know if other women who have negative relationships with their fathers for low similar patters to me or the twins. Specifically, what are their relationships with other men like. Hence the etiology of the question. \n\nAdditionally, hopefully, some of the answers can help me shape my future relationship with men. At present I am not dating, and I am working on a fulfilling relationship with myself.\n\nThanks for answers. \n\nTL;DR: As someone with an insecure attachment to my father that manifested in my relationships with other men, I am curious to know if other women with insecure attachments have a similar experience and the experiences of women with secure attachments.",

I have a higher libido than he does but I think overall the amount of sex we have is good and there’s not a huge disparity there. \n\nMy issue, (and I want to be clear that this is my issue, not something he has done) is that I have a hard time separating my self esteem and feeling attractive from this.  That mean little voice in the back of my head makes me feel gross and ugly when he (nicely) just wants to cuddle, and when he doesn’t initiate, I feel like I’m undesirable or something. \n\nI want to talk to him about this but I don’t want to approach it from the “you don’t initiate sex and I feel ugly” because the last thing I want to do is to make it seem like he’s done something wrong when he hasn’t.  I also don’t want to make him feel like he has to agree to sex to make me feel better or something. \n\nWhat I want, I guess, is commiseration, advice for how to talk to him, and suggestions for getting over my hang up about this. \n\nThanks!",

Last week my current company announced layoffs and handled them poorly, and, while I’m still employed, I feel like this has just thrown me over the edge. Like in the old movie “Network,” I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take this any more.\n\nOver the holidays I had been building a plan to move into a different industry. I’d really like to take a 3-6 month break between my job and the next. I’ve never taken more than a week between jobs, just taken my bitterness onward. But with things as they are economically now, I don’t have anyone to fall back on, and given a job in a new industry is like 10x harder to land, I’m starting to doubt I should really take a break. I also don’t know if my bitterness is 100% caused by the job I have now, or just capitalism in general. And if that’s the case, not sure a break would help at all. I talk to a therapist, but it’s not helping terribly (I’m on a waitlist for others, but those are still at least 9 months out).\n\nAnyways, just feeling bitter, burnt out, tired, a bit helpless. I really think I need the time off, but it looks further and further from reach.",

I have been told that I am cute (I have a thin, short figure with a young-looking face) but I feel that I am not very approachable or attractive to men when it comes to dating. I am also bad at dressing up elegantly/ fashionably. Most of the men I have been with just wanted me for sex. I also have low self-esteem which I am working on. I know the place I am in is not an ideal dating market for a brown-skinned South Asian woman but I think there is room for improvement in how I present myself and communicate with people. \n\nI started dating in my 30s because most of my life I was religious and conservative with unrealistic expectations.  I was open to having an arranged marriage but now I don't want it because after starting to live alone abroad I left my religion (being anything but Muslim does not make me desirable in the arranged marriage market and I am also uncomfortable with the patriarchal social pressure that comes with arranged marriage).  I have been seeing a Japanese guy for a year now, but I don't know where this is going. It started as a Tinder hookup and we continued this being exclusive to each other. I have deep feelings for him, but I sometimes wonder if he is good for me. He is not very emotionally expressive and he doesn't want to give me any promise or assurance about the possibility of marriage. Sometimes I feel that I am giving too much in this relationship. Sometimes I have very negative (and toxic) thoughts like this might be the last chance for love and marriage for me because I am getting old and losing my fertility. I couldn't find a guy when I was at the peak of my youth and now with age, I am losing value.  I feel that I am bad at understanding and expressing what I want. I want to learn more about dating, how to communicate with men, and understand the dynamics of romantic relationships.",

We used to be neighbors and would often attend each other's kids birthday parties, exchange babysitting duties to help each other out, just hang out, etc. I would say I considered both he and his wife my friend (and my husband considered them both friends as well). Our kids got along well. \n\nFast forward a couple years, and we don't live near each other any more, but I have maintained a close friendship with  Jake. We just happened to bond over shared interests and both happened to be online a lot. There is nothing inappropriate ever exchanged between us. \n\nI still consider his wife a friend, or at least, I don't have any issues with her. But I have noticed over the years that she has grown quite cold towards me. She is also online on the same platforms I use and actually reached micro-influencer status within a certain niche. She views almost every single one of my posts, but never interacts, not even if it's regarding my family who I thought she cared about to some degree. She will never \"like\" a post ( I see her liking other people's posts) never send me messages of any kind. Every so often I reach out to her or send her a meme or post that I think she would be interested in. I have even replied to some of her posts with positive messages. This last time, she didn't even bother replying to my message and just left it on \"read\". \n\nNow, I wouldn't think too much into this if she was just the type of person to not really want to spend too much time on social media etc. But like I said, she has a bit of a following, and has even commented that she hates it when people view all her posts but never interact (which is what she does to me!). She is also the type of person to cut off people she \"gets bad vibes\" from at the drop of a hat (she has said this herself). I have wondered sometimes if its nothing personal, but she just doesn't think I'm relevant enough to reply to since I'm not an influencer...but then why would she pay attention to all my posts?? Maybe she just feels like we can't relate at all..but I don't think that's the case.\n\nSo, I don't want to overthink it, and I'm definitely not going to bring this up with my friend. I know it probably comes off as rather juvenile and petty. I'm just wondering what you would make of this situation.",

        "text": "Hi all. So, I'll cut to the chase. I'm a thirty-something man living in the UK and I'm a failure. Before any eyes start to roll, this isn't meant as a 'woe-is-me' post. Rather, I'm just at a bit of a loose end, so I'm posting this, I guess, to canvas opinions which might help me decide what to do about everything.\n\nNow, the obvious question is: why am I posting this on a /askwomenover30? Well, two reasons. The first and most important is that it's directly related to my relationship with my partner who is, as you might have guessed, a woman over 30. The second is that 'AskMen' pages are so full of macho red-pill nonsense that it's hard to get anything close to a measured reply. \n\nOK so, what I mean by 'being a failure' is a few things but mostly that I've messed up my career to such an extent that I've been fired from my two most recent jobs within the first six months. I won't go into all the reasons. But, I think what it boils down to is that I didn't pursue things that I was genuinely interested in and good at after graduating from uni and the path of least resistance landed me doing jobs that I was neither good at nor particularly interested in. Plus, it just so happened that the jobs I ended up doing were incredibly high-stress sales roles for start-ups (which I took, in a large part, because the pay was decent).\n\nTowards the end of my twenties, I began to realise that I'd wasted too much time dicking about and embarked on a law degree - fueled partly by an interest in law, but mostly by the idea that it would lead to the sort of 'successful' career that had so far eluded me. This too, I failed. \n\nI have loads of interests and passions, and if I could do it all again I would have loved to find a job in science, or technology or start my own business. The thing is though, I didn't. And I think I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that it just might be too late for me. Moreover, I think I'm beginning to see that from the sales roles to the law degree, I was constantly driven by a desire to be successful - or what 'success' would look like to an observer. And clearly, it didn't work. \n\nThe irony of it all, I suppose, is that losing jobs and failing degrees is incredibly expensive and I probably would have done better if I'd just worked my way up in a supermarket or something. I've got virtually no savings and a lot of debt. It's also had a horrible effect on my mental health.\n\nSo how does this all relate to my partner? Well, she's not a failure. She's very successful (and highly paid) in her career, she has a lot of savings and her own property (that we live in together). I don't in any way feel threatened or emasculated or anything like that. I am incredibly proud of her. Nor, I should say, do I blame her at all for the predicament I've landed myself in. **But**, there's no escaping that my life is intrinsically linked to hers and nowhere more than when it comes to starting a family. We both want a family and we want it to be with each other. In fact, a large part of why I feel that it's too late for me to embark on a career I'm passionate about is that starting a family is more important to me than a career and the uncertainty - and inevitably low entry-level pay - just wouldn't be worth the risk.\n\nNow, I know that I'm smart enough to be successful and I'm good at picking up skills. This isn't meant to be a brag (it's more an indictment of my misspent twenties given how things have turned out) but I did well in school, I've taught myself how to do everything from writing code to plastering walls, and I've got good commercial sense. With enough time or the right lucky break, I'm sure that I could be earning six figures but I just can't say with any certainty how long this would take. So, my thinking is that I could probably find some humdrum, but relatively OK-paid job that would give me a steady source of income - in retail, or admin or something. This wouldn't be a world in which I would ever be the 'main breadwinner' or that I would be doing a job I love, but I could provide some certainty. \n\nThe issue though is that my partner (to her massive credit, I should say) 'believes in me'. She feels that I could succeed in doing something I love. She asks me what I *want* to do and sends me job ads for entry-level positions in fields I'm interested in. She says that she wants me to be happy and find something I enjoy. I love her for this and I'm not trying to second-guess her motives too much. At the same time, however, I worry that if I put my ambitions aside and choose to do something boring but stable that this would be really unattractive or worse, that I'd be letting *her* down. I know that she wants to be able to take time off after having children and, of course, starting a family in general doesn't come cheap. \n\nTo me, 'success' or society's version of it at least, is a lot less important than being a good partner and having a happy family.\n\nHence, that's the crux of the question - how important is it for a man to be successful? Do I throw everything at one last attempt at a successful career or go for the low-risk alternative? I know there won't be any one-size-fits-all answer and it will depend on individual, cultural, and societal factors etc. I'm also aware there are plenty of shades of grey in between. I guess I just don't want to let her down and risk losing the best thing that's ever happened to me by not pursuing 'success'. \n\nTL;Dr I'm an unsuccessful man with a successful partner at a crossroads.",

        "text": "To give more context, I had been seeing this guy “casually” the last few months. Initially our sexual chemistry was amazing. However, I noticed it waned a little within the last few weeks. We’ve become very close emotionally and it’s clear it was no longer something casual. \nA few weeks back I had brought up to him that if he’s open to it, could we try some more aggressive moves during sex (like hair pulling / light choking) and he seemed onboard with it. I didn’t really put two and two together but after that chat, we didn’t have sex as much. To be fair, it’s not like I expected sex every time we hung out. \n\nI just ended things today for various reasons (he has commitment issues) and I’m pretty bummed. But I’m also thrown off bc during our conversation, he brought up that he’s having trouble connecting with me sexually as of recently, and when I asked why, he didn’t have an answer for me. It was really stressful and triggering for me (past sexual abuse) and I told him I don’t know how I’m supposed to help the situation if he doesn’t know why. He kinda said he thought it had to do with him feeling more emotional towards me, but he also couldn’t say if that was the reason for sure. \n\nEven though we’re done, it’s still really bugging me. Have any of you ladies run into your guy losing sexual interest, even if temporary? He said he wasn’t super worried about it and thought it could get better, but I guess I’ll never find that out. \n\nThanks all",

        "text": "As the title says. I was the youngest of 3 growing up. I had a sheltered upbringing and treated like the baby of the family. \n\nI have done stuff with my life: university, research on my own abroad, multiple different jobs. I'm now a project manager. \n\nDespite that I feel very emotionally immature. I have been in a relationship for 12 years with a man who was emotionally pretty abusive, controlling but I was also codependent. I've not had to deal with bills or running my own life for a decade. \n\nMy Mum died in November 2021 and it's hit me badly. I have no support network and only now do I feel an impending doom about death and how I'm wasting my life. I can suddenly see how incredibly immature I am and also how my Mum enabled that quite a lot. I feel scared and lost like a little girl. \n\nI feel I can't cope without her, or without my partner. I want to be stronger but it feels impossible. Now that I'm 37 and unlikely to have a family of my own it feels even more pointless. I feel deeply, deeply ashamed of who i am. \n\nI'm not taking care of myself at all and I lack a reason to. \n\nI guess i would like to know if I'm alone in this feeling.",

We had plans of travelling, so I was thinking instead of just sitting at home and trying to distract myself, I will go on a short trip for this President's weekend. I will just get an Airbnb or check into a hotel or something , I will still be miserable but it might be better.\n\nI am thinking of ways to really handle this situation. Also it would have been my first valentine's day had we stayed together, that kinda sucked as well. I bet we might have taken a trip or done something, so I kinda want to go ahead and do it anyway.\n\nI live in the Bay area, are there any other things I could possibly do?",
