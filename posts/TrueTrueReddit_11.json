Or give money to the people, [as economist urge in free United Kingdom](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/03/cash-handouts-are-best-way-to-boost-growth-say-economists) these days.  \n\nCreative commons can burn money as well as financial systems do.  \n\nEither that, or install some stock market bots and educational AI' into people's homes so that they can share the loot or even go to movies, instead of picking garbage as they're forced in some parts of globalized and devalued Europe. Perhaps US too, doono… things are fuzzy over there and Snowden knows you folks are firewalled on large scale fora since WTC 7.\n\nArrr!\n\nEither way, I'm fed up with infringement(s) of freedom from want and rights to privacy. I'll advocate both, open and private internet, where people can share their stuff at will, same as it ever was. European Commission, supranational as it is, could deploy this in name of its constitutes even if they're yet unaware. I'd suggest we do the same with conjured money.\n\nWould love to read some thoughts on issues of piracy, blocking, infringement, freedom...",
