I've also found out I'm not super fascinated by engineering.  \n\nIn contrast, I think math is really interesting, and if I switch to it next year it would only take me 1.5 years to graduate.  I've heard bachelor math degrees are not super sought after by employers though and my GPA is hovering around 2.9 which may not be good enough to get into grad school.

However, because I’m a math student, I’m more inclined to books or course resources that provide rigorous math foundations as well as actual implementations.\n\nI have done some research here and ML subs, the often recommended books seem to be “Intro to Statistical Learnings”, “Probabilistic Machine Learning” by Murphy, “Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit ……”, and there is also “Understanding Machine Learning”, as well as Stanford 231n. So I feel some what hard to choose and do not know what might be a starting point: Probabilistic, statistical, Bayesian inference, and so on...\n\nSo I was wondering that for math people who have actually studied or worked on ML and DL, what’s your favorite book/course that provide good math foundations as well as implementation examples?\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Hi guys! I'm at my last year as an undergraduate (Europe) in Economics Science. In about two months I will start writing my thesis and I want to explore more Mathematical aspects of economics (I have a great passion for Mathematics, so going back I think I would enroll in maths). So far I have done a lot of Statistics, Calculus (function analysis, gradient and differential equations) and next semester I will probably take Algebra.\nI was thinking on doing the thesis on Game Theory, and wanted some suggestions on what should I study to be more \"Mathematical proficient\" on the topic. I read that Game Theory is directly linked with Graph Theory (as in writing game in normal mode) and read that Graph Theory is a subgroup of discrete math, but have no idea what I need to study discrete math.\nIf you have any suggestions I will gladly take it, also if you suggest other branch to study or other part that I could take a deeper look into it!",

I'm not confident in my solutions and I want your take on the strong induction proof in the first part of the question. I'm not looking for answers, just some advice or hints.\n\n[The homework problem](https://preview.redd.it/j5mxfik10uia1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=794534620e8b9643d89ea29aa66841c72e8d89b1)\n\nAs for the rest, I wrote my recurrence relation as T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n, and I still haven't completed the master theorem section since I'm still unsure of the recurrence relation solution. My reasoning is the algorithm divides into two subproblems, each dividing by 2 as the recursive tree goes. Feel free to disagree, just please be nice, I'm still new to proofs.\n\nAny response would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "In my current university math course, the teacher uses online exams that cengage creates.  On our last exam, there was a simple problem going over interval notation.  It asked to identify and plot the interval notation.  I plotted the interval notation on the line graph correctly, but I thought it was asking for the key values to the written part, so that’s what I provided. \n\nThe professor has us hand in our scratch paper at the end and mentions if we accidentally typed something in WebAssign incorrectly, but calculated the problem correctly on our scratch paper, we can get those points back.  \n\nOn my scratch paper, I wrote down the steps up to the point where I found the test intervals that worked, afterwards I calculated the inclusive values mentally since this process is simple, and then graphed the line.  \n\nI got the graph correct, but I obviously got the other answer incorrect which didn’t want the key values, it wanted the interval notation to be written out + plotted.  \n\nI was told I wouldn’t receive this point back because my interval notation was calculated incorrectly on my scratch paper.  This is impossible as I got the graph correct on the same problem.  \n\nThis point would have pushed me over to an A, but the professor won’t budge.  I feel like that point should be given back because it would be impossible for me to get the interval line graph correct, without calculating the interval notation.  \n\nI asked my professor to bring my scratch paper to class Monday so I can confirm that I pulled the interval notation out of thin air lol.  Wish me luck 😅",
