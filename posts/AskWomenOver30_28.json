        "text": "Hi everyone, saying this sub has been helpful to me would be an understatement and before today, I was a mere spectator. \n\nI am asking for advice on how to have 'the talk' with a guy that we are not a great fit. \n\nI am 28F and I am a confident woman for the world, but deep down, I have always struggled with major self-esteem issues. I have been in active therapy for the past two years and it's helped me tremendously in my career but my issues with my relationship are a fairly recent addition to my therapy sessions. For as long as I can remember, I have chased men who offer the bare minimum, are kind of misogynistic, and often put me down through their words or actions and keep me guessing about the intensity of their romantic interest in me. I did have a somewhat healthy relationship of three years but ever since that ended, I am realizing I hardly ever ask for things in a relationship and consider myself lucky if a guy does enough. Ever since my breakup, I have had multiple talking stages where I feel I have been either ghosted or faded out by the men I was interested in. \n\nAnyway, cut to today. I have been talking to a guy for two months who is a walking carnival of red flags. This guy is openly misogynistic, barely asks me questions about myself, talks about himself all the time, has not shown me any considerable affection, and thinks him roasting others is 'funny'. The only catch here is that this guy calls me a lot to talk, is pretty responsive on calls, and we have somewhat decent conversations. I know if I continue talking to him, I am going to get more attached and repeat the same cycles that I am trying to let go of. Due to my self-esteem issues, I am hardly able to reject a guy I am first interested in. It's always a game of 'I'll date him if he wants it'. \n\nI am asking for advice on how to go beyond the recognition of these problems, and finally for the first in my life have the talk where I cut a guy off first or navigate our awkward situationship. How do I make the conversation more about how I don't want to continue because I am not getting the things I want from a partner instead of having a pity party for myself and asking him if he likes me enough or wants to date me?",

I didn’t talk about it to many people but two girlfriends of mine, and now this. It makes me feel really really sick to my core, i don’t want to confront because the person who told me asked me to promise I won’t, and second because I don’t want to, i don’t want to prove to someone my traumas and issues. It makes me feel really bad that they are out their telling my vulnerabilities and sad things to people and labelling it as lies. I should’ve known better before telling them anything, they were always vile about other people’s things but since i have known them most my life, and i was vulnerable i did.

        "text": "As a surprise my MIL told us last week that she'd booked a flight to see us, and that she'd be staying with us in our apartment for 6 weeks. My partner and I (early 30s) live abroad and haven't seen her since before covid so we were both thrilled that she'd be visiting.\n\nHosting her would be no problem if we had a spare room, but we live in a studio apartment, no bedrooms. We're in a HCOL area and saving for a house.\n\nMy biggest fear is that this will somehow damage my (currently good) relationship with my MIL or partner. I'm very introverted and like my alone time, while she's highly extroverted. I'm also a little rigid, while she's more of a free spirit and does and plans things without asking. I'm also incredibly germaphobic and she's the type I could see using the same rags to clean the floors and counters.\n\nHer and my partner have a very similar personality so he tends to understand her POV more easily. I've gotten the feeling before that she and my partner think I'm a grinch when I don't want to go along with their plans or wishes. My partner and I are already arguing over some of my concerns, he says I'm already being too negative.\n\nThe idea of having to be \"socially on\" when I come home after a hard day at work for 6 consecutive weeks is just really stressing me out. I can't even retreat to my own room, as our entire apartment is a shared space. I also work from home 3 days a week but I'm not sure I can do that during her visit due to the limited space.\n\nI really want this visit and their reunion to go well, does anyone have any tips on how to prepare myself mentally, what discussions to have before she comes?\n\nWhich boundaries to set versus when to just let things go? Strategies for calming myself down if things get to be too much?\n\nI don't want to do or say anything that I'll regret for decades all over a fleeting disagreement. It's easy to bite your tongue over something unimportant when you're spending a day or two with someone, I feel like it'd be harder over several weeks, particularly as I'm not a very social person in the first place.",

        "text": "A little backstory: I work full time and attend grad school in the evenings. I've been in this role for a little over two months (but in the same company for 4+ years) knowing full well I was going into this new dept to get it organized.  Problem is,  it's only a two person team and my new manager is the one who keeps dropping the ball.  Today,  for example,  we had a meeting with an event organizer who expected us to have A + B secured,  since he emailed my manager about it 3 weeks ago. Thing is,  my manager didn't read through their email and missed the request completely, causing me to put down my work and do outreach for the event THIS SATURDAY.  He, meanwhile, did nothing but forward the old email over to me for context. \n\nWhile he acknowledged that it was his fault and that he needed to \"do better,\" I find that I keep pushing myself to do more simply to make up for what he can't do. Today,  I asked him what his thoughts are about expanding the team,  and he said we weren't there yet because we're successfully working at high-capacity and he hates spending (company) money. \n\nTldr: new manager is incompetent and I made the mistake of working hard right off the bat to make up for his inadequacies + impress the higher-ups. With that and grad school,  I'm burning out.\n\nSo my question is, is there a way for me to slow down without making it obvious? The more I do, the more work we get and the worse his performance gets, so I end up doing even more.  \n\nAlso, he's trying to apply for a dept director position and I'm trying to get his job once he leaves. So I still hope to come out of all this smelling like roses.",

She didn't know if he was in a relationship or not, as they've been no contact. He replied by telling her that his relationship with her was the best one he's ever been in, but that he's committed to the woman he's with now (me).\n\nI'm feeling pretty devastated right now. Sure, he told her he's not interested and committed to me, but by saying that his relationship with her was the best one he's been in, that means that he doesn't consider ours the best. I'm shocked and it really hurt to read that. He's definitely the best relationship of my life, and I don't think I'd commit to someone who wasn't.\n\nI don't get why he even felt the need to tell her that. Either don't reply, or just say you're not interested and happily engaged. He didn't even tell her that he's engaged.\n\nThis feels like a deal breaker for me. I feel like I'll feel always feel second best now, even though he treats me so well and I feel like he loves me. Am I overreacting? I haven't talked to him about this yet.",

I picked a product that wound up being twice as expensive ($70) as I thought because it came in two sizes and they were sold out of the smaller size.

We chatted at the counter and she gave me some tiny sample products to try and bagged up my purchase.\n\nI get home and she accidentally gave me the $70 product AND the $30 product. I only paid for the $30 product. \n\nI feel like I should go back to return the product tomorrow. This store is out of my way and it will be a pain in the ass to get there, but I feel like that’s right to do. However, I also worry that the same salesperson won’t be there. Basically I’m a little worried about getting her in trouble by drawing attention to her $70 mistake. Even if she is there I’d be concerned that someone else would overhear me and she’d be in trouble. I have no clue if she realized she did that after the fact, or would even remember me. \n\nAny retail workers here (past and present) want to give me some practical advice? Is my fear reasonable, or should I just return it? (Also slightly worried they’ll flag me as a shoplifter.)\n\nTl;dr: Retail worker put something in my bag I didn’t buy.

The thing is, I hadn't really realized how insecure I was, and specifically around her, until that rejection. \n\nThe guy and I talked about what he liked about FC, and a lot of what he said were the same things I liked about her, and also things I aspired to be—mysterious/private and reserved, spoke and did things with grace, calm under pressure, among other things. I on the other hand am on the more expressive side, mouth can’t keep up with brain, fidget a lot, panic easily. Guy once said I was \"a sunflower in a field of tulips\"—I thought that was a good thing, but it turned out he likes tulips better.\n\nFC lived in the same apartment at that time, and after the rejection I thought, surely she'd be more relaxed at home and not be \"entirely perfect\" (yes, it was that bad). But no, I was around her in the morning and before sleeping at night and her personality/character was the same. That really was how she was.\n\n\"I'm still not enough\" was the thought that broke me that day and honestly my thought life has never been the same ever since. Eventually it wasn't even about the guy anymore. I moved on, fell in love and entered a romantic relationship with someone who likes me for who I am. I even talked to FC about how I felt. It was a suggestion from my boyfriend, an attempt to get the other person’s point of view and humanize them (he said it worked for him). Still, I felt… unhappy with myself. I coped with some unhealthy, self-destructive behaviors which I am still unlearning to this day.\n\nSince then I've become more aware of the inner qualities I admire in the women I know and interact with. So it’s not just FC anymore; unfortunately I’ve accumulated more \"idols\" and have more instances of getting hit by waves of insecurity. And a lot more of these intrusive thoughts. I’ve been working with a professional counselor for about two years to sort out my mental health and this issue specifically, and now I have more good days. However, I’m struggling as these past few my work schedule has made it difficult for me to get an appointment (also, it’s gotten more expensive).\n\nSo really I just want to ask if anyone has advice on letting go of your ideal self and accepting who you are? Even like small everyday practical things. I know my desire to be the cool girl is really ridiculous and is something I should’ve left in high school. But for some reason, especially when I’m about to go to bed and everything is quiet around me, I still can’t shake off the belief that I am the wrong mix of things. I realized during counseling that because of this personality/character trait envy, I’ve been unconsciously holding back from my boyfriend, because I feel like he deserves a better woman. And I don’t want to continue like this anymore. I want to fully allow myself to be loved—heck, I want to stop hating myself 24/7.\n\nAny insight would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",

        "text": "Hello ladies! I'm (34F) slowly recovering from a breakup following a whirlwind relationship with a man (54/F) I met online. He was really lovely and had a lot of the qualities I was looking for in a longterm partner. I was so excited to finally meet someone I could see a future with. But he broke up with me after we'd been together for about 8 months after several weeks of signs he was losing interest and attraction to me which was sad and confusing after he REALLY pushed to make our relationship happen REALLY fast and MUCH faster than I was comfortable with.\n\nA few key factors to know before I dive into my question:\n\n1. He was very high income and well established in his career. I'm established in my career, but in a helping profession that ended up not paying off financially. So there was a huge gap between our incomes &amp; lifestyles. He probably earned my annual take home pay in 1-2 months.\n2. A couple weeks into our relationship, I was exhausted and overwhelmed by the amount of time he wanted to spend together and balancing my full time job and 2 part time jobs to make ends meet. So I ended up quitting a part-time job I really needed so I had some breathing room in my schedule and to accommodate all the time he wanted to spend with me.\n3. Also, I am a woman of color with experience in interracial relationships. He was white with no experience even being on a date with a non-white woman before he met me. His \"normal type\" was blonde hair &amp; blue eyes. I have dark skin, eyes, and hair.\n\nWhen we met, he was so excited by how new and different everything was with me. He seemed to love this new version of himself that included dating a woman of color completely different from anyone he'd dated before.\n\nBut then...\n\n**First he started complaining about my clothes.** He didn't like the styles and colors I wore. He wanted me to wear a color palette that didn't exist in my wardrobe and expensive lingerie. Not just nice, but expensive and high-quality only. With the job I quit to spend time with him, I could not afford it. So I did the best I could with his preferences. For example, I could buy a few pieces of cheaper clothes in the colors he liked, but not the expensive quality. I'd never ASK him to take me shopping, and he also never offered. So my look and style couldn't change significantly.\n\n**Then he seemed to be turned off by my body.** With all the time he wanted to spend with me and needing to text back and forth with me constantly all day every day, I was too exhausted and drained to keep up with the fitness routine I was doing when we met and ended up gaining about 10 lbs. \n\n**Then it was my skin color.** He was turned off by how much darker my skin was turning in the summer sun from the lighter shade of brown I was when we met in the winter (I genuinely do not know if he knew people of color could tan).\n\n**Next he started complaining about my hair.** I had long weave for winter when we met, but when the summer came, I transitioned to shorter braided styles and occasionally wearing my natural hair out to avoid permanent hair loss from long-term extension wear and survive in my apartment without A/C. He was visibly turned off the first time he saw my real, natural hair and cut our date short.\n\nHe complained that my hair wasn't long, flowy, light-colored, and feminine enough for him to be attracted to me. On one end, I could not afford to keep up with the (dark) long extensions he liked when we met (see point #2) and I also kind of resented his efforts to make the dark-haired woman of color he chose to be in a relationship with into the blonde white woman he seemed to prefer. So I resisted and wore my hair how I needed to to make my life work. But then I noticed we stopped going out in public and we'd only hang out at his place.\n\nI got my hair done in a new style I thought was so beautiful and regal before our last day together. He opened the door and he looked so disappointed. He had me take it down to see how long (i.e. feminine) it could be. Then he told me he wished it was blonde. I picked red to try to surprise him with something new and different (that was also ME). I was really hurt and embarrassed.\n\nAll this put together seemed to translate to \"you've let yourself go and you're not trying to be attractive to me\" through subtle and passive aggressive comments towards the end of our relationship. And he called me up one day and told me it was over. I felt like I got fired as a girlfriend.\n\nSince this breakup, my self esteem is in the toilet. I've spent the past several months transforming myself from the bold, creative, woman of color I was before we met to the sweet, soft, feminine, (white) blonde he wanted just so I can live with myself and not be disgusted with myself when I look in the mirror. I've lost weight, I gave away all my old clothes, opened new credit cards to become a new version of \"pretty.\"\n\nI'm really questioning if I should have listened when he told me to make these changes and if the outcome would have been better or different. I don't want this to happen again in my future relationships.\n\n**TLDR: So my question is... How much compromise is reasonable to keep a partner attracted to you, and when does it cross a line into just incompatibility?**",

Maybe someone has been in a similar situation.. or at the very least just to vent at the frustration and unfairness of it all. Apologies in advanced for the rambling mess I’m about to subject you to… \n\nMy (33f) boyfriend (30m) and I have been in a relationship for just over a year. He - I’ll call him J- was my first serious boyfriend in ten years (the only ex I have was the worst kind of person and put me off ever trying to get close to anyone for the longest time- but that’s a story for another day). I spent over a decade healing and rebuilding myself after him. \nWhen J and I first started dating it was amazing; all happy and exciting and we fell for each other super fast. We couldn’t keep our hands off each other at first. \n\n\nAround the 7 month mark we started to experience some bedroom issues. Now, I should say when we met I considered myself a virgin as I’d never had sex voluntarily before, so all of this was completely new to me. \nWe would be getting hot and heavy and then out of nowhere J would be flaccid. I’m not going to lie, my feelings were hurt but I never let on to J about how it made me feel (I’m guessing some of you know how I was feeling- it was wounding).\nAnyway- at the time he was taking meds for ADHD. Which he decided to have a break from for a while (after consultations with specialists etc). I guess we thought problem solved- but alas, it was not. In fact it got worse. So much to the point where I stopped even trying to initiate and so did he. \nI’m ashamed to admit after this went on for two months we had a HUGE row about the whole thing because when it happened J would completely shut down on me and I’d be left in alone silence wondering what I did wrong. I felt disgusting and disregarded. J said some hurtful things to me that I’m struggling to let go of but; in hindsight I realise my meltdown was very selfish but I was confused and hurt and he wouldn’t talk to me about anything that was going on. I’d convinced myself he no longer found me attractive and our relationship was doomed. \n\n\nA couple of years ago I lost my older brother. He would be the first person I’d call when life was sending me into a spiral and the last few months has made his absence so I incredibly raw for me. It’s almost felt as though I’m grieving all over again (is that even possible?!)\n\n\nI felt (and still do feel) so strongly for J. He’s my person. I know he is. It was hard but i fought for him to open up to me. Eventually after an eternity of struggle he spoke to me of some past traumas he had (I won’t go into detail as it’s not mine to share) and things slowly started to get back on track again, I think there’s still the paranoia that it may happen again but it was getting better. \n\nThen just before Christmas I was diagnosed with cancer. I felt like my world was slipping away and I just wondered why I was even fighting to be happy all. I’ve had an operation to remove some tumours and I’ll have to undergo chemotherapy once I’ve recovered.\nThis has undoubtedly thrown everything up into the air. I don’t think J really got over the nerves I exposed of his past before I got my diagnosis and meanwhile we are having to consider the possibility I’ll never be able to have my own children, so now I’m mourning a future I never had. Not to mention the fact that even if we wanted to have sex we can’t. I was enjoying the intimacy we were building back into our relationship. It was such a struggle to get to where we were and now it seems worse…\nWe have both been hurt in ways you cannot imagine and this just doesn’t seem fair. \nI’ve told J that if he wanted to leave he can; I wouldn’t hold it against him but he’s says he wants to be here with me. \n\n\nI guess, I just feel guilty and hopeless. \nI feel like a shell of the woman I was a year ago. And if I think about it all for too long I break down and cry: I think I’m just done.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/10l04qy/line_between_changing_yourself_compromising_for_a/",
        "text": "Hello ladies! I'm (32F) slowly recovering from a breakup following a whirlwind relationship with a man (52/F) I met online. He was really lovely and had a lot of the qualities I was looking for in a longterm partner. I was so excited to finally meet someone I could see a future with. But he broke up with me after we'd been together for about 8 months after several weeks of signs he was losing interest and attraction to me which was sad and confusing after he REALLY pushed to make our relationship happen REALLY fast and MUCH faster than I was comfortable with. \n\nA few key factors to know before I dive into my question: \n\n1. He was very high income and well established in his career. I'm established in my career, but in a helping profession that ended up not paying off financially. So there was a huge gap between our incomes &amp; lifestyles. He probably earned my annual take home pay in 1-2 months. \n2. A couple weeks into our relationship, I was exhausted and overwhelmed by the amount of time he wanted to spend together and balancing my full time job and 2 part time jobs to make ends meet. So I ended up quitting a part-time job I really needed so I had some breathing room in my schedule and to accommodate all the time he wanted to spend with me. \n3. Also, I am a woman of color with experience in interracial relationships. He was white with no experience even being on a date with a non-white woman before he met me. His \"normal type\" was blonde hair &amp; blue eyes. I have dark skin, eyes, and hair. \n\nWhen we met, he was so excited by how new and different everything was with me. He seemed to love this new version of himself that included dating a woman of color completely different from anyone he'd dated before. \n\nBut then... \n\nFirst he started complaining about my clothes. He didn't like the styles and colors I wore. He wanted me to wear a color palette that didn't exist in my wardrobe and expensive lingerie. Not just nice, but expensive and high-quality only. With the job I quit to spend time with him, I could not afford it. So I did the best I could with his preferences. For example, I could buy a few pieces of cheaper clothes in the colors he liked, but not the expensive quality. I'd never ASK him to take me shopping, and he also never offered. So my look and style couldn't change significantly.  \n\nThen he seemed to be turned off by my body. With all the time he wanted to spend with me and needing to text back and forth with me constantly all day every day, I was too exhausted and drained to keep up with the fitness routine I was doing when we met and ended up gaining about 10 lbs. He was also turned off by how much darker my skin was turning in the summer sun from the lighter shade of brown I was when we met in the winter (I genuinely do not know if he knew people of color could tan). \n\nNext he started complaining about my hair. I had long weave for winter when we met, but when the summer came, I transitioned to shorter braided styles and occasionally wearing my natural hair out to avoid permanent hair loss from long-term extension wear and survive in my apartment without A/C. He was visibly turned off the first time he saw my real, natural hair and cut our date short. \n\nHe complained that my hair wasn't long, flowy, light-colored, and feminine enough for him to be attracted to me. On one end, I could not afford to keep up with the (dark) long extensions he liked when we met (see point #2) and I also kind of resented his efforts to make the dark-haired woman of color he chose to be in a relationship with the blonde white woman he seemed to prefer. So I resisted and wore my hair how I needed to to make my life work. But then I noticed we stopped going out in public and we'd only hang out at his place. \n\nI got my hair done in a new style I thought was so beautiful and regal before our last day together. He opened the door and he looked so disappointed. He had me take it down to see how long (i.e. feminine) it could be. Then he told me he wished it was blonde. I picked red to try to surprise him with something new and different (that was also ME). I was really embarrassed I'd guessed wrong. \n\nAll this put together seemed to translate to \"you've let yourself go and you're not trying to be attractive to me\" to him through subtle and passive aggressive comments towards the end of our relationship. And he called me up one day and told me it was over. I felt like I got fired as a girlfriend. \n\nSince this breakup, my self esteem is in the toilet. I've spent the past several months transforming myself from the bold, creative, woman of color I was before we met to the sweet, soft, feminine, (white) blonde he wanted just so I can live with myself and not be disgusted with myself when I look in the mirror. I've lost weight, I gave away all my old clothes, opened new credit cards to become a new version of \"pretty.\" \n\nI'm really questioning if I should have listened when he told me to make these changes and if the outcome would have been better or different. I don't want this to happen again in my future relationships. \n\n**TLDR: So my question is... How much compromise is reasonable to keep a partner attracted to you, and when does it cross a line into just incompatibility?**",

We are not in regular contact but we were very close when we were young.

His dating profile said he’s going through a recent separation, which could be true—since I haven’t spoken with my friend in quite some time, but again, within a week, he’s still tagging her posts and making reference to his soulmate. \n\nIf it were me, I would want to know. If she were a closer friend, I wouldn’t hesitate. But given I don’t know her marriage status for sure because we’re not close, I don’t want to be responsible for blowing up her life or inserting myself into her business. They have kids, and I also hate to be the messenger that unravels their family. They could also be recently separated, and she just doesn’t realize he’s dating, and it would just hurt her feelings to see it.  I hate having this on my conscience. \n\nWhat would you do??",

We both have very hectic work lives that has us travelling all over and we could relate on how that’s difficult when it comes to dating but glad we found someone who understands how it is. Couple attempts at a first date didn’t come to fruition because of our conflicting schedules but we kept talking anyway because we really enjoyed each other. \n\nI had an extensive and exhausting work engagement that dragged for two weeks and he texted me and cheered me on the whole time, we had amazing conversations. We agreed to go on a date when I got back and he even did hilarious countdown videos to welcome me back home. However we both got sucked in family affairs and couldn’t make it. Then came the holidays, we both visited family out of state. Kept talking the whole time. He got back to nyc before I did so I asked him how was settling back and he told me about his ongoing problem with his siblings which I empathized with and then nothing… \n\nIt’s been a little over two weeks. I know that’s plenty of time to reach out and there’s very little to no excuse (he’s not married he doesn’t have a gf he’s not seeing anyone and he’s a real person that’s all confirmed by a friend who recognized him when I first started talking to him when I showed them his profile (my friend has a mutual friend with him who gave them all the details). I opted out from following each other on socials when we first started talking because I had divested from them for my mental health and also didn’t want to be influenced by his social media presence. I however know from said friend and the mutual that he’s been somewhat active on them since but only liking work related stuff. \n\nI build very slow attraction through emotional connections and it takes me a while to feel that’s why it’s hard for me in this instant gratification world. He knew that and agreed that our conflicting schedule was a blessing in disguise that gave us the time to get to know each other and build a connection. I know most of you would say we never met so it’s not real or that he doesn’t owe me anything but I feel like we’ve convinced ourselves that a lack of empathy is standard behaviour and that anything but traditional connections are real. \n\nMy feelings are real, my pain is real. I didn’t invent, project I wasn’t love bombed either. Sure I was ghosted before by people but it never really affected me. I’m devastated and heartbroken in a way I’ve never experienced it’s fucking with my mental health, my work and my life. \n\nPlease advise. Thank you.",

Google, cousin, and my boyfriend suggested I be blunt w my friend that her lack of social awareness affects me, but I know she’ll feel bad :( how can I word it to her so that she doesn’t feel singled out/ cornered/ attacked please? Thank you in advance !!\n\nI attribute some of her behavior to her sheltered upbringing, and I find myself having to mentally prepare before we spend time tog, so I hang out w her prob every 3 mos bc sometimes after our interactions I’m at a loss at how to navigate the situation. \n\nExamples include:\n\n-one time I jokingly offered to “follow” her on her first online date in a while. It turned out she wanted me around, which is fine, and I told her I’d be in the area getting dinner w boyfriend and lmk if she needed rescuing. She texts me a day or so before letting me know the date will be “x” restaurant bc it’s in my budget. I was taken aback but noted that we will eat elsewhere but nearby \n- explains the obvious/ narrates the show were watching together while watching it\n- explains to me how to budget (I work in finance and support my mom), so I do listen but try to charge topics bc as kuch as new info is great, I do believe in considering the source of info (she geew up fortunate abd most of her expenses covered by her parents)\n- explains mundane things ad nauseum that it dominates the convo( how she chose a vacuum and how cancelling a vacation is a pain)\n- never asks how I am or how my boyfriend or my life is. After I ask her “what’s new w you lady?” She’ll either say oh nothing or go ad nauseum w the previous topics. I wait a bit to share about my life.  \n- I avoid hanging at her parents place (where she lives) bc she’s charged me to eat dinner after inviting me there or asks me to pick up pricey food they ordered.  Each visit i pay literally $100 bc they over order and don’t communicate who got what, so weekday dinner is $700 for 5 people",

I've absolutely loved my space and my company and been very protective of it. I can take myself out alone, I've never lived with a roommate, I have hobbies that do not require me of someone else's company, I have amazing girl-friends. But, I've always, always craved for an emotional comfort. There has never been a time in my life where I was not fantasizing about any boy. I had felt butterflies in my stomach for the first time back in 3rd standard. Since then, the butterflies never left, only the men kept changing. \n\nI'm 23 now. After multiple failed experiences and a major heartbreak, the desperation for emotional need has only increased. The worst part being, as soon as I find someone who is willing to offer me everything, I start to loose feelings. Over time, I have become way too picky too. I've lost the childhood innocence of instantly falling in love. I've had a guy approach me a few days back. I'd really like to go out with him since I've always had a thing for men in uniform, but he's short in height (almost my height). The point here I'm trying to make is, younger me would never have rejected a guy for not being 6 feet.🥲\n\nI want to live alone, feel comfortable with the idea of not having a man in my life for once. How do I do it. I'm young and I get approached by a lot of men (please forgive if I sound like an entitled jerk, I'm just trying to keep my situation here), and it's hard to not consider their proposals especially when you've always been someone who wears her heart on her sleeves. I only want some peace and stability in my life, with or without a guy. I'm pretty much serious for my career and I want to go as far as I can in my professional life, but the emotional craving always takes up half of my mental strength.",

I’m in a super competitive consulting type industry. I’m also bi, mixed race, and a woman, and it just feels like every time I clear a hurdle the next one just keeps on coming. \n\nI made partner a couple of months ago after the WORST slog of imposter syndrome I’ve ever experienced. (At the discussion of partnership meeting I was the only woman and only one of two non white people, amongst other things. There are no queer partners.) \n\nI was pretty proud! Just found out though that because of the type of partnership I applied for, I’m the ONLY partner not invited to partnership meetings. And I found this out by finding every partner in a boardroom but me for a meeting tonight. \n\nTwo other partners admitted at the same time went for a different type of partnership and both got invited to the partnership meeting. \n\nFair enough! But why didn’t anyone tell me in the multiple occasions I asked about partnership and the differences? Or maybe think to mention it so I didn’t find out like this? \n\nI’m fond of my company, but this week alone I’ve also had to point out some inadvertently biased language in a policy (no one else noticed) then take almost an hour and a half of my time to explain the problem and work through a solution. I guess I didn’t have to, but then that burden could hit someone junior to me. \n\nSo looking for a bit of inspiration, internet friends! What drives you to keep going? \n\n99% of the time for me it’s because I am not going to let society win. And there are juniors who came up to me and were cheering me on and I won’t let them down, either.

        "text": "Hi friends,\n\nI (F33) lost my ten year old American Staffy to terminal cancer last September. I was absolutely devastated. He was the best thing to ever happen to me. It happened within three days (diagnosis to human euthanasia).\n\nHe was there for me during my chemotherapy, he’d lie in the bathroom with me while I was sick, he’d lie like a human next to me in bed with his head on a pillow. He was there during my divorce, my pregnancy, he would watch over my baby when he was little etc etc. \n\nIt was the biggest loss I have a ever experienced. I cried and moped and reminisced and felt guilty and angry and all the emotions. Over the next couple of months the grief became easier to deal with. I didn’t cry at the thought of him any more, I felt sad but had almost accepted it.\n\nI have decided to adopt a rescue dog and they will be picked up this week. \n\nAll of a sudden it’s like the day he was diagnosed all over again. I can’t stop crying. I can’t stop thinking about him. I’ve spent the last week like this. It feels just like when it happened. \n\nI’ve never had a traumatic experience be triggered like this before whereby it feels as thought I’m starting all over again within my grief. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Will it stop? Any advice?",

He doesn’t want a long-distance relationship, so I’m trying not to get too attached, but I’d still like to have a few fun experiences like we had before (even just a few days ago).

I am having fun and enjoy meeting new people and the attention but I am struggling to understand what I really want. The other day I was talking to my friend and was telling her a recent dating story she just looked at me and said you don’t seem to have your priorities straight. You should be setting goals for yourself like having a mortgage, settling down, having more children but none of these goals are appealing to me. I want to advance in my career, travel more, focus on being a great mom and have the freedom and peace to date. I am finally happy again. I don’t want to go back to the life I once had. My social circle consists of mostly married moms but I look at their lives and think I am good and don’t feel I am missing anything. Do other women who are divorced also feel this way?",

        "text": "I'm looking for some suggestions. If you have a better sub, please direct me there. But I'm wondering if it's also part of how women's brain works.\n\nI went back to school shortly over a year ago. I quit my full time job at that time and I work part time now about 1-2 days a week. I used to dream of having this much free time when I was working around 55hrs a week. Now, after a year of doing this, I'm feeling bored and it makes it hard for me to keep up my motivation.\n\nI have all the things I want to accomplish throughout the day such as I want to workout, school work, make dinner, spend time training our puppy, cleaning.\n\nTypical day goes like this - I wake up and I think ok where should I start? I want to workout but I always think I'll do it later. I end up spending too much time cleaning because I like a clean place. Then I sit down to do schoolwork, but my mind wanders to something I haven't completed yet but wanted to. (I think after a year of staying home alone all day working on schoolwork, I'm feeling lonely and bored with it.) For example, I start watching dog training videos. Then I realize something is dirty and I get up to clean it instead of schoolwork. Then try to do more schoolwork but it's dinner time so I spend about an hour cooking and cleaning up. Then I may or may not go workout. Then usually I take dog on a walk or try to work on training him. Then frustrated that I didn't train him more throughout the day.\n\nI think I need help determining how to focus on one task at a time. And I guess feeling motivated throughout the day. I have a hard time understanding that all the little work builds into an accomplishment down the road. I just want to see the immediate accomplishment.\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem?",

        "text": "I'm a 32M dating a 23F for the past 15 months (living together for 7). Long story short she had plans on moving to the West Coast last spring after her lease was up. She temporarily moved in with me, then it became permanent when she backed out. We've had talks where she flat out told me she debated braking up with me for this move but loves me too much and wants to make it work.\n\nWe also got in another heated argument this summer right before a family vacation I was bringing her with. Not to go too much into details but she accused me of some nasty things and I told her hey I think i'd be a good idea just let me go home this week. I'll give you time/space, we'll cool off and turn the page when I get back. She was pissed and said I embarrassed her to family friends not bringing her along. Honestly I didn't see it as a big deal (I paid for her flight) so I was out the money and I thought some space would do us good. She was upset and after we talked it over when I got back she again mentioned she debated breaking up with me, but we made up things were seemingly good.\n\nAnyway just wanted to mention these prior 2 instances for context...\n\nFast forward semi recently her friends came into town for the weekend. They all went clubbing and got sloshed. I stayed up waiting for them had beds made, made them all late night snacks and we all stayed up talking. Around 430 am my gf says she's taking a shower and asks if I wanted to sit in the bathroom with her. So I sat on the toilet just listening to her drunk ramble in the shower about her absentee father growing up and some childhood trauma etc.\n\nGranted it's like 430AM I'm tired after staying up waiting for them/taking care of them so I must've glanced at my phone just scrolled thru my texts legit not really even thinking. My gf poked her head out and said glad your phone is more important than my childhood stories and got pissed.\n\nMy GF gets out of the shower and said the following things to me:\n\n\\- I used to tell my mom there are no good men in this world until I met you, that's clearly not true\n\n\\- Moving in with me was the worst decision of her life\n\n\\- I have 0 emotional intelligence, I'm a piece of shit fucking loser\n\n\\- I'm gonna continue wearing slutty outfits, you have no idea how many DMs I get\n\n\\- Only thing I ever wanted was to get in her pants (which i said thats funny you said I played hard to get and you laughed you had to take initiative by finally bringing an overnight bag to my house 7 months after dating when we planned to go to brunch lol)\n\n\\- Go on text all the other girls in your phone, Idc if you go out and F them\n\n\\- It's emotionally tolling having a bf / being in a relationship\n\nSo I then asked her do you mean all this? She said yep! So I got my jacket and started walking around the city 430am-830 since she had all friends over, I didn't want to make a scene and I had no place to go. As I was walking I jotted down everything she said to me to confront her when I got back. When I got home I plopped into bed and she tried snuggling me I said I'm tired I just need to sleep babe.\n\nAnyway I told my buddy about this incident the next day and he was genuinely concerned. He said she's emotionally manipulating me and to get out. I talked to my gf later that night she didn't show much concern was like I'm sorry I was drunk I was saying dumb stuff. I went to pull up my notes on my phone to address what she said and she kinda rolled her eyes like seriously you made a note of all this? It wasn't the most productive conversation. Is this something worth looking past like hey this is a 1x drunk thing or is really bad?\n\nFor context too I'm a homebody I literally play mens leagues sports with my buddies 2x a week, or am either downstairs at my condo gym, or hanging around my place learning coding or just watching tv. For her to stay stuff like go text other girls it's crazy I don't associate with the nightlife, I don't mess around or give her a reason to doubt me. Also I allegedly embarrassed my gf 1 time while I was out drinking (which i rarely do) so since then I made it a point to cut drinking. And like the other 2 most recently times I was tipsy drinking the past few months out in the city, I stopped and picked up my gf a cookie from our fav spot in the city and brought her back ice cream the other time and she laughed like it was the cutest thing. Basically I'm the opposite when I see my gf tipsy, I'm so happy to see her, so i find it hard to deal with her berating me while drunk and don't see it as a valid excuse...",
