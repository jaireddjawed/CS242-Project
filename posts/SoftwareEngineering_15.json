The tool should be based on an empirical study or any research papers or should contribute to the betterment of Software Engineering process.\n\nSome of the example projects are :\n\n1. Which framework should I choose? Visualizing existing uses of code/APIs/frameworks\n\n2. End User Software Engineering - How to help developers improve software productivity, help with bug resolution....?\n\n3. Assessing quality/metrics of similar projects on Github\n\n4. Visualizing and Analysing [a Data Source/Multiple Datasources] StackOverflow Data Dump\netc..\n\nInitially I thought of developing a plugin/extension to enhance github search engine for better results (to facilitate complex queries with a user friendly interface) but soon realized they already had the advanced search option. So I thought to extend it by adding extra functionality like for eg to make it easy to search for code samples of a library or API usage in repositories. I want to know whether if it's feasible.\n\nIs it any useful? Can you help me by suggesting some good extensions? \n\nOr do you have any new ideas?\n\nPS : English is not my first language.

I'm looking into building my skillsets early on so I can have a good chance in landing good internships in the next year to gain experience with working for companies. I have a set of questions that if any one could provide further information on, I would appreciate your input very much. It would not only help me understand the path towards becoming a good software engineering, but I will be utilizing your response as part of my primary source for a technical communications course. Thank you all! Here is the set of questions: \n\n&gt;1. What is your job title, place of employment (could ignore), and how did you get started as such?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Can you provide a specific description as to the job of a software engineer? From being assigned a project to publishing the work to your boss, what are the processes involved in such?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Can you describe communication in your employment? Through which medias do you generally communicate through?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. What work experience did you have before being employed at your current job? What skills did it teach you that were important while working your current employment?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Are there any important organizations that you know of for software engineers? What does it offer?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;6. Are there any challenges as in the field upcoming software engineer I should know about? What difficulties have you experienced, or have seen others experience?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;7. What is one of the biggest ethical concerns with software engineers currently?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;8. Why has this remained a prominent concern? What can software engineers do about it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;9. How has such ethical concerns affected end-users? Do you know any prominent examples of the effects of such concerns?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10. Have you experienced this issue yourself? If so, have you been involved with any solutions to the problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Would I still be able to pursue a career in Software Engineering if I went into Computer Engineering? Or should I take the computer science program and go into software engineering that way??\n\n(SIDENOTE: At the moment, I have close to zero experience with coding, other than intro courses with Java. Are there any decent and cheap online courses to give me a headstart with coding?)",

I recently resigned from my position as a pastor--my degree is in biblical studies and isn't really accredited anywhere. This past month, I took the [MOOC.fi](https://MOOC.fi) Java course and CS50, and I'm really hoping to somehow progress quickly enough (I've been going flat-out for a bit) to get some kind of software development-related employment by January.\n\nI have a couple developer acquaintances that thought that didn't sound feasible w/o a degree or a bootcamp, and suggested that I take a couple years to learn PHP and Wordpress and get a small role in web development (which was according to them, the same as software development).\n\nLooking for suggestions on what to focus on atm. Unfortunately we don't have finances for me to go to Uni and 3 months away for a bootcamp isn't an option (for now). I'm really interested in helping to build apps and back-end stuff, but in the short term I'd be happy with doing just about whatever coding job might lead to marketable experience.  \n\n\nEdit: I started the courses on Aug 28th. I know they're pretty basic, but I'm hoping that gives an idea of the pace I'm willing to put in right now (been working fulltime as well).",

While on the surface this is a good problem to have as an employer, as an employee, it doesn't feel that way to me.  I have noticed a common thread with management where they reward people who work crazy hours with more responsibility and prestige, over people who work more normal hours.  Case in point, there is a junior developer on a project that I am a lead on.  He routinely works 80+ hour weeks (and has been doing so for over a year), while I usually only work 50-60 hour weeks.  50-60 hours is enough where I already have no life outside work.  I definitely don't want to work more.  Especially since I'm between 10-20k underpaid for my experience in the area.  Yet management has been slowly giving responsibilities that were mine over to him, mainly because he is willing to work 100 hour weeks and I am already over-tasked so I cannot get my work done.  How do I deal with this situation and not end up like the guy from office space sitting in the basement? lol  It seems like the only solution is to leave the company.",

        "text": "Hey fellow developers,\n\nI've got a question in my mind about the notifyObservers() method when using the Observer pattern. Like there are 2 main ways in calling notifyObservers():\n\n1. **The observed data object (ConcreteModel) calls notifyObservers() after a change is registered.**\n2. **The Observer (ConcreteObserver) calls notifyObservers() after a change is registered.**\n\nLike what are disadvantages or advantages of this? Is it in any way important how I call them (**seen from a software engeering standpoint!**). I see that 2. leads to more interlinking between the 2 classes, which shouldn't be too good.. But what do you think is the better approach and why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nX-Post from r/softwaredevelopment",

        "text": "I feel like I have stagnated in my career and I haven't learnt anything much. I have been working for close to 3.5-4 yrs and I still feel I have the same knowledge as a just graduated college student. I did not really learn much in my second and third job.I really want to get better in my career. So what I did was to look for a new job. But the recruiters/new companies that are hiring were expecting me to have knowledge of a person who worked for 3.5 yrs. There is only couple of technologies that I can say I am competent enough. Probably C++ and Python. I am really willing to work down a level to my experience warrants with less salary than what I am earning currently. I feel a good job is the identity of me and my happiness is awfully lot based on how happy I am at work. Any help/ideas/ to improve my current position would be really welcome. Especially any ideas to start with a job that requires one or two years less experience than what I have or your experience if you have gone through my current situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 2014 March - 2015 November \n   * Amazing work. Enjoyed my work and wanted to go to work everyday.\n   * Worked in C++, SQL, Android, iOS, PHP everything that I could get hands on.\n   * Lost the job in a day because company went bankrupt  because of financial mishandling \n* 2016 March - 2017 September\n   * Took up job as infrastructure developer in network based company.\n   * Decent enough job. Worked mostly in Python with C++ here and there sometimes.\n   * Whole group were laid off and the project was shut down for lack of revenue. \n* 2018 March - Now\n   * Working in a complete network based company.\n   * Got acquired by another company within one month of joining.\n   * Literally no work and no project for the last couple of months since then.\n   *  I can really see the lay off coming for a good number of my colleagues in the next few months once they start consolidating and intergrating the teams (Even I felt the engineering team was bigger than what is needed and based on the revenue that company generates).\n   * Worked only in C++ ",
