        "text": "Hi all! To elaborate on the title, I recently found out about the genre of [Filk music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filk_music), and I am in love with the idea of music that tells a space story. I'm hoping some of you fine people have some hidden gems, particularly about original concepts.\n\nWhat I'm not too keen on is the scratchy, southern, slightly-inebriated sound of most Filk songs. I understand the Folk music movement of the 60's inspired a lot of Filk, but I'm really not a fan of the old record style. Remakes are fine, it's just the audio style that I dislike.  \nFor example, [here's (what I think is) the original version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyVuuXUR7Lc) of Dawson's Christian, and [here is a (relatively) recent cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnRwgzjFLpE) that I've much enjoyed.\n\nI've been cruising through the selections on [filkyeahfilk.com](https://filkyeahfilk.com) and found some decent ones, but I crave more songs that aren't about established IP's like Star Trek, Star Wars, Dr. Who, Firefly, etc.\n\nSorry if this is a detailed or too-specific ask, like I said I just discovered this genre of music and I'm enamored with the idea :D  \nThanks for any suggestions!",

        "text": "Tell if this sounds like a good idea for a story explaining different kinds of dimensions. \n\n\\-First is a pocket universe. Its a small dimensional space that exists in the folds of space time. They were created by the universe due to it constantly expanding over the years due to the whole inflationary theory.  They're basically called \"Bubble universes\". Even though they contain an observable universe its actually the dimensional barrier that surrounds their universe that extends all the way to the Kuiper belt of their solar system. They exists somewhere on a lower level in the universe  between the multiverse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bubble universe](https://preview.redd.it/7ynmcivl4y5a1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77fb36b4a3977219cbe920c5ce9a1945e4ca7a54)\n\n[A terra firma world](https://preview.redd.it/mbuq12vj2y5a1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c49d2ca7cbe6707974f2e8a1dff90955ef23695)\n\nThey can sometimes look earth-like. Some that would either have continents similar to earth, or other land formations or other countries. They can even have different cultures similar to our world. They're basically called \"Terra firma\", worlds.\n\n[Border region](https://preview.redd.it/6zbvm29g0y5a1.png?width=1321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ca1512375f20c5a6ae1b017ebe18fbe6c03b2301)\n\n(Please note a pocket dimensional is a small dimensional space can be created be either magic users or powerful entities for storage, recreation, or prisons. Its basically like having your own island you can put inside your own closet)\n\n\\-Second an alternate dimensional world can possess its own unique world with different landscapes, but would have different color skies, more than one moon, and how time can move different either  faster or slower depending how long you stay. Like one day can be like a week in our timeline, or one week is either seven hours for example. They exists somewhere on a different level in the universe.\n\n[Alternate dimensional world](https://preview.redd.it/f5repauj3y5a1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=deaad92877900ab8472e53291d3e7a4ac92ddf67)\n\nTheir universe would be the size of a spiral galaxy like m51 for example\n\n[Dimensional universe](https://preview.redd.it/t8tg5wnm3y5a1.png?width=2784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=56087e273e4013430728690aef772ce775f8c298)\n\nLastly is an extradimensional space. Its a higher dimensional plane possessing its own laws of physics which would exists on a higher level in the universe.\n\n[Extradimensional plane](https://preview.redd.it/f7j2f8fv3y5a1.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d3eeaceddf81302799c19fe2ddd9641fc597598e)\n\nSo yeah that its.

Please bear with me as I explain my concern, then formulate my question.\n\nIn many of the SF videos I have watched, when a spaceship gets attacked, while the spaceship survives more more-or-less intact, lots of interior bits -- mainly control consoles and such stuff -- get all explodey. \n\nIt's like humans in the 24th century (or whatever) have forgotten about relays, fuses, and circuit breakers...\n\nSo, my question: Is it the case that future humans have forgotten about relays, fuses &amp; circuit breakers or do such devices impose such an enormous mass penalty on a spaceship that they are not installed?\n\nThanks in advance for your comments.",

        "text": "Our older dog is name Ellie. The inspiration came from Dr. Ellie Sattler from Jurassic Park and Eleven from Stranger Things. Michael Crichton is my favorite author so it was an easy choice. But now we have a new puppy to name and are coming up dry on inspiration. We have a million boy dog names queued up, but no girls!\n\nMy SO strongly believes that dogs have to have two syllable names that end in an -ee or -ay sound. I will concede that 3 syllables is probably okay, but I do like the -ee or -ay ending rule.\n\nWe consume pretty much all nerd culture: 3 Body Problem, Ender Series, Crichton, Jordan, Sanderson, Rothfuss, The Expanse, The 100, Red Rising, Stranger Things, GoT, LotR, Star Wars, Stargate, Pokémon, AtlA, you get it. If it's been made, we're probably a fan.\n\nSo far we have:\n- Auri\n- Buffy\n- Suki\n- Roci (Rocinante)\n- Eevee\n- Sammy (Samantha Carter)\n- Asami\n- Padme\n- Ciri or Ceres\n- Ripley\n- Atari\n\nAny help is appreciated. We're having such a rough time naming her. She's got red, sleek fur if that helps anyone!",

And I apologize for the paywall after a few story sections. I got abused by people loggging out and making new accounts running a up a tab of hundreds of dollars in compute (I’m not doing this with any funding and large language models cost a fortune to serve). \n\nId love to get your feedback on what would make this better for the sci-fi community. As an Asimov fan, I have to say I feel a little bit like we can talk to Multivac for the first time in human history and it excites me beyond words.",
