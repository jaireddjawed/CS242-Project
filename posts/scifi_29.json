I’ve definitely gotten caught up in the classics (I guess maybe that will affect my chances of getting published at all, but hey whatever)\n\nI am looking for books written in the past two years that are similar to “the outside” by Ada Hoffman my book delves into AI and the intersection between a human consciousness in the throes of a psychedelic trip, and how his empathy alters the AI and society as a result. So there are some esoteric elements that soften any hard sci-fi aspects. \n\nIf anybody would be kind enough to throw some recommendations my way that I can read and cite in my query letter.\n\nThanks in advance!",

He chooses to explore. \n\nIf anyone recognises this book from my limited description I would be most grateful.\n\nTIA.",

        "text": "&gt;...Coleman needn’t have warned her to stay silent, for Julia would have found no words. The room beyond was far larger than the tight, darkened corridors preceding it might have suggested. She felt as though she’d strayed into the temple of a dead god. She had never been particularly religious, but there was... a feeling. The palpable sense that she had made a terrible mistake. That she was a child, misbehaving and moments from incurring the wrath of someone larger and older.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Either side of her, darkness. Above her, darkness. Before her, columns of technology; rounded stacks of neatly configured machines that exploded into woven arcs of cables overhead. The columns glistened and twinkled with a thousand lights reflecting on a thousand dark metal surfaces, and there was the collective murmur of fans, as if the whole room were alive and breathing, slow and steady like a sleeping giant. Underfoot, metal grating; lights in the depths like starlight reflected upon a sea, and among those stars, there were strange machine configurations like a dense bed of clashing optical illusions; the sense of perpetual movement born of absolute stillness whenever her eyes passed over it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;There came a sound. Different. Not the fans. Not the hum of power. From below, there came a sound that conjured forth the image of a serpent with metal scales, slithering through oil and muck, its fangs dripping hydraulic fluid. Julia could think of no machine that might make such a noise. Still no actual movement, but the sound grew more intense. Upon the columns, screens lit up. Back-lit blackness, like the inky eyes of something terrible awoken by the gentle sound of their footsteps.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Julia stopped.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Coleman continued on towards those eyes, and a blinking white prompt appeared on each screen as he passed them. Walking between the columns, his suit lights cast long shadows that reached out from him like the limbs of a great black spider. Suddenly afraid of being left alone in this place, even if the alternative was to move deeper into it, Julia followed him.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;She couldn’t tell if the machines were waiting to spring a trap, or simply waiting because they were uncertain, trying to assess the motives of the interlopers, but she and Coleman progressed without incident, deeper and deeper into a room whose grand dimensions felt increasingly implausible.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;She searched the shadows for her own reflection, thinking that perhaps the far walls were lined with mirrors, but there was only darkness and more of those columns. Ever in the corner of her eye, they seemed like statues waiting to be brought to life. Or like the tombstones in the memorial cavern back home, among which the children claimed a monster lurked late at night, stealing the names and faces of the dead.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Was this its true home, perhaps?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Far from the door, deep inside the machine forest, they came upon a clearing. It might have been the centre of the chamber. It might have been one of many such clearings. There were bodies here. No visible wounds, no damage to their suits. It was as if they had simply dropped dead without any struggle, without any pain. They were gathered around...   \n&gt;  \n&gt;...Well, what words could she use to describe it?    \n&gt;  \n&gt;A nest?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was nothing organic here, nothing *living* at least, but there was no better word. Dark cables draped down from the shadows above, converging from far and wide, and where they met here in the middle of this strange place, they twisted and tangled until they formed a *nest.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the heart of this nest, there was a cage or... a clasp? A spindly contraption of metal, with many limbs, many joints, all serving to contain or protect a solitary cube within.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The cube was outwardly unremarkable, save for its flawless machining; it was apparently metal, grey and matte like solid iron, no more than half a metre across. In the middle of the clasp, at the heart of the nest of cables, it sat there like the dullest of jewels, and the dead men encircled it below, as if in worship.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The cube looked out of place. Everything here looked out of place, that was true, but while she could not claim to understand all the technology at work here, she knew enough to understand that the cube was not the *same.*    \n&gt;  \n&gt;No flickering lights, no whirring fans, no switches, no ports. It seemed completely inert, and yet... and yet it was highly active, and functioning. It was a machine. She knew this. She could *feel* it the closer she came; a deep and rhythmic throbbing behind her eyes, in her ears, upon her face and under her teeth, as if a chorus of deafening noise were screaming at her, as if the wind *howled* at her... in absolute silence.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;And though it defied all logic and sanity, every time she blinked she felt certain that she had seen a... a *flash*. A flash of light, from the cube.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;No, not *from* the cube. It *was* the cube. The cube’s grubby grey surfaces emitted no light, and yet every time she blinked, she caught a glimpse of some wondrous glow, like piercing a veil of illusion and seeing the cube for what it truly was; a thing of perfect brilliance and beauty; a structure of pure, dazzling light that penetrated her eyelids with ease.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;They made no sense, these words in her head, nor did the feeling that some silent, invisible force was pouring from every featureless face of the cube, flooding the chamber with something unseen and intangible yet unmistakably heavy.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;She stared in awe, and confusion. And then words appeared upon every screen, upon every column in the darkness around this strangely sacred place, rigid and vaguely threatening, and very familiar.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;“SILENCE IS GOLDEN.”   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strange serpent sounds from below grew a little louder, and Julia began to feel the anxious tugging of instinct. With a horrifying escalation of certainty, she felt as though her life were in danger. She wanted to run, but the machine-serpent’s hiss was coming from every direction, as if the sea of technology beneath her feet was about to erupt with a thousand blades and shred her, toe to skull.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Coleman looked almost as terrified she felt, and yet somehow he was resolute. He was expecting this. Reminding her not to speak, with a wide-eyed glare and a gesture, he removed that little notebook once more and flicked quickly through its pages.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Ashme Dai!’ he announced, calling out to the serpent as one might summon a wayward child. ‘By name compelled! Commanded, obey!’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Silence fell upon the world like the lid of a stone sarcophagus slamming shut. She may well have imagined it, but the screens... they twitched. Flickered, for less than a second, as if startled or in pain...\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvcsim0cavaa1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f603dd5df69f5eced6f8fbd0682bd4bf33659d",

People are divided between the poor masses and the rich elite. \n\nThe whole premise of this movie is brilliant, and I very much enjoy how they portray it on film. But I have been thinking about the technology behind the clock on your arm. I came up with a theory that could explain it a little.\n\nThe clock is luminescent and seems to be the result of bioengineering. What if there was an organism or a bacteria, presumably in a symbiotic relationship with the body, so that it gets accepted by the organism and can work without hiccups, that would regenerate your cells to a 100% of what they were, when you (for example) irradiate the organism with a certain type of radiation.\n\nAnd the demand for the irradiation would be kept in check by distributing a container of lets say gas that you would use as a fuel for the radiation, so you make a container that can hold up to a year of radiation, you distribute that and you keep the container that is filled more. from the smaller one, you get profit, since you make the people you gave the time to to make you more time. \n\n  \nI think this theory has some logic behind it, what do you think?",

I loved its eeriness (I was a kid. Yes, I'm old.) There was tech gadgetry but not much of it. I recall glowing crystals. No special effects, no memorable costumes. It did not air in prime time. It was low-budget filler shown in in the early evening, before or after the news. \n\nYes, I have googled but cannot find it.",

They were all chattering to each other in their high-pitched language that pinged off her frill and set the tips of her antenna tingling unpleasantly. She suppressed a compression and stepped to the side of the corridor, hoping that their agitation had nothing to do with her.\n\n“Doctor!” Twenty-Five Clicks called out, barely bringing his voice down into a polite range.\n\nSecond Sister sighed and laid her frill in a neutral flatness even if she couldn’t quite control the tight curl of her antenna. The Winged were so very impolite. But she had a job to do if they were using her work title instead of her name. She cast a single longing thought towards her comfortable perch in her chambers and then turned her attention to the approaching flight.\n\n“Base commander,” she greeted the Winged.\n\nThe thirty-odd little mammals spent a moment vying for the few surfaces on her body where they could perch and then the rest settled for clinging to the walls. They were still chattering worriedly among themselves but now their eyes were focused on their wing leader. Twenty-Five Clicks was clearly taking a moment to compose himself by grooming his sensory horns with his winghooks. Second Sister waited for him to finish with what she hoped was patience. He finally looked up into one of her eyes and took a deep breath. He pointed one wing towards the communal work space.\n\n“Human Friend Pierce,” he finally managed to say.\n\nSecond Sister fought the urge to extend her frill and simply began walking in the indicated direction. She should have known it would take some form of human madness to set the Winged to such frantic flight.\n\n“What precisely is the matter with Human Friend Pierce?” she asked.\n\nThe Undulate naming system that the Winged had adapted felt sticky on her mandibles, but she knew calling First Brother by his proper name would only confuse the flight of Winged further.  They were currently following her by hoping along the catwalks that lined the higher levels of the walls, avoiding flight in order to stay calm and focused. Finally one, presumable the flight medic, managed to speak.\n\n“He has taken severe outer membrane damage,” the medic said.\n\nSecond Sister tilted her head at him sharply.\n\n“What wasn’t this called in as a medical emergency?” She asked.\n\n“He insisted he was fine,” Twenty-Five Clicks interjected. “And he is not listed as a stupidly stubborn human in his records. We decided to get you to come analyze the damage before we set the alarms ringing.”\n\n“Reasonable,” Second Sister agreed as she paced along. “Humans are famous for being able to take damage to their outer membranes.”\n\n“Yes,” the flight medic agreed. “They are covered in that forest of micro-fauna that protects them.”\n\n“And they have that massive layer of fat under it all too,” another pointed out.\n\n“Landers,” Twenty-Five Clicks said in a grumbling tone.\n\n“Is there something you are hiding from me?” Second Sister finally asked bluntly.\n\nTellingly the entire flight fell silent as they approached the door to the communal work area. They glanced back and forth at each other, using their narrow binocular vision to avoid her broad gaze. Finally the medic spoke up.\n\n“We have speculation that we do not wish to share,” he explained, “as it is all but baseless.”\n\n“I would appreciate it,” Second Sister said curtly.\n\n“Well,” the medic squirmed from his perch on her primary joint. “The damage seems to be a reversed image of Undulate text. It appears random-”\n\n“But you fear that he may have deliberately applied the damage to himself,” Second Sister concluded. “That it is some form of ritual scarification?”\n\nAn uncomfortable murmur spread through the flight and Twenty-Five Clicks  fluffed himself out in indignation.\n\n“Human Friend Pierce is an exemplary Ranger,” he snapped. “He would not waste time on personal decoration of any sort while on duty.”\n\n“And this occurred while he was on duty?”  Second Sister asked.\n\n“Yes,” the medic hurriedly interjected. “He went into the tactile isolation console to work on his Undulate translation and had the damage when he came out.”\n\n“I thought he was doing field work today?” Second Sister asked.\n\n“He had a bad night,” Twenty-Five clicks explained. “Something to do with digestion and that new plant protein he tried yesterday, and he didn’t feel that he was competent to maneuver the transport safely. So he decided to work on his training.”\n\nSecond Sister clicked thoughtfully to herself as she opened the door. First Brother was at the far side of the large open space sipping a cup of the common human stimulant. He was slumping against the counter in that nearly Undulate way humans had when they were extremely tired. She eyed him critically.\n\n“Where exactly is this damage?” She asked the Winged.\n\n“Right on his face,” Twenty-Five Clicks said. “The wide fleshy part.”\n\nSecond Sister  gave a confused click and paced forward to get closer to the human. She heard a chatter of confusion start up among the Winged as they approached the human and the sound seemed to catch his notice. He lifted his head and blinked at them slowly.\n\n“Second Sis,” he greeted her before letting his oral cavity gape in an attempt to draw in more oxygen.\n\n“First Brother,” she replied with a polite tilt of her head.\n\nHe returned the gesture, causing the light to fall over one side of his face and she suddenly saw the damage the Winged had seen. There were indeed many reversed lines of the sprawling Undulate language imprinted on his epidermis.\n\n“It was way worse!” one of the Winged above her insisted.\n\n“What was worse lil guy?” First Brother asked, squinting up at him.\n\n“Your face,” Second Sister informed him.\n\nHe stared blankly at her and she reached up to grasp his chin with one hand, turning his face to examine the damage. His eyes tracked hers in that rolling, disconcerted way humans did for a few seconds until he burst out laughing.\n\n“Something’s wrong with my face?” he asked.\n\n“You have taken damage,” she replied. “It looks like pressure damage.”\n\nThe human gave one of those deep lunged grunts that only his giant mammalian lungs could produce and easily pulled his chin out of her grasp. He turned to the reflective surface of the nutrient warming device and titled his head to get a look at the fading marks.\n\n“Ah,” he said, “I fell asleep while practicing Undulate touch writing. The reversed grooves must have left these marks.”\n\n“Do they pose any danger to you?” Second Sister asked.\n\n“Nah,” the human dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. “S’like corduroy line or whatnot.”\n\n“That give me no relevant information,” Second Sister pointed out.\n\nFirst Brother stared at her with blank, unfocused eyes for several long moments, giving Second Sister plentiful time to assess the situation. The Winged were still disturbed and the human was clearly not operating at full mental capacity.\n\n“First Brother,” she said firmly. “It is my opinion as the base medic that you should spend the rest of the day resting in your quarters.”\n\n“But,” whatever First Brother was about to say in protest was lost in a massive yawn that seemed to stretch out his spine and curl his entire body in odd directions.\n\n“Maybe you got a point,” he said when the yawn was done. “I’ll get back to bed.”\n\n“And this flight will escort you,” Second Sister said quickly.\n\n“Sure, sure,” First Brother said, holding out his hands invitingly as he shuffled towards the door.\n\nThe Winged followed their Human Friend Pierce eagerly, abandoning Second Sister to the blissful silence of the now empty work space. If she hurried she might be able to make it back to her perch before there was another medical oddity.\n\n# Please go leave a review on my 3rd book \"Humasn are Weird: Let's Work it Out\"\n\n## [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n## [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n## [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n## [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fm65owqdxpaa1.gif",

Humans and aliens have both created countless AI-equipped spaceships to help them out. One day, for seemingly no reason, all sentient organic beings suddenly drop dead. The spaceships, and other mechanical sophonts, must now build a civilization of their own. The series follows UHS freighter William Mackie, science research vessel Maya Hironaga, and Ocanar warship Otto. Together, they will explore the galaxy, encounter strange new spacecraft, and try to discover what led to the death of all intelligent organic beings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been a fan of Spaceships for quite a while now. I discovered them over on the r/audiodrama subreddit back when they only had one episode out. It was around the same time I discovered Residents of Proserpina Park. Incidentally, this was also back when Residents of Proserpina Park only had one episode out. The premise looked interesting, so I decided to give it a listen. I liked what I heard, and I eagerly awaited more episodes. This came in due time, and here we are now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite the rather macabre premise, I can best describe Spaceships as a dramedy. There’s plenty of moments of levity and humor to balance out the action and humor. Series creator Filip Momirovski also includes a fair bit of social commentary and satire about human nature. For example, it is mentioned that humans frequently stereotyped the Ocanar as being violent and warlike. However, humanity itself was prone to getting into quite a few wars with other races. So, it was kind of a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Well, that and the war with the Ocanar was also started over stupid reasons. The Ocanar live underground, and don’t mix well with flash photography. The human delegation, unfortunately, forgot this at an attempted peace talk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also see that self-driving cars have finally become a thing. Though, they’re all rather prone to road rage. That episode also included some jabs about how humanity has been taking its sweet time with trying to combat climate change. Wait, so the self-driving cars are now the dominant intelligent lifeforms on Earth. Does this mean that Spaceships is secretly a prequel to Pixar’s Cars movies? Hmm, nah, probably just an amusing coincidence. Especially since none of the sentient vehicles are anthropomorphic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFilip Momirovski has said that, should Spaceships ever be adapted as an animated series, a lot of the humor would come from the fact that the spaceships all look like normal non-sentient spaceships. He envisions there being points where the camera would do a close up on the spaceships, but they’d just look like, well, non-anthropomorphic spaceships. An animated adaptation is probably not in the cards any time in the near future. However, Spaceships is being adapted as a comic book. It is being released on the Spaceships Patreon page at a time. Also, for those wondering, the spaceships on the series title card are, from left to right and moving in a circle, Otto, Will, and Maya. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, let’s discuss the characters. Will is a freighter with the personality of a frat boy. He’s impulsive, scatterbrained, immature, and can be a bit of a horndog at times. In fairness, a lot of this can be blamed on Will’s crew. They were all really into trashy reality television, and Will tends to use what he learned from those shows as a guide to life. Still, despite his flaws, Will always tries to do right by his friends. There’s almost nothing he can’t accomplish when he really put his mind to it. Of course, given how easily distracted Will can be, this is easier said than done. Will tends to be the one who provides the comic relief throughout the series. Will is voiced by Bobby Gaglini. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtto is an Ocanar warship. He’s stern, serious, and is comically bound to the Ocanar code of valor. Otto is very quick to suggest just shooting whatever problems the spaceships come across. Much like Will, this can be blamed on his upbringing. The Ocanar are, basically, Klingons. So, it is only natural that Otto would be so aggressive and warlike. Well, that and, you know, he’s a warship. And to be fair, he’s not always wrong when he advocates for shooting things. Though he wouldn’t be quick to admit it, deep down, Otto does value Will and Maya as friends. Otto is voiced by Bobby Gaglini, and I must say, never would have guessed that Otto and Will shared a voice actor. In fact, Bobby voiced several male characters on Spaceships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the main trio is Maya. She is a science research vessel. The extinction of humanity hit her the hardest. She’s always been fascinated by humans, and was quite close to her crew. She’s the most level-headed of the main trio, and often has to talk Will and Otto out of their especially harebrained schemes. Maya initially doesn’t care much for Will and his advances, but she warms up to him with time. Maya is also the most determined to find out why organic beings have all dropped dead at once. If nothing else, she can’t let her crews’ deaths have been for nothing. She’s also determined to help spaceships establish a new civilization; hopefully, one that is free from the flaws of the organics. Maya is voiced by Arson Alfaro. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must take a moment to compliment the music and soundscaping. It is all very professional, and quite high-quality, especially for an indie show. It is easily on par with anything you might find at a major podcast production studio. Major credit to Vlad O, who handles the sound-design. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’s also an extremely colorful cast of supporting characters. One of my favorites is a a science ship who talks like Carl Sagan. Fittingly enough, his name is UHS Sagan. I also liked the spaceship who collaborates with Will to create a new form of cryptocurrency. I’d comment on how stupid that is, but Will seems like the kind of spaceship who would go for that sort of thing. The annual Mars Rover Race was another really fun episode. I could keep going on, but suffice it to say, you’ll meet several memorable spacecraft throughout season one of Spaceships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe spaceships all run the spectrum from kind and sympathetic to petty, scheming, and even evil. But overall, the spaceships come across as flawed, often deeply so, but well meaning. In other words, though they are machines, they’re human in all the ways that count. I suppose it is of some comfort to think that, though the curtain has fallen on the human race, a certain spark of the human spirit lives on in the machines we built. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must also give some serious praise for how the season one finale was handled. But if I’m going to do that, we’re going to have to get into spoilers. So, if you don’t want any of that, turn back now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast chance, you sure you want to continue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf everyone who wants out is gone, let’s get into it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, as I previously noted, Maya really liked humans. However, there was one human she was particularly fond of. He was a brilliant scientist, and they grew very close with one another. In fact, you could say they fell in love with each other. But, he wasn’t the only human who caught her eye. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a second human scientist who Maya greatly admired, but not in a romantic way. This scientist, while brilliant, was also a major misanthrope, and grew increasingly cynical over the years. He also went a tad nutty as well. Eventually, he developed a formula intended to destroy all artificial intelligences. Unfortunately, he did that math wrong, and it killed all organic intelligences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA mathematics formula that can cause human minds to shut down? Might be more plausible than you might think. Some scientists have theorized that it is possible to make a human mind crash like a computer program. Perhaps their might be some pattern that the human brain is incapable of processing, and this could trigger a systems failure of the mind. Neil Stephenson famously utilized this idea in his novel Snow Crash. Thankfully, this remains a hypothetical scenario, and might not even be possible at all. On the other hand, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the human mind. So, you never know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis revelation occurs in the penultimate episode of season one. It is also in this episode that Maya dies while retrieving this information. That is to say, damaged beyond the point of repair. I kept wondering if this was going to stick. It has been shown that spaceships can have their AIs downloaded into other bodies. But no, Maya stayed dead by the end of the season. I must applaud Filip Momirovski for being willing to stick to his guns. Having Maya stay dead was a choice that could easily have upset people, but I’m glad Filip didn’t take the easy way out. But let’s see what season two holds for us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, here’s a thought, what if organics aren’t gone for good? The International Space Station has something called The Immorality Drive. It is a memory storage device that contains the digitized genetic codes of several famous humans, such as Stephen Hawking, Stephen Colbert, and Lance Armstrong. Obviously, it was created before Lance Armstrong got busted for doping. Anyway, the Immortality Drive is there in hope that, should humanity go extinct, and alien race might be able to resurrect humanity. I’m willing to bet that the future of Spaceships has several such Immortality Drives. Perhaps the spaceships will discover some Immortality Drives, and will debate if it is worth resurrecting humanity and the other races of the galaxy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut whatever the future of Spaceship holds, I do know one thing for certain. I can’t wait to see what season two will have in store for us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, there you have it. Spaceships is a dramedy about sentient spaceships exploring the galaxy in the aftermath of humanity’s sudden demise. It has extremely high production values, great voice acting, and quality writing. You certainly won’t want to miss out on this audio drama. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink to the original review on my blog: [https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2022/11/the-audio-file-spaceships.html?m=1](https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2022/11/the-audio-file-spaceships.html?m=1)",

        "text": "Ghosts are usually described as apparitions, that you can't touch it because they have no physical body, and (sometimes) they can interact with things around, even humans (like evil ghosts that hurt, or loud ghosts that mess with objects), but even so, people can't interact with them no matter what. You can't touch them, but they can touch you. \n\nWondering about this, the only one explanation I could think of this, in a Scientific way, would be: they're electromagnetic waves. Radiation, depending on the level, can be harmful to humans, and have different and specific reactions to some objects, due to their chemical reaction with certain elements that contain in the object. It's like a sunburn, you can't touch the heat waves, but they can interact with things. Some types of rays may or may not \"walk\" through objects like wall, like Gamma Rays may pass through, but Average Light can't. \n\nThinking about this, one could get to the conclusion that Ghosts are some sort of wave that is perceived by the human eyes, and it's properties, like wave length, is enough to make it harmful (if it's an evil ghost) and able to go through walls. Definitely, there would be a material, maybe lead, that can be used to capture it, like in a lead box, or some sort of machine that can absorb it, like those things that can catch ghosts as if they were Pokémon, or just bugs in a net.",

        "text": "&gt;**O**f all the foul, villainous, violent and frankly *lunatic* men who served aboard the myriad mercenary, merchant and pirate ships that sailed the burning sea, none were so dreaded nor relied upon as the beasts they called the *hammerjacks*.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;While mighty warships might be sunk by a single torpedo, while the smallest of cracks in the greatest of hulls might incinerate a crew in an instant, that crew would gladly burn before they’d face the fury of the hammerjack. For the hammerjack went first. That is what they said; that is what they said with dreadful pride and morbid glee. It was instruction, it was warning; it was statement of fact, preserved in folk song and legend:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*First goes the hammerjack!*  \n*First into the fray!*  \n*First unto the breach;*  \n*For the breach was made by the hammerjack,*  \n*And the hammerjack owns it!*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The tools of the trade varied, from Jack to Jack and ship to ship. Some used “controlled” explosions. Others used machines with diamond teeth. Some, in moments of lunacy, even tried to use an actual hammer... though their careers, against all odds, managed to be shorter than any of their peers.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The point was; when boarding a vessel, someone had to open the door. Or create one. And once opened, a door had to be entered, lest an enemy slam it shut. So it was that a certain type of man, gifted with an unholy combination of ingenuity and savagery, gravitated towards the unofficial yet universal position of *hammerjack.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;And that was perhaps the oddest thing of all; that they invariably volunteered. Perhaps they were born of mankind’s crippling fear of awkward silences; merely stepping forward to get it over with. Perhaps they were addicted to the thrill of uncertainty; the gamble associated with any boarding action. Perhaps they bore some terrible sense of responsibility for their brethren, or were seeking atonement for grisly sins.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where Lefty Todd was concerned, it was anyone’s guess, and may have been all of the above.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘Lefty, no.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘Sir?’   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘The *grenade*. No.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘No grenade, sir?’   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘No grenade, Lefty. Captain’s orders.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘...Aye aye, sir,’ said the man rather dejectedly; the S whistling through his missing front tooth. The pistol was more than enough. In fact, it was probably overkill, given that Redfast knew *exactly* how Lefty Todd had lost that tooth... and where it still remained, to this day, embedded in bone.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anywhere else, Lefty would be dead, or serving life aboard a prison hulk for various violent and indecent acts. Anywhere else, the man would be a menace, a tragedy, or both. But life at sea was different. Different rules for a different game. Out here, what mattered was that Lefty followed orders, and that his inherent savagery was directed by a greater cause. The cause itself didn’t matter; he could just as easily have been hammerjacking for the pirates, and blasting open airlocks with murderous intent. In fact, his fury would have been admired and highly valued by the clans. But fate had led him to the Aerendra instead, and aboard the Aerendra, he would follow orders even if those orders killed him.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;For every living sailor understood the importance of the chain of command; that it pulled both ways, and kept everyone alive; that if one man failed to do his duty in swabbing the deck... another might just as easily fail to do his duty in replacing the filters in the atmospheric processors, and leave everyone choking on their own carbon dioxide. You did what you were told to do, not because you believed it was right, and not because you understood *why,* but because you knew it was necessary.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, from Redfast’s perspective, what was right *was* necessary.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘This isn’t a good idea, you know,’ Langhurst observed, watching the men prepare with a critical eye.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘It is our sworn duty,’ Redfast replied. ‘Or had you forgotten that?’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Do you want me to quote the actual wording of the oath? There’s nothing in it about snatching ships from the clutches of Mars, I assure you. In fact, I dare say that if the original signatories of the oath were here, they’d consider this an exception.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘You’re worried about me. I’m touched.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Langhurst rolled his eyes. ‘Since Monday, I’ve found that you’re a good source of income.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘We’ll see about that.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Assuming you survive...’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Don’t you worry, sir!’ proclaimed Lefty Todd, grinning his gappy grin and sliding a disconcertingly large knife into a scabbard on his chest with practised precision. ‘Anyone tries to hurt our lieutenant here, I’ll make ‘em *smile.*’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;To anyone else, this might have sounded like a joke or an empty threat. But Redfast knew from personal experience; that just as he felt a binding responsibility to lead Lefty Todd to the best of his ability, Lefty Todd felt a binding responsibility to brutally disfigure anyone who threatened his commanding officer...   \n&gt;  \n&gt;...Even if that officer happened to be someone like Gregory Langhurst, who cringed at Lefty’s promise but nevertheless felt obliged to respond with, ‘I’m sure you will, Mister Todd. Good man.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The intercom buzzed.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Control. Lock confirmed on our end; you may proceed at your convenience.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Quarterdeck acknowledges,’ Langhurst replied, then turned to Redfast and nodded. ‘Ready when you are.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The red light turned green, the door was hauled open, and into the airlock went Lefty Todd without hesitation; hauling a tower-shield he’d made from a piece of hull taken from the ship itself during a drydock repair. It still bore the scorch-marks of combat, and was now adorned with a huge grinning face painted in bone-white, with mad eyes and vicious teeth.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pete Whistler followed, his tool belts clinking and clattering, with Ulfr Kebb in close pursuit, already wearing his lucky gas mask over his once-unlucky scarred face, and wielding a hatchet, just in case. Checking that nobody had dropped anything, Redfast stepped over the threshold and turned around. As the airlock door was closed, he fixed his eyes upon the far side of the quarterdeck; upon a plaque screwed to the inner hull. Above it, the name of the ship was painted in huge white letters stretching from one side of the quarterdeck compartment to the other, but the plaque was what everyone noticed first. Shield-shaped and golden, it bore the heraldry of Firesend; an all-seeing eye above an open book. The following words were etched into the metal in the middle of the book:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;SWORN, WITNESSED AND RECORDED  \nTHIS VESSEL AND ALL WHO SERVE ABOARD HER   \nARE BOUND AND PROTECTED BY THE FIRESEND OATH.   \nHE WHO WOULD HARM US WOULD HARM HER,   \nHE WHO WOULD HARM HER WOULD HARM US ALL,   \nTHAT NONE STAND ALONE.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IN HEAVEN SHALL OUR DEEDS BE JUDGED,  \nIN FIRE SHALL MAN REPENT.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, Redfast checked that his gun was loaded, then holstered it firmly. The inner door slammed shut; a familiar hissing arose, accompanied by the popping of ears.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘One eye on the clock, gentlemen,’ he advised the others. ‘Twenty minutes. In and out like she charges by the minute.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a murmured chuckle and acknowledgement. As mechanisms unseen rumbled, the four-man team eyed the outer door with suspicion... and awaited the possible violence to come. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijv5gsdi8maa1.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=979c2a8c139d115280fae64417fc43ca1881cc22",
