        "text": "My understanding is that punishments in the Jewish Bible, with the exception of those relating to specific religious practices, often resemble those in the Code of Hammurabi and Middle Assyrian Laws, or represent an evolution from them. Is this correct?\n\nThere are many examples of punishments involving fines, exile, indentured servitude, and death, and even a system of due process, but little is mentioned on incarceration. Probably because it didn't really exist. What are some good sources analyzing these and other ancient legal systems from a critical social scientific perspective? It'd be also nice if the source was open to layman and made comparisons to the modern day, or discussed how legal systems changed over time (a textbook is okay!).\n\nEDIT, for clarification:\n\nI'm wondering (i) how the lack of the institution of incarceration affected the degree and severity of punishments and (ii) what socio-political reasons were given for the creation of the laws of that time. For example, the Code of Hammurabi applied a system of fines for murder cases and capital punishments for certain property violations, like freeing a slave. This code has a class system, with separate punishments. Families sometimes have leeway in determining the punishment, and families are sometimes targeted for punishment (if an owner's ox kills a child, the owner's child may be killed)\n\nThe Hebrew Bible reverses this to some extent, and the only significant class distinction is with regards to ritual purity among the priestly classes. The literal eye-for-eye justice is relaxed. Why is this? What socio-political differences caused this shift? ",

Meaning this new discovery adds about 100'000 years of uncharted history to an already obscure field. It is obvious that this new discovery is very important. \n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1: According to the majority of the scientific community 'The Dawn of Civilization' seems to base itself somewhere in the past 8000-6000~ years (Mesopotamia, Egypt). \nConsidering Homo Sapiens have existed far longer, does that mean cognitively modern Humans have existed for 292'000~ wandering the planet? \n\n2: How different from contemporary humans would the earliest Sapiens specimens be?  Plato's Allegory of the Cave springs to my mind: Did they share the same potential for intelligent behavior as us, or was this developed later?\n\n3: If the consensus on the subject of human development remains the same, it would suggest humanity spent 292'000 years wandering around, avoiding anything bigger than every-day farm animals, before suddenly around 8000 years ago settling down in multiple regions (That we know of) and establishing some of History's most influential civilizations. All of which appear nearly simultaneously and develop extremely complicated skills, such as writing, societal institutions, and advanced stone-masonry. \nAre there any plausible theories/explanations as to how this fascinating development might have occurred? \n\n\n\nI don't expect to find the answer to all my questions, but it would be interesting to see if there are opinions on the matter. \n\nThanks!\n\n\n",

I have spent the past 8 years in school (from undergrad to grad) doing EE. However, I was sorta forced into EE by my parents, but I learned to like it. Just yesterday, I had an epiphany that I really don't see myself as an engineer because I know it's going to be unfulfilling to me in the long run. I don't care about the latest trends in technology and that's not the first thing that pops into my head when I wake up in the morning. I don't like any of the huge tech companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc) either because I feel they're perpetuating a Brave-New-World-esque technology addiction among people today. So, with the help of my gf, I did one of those \"Career Questionnaires\" online last night and found that some of the fields I am most interested in are Anthropology and Philosophy. I have always loved reading about linguistics and philosophy since high school and have only been hindered in learning more in these two fields because I had to study for my engineering courses. Now, my question to you is - where can I start with Anthropology (specifically Linguistic Anthropology)? And what are some prospects of Anthropology?\n\nTL;DR: Electrical Engineer doesn't like Electrical Engineering cuz it's not going to be fulfilling. Likes Anthropology and Philosophy instead.

So in order to get myself \"presentable\" to the grad school admission board and to figure out what topics I'm genuinely interested in, I've been reading some articles for awhile.\n\nSo far I read: (Allison, 1991 - Japanese Mothers and Obentos), (Noguchi, 1994 - Savor Slowly: Ekiben), (Holtzman, 2006 - Food and Memory), (Mintz &amp; Du Bois, 2002 - The Anthropology of Food and Eating), (Appadurai, 1988 - How to Make a National Cuisine, Cookbooks in Contemporary India), (Theodore Bestor, 2001 - Supply-Side Sushi: Commodity, Market, and Global City) (Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney, 1995 - Structure, Event and Historical Metaphor: Rice and Identities in Japanese History.)\n\nRight now I'm reading Sweetness and Power by Sidney W. Mintz. And of course, I'm gonna keep reading more articles and books.\nTLDR: What other things can I do more in order to be competent applicant for a grad school in USA? Since I'm a psych BA, I have a feeling that I have to work more than other anthropology BAs. Also, can you recommend me some more authors/ professors who's really prominent in (Japanese) food culture?\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "I've been reading up on Maori culture in anticipation of a trip to New Zealand. Ta moko is the traditional Maori practice of tattooing. The designs in the tattoos carry meanings about the person's iwi (tribe) and serve as unique identifying information. Traditionally they were carved into a person's skull so that person could be identified by their tattoos even after death.\n\nOf course, since the first Europeans arrived in New Zealand some have been appropriating ta moko, and today Maori tattoos are still popular among pakeha (non-Maori kiwis) and tourists. I was surprised to learn that in recent years some Maori tattoo artists have begun to make a distinction between ta moko and what they have named kirituhi. Ta moko have specific cultural meanings and can only be worn by a Maori; kirituhi are inspired by Maori style but do not carry the same cultural meaning. Both are usually designed by the tattoo artist specifically for the recipient, and are often done freehand.\n\nThis brings me to my question, which is a subquestion under the larger question of where the line is between appreciating another culture respectfully, and appropriation. Do you think distinctions like the one between ta moko and kirituhi are a good long-term solution to the damage done by cultural appropriation, or do you think it only perpetuates the underlying problem of appropriation, that white people behave as if they are entitled to everyone else's cultures? I'd be especially interested to learn how other indigenous peoples besides Maori approach this issue.\n\nFor more context, here's the article by a Maori tattoo artist that started me thinking about this: http://www.tarynberi.com/blog/2015/4/10/the-difference-between-kirituhi-and-moko\n\nTL;DR: When indigenous people accommodate white peoples' desire to appropriate by making cultural items specifically intended for white people, do you think that helps solve or perpetuate the underlying problem?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the earnest and thoughtful comments! I know there's no right or wrong answer to this, I was just wondering about different people's takes on it.",

I also picked up a book at the gift shop titled \"Farmers In Prehistoric Britain\" by Francis Pryor and read that \"the ways of life of the earliest Neolithic farmers in southern Britain and that of their hunter-gather-fisher contemporaries were not grossly dissimilar.\"  I began to wonder if a society that farmed but didn't display *any* other typical features of horticultural life could still be considered Neolithic.  Does a quasi-agricultural culture *really* still count?\n  Could someone please explain how this makes sense and/or correct me on any of my observations about prehistoric Britain (particularly pertaining to Avebury)?",

I can see this going either way but I figured it's better to ask than not to ask. Also I hope this is the right place to ask, after reading the FAQ in /r/askhistorians I think it's better to ask here.\n\nHow did humans discover tubers and root vegetables as food? \n\nPossible things I can imagine, but I have no knowledge so this is just my imagination...\n\n- Did they observe animals that eat these and try it out for themselves? \nI can imagine that learning what prey animals eat would be useful for hunters. Perhaps they also tried eating what the animals eat? I know that boars for example dig for food. \n\n- Was it trial-and-error born from desperation? \nThis feels unlikely to me. \n\n\n- Maybe they observed plants and tried to figure out how they worked and the function of all parts. Then decided that maybe the plants store \"energy\" in the roots, meaning they'd be good food. Or perhaps since they knew nuts/seeds were edible, and probably knew the life cycle of plants, they figured that what's underground must carry energy post growth?\n\nPerhaps they didn't think about energy as we do these days, but I think they'd be smart enough to realize that some parts of organisms matter more than others when it comes to the organism staying alive. And could figure out what to eat from there. Or what parts stored the most \"energy.\" \n\n\n\nJust to be clear I'm not asking why people domesticated these plants, or where they discovered the edible tubers and root vegetables. Not even when. Just how.\n\nI'm not good at using Google to its full potential, but all I can find is when I pair \"discover\" with \"tubers\" or such, I get things like gene discoveries etc. \n\n\n\nThanks in advance.

Extrapolating slightly for brevity purposes, I'd describe the theory as thus:\n\n'the primary root of Roman military superiority was the simple fact that they had more soldiers. Consistently, in war after war they fought, even when they lost key battles they would win wars by being able to replace fallen soldiers where other nations could not. \nTo maintain the population of Rome, every fertile woman would have had to have had at least nine children in her life, probably more. Roman women could therefore do literally nothing else in life but marry at thirteen and reproduce until menopause. They became a means of production necessary to the survival of the Roman Empire. Therefore, misogyny played a vital societal function.'\n\nThis would seem to make sense. After the development of agriculture the communities that dominated militarily are those that were intrinsically misogynistic. \n\nIs this the accepted anthropological theory? Or is there another idea that better explains just why the vast majority of societies in antiquity were so misogynistic? ",
