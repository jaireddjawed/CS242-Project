        "text": "My current WiFi service is listed as a 'Public' connection. Located in a large apartment complex. There's a password protected authentication portal. I believe the likes of dorms &amp; hotels have similar setups.\n\nMy concern is the security of the connection (the password is plastered everywhere, for starters), alongside the lack of privacy.\n\nI will not be torrenting or partaking in anything that I'd be concerned with a VPN service keeping logs of (despite this, I'll still be using a reputable company). My goals are to be able to obfuscate my traffic, so that I can privately browse with peace of mind. Having a secure connection is also paramount, so that I can use online banking and trade crypto.\n\nIs this possible with a VPN alone?\n\nAny tips are greatly appreciated. I run Win7 &amp; Android.\n\nI'm also really curious what information/logs the likes of these internet providers keep. Many thanks.",

It will be an intensive, 12 weeks \n course. It will take you from a very beginner stage and teach you red teaming concepts, attacks and techniques followed by 4 weeks of training solely on security perspective. \n\n[Click here for the course curriculum](https://rootsh3ll.com/wireless-security-video-course/)\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\nYou'll be finding threats, anomalies, IoA and IoCs, reporting, detecting rogue devices and writing custom tools/scripts for attack and defense.\n\n**About Cloud Labs and CTFs**\n\nI am also preparing for cloud-based labs for the training. Imagine it like OSCP or HackTheBox styled learning labs for training and CTFs both. If you are skeptic about the WiFi sniffing (not traditional cracking, actual 802.11 sniffing) in the cloud here is the proof-of-concept that I recently published for my research paper: https://youtu.be/ZLCShLxFhM8\n\n\nI have opened the course for pre-order. This would allow me to talk closely to a group of people (&lt;100) and gather data/suggestions for improving the quality of the course and the CTFs before launch (August 7th)\n\n**What you would get?**\n\n1. Videos\n2. PDF and Text files\n3. Forum Support\n4. Access to Cloud labs for Experiment\n5. Wireless CTF Labs\n6. Weekly LIVE Doubt clearing Sessions\n\n**Course description:** \n\nLink: https://rootsh3ll.com/wireless-security-video-course/\n\n**Queries**\n\nYou can clear any query here/PM or via email (harry@rootsh3ll.com)\n\n**Pricing**\nEnrolment for early birds is $99. and after the official launch(august 7) price will be doubled to $197. Both of them will include Exclusive CTFs and labs. Early birds gets the most out of it though. \n\nIf you find this course and concept of cloud labs really interesting but still didn’t pre order, would you mind to share a few things that could help me save countless hours and stress. \n1. What was the bottle neck that stopped you to pre order?\n2. What could be done to make it better / what was missing IYO?\n\nAnswers to these 2 simple questions can help me showcase the course and myself in a better way while saving many many hours. Your support and help is most welcomed !\n\n**Orginal Reddit Thread Here**: https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/8p0ohj/wifi_hacking_in_the_cloud_oscp_like_course_and/\n\n**Course Description Link**: https://rootsh3ll.com/wireless-security-video-course/\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8pvzpy/insecurities_in_application_based_port/",
        "text": "I'm considering writing a port multiplexer like that of [sslh](https://github.com/yrutschle/sslh). I'll outline the basic idea, and I hope you will help me find the\ncaveats in the design.\n\nThe program, called portmuxd, will be a daemon that will run on a server. A separate program, such as stunnel, will use the open\nport 443 on the server. After decrypting incoming tls packets, stunnel forwards the packets to the local port that portmuxd is listening\nto. portmuxd will parse the now unencrypted packets and forward them to localhost:80 if they are http packets, forward them to localhost:22 if\nthey are ssh packets, etc. Any packets that portmuxd cannot identify will be dropped.\n\n\nDiagram: https://i.imgur.com/9DlhO8e.png\n\nHere is a list of security concerns:\n\n        - Q. How does the user lock down access to ssh?\n          A. Because stunnel is running on server:443, the user has to encrypt his ssh traffic with tls. \n              This would appear to be privacy through obfuscation, but it does stop bots from scanning for sshd on server:443.\n\n        - Q. What if an attacker/pen tester gets smart and encrypts his ssh traffic with tls and tries to connect to server:443?\n          A. Set up portmuxd to respond to a magic packet. After recieving this packet with a predefined token, portmuxd will \n               forward ssh packets from the user's ipaddress to the server's localhost:22 for an x amount of time. \n               (Bonus: use a one time pad to generate the token.)\n\n        - Q. Why use stunnel or some other tls wrapper/unwrapper in front of portmuxd anyway?\n          A. This should fool some firewalls that try to block ssh packects (or log ssh activity) regardless of what port they \n               are going to.\n\n        - Q. Won't some firewalls be able to tell that the tunnelled packets look funny? Would protocol obfuscation be of any\n             help?\n          A. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (Suggestions?)\n\n        - Q. Will portmuxd support protocols other than ssh and http?\n          A. Eventually. I'll see about having profiles that allow for easy expansion of\n             protocol support.\n\n        - Q. This sounds like a really cool idea, but it only looks to be used and messed with by some in the hacker community.\n             Why is that? Is it impractical or somehow insecure?\n          A. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n\nAny suggestions or blaring problems that I have missed? If so, constructive criticism would be wonderful.\n\nEDIT: formatting \n",

        "title": "Leave my job to work as a pen tester for 2/3 of my current pay?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8ppvqo/leave_my_job_to_work_as_a_pen_tester_for_23_of_my/",
        "text": "Hi Reddit. I would love to get your feedback. I've been working in IT for 11 years. Until recently, I've always worked as a project engineer for VARs. I started as a network engineer and then I learned infrastructure systems (e.g.: virtualization, storage, email, directory services, file/print, etc). I've worked with some talented colleagues and I've always been a fast learner. For the last few years, I've had a special focus on security. I also have some sales chops... Not like an obnoxious used-car salesmen, but more like a trusted technology architect/adviser. I've been in the right places at the right times, and I've put in the effort needed to climb up the career ladder. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI recently started a new contractor job as an in-house security consultant. I've never been in-house before. It's only been a month, but so far I like this much better than working on projects all over the place. I'm working as an hourly contractor, which is another first for me. As a result, I'm earning more money than I've ever earned. I'm comfortable in this environment. My manager spends big $$$ on safeguards, so our defenses are strong. I'm getting great exposure to a talented development team and a cloud-centric infrastructure (along with the unique challenges that come with a cloud-centric infrastructure). I'm very fond of my manager and my colleagues. The gig is relatively close to home, 20 miles away (about 30-60 min one-way drive). This is an on-site gig, no remote work. The work is compelling and I have lots of downtime for studying and ---whatever.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPrior to starting this job, I interviewed for a pen testing position. It was a grueling experience. An initial phone interview with a technical manager followed by a web app pentest challenge. The challenge is 24 hours to test a web app and then another 24 hours to write a report. If you find enough issues and your report is good enough, you're invited in for a ~3hr technical interview with multiple people (some rock stars). This was a mental endurance challenge and attitude test as much as it was a technical interview. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI was exposed to very limited pen testing at previous jobs. I've done pen testing as a hobby and I have a lab at home where I run some goodies. I'm not a great pentester and I'm not a great developer, be it web app or bash scripting or whatever. To make a long story short, I received an offer to come onboard with this organization as a pen tester. They're willing to train me and help me build up my pen testing skills. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe downside is the pay is 2/3 of my current salary. It's a BIG jump. I would also need to commute into xyz metropolis, which is 40 miles from home (a 70-min one-way train ride **best case scenario**). Realistically, the commute would be brutal and expensive. On the plus side, I can work remotely a few days a week once I get acclimated with the environment. There are bonus programs to supplement the salary. One of the bonus programs is based on utilization. Utilization = billable project hours = highly structured environment =  saddle up the workhorse. Historically I haven't fared well in highly structured environments. I usually end up leaving within a few months. Even if I hit the bonuses I still won't earn what I'm earning today. This place is founded by former FBI personnel and I don't know if I will pass their background check. I had some dumb run-ins when I was in my late teens and early 20s. No fraud or computer crimes or anything violent, but a few embarrassing petty incidents. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI could swing the lower salary, although it stinks going backwards in pay for the first time in my life. Commuting is also going to be a doozy. I can man up and do it, but it's not going to be an easy transition. I'm going to be miserable... and I'm going to have to bust my hump to ramp up and get over the learning curve. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAre there any pen testers here? What do you love and hate about your job? Do you think I should leave my comfy, highly paid, in-house, close-to-home job to go commute for hours a day? What do you think about training from a top-notch organization?  What are your experiences with compensation and organization structure (e.g.: utilization, etc) ?  This seems like a good opportunity, but at a high price. Is learning to pen test + the work experience worth the pay cut? What would you do?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Anon \n(J0hnny-Yen(again))",

I'm curious if this sub can recommend any fun projects or tasks that will help me become more familiar with the netsec/InfoSec environment. To disclose a little about myself, I would actually consider myself more of programmer than security, so a lot of my knowledge about computers is centered around program/software development (mostly in C#, but also java and C\\+\\+). Ideally, I'm looking for programming projects that could be useful to my employer. We are a pretty big company and we already have all the essentials such as web/email filtering, VMs, databases, threat monitoring, etc. I really like this internship, but this past week I haven't been given a single assignment and I've been left to just \"do my own thing,\" and I feel like I'm just not learning. Do you guys have any suggestions for projects or even program that I should try to get more familiar with? I recently installed Wireshark to learn more about network protocols and packets, and it's going well actually but I can't do this the entire summer. Some tools currently at my disposal are Trend Micro suit (DDI, DDAN, anti\\-virus), Wireshark, and Visual Studio. Our company also has Cisco Umbrella, Barracuda, Varonis, and Azure, but I haven't been allowed access to those yet.",

Although I have been a Network Engineer for about 8-9 years, I really want to transition to information security. I believe that I can use my IT networking background and US Army background as an incident response analyst or network forensics analyst. I have signed up for a couple 3-month online courses pertaining to cyber security.\nMy company does have an information security team but they are located in an office outside of my area which will close soon so the future of that team is in flux at this time. They will also stay outside my area regardless of their determined future.\nMy concern is that I feel that I would be looked upon negatively as a job hopper by taking a Network Engineer position than pursuing an InfoSec position in less than 6 months but I want to follow what I want to do.\nDoes anybody have any advice on how should I go about this career crossroad?

Will the questions be more conceptual (think Dan Miessler) or about pentesting tools and scenarios? I'm nervous because I've taken the OSCP  and didn't pass around 8 months ago, which I think will impede my chances. Are interviewers generally more concerned with your existing knowledge or are they a bit more forgiving for internship positions? Thanks all!  \n\nUPDATE: I ended up getting the internship! Thank you guys very much for your input; for my interview, the questions were a mix of how I tackled my OSCP boxes and technical knowledge. For the latter, /u/subsonic68 's GitHub link was invaluable. I can't stress how comprehensive it is, and is 100% worth your time to go through. In general, all of the comments are very useful in concepts that you'd want to brush up on. \nI hope this thread is useful for other internship seekers, and if you'd like to know more about my interview, please feel free to PM me or comment :) Again, thanks a lot you guys, I hope to learn a lot from my experience and share it back with the community!",
