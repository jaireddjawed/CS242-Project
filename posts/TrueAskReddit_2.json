There are periods of time in which my hands do not physically look like my hands.\nI can feel them.\nThey do not move on their own.\nEverything else in life is normal. \n\nLike most people I usually recognize my hands. Everyone knows the appearance of their own limbs; however, I go through prolonged periods in which my hands look bigger than usual. In reality I am sure they are the same size but my skin looks strange, the wrinkles in my hands are different, and the proportion of my palm to my fingers has changed. \n\nI have tried to find an answer to this strange visual perception but I cannot find any answers. If anyone experiences this or has any information I would love to hear about it.\n\nI have no diagnosed mental disorders or any medical issues really. Perhaps my hands have actually changed and I simply need to readjust my self perception.",

I found an abnormal loss in a certain country. 7 individuals are responsible for its majority. I have come up with a recommendation of reviewing their contracts and consider blacklisting them if ever it is proven that they are exploiting the company, review the terms of agreement of their contract and update it to avoid future exploitations, consider reviewing laws for the countries they are operating in.  \nI would like to know if there are better and more effective solutions to what Ive come up with as I am very inexperienced in this field. Any ideas will be appreciated.  \nThe company specializes in providing marketing services to other companies. They help mid-sized companies launch their marketing operations, which includes things like email marketing, website development, content creation, and others.\n\nThank you for those that will answer.",

(inappropriate relationship with a relatively passive adult)\n\nWhat has failed so far:  \n(pronouns: she/her)\n\n* It will hurt her in the long run, and most likely right away too.\n* She'll feel 'used' by that adult person--in power by definition--and will regret it.\n* Not matter the circumstances, the adult is responsible, so that adult is at least suspicious, if not creepy, guilty, criminal (depending how far that person allow things to progress.)\n* This is forbidden.\n* This is illegal (partly, depending on her goal)\n* This would bring huge troubles for that person (administrative and legal troubles.)\n* Their minds are not in the same stage and can't align, no matter how much she romanticizes the situation.\n* The power imbalance will make this relationship deeply flawed and fundamentally asymmetric.\n* She's being manipulated (well, circumstances make this one unlikely at first, but still...)\n\nOf course, I skipped all the moralizing point of views that would have only added fuel to the fire. (you might also skip those, so we can focus on what's effective, as the 'taboo repellent' isn't working) And even if there's no sex involved, this doesn't change much the question I think, since there's a limit not to cross before that.\n\nI can understand that the forbidden/illegal message doesn't get through because sometimes young people like to take the risk, think they'll get away with it (by being smarter and by hiding well), and furthermore, in this case, the trouble won't be for them but for the adult.\n\nWhat's tricky is to make young people understand the mental thing, because this is something one fully realizes only once adult. It takes time to mature and to have the capacity to step back and distance oneself from emotions, the first aspect. And it also takes some time to acquire this sort of mental stability and resistance to influence that characterizes the fully grown adult in early twenties, the second aspect. And those two aspects are needed to grasp a big part of what's problematic in such relationship. (*I'm not a psy specialist so I worded this the best I could, I hope you get it*)\n\nSo, how can someone envision this when their brain is not yet 'fully equipped'? (*no offense to young people, see above, I mean the psyche is not yet completely built, it's immature*)\n\nHave you heard of some successful discussion that would enlighten the young one to make her stop? (*the other option, dealing with the adult, when known, won't be enough as they can be 'replaced'*)\n\nThanks for your opinion and any pointers!",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I'm totally confused. I have no idea what to do after my undergraduate.\n\nI'm majoring in math and economics and have taken data related electives. I don't know what to do my MS in. \n\nI like math/programming/data visualization and analytics but I'm not an expert in it. I want to become a professor cause I do help my friends with math (and even econ related questions) and they do understand me. But since im not an expert I'm afraid that I might not be able to answer my students questions and that'd be embarrassing. Plus, sometimes I do get A/A-s in advanced math courses but then I think it's because those instructors give questions similar to book and what they taught. So, maybe I won't be able to answer my students conceptual questions.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of economics and math seems daunting (ig). And I'm not sure if I should change my field to data science/programming/CS. Cause what if I don't succeed? Plus some people are saying changing fields is not a good option. \n\n\nI'm confused. I am kind of introverted and a super quite person so I know for sure that corporate jobs are not for me. I'd rather spend my time studying (to teach students) or do remote programming jobs. \n\nSorry if I sound dumb. Maybe, I can't do anything in life.\n\nCan anyone please guide me? I'm completely lost and I don't think I want to do a PhD in economics (which my parents are suggesting me to do).\n\n\nThank you.",

Your family and friends will die off one by one and you’ll never see them again, you won’t even be able to go to the funeral, soon you’ll be just a memory. A name called out by guards and recorded in prison logs. Until finally you die in your cell. You’ll never get out and your appeals will go nowhere after you conviction. \n\nWith the death penalty it’s obvious. You die in the chair. But struggle to see why I should be disgusted by the date executing a serial rapist when I wouldn’t give two shits if he died in his sleep in his cell. \n\nWhat are we supposed to object to?

So I have a lot of different topics I have been tackling. Here are some examples:\n\n* Books on history/politics of the country I live in because I recently moved here;\n* Daily news podcasts because I'm a political analphabet and want to understand what's going on both in my native country and in my current one;\n* Magazines on current, especially local themes in my professional area, because I'm about to finish my masters in a foreign country and am not prepared for work life here in the slightest.\n\nI have REALLY been wondering how to balance all of that. The way I do it at the moment is manageable, if a little hectic. Podcasts while I get ready for my internship and during my commute, books on the way back and on the free time at home interchanged with magazines. It's a bit tiring because in my field we already read a lot, but I have a naturally frenetic mind, so it's not much of a problem.\n\nIt's just I have no time or energy for content on my personal interests. And recently I have discovered another really interesting magazine I want to subscribe to, but this one has monthly issues (my other ones are all released quarterly).\n\nIt's a lot of information. Surely there is a way through this?!",

(My parents are pretty unsuccessful, I have too much debt to pay someone to listen right now because of enormous emergency expenses in Dec, and i'm not friends with people motivated/hard-working/intelligent/interested enough to help me with this sort of thing.) Although I already believe college was a scam i had little choice but to participate in, my mental faculties probably being impaired by a physical condition I’m going to actually be treated for soon, and simply being unintelligent in many respects are making rethink almost everything. So I have some some general questions I don't want specific answers to, they're more to help you understand my frame of mind. \n\nHow is a person I know able to own a house by owning a bike shop? How is my only online friend, who has a master's degree, able to build up a nest egg with which to continue owning a house  without having worked in about a year? How is another person I know able to own a medium size house in a major city only by producing music? If I want to ever make more than $50,000 a year (basically the max with my bachelor of science and as much experience as I have), and given that I flatly cannot comprehend the logic needed to read an LSAT prep book (and have tried), something I’ve been mulling over for a while, how am I supposed to start and run a business on my own? At this point the questions stop being unanswerable.\n\nAm I being pessimistic to say I've been wearing horse blinders my whole life? It feels like I know less than 20% of what the rest of the country does about making money.\n\nI just...I don't know what I don't know. I know people don’t want to actively help others even to understand. This is me asking for help, knowing many people 10 years younger than me understand the world much better than I do. If you had to guess and say something, anything that would help me understand anything about the common thread behind my questions...what would it be?",

        "text": "I can feel cold on my skin. But beyond a certain point it starts to become more like pain. There are different thresholds for different situations. \n\nMy limit for swimming is 15°C. As water approaches 20°C it becomes cool, and then cold. At 15°C it a painful cold, but that fades. So, only getting into the water and getting used to it hurts, but swimming can be enjoyable after that. Below 15°C, the pain is overwhelming. Even if I try to ignore the pain, it seriously diminishes my enjoyment of the experience. The last time I did this, I saw enjoyment of fall foliage around me disappear while I felt that pain.\n\nFor just walking in shallow water, below my knees, I am okay with a few degrees cooler than 15°C. The pain is still intense, but localized, so despite that, it can be an enjoyable experience. The pain does diminish, but it takes several minutes and involves numbness.\n\nIf I wash my hands in cold water, at first that's cold, but it starts turning into pain, which can be very strong.\n\nWith air on my hands the limit is closer to 0°C, but it depends on wind and whether I have extra body heat. (If I'm dressed warmly and/or physically more active, my hands feel warmer.) For my face it is below zero, though again it depends on wind.\n\nDo others experience cold this way? I'm surprised by how people talk about taking cold showers, or go swimming in water that is close to the freezing point. Some people even seem to enjoy swimming in very cold water, which is amazing because I saw how water just under 15°C took away my enjoyment of the experience.\n\nI am also curious if there is some emotional component of this, like that when people are in a better emotional state, cold seems less painful, or less overwhelmingly painful.",

One thing I've already tried is to form a belief of what might happen after death - I personally want to believe in reincarnation, and that everyone comes back to life as their favourite animal (or a human if that's what they wanted). Trouble is, this belief isn't exactly a solid one and more something that I've tried forcing myself into believing to try and overcome this fear - it hasn't worked.\n\nAnother bit of advice I've heard from others is to change your perspective on life and death. When we die, we go back to the exact same state that we were in before we were born - nothingness. No consciousness whatsoever. Without consciousness, there are no feelings of sadness or fear - so why should I fear death if chances are, I won't even know I'm dead? If we want to live on after death, we should do something that people will remember us by long after we're gone. This advice is what I'm wanting to try - the reason I've gone into detail about it is so that it can serve as a written reminder for myself. But at this point, I'm willing to take on any and all advice that people have to give.",

        "text": "In 2007 a team of scientists noticed that 31 people with right-sided hearing loss died suddenly in their sleep. They said that hearing loss is a cause of sudden death during sleep, since the inner ear hair cells - microscopic, sound detecting cells in the middle ear (not to be confused with visible hairs that you can see) - act as respiratory chemoreceptors that stimulate autonomic breathing. They then patented a device which wakes deaf people up if the device detects breathing problems during sleep. The same team of scientists later proved this hypothesis (that hair cells are respiratory chemoreceptors) in experiments on mice, 3 years after creating the patent. After doing these experiments, they said that in humans, damage or loss of these hair cells will cause death from respiratory failure.\n\nWhat about people who are completely deaf then, such as Hellen Keller? She went completely deaf when she was a child and she lived until she was 87 years old.\n\nHow do scientists explain that? And why is any paper talking about hair cells being pivotal for breathing always authored by the same team of scientists? Why aren't other teams of scientists talking about this discovery?\n\nAccording to Oxford Academic, loss of hair cells is the leading cause of hearing loss.",

It's basically the same thing as a woman's right to make choices about her body. If parents shouldn't have the right to make choices about their kids, then why should a woman get to choose? They're really the same issue.\"\n\nNow, I'm not saying those parents should go to jail for bringing their kids to the movie, I just think it was a questionable parenting decision. On to the real issue, one could argue that parents *don't*  have the right to choose everything, and the law recognizes the basic basic human rights of minors- ie when parents choose to beat their kids or punish them with starvation the law steps in. \n\nAn adult woman with all of her cognitive functions is 1) not a child 2) the law and the rest of the country is not her parent. This is a bit extreme, but ending one's life is (I believe) no longer a crime in the US. So how could one argue that they are the same issue? \n\nYou know my stance, I'd appreciate any arguments for, against, or anywhere in between.",

        "text": "I've been reading some motivational pages and I'm fascinated by some of the apparent contradictions I see. To expound on the example in the topic, I've noticed a common theme is not being satisfied with the \"status quo\" life. For example, there's the Reddit favorite Bill Burr quote:\n\n&gt;“Realize that sleeping on a futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing. You know what's worse, sleeping in a king bed next to a wife you're not really in love with but for some reason you married, and you got a couple kids, and you got a job you hate. You'll be laying there fantasizing about sleeping on a futon. There's no risk when you go after a dream. There's a tremendous amount to risk to playing it safe.” \n\nMany quotes and sentiments on motivational blogs and subreddits have a similar negative attitude towards what can be considered \"the standard\" life. Working for some faceless corporation, having a house with a white picket fence, a spouse that kisses you goodbye, 2 kids and a dog named Spot when you come home. The subtext is that there is supposed to be more to life, you're supposed to chase the dream of being the standup comedian, the filmmaker, the artist, the master chef, something like that. And that living that standard life is a squandering of those talents.\n\nHowever, in those same motivational subs and blogs, it's impossible to not notice that posts that get a lot of attention are people who grew up in really disadvantaged situations. People who suffered sexual abuse, physical abuse. Those who were drug addicts. If they post that they made it past all that and got a degree in \"supply chain management\" (just to try to think of a generic job), and live that white picket fence lifestyle, that is seen as a huge win for them.\n\nThat makes me think about the philosophy of motivation, life dreams and advancement. What makes a certain lifestyle pilloried in one context and celebrated in another?\n\nIs there an implication that life is a path through something resembling Maslow's Heirarchy of needs? And accomplishment is about getting to the next level? So if someone grew up in extreme poverty, then just making it to the point where they have a roof over their head and a loving spouse is a big accomplishment. Just as someone who grew up in a middle class family who never had to worry about might have jumped to the \"self actualization\" phase and made their dream of writing come true? Is it the linear advancement through \"getting basic needs\" -&gt; \"being the best version of you\"?\n\nOr could it be the satisfaction of the specific person? If a person grew up with that white picket fence lifestyle from their parents, and emulated it exactly, and is perfectly happy and at ease with it, is that considered an accomplishment? You don't see that case talked about much in the context of these motivational subreddits.\n\nJust some thoughts I had about how society views and celebrates accomplishments. Let me know what you think.",

I know there’s no direct cause and effect to making habitual changes and seeing certain results. I don’t want to get into my life, I’ve tried an enormous amount of treatment, I’m doing slightly below average, but I have nothing fulfilling in my life and have no idea what would be. I would to know whether, if your life has improved in multiple ways over the years, whether you started to WANT to be here, to do things, to get out of bed, to do new things, to see new places, to appreciate the gift of life. Does that change? I’ve been in pain for a long time. I thought I could ask to hear some personal experiences/thoughts/feelings that might help me start to believe my life can get better. (Not interested in bootstraps advice, responsibility is a fact, not a choice. I work and pay bills just like you.) I would really like to hear what people have been feeling before/during/after their lives got better. (I understand progress isn’t a finite range.)",

        "text": "So I have made use of the internet fairly extensively for many years now. One day I began to realize that it is really difficult to get straightforward answers or responses to my posts on very many of the sites and forums I have visited outside of this app. Although I think forums are not as bad as other types of sites in my experience(one example being Quora). The poor responses I am referring to tend to mostly fall into the category of trolling or just B/S. So I have started posting here much more often instead. I have also noticed I am getting a lot of this type of thing IRL from people. Consequently I figured this site might be the best place to ask if anyone else is experiencing this type of thing and why it might be happening, and especially why the IRL issues might be happening to me?
