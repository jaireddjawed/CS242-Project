        "text": "So a few months ago, I was very into spirituality and higher consciousness and all of that stuff. During that specific period of time I would get frequent synchronicities happening to me, I would hear voices talking to me and other strange things. Anyways I used to work in a restaurant as a chef. During service, 'the voice' started messing with me, and it would tell me anything I would ask it in my head; Questions like, when is the world gonna end, things like that. When I asked the voice when I was going to die, the voice confirmed to me, every single time; 55.\n\nAt one point I asked the voice for some kind of proof or confirmation that would actually make me believe what it was telling me in my head, and as soon as the thought came to me, a ticket comes out. \\(tickets telling me customers orders\\)\n\nYou would never guess what table number was written on the ticket that came out. It was table number 55.\n\nAnd just to add a bit of humour to this post, the cause of my death at 55 would eventually be world war 3, the end of the world, caused by nuclear destruction from apparently Trump and North Korea.",

As I was smoking my cigarette, a random man who looked very strange overall comes up to me. I don't remember the whole dialogue, however he first says hi and gives me a smile. He asks me for a cigarette so I roll him one then and there. We are having small talk while I'm rolling, then things start to get strange. He mentions my parents names, mid conversation out of the blue. It takes me a second to gather and process the names I just heard. 'Marisa', 'David'. Now I just start to realise what he has just said; I ask him in shock, 'what did you just say?'. He doesn't say their names again, he just sits there and smiles. \n\nI am in complete disbelief in what is happening at this point; Then this guy starts mumbling other things and I remember hearing him mentioning Jesus.???\n\nAfter that I start to make my way into the station, completely stunned by what just happened, before I leave he starts offering me things like girls, a job, hotel, I don't know what to make of it, so I just leave. \n\nNow this experience was one of the weirdest things to ever happen to me and I'm still wondering how in the hell he knew my parents names. Maybe it was demonic or something divine?\n\nAnother thing to note is that this guy was looking slightly above my head while we were talking at times and he also told me how 'beautiful' I am. \n\nHaven't told many people about this story, my mother doesn't even believe me.",

        "text": "Using a throwaway account so my reddit pals don't think i'm insane. Another note, I am very sceptical when it comes to abnormal/ paranormal things but this event was something else. \n\n\nThis happened not too long ago. I live on a university campus which is not too big but pretty fun to skate from point A to point B. I woke up hungover from a night of drinking and decided to get a bottle of water and some snacks. I took my longboard because I couldn't be bothered walking and I was still a bit woozy. I took the normal path and started skating until something met my eye, I saw someone skating too. There's only a few other skaters around campus so I thought it was cool to see someone else doing the same. I only got a glimpse of them because my campus is full of trees and bushes etc. Then I heard them coming around which is the path I usually take when i'm skating around for fun. As soon as I saw them in detail I was shocked. This person was wearing the clothes I had and skating with the same board. It wasn't the clothes I was wearing at the time but this other me was wearing the same clothes I had at home. I stood there and watched as they skated away and took a detour back around the trees. \n\n\nI didn't believe myself and thought it was cool that someone else has the same clothes and board as me, or I was probably still drunk and hallucinating. I went to the shop and bought my water and went home and slept. I woke and and did the usual reddit browsing and checking in with my friends. I messaged my friend to see how he was doing since he drank more than me and I left the bar slightly earlier than him. He messaged me back with \"I saw you before but you said you didn't recognise me wtf was up with you? lol\". \n\nI got scared and said I was probably still drunk and too tired to cope. I haven't told anyone because nobody would believe me and he would think I was a nut. I don't know what could have happened but I still doubt it was real and maybe I was hallucinating. I don't know what to believe but it hasn't really affected me at all, I just hope it doesn't happen again. ",

When she opened the text message app she noticed that several random messages were sent to a random number. The messages consisted of random letters and an emoji, that seemed to be trying to spell out certain words or make a specific statement. We called the random number that these messages were sent to and the number is out of service. There are 6 messages total over the course of the last two days and this is the first she has even noticed it. Has this ever happened to anyone with an android phone? A glitch in the phone or a glitch in the matrix ?? ",

        "text": "As anyone with a door knows, the lock on a doorknob is unlocked when it is horizontal (i.e. parallel with the ground) and it is locked when it is vertical. Well, about 10 years ago my mother had some cheap redneck install new doorknobs for us, as well some other things, including new sink handles. Both the sink handles and the lock were installed backwards -- I don't know what this guy's problem was, but the handles face towards you and you have to push them away from you to open the faucet.   \n\nNow, the lock on the front door is equally backwards. Vertical is unlocked, horizontal is locked. A few months ago, I went to open it, and it was locked -- it was back to normal, same positions as every other door.  \n\nI asked my dad, \"you finally fixed the knob?\" and he had no idea what I was talking about. My girlfriend agreed that it was backwards before, and was normal now. My dad insisted that it was always in the normal position. There was no one else to confirm or deny the lock, but it's a matter of disagreement between us to this day.",

He mentions in the video that if you shuffle a deck of cards really well, it's basically guaranteed that that sequence has never been created before, ever. I thought that was cool, and wanted to witness it myself. Got a deck of cards, separated it by suit, and put each suit in order, aces high. When I was doing the spades, I use a black joker for the eight of spades because it was missing. Searched the whole deck for it, nada. Did a riffle shuffle of the deck nine times, and said aloud the name of every card in order. The black joker was still in the deck, and I called in the eight of spades when I came to it. But the very last card was the actual eight of spades. Sorted the deck back into suits to double check and to my amazement I without a doubt had every card again.",

I got up to check it, and yup, it was still off. No way that the song was just “in my head” - while aware of its existence, I definitely didn’t like it or find it catchy at the time.\n\nIn retrospect, this must have been a clear isolated auditory hallucination..... but I have never had one before or since.

As soon as I laid down I saw someone walk into our room, I realized it was my mother in law, I sat up and said \"I didn't even hear you come in!\", Ignoring the fact that She randomly showed up at midnight because really you never know what that woman will do, lol. She walked around to my side of the bed and held out a light blue sealed envelope the size of one a birthday card would come in, and said \"Thank you\"... I reached up to take the envelope AND SHE JUST DISAPPEARED!! I sat there in stunned silence for a few seconds thinking WTF, I looked over to where my bf was laying thinking surely the talking woke him up, but he was still asleep, so I get out of bed and walk around the house for a minute, nothing is out of the ordinary so I go back to bed. I checked my phone and it had been less than 10 minutes since I first went to bed, so I know it wasn't a dream, which I also know it wasn't a dream because I know I hadn't had a chance to fall asleep because I had literally just laid down and hadn't even got to adjust myself and get comfortable yet. The next day I told everyone about it of course, and when I told my mother in law, she told me that she had seen her brothers like that shortly before they died. That freaked me out a little bit so I was worried about her for a while, but it's been close to a year and nothing's happened to her yet. That was crazy though. ",

After moving a set of drawers, I noticed a key laying on the floor just beneath my window. Upon inspecting it I realised it was the same brand as my own work key. So I pulled out my key and compared it to the one I found... exactly the same. Same pattern, same number engraved onto it. I decided to take it to work just to make sure, and I was able to unlock all the doors I usually could in the building. Here's why I found it weird though:\n\n- I was only ever given one key.\n- Everyone else at work only has one key.\n- Nobody I asked has lost their key before, or had any need for a spare.\n- The key wasn't there the last time I rearranged my room.\n- My window is always locked.\n- None of my coworkers have been to my house, and half don't even know where I live.\n- There's only supposed to be 8 keys to the building, everyone still has theirs.\n- They all have the words \"DO NOT COPY\" engraved onto them, no locksmith would copy them without the business owner's permission.\n\nSo this key has just appeared out of nowhere. I don't let anyone into my room unless it's super important, so I have no idea why or how it ended up in my room.",

We pulled into the driveway, and as I opened the car door, I almost hit a teenage boy who looked to be about my brother's age. I didn't recognize him, but he pretty much looked like someone my brother would hang out with, so I assumed he was a friend I'd never met. As I almost hit the boy with the car door he smiled and said \"sorry\", as most people do in Canada when someone else bumps into them. I awkwardly smiled back but didn't say anything. As I stepped out of the car door, I saw another figure of a teenage boy in jeans and a grey hoodie \\(hood up\\) emerge from the door to the passenger's seat. I assumed it was my brother because my brother pretty much wears clothes like that \\(I hadn't seen my brother all day until I got in the car that night, and since he was sitting in front of me I didn't get a good look at what he was wearing, but I know he often changes out of his uniform in the work change room before he leaves\\). Both boys started walking together out of the cul\\-de\\-sac towards the sidewalk. At first I figured my brother was just going to Tim Horton's or McDonald's with his friend. He often does this on weekend nights but not weekday nights.\n\n As my Dad and I walked towards the front door I said \"How come Mom's letting \\(brother\\) go out on a school night?\" \n\nDad says, \"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"He started walking with his friend. That guy who came on our driveway.\"\n\n\"What friend?\"\n\nAs I stepped in the house I realized my brother was in the basement \\(where his bedroom is\\). I stepped back outside, and there were no teenage boys on the driveway or on the sidewalk in the distance. ",

My brother was in front of me and said he saw him walk into his room also. \n\nMy cousin has always said his hallway was haunted and after that I believed. \nI haven't thought about this in years and now that I have I don't remember seeing him very clearly it was just the shape of a person around his height.\n\nI don't know what this is but it still baffles me.
