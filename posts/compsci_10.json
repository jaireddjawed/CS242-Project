I prompted ChatGPT to create a simple BNF, had it alter the BNF, then guided it through creating a simple \"programming language\" (really just a poor imitation of `bc` - barely). You can read the conversation [here](https://gpt.best/dUkxp2UA).\n\nOverall, the final _working_ code is 94% \"written\" by ChatGPT. Each of the responses I received I thought were impressive, and as I went further along I kept finding myself wowed by what was coming back. It was able to generate the code, understand how to use the code, execute code, and write tests for it. Pretty cool!\n\nYou can see the original and final code, and a diff, in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/aholmes/d86153f62093a6f257cb792ae9a228df).",

I will need an idea like remove the 3 number threes from the list or something like that. I just need the ideas and I will create a method for it. I am not asking for the code, I am asking for an idea that I can design a method for the linked list.\n\nEnglist is not my first language.

Idea A revolves around a business model similar to the oculus rift but I don’t know how to make it. Idea B would mainly need to know location and have a live update from another website. Think something similar to a 5 min reminder of stock moving to get the gist. \n\nIm sorry if that doesn’t make much sense but I’m struggling to comprehend where I need to go to begin this journey of making this (software?). I tried to learn python but it is difficult for me for some reason and I’m beginning to feel defeated. Honestly what I need to someone I can ask questions and help me guide through what I need to do and how to get it done. I have no doubt in my mind that if either idea were to be built I think that they could change 2 different industries entirely. I just don’t know how or where to begin. Thank you all for help and advice",

I'm working on an implementation and I'm thinking that first and foremost, I should create the puzzle generator.\n\nI'm thinking of utilizing a modified tree generation algorithm (perhaps Prim's?). Where some cells behave like \"walls\" in a typical maze.\n\nMy main question is... what do you think is the best data structure for this? I need to be able to check for cycles quickly. And I need to be able to associate each cell with the edges on its boundary.\n\nI was thinking of perhaps just using a naive nxm 2D array for the cells, generating a \"maze\" on top of them, populating every cell with its \"clue value\" and then removing clues until the game is barely solvable.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I was thinking I would maintain an array of arrays of the form `[[starting_i, starting_j], ...oneOfFourUnitVectors]` (which I call \"chains\", with each unit vector being a \"link\"). So this would be an array of all unconnected \"chains\".\n\nThoughts?",
