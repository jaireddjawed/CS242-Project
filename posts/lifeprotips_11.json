        "text": "Hey everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a not-so-fresh man who still feels like a financial noob,  I wish I had known more about finances when I was 19 and just starting college. Of course, I've learned a lot since then, including through both fixable and long-lasting mistakes, but I know there's still so much more to understand. That's why I wanted to share some essential financial advice for college freshmen, especially those renting and living alone, and everyone is welcome to add more!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.Don't underestimate the cost of housing: Living alone can be expensive, so it's important to do your research. Make sure you factor in rent, utilities, and any other costs associated with your housing situation. Still, getting roommates or finding a more affordable area are priorities if you live on a tight budget or don't receive financial help from your family.\n\n2.Basic finance skills are essential: Learn how to manage a checking account, how credit cards work, and how to create a budget. This will help you avoid unnecessary fees, overspending, and debt. Also, learn what taxes actually are and use pay stubs, especially when working multiple jobs.\n\n3.Stick to your budget: This is the key to good financial health. It's easy to overspend when you're on your own, so it's important to track your spending and make a budget that allows you to save money for emergencies and future expenses. Even when it seems no sum is enough, with clear planning and flexibility, you can live even on a reasonably small budget (for now).\n\n4.Consider an emergency fund: Emergencies happen, so having a financial safety net is important. Try to save enough money to cover at least an extra month of expenses (and later, 3-6 months).\n\n5.Start investing early: Not plugging any crypto bs, but small contributions to a retirement account or a low-cost index fund can add up over time.\n\n6.Chase any discount/free stuff/deals you lay your eyes on. Seriously, this saved me hundreds of dollars a year back in the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, if somewhat generic, and let's add to them in the comments! Thanks for reading through.",

While I currently have none on my phone, I still get into them from time to time. But, it used to be a lot worse. I would have multiple games and my screen time was 24/7. When I heard about how 9 days is approximately how long it takes your brain to lose its memory of a particular source of stimulation, I forced myself to delete all games off my phone and keep them off for nine days. It worked. \n\nSo, now when I get into a game and I find myself neglecting important things, I start the nine day break and I'm done with it.  The knowledge that the itch will go away in nine days is key.",

And trust me, a person who can consistently beat the market by more than one percent isn't gonna be buying you a steak dinner just to induce guilt. Depending on the country and set up, your \"advisor\" is likely also getting commission from whatever investment products he is selling you i.e. he is incentivized to actively work against you.\n\nIt doesn't matter if they are recommended by friends or family. (Though the worst ones come from your bank when they notice you have \"too much\" money in your savings account). If it is impossible to refuse to talk, listen to the pitch, smile, thank them, and tell them you will get back to them next week.\n\nIf you want to invest in stocks, get a cheap index fund. If you're an American you can buy government bonds directly from the US government (and there are cheap bond funds as well). And if you're into doing more than that, you DEFINITELY don't need an investment manager",

Ups and downs keep coming in life but we should keep doing our work and if we have more than necessary then we should help others.\n\nI lived my childhood very well. I was not that good at studies but I used to get enough marks to pass. I used to play a lot, and also had a lot of fun with my friends. But childhood was such a time in which we are neither worried about earning money nor worried about anything else.\n\nMy parents worked very hard themselves to make me study so that they could pay my school and college fees. Then I used to see them and seeing them, I thought at the same time that I will take good care of my parents in the future. After this, I earned well after my study and it was the result of my parent's hard work.\n\nMeanwhile, my father became ill. At that time I served him a lot and took care of him in every way. Taking care of them, I started facing problems in my work. But still, I kept on taking care of my father. Meanwhile, he died and left us. In the end, he said one thing to me, \"Son, I could not have found a better son than you. May you always be happy, this is my heart's desire.\"\n\nHearing this from him, I was very satisfied inside. Meanwhile, while leaving my father, my mother told me that he was a very nice person, but she only regret that he had no time for her. This talk of a mother forced me to think about whether I will have time for my future wife or not. In such a situation, I decided that I will start some new work from my home so that I can give time to my family and my health.\n\nAs time passed, work also started going well and then, I got married. I had a son after 2 years of marriage. Now he is handling his work. I have explained my life experiences to him in detail. He also manages his business keeping it at home. Apart from school studies, I taught him different skills, with the help of which today he learns many things himself.\n\nA few years after the birth of my son, my mother fell ill and her health started deteriorating a bit. I served them well as well and over time I started taking care of them. Then after 3 years he also died. Then I took good care of my wife and child. I would give time to my wife and child.\n\nNow job I am getting to know that I am going to live for a few months so I am not sad because I do not regret anything inside me. I lived my childhood well, took care of my parents, and gave time to my wife and children, which made them both happy. Along with all this, I also paid good attention to my health.\n\nIn the end, I would like to say to you that first of all you should pay attention to your health. Because if your body is not right then you will not be able to concentrate on anything. After health, you should pay attention to your family, the happier the family is, the happier you will be. After this you have to pay attention to money because without less money life becomes difficult that's why it is most important to do your work with honesty and use your brain in work. Even donkeys work hard.\n\nHe explained everything so well that I still remember his words very clearly. Now I am trying to live life like him.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/11jkqpk/lpt_how_to_kill_bed_bugs_effectively_and/",
        "text": "Bed bugs have a reputation of being difficult to deal with, but a lot of that stems from common misinformation you will find online, and also because many products sold to kill them simply don't work. For example, some people say to use ultra sonic pest repellents, bed bugs don't have ears. They have also largely developed immunity to the chemicals used in sprays and foggers. In fact, University of Rutgers Entomologist Dr. Wang, considered an expert on the topic of bed bugs, predicts 100% of bed bugs will be immune to them within 10 years. \n\n**So what actually works?**\n\nThe good news is there are still a couple methods that work very well, and the better news is that you don't have to spend much to get them. \n\n**For the bed bugs you *can't* see, *Diatomaceous Earth*.**\n\nDiatomaceous Earth is inexpensive, and is composed of silica. Silica will stick to bed bugs and draw moisture out of their bodies, dehydrating them to death. It also has the added benefit of transferring from one bed bug to another on contact, meaning when they walk back to their hidey-hole, it will transfer to bed bugs that might not have needed to leave to feed for a few weeks, and kill them as well. And since it dehydrates them, they will never develop an immunity to it.\n\nAnd with Diatomaceous Earth, a little goes a long, long way. When applying it in their foot path, a light dusting is all that is needed. Making piles of it only encourages them to find other ways of getting to where they want to be.\n\n**For the bed bugs you *can* see, *heat*.**\n\n122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius. Once they are exposed to that temperature, they die immediately. So a simple steamer can kill all the bed bugs that have found hiding spots that are more easily accessible, such as on the mattress or in the bed frame. And like D.E., heat is also something that they will never become immune to.\n\nThese two methods of eradication aren't going to be a single application process. The Diatomaceous Earth in this experiment had a 90% mortality rate at 10 days, so it may require a few weeks. It will also benefit greatly by being paired with a rigorous cleaning regimen, such as more frequent sheet washing in hot water, and dried on the hot setting, as well as frequent sweeping and vacuuming(and don't forget to empty the bag immediately after). So while it will involve some work, the alternatives can be costly, which can include companies that come to your home to make the entire interior reach temperatures that kill the bed bugs, and cost thousands of dollars to do so.\n\n**What is the evidence these methods work?**\n\nYoutuber Mark Rober recently made an in depth video on some experiments, which was overseen by entomologist Dr. Wang at Rutgers University, so you can see the results yourself!\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=460) is the setup for the experiment. You only need to watch 2 minutes from the beginning of this link to see the entire setup, variables, controls, etc.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=888) are the results of the experiment. You only need to watch 2 minutes and 12 seconds to see the entire result.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=1023) is how the Diatomaceous Earth and heat work to kill the bed bugs. You only need to watch one minute of this link to see how effective they are.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=1097) are some tips on how to prevent bringing them into your home. You only need to watch 1 minute from this point in the video to learn them all.\n\nAnd finally, [here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?) is the link to the entire ~24 minute video, if you just feel like learning more about bed bugs.",

I have 3 higher Ed degrees (bachelors, masters &amp; PhD, in social science/higher Ed). This became $250K in consolidated federal student loans ($187K principal). Until getting out of college once &amp; for all I lived 8 months in NYC (a job relocated me then fired me), then, lived in central Ohio for a year &amp; now southeastern WI for 8 years. I’ve traveled nationally &amp; internationally for work &amp; personal vacations. \n\nI have had to build &amp; rebuild a successful 29 year career. Financially, I lived outside of my means most of that career for 2 reasons: keeping up with friends as I asked them how they were living financially with no responses, and, not knowing enough personally to look beyond my family &amp; friends to research/determine financial planning resources for myself as soon as I started working. \n\nI bought my first house at 23 when I got my first stable job post-undergrad (after my AmeriCorps job hired me on full-time mid-term then laid me off, losing my education benefit). I soon after had my first financed car repossessed (I could not make timely payments because I hadn’t properly factored in my budget as a relative was living with me and wasn’t paying their bills on time). I gave the car back, bought a used one, sold the house (breaking even), quit the job &amp; went for  my Master’s degree full time. \n\nAfter the Masters, I worked about 2 years before going into the PhD full time. I applied to 4 schools, the one school that accepted me did not provide me any scholarships or assistantships because my GRE score was just under baseline for those. Instead of retaking it &amp; waiting + applying to other schools, I chose to go to the school to get through the PhD because I had relationships there I networked up in scale nationally &amp; internationally. It didn’t fully work the way I had hoped to build those networks into a firm foundational network of mentors for my career, but I did the best I could by making my mentorship asks clear, meeting them in person at conferences, following up and trying. \n\nI had one Ch 7 bankruptcy &amp; one Ch 13 bankruptcy I paid off in 5 years. I learned how to manage credit cards through these mistakes. \n\nThe best work experience I had was the past 8 years where I lived in my 2nd home I’d purchased (using $11k of retirement funds built from my graduate PhD work), moved an elder parent to the same city &amp; strengthened my career experience, built my retirement nest egg ($53K plus employer match = $107K accessible at age 55). However, I was in a situation where instead of saving I have a to religious organization (my former church for 2 of the 8 years, keeping up with “friends” the other 6 years). I have learned finally from those errors (I won’t call them mistakes). \n\nNow, I have chosen to be fully unemployed this past Oct 2022 to present (5+ months) after being offered a new position that doubled my salary but didn’t work out after 9 months (I quit without having another job secured b/c the situation was beyond me &amp; I prioritized my health). \n\nI am preparing to sell my 2nd home now (realtor confirmed estimated $98K in profit post-closing costs) &amp; looking into building a tiny home on wheels to live in the rest of my life. I have found land I aim to live on safely. \nI am applying to fully remote  jobs in higher Ed as I am now eligible for full Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I know more about how to rebuild my retirement &amp; save for my first emergency fund. \n\nI don’t have children or pets. I will only become a pet parent after I settle into my tiny home &amp; have my emergency fund. \n\n***\nI share all this to say - most of us know in our heads that “a car, a house, a job, a community, a family” is “the American dream” that most of us can’t maintain or afford &amp; we may not have resources we trust to help us learn. \n\nI’ll say more in the comments on what I suggest. Wishing you more success/less painful errors than me.",

        "text": "529 plans are tax-advantaged savings accounts (in the US) often used to pay for college (they can also be used for other higher education expenses and more options are occasionally added). To open one of these accounts, you do not need to name a beneficiary; you can just start contributing. This can reduce your taxable income and allow your money to grow tax-free. You can name a beneficiary for the account at any time (and it can even be yourself). \n\nFor example, I started one last year for my godson (who is my nephew). He's 4, so I have no idea if he'll even go to college, but if he does then he'll have 14 years of growth in the 529 account. And if he doesn't, then I can keep the money for myself or give it to another family member.\n\nWhy YSK: If you are unsure if you'll have kids, definitely don't plan to have kids but would like to help a family member, might go back to school yourself, or even just want to take some classes at a local community college someday - you can start saving for any of those things today and make up your mind later.",

        "text": "We met in summer 2019. We quickly “fell in love”- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt “head over heels” and she (34f) felt the same. She’s the most naturally beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other’s families and things were getting serious—saying “I love you” and making plans for our shared future—right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I’m “as handsome as ever”, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then— she had a boyfriend and we shouldn’t have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn’t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that “was music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‘long game’” because she wasn’t single.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she “does love me, but is scared.” After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like “we shouldn’t have done that”) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. \n\nI got routinely hurt—really badly—by her cruel hot/cold treatment of me. As an example, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would disagree with me in front of everyone. I also caught her in a lie—we had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn’t feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying “can’t wait to see you tonight” which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she double booked herself, but “really wasn’t feeling well.” I then went “no contact” in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship. Seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she realized over the last couple of months how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we had picked up where our last relationship ended. We were saying “I love you,” going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. Happiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, more critical of me than normal (I couldn’t do anything right; making the bed, cooking, she told me I was “annoying” and “cringey” in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other. I continued with my Herculean efforts—cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. In the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced “love bombing” —she would say things like “I hope our kids have your face,” “I can’t wait to move in with you,””I love you,” “I’m crazy about you” and “you’re so important to me.” This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she was now in a “serious” relationship and doesn’t “feel right about seeing each other one-on-one.” I told her I still love her, she simply said that was “problematic.” The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI ran into her the other day at CVS, turned down the isle and boom there she was. I walked up and said hi, she gave me a hug and I wished her well etc, and walked away. Seeing her was absolutely heartbreaking and I can’t stop thinking about her. I really just want to reach out to see how she’s doing— I care about her so deeply I can’t help it. \n\nI see that all her family and friends now follow him on social media, which is more than I ever got. He has seemingly eclipsed me and I can’t get over it. I feel worthless and the anxiety of them being together and me unable to do anything about it is horrible…unbearable. \n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, and how I can move on please share because I’m at a loss and can’t get over it. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Grief is one of the most unbearable but necessary of the human emotions. It is often hard to know what to say or do to comfort someone you love who is grieving TLDR at end). Here is what you should do:\n\n1. Call the person as soon as possible and acknowledge what’s happened (I’m sorry about your mom/dad/husband/etc.) and ask how they are doing. Then listen. \nDon’t attempt to rationalize it with phrases like, “at least they aren’t suffering.” If they don’t want to talk, just say you’re thinking about them and ask if there is a service you can attend.\n\n2. If there is a service—GO. \nTell them you are sorry about the death when you arrive. You don’t have to say anything else. Then take a seat or hang by the person and just BE THERE. They may cry and if they need a hug, give it. It is your presence that matters here. This is how you show that you care. There are no words to “fix” grief. They don’t exist. Show up to show you care. It will mean something to the person you love.\n\n3. Do not ask “what can I do” to the person grieving. \nThey are overwhelmed and unless you are an attorney, funeral director, or religious figure such as a priest or minister, there is little you can actually do except for be physically present for them. Except for one thing…\n\n4. Don’t ask, just bring them food. \nLeave it at their door if they aren’t home. Maybe call ahead and say you are dropping a pan of lasagna or ziti. Don’t linger unless they want you to. Bring rolls and salad too. People in grief may not think to eat. You are helping them by giving them an option they don’t need to think about. They may also have family members over from out of town and extra food is always a blessing in these situations. Make it easy for them to feed themselves and others. The food should be comfort food (Mac and cheese, ziti, etc. Just drop and go. \n\n5. Keep in touch after the funeral/memorial. \nThis is super important, especially after the loss of a child, parent, or spouse.\nCheck in on them. You don’t have to bring up the death. Just ask them how they are or see if you can hang out together for short stints (get coffee, etc.). \n\nGrief changes over time and it’s important to support the person you care about. You do this by reaching out. Don’t be discouraged if the grieving person doesn’t respond right away. Grief can be all consuming. Sometimes it is healthy to let this happen; to ride it out so you experience it, process it, and find your own peace with the loss. Allow the person space but keep trying to reach out. This is how you show you care.\n\nTLDR: I write this as someone who lost both their parents in an accident a few years ago, followed by my brother’s overdose less than a year later. Actions speak louder than words for the grieving. Show up, bring them food, and be there to listen.",

        "text": "The world of weight loss and personal health is filled with people trying to sell you the latest advice, product, fad diet, or gym service that will provide you with effective weight loss. The simple fact is that without a caloric deficit - you cannot lose weight, and all of these services provide you with some form of caloric deficit - whether it be working out and burning off calories, or consuming low calorie foods that results in consuming less calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight.  \n\nThere is a simple formula to lose weight:\n\nStep 1: Figure out how many calories your body needs to maintain its current weight. You can find calculators that provide you with this information online. Here is a link to one at the Mayo Clinic: \n https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304\n\nStep 2: Once you know your daily caloric requirements, you need to eat less than that number of calories each day to begin losing weight. Reducing your calories by 400 (for women) and 500 (for men) per day will result in a weight loss of around 1lb (~0.5kg) per week.\n\nStep 3: Set a weight loss goal. If you want to lose 20 lbs, you can easily achieve this over the course of 20 weeks by simply reducing your caloric intake by 400(W)/500(M) calories per day.\n\n---\n\nThere are great free calorie counting apps for your phone, such as MyFitnessPal that allow you to scan product barcodes and enter serving sizes to keep track of your calories, as well as tens of thousands of entries that you can choose from, such as 100g of carrots etc. to keep track of your intake.\n\nThe maximum safe level of weight loss (depending on the person) is considered to be 1.5 to 2.0lbs of weight loss per week, or a maximum of 800(W)-1000(M) calorie deficit per day.\n\nYou don't NEED to workout. You don't need to go to the gym 6 hours a week. You don't need to run 5 miles every other day. You don't need to go keto. These things help to contribute to your overall health and strength; but you don't need to do them to lose weight.\n\nYou can eat McDonald's for all 3 meals every single day for an entire year, and never do a single workout or jog - and you will still lose 50 lbs, provided that you only eat 1600 calories of that McDonald's each day. Of course this isn't a recommendation - in reality it would be terrible for your health - but it emphasizes the point. It's about the calories, not the types of foods.\n\nThe secret of weight loss is simple: your body requires a caloric deficit to lose weight. All miracle weight loss plans result in your body living with a caloric deficit in one form or another. The most simple and easy way to achieve a caloric deficit is to eat less calories than your body needs to stay at its current weight.\n\nFinally, most feelings of hunger are actually your body asking for water. If you feel hungry, drink a large glass of water. Wait 10 minutes to see if you're still hungry. If you still feel hungry; eat. But, that glass of water will aid in filling your stomach up before eating, and you will eat less than you would have had you not have drank the water first; so always drink a large glass of water 10 mins before eating.",
