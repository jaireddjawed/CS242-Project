However it is now time for him to upgrade to a newer laptop. He installed the program on the new laptop, however upon transferring the save file to the new laptop, it would only load records up to like 10 years ago. On his old laptop he can edit files as well as add new records without any problems, however, he can't seem to find a way to transfer the save file with all the data. There is no other save file on his computer and the file extension is .mdb. The company that made the program is no longer active! The program was developed for Windows 98. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
