        "text": "So I'm not very knowledgeable with hardware and kernels and I thought this interaction was an interesting example (possibly, as I stand to be corrected in my interpretation) of the possible pitfalls of using AI assistive technologies and interesting to share.  Also, I feel like I'm being gaslit or just very unknowledgeable, so if someone could shed some light (a bit of Googling didn't really) that would be appreciated. \n\nI started off by asking chatGPT what the early design choices in Linux were that proved to be limiting or poor in hindsight (I'm fascinated by its ability to answer complex abstract speculative questions) and it said the Linux kernel's 32-bit addressing was a limiting factor as it limited processes to sometimes inadequate amounts of memory. I'm no expert but I know that means ~3-4GB so I was immediately suspicious. At the same time, it had answered other similar questions scarily well so I started to doubt myself. I asked what the practical limitations were of 32-bit addressing in this context and it confirmed what I said above. I then asked if there wasn't a 64-bit kernel and it then said there was and it allowed programs to address more memory. I then pointed out that it contradicted itself and it said this:\n\n```\nBut I thought you said the Linux kernel was limited to 32-bit addressing?\n\n...\n\nYes, that is correct. The Linux kernel is limited to using 32-bit addressing, which means that it can only access up to 4 GB of memory. This can be a limiting factor for some users, particularly on systems with a large amount of memory or when running resource-intensive applications. However, while the kernel itself is limited to 32-bit addressing, the operating system as a whole is not. Linux provides support for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, and users can run a mix of both on a single system. This allows users to take advantage of the performance benefits of 64-bit applications while still using the 32-bit kernel. Additionally, some Linux distributions include support for a feature called \"PAE\" (Physical Address Extension), which allows the kernel to access more than 4 GB of memory by using a larger address space. This can help to mitigate some of the limitations of the 32-bit kernel, but it is not a perfect solution and does not provide the same benefits as a true 64-bit kernel.\n```",

I've switched from PulseAudio to PipeWire, updated BlueZ, and installed Bluetooth Manager from where I can select HSP/HFP profile with mSBC codec. This doesn't totally wreck the audio in headphones, it's tolerable, but it's still significantly worse than when using A2DP Sink profile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any potential to get the same pure sound quality when using HSP/HFP as with A2DP? My understanding is I have to use the former if I want two way communication (mic to work).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

For a while I was using the disable_ertm hack and a cable as a fallback to get around it but it wasn't a perfect solution. Searching online I found that updating the controllers firmware should fix the issue, but as best I understand it can only done be via a Window app.\n\nIn theory you could use qemu to assist here, but when I tried it the controller would change usb hosts repeatedly. In theory you could pass the usb controller over, but that was too much hassle for me, so I grabbed a spare hard drive and install stick.\n\nThe part that really stung was after going through the process of setting up the hardware and os, I also needed to log in with a Live account just to update the firmware (just why?) which then tried to integrate the machine to my account. The number of dark patterns seem to be ever increasing. Only minutes after install and I'm already missing the \"user first / no non-sense\" approach Linux gives.\n\nAt least in the end the controller now works better with Bluetooth, and seeing pv's progress of wiping Window's fingerprints from existence feels a bit cathartic.",

        "text": "I just got a Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IAH7 laptop last week, with a 512 GB NVME SSD.\n\nIt came with no OS preinstalled, and I wanted to install Kubuntu 22.04.1 on it.\n\nAfter successfully partitioning the drive using the default partition setup, the installer started copying files but then got stuck at 40% for about a minute, before spitting out this message:\n\n&gt; The installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk:  \n&gt;  \n&gt; [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/target/usr/lib/thunderbird/libxul.so'  \n&gt;  \n&gt; This is often due to a faulty hard disk. It may help to check whether the hard disk is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler environment.\n\nAt that point, my hard drive no longer showed up in `lsblk`. And indeed, rebooting and checking the BIOS, where it previously listed the NVME SSD on the main info page, it now showed: `Hard Disk [Not Detected]`.\n\nThinking I must have received a bad unit, I took it back to the shop and they exchanged it.\n\nRinse and repeat, and *the exact same thing happened again* with the second laptop. Now I'm at a loss. Since the BIOS does not even detect the hard drive, I have no idea how to proceed. Is there any way I can still salvage this laptop, or will I have to return it to the shop again with my tail between my legs?\n\nDo Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming laptops have some fundamental compatibility issue with Linux? I've installed various Linux distros on probably over a hundred machines across two decades and never had anything like this happen, so I don't think I stuffed it up (twice)... but it's always possible I missed something unusual about this laptop.",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zcy0tn/the_linux_process_journey_watchdogd/",
        "text": "This kernel thread “watchdogd” is used in order to let the kernel know that a serious problem has occurred so the kernel can restart the system. It is sometimes called COP (Computer Operating Properly). The way it is implemented is by opening “/dev/watchdog”, then writing at least once a minute. Every time there is a write the restart of the system is delayed.\n\nIn case of inactivity for a minute the watchdog should restart the system. Due to the fact we are not talking about a hardware watchdog the compilation of the operation depends on the state of the machine. You should know that the watchdog implementation could be software only (there are cases in which it won’t restart the machine due to failure) or using a driver/module in case of hardware support (you can read more about it here - [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.rst](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.rst)). \n\nIf we are talking about hardware support then the watchdog module is specific for a chip or a device hardware. It is most relevant to systems that need the ability to restart themself without any human intervention (as opposed to a PC we can reboot easily) - think about an unmanned aircraft. We need to be careful because a problem in the watchdog configuration can lead to unpredictable reboot, reboot loops and even file corruption due to hard restart ([https://linuxhint.com/linux-kernel-watchdog-explained/](https://linuxhint.com/linux-kernel-watchdog-explained/)). \n\nThe relationship between the hardware and software is as follows: the hardware is responsible to set up the timer and the software is responsible to reset the timer. When the timer gets to a specific value (configured ahead) and it is not elapsed by the software the hardware will restart the system. For an example of using hardware for this functionality you can read the following link [https://developer.toradex.com/linux-bsp/how-to/linux-features/watchdog-linux/](https://developer.toradex.com/linux-bsp/how-to/linux-features/watchdog-linux/).  \n\nThe software part is being conducted by the “watchdogd” (the software watchdog daemon) which opens “/dev/watchdog” and writes to it in order to postpone the restart of the system by the hardware - for more information you can read [https://linux.die.net/man/8/watchdog](https://linux.die.net/man/8/watchdog). Examples for different watchdog drives/modules for specific chips can be found in the source tree of linux here [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0.11/source/drivers/watchdog](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0.11/source/drivers/watchdog). Some example are apple\\_wdt (Apple’s SOC), ath79\\_wdt (Atheros AR71XX/AR724X/AR913X) and w83977f\\_wdt (Winbond W83977F I/O Chip).\n\nWe can stop the watchdog without restarting the system by closing “/dev/watchdog”. It is not possible if the kernel was compiled with “CONFIG\\_WATCHDOG\\_NOWAYOUT” enabled. \n\nOverall, in order for the watchdog to operate the kernel needs to be compiled with CONFIG\\_WATCHDOG=y and “/dev/watchdog” character device should be created (with major number of 10 and minor number of 130 - checkout “man mknod” if you want to create it). \n\nLastly, if you want to see the status of the watchdog you can use the command “wdctl” ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wdctl.8.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wdctl.8.html)) -  As can be seen in the screenshot below ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog\\_timer#/media/File:Wdctl\\_screenshot.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer#/media/File:Wdctl_screenshot.png)) . For more information about the concept I suggest reading [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog\\_timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ela8fd1dm04a1.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f62aa675c0f514c9a2ee006ac2a6d198273d37db",

But funnily enough, i was playing around with the openaichat and fed it different codes and tried to see if it can be improved. I went a little further and copied the vulkan/bvh/bvh.h code file from the mesa repository and asked if it can be improved further for speed and efficiency. The ai introduced me to a kd-tree method to apply those suggestions i asked and incorporated it into the original code. I wnated to share all the screen shots with the ai explaining every detail of why it did those things and how to implement them. But this subreddit doesn't allow for pictures from galleries. I found it fascinating and hilarious at the same time since i'm just a beginner when it comes to code but it sounded so logical and readable when it explained everything in details. I will try to provide the screenshots i got from the discussion. What do you guys think ?",
