        "text": "In the coming months I'll be leaving my high-ranking position at a non-profit to work for myself. This is going to create some variation in my income and I will certainly make less for a while, so it has been changing the way I think about money quite a bit.\n\nLast night I asked the wife to go to the grocery store with me to hunt for deals. This is not something I have done most of my post-college life. Instead I would get an idea of what I would want to make for a meal, go to the store, and buy the ingredients. I am a hobbyist cook and it was fun for me. Cost was not really a consideration, unfortunately. This led to many of our meals costing as much as dining out. Time to change.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of our haul last night:\n\n* .49 /lb bananas\n* .68 yogurt\n* .68 frozen vegetable blends\n* .99 bags of fresh spinach\n* .99 cottage cheese\n* $1.25 tuna packets\n* $2/lb fresh chicken wings (trimmed)\n* $2/lb pork shoulder\n* $2.99/lb racks of ribs\n\nIn total last night we spent $130. We really stocked up on the items less than $1. In addition to the bulk beans and grains and tons of condiments we already had, our fridge, freezer and pantry is pretty full. I imagine if we were stuck at home we could live for 1-2 months.\n\nI do live in a lower COL area, so if you are in a big coastal city you may need to adjust up by some percentage, however most things have been getting expensive here too. We visited two different stores to hunt for deals, and it was worth it. These are regular grocery chains, not the super discount ones as we don't have those in our town.\n\nOur plan was to look for clearance sales that made us say \"wow\"! Most stores have special stickers and bins for markdowns so keep an eye out. Not needing (wanting) anything in particular gave us the freedom to pass up things we didn't think were an amazing deal. Most of the items we bought I would consider quite healthy and we bypassed the junk sections.\n\nOne key is you need to be flexible with what you will eat. I wish I could convey to a lot of my family and friends that there is no such thing as a \"staple\" food item. You aren't going to die if you stop consuming milk, bread and eggs. Try some different foods! You may be able to save a lot of money and get more nutrition in the process. Anything you feel you \"have to\" buy will take you for a ride when prices increase.\n\nIn the past I would easily exceed $100 just buying a weekend's worth of food for 2 people. In my experience, working late and coming home exhausted makes us want to trade money and health for convenience, which can negate at least somewhat from the extra pay some careers offer as their perceived benefit. This is a big part of my motivation for my career change. I am ok giving up some income for more time, and I will have energy to figure out how to spend less in the process (making my own meals, having time to hunt for bargains, etc.). I already do all my own home and car maintenance so that is in my favor.\n\nWhat sounds like a bad financial decision may actually be a smart one — try going to the grocery store when you don't need anything!",

They also did things I original said not to do, like change the sheets of the bedroom which probably took extra time.\n\nAnyways, the reason I’m probably not too impressed is because they originally quoted me $525 for the initial clean, and then charged me $600 since the cleaners we here longer than expected $77/hr per cleaner.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/108h0ed/how_i_achieve_practically_zero_food_waste/",
        "text": "u/idiocracyi recently posted a link to an article that said that a third of food that gets produced is wasted.  These stats have always blown my mind, even though I'm pretty sure that a large portion of that is due to production and supply chain issues rather than consumer waste.  Still, it was (metaphorically) beat into me at a young age to never waste food (my parents lived through the Dutch famine), and I have worked out a system in my 20 years of adult life that means that pretty much no food gets wasted in my household.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 1:  Meal planning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you aren't used to it, this can seem like a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be, even though it does need to factor in every meal.  On Friday nights, I check online flyers, see what (if anything) needs to be used up in the fridge, mentally chart out the following week, and update my grocery list accordingly.  A typical plan might be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSat brunch: eggs, fried potatoes &amp; veggies (peppers &amp; onions)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSat supper: beef stir fry (peppers, carrots, onions, broccoli) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSun brunch:  steamed dumplings \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSun supper:  chicken Cajun pasta with veggies (peppers, onions)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekday lunches (M-T): leftover stir-fry \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekday lunches (W-F): bean &amp; veggie soup with bread\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM-W supper: leftover pasta\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nT-F supper: pork chops, mashed potatoes, veggies\n\n \n\nBreakfast (M-F): oatmeal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only quick perishables on my grocery list are peppers, carrots, broccoli, and chicken thighs, and with the menu as planned I should use all of those up within a week.  If I'm low on anything else, I don't replace it until needed, no matter what, because of the next step.  Planning it this way also means that I only have to cook once or twice during the week, which reduces the need for splurge foods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 2: rethink staple foods\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI rarely restock anything in my fridge that isn't on the immediate meal plan. Am I out of sour cream? Oh, well.  My favourite condiment?  It can wait.  Eggs?  I have enough for the weekend.  To me, staple foods that I keep in my house consistently are items that go in my pantry or freezer and have 3 month+ expiration dates (flour, oats, pasta, beans, meat (I have a vacuum sealer, which helps me stock up), root vegetables, etc).  I also generally only restock these unless they're on sale.  The only exceptions are if the item in question has a reasonably long fridge life AND is on enough of a sale to justify the purchase (real parmesan is a good example of this).  This not only reduces the risk of throwing out half-finished yogurt, but also helps keep me on the meal plan, which futher reduces the risk of waste.  If there is an amazing sale for something i love, I'll incorporate it into the meal plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 3: Back up plans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife doesn't always work as planned, and if I'm really stressed or sick it would be tempting to skip cooking once in a while.  It could also be that I really don't feel like eating the same thing for the third day in a row after all.  When that happens, I put the planned meal in the freezer (if necessary), and take out a different freezer meal.  This could be a frozen lasagna I picked up on sale, leftovers from a previous week's meal plan, or a completely new freezer meal.  I plan ahead for these backups by further reducing my waste.  Let's say on a random Wednesday I notice my broccoli is looking limp.  I whip up a quick pasta that uses the rest of it, and pop it in the freezer for a later date (FYI, saucier dishes resist freezer burn better).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 4:  stock prep\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf all else fails, I always have my stock bags.  I save vegetable scraps (onion and garlic skins, carrot &amp; celery ends, herb stems, etc) in freezer bags for when I want to make a batch of stock.  If I have a few carrots or other vegetables that have reached a point where I really don't want to cook them, I just chop them up and throw them in the same bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of these informal rules, I operate very close to zero waste.  It's not perfect (pineapples are brown when you cut them open; a container of leftovers is hiding in the back and gets completely forgotten, etc), but it's as close as I'm able to get it.",

About a tablespoon of flax seed replaces one egg, so you can get about 60 eggs worth for $3-4. You might have to play around with the ratio of water to flax seed to get your flax eggs the right consistency but for mine about 1:1 ratio of flax seed to water works perfectly. I’m a cookie baker and this is how I make my vegan cookies and I get rave reviews on them. \n\nOf course this doesn’t help if you want to make omelettes but it can help your eggs go further if you don’t have to use them for baking.",

I come from a place of financial ruin after getting sick and being chronically sick for five years without diagnosis of an autoimmune disease. Doing a lot better now. Almost died from covid after being diagnosed. I’ve been working to rebuild my life and am working again, but entry level. BS. Something I whoosh r be doing because I have more skills than needed. Either way, it’s what I’m doing for now with the hope of a promotion and/or getting into a new career. Good benefits. Blah blah. \n\nI’m looking for a new apartment. Gonna have to pay around $500 more a month than I have been. Was able to save a lot by just working with what we have here. So am going to need to buy actual furniture and whatever else. \n\nHow can I stay frugal and save money/get a decent place to live with the way things are? Inflation and yet STILL incomes don’t actually match the rate. Who has all of this money to pay for a $3k apartment? It boggles my mind seeing the pricing for apts. Are there hoards of rich people all over and I’m just not one of them?\n\nI want to maybe utilize furniture deals, like FB market place or floor model deals. But am scared to death of bedbugs. I’m honestly hoping I can get a decent apartment with no infestations with the measly $2k I can pay PER MONTH. \n\nAny tips to not go into financial ruin during this process are super appreciated.",

The energy is smooth and I don’t get the crash from overloading coffee early. I can also drink a cup later in the day without worrying about keeping me up late. It also hydrates me. No regrets.",

I found out they're nutritious &amp; can be used in a number of ways. \nThere's several blogs that talk about the uses of garlic peels.\n\nMy trick is I put them on a paper plate then microwave them when I'm done peeling. After a minute or two of cooking they should be crispy enough.\nThen I roll up the paper plate to crumble it up &amp; if it's crispy enough you can have it crumble into flakes.\nAnother way is to wrap them in foil then add to the oven when cooking a meal &amp; leave it in for 5-10 minutes to make crispy. \nI mixed it into thanksgiving stuffing, chili, salsa, &amp; roast so far. Can also make a decent pizza herb.\n\nFor the garlic itself I often use raw garlic cloves to make heart cleansing salsa after pressing them. The garlic peel flakes can act as a herb &amp; filler for the watery salsa.",

My mum makes her own granola, and I loveee it bc she adds a sprinkle of salt to make it more savoury, so I took inspo from her and decided to try and make my own! I already had oats on hand, and instead of adding salt I just crushed up some of the salted mixed nuts I have from Costco, and my granola turned out amazing 🎉\n\nYesterday I was thinking about doing this more regularly since I've seen people on this sub say how much money they save making their own granola, so naturally I turned to our lord and saviour Bulk Barn to do some casual calculations. The Harvest Crunch granola I usually get is $1.22/100g. The recipe I followed used 3c oats and 1c nuts, and it seems thar just the cost of nuts alone would bring the cost of my homemade granola to $2+/100g, then comes the cost of a binder like honey or maple syrup atm 😭\n\nI'm going to try a recipe that substitutes the expensive oils like butter or coconut with apple sauce next time I make granola, but how do you Canadians, especially Ontarians such as myself, make homemade granola in a way that costs less than store-bought? Is this even possible??",

As it shipped, I began feeling bad, and that I will have buyer's remorse. I didn't need it technically, as I had another laptop I've been using for years.\n\nWell, this laptop arrived a week ago and BLEW my expectations away. The screen is much larger and crisper than the small laptop I normally use. The keyboard is comfortable, not clunky like my other one. I just love the feeling of using it, and have been bringing it everywhere with me. I've used it to work and to read e-books mostly. I imagine I'll be using my laptop MUCH more in the future than I normally would. Smooth feel is so much better than clunkiness.    \n\nAt $400, this is an investment and also will give me a backup laptop in case 1 dies. I imagine I'll spend many hours of reading on it that I otherwise would not have. It will completely replace my other laptop. At that $400 price level I could hardly ask for more. \n\nIn my mind, it was well worth it. Folks, sometimes a little bit of splurge is OK. Just be ready to take the risk, and return it if things don't work out. Think about it before you press the 'buy' button. On occasion, what you get might be the exact OPPOSITE of buyer's remorse.",

        "text": "I have an acquaintance who makes soap as a hobby and she gave me a bunch. Unfortunately, the soap clog my drains.   \nI googled some ways to use soap in different ways but most involve washing in some way which would clog my sinks.   \nOne suggestion was to put it in my closet/drawers to make it smell good but I don't know if its lost its scent already or what but it doesn't work and it doesn't get used up, anyways.  \nThe results involving turning soaps into candles are kind of iffy. Seems like I have to buy candle wax and then shave a little soap on it. So it seems like I'm spending money to use these soaps I got for free and don't want... I am not even a big candle person.   \nI don't feel too good about giving them away and potentially clogging someone's drains because I did have to pay to get it unclogged.  \nI feel a but bad about throwing them away because they were gifts but I feel like it may come to that.   \nAny other ideas?",
