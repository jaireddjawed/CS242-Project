        "text": "I thought about this because of something that happened to me on Discord today. I was on a very active server but I could also see that the discussion level was pretty low and the mods were a bit weird to say the least. Still, it was the only active chat server for my hobby anywhere online so it was the only game in town. Today I just got banned from it. No message and I can't think up a reason I was banned. It feels random. I guess it doesn't matter. Mods have the power to ban for fun or even just ban random people. It's their house and their rules and everyone else just has to follow their rules even if these rules are just their daily mood.\n\nBut this made me think about Reddit and how I was banned for neutral messages from some subs here. If I knew this had happened to other people I would leave the sub or forum. If I saw mods just banning random users or banning someone because of his favorite color or whatever I would call the mods out straight away. And I guess this is also what happens before a mass ban on some political subs on Reddit. But still thousands of people happily use the subs. I get that the topic in the sub might be interesting but why do you choose to take part in this kind of atmosphere? Making a new sub is free. Why are people accepting this stuff and often even praising mods who ban people based on their daily mood? Some mods seems to just live online and complain about their daily life while taking out their anger on random users by first bullying them and then banning them. I just don't understand how even a single sane person thinks that's okay behavior in any way. And how they think such a person should be responsible for people anywhere in life.",

        "text": "There is a running joke amongst Redditors that we care too much about useless internet points.  Of course this isn’t true for all users, as some really do browse simply to browse.  I would argue that (sub)consciously, we *do* care about karma.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPoint One: **Engagement**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmassing karma has a couple byproducts, one of which being replies.  Consider a post or comment gets 1k+ upvotes.  This will almost every time yield responses and replies to *your* post.  This gives us the opportunity to engage in conversation about whatever the topic may be (which you, the poster, has set).  This is purely conjecture, but I imagine a site like this has as many introverts as it does extroverts and there are many users on the site.  This opportunity for engagement defeats the necessity to do the uncomfortable: irl engagement.   It’s a lot easier to discourse with a username instead of a person.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPoint Two:  **Impression**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis point ties into the first, but directly deals with the upvotes instead of the replies.  Take for instance that 1k+ upvoted post you submitted earlier.  For each of those upvotes, there is a person out there who read the post and had a positive reaction to it.  There is a sense of power and wellbeing knowing that one of your original (or not, but I’ll touch on that later) thoughts is held and heralded as good by so many other people.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPoint Three: **Accumulation**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhether it be bottle caps, buttons, or karma, collecting and accumulating things is a fun thing to do - regardless of how meaningless it is.  For example, buttons.  There are people out there (and I’m sure there’s a sub for it) for people who collect and enjoy buttons.  Though buttons themselves are nearly useless as collected items (no offense intended to button collectors), they are still collected and sought after by individuals.  I believe the same goes for karma.  It’s useless, but still sought by any means necessary.  It’s not about the points themselves, as it is about the points as a whole, if that makes sense.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Things I Don’t Understand**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Reposters**:  perhaps there is a reason for it, but I haven’t understood it (aside from wanting to sell that account).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSorry if none of this is new thought and poorly laid out, I’m currently at work running on caffeine not sleep.  I look forward to engaging with you guys regarding karma :-)",

These type of mods get to stroke their \"e-peen\" and be lazy at the same time. \n\nMost of the time the mod doesn't even bother justifying the lock with \"thread derailed,\" instead they condescendingly speak to the readership as if they were children. Meanwhile a nicer, invigorating conversation that **most people who come to the thread are seeing** has been silenced.\n\nI understood the need for this tool with Bulletin Board Systems (traditional forums), where there was no tree structure to the comments; in these cases shitty comments could totally derail a thread. This was especially true because any post could still be seen in quotations of that post even if the original one was removed. There's no real need for that in reddit, just remove the entire tree of the comment and move on.",

Thank you for your help.\n\nAs such, I've decided to discuss a topic which was [discussed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/52yvom/why_do_so_many_ops_of_wildly_successful/) a while back.\n\nWhat proportion of accounts [non-throwaway, but long-term active users] would you say are \"reboot\" accounts  that have deleted their original account and returned with a new one, and what proportion of \"reboot\" accounts have left their original account undeleted [either through forgetting their password and not having email, or scrambling the password].\n\nLet's exclude accounts created for /r/r4r, /r/dirtyr4r, /r/bdsmpersonals etc. from the equation since they're often single-purpose and/or throwaway accounts.\n\nI did have an account here in 2014, then deleted it, and created this account in 2015, so I'm one of them. I could delete this account and start again, but it'd take me time to re-gain karma and have active privileges to start a subreddit.\n\nWhy do you think some people delete their account and come back with new ones aside from reasons like privacy, \"trolling\" etc.\n\nCould some people use them to get around a \"You have been banned from xyzsubreddit\" by starting afresh?\n\nAs a mod of small obscure subreddits, I've never had to deal with this, but then again, one's a sandbox subreddit [so enforcement of rules will be pretty lax, aside from reddiquette, self-promotion and anything that could get people suspended] and the other two are dead subreddits.\n\nI'm not trying to be a rules lawyer here, but, do you think some people *will* do that, and the rules generally go unenforced on this sort of thing? [not that I'm going to do that, but some people probably will].\n\nIn general, what's your opinion on this sort of thing? Is it good or bad for Reddit.",

Talk about meta.\n\nIn this essay I want to explore two questions:\n\n1. Do reposts have utility?\n\n2. Are reposts ethical? \n\nAs for question 1, I think the answer is self-evident: Assuming the reposts are not vote manipulated,  the reposts indubitably have utility to Redditors. Otherwise they wouldn't have upvoted it.\n\nAs for question 2, are reposts ethically justified? That is a harder question to answer, but I would argue yes. Reposts bring awareness to those who have never seen the posts before and serve as reminders/nostalgia for those who have. How the repost is perceived is partially determined by how often the repost is seen. When too often, it becomes obnoxious.\n\nI have no figures on this—this is pure speculation—but I think the strong dislike of reposts comes from a vocal minority of so-called 'power users' who heavily frequent Reddit. Because they visit Reddit so often, they grow weary of seeing the same posts time and time again.\n\nFor more casual users, they probably haven't even seen the original post prior to the repost. So for them the repost is likely fresh information. Or, in case they have seen the post once or twice before, a pleasant nostalgic reminder.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is whether the reposts credit the original creator(s). What rubs Redditors the wrong way is when OP is a bundle of sticks, pretending the repost is original content; profiting from social validation ('imaginary internet points') without having created, or at least having contributed to the content, the latter the case with memes.\n\nThe repost is a repetition, yes, but Humans have a tendency to forget, and repetition is key to learning. Additionally, Humans ascribe value to nostalgia (think about movie studios cashing in on nostalgia.) The repost could thus carry nostalgic value. I'm retreading an earlier point; after all, there is value in repetition, on the condition it isn't obnoxious.*\n\n*Nor confusing the point of the post, as can be the case with elaborate philosophical dissertations and writers fond of wordplay—as the reader might have trouble discerning the repetition of earlier information from fresh information, getting lost in a proverbial whirlpool of similar words.",

        "text": "This is two separate questions but they may be related enough I'm keeping them together for this post. \n\n1) **What caused the decline of /r/AdviceAnimals?**\n\nAA still gets a lot of activity but it's no longer the front page dominating powerhouse that it once was. I used to see multiple posts a day from it near the top of /r/all. Now it can be days between seeing a post. There are two possible reasons I can think of but I'm not sure either of them really explains it fully.\n\n* Years ago around when the ~~Racist~~ Unpopular Opinion Puffin was starting to take over the sub and they were starting to build a certain reputation, Reddit expanded the default subs from 25 to 50 and dropped AA as a default. It's possible that at this point new users weren't automatically seeing the sub and it started a gradual decline then.\n\n* That image macro format has gotten stale and people have moved on to other memes. All meme type content seems to have a finite lifespan before people tire of it and latch on to something new so this seems like it could be a good explanation. However, I haven't noticed any subreddit that fills the personal story niche that AA does, which leads me to question 2.\n\n2) **Why hasn't a large \"personal story\" subreddit risen up to replace AdviceAnimals?**\n\nReddit loves (and hates) personal story posts. /r/AskReddit has added multiple rules over time from banning stories and \"I'll start\" in titles to completely banning use of the text box to keep them from overrunning the subreddit. /r/pics has always had a steady stream of them that ebb and flow leading to posts [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1mdknc/rpics_we_need_to_talk/) or subreddits like /r/no_sob_story as users get tired of seeing the personal story posts. Almost any general topic subreddit devolves into this sort of content unless the mods are proactive about it. \n\n/r/AdviceAnimals became the powerhouse that it was not with the original Advice Animal memes ([generic joke image macros](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-dog)) but when they evolved into a format for sharing a personal story. Now that they aren't getting the visibility they once did I would think all the people that want to share personal stories and all the people that like to upvote them would have moved to a replacement subreddit. I haven't seen any subreddit that is filling this niche currently though.\n\n/r/pics still has plenty of upvoted cancer and weight loss and sob story posts so I don't think the voting masses have tired of personal story posts. So where they have all gone? Are they just being spread out across a wider array of subreddits now? Why hasn't a single subreddit risen up for these posts instead?\n\n\nEDIT: People seem to be more hung up on the meme aspect that I intended. From my observations of reddit over the years there has always been one main subreddit people flocked to to tell their personal stories. From AskReddit with their story in the title until it was banned, to pics, to f7u12, to AdviceAnimals, back to AskReddit using the text box until that was banned etc. The common theme is that people are telling a personal story whether it be an image macro, rage comic, or whatever. In the past as one subreddit banned these posts or as the format died out (like f7u12) they'd all migrate to a new sub that would become the de facto place to go tell your story. In the case of AdviceAnimals this time it's dropped off without everyone flocking to another specific subreddit.",

I thought, why isn't this automatically 'regulated'?  Why not give a post flare or something that is a *repost* symbol? Why not allow a bot to be summoned to recognize a repost and delete/lock/cite the OC? Since comments usually contain the link to the OC?\n\nI imagine it as this in a sub:\n\n**Post Title**\n*Repost symbol/text* from *OC User* on *OC sub* by *reposting user*\n\nIt could work to the benefit of the OC User being properly cited and the OC sub, plus the sub the repost was submitted would benefit from connecting users to a sub they didn't know existed. \n\nThere could also be some consequence for users that only repost or something.  I see reposts equivalent to how Tumblr does reblogging; but that is for individuals sharing others content along with their own and the source is included in the reblogging post unless a user saves/copies the OC and reblogged/posted as their own, which is devalues the OC like it does on Reddit.  But I feel like a user can flag a repost by commenting the OC link and a bot after some comparison or X upvotes would cite/remove/lock the reposted sub.\n\nSo, I hope this is in the correct sub, askreddit seemed more for generic non-reddit.  If this is easily answered, I'm sorry if it could also be part of reddit's \"small government\" mentality. (let the subs regulate themselves, but no sub can be about child pornography etc.)\n\n***tl:dr*** I don't understand why reposts aren't more controlled, consequential or accommodated for content dispersion and/or beneficial to the OC User and/or OC's sub.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello Reddit theorists,\n\nToday I'd like to share some ideas we've developed internally about Reddit communities. [At the Reddit office](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/3c1l7c/remake_meanwhile_at_reddit_hq/) we spend a lot of time trying to understand what makes communities work, and in order to do that, we've segmented our research into communities across **Topics** and **Archetypes.**\n\n**Topic** segmentation is the most natural way to break down the differences we see across communities on Reddit. Topics describe a \"flavor of content\" like sports, gaming, fashion, television, etc. Topic segmentation has guided our thinking for a really long time.\n\nMore recently, we've been exploring the idea of **Archetypes** – segmentation of communities that describes behavior, not just content. Below are a list of 10 archetypes that we think exist. There are probably a lot more, but I wanted to riff with you all on this idea now.\n\n**Passions** \\- communities dedicated to a hobby or interest. These communities are focused on discussion of the hobby and sharing of experiences within the hobby. These communities sometimes features Q&amp;A and can be new user friendly, but once in awhile they can be a bit new user un\\-friendly. Some examples include:\n\n* r/gardening\n* r/chefknives\n* r/MakeupAddiction\n* r/skiing\n* r/Porsche\n* r/DIY\n\n**Fandoms** \\- communities dedicated to discussion, news, media, and experiences with a particular external entity. Fandoms are distinct from Passions as they are driven almost entirely by the schedule or season of their external entity. Highly schedule oriented and episodic.\n\n* r/westworld\n* r/donaldglover\n* r/FortNiteBR\n* r/nba\n* r/warriors\n* r/\\&lt;insert\\_sport | insert\\_sports\\_team | insert\\_anime\\_series |insert\\_reality\\_show |insert\\_game\\_title\\&gt;\n\n**Advice/discussion** \\- These are communities that frequently feature text based discussion or Q&amp;A around a specific topic. Experts tend to congregate here to provide guidance and hang out. These communities tend to be new user friendly. By contrast, Passion subs tend to be newbie hostile. Different than Human Condition communities \\- in those communities almost all participants share a common need \\(were all going through something together\\) whereas in Advice, many of the long term users don’t need the help, they just hang out to provide it to others.\n\n* r/relationships\n* r/personalfinance\n* r/changemyview\n* r/PoliticalDiscussion\n\n**Human Condition** \\- communities dedicated to different human stories and conditions. People in these communities often provide support to each other and rely on their community as a group of peers and confidantes.\n\n* r/asianamerican\n* r/cancer\n* r/BabyBumps\n* r/stopsmoking\n\n**Media** \\- communities dedicated to sharing images, videos, gifs and/or music.  These are pretty self explanatory.\n\n* r/hiphopheads\n* r/videos\n* r/pics\n* r/memes\n* r/photoshopbattles\n* r/gaming\n* many NSFW communities \n\n**News** \\- communities for the discussion of what’s topical and new in a given content topic. Lots of links. Lots of discussion on those links. \n\n* r/Games\n* r/politics\n* r/apple\n* r/Android\n* r/Bitcoin\n* r/science\n\n**Local** \\- dedicated to a place or an event. Lots of link sharing, discussions, and use of media \\(video, images\\) to share experiences. \n\n* r/Coachella\n* r/nyc\n* r/sanfrancisco\n* r/berkeley \n\n**Dating/friendship** \\- designed to help redditors meet eachother\n\n* r/r4r and regional variants like r/SFr4r or r/SoCalR4R\n* r/penpals\n* r/Needafriend\n\n**Stories** \\- a place where people share stories, fiction and non\\-fiction. Many posts are just prompts and the real content is in the comments. \n\n* r/WritingPrompts\n* r/AskReddit\n* r/AskLEO\n* r/IAmA\n* r/AskHistorians\n* r/tifu\n\n**Commerce** \\- communities dedicated to real life commerce of digital and physical goods. Sometimes redditors buy from eachother, sometimes they congregate info about buying things elsewhere online. \n\n* r/gameswap\n* r/Watchexchange\n* r/RocketLeagueExchange\n* r/sneakermarket\n* r/frugalmalefashion\n\nAll of these archetypes are easy to identify, they have subreddit settings in common that enable each type \\(ie: stories subreddits are only text posts, automod removes all body text from posts so they are title only\\). When we look, behavior across the archetypes is very different and behavior within each archetype very similar. \n\nThere is crossover between topics and archetypes. Any given topic like “Video Games” or “Fashion” or “Beauty” can have subs of many archetypes. r/gaming is a Media type subreddit where users share memes and screen caps from games. r/Games is a News type where users share links and industry news discussion. r/gameswap is a Commerce type subreddit where people trade games. There’s even a gaming Dating/Friendship type subreddit called r/GamerPals. \n\nThis is a new area of investigation and research for us, and it has really honed our thinking about how best to support Reddit. I'd love to get the conversation going with you all in r/TheoryOfReddit about these archetypes.\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex\n\nedit: Formatting for bullets",

These accounts are easy to make in large volumes, and rarely arouse suspicion. This isn’t true for every case, but it applies to many of these bots.\n\n**3: Search for odd activity.**\nMost bot accounts have been “Fermented” by their creators. The accounts are usually between 2-6 years old (But can be younger or older), and have only become active recently. Some bots are simply regular users whose accounts were either compromised or given away, although these are rare. As said before, they usually repost popular posts AND comments. Search for accounts with a long period of inactivity followed by a flood of content. Another giveaway that an account may be a bot; they either rarely or never comment on their own posts.\n\n**4: Report unusual users to the Admins.**\nThe admins are very helpful when it comes to dealing with suspicious accounts. They catch a lot of them, but some inevitably slip through. When you report an account, they will normally be assessed and/or dealt with within a day.",

I recently started working on a real-time dashboard to examine Reddit activity in real-time.  The link above goes to that.\n\nThere are several graphs here:\n\nThe first three graphs show Reddit comment and submission activity in real-time.  The third graph (hour graph) is still filling because I'm using Redis to help offload stress from the database and elasticsearch to be able to handle several thousand hits per second to the dashboard if necessary.\n\nThe next graph shows Subreddit Activity for the previous 10,000 comments.  It basically shows which subreddits are most active based on where comments are being made.\n\nThe Author Comment Activity graph shows which authors are making the most comments (across the past 10,000 comments).\n\nThe next graph shows which author's are currently making the most posts to Reddit.  \n\nThe next graph shows the most popular discussions on Reddit.  This is using machine learning and is still training (it will take a while to get just right).  \n\nI'm working on some dataviz to show which submissions are most active based on comment volume. \n\nSome interesting obversations:\n\n1)  Automoderator appears to remove over 1% of all reddit comments immediately.  It also adds around .75% to the total comment volume.\n\n2)  Submissions appear to be more bot driven than comments.  At night, comments will have a sharper fall-off than submissions.  The only thing that I can think of that would most likely cause this is from bots making submissions during the late night.  I can verify this with some more digging into the data.\n\nIf you all have any suggestions for real-time data visualizations, please feel free to suggest some!\n\nKeep in mind that this page is basically still \"alpha\" and may have some kinks to work out.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nAs for the most popular discussions on Reddit, there is a lot of room for improvement.  Identifying the largest bots and excluding them from analysis, removing certain subreddits that \"pollute\" the results, etc.  If you have any ideas, please feel free to suggest anything.  Let's have an open discussion about this!\n",

        "text": "My suggestion:\n\nSubreddits can choose between different voting systems depending on the nature of their content.\n\nFor example:\n\nA post starts at 0 points. Users then vote in either of three selections:\n\n* Upvote - they like the content\n\n* Neutral - they neither like nor dislike the content.\n\n* Downvote - they dislike the content\n\nThis system takes into account two things: How quickly a post is being voted on (regardless of which type of vote), and the proportions of each type of vote to the other types.\n\nIf the proportion of upvotes to the other two types is higher, and the post is more quickly voted upon than other posts, it ranks higher on the subreddit. If it is the same thing, but instead more in proportion of the neutral vote, posts with comments being posted at a quicker rate rank higher (regardless of how many comments the post has in total)\n\nSubreddits with other types of content where this system may not be suitable could then instead switch to different voting systems, for example, perhaps one that puts newer posts at the top regardless of their votes, or other systems.\n\nMy suggestion for a new karma system:\n\nIt is a single combined number, not one for posts and one for comments. Users gain more points based equally on two factors: How frequently they post and comment, and upvotes. Users who rarely interact on reddit, but tend to have posts with a higher number of upvotes, are rewarded *less* than users who may not have as many upvotes but nonetheless interact on reddit more. Additionally, your points score decays over time (to ensure you don't just have a high score and stop interacting), based on an AI algorithm that tunes your score just for you. I'm unsure if this can be scaled up for millions of users though, it could be say, a small algorithm whose internal values are tuned by the admins, the algorithm is trained, and then only very few factors need to be adjusted for each user?\n\nThe main problem with this suggestion is that it may encourage addiction to reddit. Perhaps, something might be done similar to that recent YouTube feature, where when you watch too many videos a popup shows and tells you to rest for a while?",

        "text": "Hey y’all,\n\nYesterday [a comment thread popped out in /r/gadgets](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/8k3czx/googles_entire_nest_ecosystem_of_smart_home/dz4hb9r/) with people discussing some of the stuff we’ve been doing to the home feed, and I realized we haven’t talked at all about the experiments we’ve been doing lately.  TheoryOfReddit has been one of my favorite subreddits since long before I joined reddit, and a lot of the employees here watch it obsessively, so I figured it’d be a great place to drop this.\n\nFirst, a bit of background.  I’m just going to drop the initial email that I circulated internally before we ran some experiments \\(with some stuff removed that makes no sense without context\\), and then I’ll tell you about the experiments we’ve been running.  This is lengthy, but I hope it’s an enjoyable read.\n\nFor definition, when we refer to **first pass ranker** below, we are referring to the first step in a multi\\-step process for building the feed.  In the first step, we grab a huge pool of candidate links that we will potentially show the user, and in second pass phases, we re\\-rank based on additional signals we have available, such as what a user has interacted with recently.\n\nHere's the email:\n\n&gt;Hey yall,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I've been wanting to do this for a while now and decided to whip something up this evening.  I took a list of my subscriptions \\(around 180 subscriptions\\) and generated normalized hot distributions for each and graphed them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A Background on Normalized Hot AKA Our First Pass Ranker**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In case you're not familiar with normalized hot, you can think of it as taking into account the number of votes there are on a post as well as the age of the post.  For each subreddit, there is a listing of posts with raw hot scores that you'll never see.  For the most part, these raw scores aren't used for ranking; if they were, large subreddits like askreddit would end up dominating your feed.  Instead, we normalized each subreddit's feed by *the hot score for the top item in that listing*.  This means after normalization, the top item will always have a normalized score of 1.  This means there is always an N\\-way tie for the first position item, where N is your number of subscriptions.  To break that tie, we use the raw, unnormalized hot score.  For the rest of the items, we simply rank the remainder by their normalized scores.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Problem / Hypothesis**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have listings for every subreddit.  It's really unlikely that their hot distributions would look the exact same.  This could greatly affect the way items are chosen for your feed and could be the reason why you don't see some of your favorite subreddits very often.  So let's try taking a look at the distributions and see how different they are.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://i.imgur.com/8b2Idrc.png](https://i.imgur.com/8b2Idrc.png)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Each line is a different subreddit.  You can see how the shape of the lines differs drastically.  The line nature of this plot buries some important information, however, so here's a couple of scatter plots.  The second is the same as the first but just zoomed into the upper left corner \\(which is the most important section for generating your home feed\\):  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://i.imgur.com/FtMhmNB.png](https://i.imgur.com/FtMhmNB.png)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://i.imgur.com/lXscFF2.png](https://i.imgur.com/lXscFF2.png)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Each dot shows an individual post.  For generating your feed, you can imagine sliding a horizontally\\-oriented ruler from the top of the graph to the bottom.  Whenever the ruler hits a dot, that item is chosen next for your feed.  The more bent to the top the line is, the more items from that subreddit will show in your feed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Summary**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We could probably re\\-carve the items from our ranker more intelligently without too much work.  Right now we're just sliding that ruler down as the user paginates.  We could start to look at things like a user's recent interactions, whether a subscription is new, and the historical trends for a subreddit \\(i.e. whether the items on the subreddit's listing represent an unusual departure from their norms, either high or low\\).\n\n**The Experiments**\n\nSo I alluded to a few initial ideas we wanted to test.  Here’s what we came up with that we’ve already run:\n\n**Filtering Low Hot Scores**\n\nFor this experiment, we took the top hot score in a user's candidate list, picked a threshold that is some distance from the top, and filtered out any posts that do not meet that threshold.  After some detailed analysis \\(which I haven’t included for the sake of this post not becoming a novel\\), the plan was to only release this for users with more than 10 subscriptions.  After we ran the experiment, this turned out to be pretty bad for users even up to 15 or 20 subscriptions or so.  At 55\\+ subscriptions, however, we started to see some real improvement in time on site, so we decided to re\\-run the experiment while limiting it to users with more than 55 subscriptions.\n\nThe idea here was for users with a lot of subscriptions, we want to start to carve out and remove that middle\\-ground stuff that hits in pages 2\\+ where the normalization is boosting really low\\-activity, low\\-upvote subreddits.  When I tried this out on my feed, it really made a huge difference.  It’s a bit tricky to identify where it will be most useful though, so if we decide to use some form of this, we need to figure out a way to identify users with the subreddit distributions where it’ll be most effective.\n\n**Raw Hot Scores**\n\nFor this experiment, we generated a feed based entirely on the raw hot score, no per\\-subreddit normalization.  This was intended to be a knowledge\\-gathering experiment since we’d probably never launch anything in that exact state.  In an ideal world, this would give us some quick numbers on the upper limit of what we could get out of our first pass ranker with no new signal captured.\n\nI honestly thought this one would be like jet fuel, but it ended up having problems similar to the filtering low hot experiment.  We’ve re\\-released it to users with \\&gt;55 subscriptions to see how it goes.\n\n**Anomalously Hot Posts**\n\nThis experiment is actually broken into quite a few variations, but the gist of it is this: we try to look for trends in the hot score and look for posts that are anomalously high.  When we find them, we boost them higher in the feed.  This should help bring up things that are trending, like news, but it also would help the problem I mentioned above, where posts that are otherwise low quality end up being treated the same as ones that are actually a lot higher than usual for a subreddit.\n\nWe have 4 different variations of this experiment out right now based on a number of different decay factors of the hot score \\(1 hour, 3 hour, 6 hour, and 12.5 hour\\).  There was an initial low\\-hanging\\-fruit approach we tried that was based on the way we do push notifications that didn’t end up working very well for the feed, so this is our second iteration.  Initial results are looking pretty good, but we don’t want to count our chickens before they hatch.\n\nFeel free to drop any questions in the comments, and I’ll try to answer them as I can.  u/daftmon will be around too, so if there's anything here you hate feel free to ping him instead of me.\n\nDan",

I hate karma whores as much as the next guy but randomaccount42069 complaining about their (-2) “downvotes for my opinion, really?” make me furious for some stupid reason. \n\nIn my fantasy land I’d try to solve this by making accounts auto-lock after a short period of time. Maybe 24 hours. Maybe a few days. And maybe, just maybe, people would care a little less about votes. Maybe if accounts were “worth” less, people wouldn’t care so much about collecting +1s from randoms. \n\nOr maybe it would still be a dumpster fire in new and inventive ways. \n\nIts just frustrating how much people care about internet points. Hoarding them or losing them or intentionally losing them. \n\nI like that generally interesting stuff gets upvoted and sometimes genuinely interesting and helpful comments get set apart with upvotes, but there’s a side to it I’m not over the moon about. \n\nSorry for the rant and how the hell was this username not taken this far into this sites existence? You would think a shitty novelty account would have taken this years ago. I’m glad I’m using it as a throwaway. \n",

Since people can subscribe to over 200+ subreddits, instead of Reddit showing you a post from each one it chooses a random list of 50 or so subreddit and shows you posts from them. Every half hour or so it chooses 50 different random subreddits. \n\nOr atleast thats how it used to work. In the past, whenever I visited Reddit.com, my frontpage was filled with a completely random selection of the various subreddits I subscribed to over  the years.\n\nRecently, however, I have noticed that it seems like Reddit is keeping track of what subreddits you are visiting and showing you more of those algorithmically. It is no longer random. For example, if I visit the /r/yugioh subreddit out of the blue and spend some time on it, for the next week, /r/yugioh will always be in my list of 50 subreddits for the frontpage, especially if I reinforce it by revisiting it every time it shows up. \n\nIs this a known change that has been announced somewhere?",
