I graduated high school in 2018 and went to university in Canada to study economics but ended up almost killing myself!\n\nI've worked an insane amount to become the healthiest mentally I've ever been and now I'm starting university again officially tommorow.\n\nI know any engineering major is very difficult and I've heard from multiple faculty members that students in my ECE program usually take longer than 4 years due to the amount of work needed. \n\nI was hoping to get off to a fresh start so I had a few questions. \n\n1.) I have very very basic / almost no experience in coding. I know the barebones of python. I know this isn't the best case scenario but I'm willing to put in the work and I was wondering if I should take a C++ course and work on it outside my lectures. \n\n2.) As someone with no relavent experience in the field around when should I be looking to apply for internships? \n\n3.) I know the field of CE is very large, should I be trying to focus on one area of specialization already from my freshmen year? Like the concept of AI and ML seems attractive and the chair of my department seems to think it's a field that will grow in the upcoming years. Even if I don't start projects or whatever, should I be trying to self teach ML courses? I honestly have no idea what I want to specialize in\n\n4.) Orientation was honestly fucking torture. Playing around with kids almost 4-5 years younger than me.. I have a ton of life experience over these kids but because of my age (I was born 1999) I really don't wanna fail... Again. I've worked blue collar jobs and I know how blessed I am to be given another opportunity at higher education. If anyone can throw me some words of wisdom for a fresh engineering student I'd greatly appreciate it. \n\n\nThank you for reading my long ass post!",

I need a community, something, that keeps me on track, gives me idea, insights. I've tried discord servers, but I feel em quite dispersive cause there's lot of people, there isn't a \"theme\". \n\nBtw, I'm 32yo, finishing my BSc (I know, little bit late), I'm doing the final thesis on RF waveguides components for linear accelerators (riblet short slot coupler, I'm studying multipaction on it) and my main interests are:\n\n- discrete electronics (I would like starting designing something, from idea to schematic to PCB, maybe stuff like guitar pedals (distortion, reverb, delay, stuff like that), or embedded projects with micros, etc)\n\n- RF and antennas (obviously, I'm doing thesis on RF). I want to understand if this can be a interest of mine. I don't really love doing EM simulations, even if I'm doing just that for thesis. I hate the \"mechanical\" CAD part I think. Maybe PCB RF is more fun. Or integrated RF. \n\n- Analog integrated electronics (maybe...). I've done some classes in microelectronics. Designed some basic OTA, current mirrors, a Gm-C voltage controlled filter. But I want to understand if this is something that can suites me or not.. \n\n- System level design, using Simulink. Quite hate Matlab as a language, but I really really love what you can do with simulink. \n\nThis is my LinkedIn and GitHub profile.\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-caterina-b7a4ab83\nhttps://github.com/FraH90\n\n\nAnd now.. it's your turn. \nEveryone's welcome, students, professional, I'd like to build a community of like minded people (with a little touch of entrepreneurial attitude too). \n\nLet me know if you're interested, and how we could arrange for creating the group.",

        "author": "GeorgeneKeck",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/115fpif/what_is_your_preferred_netlist_syntax/",
        "text": "Hey. I'm writing a circuit simulator. I decided to write the netlist lexter before implementing the stamps because I already have MNA taken care of but I know I will have to change the fundamentals a lot so writing the parser beforehand helps in testing and debugging. It's in Rust btw. So the netlist syntax I've come up with is this (by the way my usual variable naming is not this crappy I'm just doing this to emphasize which part is a dynamic lexeme and which part is an identifier):\n\n**TL;DR**: Do you like the following syntax for a circuit simulator netlist?\n\n```\n;circuitName123 -author=JohnnieRad -date=10March2023 -profile=profileLinear123 -profile=profileDNln\n;;myCapNode -in=vcc -out=$PROBE -cross_parallel=myResistor1 -cross_parallel=Resistor2\n;;;profileLinear123 .capacitor -capacitance=22n\n;;;profileDNln       .capacitor -capacitance=22u -dynamic -nonlinear\n;;myResistor1 -in=ground -parallel=myRessitor2\n;;;profileLinear123 .resistor -resistance=2k\n;;;profilDNln -resistor -resistance=22k -nonlinear\n;;myResistor2 -in=ground -parallel=myResistor1\n;;;profileLinear123 .resistor -resistance=2k\n;end\n```\nSo you may have noticed this already but the circuit is this: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter#/media/File:High_pass_filter.svg\n\nExcept with two parallel resistors with profile `profileLinear123` and one variable resistor, maybe a photoresistor or a thermistor etc, with profile profileDln.\n       \nThe capacitor in profile 1 is a normal cap, maybe ceramic, but the cap in the second one is maybe an electrolytic cap.\n\n`$PROBE` means this is where what the current circuit outputs, basically where the supposed probes are. This circuit simulator only does transient, DC and AC analysis and it does not have features that Falstad has such as a nice GUI where you can put the probe anywhere and it will basically act like any metric device. It also lacks all the SPICE-like analytic features.\n\nTo write it I have read 3 books, one from back to back, and if you want the name of those books just ask because some only can be found on the Gen and are extremely out of print. I also read the MNA paper.\n\nI refrained from using SPICE-like netlists because they are simply not readable. From day one SPICE netlists were used as an inbetween between the Sun, Unix and later Windows CAD UI systems and the application. They were never meant to be readable or writable, just easy to parse. This one is not easy to parse. But I'm trying my best, reading all the books I can for which I cannot find any good ones for Rust. I can hack and use C methods mentioned in Compiler Design 4ed but why, it's easier to use C then than a more modern language right.\n\nAnyways I would like to see if you like this netlist syntax. Not just to use it just the schematics of it all, how it looks, etc. If you like another order, different tokens for certain idents, etc, just tell me because i want people to use this simulator even for once.\n\nI would also like to hear a way to fit in MTEs. Currently it does TTEs, that is, triterminal transistors both BJTs and MOSFETs (MOSFETs and FETs got the same stamp I believe). OpAmps, too, are TTEs that I can include. But with MTEs it's kinda hard to define them. Usually with TTEs simulator designers write intricate netlists that people can include in their main netlists. I would like to know what logistics you would use. MTEs are a later version concern though.\n\nIf anyone is interested in knowing how a simulator works, I can explain. I will be happy to I just don't want to add more to this parchment of a post. Thanks.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I am new to this forum and I have been reading some of your posts. Let me explain myself\n\nI've been doing a lot of Circuit Design / PCB Layout for the past year, my main goal was to learn and keep learning until being able to create a Single Board Computer (Which I just did and is on manufacturing right now). I usually handle from concept, to schematics, to PCB layout and then manufacturing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately, I've been feeling like I am getting close to a ceiling on my knowledge regarding PCB Design, me personally I am not interested on doing PCB Layout for small MCU boards because anyone could probably do those. I've been leaning more into High-speed digital layout (DDR4 SDRAM, PCIe, USB) and even into some RF design (I've used Ansys HFSS and Cadence ADS).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been wondering, where should I take my career now? For the moment being I would be happy designing one or two more Single Board Computers. But I've been reading PCB Layout is often considered more like tech work and not so much engineering. And I kind of agree, I mean it isn't very easy, but it isn't too hard either. I don't think going into higher layer counts will make it much more complicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you think about other career paths? I've heard about SI/PI engineering, I am very well informed of SI/PI, but what's a SI/PI engineer? What do they usually do to warrant a entirely different role? I know they probably use more simulation software like Hyperlink\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been learning about FPGAs on my spare time, I would say my dream job at the moment would be ASIC design, or digital IC design. I was very passionate about continous/discrete signal processing during my college years, I still have some books on the matter, Resonance, FT/HT, Z-Transform, all that. I really liked that stuff, I still study it on my spare time although I haven't had much chance to use it on my PCB Design jobs (But I will say knowing all those mathematics really helped me form a strong intuition very quickly). Will I use more of that doing Analog IC design? Maybe even doing some custom DSP IC? That's something I would really look forwards too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also into some RF Design, I've done RF layouts on some of my boards, Smith chart, Impedance matching, I have my own VNA, I have done many Cadence ADS simulations to tune impedance. It's not something I am an expert on but I have grasped some of it \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think learning FPGAs is the best way to get into Digital IC design? I've heard Verilog is used on some Open Source IC toolchains. And what would be the best way to get into Analog IC Design?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a more niche, harder and specialized career path inside PCB Layout? RF Design? SI/PI Engineer? Is it worth it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a decent amount of money savings and money income even without my engineering work, I can quit completely for some months to dedicate to study.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny question regarding some of my experience and current knowledge, I will be glad to answer. Thanks for your time reading this post and I hope to hear from you on the comments",

Doing calculations on a calculator, such as Casio, doesn't help. Manually doing it on a calculator is error prone and very time consuming. What's the way to make it automated where you input the values for any of those four variables and get the value for the fifth variable.\n\nOne can, perhaps, write a MATLAB with all the formulas and then copy/paste the required formula to do the calculation. Or, perhaps Wolfram Alpha. I haven't tried these two methods but I think one would need to re-arrange the formula in order to calculate any variable other than \"X\". For example, to find \"A\", one would be required to re-arrange the formula to put \"A\" on the left side.\n\nWhat do you suggest? How  can I make it 'automated'? \n\nThanks for your time!",

        "text": "Good they \\[sic\\]. I am writing a circuit simulator. The reasoning is, I am a systems programmer and have been for years. I wanted to break into electronics and \\[simple\\] system design, and embedded programming and design. People are not as willing to let a complete stranger with nothing to show into the field. I got money from my systems programming job and I have bought all the equipment and components that I could. I even bought a function generator and leaned a lot from it using my OScope. But I felt like I am lite on theory so I decided to write this circuit simulator. \n\nThe language I am doing it in is Rust. I am currently working on the parser for the netlist. I read 3 textbooks to learn how to do this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElectronic Engineering Systems) Jan Ogrodzki - Circuit Simulation Methods and Algorithms-CRC Press (1994).\n\nFarid N. Najm - Circuit Simulation-Wiley-IEEE Press (2010)\n\nLawrence T. Pillage, Ronald A. Rohrer, Chandramouli Visweswariah - Electronic Circuit and System Simulation Methods-Mcgraw-Hill (Tx) (1994)\n\nThe book by Najm was the most informative and easy to understand, but lacked info on AC simulation. But the book from 1994 was much better in both algorithms regard and AC simulation regard. Najm contains everything you need to know about DC and transient.\n\nI am not going to share the link to the repo, because it's in a bad shape currently, I have bipolarity and I have been rather depressed for the past few days and I have not been able to tend to my libre/FOSS projects and right now I trauma dumped on my boss hey I'm trauma dumping now whatever. So long story short it's in bad shape. But if yo ureally want to see it and give me some pointers, PM me. \n\nI am currently working on making a readable, MNAble circuit from the netlist. I have noticed all the netlists are extremely unreadable because most simulators have got GUIs. Falstad beats everyone to the punch in this regard as it has a portable, beautiful, awesome GUI and my simulator will not be even useful for people when NGSpice, LTSpice and Falstad exist. I just wanna learn. That's all..\n\nSo why am I making this thread? If I would stop freaking procrastinating and whining to my boss about why a Croatian transphobe has said there will be a civil war in my county I will finish the parsing and lexing soon and will move on to stamps .I have already finished the solvers. I have implemented a column-parallel LU Factorization solver for linear algebraic systems,  i have implemented both Jacobi and Seidel for people who wanna go the iteraitve route, and I have implemented the Newton iteration but I will probably have to rewrite it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the Newton iteration I need the stamp of all components, biterminal and triterminal. Najm provides them in his book but they are not in one place and I don't know why the editor of the book has not collected them all in one place as reference material. Najm's book is more targeted towards idiots like me and Ihat's why this book was the one who taught me most. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I do have all the stamps but it would be awesome if I had them all in ONE PLACE right? Instead of fervently going through the se books to find the stamp I can just look at them. It would be even better if the stamps are already in a programming language, best of them would be Python because Python is extremely readable and adoptable in all languages. If you give them to me in Java I swear I will beat you up because I hate Java. Jk Java is ok too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I need the elemental stamps that are used in SPICE-like simulators in one place, prefreably with bit of an explanation, any form is good, HTML, PDF, slide, text docment, anything short of a 1200s codex written by an Khawrazmid scholar escaping from Mongol invasion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot.",

When I use any of the non core-coupled GPIO ports, I'm finding that, from the cpu, I have a maximum output toggling frequency (meaning positive and negative edge) around 8MHz (so, ~16MHz effective port frequency) for normal GPIO ports and a little over 5MHz for the low power (LPSR) ports. This is roughly *half* that of an old 250MHz Coldfire I've used in the past, hell there are M0+'s that have fast GPIO performance than that.\n\nI understand that the speed will be dependent on the bus frequency feeding the peripherals, but that's running at ~200MHz, so why is it so ungodly slow? I've tried playing games with the MPU to set it as Strongly Ordered memory instead of Device, but that doesn't seem to have any effect, and inserting synchronization barriers slows down the rate even further, so it's not a pipeline triggered issue it would seem.\n\nHow bad is the AXI bus for singular read/writes? Is there a way to configure the NIC to say \"Yes, I understand that you may not be finished with this transaction, but let me get back to my thing so I can feed you more transactions later\"? Does this even make sense? Basically, by my understanding here, that would put the total transaction latency from CPU write to GPIO change at ~12 cycles of the AHB for the normal GPIO ports and ~20 cycles for the LPSR, and an cpu latency of 50 and 80 cycles respectively.\n\nWhat don't I understand here? It's not like NXP's publishing block diagrams that demonstrate the bus structure in the least...",

The probable solutions I can think of are BLE+Cellular or Lora+cellular. I have been trying to read up about ultra wide band (UWB) but unable to get a dev kit to work with it. Please provide suggestions as to what would make up for a low power asset tracking solution for this use case. Its for a hobby project where I also intend to learn cloud integration. Any information about cloud integration would be helpful too. Thank you!",

DSP, telecoms and machine learning have more been my focus during my bachelors.

However, DSP is another field I am very interested in and which I have a solid background/foundation in it (+ some FPGA and SW, MatLab programming) through different electives, mini-jobs etc. My concern is that, if I want to go into a DSP and more programming related field would doing a Master's program focused on micro/nanoelectronics hinder my career or throw me behind as an applicant to DSP related jobs?",

Its mostly superficial knowledge though.\n\nI'm mainly asking this because I feel like most schools require their students to take digital circuits as a core requirement.\n\nAlso, as an additional question, I have the option of taking one more EE course, what would you recommend to be the most essential as an electrical engineer to have taken?:\n\nApplied Electromagnetics, Electronics 2 (focused more on analog circuits, amplifiers w/ BJTs, CMOS, differential op amps, current mirrors, etc.), or Digital Circuits 1?\n\nThanks, and if this isn't the right sub for this i'll take it down.",

So I am either looking to work remotely or to work in a company where commute can be easy (so I can have a work-life balance since it is impossible waking up at 7:30 am and arriving home at 9:30 pm) and the office is not as atrocious so I can have some peace to work (the noise gives me such an headache and I can't get anything done)...\n\nThere must be something out there.\n\nThank you!",

I have LTspice and a spice through Altium Designer.\n\nI would greatly appreciate and willing to even compensate if someone could walk me through the steps of doing the analysis and properly using spice.

For example, the maximum output voltage I have computed is 2.8 volts, while the minimum is 0.7 volts. The DC output voltage is 1.5 volts, so it is understood that it is the value at the middle of the output swing. However, 2.8 and 0.7 have varying voltage differences from that 1.5, may I ask if that is possible? Thank you!",

This is an non inverting amplifier because the source(a messy convoluted source) is connected to non inverting terminal .So we can find this by KCL (current entering the non inverting terminal is zero ) and Node voltage method .Here the input voltage is taken to be Vi=Vq.My question is that in previous problem we seemed to take the input voltage as V_i=V_C - V_A .But here we have just considered V_i =V_q.\n\nAnother question unrelated to opamp .\n\nHow do i do this problem .\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AVHXZFD\n\nShould I find the current across each diode before determining whether the diodes are on/off .How do i do that ?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I am a Masters student in Germany currently in the communications track which has courses focused on signal processing, RF, circuit design, networks and a bit of data analysis, optimization etc. There is a different track on micro/nanoelectronics which focuses solely on solid state physics, semiconductor devices, their characterization and again circuits as well. In summary less programming and statistics but more physics. After making the big mistake of having zero work experience before Masters, this has led me to countless existential thoughts while trying to decide on what I wanna do next and what to focus on. Therefore, I am asking you to give me an insight to the industries these two tracks focus on. Job oppurtunities, pay, working environment, people and most importantly the work itself and how interesting, innovative and thought provoking it is. Before you say I should go into what I like, I have to mention that I very much like all areas I mentioned. However, hardcore physics I find especially interesting and thought provoking but my background in quantum and solid state physics is very very minimal compared to signal processing and communications. This leads me to a dilemna where mystery of the unknown intrigues me but what I am already confident at is my comfort zone. I would really appreciate any thoughts you would have or decisions you would make if you were in my place. Thank you all in advance.",

Its not bad, it pays well but we are working on a  project that's as old as me and all the tools we use are outdated. My  day consists of processing customer cases and debugging java code  mostly. I write fixes from time to time but not a lot of development. I  want to continue learning new things on my own since I feel like the  things I learn on my job are not applicable elsewhere. I know for most  people where they work doesn't matter as long as their colleagues are  cool and they get nice salary but I feel like I don't care about the  salary as much as the company. I want to work on something innovative  for example in the space industry. There are so many things one can  learn and I don't know what to spend my time learning. AI, blockchain,  embedded, devops, game development they all seem interesting but I don't  know what I want to invest time learning. And will any these paths be  needed in the future or it will be impossible to find a job. Will  programming become obsolete? With recent AI advancements I'm not even  sure if I should spend time going deeper. I'll be happy if you could  give me some advice and point of view. Any \"future proof\" skills that  will be needed even if AI takes the job of writing the code?",
