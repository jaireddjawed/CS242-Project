The space debris crashed through her roof and struck the left side of her body. It was the first known instance of a human being hit by a meteorite and suffering an injury.\n\nThe meteorite that struck Hodges was one-half of a larger rock that split in two as it fell toward Earth. The piece that did not hit Hodges landed a few miles away and is now in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History collections.\n\nTo this day, Ann Hodges remains the only human to be hit by a meteorite and who survived to tell her tale.\n\nRead more about this strange quirk of history...\n\n[https://owlcation.com/humanities/Ann-Hodges-History-Only-Known-Meteorite-Victim](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Ann-Hodges-History-Only-Known-Meteorite-Victim)",

I have written and drawn in a notebook and a half of my trio of notebooks named The ARCs (Astronomical Rocketry Compendiums). I have gone back and forth on what I want to do as my job, but they always surround the space industry. Currently, I want to become an astrophysicist, astronaut, or aerospace engineer. I have always wanted to live in space, even if it's just for a while, which is why the astronaut profession is intriguing. But I've also always wanted to build spacecrafts and learn about the cosmos. If anyone stumbles upon this and has any of these jobs, can you please tell me the pros and cons, any advice on the jobs, and how you got the job? Also, remember my name because when I'm an adult, I'll be in the big leagues.\n       \n                 - Thank you and salutations\n                                  WC Braxton",
