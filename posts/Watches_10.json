        "text": "I never thought I would own a gold watch but this has made me re think that. I now understand they hype cause this punches way above its price point. The bracelet was so comfortable and it looks so good. I really haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about the watch since I left the store. So I might need to let go of some stuff to fund this. \n\nI asked the AD regarding the rumors about an automatic 35 mm being released this year. And he hasn‚Äôt heard anything about it. He also said that it would require a whole new movement if they don‚Äôt use old one from one of their ladies watches. But according to him those movements aren‚Äôt that good or reliable. It would also mean that the watch case would become thicker.",

It has been exactly one year since my purchase, and I would like to write some thoughts on this anniversary both as a personal record and as a potentially useful reference for any potential buyers.\n\nThings I like a lot about the BB GMT:\n\n\\-Love the Black Bay line dial design, details, and the signature snowflake hour hand. Differentiation of shapes of different hands make telling time rather easily during normal lighting (but there is a catch, see below for details). \n\n\\-COSC movement keeps solid time, screw-down crown is huge and easy to operate, and the water resistance has withstood the test of my summer trip back to my hometown in the tropical seaside area of Asia.  \n\n\\-The dial size of 41mm hit the sweet spot for me and should satisfy a wide range of wrist size. Lug-to-lug is close to 50mm and could be a bit big for some, but the lug tips do curve down nicely and makes the watch sit rather comfortably on the wrist top. \n\n\\-The Pepsi GMT bezel has a smooth clicking turn, and it does come in handy when you have to track time in multiple time zones. Last November I had an international business trip that required me to track time across three different time zones in three different continents, and I fully enjoyed using the Pepsi bezel and the true GMT movement to their intended purpose. Also, compared with the Prussian blue/darker blue Pepsi on the Rolex GMT Master II‚Äôs polished Pepsi, BB GMT‚Äôs dull Pepsi has this subtle dark pine green/iron gray color on the darker half which in my opinion gives the watch a less blingy and more refined appearance.\n\nSome Issues Worth Discussing: \n\n\\-Lume is sufficient, but not great. Exposed to a typical day of sunlight and indoor lighting, the lume still fades to minimal after about 20-25 minutes in pitch black. It could make telling time challenging at night, especially when some hands overlap and you have to rely on the lume to differentiate the shapes of different hands. \n\n\\-Weight and thickness may be the two most frequently debated issues of this watch. Now, my BB GMT is on NATO strap, only because during the time of my purchase the demand was so huge that the only model left in the AD was the NATO strap version. Looking back, I‚Äôd say I accidentally made the right decision because the feather weight NATO strap undermined the weight and the thickness rather significantly. I once met a watch fan who said he traded in his steel bracelet BB GMT for a steel bracelet BB Pro after less than a year of use, simply because the more compact profile of the BB Pro felt more comfortable despite having its own weight and thickness issues. \n\nIn terms of thickness, the domed sapphire crystal and the sealed case back each takes up about 1mm of thickness, so the ‚Äútrue‚Äù thickness of the case is approximately 13-13.5mm, but it still presents a challenge if you want to tug this watch under any sleeve. Weight, on the other hand, has little remedy. I do feel the watch on my wrist all the time, and for the first few months of ownership it did occasionally intrude into the area of my wrist knuckle bone. It takes some time to get used to the weight and thickness. \n\nComparison with competitor:\n\nTo date, the only watch comparable on all factors (entry-level luxury price, true GMT movement, dial size, major brand name etc) seems to be the Longines Spirit Zulu Time. I thought about buying the SZT but eventually decided against it, as the two watch overlaps so much that owning one is sufficient. I did try the SZT on my wrist several times. In terms of wear, the SZT has a lighter weight, 1mm less of thickness, and the leather strap adheres to the wrist quite comfortably. I‚Äôve also heard good things about the lume. On the other hand, the dial of the SZT is 1mm larger than the BB GMT, while the lugs are rather big (despite having a smaller lug-to-lug as the BB GMT) and does not curve down as significantly as the BB GMT. Thus, at a glance the SZT could appear to cover a larger portion of the wrist than the BB GMT. Unless one has a strong preference between the aesthetics of a pilot‚Äôs watch and a diver‚Äôs watch, these two watches are so on a par with each other that I would recommend anyone wanting to buy one to try the other for a side-by-side comparison. \n\nOverall: \n\nWhether you treat it as ‚Äúthe poor man‚Äôs Rolex GMT Master II‚Äù or a stand-alone watch, the Tudor Black Bay GMT is a solid watch and there is a lot to love about it. That said, the weight and the thickness may or may not work for different individuals, and I highly recommend anyone considering this watch to try it on different straps and bracelets to see if it works for you.",

        "text": "It's Tuesday and not much is happening. However, the new Bremont looks amazing!\n\n# What's new\n\n[**Bremont Broadsword Recon Is a Limited Edition Addition to their Armed Forces Collection**](https://www.fratellowatches.com/the-new-limited-edition-bremont-broadsword-recon-joins-the-brands-armed-forces-collection/)\n\n/ Today Bremont introduces the Broadsword Recon, which pays tribute to the heritage of the British Ministry of Defense, specifically, His Majesty‚Äôs Armed Forces (HMAF) and their timepieces. The brand claims this is their interpretation of the classic Dirty Dozen watches. This is nothing new, as there is a bunch of brands paying homage to these legendary watches. \n\nWhere Bremont differs is in the details. The Broadsword Recon has a fantastic sandwich dial, only the second in Bremont‚Äôs history, and the cutouts allow the tan-colored trademarked ‚ÄúP51‚Äù Super-LumiNova to shine extremely bright. The watch features matte black hands with the same shade of tan lume. The two-piece hardened steel Broadsword case retains its usual 40mm diameter, 12.5mm thickness, 47mm lug-to-lug, and 20mm lug spacing. Bremont sells the watch on a chunky color-matched NATO strap, and it comes with an extra rubber or leather strap as well. \n\nIt‚Äôs a fine looking watch, and at ‚Ç¨2.985 it‚Äôs very fairly priced. The only downside is the fact they will make only 200 of them.\n\n[**Maurice Lacroix does a slight redesign to the best selling Pontos Day-Date**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-2023-redesigned-maurice-lacroix-pontos-day-date-41mm-collection-specs-price/)\n\n/ After an update to their Pontos chronograph, Maurice Lacroix has now facelifted their Pontos Day-Date 41mm for 2023. Redesigned quite drastically in 2017, the Day-Date model remains one of the bestsellers in the brand‚Äôs collection, and now, Maurice Lacroix releases 3 new dials. \n\nThe case remains the same - 41mm in diameter and 11mm high. The dial so fat was silver-colored with gold plated hands and markers. ML now introduces three new colors with contrast accents - the minute track that is inside the hour track is now painted a contrasting color to the rest of the dial. The available dials are silver with a grey minute track and 4N gold-plated hands and markers, anthracite with 4N gold minute track and hands/markers and a black dial with silver-coloured track and hands/markers. \n\nThe watch is powered by their calibre ML143, a Sellita-sourced movement with 4Hz frequency and 38h power reserve. Each version of the Pontos Day-Date can be chosen either on a faux-alligator leather strap in black, with that gaudy M logo at the 6 o‚Äôclock position, which will match the dial hardware, or a 3-link steel bracelet. Prices will be CHF 1,900 on strap and CHF 1,950 on bracelet.\n\n[**Green is the Watch Color of the Year. So The Fine Watch Club Had Montblanc Make Them a Gorgeous 1858 Iced Sea Limited Edition**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-green-montblanc-1858-iced-sea-limited-edition-fine-watch-club-specs-price/)\n\n/ The Fine Watch Club is an international multi-brand watch club aimed at anyone with an interest in luxury mechanical watches. The Club offers different programs and experiences for Watch Aficionados and, also releases limited-edition watches. Their latest is the Montblanc 1858 Iced Sea with their own twist. \n\nWhile we have seen the green Montblanc 1858 Iced Sea before and think it‚Äôs already fantastic, the FWC added some very different details. Presented in a green colourway, the Fine Watch Club limited edition features a 6-9-23 numeral (with green lume) on its textured dial instead of the 6-9-12 on the regular MB. \n\nEverything else remains the same: 41mm stainless steel case with a unidirectional steel and ceramic bezel, 300m water resistance, the automatic calibre MB 24.17 based on the Sellita SW200-1 and a stainless-steel bracelet (tapering from 20mm to 18mm). The Montblanc 1858 Iced Sea FWC is released in a limited edition of 23 pieces. It retails for CHF 3,295 and will be delivered at Watches and Wonders.\n\n[**The Ollech &amp; Wajs Astrochron S is a Dive Chronograph With a Compass Bezel and Regatta Counter**](https://wornandwound.com/ollech-wajs-astrochron-s-combines-a-500-wr-dive-chronograph-with-a-compass-bezel-and-regatta-counter/)\n\n/ Ollech &amp; Wajs has decided to revisit the design and one glance will confirm that this isn‚Äôt your original 1967 Astrochron. With the new refresh, Ollech &amp; Wajs‚Äô already capable multi-functional chronograph just got, well, more capable. \n\nThe bezel has an elapsed time display, but in this contemporary version of the Astrochron S, we also get a compass scale. The compass portion of the bezel angles downwards towards the bezel‚Äôs grip and uses black markers against a steel background to assist with getting your bearings out in the field. The slimmer and flatter portion of the bezel displays a count-up timer separated into two different tones ‚Äì a white bezel with blue accents providing a 20 minute diver scale and the remaining portion of the bezel using a matte gray color with white accents \n\nIt‚Äôs a thick boy at 16.8mm and 39mm in diameter, but tries justifies that thickness with a 500 meter water resistance and the 5 minute regatta timer at three o‚Äôclock. It‚Äôs powered by the Valjoux 7753, a descendent of the iconic Valjoux 72. It comes on a beads of rice stainless which looks very nicely brushed. \n\nThe Astrochron S is currently available directly through Ollech &amp; Wajs with the first 56 models numbered and retails for $2,737.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\n\n[**Hodinkee wears the Bulgari Octo Finissimo Chronograph GMT for a couple of days**](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/uncomplicating-the-complicated-bulgari-octo-finissimo-chronograph-gmt)\n\n[**A review of the holy grail of Grand Seiko, the Grand Seiko Kodo Constant-force Tourbillon SLGT003**](https://deployant.com/review-the-new-grand-seiko-kodo-constant-force-tourbillon-slgt003/)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n[**Blok Watches make a tough watch specially designed for kids**](https://timeandtidewatches.com/micro-mondays-blok-watches-have-made-a-tough-watch-specially-designed-for-kids/)\n\nThere‚Äôs no shortage of independent watchmakers.
