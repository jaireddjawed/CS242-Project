The first mate went running into the Captain's quarters and said, \"Pirates are attempting to board, Captain. What should we do?\"\n\nThe Captain stood, looked the First Mate right in the eye, and said, \"Prepare the men for battle, and bring me my red shirt!\"\n\nThe First Mate quickly got the Captain's red shirt, which the captain put on. Then he led his crew into battle against the pirates. Although there were some casualties among the crew, the pirates were defeated.\n\nLater that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending two boarding parties towards their ship. first mate went running into the Captain's quarters and said, \"Two pirate ships fast approaching, Captain. What should we do?\"\n\nThe Captain stood, looked the First Mate right in the eye, and said, \"Prepare the men for battle, and bring me my red shirt!\"\n\nOnce again the Captain led the men into battle wearing his red shirt, and once again the pirates were defeated!\n\nWeary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's events. The first mate approached the Captain and said, \"Tell me, Captain. What is it with the red shirt? Is it a magic shirt? How is it we were able to defeat the pirates?\"\n\nThe Captain said, \"Battle is about confidence. If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the blood, so you men will continue to fight unafraid.\" \n\nThe first mate sat in silence thinking, \"What a brilliant man. No wonder he was Captain.\"\n\nAs dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. \n\nThe first mate went running into the Captain's quarters, screaming, \"Captain, Captain, there are ten pirate ships headed our way. WHAT SHOULD WE DO?\"\n\nThe Captain stood, looked the First Mate right in the eye, and said, \"Prepare the men for battle, and bring me my brown pants\"",

One interested party was a man named Thomas Goode, a chemist who had developed a unique new asphalt blend that would endure in hazardous conditions. \n\nAfter seeing his product in action, the mayor said 'This is great stuff! But do you apply it all yourself? There's a lot of road here to cover.\" \n\n\"Oh, no\" said Thomas- \"I can sub-contract and get my wifes' family to help!\" Thomas explained that he had married a woman named Mei Chin, the only daughter of a Chinese family that had settled in the state years ago. Her father, uncles and brothers all worked together in construction and general contracting- currently there were 10 family members working full time. \n\nThomas Goode made several calls and the Chin boys got to work immediately. Several weeks later the work was finished, with the roads looking better than ever. The mayor of Hell called a press conference to announce the projects' completion.\n\n\"Today,\" said the mayor \"I can proudly say that the roads to Hell are paved with Goode and Ten Chins!\"",

The local priest had become so tired of hearing women confess to infidelity,  that he established a code for them: just say you fell in the hole, and I'll know what you mean. As the priest was eager to begin his sabbatical, he neglected to mention this to his young replacement. \n\nThe first day at confession,  Mrs. Johnson came in and said, \"Father, I fell in the hole.\" The young minister said,  \"I find no sin in that.\" \"Oh, thank you, Father! Thank you, thank you!\" He had the same conversations with Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Jones, just about every married woman in the town, over the course of two weeks, always assuring the women that falling into a hole was not a sin. \n\nOne day, the mayor of the town came in, and the young priest reproached him about the hole. The mayor, who obviously knew about the older priest's arrangement,  laughed.\n\n\"You shouldn't laugh, Mr. Mayor! Your own wife has fallen in the hole 3 times this month!\"",
