        "author": "ihateanime6969",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10khops/brokebusy_college_student_year_2_update_passing_n2/",
        "text": "Busy/Broke college student 2 year update: Passing N2!\n\nHi everyone – this is an update post to last year’s post (which you can find \\[here\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/rmcwa4/one\\_year\\_of\\_studying\\_japanese\\_as\\_a\\_busy\\_college/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/rmcwa4/one_year_of_studying_japanese_as_a_busy_college/))). I know post-JLPT there’s a lot of progress posts going around, so let me explain quickly I made one:\n\n1. Like most people on this subreddit, I’m a full time college student, have \\~25 hours a week of work spread over several part-time jobs (why is college tuition so expensive) and run several clubs at my school, so suffice to say I don’t have a lot of free time.\n2. As you may have guessed from part 1, I am also broke, so I have essentially no money to spend on Japanese materials. I also double-major in two STEM classes, so I don’t have access to our school’s Japanese department resources since I need to focus on major requirements.\n\nCurrent Level: So first off, what is my current level? First, my N2 results: [https://imgur.com/a/YCr12hg](https://imgur.com/a/YCr12hg) \n\nI redacted the scores to avoid doxxing myself, but I scored approximately the same on all 3 sections, doing slightly better on language knowledge and slightly worse on listening. I didn’t score as close to full points as I hoped but ended up scoring well above the pass mark, so all in all I’m not too unhappy about my result.\n\nSimilar to last year, my vocab is probably still my strongest area, in practice tests I was able to knock through most N1 vocab tests with ease. My grammar and listening are definitely still weaker. Overall, I’d say my vocab is probably \\~N1 level at this point and my grammar and listening are \\~N2.\n\nUtilizing Downtime: In terms of methods, I continued utilizing many of the methods from last year to squeeze in whatever study I could since I’m pretty busy. The most important thing during the day was utilizing downtime. I would generally have two types of downtime during the day:\n\n1. Short downtime – &lt;5 minutes of downtime: finishing worksheet in class early, rest time between sets at the gym, toilet, etc.\n2. Long downtime – 10+ minutes of downtime: Leaving class early/class being canceled, meals, showers, commutes, slow days at work, waits (such as for trains, buses, long lines), etc.\n\nMy short downtime happened several times per day and usually exceeded 30 minutes, more than enough time for me to finish my daily anki reps. In fact, funnily enough, I was so used to doing Anki during downtime that the only days that I would miss reviews would be vacation days, since I would be free the whole day and it would never occur to me to finish my reps.\n\nMy long downtime was mostly used for reading, since it was annoying having to break focus/lose spot on your page during short downtime. Since my commute back and forth from class usually already added up to around \\~40 minutes a day, combining the two downtimes guaranteed that I would squeeze in an hour a day at least of study. Any active study I did outside of that (usually 1-2 hours a day) would be pure reading.\n\nOne more note was that I would always keep earbuds in listening to Japanese content whenever possible. I generally cycle between four times of content: 1) anime episodes converted to mp3 files, 2) Japanese conversation videos on youtube converted to mp3, 3) podcasts, 4) music, in decreasing order of effectiveness. I would keep this on in the background when I was doing something that didn’t require a lot of thinking, like working out, walking, eating, etc. Unfortunately, only one of my part time jobs is a desk job and the others are customer-facing, but if you have a desk job/something that doesn’t require you to talk to people you can definitely do this while you work as well.\n\nCheap/free reading material:\n\nAs an extremely broke person I was always scouring for cheap/free reading material. There are a couple of good ones that I used:\n\n1. [https://syosetu.com/](https://syosetu.com/) – this is a site that aspiring LN authors post on, it’s useful because many famous anime/LNs are published here first and you can read the whole thing for free. I was surprised by how many there are, for example, you can read Mushoku Tensei, that time I reincarnated as a slime, finest assassin, re:Zero, etc. all for free.\n2. Free/Discounted VNs – Steam has a lot of free or discounted VNs that can provide hundreds of hours of free reading. If you check [https://steam250.com/tag/visual\\_novel](https://steam250.com/tag/visual_novel) a lot of VNs are free or dirt cheap (&lt;$10), just make sure it’s available in Japanese.\n3. Libraries – this doesn’t apply to everyone, but sometimes your local library (uni or public) carries some JP books/manga.\n4. Hoist the sails ye scallywag! If you know you know.\n\nUnfortunately though, at the end of the day if you are broke then you can’t be too picky with your reading material. Unless you use #4.\n\nAnyways, don’t want to drag on this post for too long, if you have any questions drop em below and I’ll probably stick around for 24 hours or so. Good luck and happy learning!\n\nMiscellaneous Anki Stats:\n\nTotal Cards: \\~9000, 8000 of which are mature\n\nTotal Reviews over last year: \\~30,000",

        "text": "I'm in a Japanese language class and we were doing diolouge practice. Me and another student were volunteered to practice the diolouge in front of the class. I tried to make sure that my speech while reading the script the teacher gave us was as proper and natural sounding as I could get. After class however one of the students told me that my speech sounded too \"anime\" and that it was very rude. This horrified me because I definitely wasn't trying to sound like that and I absolutely know that anime speech is far from proper and shouldn't be used. I do have a deep voice and he seemed to take special issue with how I pronounced どうも in the conversation. We were reading from a script so I wasn't using any weird language, his main problem seemed to be how deep I said どうも (I think). The only other problem I can think of that he might of meant was the slight Japanese accent I use while speaking Japanese. This whole interaction has left me very worried as I'm going to Japan in May and my worst fear would be offending anyone with how I talk. My teacher didn't say anything and she's a native speaker however the guy who corrected me has a Japanese wife so I assume he knows what he's talking about so I'm very unsure if I actually did anything wrong or not and if I did I want to correct it as soon as possible. Should I try and talk higher than my natural voice? Should I not use an accent? My understanding was that most of being polite was the words you use, I didn't know having a deep voice and an accent sounded too \"anime\". I really don't want to sound rude, so any advice is greatly appreciated.",

Did the original version include the cliff radical but get abbreviated to just a small corner line as short-hand?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10k9p11/passing_the_jlpt_n2_exam_after_225_years_179180/",
        "text": "Today I found out that I passed the December JLPT N2 exam with a score of 179/180!!\n\nI was fresh out of Genki II at the beginning of May last year and I've put in a lot of time towards improving my Japanese since then, so it feels great to see a concrete result like this.\n\nSince the study methods that I've followed so far have generally been successful for me, I wanted to share my Japanese language learning experience over the first two years and three months (September 2020 to December 2022), focusing on May 2022 onwards when I began to fully prioritize studying Japanese and started to progress much faster than I had before.\n\n**Score breakdown**\n\n* Language knowledge: 60/60\n* Reading: 60/60\n* Listening: 59/60\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/pCivzFJ](https://imgur.com/a/pCivzFJ)\n\n**Estimates of my time spent learning Japanese by exam day**\n\n* **Active study**: 1600+ hours (classes, textbooks, Anki)\n* **Reading outside of class**: 50+ hours (manga, novels, news, etc.)\n* **Japanese-subtitled anime**: 250+ hours\n* **Japanese music**: 2000+ hours ([all i know is that it's a very large number](https://www.last.fm/user/bentosekai))\n* **Podcasts**: 70+ hours\n\n**Some rough stats from May to December 2022**\n\nFrom early May to the day of the N2 exam (December 4, 2022), I did about [26,000 reviews in Anki](https://imgur.com/a/WpTiopT).  I tend to average around 30 seconds per card, so I spent more than 200 hours on reviews, but my actual time spent in Anki was a lot longer because of making/editing cards.\n\nFactoring in the time I spent writing out kanji, doing the Kanji in Context workbook exercises, studying the Shin Kanzen Master N3 and N2 grammar books, and working on my university classes, I probably spent more than 1000 hours actively studying Japanese during this period.\n\nIn terms of immersion, I watched just over 80 hours of Japanese-subtitled anime and 10 hours of a Japanese-subtitled drama, read for fun for maybe 10 hours, and listened to around 50 hours of podcasts (actively) and 500+ hours of Japanese music (mainly passively). I also switched the language on my phone to Japanese slightly earlier in the spring, but I had to keep switching it back to English fairly often until late last summer.\n\nI've been on exchange in Japan since early September, but I spent a lot of my time leading up to the N2 exam studying in my dorm, so I had been exposed to \\~100 hours of conversational Japanese and spent 20-30 hours reading documents/forms/news/labels/train ads and the like by exam day.\n\n**Looking back on the N2 exam**\n\nHeading into the exam, I was nervous as usual but knew that I had prepared enough not to worry about passing as long as I could make it through the whole thing.\n\nUnfortunately, my seat just so happened to be across from someone who was coughing intermittently throughout the entire exam, so there were a few moments where my focus slipped and I had to force my attention back to my test paper. At first I was pretty frustrated about this, but I got used to it eventually.\n\nSince I had been reviewing grammar in the lead-up to the test, I started with the grammar section before moving onto vocab and then reading. The grammar section was fairly straightforward, but I was annoyed that I switched to the wrong answer on one question purely because my initial (correct) answer was a grammar point that I knew wasn't on any JLPT list to date.\n\nI also made a mistake on one of the affixes in the vocab section, but I really enjoyed the vocab because I ran into a bunch of words that I had encountered in the wild. For example, the last word in the vocab section was the title of a song released by one of my favourite bands 羊文学 last year, and I had made an anki card for another word that popped up on the exam while watching Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge last summer.\n\nI expected reading comprehension to be my weakest point, but it actually ended up being the section that I felt most confident on. I was able to absorb the text way faster than I would have been able to even a few months earlier, and I could tell that actively studying grammar and reading short academic texts for one of my Japanese classes at uni had made a big difference in terms of my reading comprehension.\n\nBy the time the listening section came around, I was feeling the fatigue from the earlier sections so it was a bit harder to stay focused. I'm pretty sure that I got the second part of the last listening question wrong, and another one I wasn't sure I heard properly. I was at the back of the exam room so it was slightly harder to hear the audio coming from the speakers at the front, but the aforementioned coughing person sitting across from me came in clutch and did their best to hold it in while the dialogue was playing, which I really appreciated.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't exactly expecting to get this close to 180 even with the JLPT's scaled scoring system, but I'm genuinely proud of my score. My main goal was to understand the content of the exam while having developed the practical skills to back up the result, and I think I accomplished that. \n\n**Timeline of my progress in Japanese**\n\nI started studying Japanese in the fall of 2020 after transferring out of engineering into humanities at university, where I'm now majoring in East Asian studies and linguistics.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I didn't start from absolutely nothing. I had watched 900+ hours of English-subtitled anime since mid-2018 and listened to Japanese music fairly consistently from around the same time, so I was able to recognize the sounds of Japanese and some common phrases. However, I had no prior knowledge of kanji and didn't learn to read or write kana before I started taking classes in September of 2020, so I was very much a beginner at this point.\n\n**September 2020 to August 2021: First-year Japanese**\n\nWe used Genki I in my first-year Japanese class, which was slow paced but had tons of assignments, quizzes, and tests. By the end of the course, I could read and write kana and about [200 kanji](https://imgur.com/a/tOcg4dj). I probably put 200-250 hours into studying Japanese for this course from September to April.\n\nImmersion-wise, I went through a massive media burnout from the fall of 2020 onwards, so I kept listening to Japanese music but mostly stopped watching anime for about a year.\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, I was taking linguistics courses the entire time so in terms of studying Japanese I just tried to get through part of the Core 2k/6k Anki deck. I put in 70-80 hours across [9000+ reviews](https://imgur.com/a/V24iEQr) and made it to around 1600 words before dropping the deck permanently in September (eventually I fully deleted it).  At the time, I found it unreasonably difficult to try to remember words with kanji that I hadn't studied yet while still at the beginner level, so I decided to concentrate my energy on second-year Japanese heading into the fall.\n\n**September 2021 to April 2022: Second-year Japanese**\n\nMuch like the previous year, we used Genki II in my second-year Japanese class at a similar pace. Somehow the workload got heavier, which made balancing Japanese with my other classes a challenge. Heading into 2022, I also got a bad running injury which turned out to be the first of a series of unfortunate events that made it very hard to focus on uni and affected my Japanese progress for a couple months, but these things happen.\n\nBy the time I finished Genki II in April of 2022, I was around the lower intermediate level overall with slightly worse speaking skills, having learned to read and write about [400 kanji](https://imgur.com/a/RkTa7qf). I probably spent around 250 hours actively studying Japanese during this period. I also started reading my first manga in Japanese, which was of course Yotsuba, although I've still only read a few volumes.\n\n**May to August 2022: Kanji in Context** (400 → 1540 kanji)\n\nIn May, I decided not to take any summer courses and focus on recovering from my running injury and the challenges of the previous semester, so I ended up dedicating most of my time to studying kanji using the Kanji in Context textbook and workbooks. I wanted to learn as many kanji as possible before leaving for Japan in the fall because I was concerned about not being able to navigate life here on my own without being literate in Japanese.\n\nI used the stroke order charts on [jisho.org](https://jisho.org) for reference while writing out a word containing each kanji in the relevant lesson of the KIC textbook at least once to help absorb the form of the kanji better before reviewing all of the vocab in Anki ([here's some of my handwriting practice](https://imgur.com/gallery/UHUrl3L)). I generally didn't bother writing out the 400 or so kanji that I had already studied.\n\nAt first, I was studying around 20 new kanji per day including doing the KIC workbook exercises, manually adding example sentences from the workbook to the cards in the [premade KIC vocab deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1996057559) that I was using, and going through 160+ reviews in Anki, so I was feeling burnt out after about a month and a half.\n\nHaving made it to 1000 kanji by the end of June, I started manually replacing the English definitions on the cards in the KIC deck with Japanese ones using a monolingual dictionary imported to yomichan (大辞林) so that I could internalize the way things are described in Japanese and learn more synonyms/antonyms. To stop myself from burning out fully, I also changed up my schedule a bit. One day, I would spend 4-6 hours doing my Anki reviews, setting up the vocab cards for around 20 kanji, repositioning some cards so that I could study more related vocab at once, and looking for extra example sentences online (using chiebukuro, hinative, and eventually [yourei.jp](https://yourei.jp/)). The next day, I would spend a similar amount of time finishing my daily reviews, writing out around 20 new kanji, doing the KIC workbook exercises, and then studying the new vocab in Anki.\n\nI also started taking days off, enjoying time by the lake in Toronto, cycling around the city more as my leg gradually recovered, and preparing for my upcoming exchange in Japan, which meant that I ended up averaging around 10 kanji per day from May to August.\n\nTowards the end of the summer, I finally started reading my first novel in Japanese. I chose 5 Centimeters per Second, because I had already seen the film a few times and I could picture the scenery even if the first page felt like it took a million years to read. Unfortunately, I got caught up with life, put it down after about 40 pages, and haven't done much reading for fun since, although I do intend to get back to it soon.\n\nBy the end of this process, my kanji recognition, [vocabulary](https://imgur.com/a/OodG9Tg), and intuitive understanding of Japanese grammar had improved to the point that I could do reasonably well on the JLPT website's N2 sample questions ([available here](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/samples/forlearners.html)) and partially guess my way through the vocab, grammar, and reading sections of a past N1 exam, albeit in more than 1.5x the time permitted on the actual test. \n\nOn the other hand, I realized that my speaking and writing weren't keeping up with my reading and listening because I hadn't taken the time to output consistently over the summer. I had still only spoken with a Japanese native speaker twice in total outside of my classes at uni, and most of my grammar knowledge beyond the early intermediate level came from looking up grammar structures that I found in the KIC workbook.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided to try to get a solid grasp of N2 grammar in the fall while working on my vocab and speaking skills. My ultimate goal for the year was to pass the N2 exam and feel like I earned it.\n\n**September 2022: Moving to Japan**\n\nI moved to Japan for my exchange at 東大, so I didn't have the time or energy to study as much while getting settled in Tokyo. I kept up with my daily reviews in Anki and studied 20 more kanji with KIC to get up to a total of 1560, which is where I stopped until after the N2 exam.\n\n**October to early December 2022: Shin Kanzen Master N2 grammar**\n\nMy classes started in early October, with half of them being Japanese language courses (conversation, academic skills, and tutorial). In the tutorial class, the whole point was to make our own study plan and follow through with it, so I decided to study the Shin Kanzen Master N2 grammar book from front to back by exam day.\n\nStarting in mid-October, I typed most of the content of the book straight into my [notes](https://imgur.com/a/xLzC6s9), made an [anki deck containing each grammar point](https://imgur.com/a/15ZVOvW), worked through the practice problems (excluding the ones for individual lessons in the first section), and added extra example sentences to my grammar cards from the practice problems while checking my answers.\n\nI worked on both part 1 (individual grammar points) and part 3 (sentence/paragraph-level grammar) of the book every week and finished part 2 (sentence construction) a few days before the N2 exam in early December. Breaking things down at the individual grammar point/word level in the first part of the textbook while also working my way through sentence and paragraph structure in part 3 really helped me improve my overall understanding of Japanese sentence structure, and I liked that all of the explanations were exclusively written in Japanese because I find English translations very distracting.\n\nThe night before the N2 exam, I had a major deadline for one of my other classes so I stayed up slightly late afterwards to do the two mock N2 grammar exams at the back of the SKM book, got a half-decent night's sleep, and then skimmed the grammar points the next morning/on my way to the test centre.\n\n**Reflecting on the process**\n\nIt was tough balancing serious self-study with my other uni courses while simultaneously adjusting to life in Japan, but putting in the time to study N2 grammar properly made a huge difference in terms of my overall confidence with my Japanese ability. I feel like I can put together sentences much more naturally now without having to actively focus on 'building' them as much as I used to.\n\nCoupled with my kanji study using Kanji in Context, studying grammar with Shin Kanzen Master got me to the point where I was able to make it through the N2 exam with enough time to review my answers, which was a big deal for me because I often struggle with time on tests and never thought that I would be able to read or process information even remotely quickly in Japanese.\n\nIn terms of immersion last year before I came to Japan, finally getting back into anime (with Japanese subtitles) to help me destress while doing some extra vocab mining, working my way from JLPT level-specific podcasts to the 朝日新聞 podcast by the end of the summer, and basically listening to Japanese music all the time made a big difference in terms of improving my vocabulary and listening skills.\n\nTaking half of my classes at uni in Japanese while living in the heart of Tokyo obviously helped me improve my Japanese even faster during the last three months before the exam, and gradually building confidence in my spoken Japanese by talking to native speakers on a regular basis was something that I only really could have accomplished here, but I wouldn't have been able to make it to the starting line without building a solid kanji and vocab base through consistent self-study last summer.\n\n**Moving forward**\n\nMy first semester in Japan is coming to an end this week, so I'm hoping to explore Tokyo and the rest of the country more in the next couple months, see some of my favourite artists perform live, and really try to take everything in while I'm here.\n\nIn terms of studying Japanese, my current plan is to finish learning the jouyou kanji with Kanji in Context (I'm at 1660 now) and work my way through the Shin Kanzen Master N1 grammar book in preparation for the N1 exam in July so that I can get it done before my exchange ends in August.\n\nThere were a lot of moments of frustration and doubt along the way, but ultimately I was able to stay motivated to study for the same reason I started learning Japanese in the first place: I love the way it sounds (the writing system is cool too).\n\nI just hope that I never forget what it feels like to enjoy learning something new:)",

        "text": "Hey!Ｉ just passed the JLPT N1 in 5 years. I know that that is very normal, especially given that my score was kind of poop (118/180, 40/40/38). I am not here to say that I am one of the greats. But I do see a lot of people here who respond to these people (Doth, Jazzy, Matt, Khatzumoto, etc) by asking if their methods are worth it when you can't do it for 8 hours a day, people who say \"anything works if you do it 8 hours a day\", etc. I thought it would be good to share my perspective on the results I got and the struggles of a less-than-perfect immersion learner who is only doing Some Japanese Some of the Time.\n\nMy start: My Japanese class online at school was awful. We were told to go to the computer lab and then watch/respond to pre-recorded lessons, which I eventually could not do because some guy hacked my account and started sexually harrassing other students. I learned of this when I got an email apologizing me for all of the negative things the teachers were saying to me every video after catching said man-- I never actually watched the videos because I was busy looking at world of warcraft stuff and skipping. I eventually stopped taking the class and decided I would try again in college. At the time, I was bullied for speaking weirdly. Sometimes, I would never talk at all, ignoring people who were talking to me. Other times, I would simply stop talking in the middle of a question. Other times, I would respond to what people told me by going on very long tangents that were often completely unrelated. My parents thought it was ADHD, but as I grew older, we learned it was something a little... different. \n\nBy the time I did try again in college, I began developing the telltale signs of a mental disorder called schizophrenia. For those of you who don't know what schizophrenia is (there are many misconceptions), schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness with several major symptoms such as disorganized thought, catatonia, and psychosis.  I had had my first full psychotic break around the time I was 17 after a failed suicide attempt (I didn't know melatonin wasn't the kind of sleeping pill that kills you), and by my first year of college the hallucinations had gotten more frequent.  I was seeing tall, oblong grey men walk by out the windows, hands reaching into my house to grab things, UFOs that breathe people in through their mouths (not trying to spoil any movies here, but if you know the movie I'm talking about I was very surprised to see someone else had thought of that). Sometimes I would come home to find my mattress was a piece of meat. Some of my hallucinations are more mundane. To this day, I will see people down the street only for them to fade away in front of my eyes. Sometimes I will be sightseeing with a friend and point out something that they don't see. These hallucinations are less frequent now than they used to be (apparently those kinds of symptoms get less severe with age), but at the time they were deeply distressing. I would lose sleep, fall asleep suddenly, have stress convulsions... the lack of sleep then caused me to have increased rates of sleep paralysis, which caused me to, of course, hallucinate more.\n\nThis, combined with my increasingly disorganized speech patterns and catatonia, made Japanese class a nightmare for me. Most of the other people in the class made fun of me (it was a weird mix of ex/current navy people who were posted in Japan and, of course, weeaboos. I'm obviously not in the army). My teachers simultaneously thought I was faking it and thought I was crazy. I would skip several days of class just because I was catatonic (if you don't know what catatonia is, it has a lot of different forms but for me was basically just sitting still doing nothing for several hours-- think Shinji Ikari in the beginning of the Evangelion finale), and eventually decided I would drop out again. I transferred colleges to go somewhere in a town where my family's medical insurance was accepted, so I had to go somewhere without a Japanese class anyway. \n\nI still wanted to learn Japanese, though. The language sounded beautiful to me, and everything I had ever known was Japanese.  My first word as a baby was \"dinosaur\" and like any rational person would, my mother bought me Godzilla movies to watch as a kid. I grew up in the 1990s, so the next big things in my life were obviously Mario and Pokemon. My parents both had Hondas. By the time anime entered my life, I would almost say I liked it because it was Japanese. I learned that English teaching was a way to enter Japan, and so I changed my focus from Japanese learning to English teaching, and joined a linguistics program, where I worked my way into a few of the graduate-level TEFL teaching theory courses.\n\nIt is here that I had first learned of modern paradigms in language-learning, starting with the work of American linguist Stephen Krashen.  Explanations are not always necessary, doing textbook drills is largely a waste of time. With the right input, a student can figure out what something means by themselves, and our job as teachers was to give a variety of example sentences in the most natural way we could, so that students could develop their figuring-it-out muscles and eventually move on to reading and listening and figuring things out themselves. It was important for students to figure things out themselves-- Krashen's i+1 model meant that a structured, rigid curriculum was only going to hold students back. Even if we all forget things, I am going to forget different things than you are, and the deeper we get into language learning, the less a classroom helps at all. I needed the ability to determine for myself what sentences I could or couldn't read, and I needed to develop the skills to process input myself. Input and autonomy. \n\nI then worked dead-end jobs for a few years and forgot what I had learned in college before being accepted to work at my first eikaiwa English teaching job in November 2016. When I moved to Japan, I had forgotten about 1/3rd of the kana and only recognized the kanji for 1-10. I had weird-ass beliefs about grammar-- I thought ga was like, a second auxilliary wa. I'm sure they explained it in class but as I said above I was born to trip balls involuntarily so I didn't remember any of it.  I arrived in Japan in December with the thought of \"ok, now that I live here I'll just pick it up\". \n\nI learned, to my horror, that most people here do not, in fact, \"just pick it up\". I joined a weekly Japanese class that was provided by the company and learned very quickly that, not only did none of the staff (neither my foreign coworkers nor the Japanese teacher) have ANY background in language teaching, many of them were still learning N4-level grammar once a week after living in Japan for over a decade!  They would often get frustrated as their Japanese friends railroaded conversations back into English, or their Japanese partner would refuse to teach them Japanese. There was a belief in the gaijin bubble that that was the secret-- if you had a Japanese boyfriend or girlfriend, that was the ticket to N1 town. So I went fuck it and downloaded Tinder. \n\nThis is when I had my first breakthrough. Tinder profiles were hard to read, but you obviously have to read a woman's profile if you want a chance because, well, that should be obvious. Suddenly, the TEFL training I had received began to flow back into me. What if I just... looked up the words and figured it out myself? I began to look everything up. Street signs, tinder profiles, advertisements, more tinder profiles (look as I said above, I'm a psycho, it's not like women are waiting in line to date me OK), tinder messages... all had words, but sentences were still out of reach. I went and picked up a few volumes of OnePunchMan, which I had watched and loved in English, and began reading. I think this is a great way to start studying-- take something you have already seen in English and begin going through the Japanese,  This wasn't exactly that-- I saw the anime in English and then read the manga in Japanese, but this was close enough. I also used i+1 to determine my lookups. For kanji, I had something I call the 3-kanji rule:\n\n\\-If there is a word with 3 kanji in it\n\n\\-And I know two of those kanji\n\n\\-Then that third kanji is the next one I will learn and my anchor word will be that word. \n\n I suddenly found I was improving significantly faster than anyone else in the company Japanese class, and stopped going altogether.  I began to feel like I had found some kind of magical, secret spell-- wait, you can just go up to words you don't know and look them up?! Sometimes you can figure out what they mean and sound like before you even whip out the smartphone? Guys, students, teachers, I just found something that's going to revolutionize the-- it turns out our school was deliberately providing a service with the knowledge that students were not going to do that. My boss pulled me aside and said \"we are giving something like weekend piano lessons, not training Beethoven\". Oh. Well, I tried to tell all my coworkers and friends at the bar that this could really help them with the Japanese struggles they were hav-- \"what are those words you're learning you're never gonna use those\". Oh. \n\nI eventually moved to Tokyo, where I had a job for a \"black company\" that had me work for sometimes over 75 hours a week with over 20 whole hours of unpaid overtime work. My immersion time was limited, and the usefulness of Tinder was wearing out. Every profile said the same stuff, and it's not like I had time to date anyone, and it's not like anyone would want to date a guy who was both always working and broke as fuck. I needed a new strategy. I had heard people talking about a method called AJATT, and an app called anki. This took my strategy to the next level. I could read manga on the bus and train, take pictures of the panels with stuff I didn't know, and then sneak a few anki flashcards in during my break time, and then drill those cards when I got home. This was called sentence mining, and I did it by hand, and most of my early anki cards were shit. I could (this is still true) only stomach reading on the bus and train, though, as the antipsychotic medication I used to take has left me with a semi-crippling nerve disease called akathisia, where sitting still or doing a calm, single task for more than 10-70 seconds at a time makes me want to scream. Even writing this post, I get up to walk around about twice per paragraph.  But I didn't let that stop me. Even if I had no time, or couldn't stomach doing anything, I was going to do WHAT I could. Where a lot of people would \"take a break\" or just burn out and quit, I decided hey, fuck it, 15 minutes a day isn't going to make me fluent but 0 minutes a day won't either. It's better to do a little here and there than it is to do nothing. \n\nWhen I left that job, I suddenly found, to my surprise, that all of the \"weird\" \"useless\" words I had learned looking stuff up allowed me to read newspaper articles and even watch anime with JP subs pretty comfortably. Anime was harder than manga, but that was because it was in real time and I didn't know a good mining set-up. By the time covid hit, I was watching Hunter X Hunter all day and I got what I thought was a good amount of it (80%\\~, absolute garbage compared to now) and then one of those days spiders were everywhere and I don't really remember that part of my life too well. It was what we in the language learning business call \"a malaise\". In 2020 I stumbled my way through the N2 test in 2020, which is 3... or four years? I moved to Japan at the end of 2016 so like, is it . The night before taking N2, I had finally met a lady on Tinder, but there was a twist. She was a foreigner who matched with me because my Japanese impressed her. She was N1. She had passed in 2 years-- man what was she doing being impressed by some guy like me? But more importantly, she liked kaiju. She once got beaten up by her big sister because she woke her up at 5AM to watch Ultraman. \n\nThat's when a man named Doth rocked my fucking world. \n\nHe passed the N1 test in less than 2 years and was able to enjoy Japanese content at a level I literally couldn't even imagine. He was reading whole Japanese novels and VNs at a pace I couldn't even read that stuff in English! I joined TMW and began to prepare for the N1 test. Other people talked about tracking and whitenoising, but I thought, pfft. Whatever. I can just do what I always did, go with the flow. I spend sun-up to sundown doing anime sometimes. That's 8 hours and 8 episodes, what can be more AJATT than that, right?\n\nI failed the December 2021 JLPT, and immediately after I made my sob post about failing, a man in the very same discord channel was shocked and surprised to learn that, not only had he passed, but he had achieved a 180/180! His name was Jazzy. I thought, eh, I got 91/180, he had only been studying for 8 months. He was certainly impressive, but I didn't need a perfect score and with my \"years\" of inputting I could totally pass the next test no problem. I couldn't read super-well.\n\nSpoiler alert: I failed again. That's when I went back and looked at what they did. It was really easy to look at, because they logged their input hours: what kind of thing they were doing, how much they were doing. This was the final piece of the puzzle for me. I could SPEND  8 hours \"focusing\" on immersion, but the log made me see myself as I really am. I was doing maybe an hour, or an hour and a half per day, tops. I fucked the listening section up the most, so I would focus on that. Between August and December last year, I watched at least 2 hours of content a day (sometimes 3), half of that was anime, the other half was... random other stuff. I did about 12,400 minutes of raw listening, between when I started tracking and when I learned I passed this Sunday night, and most of that was in September, October, November, late August, and early December. \n\n At first, it was news, because everyone says the news is important for understanding the N1, but as someone who has both taken the test multiple times and (technically) passed it, I don't really think that's true. It has a lot of N1 grammar, but so did the Pokemon Adventures manga I was reading on the train. The important thing here wasn't what I watched or listened to, but that I kept the pump flowing. Whenever I had time to, I would sneak in a 10-minute Youtube video, or get out an extra episode of anime. I never sat down and then, 3 hours later, finished my study. I found I had a lot more time in my day than I thought. I had done some passive listening when I felt an (increasingly rare, thankfully) episode of catatonia coming on, but I never logged that.  When one thing started to get boring, I would put it down and get something else. I started the year having read nothing. When I failed the July test, I had 4 books half read and one book finished. By December, I had fully read 2 books. Now I am on book number 5. Tracking myself forced me to push myself to a level where I was actually improving. I went from understanding most of an anime to hearing every word of dialog in an unsubbed episode clear as day. I got a 38/48/48 on my one practice test, a copy of the 2010 December JLPT N1 (I forgot how my gf calculated that in from the raw score but I will edit that in here when I ask her tonight), and walked into the test room confident. \n\nI left a nervous wreck. I thought I was gonna fail again. I got an A/A in the raw scores of the vocab section in July, so I thought I didn't need help there. Turns out they decided to put all the words I still didn't know on this test. The listening was also, as always, a test of my fucking stamina as much as it was a test of my listening ability. Remember, I can barely sit down for a minute without wanting to scream. At least that's the excuse I am going to make here. One of my friends tried to get me some ritalin for the test but my girlfriend stopped us. Probably for the best. \n\nWell, I didn't really get a good score, but it did work in helping me pass! I got a 40/40/38 (I will edit the proof in when I get home tonight), seeing improvements of over 10 points in all 3 areas. Not as good as the practice test I did, but good enough to say I have N1. I know from the leaked results (and from the fact I know the words) that I got a perfect score in the kanji portion, which probably helped me get a 40 despite the fact that, as I said, the vocab section had a bunch of vocab I didn't know. I was shocked to see I also got A/A on the raw scores this time as well. I've never done RTK or WaniKani or anything. I go out and talk to Japanese friends on the regular and work in positions where I am the only English speaker, I make do in Japanese. My spoken Japanese could be better, but I can talk pretty comfortably on most topics and my rate of mistakes is going down as I notice the things I said wrong and quietly make a mental note not to say that again. People have told me my Japanese ability skyrocketed after covid. I think there's something about not talking for a while that helped me.   \n\n\nI don't have any specific advice to anyone other than, I dunno, just go read and listen to stuff and look things up. You don't need to spend years doing ineffective stuff to \"build a foundation\"'; my foundation was shit but I still made something out of it.

        "text": "can someone tell me if I have the basic idea of kanji understood?\nSo kana is just a literal syllabary. And that it’s purpose is to well, give kanji a way to be spoken.\nKana-&gt; a kanji (水) is given a general meaning-&gt; a new word can be formed by combining two or more kanji together to give it new reading but one that is still derived from its individual kanjis. \n\nkanji have different reading (words) because multiple words are written with same kanji which is why kana has or can be apart of kanji, because it is a whole different word, just using the same kanji and modifying it with kana (so to speak).\nTo sum up, kanji a visual language.\n(like emojis)? \nThat can be modified into news words by having kana be apart of the word( 食べる) or being part of a another kanji to make a new word(時間) and kana just gives us to give it multiple meanings or readings/ a way to voice the kanji because they are essentially small pictures or drawing.\n But then I’m confused by the use of kana as whole words all together in sentences in general. Why don’t they get written with a kanji? Since no spaces and can be confused for particles? \nI guess that it’s like English in that regard, you just have to know beforehand or have someone tell you.\nSo I this a good rough of how it works?\nIt’s a visual language kanji with kanji being actually vocabulary.\n (and then someone thought it was a neat idea to categorize all the radicals into a basic system to try and make things easier to learn.)",

Use this knowledge to treat any text like a guided reader without having to do the work manually.\n\nIf you don't want highly frequent words because you know them already, you can restrict to, say, words less frequent than the top 1000, or words with a frequency value of &gt; XYZ (if you know a lot about linguistic corpora and that's something you're into, go for the frequency value, if not, rank threshold is pretty easy to understand).\n\nCaveats: \n\n* You'll need a certain base level of computer savvy to install and run it, but everything necessary is linked, free, and I tried to keep the installation explanations at an intermediate level. \n* The frequency corpus data from BCCWJ is a large file, but since it required a pretty advanced level of Japanese to even figure out where the CSV file lived, I included it in the repo. It's free for non-commercial use. \n* I didn't include kana in the output because parsing it from the JMDict file and matching it with the corresponding kanji was not straightforward for words with multiple readings. If this really gets under your skin, I encourage forking :)\n\nIf you happen to dabble in local EPWING files, there's some code to use JSONified versions of them as an alternate to the (free and lovely, but less comprehensive) JMDict. I used [https://github.com/FooSoft/zero-epwing](https://github.com/FooSoft/zero-epwing) to convert to JSON.\n\nI hope this is helpful to someone!",

My weakest section was reading and grammar with 35, (Kanji and Vocabulary 40, Listening 51) I reckon this is probably where I should focus more time and effort.\n\nTo pass N3, I mostly read news from the NHK easy news, plus some relatively easy mangas (mostly slice of life or comedy stuff), and some texts from mock tests and previous exams. \n\nBased on previous posts addressing similar questions, I started reading native material, while also studying grammar and vocabulary from other sources. To get me started, I bought a couple of digital light novels (Konosuba for those interested) and video games in Japanese. I’m having fun but unsurprisingly, my reading speed and progress is very slow, lots of kanjis and words I’m not familiar with, plus some grammar I haven’t studied yet. On top of that, reading from my iPad is a bit painful, can only handle a couple of hours before my head and eyes start hurting a bit. \n\nShould I get the printed versions of those books? At the expense of having the convenience of easily looking for the vocab and kanjis I don’t know (I’m using book walker for reading those novels). Perhaps I should start with easier novels instead? If that’s the case, which ones would you recommend? I’m not picky in terms of genres, as long as the story is fun and relatively easy to follow). \n\nLastly, is kindle a better alternative for reading digital books? I’ve never owned one, I’m not too fond of buying more gadgets, but if it gonna help me getting the job done, I’m willing to consider it.\n\nMany thanks in advance!",

The problem started at 1200-ish kanji, I noticed I began to rush through some cards, it didn't always happened but when it did I often took some time to fix it and go on. This is happening because it's getting quite boring for me, and I'm considering in abandoning it and just focus on learning the rest through immersion like I'm doing right now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, RTK is cool af and greatly helped me and was certainly worth my time, however It seems to me it's enough the baggage I got from it. I thinking in just sticking with sentence mining, manga, anime and news reading.\n\nI just made this post just to get some different viewpoints. So, what would y'all do in this situation?  Keep with RTK until at least reaching 2600+ or moving on with only 1680+ kanji and sticking with learning the rest through encountering it from immersion?",

        "text": "TLDR; I started learning Japanese because of a stupid misunderstanding. In 750 days, that misunderstanding spiraled into an amazing opportunity to pass the JLPT N1, meet amazing people, and maybe learn a bit of Japanese on the side.\n\nMy results: [https://imgur.com/a/kqOk3X0](https://imgur.com/a/kqOk3X0). \n\nSorry if the writing is bad; I'm writing this only an hour after the JLPT results came out. Because of the impromptu nature of this post, I may come back and add more details as I remember them. \n\n My purpose in this post is to tell my story of how I learned Japanese. When I started \"learning\" Japanese, I thought reaching a proficient level was near impossible for a non-native speaker. I hope this gives someone in a similar position inspiration that they too can become, if not native, at least 日本語上手.   \nI should preface this by saying that my Japanese journey isn't especially amazing or unique. There are people who have gotten higher N1 scores in less time. Nevertheless, I think my journey has been unique enough to (maybe) justify this sort of write-up. I intend not to focus on specific resources (for that, I recommend Doth's and Jazzy's posts) but on how my attitude towards Japanese learning has changed over time. \n\nFirst, a bit of background about me. I'm a first-year university student studying a field that has nothing to do with Japanese. I grew up in a Viet household but came out understanding only English and learning none of my second language (a lot of people joke about this, but I legitimately understand next to no Vietnamese). At school, I took French for 2 years, Latin for 4 years, and attempted to learn both of those languages and Vietnamese on Duolingo. Despite finishing all of the French Duolingo tree and most of the Vietnamese tree, I learned essentially nothing. (I got a B in French 1). Basically, before learning Japanese, I believed that I was uniquely bad at languages and that I could never learn any language other than English, let along something like Japanese. \n\nI started learning Japanese on accident. I'm a big otaku, so you probably won't be surprised that one of my big motivators in learning Japanese was to consume content that wasn't available in English. At the time, there was a visual novel that I violently wanted to read. For some inexplicable reason, after a bit of research on the Japanese syllabary, I believed that all you needed to do to become fluent enough to read Japanese was learn to read hiragana. Alas, to my unending chagrin, that was not the case. Once I learned Hiragana and (gasp!) realized I didn't magically understand Japanese, I convinced myself that if I learned katakana, I would be able to understand Japanese fully. Then, after learning katakana, I thought I only needed to learn the most common 100 kanji. \n\nEssentially, my decision to learn Japanese was a series of self-delusions. Because of this, I gave up on the idea of learning Japanese very quickly. At the time I was invested in other hobbies as well so I didn't really have a lot of time for another. \n\nSo I quit for six months. Another failed language. Another reason to believe I just didn't have the talent to learn another language. \n\nThis all changed when, one and a half years from today, I saw a reddit post titled \"My \\~500 day journey to a 160/180 N1 score.\" When I read that post by Doth, I became so inspired that I promised myself (mostly as a joke) that if I ever passed the N1, I would write a similar post in the hopes that someone would get something out of it. And now, well, here we are. \n\nIt was this reddit post that convinced me that I had the ability to learn Japanese, that it wasn't me that was wrong but my methods. It was because of this post that I decided to learn Japanese. \n\nMy methods are primarily immersion-based. I relearned hiragana and katakana and learned to recognize the 500 most common kanji. I spent an hour reading one chapter of manga. I struggled through the first chapter of Nekopara. I meticulously added every word I didn't know into my anki deck. I am ashamed to say that I pulled a Matt vs. Japan and bought three mp3 players so I could listen to Japanese every second of the day, even as I slept. I played more and more visual novels. For one and a half years, I became immersed in the Japanese language, and I loved it, despite my できない-ness. \n\nOne highlight I should mention during this time are two visual novels that kinda changed my life: 素晴らしき日々 and サクラの詩 (henceforth sakuuta). I'm a bit of a lit nerd as well, and I have to say, these are legitimately the two greatest works of media I have ever read. It was because of these two works that I started to understand the unique beauty of Japanese writing through exposure to different poems and works. Reading sakuuta in particular made me realize the rhythm and strangeness of Japanese prose and verse. Sorry if I sound like a nerd, but sakutoki is hype, what can I say?  \n\nDespite my increasing proficiency in Japanese, I had no speaking experience or any friends that I could share my hobby with. I found it embarrassing to admit that I was learning Japanese because people, at least in my experience, tend to look down on that because they just associate that with being a weeb. I personally find it infuriating that anyone should be looked down upon for learning something they care deeply about, but that's just me. For some reason, this only happens with Japanese and Korean. Before college, most people reacted with annoyance or slight ridicule when I told them I loved learning Japanese. \n\nThis started to change in college, where I began to find a community of other learners at my university's Japanese club. I really consider this a turning point. Before, I had just focused on consuming media and kept Japanese as a personal hobby. However, through meeting several people at my university, I realized that Japanese was also a great way to meet other people. (Shoutout to my national speech champion friend). Because of these friends, I realized that there was more to Japanese than just consuming media. Through them I had more chances to speak, learn about pitch accent, and increase my appreciation of Japanese in ways I hadn't considered before. I'm very thankful to be in a very weeby university and an even weebier club. \n\nThen, last month, I took the JLPT N1. I did next to no preparation and decided to sign up pretty much on a whim. I just wanted to test my Japanese skills and I came in pretty much expecting to fail. Aside from a single practice test (which I barely passed), I had no idea how I would do on the test. \n\nSo I booked a flight across the country, and prayed. \n\nAnd, I passed! What's more, I passed with an 128/180, something I could have never imagined two and a half years ago. It's hard to believe that I spent so much of my life wishing and wishing that I could learn Japanese, and it took me so long to finally take the plunge. I'm honestly astonished by the progress that I've been able to make (of course, through the help and resources of many, many people). \n\nOf course, there's still many areas of Japanese that I want to improve on. I'm hoping to study abroad in Japan for the summer for a month. I also want to improve my speaking skills and read at a native level. I'm also involved with my local Japanese club at my university where I hope to meet more Japanese learners and help others do what I thought was impossible only a few years ago. \n\nI also still have a lot of doubts about my Japanese.  Could I have done something more productive with this time? I don't know. Maybe I could have been a genius coder, a licensed architect, or even just learned several Indo-European languages in the same time frame. Has Japanese changed the way that I think? I don't know. My thinking certainly doesn't feel different than before. I still primarily think in English, though there are times I struggle to communicate a Japanese word or concept in English. Then, has learning Japanese \"changed my life\"? Again, I don't know. I don't know. \n\nBut did Japanese lead me to some of my favorite media of all time? Did it make me more curious about another culture? Did it allow me to meet some really cool people I never would have had the chance to meet otherwise? In essence, was learning Japanese worth it? \n\nHell yeah. Hell yeah it was. And I hope it'll be worth it for you as well.",

You can feel it.\n\t\n**Analysis of Results**\n\t\nThis is pretty much exactly the total score I thought I would get, but not the breakdown that I thought it would be. \n\t\nI thought I was going to get a perfect score on the reading section, and am surprised that it wasn't: I consider reading my best skill, and when I checked the leaked answers from the test (which came out like a week after the exam), I had a perfect score from what I remembered. \n\t\nI did not expect to get a perfect score on the listening and I distinctly remember zoning out during one question near the beginning and guessing, but overall this section was really easy and listening is the skill that I have put in the most time into so I guess it all worked out. \n\t\nVocab/Grammar section went exactly as expected based upon the practice test I took (which I share my score below). \n\t\n**Test Prep Materials?**\n\nIn true immersion method fashion, I didn't do much test-specific prep for the JLPT- I honestly just did a lot of immersion and a moderate amount of Anki and then took the test. \n\t\nHowever, I probably did more than some people in the community, and doing specific prep for the test is definetely a good idea if you are goinig to dish out the $$$ to travel and take the test.\n\nHere are some of the resources that I found useful:\n\t\n*Reading comprehension*: 新完全マスター 読解 N2\n\t\t\nBesides just reading a lot, this book was useful for getting used to the test format and the type of questions that are asked. \n\t\t\nWhile I also have the N1 version of this book, I never got around to going through it before the test; I found the N2 version had the same format and type of content (social/political/economic commentary, some science, philosphy, and business stuff) as the actual N1 test. I probably won't go through the N1 book because, honestly, the content is just quite boring. \n\t\t\nMy normal reading content is the following: literary works on Aozora Bunko from authors like 太宰治、夏目漱石、芥川龍之介、森鴎外、 various light novel series, books from Amazon (usually self-help, philosphy, or manga), wikipedia, history articles, and the occasional news article. \n\t\t\nI think that incorporating a wide range of reading material is key if you want to have the most success with your language learning pursuits- especially make sure to include a variety of fiction and non-fiction so that you get exposed to different styles of writing. \n\t\t\n*Grammar*: https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/\n\t\t\nI've always found the sentence mining approach to work really well for learning new grammar, and using a dedicated grammar guide, while boring, is usually the quickest way to do this. \n\t\t\nI went through this website in its entirety (N5-N1+) back in May~July and made sentence cards in Anki for new words/grammar patterns that I didn't know.\n\t\t\nAnother resource that I used was the Dictionary of (Intermediate) Japanese Grammar. \n\t\t\nI already knew most of the grammar points in the above resources just from reading and sentence mining native material, but it was a great review and I definetely did learn some new grammar points that I then later saw in books, wikipedia, etc. \n\n*Practice Test*\n\t\t\nI took the official N1 test from July 2010 about a week before the exam, November 26, just to see how the actual exam would be. \n\t\t\nOverall Score: 92/108 (85%, ~155/180)\n\t\t\n文字・語彙： 18/25\n\t\n文法： 16/20\n\t\t\n読解： 24/26 \n\t\t\n聴解： 34/37\n\t\t\nI finished the vocab and grammar section in 19 minutes, and the reading comprehension section in 49 minutes (There is a total of 110 minutes alloted for this section on the actual test).\n\t\t\nI think that doing this \"mock exam\" gave me good insight to my timing and my scores, and gave me a good strategy for the exam: do everything and then go back to the vocab/grammar section with leftover time to catch mistakes and get more points. \n\t\t\nThere are a lot more \"practice tests\" from 2010-2019 for those interested if you join The Moe Way Discord Server. \n\t\t\n*Discord Quizzes* that I occasionally did in my spare time. This was mainly helpful for the grammar and listening questions. \n\t\t\nN1 Vocab: k!quiz n1 nd 20 font=5\n\t\t\nN2 Grammar: k!quiz gn2 nd 20 mmq=3\n\t\t\nN1 Grammar: k!quiz gn1 nd 20 mmq=3\n\t\t\nN1 Listening: k!q ln1 10 nd font=5 mmq=2 atl=20\n\n**Overall thoughts on the JLPT?**\n\t\n1. I think if your ability is good enough, ie. you can actually just read/listen to normal native material w/o needing to rely on Yomichan too much, then you really shouldn't have any problems with the test if you do a bit of practice to get used to the types of questions. \n\t\t\n\tI didn't use any specific \"reading strategy\". I just read the text and answered the questions in order. \n\t\t\n\tI finished the vocab/grammar/reading section in ~70 minutes and used my remaining 40 minutes to double check my answers to the vocab/grammar section and some of the tricker reading questions. \n\t\t\n\tI'm not a fan of the listening section because it isn't indicative of actual listening comprehension and is more of a \"memory test\": the test forces you to listen to and basically memorize minute long passages and then be able to recall minute details from within the middle of a conversation. My best advice would be to read the answers ahead of time (during the long pauses between questions), take scribbled notes, and cross stuff out as you listen. \n\t\n2. $100 is a bit expensive for a piece of paper.\n\t\n3. I wish there was an online version so that I didn't have to travel and pay for a hotel just to take a 3 hour test. \n\t\n**Going Forward in 2023**\n\t\nSo when I originally drafted up this article around the beginning of the year I had put my Japanese on \"maintenance mode\" and wasn't doing much more than watching an hour of YouTube and just keeping up with my Anki reviews, but not doing any new cards (so like ~15 min/day).\n\t\nI think taking a step away from Japanese for these two weeks helped me to evaluate what my goals are, as well as to reignite my passion for learning the language- I was honestly just a bit burnt out from finals and intense language learning, and the holidays were the perfect time to relax.\n\t\nDuring this two week \"sabbatical\", I was debating whether or not if I wanted to learn Spanish (and I even read a 200pg graded reader in Spanish), but then ultimately decided that I had a couple more goals with Japanese that I wanted to focus on this year (which I detail below).  \n\t\nI have the option to go live in Japan or Spain for the Navy after I graduate university, and am currently in the process of deciding where I want to go. \n\t\n**2023 Goals** \n\t\t\n1. *Reading Ability*\n\n\tI am aiming to complete at least one book per week. I combed through my \"to read\" list and picked out the top 50 books that I thought were interesting (after reading excertps/free samples on Amazon) for me to choose from, but I will also just add in/get rid of stuff as I come across new suggestions.\n\n\tThe novels that I've picked are mainly literary works from Aozora Bunko, mystery novels, and some non-fiction books; I specifically chose to not include too many LNs or VNs, which I've already read plenty of, in order to challenge my reading ability and continue to grow. \n\t\t\t\n\tAs mentioned above, I will probably adjust what I read based upon my mood as I go throughout the year, and will most definitely read some LNs and manga just for fun. \n\n2. *Pronunciation/Pitch*\n\n\tI've focused on pitch accent more than the average learner, but I never really went in depth on being able to actively recall the correct accent of words, and mainly trained my perception of it early on and then just did a lot of listening to native material. \n\t\t\t\n\tThis was really good for letting me able to \"hear the downstep\" while listening, but it didn't mean that I memorized the accent of individual words.\n\t\t\t\n\tIn fact, training this ability got me to around ~80% accurate reproduction of correct accent with words that I know. This may sound like a lot, but really, I still often mess up the pitch of words that \"I know\" becuase I never actively learned the correct accent when learning the words and instead just passively recogized what was being said. \n\n\tMy plan to improve my pronunciation and accent is 5 fold. \n\n\t*Finish rewatching Dogen's Pronunciation series* (currently like halfway done). \n\t\t\t\t\n\tI rushed through this series when I was a beginner but never really internalized the various different patterns, conjugations, etc. and more so got a \"broad overview\" of pitch accent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tI'm just watching about a video a day and making Anki \"Pronunciation cards\" to remember the accent of words/rules that I don't already know. \n\n\t*I reread the NHK accent dictionary* \n\t\t\t\t\n\tThis is my second time reading through the appendix (on the app version) of this fantastic resource, but I will need to make some \"pronunciation cards\" to remember the accent of compound nouns, counters, suffixes, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t*Pronunciation Cards in Anki* \n\t\t\t\t\n\tThis is simply to practice reading aloud and actively recalling the pitch accent of individual words/phrases/conjugations/various pitch rules that I encounter in all of the other steps. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tThese cards are super fast to rep (avg. of ~3s/card since they only test pronunciation) and should help me correctly say the accent of words that \"I know\" but have been saying with the wrong pitch accent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t*Pitch Focused Reading*\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tThis exercise is recommended by many people, such as Mui-Mui and Darius, and is a pronunciation exercise where you read aloud and are corrected by a native speaker (or use Yomichan/NHK/OJAD/Youglish to look up the accent of words/phrases that you are unsure of).\n\n\tThis is pretty much the main pronunciation exercise that people recommend because it forces you to actively recall and produce the correct accent for everything that you can read.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t*Repetitive Listening and Shadowing of audiobooks* that I read in step 4. \n\t\t\t\t\n\tI've actually done a fair bit of shadowing with podcasts, but I have never done it with audiobooks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tI think that combining shadowing and PFR in this manner will help give me more repitition with the words that I need to relearn and should be effective for improvement.\n\t\t\t\n3. *Kanken*\n\t\t\t\n\tThere is a great deck for learning how to write vocabulary words (and thus Kanji) for advanced learners of Japanese who are already confident in their reading ability and vocabulary: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/759825185\n\t\t\t\n\tI've been going through this deck (currently about ~400 cards in) and will look at taking 漢字検定2級 hopefully sometimes within a year or so, depending on how fast I go through the deck. \n\t\t\n4. This isn't really a goal, but I'm going to finish sentence mining the Dictionary of Advanced Japanese Grammar just to finish the series.\n\t\t\n5. *More speaking and writing*\n\t\t\n\tI've always slacked on speaking and writing simply because most of my learning is done through self-study. \n\t\t\t\n\tWhile I do consider myself \"fluent\", as I am able to have full conversations in Japanese without much issue, I still would like to be able to speak with less mistakes, more ease, and more fluidity on a wider range of topics. \n\t\t\t\n\tI have done Italki lessons before, but haven't done them in a while, and should probably start doing them again. \n\n\tI know a great Japanese native on Italki who I have used before and like using, I just stopped doing the lessons because I'm a broke college student.\n\t\t\t\n\tFor writing, I need to look into various resources where I can get my submissions corrected on a regular basis (ideally for free if possible), but currently I am just posting on twitter (unfortunately, I don't really get any native corrections on here)\n\n**Resource Dump**\n\nThe resources I use for learning Japanese are all in my in-depth guide! Check it out: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LH82FjsCqCgp6-TFqUcS_EB15V7sx7O1VCjREp6Lexw/edit\n\nRandom immersion material that I found particularly helpful for learning more advanced topics. \n\nHistory Articles for middle schoolers: https://wakaru-rekisi.com/\n\t\nMore in depth History Articles: https://nihonsi-jiten.com/\n\nHere's a good news podcast that talks about politics/economics a lot: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCq8ulhTyxBdD6IVLyJHNFQ\n\nHere's a good Youtube channel for learning about history/religion/politics/war: https://www.youtube.com/@donttellmearai\n\t\t\nMiddle School Level 国語: https://www.kokugobunpou.com/#gsc.tab=0 \n\t\t\t\nI hope that everyone else had a good year of language learning in 2022 and good results on the JLPT if you took it: let me know how it went in the comments! \n\nFor those of you with questions, I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability.",

I thought it could be cool to learn about the current Japanese POV on Christianity by reading text *in Japanese* rather than Wikipedia pages in English talking about how Christianity in Japan differs from Christianity elsewhere, etc. \n\nI’m still relatively new to reading stuff in Japanese, and I still am unfamiliar with like ~1200 of the jōyō kanji (I’m about to reach level 28 in WaniKani tomorrow) so something with furigana is ideal. “Easier” reads are ideal too, but I’m okay with something that requires me to reference a dictionary often if it’s interesting.\n\nThis could be anything from a Japanese edition of the Bible, to Biblical stories / events told in Japanese, or like, anything else. I’d prefer if it was something that was written by Japanese people for a Japanese audience and not a direct translation of an English text(s). \n\nI know very little about Christianity (this is probably clear from how broadly I’m speaking about the subject); my knowledge of the religion and its various sects are pretty limited, as I grew up Jewish. From what I know, I think Bible stories are interesting; I’ve had exposure to a bunch of those in synagogue when I was younger.\n\nOnline reading works for me, but I’m okay with buying a book too, if there isn’t a free version available online to read.\n\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated.

        "text": "わけ is an expression all Japanese students eventually encounter, sooner or later (usually sooner,  as わけではない, is often used in anime). The more we encounter it, the more confusing it becomes - a tough nut to crack. Especially since the explanations in textbooks are often not clear. But this post is here to help you. \n\nIf you go through it, you will be able to understand various わけ nuances. \n\nSo let's start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What わけ is?**\n\nわけ (訳) is a noun that is used to denote determination, conclusion, or reason and all of the uses are extensions of these meanings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**By the way**, if you like posts like this then you can follow me on Reddit to get info about new posts like this one :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConjugations:\n\nverb + わけ　｜ verb + というわけ\n\nいAdjective + わけ ｜ いAdjective + というわけ\n\nなAdjective + な + わけ | なAdjective + （だ）+ というわけ\n\nNoun + な + わけ | Noun + （だ）+ というわけ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The most confusing is わけだ - as it has few basic uses: stating reason, natural consequence, conclusion, or restating/summarizing something previously said.** \n\nThese basic uses **can be used in two types of situations**, which is what confuses learners (seriously, they are very confusing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The first is when the speaker uses わけ as a reaction to what his conversation partner says (both parts are active in dialogue), and the second is when the speaker performs a monologue, for example when explaining something to his conversation partner.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**By the way,**\n\n**わけだ can be replaced with というわけだ(ってわけ）without changing the meaning, the latter is more often used with なAdjectives and nouns.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Responses to conversation partner utterances type:**\n\n**わけだ that's why, no wonder**\n\nUsed when someone understands the reason or cause of something he/she was wondering about, based on something heard from another person. Something becomes clear to the speaker after hearing new information. This usage requires a conversation partner statement, so it is used in dialogue.\n\nOften used together with だから、それで、なるほど、やっぱり。\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「ゴードン・ラムゼイこのケーキを焼いたんだ。」\n\n「本当？ だからおいしいわけよね。」\n\n\"Gordon Ramsey has baked this cake.\"\n\n\"Really? No wonder it is so good.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「長瀞が風邪ひいちゃった。」\n\n「あぁ、だから今日部に来なかったわけだね。」\n\n\"Nagatoro caught flu.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is why she did not come to the club today, right?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「僕の父が事故に遭った。」\n\n「ばるほど、それで心配そうな顔してるわけだ。」\n\nAfter seeing the friend's worried face (and starting to wonder about the reason, the friend says:) \n\n\"My dad had an accident.\"\n\n\"I see, so that's why you look worried.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**わけだ Oh I see, so you mean, in other words**\n\nUsed when restating or summarizing what other person has said. Often appears together with つまり。\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「彼は来週から、ジムへ通い始めるらしい。」\n\nI heard that he would start going to the gym next week.\n\n「つまり、彼はやせたいわけだ。」\n\nIn other words, he wants to lose weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「娘はいつも授業の勉強が大変だと文句を言ってる。」\n\n\"My daughter always complains about how much she has to study for her classes.\"\n\n「つまり、勉強が嫌いなわけだ。」\n\nIn a word, she hates studying, doesn't she?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**わけだ because, since, so**\n\nUsed to state the reason for what the conversation partner has said. Often to make someone understand the facts of a situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「田中さんが亡くなったそうだ。」\n\n「本当？心臓発作だったというわけだな。」\n\n\"I have heard that Tanaka-san has died recently.\"\n\n\"Really? That must have been a heart attack.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Monologue:**\n\n**わけだ naturally, that's why, so**\n\nUsed to indicate that something is a natural (inevitable) consequence of something, which is mentioned first and followed by phrases like から or ので. Often used when the speaker explains something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n年齢とともに骨が弱くなり、骨折しやすくなるわけだ\n\nWith age, the bones get weaker, so it gets easier to break them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n日本に20年住んでいたので、日本語が完璧というわけだ。\n\nHe has lived for over twenty years in Japan, so his Japanese is perfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A。Bわけだ。**\n\nUsed to restate or summarize, often when explaining something to a conversation partner.\n\n彼は母の弟の息子だ。つまり、私たちは従兄弟同士というわけだ。\n\nHe is my mother's younger brother's son. In other words, we are cousins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A。Bわけだ。**\n\nUsed to indicate that B is the reason for A.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nとつぜん500km離れた別の街に引っ越すことにした。恋に夢中だったわけだ。\n\nSuddenly she decided to move to another city 500 km away. Because she was madly in love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**わけがわからない does not make sense**\n\nUsed when something cannot be understood by the speaker, and does not make sense.\n\nCan be contracted to わけわかんない.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nあなたの話は　わけがわからないわ。\n\nYour story does not make sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n彼がいうことは僕にはわけがわからないよ。\n\nWhat he says makes no sense to me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**わけだから since, because**\n\n Used to describe a conclusion that is logically drawn based on evidence. Generally used in Aわけだから〜B当然 pattern, indicating that B should happen, because A is the case. Often it is used when speaking about people other than the speaker (or to make the statement more objective when speaking about oneself.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nあなたは皆から選ばれたわけだから、頑張るのは当然だ。\n\nYou were chosen by all of us, so it is only natural that you should work hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n彼らは他者の土地にモノをつくろうとするわけだから、軋轢が生まれるのは当然です。\n\nSince they are trying to build things on other people's land, it is natural that aversion would be born.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nわけではない it is not the case, it does not mean that \n\nわけでもない is also common. Can be contracted to わけじゃない。\n\nIt has two basic uses:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**①わけではない**\n\nUsed to deny what someone can conclude or think (denies the wrong conclusion). It can be used as a euphemistic negation (for example when we don't want to be rude to a superior at work, or a client or circumstances do not allow it for some reason). Often used with 特に (especially)、べつに(particularly)、からといって (just because).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n猫が好きだが、飼ってるわけではない。\n\nI like cats but it doesn't mean I keep one.\n\n(Used when conversation partner might assume that speaker has a cat because he is so good with them etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n物価が高いからといって泥棒をしてもいいわけではないよ！\n\nJust because prices are high doesn't mean it's okay to steal!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA: 「Cさんは日本に十年以上住んでる。日本語が上手だろうね。」 B：「日本に長い間住んでも、日本語を話せるわけではないよ。」\n\nA: \"C has been living in Japan for over ten years. His Japanese is probably amazing, right?\"\n\nB: \"Even if he has lived in Japan for a long time it doesn’t mean he can speak Japanese.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n川は美しいからといって危なくないわけではない。\n\nJust because a river is beautiful does not mean that it is not dangerous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n上司「この商品は大人気だろう。」\n\n部下「顧客は別にこのようなものを気に入っているわけではないと思いますが」\n\nBoss \"This product will likely be a hit.\"\n\nSubordinate \"However I think that consumers don't like products like these .\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n患者「田中先生のおかげで僕は前よりずっと元気になったんですよ。」\n\n田中先生「元気になっても病気が治ったわけではありません。」\n\nPatient \"Thanks to you, Dr.Tanaka I feel much better than I did.\"\n\nDr. Tanaka \"Even if you get better, it does not mean that the illness is cured.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**②わけではない**\n\nUsed when something cannot be entirely negated (partial negation).\n\nOften used with phrases like 全部 (all)、みんな (everyone)、いつも(always)、誰でも(everyone)、必ずしも(not necessarily)  etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「最初から　ウソ*ばかり*だ」\n\n「全部がウソってわけじゃないけど、ときどき言ったことはウソだった。」\n\n\"He did nothing but lie from the very beginning.\"\n\n\"It does not mean that everything was a lie, but sometimes he lied.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n全員がそう思ってたわけじゃないけどね。\n\nIt is not like all of us think so. (Some do not.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n「料理の仕方がわからないね。」\n\n「料理することができないわけではない。」\n\n\"You don't know how to cook, right?\"\n\nIt is not like I cannot cook. (I can cook, but not well.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes the exact meaning (1 or ２) depends on context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nというわけではない\n\nExactly like わけではない, but can appear directly after adverbs, particles, volitional form, and quotations and seem to be more commonly used \\*\\*with nouns and なadjectives\\*\\* instead of なわけではない construction. In other words, it is more permissive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n私は映画が好きというわけではないが、月に2 、3 つは見る。\n\nIt is not like I like movies, but I see them 2,3 times a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n今私は完璧に幸せというわけではない。\n\nIt is not like I am completely happy right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nスタートアップになろうというわけではない。\n\nIt is not like we are trying to become a start-up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nkappazonが電子読本を販売する最初の会社というわけではないが初めて成功した。\n\nKappazon is not the first company to push e-readers on market, but the first to succeed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nわけがない impossible\n\nUsed to emphasize that something is impossible to happen (lit. there is no reason for something to happen). In casual speech shortened to わけない。Usually does not follow past form. can be replaced with はずがない (and unlike わけがない can follow past form)。\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nあの墜落で生きてるわけがない。\n\nIt is impossible to survive that crash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nこんな事が起きるわけがない。\n\nSuch a thing can't happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n彼を信じないわけがない。\n\nThere is no reason to not trust him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nわけない　hassle-free, easy, hands down, naturally\n\nAn old-fashioned expression used to express that something is really simple. Do not confuse with わけない, contraction of わけがない. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nこの問題を解くのはわけない。\n\nSolving this problem is easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nどんなスポーツでも彼にはわけなくできる。\n\nSports always come naturally to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nわけにはいかない cannot do, must not\n\nLit. \"cannot do something\", unlike for example potential form or ことができる implies that the speaker cannot do something due to some reason, for example, social obligation, binding contract, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n会社は赤字だから、これ以上お金を失うわけにはいかない。\n\nOur company budget is in the red, we can't afford to lose any more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n俺には大事な人がいるから死ぬわけにはいかないんだ！\n\nI can't die, I have someone important to me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nないわけにはいかない no other choice but to\n\nLit. meaning \"one can not do something\", implies that the speaker feels a sense of responsibility or duty to do something, for example, due to social obligation, past experiences, or current circumstances. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n弟の結婚式なので、出席しないわけにはいかない。\n\nSince it is the wedding of my younger brother I have no other choice but to attend it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n上司だから彼の意見に耳を傾けないわけにはいかない。\n\nSince he is my superior, I have no choice but to listen to his opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is all folks,\n\nI am mrnoone and that was 'not so' brief Japanese.\n\nIf you are curious about more posts like this, you can follow me on Reddit :&gt;\n\nAnyone would be interested in stuff like this in form of youtube videos?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[All my articles are archivized on my blog](https://briefjapanese.fun/)",
