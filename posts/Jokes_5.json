Eventually, they come across a herd of elk walking through the forest. \n\nWith his superior vision, the dad spies a sick-looking elk stumbling near the back of the herd, looking like it's ready to drop over dead at any moment. \n\n\"See that old, sick one at the back? We'll follow the herd for a while, and as soon as it falls, we'll swoop down and eat. But not a minute before. And once it does fall, we'll need to be fast, to make sure we get the first pickings.\"\n\nThey follow the herd for about twenty minutes, but the sick elk is still managing to hobble along.\n\n\"*Daaad*,\" whines the son. \"This is taking too long. When is it going to fall?\"\n\n\"Soon,\" says the dad. \"You have to be patient.\"\n\nThey continue flying and following the herd, but the stubborn sick elk is still hanging on. \n\nMuch to the dad's annoyance, his son begins wandering off, becoming more interested in chasing butterflies through the air instead of focusing on the herd.\n\n\"Son!\" He yells. \"Get back here! When the elk falls, you need to be ready!\" His son groans and reluctantly returns to his side.\n\nFive minutes later, the dad notices his son has wandered off again, flying even farther away this time. He yells for him to return, and once again he reluctantly flies back.\n\nAt this point, the dad is expecting the elk to fall at any second. He is focusing so hard on it, he doesn't even notice that his son is wandering away again. When he looks up, his son has flown so far away he can barely see him. \n\n\"Son, get back here! Hurry!\" He glances back down, just in time to see the elk give a final shudder and fall to the ground.\n\n\"Carrion, my wayward son!\"",

Back you fiend!\"\n\nThe vampire lets out a low chuckle and says,\n\"Nu, gornisht helfn bubele.\"\n\n\nNote: I first heard a version of this joke from my father and then a couple of years ago was shocked to hear an abbreviated version of it in the HBO show The Outsider (the episode it appears in is even named after the joke!). But googling around I couldn't find a good \"original\" version of it, so I tried to work backwards and construct a basic, rule of threes type of structure for it. I'm not saying this is the absolute funniest way to tell the joke, but it fits what I think of as the typical structure of this type of gag. I welcome feedback.\n\nAlso, the title/setup of the joke maybe spoils it a bit, but I've heard it referenced that way and it seems like a good seo strategy to include it.",

After 15 minutes, the officer stops by.\n\n“Son I’m changing your post to the mess hall. Go in there and start drying some washed dishes.”\n\nMy son again obeys, and heads to the mess hall. He’s wiped about 9 dishes when the officer walks up again.\n\n“Listen here recruit, your new post is in the supply room. I need you to make sure everything is stocked up in case we are hit with another wave of pandemic.”\n\nMy son again follows orders, and heads off to the supply room. There, he sees a old army personnel, moving some boxes.\n\n“Hey there,” says my son. “is it normal to keep getting reassigned to new posts all day? I haven’t kept one position for more than 15 minutes!”\n\nThe old man says “Oh yeah- this sub is full of reposts.”",
