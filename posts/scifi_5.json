I think you call it your supine surface? Or perhaps a pair, or a trine of mirrors would be more effective. But perhaps humans cannot interoperate an image scattered that far. Rolls a little your binocular vision should help with that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nHuman Friend Mercy‚Äôs hands had slowed in their soothing repetitive motions and the light show dimmed allowing the perhifreial sparks to dance more clearly.  Her head slowly turned her face towards the Undulate in the tank revealing that she had sacrificed the bilateral symmetry of her face to get a proper visual sounding of the scene. It was, Rotates With Decision had been led to believe, a gesture of lack of understanding and mental effort to understand.\n\n‚ÄúSay way lil‚Äô gal?‚Äù Human Friend Mercy drawled out.\n\n‚ÄúI will ask again once you have completed what you are doing,‚Äù Rotates With Decision said. ‚ÄúDo you mind if I deliberately observe with all of my appendages?\n\n‚ÄúWatch as much as you want,‚Äù the human replied with a graceful, almost Undulate dip of her shoulders.\n\nA shrug, Rotates With Decision believed it was called, one of the more normal movements the massive bipeds produced from their numerous joints. Rotates With Decision gave a hum of gratitude and spread her appendages to observe the brilliant light show. She wondered idly why none of her companions with more human experience had ever mentioned this marvel.\n\nThe brush, a mass printed device that resembled the algae agitators she used back home in the growth pools, was gripped firmly in the humans dominant hand while she used her non-dominant hand to direct the fall of the thread thin fibers that grew out of her caudal end. The human had begun the meditative devotion by freeing the thousands of strands from the cloth band that restrained them and now the band  clung snugly one of the larger joints on her arm. Then she had started using the teeth of the brush at the lagging end of the fibers to tease out the tangles exactly as one had to loosen the more fibrous algae back home.\n\nThe moment the printed material of the brush had touched the fibers a shower of brilliant sparks had erupted from the contact. As Human Friend Mercy had worked the brush up the length of her fibers the showers of sparks had grown in number and density until the flowing mass of fibers was a veritable cascade of dancing light. When all of the tangles were worked out of the fibers the human had worked up a steady rhythm that filled the room with the sparking light.\n\nThe beauty, the light, the rhythm, the softly chanted tune that Rotates With Decision couldn‚Äôt quite make out, everything about the wondrous scene before her spoke of a religious devotion. Even if Rotates With Decision hadn‚Äôt had the chance to see the ancient human religious art on display she would have recognized the holiness of the moment. As it was the tradition of putting a circle representing light around the head of humans in religious devotion suddenly made so much more sense.\n\nRotates With Decision suddenly realized that that chanting was actually the decamarked counting form the humans used. Human Friend Mercy was counting up by ones and was somewhere in the mid sixties. Rotates With Decision wondered which human prayers had that many beats. She had been somewhat under the impression that nightly prayers were usually shorter. She wondered suddenly if it had been rude to interrupt the prayer. Humans were oddly solitary creatures sometimes. True, Human Friend Mercy hadn‚Äôt appeared to be offended, but the human was probably too agreeable to express such a thing even if it was inconvenient to her.\n\nThe pace of the prayer was picking up in anticipation of the end count and Human Friend Mercy was briskly dragging the brush through the full length of the strands, catching the mass in her non-dominant hand and guiding the mass through the tines of the brush. The resulting light show almost obscured the dancing fibers in its glow. Human Friend Mercy reached a count of one-hundred and finished with a powerful stroke that made the room glow. Rather than bask in the accumulated light she parted the sparkling strands down the center of her caudal end and began quickly braiding the two halves into the side braids she had explained were the most comfortable for sleep. Showers of sparks fell from her fingers and lit on her shoulders before extinguishing in the ambient vapor. The human finished the task and dropped the brush on the shelf before giving a little hop and landing on her bunk.\n\n‚ÄúWhat was that question you asked Rotates?‚Äù Human Friend Mercy asked as she shifted in the usual human search for a comfortable position.\n\n‚ÄúPrimarily I wanted to know why you have not arranged for a view of your, dorsal I believe, surface during the prayer time,‚Äù Rotates With Decision said.\n\nHuman Friend Mercy stopped shifting with her pillow clutched in her hands and stared at Rotates With Decision with the fluctuating gaze that indicated deep thought.\n\n‚ÄúWhat prayer now?‚Äù Human Friend Mercy asked with confusion clear in her tones.\n\n‚ÄúThe counting prayer you just preformed at the mirror,‚Äù Rotates With Decision said, gesturing towards the reflective surface.\n\n‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt a religious thing,‚Äù Human Friend Mercy said slowly. ‚ÄúIt was a hygiene thing. It distributes the oils properly though my hair so the oils produced at the base of the strands can reach all the way to the tips. It also prevents insects from nesting in the braids and dislodges any dirt. I count to make sure I give sufficient time to the task.‚Äù\n\nRotates With Decision positively wriggled in surprise.\n\n‚ÄúSuch astounding beauty produced from a merely hygienic process!‚Äù she exclaimed. ‚ÄúHow delightful, but surely even so you would want to view the full effect of the light flow?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe what now?‚Äù Human Friend Mercy said, but was interrupted by a yawn.\n\n‚ÄúI can ask you about it in the morning,‚Äù Rotates With Decision said as she slipped back into the tank.\n\n‚ÄúGood idea,‚Äù Human Friend Mercy said and she shifted position to begin sleep.\n\nHowever after a moment her arm lifted from her side and dropped across her caudal end in a pose that usually indicated thoughtfulness rather than restfulness.\n\n‚ÄúYo‚Äô Rotates,‚Äù Human Friend Mercy called out with another yawn. ‚ÄúThink I got it. My and my sister would sometimes brush our hair in the dark to see the sparks it made. I bet you can see ‚Äòem even without it being pitch black.‚Äù\n\nThe human voice had wandered off into sleep and her arm dropped to her side so Rotates With Decision did not bother perusing the matter. There was always tomorrow. She stared at the lingering glow in the braids that fell over the human‚Äôs shoulders in fascination. Was it possible a species could produce such beauty without realizing it?\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [‚ÄãBook Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/n59b1913ztla1.gif",

Envoy's for an alien super power arrive at a space station run by other aliens (no humans)\n2. Those that arrive are Envoy's or Emissaries of a Blue-Skin alien galactic super power\n3. A lone human man finds himself in a slave pin on the station\n4. The Envoy's do a tour of the space station and find the human looks a lot like them\n5. They acquire the human in hopes to study him to determine if \"humans\" could be useful as a servitor.\n6. A bunch of stuff happens and the human man gets pulled into a political intrigue when one of the male blue-skin aliens goes rogue or AWOL, on some planet, and he has to help track him down.\n\nNotable features\n\n1. The human gets a training (pain) device put on him when he becomes too disobedient\n2. The blue-skin aliens are super strong, in that an accidentally slap could shatter every bone in a human body\n3. There is some sort of frog or toad-like humanoid race that is superhuman in strength who works for the blue skin aliens, but the blue skin aliens are even stronger than them\n4. There are some kids the human tries to save\n5. This book is sci-fi, not a comedy. There is no time travel. Humans are not superpowers, they are barely mentioned in the book at all. The only reason why the male human was in the slave pin was that his ship got raided or broke down, down remember which. There are no \"cat people\". The first half of the story is on board the blue skin alien ship. The later part is on a planet in which the blue skin alien male is governor or something like that. There is no galactic war. The blue-skin alien race is a matriarchy, and when they go into mating seasons, they become violent (there is a whole explanation in the book about the political complications and implications during mating seasons. The blue skin aliens look humanoid.",

        "title": "Ideas For Experiments Into Human Four-Dimensionality?",
        "author": "Ahruzimel",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/11i9v61/ideas_for_experiments_into_human/",
        "text": " Hey folks,\n\nSo, lately I've been really interested in the concept of human four-dimensionality. In the setting where I run my ttrpg, there is a deep conspiracy, involving multiple factions, comprised of a vast network of experiments - kind of MK Ultra style, except that instead of trying to use LSD as a mind control drug, these experiments are trying to work out a process whereby you could convert a human into four-dimensionality.\n\nPresumably, a four-dimensional being would have godlike power. They could see all sides of an object or person at once, including inside them. They could reach into you without breaking your skin. They could step \"over\" and \"around\" walls, and move through time just as easily as space. They would be like teleporters, telekinetics, and prognosticators to an extreme. I'm sure there are other abilities and senses they would have that I haven't thought of yet! It's not hard to imagine why various factions would want to unlock this secret.\n\nWhat I'm stumped on, though, is what sorts of experiments they might undertake. This all began - as these things often do - in the bottom of a mine on an industrial world, where the miners uncovered a piece of ancient alien tech that sort of funneled spacetime down into a current, which was used for interstellar travel. Being around that warping of spacetime started to change the miners' bodies such that they could interact with the world four-dimensionally, but they didn't understand what was happening to them and it drove them into these maniacal mutants that I called Tesseracted Men. Limbs splitting off at right angles at every joint. It was a cool body horror session.\n\nSo, that \"experiment\" had some promising, if ultimately unsuccessful, results. Now I'm not sure where our evil scientists would go from there. I would really appreciate any ideas that come to mind of what sort of experiments this network of scientists might undertake when a shadowy intelligence organization shows up with a whole briefcase of cash to fund their research.\n\nAny ideas?",

        "text": "And we‚Äôre back to the show being good again. Really good. I feel like I‚Äôve got whiplash.\n\nEpisode 2 had a lot of flaws I associate with Nu Trek‚Äôs writing, including a few (such as its depiction of the relationships between officers in a hierarchy) that especially annoy me. Professionalism is a backbone of how I see Star Fleet officers interact. When you have that expectation, it makes the breakdown or change of that relationship a lot more powerful ‚Äì in the right context. Picard and Crusher in TNG starting their day together with breakfast and a good argument shows that they are close, dropping the pretensions of rank and being friends. Picard giving unlawful orders and having them obeyed makes Shaw inconsistent. Something as simple as a cut to Shaw on the line ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my son‚Äù showing a look of horror and resolution on his face could add a lot to Shaw‚Äôs character and provide a justification for him playing along with Picard- he recognises that Picard is now operating on very fundamental protective instincts. Maybe instincts Shaw understands all too well (hintatpossiblybeingaparenthimself)? But as it strands it simply contradicts the show‚Äôs own presentations of Shaw, and Picard‚Äôs authority. This sort of context can be applied retroactively of course. But without something in the moment to highlight that this is a contradiction (example, crew looking to Shaw to see if he belays the order) is a good idea to get the moment noticed so it‚Äôs remembered when that recontextualization comes.\n\nI bring this up because many of the best parts of Episode 3 revolve around interpersonal relationships with rank playing a second fiddle. I don‚Äôt want to create the impression I think Starfleet officers should be autonoma, just mindless gears clacking out their roles in a hierarchical machine. That would be utterly antithetical to Star Trek. You can‚Äôt have your competence porn without the characters (being competent people) facing challenges. This is especially so for a character like Picard for whom forming personal relationships with people was a challenge. His starting to do that in All Good Things by attending the poker game was a great character moment on which to end the TNG series. He‚Äôs concluded an arc of opening up to people and now begins the arc of what that actually means and how to do it- not easy for a man so intensely private. It‚Äôs an ending that provides both a satisfying personal conclusion but acknowledges the reality that personal growth never ends- even if the show has. It feels real. Episode 3 is the best I‚Äôve seen yet at picking up those threads and convincingly following them.\n\nEpisode 3 opens (after a preamble of escaping the Shrike) with Picard and Riker sat (de aged with a questionable special effect) in a bar sharing a drink. Riker talks about fatherhood, setting up one of the pillars of the episode. Picard cracks a joke in the form of a friendly insult which made me smile. That is something TNG Picard would never have done. But in this case, this context, with this character at this time decades after TNG (in and out of universe) it‚Äôs an example of character growth rather than character inconsistency. He‚Äôs changed and done something he simply wouldn‚Äôt have done if he was being written as the character he was. But it‚Äôs also a natural change in his character from where we left him in All Good Things (I‚Äôm ignoring the movies but that‚Äôs a whole other mess). It feels real, feels like this is the real Picard decades after his adventures- older and if not wiser then at least able to open up and have true friendships rather than hiding behind his rank and his authoritative style of command. \n\nThe direction and writing is spot on too, the pair putting out big ‚Äòbest mate‚Äô energy without it being over done. Picard is still Picard- he‚Äôs not gushing over Riker while six pints to the wind talking about how he‚Äôs his best mate and makes Picard a better man. Just two guys bonding over a drink in the way that many guys do. Perfect.\n\nOkay I‚Äôve got one nitpick- Troi sounds weirdly Irish. But I‚Äôm strangely okay with it. As I am with an Irish accent in general‚Ä¶\n\nAnother great personal moment occurs with the inevitable ‚Äòwhy the hell didn‚Äôt you tell me I had a son‚Äô conversation between Picard and Crusher. The writing is spot on, the escalation of the argument is smooth and believable, and Stewart and McFadden both bring their A game to the performance. Crusher makes a pretty good case for why she never told him and Stewart balances the natural outrage against Picard‚Äôs self-control very well. I‚Äôve not got a great sense of who Crusher is now outside of that context (discounting second hand implication of which there‚Äôs been a fair bit), but I hope it‚Äôs coming and she gets the same quality shown to Picard and Riker.\n\nA note on Stewart. In the episode 2 write up I said he was just too old. Well I have to eat my words at least in part. Episode 3 is his best performance in this season (possibly the entire series- but I skipped all but 2.5 episodes of season 2), he‚Äôs in character and he feels like an old man character rather than an old man trying to act and fluffing his delivery because his throat his worn out. I can see a couple of reasons for this- better direction is a distinct possibility. Frakes is directing this episode and he has experience not only acting with Stewart but also directing him. The other possibility is more takes and edits. More opportunities for an actor to get the line right and strike that balance. While I still think Stewart‚Äôs performance in episode 2 was kind of bad, I‚Äôm now more of the opinion it was down to insufficient takes or poor direction rather than Stewart being over the hill. Time will tell if he (or the production) can keep this up, but Stewart demonstrates in this episode he can still bring it. In the meantime it‚Äôs a salient lesson in how a bad performance is not always the fault of the performer- something I mentioned back in my episode 1 write up. And probably should have applied.\n\nWe get to see Riker slip easily into the role of ‚Äòcool uncle‚Äô for Jack Crusher, dispensing worldly wisdom with a grin and an easy lean. There isn‚Äôt much to say here apart from moments like this being peak Riker. Riker uses a friendly, easy going manner to get people to trust him and like him. It‚Äôs established in a TNG episode this is very much deliberate and his style of command, but is also just kind of who he is. Picard by contrast put on an act to create an air of mystique and confidence to inspire loyalty and obedience. Not exactly ruling with fear over love, but closer to fear than love. Riker has probably changed the least, but he has changed. His competitive almost combative edge has been honed into a retractable claw to be used when needed. For the most part what‚Äôs left is an easy going man with a friendly and happy demeanour. \n\n*Sigh* Then there‚Äôs Recap Raffi. I swear these scenes are being written by a completely different writer. We open with Raffi unconscious following the events of the previous episode, with a news broadcast on right next to her head reminding us of the story so far. I guess Worf put it there to‚Ä¶ err‚Ä¶ make sure she didn‚Äôt get nervous while he was out of the house? You can call this a nitpick but it‚Äôs emblematic of the sort of writing problems that have plagued Nu Trek and which Picard S3 has for the most part managed to move past- so when they pop up like this it makes them all the more jarring. The episode itself started with a literal recap. This feels like the writer assuming I‚Äôm too stupid or forgetful to remember/pay attention to something that only got recapped 20 minutes ago. I can appreciate the need to make sure your audience is able to follow what‚Äôs going on, but this isn‚Äôt a complicated espionage plot or an investigation putting together very different but related events. It‚Äôs not season 1 of the Expanse. The writer seems to think it is, but so far every event in this ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô has been a simple straight line. That isn‚Äôt a bad thing but it is annoying that large parts of the Raffi scenes are dedicated to recapping a plot that just doesn‚Äôt warrant it. Hrud demonstrated in Episode 1 that she can act this role well. I want to see more of that but writers won‚Äôt let her deliver!\n\nWorf is introduced into this plot as well and Michael Dorn does a fine job. There‚Äôs not been anything particularly dramatic or intense for Worf yet, but what we see again makes sense for the same character decades on. A common theme for Worf in TNG was struggling to balance his Klingon nature and desire to adhere to Klingon culture, with his decision to live among humans and work for the Federation which has different cultural values. There‚Äôs an episode where (not to spoiler it too much) Worf is entitled to kill someone under Klingon law through right of vengeance. He does so. As far as the Klingons are concerned this was a lawful death so Worf isn‚Äôt in any trouble- legally or socially. But that also means he as a Federation officer killed someone- in vengeance- without so much as a trial. Picard himself takes a very dim view of this. So that character deciding to ‚Äòwork on himself‚Äô and become more‚Ä¶ err‚Ä¶ peaceful, makes sense to me. Much like Picard making a friendly insult to Riker over a glass of whiskey, both are examples of the character being very different, but in ways that make sense for older, more seasoned versions of those TNG era characters.\n\nThe rest of the episode is mostly Wrath of Khan style space battle stuff.  The Shrike is hunting the Titan, the Titan tries to escape the nebula and warp away but the Shrike has Chell‚Äôs portal gun and keeps redirecting them back into the Nebula. The Shrike is also somehow able to track the Titan despite the nebula frying both ship‚Äôs sensors- leaving the crew of the Titan with a mystery to solve. \n\nThis stuff is for the most part well done. The ‚Äòvibe‚Äô of ships and submarines is captured well. Little details like Shaw stationing crew to ‚Äòlook out of the window‚Äô given the sensors don‚Äôt work helps this. Actual engagements are more drawn out with intense exchanges of fire between big ponderous space craft, rather than every ship moving like a fighter. I‚Äôm not sure how the gas leak inside the ship is leaving a trail the Shrike can track from outside the ship without there being some sort of hull breach you‚Äôd think the ship‚Äôs systems would detect- but whatever. When there‚Äôs other really good stuff present I care much less about these sorts of details. To be clear the leak is still a bit sloppy and requires some headcanon. But to go back to the analogy I established in episode 1 these errors are dings in the bodywork rather than cracks in the axle. The broad strokes of the story still work and the errors don‚Äôt contradict the story so far. But still some exposition along the lines of ‚Äòthe gas is getting out through a pinhole breach of which we have dozens, and is easily detected by sensors even in tiny amounts‚Äô wouldn‚Äôt have hurt. There‚Äôs no need to get completely Andy Weir about it, but a little something would have been nice. When I‚Äôm talking about things that merely stopped the episode being great through, the point still stands that the space battles were well done.\n\nA positive nitpick too- I really like the depiction of Shaw‚Äôs injury. Dark blood caked over his teeth, blood continually dripping from his mouth as he tries to talk and move, coupled with a great performance from Stashwick really sells the idea of a serious injury that is getting actively worse while you‚Äôre watching. Dark, gory (ish) and well deployed to enhance the space battles.\n\nAnd another one- I like Frake‚Äôs camera direction. It‚Äôs not revolutionary but his work covers all the basics while still finding time to get a cool shot in here and there.\n\nVadic‚Äôs depiction is also a little more in line with what I hoped for in the episode 2 write up- but she‚Äôs only on screen for brief flashes at a time. Still in those moments she comes off more as ‚Äòfocused and cracked‚Äô rather than hammy. She‚Äôs more Montablanc‚Äôs Khan and less Saturday Morning cartoon villain. If they keep her toned down a little from the initial presentation with the ‚Äòwacky‚Äô speech pattern and mannerisms being an indicator of intense emotional states- I think we could have a really good villain on our hands.\n\nI‚Äôm still on board with this season. While I don‚Äôt care for episode 2, episode 1 was pretty good stuff and episode 3 is getting into great territory. For the first time in a very long time I am genuinely looking forward to the next episode. I want to see what happens next, and for the most part I‚Äôve accepted these characters as the older versions of those TNG characters I enjoyed so much. The lighting still sucks but that isn‚Äôt going to change. I‚Äôm noticing a lot of minor details that are wrong but episode 2 aside these issues are mostly swept away by the core of the show being good. I‚Äôm now not concerned with the season turning out bad overall and  more slightly apprehensive about getting some more of the sorts of errors that killed episode 2 for me.",

        "text": "I‚Äôve encountered a lot of very friendly and helpful people within the audio drama community. This has only increased since I have begun work on my own audio drama. So, with that in mind, I thought I‚Äôd give back to an audio drama that offered its help to me. And by give back, I mean write a review. \n\nBrave New Frontiersman is set in an alternate version of 18th Century Colonial America. This version of North America is a land filled with magic and mythical creatures. You have creatures from the Old World, such as banshees and trolls, but also creatures from the New World, such as Sasquatch and Raven Mockers. Our hero is simply known as The Frontiersman. He travels across the frontier to aid those in need of help. He is joined by his old fur trapping companion Coyote. Along the way, they pick up a noble named Jame Byron, who has an aptitude for magic. Our three heroes will travel the frontier and encounter many strange creatures and strange magics. \n\nI had known about Brave New Frontiersman for a while. Recently, however, I was contacted by the Brave New Frontiersman Twitter account. They had seen my casting call for my upcoming audio dram The Books of Thoth, and wanted to know if I needed people sent my way. I already cast the roles for the first three episodes, but I‚Äôll certainly keep them in mind for future episodes. I also figured it would be nice if I gave them a review. \n\nBrave New Frontiersman is alternate history. Obviously, there‚Äôs the magic and mythical creatures bit, but there‚Äôs other aspects as well. One episode begins with the characters reading a newspaper. From this, we learn that the Aztec Empire still fell to Spanish Conquest. However, it did so in the 18th Century, rather than the 16th Century, and rather recently in terms of when the story takes place. We also learn that the Seven Years War, known to Americans as the French and Indian War, lasted twenty years in the world of Brave New Frontiersman. I guess it will be called the Twenty Years War instead. \n\nBrave New Frontiersman being set in the 18th Century, and dealing with the frontier, immediately made me think of the Leatherstocking Tales by James Fenimore Cooper. The most famous book in the series being The Last of the Mohicans. \n\nThe frontier has always had a special place in the mythology of America. I‚Äôm reminded of when Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on their famous expedition. He asked them to bring back a wooly mammoth, as many people believed that mammoths still roamed the lands of the Louisiana Purchase. Well, obviously, they didn‚Äôt have much luck finding a live mammoth. However, they did find a fossilized mammoth tusk. Brave New Frontiersman taps into that mythologized notion of the frontier as ‚Äúhere be dragons‚Äù territory. \n\nThe keyword with Brave New Frontiersman is potential. There is a lot of potential in the characters and the setting. We‚Äôve got six episodes so far, and I feel a clear sense of improvement and progress as the episodes go on. I feel confident that Brave New Frontiersman will be able to keep up the momentum, and spread its wings even further in the future. And I certainly can‚Äôt wait to see where the adventure takes us next.\n\nHave you listen to Brave New Frontiersman?  If so, what did you think?\n\nLink to the full review on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-audio-file-brave-new-frontiersman.html?m=1",
