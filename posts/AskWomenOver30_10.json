I’m not looking for a relationship or anything casual atm and have been trying to focus on my career lately. \nOver the past year, I’ve noticed an interesting pattern. About 90% of people who hit on me (or make an attempt to) are males in their early 40s who are either married or in committed relationships. Most of them have kids too. They’re all absolutely shameless when it comes to messaging/calling/sending pictures as well. I used to think people wouldn’t be so careless if they decided to cheat but I guess this has changed. Last year I had been involved with a guy from abroad who (I later found out) was engaged and never told me about it in the first place. It crushed me. I feel so sorry for spouses and kids of these pathological cheaters. \n\nI have a couple of single friends (30+F) who have noticed the same pattern. Older friends (40+F) who are also single mostly haven’t had the same experience.\n\nWhat’s the reason behind infidelity and manipulating being so omnipresent in that particular age group? Why would these guys risk so much just for a casual hookup? Why do they go after single women in their 30s? Wouldn’t it be ‘safer’ for them to pursue married women who would keep an affair a secret?",

They don't party or something like that, but they probbaly walk barefoot and very loudly, they also move around furniture a lot and make other \"normal\" noises which we hear very well due to not the greatest sound proofing in the building. While that is fine during day time, I am having issues when they make these noises at night. Sometimes they go to bed at midnight and it's okay, sometimes it's 2 am and I cannot sleep until they stop making those noises so I end up sleeping only 5 hours as I have to get up for work (they dont seem to be working..) We tried to talk to them, but they are from another country and due to language barrier not sure if that helped much. I also left many notes during all this time, as well as slippers by their door, hoping they'd get the hint, but nothing changed. So I am wondering if I can inform police so that the owner would know? (we have this online system where you can inform police on minor misdemeanors) Or is it not okay if they are not partying but just basically living loudly? I don't want to be a bitch but it affects my anxiety and sleep sooooo much. I've been tracking and I have been losing sleep due to them at least once a week for almost a year now.

I can't really tell if I'm overprotecting myself, if I have unrealistically high standards / expect too much too soon, or if I'm seeing valid red flags.\n\nFor example there was a guy I connected with a lot and had so much fun with in conversations. He was kind, funny, I could tell he was very into me, well-educated, smart, compassionate. But,\n\n- He didn't ask any questions to get to know me better for months. Our conversations stayed on daily life, memes, sex, politics.\n\n- He's 35 and been living in the same city since he was 17. But the two people he called \"my best friends\" he has met them only a few years ago. He has little contact with one, almost none with another. He's super social though so it made me wonder if he just doesn't make meaningful connections with anyone or he's the type of person who changes his close social circle periodically.\n\n- He said he didn't believe in lifetime commitment because he doesn't find it realistic. Nor do I actually but I'm not sure if someone with anxiety disorder &amp; someone who says \"I might leave\" by default is a good match.\n\n- He said it was difficult for him to live with someone as he was \"too attached to his own space.\" So am I! But I again wondered why he would tell *me* this and not keep it to himself.\n\n- He still has a painting from his \"former fuck buddy/girlfriend from 5 years ago\" on his living room's wall AND they still follow each other on Instagram. He was even liking her sexy thirst trap pictures on social media when he was flirting with me online. We hadn't met in person then to be fair, it was online flirting. But I have no ex in my life or on social media that I don't have clear boundaries with. I don't think he would delete her even if we got relationship label after 5-6 years of knowing each other.\n\nI could continue but nothing worse.\n\nAre these valid dealbreakers you think? Or was it \"nobody is perfect, if he was treating you nicely it was worth a shot to date for a while?\"\n\nWhere do YOU draw the line between self-overprotection vs spotting red flags if you don't trust your gut feeling?",

        "text": "Hi ladies, I (31F) have found myself in a state of indecision regarding one of the biggest decisions of my life - moving abroad. For context, I’m single, living at home (totally normal and acceptable in my culture), no major responsibilities (debt, mortgage, etc.), at a job that is cushy professionally and financially. I applied to move abroad (from a developing to a developed country) in early 2020. I was very hopeful and looking forward to the move, but COVID happened and my application seen significant delays, with a final approval coming through only late last year. As with most of us, the pandemic warped my sense of time and motivation to a point where this big move took a complete backseat in my mind and life went on as usual. \n\nBut last year, I decided was lucky to visit the country for a few weeks - I explored a bit, met friends, got a basic feel of the place and returned home. Since then, I haven't been able to get it out of my mind. I almost feel like the impending move is hanging over my head and I have to take a decision soon, which brings me to my question - should I move, is the risk worth it in my early 30s? \n\nHere's my list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n- A new experience. Although I have traveled a fair bit, I have never really lived away from home. \n- Independence and freedom. I'm super independent, love spending time by myself, learning new things, meeting people, and I think my heart is yearning for a change. \n- Mobility and travel. I get the chance to see a new part of the world. \n- Timing. I have no real commitments holding me back (in terms of a relationship, debt, kids, etc.). Work is okay, but I have been feeling very disengaged and bored/burned out lately. Not sure what the next few months or years will look like if I prolong the decision, it's now or never.  \n- Stepping out of my comfort zone. I've never done anything this big by myself. My gut is saying go, but my mind keeps pulling me back. And every time I think I’ve arrived at a decision I freak out. \n\nCons: \n- I'd have to leave behind family, and I worry about my ageing parents (in their 60s, no major health issues), although I do have a sibling to care for them in my absence. \n- I won't have a job when I land, but I have been networking a fair bit and I'm hoping that I'll be able to land something in a few months of arrival. \n- Is this too late for me to do something like this? Everyone I know is partnered or married. My fear is wasting time, money, effort just in the name of exploring a new opportunity, when I could stay back build off my current situation (which I am overall happy about), maybe invest in finding a partner too (the pressure to be married is on :/).  \n- I've never done anything like this before, and I'd be leaving behind any kind of stability I have built so far. \n\nThere is a big part of me that wants to just go for it, but I am also so scared and fearful because it will absolutely be a giant leap of faith. \nHELP!",

My mom’s family is pretty large but they all live in France. My dad’s family is very small - only 2 cousins around my age and I don’t speak to either of them. \n\nI started thinking about life in general on my drive home last night lol and just started thinking about what I’m going to do when I’m older, once my parents pass and I’m in retirement age. If my boyfriend dies before me, I will be 100% completely alone and I started freaking out. I make a decent amount of money, but from bad financial decisions in my 20s I’m still paying off debt from that. So I don’t really have much to save. I only contribute 3% to my 401K and have only been contributing for the last 2 years (past jobs didn’t have a 401K or I’ve job hopped before the 401k starts since you have to be there for a year). So I feel like I won’t have any money for retirement. I don’t typically think in the future and just think about now and live in the moment, so thinking about all of this kind of made me freak out. It’s just kind of a kick in the pants to realize one day I’ll be totally alone with no family, no kids, and no partner. And may not be able to afford senior living if I need it.",

There’s rare occasions where we argue and it’s like arguing with a toddler because he doesn’t really know how to communicate his feelings but he’s gotten a lot better over the years and has actively tried getting better. \n\nThe problem is, I have never been in a healthy relationship until this one. I’ve been in extremely toxic relationships and I’m used to the rollercoaster up and downs, and the chaos of relationships. I also suspect I may have BPD or ADHD which may also have an effect on what my problems is as well. But because of the past toxic relationships, I sometimes get “bored” with my current partner. I know it’s all in my head and it’s only because of how tumultuous my past relationships have been and it’s what I’m “used to”. It also seems to happen after w shave an argument, almost like “I’d rather deal with someone who doesn’t argue” which obviously does not exist. \n\nRight now I find myself in a phase of being “bored” and being annoyed with him simply for existing. We don’t spend much time together. He works at a bar and I work a regular corporate 9-5 job. We typically only have Wednesday nights, Saturday mornings, and Sunday all day together. How can I get over this? I thought about maybe going out on actual dates again. We don’t do this anymore. To spend real time outside of our house together. Are there any other suggestions that may help?\n\nPlease don’t tell me to dump him. The main issue is with me and the way my brain works from past trauma. I do love him a lot and I want this to work. I don’t currently have a therapist because of funds, but I know that would help me as well. Mainly just wanting to know if anybody has gotten themselves out of a “rut” and what you did to help get out of it.",

I want to just do my job during work hours and that’s it. \n\nHow do you change that mindset and just do what’s expected?\n\nOn the flip side, work has been extra hard lately with a new boss who doesn’t understand what it takes to do my job so expectations are now unrealistic. I just don’t know how to switch off and stop caring/taking things personally. \n\nI don’t want to get a new job.

The pay is a significant jump, over 30% jump in base and close to 40% jump after factoring in bonus.\n\nThis raise will make a significant financial impact to our household. Having said that, my husband and I make enough money currently to support our modest lifestyle. This bump will make our life even more affordable and we will save more money.\n\nThis role is similar to what I do now, but the title is a step up, and it’s for a larger company with apparently not as developed systems and processes. My current role has its share of overtime, and I expect this new role to have the same if not more.\n\nMy current company is in decline, and this company is growing.\n\nBased on what I can tell from the offer and negotiations, this new company seems quite inflexible (basically I couldn’t negotiate anything), and doesn’t care much about employee rights and benefits (no parental leave benefits, poor sick leave policy, kinda blah extended health and dental, blah vacation days, poor severance terms for employee with no cause).\n\nThis is the thing that gives me the most pause. Their employee benefits and rights are blah even compared to some smaller companies I’ve been with. I was quite surprised.\n\nI am the mother of a one year old, and in recent years have had some health issues that we’re still trying to figure out. The fact that they have the minimum number of sick leave as mandated by law just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Their vacation days are over a week less than what my current employer gives me.\n\nThe salary increase of course more than covers the difference in benefits, but the fact that they seem deliberately stubborn in keeping mediocre benefits sends a message that they don’t want new parents and that they don’t care about the well-being of its employees. It feels like they wouldn’t hesitate to get rid of me if I get sick or if my child needs me too often.\n\nIt is a good step up though and I can always use this as a springboard in a couple of years to another role with better benefits.\n\nThe other consideration is starting a new challenging job right after my mat leave. Will it be too much for me?\n\nWould appreciate your thoughts, WWYD?",

I hate my mom and dad (no longer there), they fucked me up so badly which is why I am bouncing from one unavailable partner to another.\n\nMy mom constantly told me I was ugly growing up and that's what I believed for so many years which is why i couldn't  attract a BF. After dealing with my dad's death and having all the family responsibilities fall on me , I am really just focusing on myself. I started to date very late and I am learning everything late, all the lessons, all the know how's everything; if I try explaining to my mom she obviously never understands anything. I just feel no matter what age, I just can't live the life I want and everything is controlled. I actually never want to go back there, I was visiting after 4 years and that's all people cared about - \"when I am getting married\". \n\nThis is a post triggered by my mom's phone call. You might say she means well and is coming from a good place, but fuck it! I honestly don't know what to do sitting here and I came in here to vent. \n\n\nPlz be kind. End of rant",

It was obvious he was hitting on me and whenever he'd get flirty I'd move the conversation back to whatever topic we were going on about but I guess that was too subtle or he just didn't care.  \n\nMy friends would pop in and out to join the discussion and at one point I got up to go pee and the MFer pulled the tie to my bikini bottoms.  I'd been drinking a fair amount so I was just kind of flabbergasted and just muttered don't do that or something.  \n\nWhen I got back I tried to steer clear of him and just join my friends but of course hes right back there next to me.  Eventually one of his other friends come over and we get talking and I'm relieved because the first guy eventually ambles away but then I'm stuck with the other guy.  We talk for a bit and this one starts putting his arm around me and touching my butt, I shrug him off and then he grabs my phone and puts his number in it.  He's saying all this lovebomb crap like \"where did you come from\", \"i really want to kiss you right now\" and \"how amazing I am\". Gag me.  \n\nMeanwhile, I'm just moving as far over from him as i can without falling off the bar benches and saying \"uh thanks, I'm good\". Finally one of my friends recognized me giving her the death stare and came to rescue me to go get ready for dinner, thank god. \n\n30 minutes later comes this barrage of texts from pool dude telling me he loves me and I should come out to party. Yeah, hard pass. He keeps texting and I finally delete his number.  Just as we're getting ready to go to dinner there's a knock at our hotel door.  I don't know if he followed us to see what room we were in or what but there he was with his bikini string pulling asshat friend. \n\nThis crap freaked out my friends and I so badly.  \n\nI feel so annoyed with myself for not being more assertive but when guys are aggressively hitting on me I freeze up so badly and it's just a deer in headlights thing. What would you have done or does anyone else have this problem? \n\nIf someone else is being pursued by aggressive guys I have zero problem sticking up for them but when it's me I turn into some little meek damsel in distress which is the opposite of my personality generally. It's quite annoying.",

I thought this would be in my 20s, but life circumstances and the passage of time have me now in my 30s still hopeful and learning more about it. The more I read, though, the more worried and scared I feel about the physical impact of pregnancy. I’ve read so many stories of women losing teeth, bodily function, developing debilitating illness or injury during and after pregnancy, and even death. I know it’s an enormously tolling and incredible thing for women to do, but is it really as dangerous as I keep hearing? Especially being in my 30s now (and considered “geriatric” ugh! That’s a whole other thing) it makes me wonder and even worry what might happen. I don’t have too many women with children in my life as examples, so my source is largely the internet. I’m also unusually petite, so I know that could put me at additional risk as well as being older. Does anyone have any more insight into this? I’m trying not to feel too scared!",

Around this time i also was trying some different therapy modalities (virtually) that clearly brought up even more for me.  \n\nFor 6 weeks in 2021 i blocked everyone from my phone and went no contact.  I only did it out of self preservation bc i was dealing with so much and interacting with others was making everything so much harder for me.  While i wish i could have instead given everyone a heads up on what was going on, i truly felt so shut down that i couldn’t.\n\nAs hard as it was, i pulled myself out and then had to begin an apology tour.  I emailed back and forth with 1 of my close friends and we set up a time for a phone call.  That call went well and i apologized/explained everything. She seemed understanding and like we could move forward.  Over coming weeks i asked about having another call or getting together and she said she hadnt shared everything on our original call but wanted to when she felt ready.  I understood and gave her space. We texted a bit and then she went silent.  I havent heard from her in 1.5 years.\n\nI haven’t tried pursuing things further bc i already did a lot of apologizing and i was waiting for her to be ready to talk.  I’m just so hurt by this friendship loss.\n\nI know that closure is on me to figure out, but i’m still having trouble reconciling her not wanting to be friends anymore.",

We both are very different but our thinking towards things is quite similar. We both grew up in chaotic household in different ways. I am independent woman. I do not have big expectations from my SO. Being considerate, respect and funny are qualities which I look for and he has all of them. I have confessed few times that I really like him. But he suffers from anxiety and disappears for few days. I was in that phase when I used to hide from any kind of interactions with anyone. So I understand his situation. He us also grateful that I am able to understand his traumas. He is not expressive like me. Most of the times I need to figure out through his actions what he exactly means. He is not much vocal or expressive person. Now, its been 6 months, I have been understanding towards his behaviour. And I would love to continue doing that. But, as a independent woman I would like some commitment to feel bit secure. Please advice if I should force him to have the commitment talk or just give him more time?\n\nHe has explained about the reasons behind his anxiety. I don’t like to force people into knowing their stories. I would rather create safe environment for them where they will feel like sharing. I have been doing the same for him. Unfortunately, as a normal person I am afraid of future too, and I would love to spend it with him. Whenever he is having such episodes of hiding completely from world I be patient. Wait for him to be normal. He takes good 1 2 weeks to get back to normal and it has happened twice till now. Within that period I get scared of where it is going and what’s happening.",

        "text": "I used to have what seemed like a good job. The pay was ok, could probably stay there for life although I was very bored and wasn't happy with the projects they gave me. But we all know that wisdom in tech around moving jobs every 2 years to maximise your salary, and sharpening skills, so I moved to a new place with a huge salary increase and glittering tech.\n\nI ended up dealing with a hostile workplace where I felt physically unsafe, and management did nothing and I couldn't just walk out because I was living in a HCOL city where I needed money, so I stayed longer than I wanted to, and I was so anxious and stressed I couldn't put myself through job interviews.\n\nIn the end I decided to leave the city entirely and take time off to recover (it did a number on me). I did so and retrained in some new skills and decided to set up my own business, and the pandemic came along and destroyed that project, so I ended up unemployed much longer than I ever planned. \n\nThen I got a new job and very soon on knew it was a terrible choice and very bad fit but we were put immediately back into confinement so I stayed for stability reasons.\n\nAfter the first year of getting stable I felt like I couldn't leave and go elsewhere because the job was so chaotic that I couldn't really talk about it in job interviews. So I stayed one year further just to try and focus on getting certain projects for my CV I could talk about in job interviews to get out of there. \n\nHere I am interviewing for new jobs and I hope the next is going to be a good one.\n\nIt seems like for the last 4-5 years my career and life has focused around getting out of certain situations rather than going towards any particular destination. I therefore feel like I have very little control over my life because I'm not making strides and moving forward, I'm fighting fires and trying to adapt and cope with the results.\n\nI feel squeezed by the rising living costs, the energy crisis, the fact that the workplace has completely control over us for 40 hours a week and we need to put up with it in order to live and the workplace can lie to you, fuck up your career plans, and force you to work with dangerous people.\n\nI just feel like nothing really matters, none of my accomplishments or my skills or my motivation, because at the end of the day I can't make the choice to progress in my career, I just have to hope that my manager provides a safe workplace and that there's no global pandemic around the corner and no rent crisis to force me into feelings of fear. The luck of the draw.\n\nI know I have control over my life objectively speaking, but the mental toll of certain life events can really knock the wind out of your sails and make you function at lower capacity. So yes I have control but no I could not implement any actions to get me out of where I am over the last few years due to events stacking up one after the other and having to play things safe.\n\nAnd, for privacy reasons, I didn't even mention how many things went wrong in my personal life at the same time. I would say 3-4 giant explosions happened over this time that gutted me. So I had that to recover from too.\n\nI wish I could go back to that time where I was in that boring job where I wasn't happy, because at least there was stability back then, and it wasn't the worst job in the world. It was the last time where I genuinely felt like I was aiming and shooting for things, instead of running for cover while being shot at by one disaster after another.\n\ntl;dr Made a decision years ago that has resulted in me having no life goals since, as my energy has been invested in working to get out of every negative situation that followed, and focused on attempting to avoid repeats of past situations, rather than invested in and focused on bright future possibilities. No more optimism, am I alone?",

        "text": "I’m 34 (f) and I just got out of a 5 year relationship in July.  I thought after the breakup I would be single for a while - but then I met someone amazing way sooner than I expected. We have been together since September of last year. Obviously we are still getting to know each others quirks, but we are in love and I really see a future with him. He treats me so well, we have fun together, our friends and families all get along really well, and everything feels happy and easy. He gives me the love, appreciation, and  respect that I never had with my ex. \n\nI’m finding that my idea of how a new relationship should progress is so warped, partially because it’s been so long since I was in a new relationship and also because in my previous relationship I was expecting to be engaged and married soon, so it feels weird to rewind back to early relationship steps. It doesn’t help that my biological clock is ticking SO LOUD at 34. I want to have kids, I’m looking into freezing my eggs right now, but I know that’s not a guaranteed thing. \n\nObviously there is no “right answer” - but I’d love to know what other people think about what would be a good timeline for moving in together, engagement, etc. assuming things continue to go well between us. He says that he is ready to move at whatever pace I am comfortable with.",

I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders - and I’m disinterested in life, work and my social life. \n\nWhat do you do when you feel like this? What do you do to help yourself feel better? \n\nI feel so lost at the moment.",
