I'm with a long term partner (6 years), so we've seen our drives come and go, but I personally have never felt so little sexual desire in my life, to an extent that even masterbation isn't as enjoyable. Ive tried fantasizing, watching porn, and I sometimes have sexy dreams so in my head Im definitely thinking about it a lot, when I wake up, my body just isn't feeling it. \n\nMy bf who has been very understanding has been very open to exploring options, like toys or even possibly doing a threesome or giving me a \"pass\" to hook up with someone else, but I'm just really not feeling it. I'm just not feeling sexy, and regardless of how I actually look, I just feel like I'm \"old\" and tired, and I just feel like 31 isn't nearly as \"old enough\" to feel biological changes like this.\n\nAs context, I just recently recovered from a year long major depression where I literally used to have self harm thoughts, and I've also quit my job as a result running between temporary jobs. I'm guessing this is affecting my libido but also I've had moments during my depression that I was more hobby than I am now (FYI I'm not taking any antidepressants, I did psilocybin therapy).\n\nHas anybody had a similar experience? If yes, how did you get back on track?",

        "text": "For a couple of years, he came in and out of my life, unexpectedly. Not rude or anything, but a slow fade. I'd get the hint and then forget about him. Eventually, the lack of accountability left me feeling used so I told him. The behavior continued and I finally blocked him (and other relationships without accountability) during the pandemic to clear my head and begin a 2-year journey of radical self-love.\n\nI wanted a better life and more real, substantial relationships.\n\nFast forward to 6 months ago, I unblocked him b/c I felt that he had been a good friend in other ways and it was worth giving it one more chance. For example, he has always supported my work and believed in me and we always have the BEST time together. Laughing til crying, always.\n\nAs soon as I unblocked him, he texted to see how I was. He began asking me to go to galleries, and see music. We have seen each other 3 times over the past 6 months. In between, he'd send me friendly postcards from his travels abroad (twice). FYI, we are both single and there is something there, but it was really important to me to build a friendship and put that aside b/c friendship is something I am really hungering for right now.\n\nThe last time we saw each other was two weeks ago and I'd invited him out for great music. I'd wanted to make an effort b/c he seemed so keen on our friendship and I wanted to build a real friendship. I asked him out via text: I'm going \\_\\_\\_\\_ Friday night, join me. He said yes and the day before our plans he asked what time I'd get there and I said 10pm. Friday rolls around and I text him at 9pm that I'll be leaving soon. Nothing. I text him at 9:30pm that I'm leaving and I'll be there around 10:15pm. Nothing. I text him 10:30pm that I think he fell asleep and oh well. He has never stood me. up.\n\nHe calls me after my last text (10:30pm) to tell me that he just got off a business call and that he has to shower and eat and he will be there soon. Told him he didn't have to come, I'm good. He arrived around 11:30pm. When we saw each other, I didn't want to fight b/c this was my night so I didn't say anything after he moaned about what a monumental effort he'd made in coming out!!!!!!!!!!T\n\nThe next day, I call him and told him that I simply asked him to come out and listen to good music but then, all this other nonsense appeared. I had to wonder where he was and what happened. I told him I didn't need to do that and should have gone by myself.\n\nHe interrupts me to tell me that he thought the invite was open and that I invited a lot of people. I responded that I am not arguing with him and that I invited him out, he said yes and we agreed on a time and that was that. I reminded him that I wasn't upset he was late, but that he didn't respond to my texts. I reminded him of our issues in the past and that perhaps we aren't supposed to be friends and that I'm not taking this personally.\n\nI really needed to get off the phone b/c I could feel I was starting to get emotional so I told him that I have to go make a salad and watch The Shining. Right as I was hanging up he says my name and then says, I LOVE YOU.\n\nI had a big business project happening the upcoming week and didn't want to get more invested in this dynamic so I blocked him for a week until the project ended. I unblocked him about a week ago, and haven't heard from him other than an Insta post he shared that I didn't reply to. There is a dangling I LOVE YOU.\n\nIt just seems so out of character for him b/c he only ever would just fade the calls and invites, he never stood me up or bailed on plans.\n\nDo I need to really accept that he doesn't value my friendship and move on? Makes me so sad.",

I understand if you don't have the energy for it and just scroll past.\n\nHusband (H) and I, both early 30s, have been together for over 10 years. No kids nor plans for any, but we do co-own animals and property and have a mortgage and loans together. We both work and could support ourselves financially independently if we had too. We share life goals, values, a sense of humor, taste in music and TV shows we like to enjoy together, and much more. I love him deeply and absolutely adore our life together...when things are good. You see where this is going.\n\nHe is chronically severely depressed and anxious and has a tendency to frequently (nearly once a month, usually lasts between 6 hours to 3 days ish) have these episodes where he's so depressed and has such low self esteem that he wants to quit everything. His job, his friendships, everything except for me. He has never self harmed or harmed anyone else and I don't have any immediate fear that he would, but when he is in these states, it's scary. He is so, so serious about turning his life upside down. And sometimes he does parts of it. He once (long ago) quit his job with no backup plan during a depressive episode. He has cut off friendships, cancelled trips last minute, and more. He just gets in this place where he feels utterly hopeless about ever being anything but miserable and is sick of putting so much effort into living and still feeling like shit. He feels like he lacks the ability to make or maintain relationships of any sort and that it is way more work than it is worth. He's burned out.\n\nYes, he's in therapy. Yes, he's tried different therapists. Yes, he's on medication. Yes, he's tried different medications.\n\nI am the rock. I am the only person he truly opens up to and feels comfortable going to for support when he is feeling this bad. I love him so much and it is so hard to see him hurting like this. I want to help him feel better. I have tried everything over the years to support him. But I'm starting to feel hopeless too. I feel so guilty feeling this way because for however bad it is for me, it's so many times worse for him, but I don't know if I can do this anymore. When he isn't having one of those episodes, he's frequently cold, short with me, and generally negative, passive aggressive, and resentful. This behavior can quickly and easily spiral into one of those episodes. He never yells, I have never feared for my safety, but it still sucks. I feel like we get maybe one or two good days a month together where I feel happy with him and loved. The rest of the time it's just fleeting moments in between him slamming doors, hiding in his office, snippy \"I'm fine\"s when he clearly isn't.\n\nSome of it is genuine things I could do better. I'm not a saint. A big one is I am chronically late and terrible at communicating about it, and it makes him feel like I feel his time is less valuable than mine and he feels disrespected. I own that and need to do better, and am trying. But a lot of his negativity is triggered by his mental health, and it makes it harder to work through our other issues like this one.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I am literally getting triggered by the smallest shows of negativity on his part. Yesterday he slammed his laptop closed and stormed out of the room when I took a work call that delayed our weekend plans (it was shitty, I acknowledge that. His feelings are valid, his reaction...meh). I jumped and my heartrate shot through the roof and I could not calm down. I feel like I am walking on eggshells and at any moment I am terrified that something will cause him to spiral into one of those terrible episodes. I cannot handle this nor the constant negativity. But it also isn't fair for him to not be allowed to express his negative emotions in the safety of his own home.\n\nI suggested we sell our home and live separately, near each other but having our own spaces. That way we can  be intentional about spending time, but be able to fully express ourselves and relax at home without fear of triggering the other. I suggested we still spend the same amount of intentional time together we do now; we have weekly date nights and usually hang out together 2 or 3 additional evenings a week or a weekend day or something. I would come sleep over at his place sometimes. He said he would not feel as if we are married if we did that and we may as well get divorced, which neither of us wants.\n\nI feel like I am blowing up my relationship and I feel like I am losing all sense of what is reasonable. I feel sometimes like my expectations for him are unreasonable or I am letting him down as a partner. What do you think?",

        "text": "I started this job around 8mos ago and met a coworker, Tiffany, who, at the time, I thought was one of the first nice people at the office. She was always friendly with me but never really brought me in to her circle. This all changed when a couple new girls joined the team. I began befriending them but suddenly Tiffany decided to bring me into her group and soon I was wrapped into a whirlwind of drama and gossip. I‚Äôm a float, so I‚Äôm not always in the same part of the building every day, but days with Tiffany quickly changed from what I thought might be fostering a budding new friendship circle to being confronted with shit talking everything the new people did as if they were a literal scourge on the office. I was basically told this again and again only to later find out it was almost completely frabricated. As I was around Tiffany more, it seemed no one, not even her most prized companions, were safe from her incessant negative talk of which I knew I was mostly a topic of whenever I wasn‚Äôt around. Especially since whenever I would say anything out of the norm for Tiffany there would be shady comments and significant glances. Enough so I knew I wasn‚Äôt in a safe environment to share certain things about myself, like my queerness. \n\nPretty soon, I was becoming extremely neurotic to the point I wanted to quit the job because not only was I barraged with drama day in and day out, I felt trapped in that I had to be an active listener/in vague agreement or else I was ‚Äúpunished‚Äù in weird psychological/passive aggressive ways like suddenly being pushed out of conversations or everyone walking past with smiles and waves saying they‚Äôre going to a lunch I wasn‚Äôt invited to or things on my desk being removed and other stuff I won‚Äôt go into too much detail about. I couldn‚Äôt even sit by myself at my desk during free moments. If I wasn‚Äôt engaged with Tiffany‚Äôs drama and gossip AND listening to her bemoan every aspect of her life whenever I was around her, I was ‚Äúpunished‚Äù. One time she made a loud proclamation for no one to bother me (Read: talk to me) anymore that day because I dared to tell her I was going to go read a book during my break. Suffice to say, I found out that the person who seemed the nicest in the office was actually one of the most manipulative, vindictive, and narcissistic people I‚Äôve met to a scary degree. I‚Äôve never met a REAL person who can so convincingly smile in people‚Äôs face while doing things that seem very nice (like gift giving) then turn around and talk about them like they‚Äôre subhuman and actively attempt to vilify and ostracize them. When she announced she was leaving for another position, I almost cried in joy.\n\nThe reprieve without her burdening the office has been amazing as well as finding out subsequently that many (though not all) people didn‚Äôt want her around as she did nothing at the job but literally gossip all day to the point she was rarely at her desk. However, I expected that she would just fade away. She talks so much and says so many false things I took everything she said with a grain of salt you‚Äôd need a telescope to see. So I didn‚Äôt believe that she really had no other friends and was scared everyone she talked to from work would fade out of her life. But I guess it‚Äôs not hard to imagine most people go running from her as fast as they can when given the opportunity. \n\nNow she‚Äôs been hitting me up because she‚Äôs absolutely miserable and regrets leaving. I‚Äôve been able to get out of most of it because she‚Äôs been inviting me to things last minute or the day before. She‚Äôs become wise to this and is now asking to plan things in advanced. I don‚Äôt want this woman in my life anymore! I don‚Äôt even believe she actually wants to hang out with me, as in me as a person, but more wants a vessel to dump her toxicity on and to reassert control. She obsessively hit up another coworker who also wants nothing to do with her and only stopped once they responded and said all was fine. She just happens to want to see me in person likely because I‚Äôve been rejecting her. Normally, I would ignore someone like this since she‚Äôs gone. But she‚Äôs made a habit of coming to all our work functions over the holidays! I feel like I‚Äôm not going to be fully rid of this person until I leave the company and I‚Äôm not sure what I can do without some weird blow up from her that will likely be surreptitious and drama filled like everything else with her. I wish I could go into more detail about how terrible this grown ass Mean Girl is‚Äîthis situation actually pushed me back into therapy‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just interested what other women would do in this situation as it‚Äôs completely novel to me.",

        "text": "I (34F) sometimes hate being the best and oldest friend to a few of my friends. I know there was another post a few days ago about what are things women look for in a friendship and a lot of women said that they prefer friends who are low maintenance and can connect with them every few months or even years. It‚Äôs great that cadence and effort in friendship works for some women. However, for some of us who are single or divorced, we rely more on friendships for connection and emotional support. Also, I was married previously so I do understand how it feels to be wrapped up in married life but I always tried to prioritize my friendships and made time/space for them even if I was busy. \n\nCoincidentally, I‚Äôm the closest or oldest friend to 3 of my friends. They‚Äôve all moved on with their lives and one of them has kids as well. Ever since they‚Äôve gotten partnered up or had a family they really only prioritize their partner or kids. I‚Äôm fine with obviously them prioritizing those relationships but I‚Äôm a little sad about my friendship getting super deprioritized. I feel like because we have a long and extensive history, they feel they don‚Äôt need to invest energy into our friendship anymore. For example, my friends never have time to hang out with me but will have time to hang out with their partner‚Äôs friends or mom friends (mom nights out). They do call/text every couple of months to catch up. I‚Äôm happy we can catch up like we‚Äôve always done but I feel friendships (like any kind of relationship) needs effort to be maintained. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôm starting not to feel as comfortable in sharing things because I don‚Äôt feel as close to them (even with our history). Two of them didn‚Äôt really check in on me when I was going through a divorce but I was there for them every step of the way (almost on call) when they got married because I was their matron of honor. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure at this point if I should accept that this is the way friendships are in your 30s and beyond because it seems a lot of women feel that this is actually normal. I can‚Äôt help but feel sad and sometimes even neglected as their closest and oldest friend. Do other women feel this way or am I just being too sensitive?",

        "text": "There was( I think still is) this post about decentering men from our lives and I don't completely agree with it, so here's my opinion\n\nIt is perfectly natural to want to have a partner. May be because of society/nuclear family (of course), but it doesn't matter. Thing is, it's perfectly okay to desire to be with someone whom you can share your life with. \n\nIt's also absolutely okai and natural to vent about your experiences/to feel sad at times and dissappointed. But where I draw the line is at being absolutely miserable because you don't have a partner. \n\nI always listen to my friends who vent about this and relationships are often discussed (the most discussed topic tbh), but I often seem to notice that some people (women, in my case) just don't want to talk about anything else, really.\n\nFor example, every time I meet up with a friend of mine, all she talks about is men and how she doesn't see the point in her life without one. I listened and keep listening to her, I suggested she talked to a therapist. I have always been there for her, but when she calls/messages or when we see each other, it's the only thing she talks about. \nAm I wrong to feel drained? \nAm I wrong to think that even if someone wants a partner, which again, is perfectly normal and okai, maybe at times it would help to focus on other things?\nAgain, I always listen and will continue to do so and I think that not being Happy single is absolutely normal, but I also believe that being completely miserable because of this is maybe not the way to go.\n\n\nTd;lr: My opinion on decentering men from our lives/being unhappy while single",

        "text": "I (39f) have been seeing a guy (35m) for the past year or so. We live in different countries and we are not exclusive. We enjoy each others‚Äô company, are attracted to one another, and have become good and supportive friends during this time. I guess it could be somewhat described as a bit of a situationship/friends-with-benefits, but we had both agreed we didn‚Äôt want a relationship and honestly it had been working for us pretty well due to our respective life circumstances. We‚Äôve only met up a handful of times in person, but are in regular contact.\n\nI found out a couple months ago he is ‚Äúdear friends‚Äù with a woman online that expresses some of the worst forms of internalised misogyny I have ever seen. On her ***very public*** social media accounts she calls all women bitches/c\\*nts, says things like she is glad she never had sisters, calls women ugly, drama queens, says they all hate her because they‚Äôre jealous etc. She is also ageist and fatphobic. She laments that she has no true friends in real life, only online friends (who are all men and who she flirts with incessantly), that nobody understands her, that she is doomed to be alone forever etc. These are all interspersed with criticisms about everybody in her life, how everybody has done her wrong etc. I was shocked to find out she‚Äôs 38 and still holds these views. She is clearly deeply unhappy.\n\nBut I am so bothered by this. I have questioned whether I am ‚Äújealous‚Äù because she is categorically beautiful, but so are many of his other female friends and I am not bothered by that at all. I am not a jealous person, we are not exclusive, and I generally practice ethical non-monogamy. But he is so defensive of her and calls her a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù, even though he admits that he cannot excuse the things she says.\n\nI am struggling with this, and I could do with some help identifying why. It has already made me end our sexual relationship as I guess it gave me the ‚Äúick‚Äù, but it seems to also be threatening any future friendship we had hoped to have. I care deeply for this man ‚Äì he is kind and compassionate and patient, but his unwillingness to stand up to her and his continuance to promote her work doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. It feels to me like he is conflating her ability to make him feel good (she very much panders to him and strokes his ego) with her being a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù and I guess that has made me question his integrity?\n\nAm I being unfair? Is my reaction to this another form of internalised misogyny? I am willing to face some hard truths.\n\nThank you for reading.",

        "text": "I know, relationships (of all kinds) are very important for all of us, but if men are the main focus of your life,  to the point that you feel worthless without their attention, there is a deeper problem that nobody can solve but you.\n\nIf you keep waiting for a man to save you, you will be ultimately miserable. You will waste your precious years in a \"waiting mode\" instead of focusing on your own flourishing, you will be depending on someone else's validation instead of being your own true self. De-center men from your life, look for yourself and what makes you happy, cultivate your passions, seek what inspires you the most, do not waste energy on trying to figure out why he's pulling away, why he's breadcrumbing, how \"bad\" it will be to be single, etc. Don't let the shitty expectations of society to conform to the norms that demonize single people decide for your life, for example letting yourself tolerating shitty behaviors or emotional breadcrumbing just to avoid being single.\n\nTo be clear it's not a personal attack against the women who have posted this stuff, I used to put men at the center of my life a too and it was a massive waste of energy and time. I just wish women could develop their full potential and flourishing instead of chasing delusional codependent romantic fantasies. We already have centuries of wasted women happiness and talent, let's please try to take advantage of the little progress we have made so far and push forward. The next step is emancipating ourselves psychologically from meb - we are formally equal, but we are still psychologically very subordinated to men. And the thing is, this not only happens because of sexism, misogyny, discrimination and gender violence, but also because we do not emancipate ourselves from these toxic narratives that tell us we are worthless without a man's validation.\n\nBtw In no way I'm saying that relationships don't matter nor I want to invalidate the need for human connection and emotional bonds.\n\nPS: guess what, r/askmenover30 has zero posts about women.",

She‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs deeply involved in the spiritual way of living (think chakras, meditation, astrology type spiritually) and expressed to me that in her spiritual journey she felt that she was called upon to be a ‚Äúmentor‚Äù of sorts to men in the area of sex. \n\nFine by me, I think most men could benefit from having communicative and honest sexual partner. She disclosed to me that she has taken on multiple lovers under the agreement that she‚Äôll guide them to be better lovers and then ‚Äúrelease‚Äù them into the dating sphere to put the knowledge that gained from her to use with other lovers.\n\nAlso fine. She then mentioned that these lovers were 18 and 19 and alarm bells rang for me. I expressed to my boyfriend that weirded out by the age of her lovers and he didn‚Äôt seem to think it was that big of a deal. He asked me what I felt like an appropriate age for her lovers would be and I said 27, i couldn‚Äôt really explain why I said that number it just felt right to me.\n\n\nI asked a few of my girlfriends how they felt about the age gap and the resounding response I got was ‚ÄúWell if men can do it why can‚Äôt women?‚Äù \n\nI guess what I‚Äôm asking is, am I some heinous prude for being a little cautious about this information? How do you guys feel about large age gaps when it comes to dating, specifically where the woman is far older that the man?",

        "text": "I am not necessarily looking for advice and I know no one can ‚Äúmind read‚Äù what happened here but I just was hoping more so to maybe just have others to relate with. I am recently married and I naively thought that once I was married, I wouldn‚Äôt end up in as many uncomfy situations with men. But it seems like that‚Äôs not true, it‚Äôs just different now. Men still don‚Äôt give me the respect or human decency they should. \n\nSo, me (30F) and my husband (37M) and a close friend of mine who I‚Äôll call Lana (36F) formed a bowling team (not really bowling but for privacy) and we each invited a friend or two. Lana invited her friend Dan (38M) and Dan and I seemed to get along right off the bat as we immediately had some common interests that happened to come up in conversation. We seemed to have formed a fast friendship between all four of us. \n\nAfter our bowling team ended, dan was still a very new friend to us, but he seemed very excited to have us as friends. We all four ended up going to coffee together, out for new years, things like that. I would note Dan and Lana have been friends for years, so she‚Äôs not new to him, just me and my husband. \n\nI started to have a slight inkling that Dan was purposely ignoring me or kind of diminishing me when we were out as a group, but I shook that off as just me being insecure. Because why would he keep inviting me and my husband out if he didn‚Äôt like me? Even if he did like my husband, that would be weird. I know couples where I don‚Äôt like one so I don‚Äôt hangout with either. Plus I am generally very easy to get along with and didn‚Äôt sense that he and I were incompatible personalities until he started treating me weirdly. \n\nAnyways so again, Dan invited the three of us to a game night at his house. He has fancy food for us and bought a new game to play, and we brought wine. \n\nWe get there and it‚Äôs obvious to me that he‚Äôs like ignoring me or being kind of cold/rude to me, and not my husband or friend. It‚Äôs hard to explain how. The last straw and most blatant example was he asked Lana and my husband if they wanted him to make them a latte, they said yes, he makes them one, then just doesn‚Äôt offer to make me one. Pretends I don‚Äôt exist. \n\nThis night just hurts my feelings and pisses me off. And it‚Äôs confusing, because why the fuck is he inviting us over if he doesn‚Äôt like me? I‚Äôm thinking like, is he closeted and has a crush on my husband? He doesn‚Äôt seem gay to me.",

        "text": "As the title says, I am in a fork in the road of my life. The theme of these decisions reminded me of what the suits represent in a tarot deck, if you enjoy that sort of thing. The two paths are:\n\n*Life of Spiritual Fulfillment and Dreams in Oceantown (Suits of Cups and Wands)*\n\nI am living a good four hour plane ride away from my family, my family that I am very close to but have spent the last 15 years away from because I chose my partner over them, to be frank. I was also in my twenties, being adventurous, living overseas, etc...so I am trying to not guilt trip myself for having spent so much time away. Now that my partner and I are no longer together, I want to make more time to spend time with my family, especially my parents and one of my siblings that I am very close to.\n\nI have always wanted, since I was very young, as young as middle school, to live on the coast, and in particular this one little town. Let's call it Oceantown. It's close to my family (within 1-2 hour driving distance, and one of my siblings lives there already), has decent job prospects for me, and has the lifestyle I have always dreamed of. I am a marine scientist, so you can imagine that I have always wanted to live on the ocean. Oceantown is also very walkable, something else I've always dreamed of - very rarely having to get in my car most days to live my life. I could walk to the beach with my dogs, walk to the grocery store, walk to shops and cafes, walk or bike to work, and only have to get in my car to get out of town or go surfing. (I don't not like driving, I just literally feel more grounded when I avoid driving as much as possible). I love stormy weather and Oceantown is known for their dramatic, moody storms. I visited recently, and the idea of all of this being within reach excited me. It's a place that fills my cup spiritually. I lived in a town near Oceantown for a summer a few years ago and loved it, so I know that I have a good sense of what it would really be like to *live* there, and not just visit.\n\n*Life of a Known Community and Stability (Suit of Cups and Pentacles)*\n\nI currently live in a town that I like for other reasons, but pretty important reasons. I have built a great community of friends. Friends that supported each other through the pandemic, friends that helped me move all of my stuff out when I got divorced, friends that have a lot of fun together. \n\nI also have a great job - I work with people that are my friends, and so there is very little workplace drama. Sometimes going to my office feels like an extension of my own home. My job pays decently and I have an incredible amount of autonomy and flexibility. There are also parts of the lifestyle of this town that I do really like and would miss if I moved away.\n\nOne thing to note is that I only recently took my current job (just over a year ago) and so making a decision to move feels too soon to move on from a job, let alone a leaving a job where I work with a lot of friends.\n\n*Should I Stay or Should I Go? (Suit of Swords)*\n\nIt feels a little silly to have this dilemma. I understand that this is a very fortunate dilemma to have. I'm just curious if anyone has advice that would help me make a decision. Writing this out actually helps me clarify things to myself a bit, but I'm curious what other people's thoughts/experiences are.",

Ideally I would be able to set a time limit to do something and actually, you know, do it. I‚Äôll give some examples.\n\nI work a desk job that involves writing and editing. I get soooo easily distracted by the internet/my phone. I would like to be able to summon the discipline to just sit and work, but I get restless. I often put my phone in another room (when I work from home) or leave it in the car for a while (while at the office), but my attention is still inconsistent. I‚Äôll get up and walk around or find something else to do. That being said, I still meet all my deadlines and get things done on time. I can focus when I need to, but that tends to happen with the pressure of an impending deadline. I would like to be able to be ahead of the game without the pressure of a deadline.\n\nI‚Äôm the same way with cleaning and keeping up with chores around the house. I procrastinate like crazy, and the only thing that really motivates me is when I‚Äôm going to have visitors. I don‚Äôt live in squalor or anything but I would just like to have a cleaner, more presentable house. Also, there are a lot of home projects and repairs that I need to do and I‚Äôve been dragging my feet to do them. On the weekends when I have downtime I just end up scrolling or finding some other distraction. \n\nI‚Äôve tried time blocking and it doesn‚Äôt work for me. I can write down in my schedule ‚Äúclean from 1-2‚Äù but I just‚Ä¶wont do it.\n\nI‚Äôve tried the pomodoro technique and it works slightly better than time blocking but not by that much.\n\nI‚Äôve wondered if maybe I have ADHD but I dunno. I‚Äôm a very type B, laid back person and I don‚Äôt feel urgency for very many things without outside pressure. I feel like my trouble with focus is very much tied to so much screen time and getting instant gratification from that.\n\nThe bottom line is that I eventually get things done but I‚Äôd really like to be more on top of my life and not so distracted/lazy/procrastinating.

        "text": "In a nutshell, I work in a small, remote company environment. It feels like the marketing department steamrolls me anytime I give some pushback. \n\nOn paper or in a brief summary it looks like their asks and reasoning is reasonable but from my side, looking at the whole picture I am left feeling gaslit and unsupported.\n\nThe most recent interaction went like this, my tiny team finally got the greenlight to proceed with hiring an agency to improve our customer portal. It is costly but with the target customers being our bread and butter, along with plans to grow the company without expanding my team this is extremely important.\n\n2 weeks ago, the marketing team was looped in. The immediate pushback was wondering how the duties they oversee would be affected. Totally fair, I had approached it only from the CS point of view, so a meeting was set with the agency so they could ask these questions. \n\nThe day before the meeting near EOD I am bombarded with questions about the data of customer complaints. Picking into why this update was happening. A request was made for that data. Which was fine but with an extremely tight turnaround I wouldn't have it ready till an hour or so before the meeting with the agency the following day. \n\nThen I'm told they want to postpone this meeting that had been set up for them because they don't know the questions they would have without this data, which left me feeling like it was now my fault they were not prepared. \n\nI ended my workday with that meeting that was set up for them rain checked. I was under the impression they would have new questions for the agency. This was an introductory meeting so they could ask questions and wrap their head around the scope. \n\nI feel discouraged. I want to feel like part of the team, the way things went down felt adversarial and pretty awful to be honest. \n\nI have rolled with the punches that have come from their team, I'm flexible but when I give pushback it feels like I'm ganged up on and disregarded like I don't know what I'm talking about. One person in particular is extremely controlling and I have an inkling that they are uncomfortable with someone else, really anyone else, handling valuable projects for the company. \n\nOffice setting are relatively new for me, a challenge with not spending my entire adult career in an office is it's hard to know what's appropriate to express to my similarly aged boss. \n\nI'm afraid of being fired for being \"troublesome\" and pushing back against the historically untouchable golden child department of the company but I am my only advocate. If it's not me then there is no one to step up for me and my department and our companies customers.  \n\nThere is a lot of missing subtext, nuance and history absent from this post. I feel alone and like I don't have anyone to talk to about these frustrations. \n\nAny words of advice for advocating for myself, setting boundaries and navigating an abrasive work atmosphere would be appreciated.",

I ended up in situationships with men who often left me wondering if they cared at all or who left me feeling used. I stopped believing in real love. \n\nI've recently reconnected with the part of me that enjoyed these movies. I'm allowing myself to dream again. \n\nThe world we live in now makes romance difficult. We spend so much time online, on apps, looking at screens. We desperately try to find \"a relationship\" with strangers we meet online. It's easy to feel like romance is dead and that there is no hope. \n\nBut I don't want to settle. I've always been a hopeless romantic and I want to honour that. Who says real love isn't out there waiting for us when we least expect it? Regardless of gender, we are all human beings and humans long for connection deep down.\n\nPerhaps I will never have the great love I long for. But I'm choosing to have hope.

But, I was a little surprised that she wore such a tight, high slit dress especially in the color red to her best friend‚Äôs rehearsal dinner that she‚Äôs a part of and sitting next to the bride for. Maybe the bride just doesn‚Äôt care and is chill with it! I‚Äôm just wondering what you would do if your MOH wore a dress like that to your rehearsal dinner? Would you care or not?",
