        "text": "I'd like to call everybody's attention to one of the sidebar guidelines, and briefly explain why I feel it is so important.\n\n&gt; **Please do not downvote without providing an explanation, even a simple one. This helps everybody understand what we are about.**\n\nWhen you downvote without giving an explanation, it hurts the quality of our sub in two ways. \n\nFirst, it discourages contributors. When somebody posts a comment or a link they found interesting only to watch it get downvoted to 0 without the slightest discussion, they will naturally begin to wonder where they went wrong posting what they did. But without feedback as to what exactly the problem is, they might get the impression that TTR \"just isn't the place for them\" and simply start posting somewhere else. Thus instead of helping contributors become better at posting things the community feels are worthy of discussion we scare them off.\n\nSecond, downvoting without an explanation why takes away a great opportunity for discussion. Some of the best discussions arise when one party is strongly opposed to something, because their opposition gives them both something to write about and a reason to take the time to post. And after all, as stated in the sideboard, TTR is a place where we hope to promote intelligent discussion, not simply a repository for news stories. \n\nSo, to reiterate the guideline above, I sincerely ask all of our readers to think carefully before downvoting. If you feel the article had something truly wrong with it, then take the time to write up a short explanation before you click that down arrow. If it simply left a bad taste in your mouth or rubbed you the wrong way, but doesn't seem bad enough to warrant writing why, then you can choose to vote neither up or down.\n\nWithout a diverse collection of readers and contributors it would be impossible to have a quality discussion about these articles. I understand and fully support the fact that many people will downvote articles I feel are great and vice versa. I just hope that people will be a bit more willing to share their reasons why so that we can all learn more about our fellow man.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I was referring to posts like these two:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TrueTrueReddit/comments/3m2pmy/friends_without_benefits/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TrueTrueReddit/comments/3cdxds/tested_under_fire_when_reagan_was_shot_who_took/\n\nBoth are links to reasonably well-written and interesting articles, and both have been heavily downvoted without even a single comment explaining why. This happens to a lesser extent with a number of articles posted here but those two really made me realize what a huge problem it was.",
