I want to get into the purest of pure computer science degrees so that I can get into the actual frontiers of modern computing. Can anyone help me out here?

Couldn't find an answer so just typed ask computer science reddit into google.\n\nI am researching to write a report for my high school science journal and came upon the topic of Go and computers. More specifically AlphaGo and previous computers playing chess. On [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_\\(game\\)#Computers_and_Go), it says that\n\n&gt; Given an average of 200 available moves through most of the game, for a computer to calculate its next move by exhaustively anticipating the next four moves of each possible play (two of its own and two of its opponent's), it would have to consider more than 320 billion (3.2×1011) possible combinations. To exhaustively calculate the next eight moves, would require computing 512 quintillion (5.12×1020) possible combinations. As of March 2014, the most powerful supercomputer in the world, NUDT's \"Tianhe-2\", can sustain 33.86 petaflops.[121] At this rate, even given an exceedingly low estimate of 10 operations required to assess the value of one play of a stone, Tianhe-2 would require 4 hours to assess all possible combinations of the next eight moves in order to make a single play.\n\nHow come AlphaGo only took a matter of seconds to calculate its moves when playing professional Go players while the most powerful supercomputer takes 4 hours to make a single play?",

Signal rate is how fast we sends signal elements, the unit is Baud (Symbols per second). Now let's assume that the bandwidth B = 100 Hz, then the highest signal rate can't be higher than 2B which is 200 Hz. 100 Hz gives us a period time of 1/100 = 0.01s and during one period we can fit two signal elements. So the signal rate is at a maximum 200 Baud/s which is 2B (or 200Hz). So what we are told is that within a period we can't fit more than two signal elements. Is this really true or does this just apply for this formula?      \n",

On the other hand the Fundamental Frequency of the signal determines the overall frequency for the composite signal and thereby the Data Rate.

My current approach is to pick a point, sort the rest of the points by their distance to that point, build a graph, and then redo that process once you encounter a point that can't be gotten under the threshold.

I am not sure as to how to think about the answer and wasn't sure how to interpret the literature online. I would greatly appreciate help.\n\n**My thought process**: Drawing it out simple practical examples. \n&gt;(S = Start, G = Goal, X = search/expanded), \nAction = {N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SW, SE}, \nh(n) &amp; g(n) are assumed to perfect heuristics that will always expand the best node to goal.\n\nHand Examples\n\nOptLen(1): Opened = 3 \n\nS|X\n-|-\nX|G\n\noptLen(2): opened =  8\n\nS | X | X\n-|-|-\nX|X|X\nX|X|G\n\noptLen(3): opened = 13\n\nS|X|X|-\n-|-|-|-\nX|X|X|X\nX|X|X|X\n-|X|X|G\n\noptLen(4): opened =  18\n\nS|X|X|-|-\n-|-|-|-|-\nX|X|X|X|-\nX|X|X|X|X\n-|X|X|X|X\n-|-|X|X|G\n\nI see that for each increase in the path length the search time goes up by minimum 3 and a maximum of 5 (3 if the node being expanded is NESW, 5 if the node expanded is on the diagonal^note). In the worst case the alg will expand 5 nodes each expansion. 1 node will be expanded next time and so one. so 5 * n which doesn't seem exponential to me. I know I am not taking into account many of the properties of A* but I am not sure of how to incorporate them.\n\n(May X post this to other places!)\n\n^note (Basically when expanding NESW 2 of the expansion that would happen in the diagonal case have already happened)",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I got a question about merge sort. \n\nIn my discrete mathematics class we are learning about algorithms and we just learned about merge sort. \n\nFrom what I understand, merge sort, for example, works like this:\n[8 elements]\n[4 elements] + [4 elements]\n[2] [2] [2] [2]\n1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\nThen it compares the sets of ones to each other and sorts back up to the 8 element set. \n\nHeres my question: why not just start off the 8 element set and just chop it off into 1 element sets right off the bat? Why cut them in half over and over till you get to sets of 1 or 0 elements?\nFor example if you have 11 element set:\n[[1st element] [2nd element]...[11th element]] then combine set with first and second element sorted, together. 3rd +4th... 9th+10th, then go up that way. \n\nAnother question: if I have a set with 2112 elements, wouldn't it be better to first calculate the largest x such that 2^x &lt;= 2112 and start off by splitting the set at (2^x)th location?\nIn the case of 2112, we'd split it into:\n[[2048][64]]\n1028,1028,32,32\nand neither of those numbers will end up with odd sets. But if you split it in the middle you get: \n[1056][1056]\n528,528\nEventually ending with sets of 33 elements. \n\nFinal question: when testing in real life, does merge sort always go down to sets of 1 element and 0 elements? If you have a set of millions of elements, wouldn't it be easier to stop at for example sets of 100 elements and just sort them back up? ",

Adjusting it weekly for nuances in employee's availability is a near constant hassle, and I'm looking to streamline my process.  I recently asked myself the question, can my computer automate the process?  Using a range of factors such as an employee's availability, an employee's trained jobs, an employee's minimum and maximum hours, and the restaurant's \"hour budget\" for a specific day, would it be possible to make a program in excel that could spit out a usable weekly schedule?  Perhaps my expectations for Excel are too high, but I do recall seeing similar programs in the past.  Any guidance that anyone might have for me would absolutely be appreciated!",

In the case of software I think Unit testing and Code Review is sufficient. This should meet SP1.1.\n\nTo meet SP1.2 I will need to state what I will be using to carry out these methods. E.g. a unit test library for unit testing and a checklist for the code review.\n\nTo meet S.P1.3 I will need to outline specifics of how these methods in S.P1.2 will actually be used (the procedure).\n\nBefore I go any further does it look like I am on the right track here? Or am I getting the wrong idea?\n\nMany thanks for any help anyone can provide. \n",

What's your interpretation of the search result?\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to ask. I didn't expect results to portray video games positively for this query. I understand playing video games has positive effects, but I didn't want that. I'm aware the google's algorithm shows more results from News sites.
