That‚Äôs a shitty bait and switch, and turning what was very positive and surprise experience with the film into a sour impression.\n\nFOMO short term movie release on streaming service is insane, and Amazon is screwing around with customers in a way that‚Äôs leaving negative impressions, not the positive buzz they likely want. Sarah Polley‚Äôs film is more important and deserves better treatment than to be used for FOMO money making. And this tactic is frustrating manipulation as a customer.",

But apparently that's just not the case. Yes almost every movie comes out on some streaming service or another, but many of the big blockbusters like Top Gun Maverick and Spider-Man No Way Home are on lesser-subscribed ones like Paramount+ and Starz respectively, instead of streamers that everyone has like Netflix/HBO/etc. So why does nobody rent or purchase them digitally?\n\nI remember the days when people would go to Blockbuster every weekend to rent a movie; for digital movies it's nowhere near that often. The problem is, when that revenue stream of DVD/Blu Ray went away with nothing to replace it, studios have to rely almost entirely on theatrical box office revenue to get their money. This has led them to play it safe, and rely so incessantly on sequels/reboots/franchises.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the 2000s, there has been a decline in the quality of the award-winning movies at the Oscars. Of course, there were some good exceptions (e.g.: Departed, 12 Years a Slave, Birdman, Parasite), but for example in the Best Picture category, very bad (e.g.: Chicago, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Crash, No Country For Old Man, The Artist, The Shape of Water) or poor, uninteresting movies (e.g.: Slumdog Millionaire, Hurt Locker, The King's Speech, Argo, Nomadland) were awarded year by year.\n\nThe Academy made weaker decision this year than ever before. Last time when I was so disappointed was when The Return of the King got 11 awards and become the Best Picture of the year 2003. I‚Äôm sure that this year‚Äôs Best Picture pick is even a worse than that. \n\nThe EEAAO was a two-and-a-half-hour pointless, brainless thing that barely beat the level of a random Marvel movie. Nothing to say, nothing meaningful, nothing innovative or outstanding. Instead, there were some idiotic brawl scenes, hot dog fingers, and fighting with dildos, stretching so long that the movie became one of the most boring experiences of the year for me. Would this really be the best movie of the year?\n\nThere was a time when movies such as Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Annie Hall, Rain Man, Schindler's List or American Beauty was the Best Picture. Where are we today from that level of quality? How could we mention EEAAO on the same page as  let‚Äôs say Schindler's List?\n\nEEAAO should have been left as a simple popcorn movie, because let's face it, EEAAO is a lousy popcorn movie. The Oscars should be about honoring outstanding achievements in the film industry. For me, EEAAO was not outstanding, it was one of the many meaningless action movies of today. I cringed through the entire movie and was just waiting for the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, not only to talk about Best Picture, here are some categories where I think the Academy made a bad decision:  \n\n\n* Best Actress: Cate Blanchett should have won instead of Michelle Yeoh. Cate Blanchett's performance in T√°r was more powerful, strong and significant than Michelle Yeoh's in EEAAO\n* Best Supporting Actor: Brendan Gleeson should have won instead of Ke Huy Quan ,who, I think, only received the award because he returned to filmmaking after a long break and, let's face it, he is not so talented that he still has a chance to even get a nomination. In contrast to Gleeson,  who has shown many times what kind of emotional, dramatic performances he is capable of. \n* Best Supporting Actress:  None of the nominees were memorable to me. I like Jamie Lee Curtis and most of her movies, but what she did in EEAAO is not worthy of an Oscar, not even with this weak list\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I think it's a shame for the Academy that while the EEAAO took home 7 awards, the creators of the Banshees of Inisherin went home empty-handed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd not to say only bad things about this year's Oscars, here are two positive things for me:\n\n* Brendan Fraser became the Best Actor. He deserved it. Congrats!\n* All Quiet on the Western Front's 4 awards were well deserved. I think that movie is the movie of the year. With good music, nice cinematography, a great story. Unforgettable, shocking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: The 95th Academy Awards was a disappointing event for me. I was a little freaked out by the award winners, especially the EEAAO.",

Kathleen Turner at her best. Mickey Rourke at his best for that era. It has a clean aesthetic and a compelling story and an ending that... don't look it up.",

More Prestige Projects?\n\nAll In All, I am happy that Fraser is experiencing a career comeback thanks to The Whale after many years of being dormant and now that he has an Oscar, his stock value went up and will probably be the talk of the town with many will ask Fraser to join their movies.\n\nWhere will Brendan Fraser's career go?",

I've watched it in recent years and finally bought the Criterion Collection Blu Ray, reconstructed and restored with additional scenes making the already long movie grow to 197 minutes.\n\nIt stars some of the biggest comedians and actors from the early 60s and earlier, most probably forgotten by today's generation, but even if you don't know them, they're hilarious.\n\nThe movie is a nonstop vehicle chase across California involving a variety of cars, and even an airplane (owned by Mr. Howell!).",
