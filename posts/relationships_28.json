        "text": "My girlfriend and I have a very strong relationship. For the most part I feel and always have felt that we are almost the same person. We have been together just under a year but I have known her for around 4. I really care about her, more than anyone else I’ve been with, I know Im young but that doesn’t mean it’s not true. I love her and I have for awhile, I loved her as a friend which shifted into loving her romantically shortly before I asked her out.\n\nShe’s like my dream girl and she has done so much for me, physically, mentally, and more. We’re best friends. The only problem is that recently she doesn’t have a very high sex drive. At the beginning of our relationship we had a very strong sex life, it was amazing. It slowly disappeared however, and we haven’t done anything for over a month. It started off with her stopping in the middle of sex, and then refusing my advances. \n\nI stopped my advances all together because I felt like I was burdening her and assumed that I’d just give her space with this. I should mention that her previous partner had done sexual things with her at inappropriate times and without her consent. So I completely understand why sex would be hard for her and Im patient. My sex drive, however, never stops. It’s to the point that I often wonder if I am a sex addict. I want her sexually like nothing I have ever felt before and it has only gotten worse over the past month without contact. \n\nA week ago we talked about it for the first time and I told her that I do not attempt to initiate sex anymore. She seemed saddened by that and then asked if I would still like her if she was Asexual. I said of course because I would despite being shocked and obviously upset by it. She told me that she isn’t sure and is still exploring herself but that it’s likely not true due to her experiencing this before. Her sex drive disappears only to re-emerge at an inconsistent time down the line. I changed the subject as to not upset her further, I don’t want to make this harder on her. Sex is important to me in a relationship but not as important as her.\n\nThe next morning I had to pack up and leave for my dads house (2 hours away) to help work on his house for sale and I have been here ever since. She also rarely texts me while Im here, she works a busy job so I understand but this has been the worst time yet. I have been here for a week and today is the first time we have spoken since I left. I’ve brought up this bothering me before but nothing has changed and it makes me feel somewhat ignored despite her being busy, especially since I can see her active on social media after she gets out of work but she still doesn’t text me. I began feeling extremely sexually pent up while here, porn was not satisfying me and only making it worse.\n\nI tried cutting out the porn and solely fantasizing about my partner through imaginary means, it worked at first but then became frustrating as well. I began to fantasize about other women I know, I didn’t want to; it felt like they just slipped into my head. I tried to put them out of my head but wasn’t the most successful. All of this on top of not speaking to her is frustrating me and making me feel guilty.\n\nI suddenly had an idea. I felt as if I knew a compromise. This is a bit embarrassing to admit but as a younger lad I would engage in erotic text-based role-plays through discord. I told myself that I can stop fantasizing about other women through this erotic role-play. If I found a stranger, a faceless partner to role-play with I could fantasize about my girlfriend while venting my sexual desires in a situation that felt “real” (Extremely ass backwards logic I know but I was so sexually frustrated and likely making excuses for myself…) I found a discord server that specified in that type of thing and within a few minutes I was role-playing with someone I didn’t know in the slightest. \n\nWe didn’t share names, pictures or anything like that. Just a friendly hello into the role-play it did work for me. I was able to fantasize about me and my GF in the role-play situations and it satisfied these urges I had. In the moment I wasn’t even thinking about the other person behind the screen and almost forgot they were there. It was almost like I was reading a steamy book about myself and my girlfriend. After the deed was done and that infamous post-nut clarity kicked in I began to feel wrong, dirty and guilty. I realized “Holy shit. I was talking to another person” something I knew, but only then truly began to think about. I know it was wrong and inexcusable, that I only have myself to blame. Ive given my story, reasons, feelings and actions to ask a couple questions.\n\nI have spent enough time deeply thinking in guilt to come to the conclusion that I was wrong to compromise by myself, that I should have compromised with my girlfriend and need to fully communicate my feelings and needs with her, and lastly that if she is so important to me then I need to never let this happen again. It won’t because after my realization I no longer have the urge to do so and also no longer have much of a sex drive. So I don’t need to be told these things. I am also aware that only one opinion truly matters and that is my girlfriend’s. So should I tell her? If so how to do so without possibly losing her? is that even possible? Have I even earned the right to communicate my wants and needs with her after this? Considering all of the context, including that I was using the role-play to fantasize about my significant other and that the stranger behind the screen meant nothing to me besides a means to an end, was it unfaithful? If so was it as bad as cheating? Am I a bad person/boyfriend? Is my situation understandable? I want to be a good person and an even better boyfriend for her. She deserves the world truly and I love her. I want her to be the only person in my eyes and would never do this again. I have done a good bit of research on this and have found similar cases on this subreddit so Im aware Im gonna get different opinions. My goal is to hear everyone out so I can understand myself and my situation better before I move onto making my own decisions on the matter and hopefully become the person she needs and knows I can be as she for myself and for her. She has always been my biggest supporter and I try very hard to be that for her. Please help me!! \n \nand thank you all for reading and hearing me out. \n\nTL;DR: My partner and I have been distant recently. I have been feeling sexually pent up and porn/other outlets wasn’t helping. I recently engaged in an erotic role-play with a complete faceless stranger over the internet, all the while I was fantasizing about and pretending it was with my girlfriend. Am I terrible? How do I move forward? Please read the paragraph just above his Tl;DR segment for more questions and the kind of answer Im truly looking for. Thank you.",

        "text": "We've been dating now for 9 months, and while we have a great relationship, he's made some offhand comments that make me wonder if he really knows me.\n\nI come off sarcastic and often joke about things, but when something serious is happening, I take it seriously and I do my best. He should know this, as two months into our relationship he was going through something and I helped him through it.\n\nHowever, I think he still only sees me as sarcastic and never taking things seriously.\n\nThe first time he said something was like 3/4 months in. We were talking about my sister's wedding and I just said I was a bit upset because she's asked me to be MoH but would prefer I don't give a speech. He said she probably has her reasons, and then said I'll probably make too many jokes and not be serious. I was a bit upset that he thought this, but didn't really say anything.\n\nThen recently, we've vaguely spoken about moving in together. We've done so before, and it's always seemed that his plan before we met was to get a place of his own. I thought this would still go ahead and I'd just move in later, which I thought I'd made clear I was fine with. When we spoke about it yesterday, he made a comment that I'd probably be \"offended\" if he bought a place by himself first. It seemed in a jokey way, but I'm just not sure. I told him I wouldn't and I thought that was the plan, and we just moved on.\n\nI do have a tendency to overthink, as you can probably tell. I just don't like the idea that he's got this impression of me that I'd be upset if he got his own place. I don't know whether to just ask him if he did mean it as a joke, but I don't want him to see me as super anxious either.\n\nTl;dr - I don't know if I'm being too anxious, or if my boyfriend sees me as not too serious and he has the wrong impression of me.",

I get asked out all the time but I guess tend to shy away from people and then the ones I do go after always seem to want one thing. Maybe I’m too gullible in thinking people are honest. \n\nEven my guy friends will tell me how pretty and smart I am and flirt but in the past when they have been single show no interest in me or will be very wish washy.\n\nI “dated” this one guy for a few months last year and he would constantly comment about my personality and what an amazing body I had ect. He one day ghosted me and stole one of my bathing suits calling it his trophy.\n\nI’ve had three guys now been either been married or in a serious long term relationship lead me on. I found out eventually… like I literally had married men trying to show up to my house and crying because I wanted to stop talking after I found out. Wtf if wrong with people like it’s over I’m not ok with it \n\nOne guy I started talking to a week ago. We have followed each other in instagram for YEARS and I always thought he was attractive and share the same interests hence why I followed him. We just started talking and it got spicy very fast… I was curious to see if he saw single and did some digging and found a girl it seems like he was serious with. She’s so pretty! And seems to have a great job ect. Pics with their family but they hadn’t posted anything in a month. I was like maybe they broke up? \n\nFast forward to tonight we are flirting and he goes silent for 4 hours so I decide to creep. They were together!! Then he texted me how much he wants to fuck me right now. I feel disgusting \n\nI’ve had two exes (I guess I initiated breaking up) reach out 5-6 years later confessing their love for me because they are about to get married. Like what are they expecting. \n\nI’m so frustrated and I feel over dating and even trying. What is it about me I don’t understand.\n\nTl;dr : \n\nMen are weird with me. Everyone tells me all these good qualities about me but no one very wants long term. I’m always getting lead in in the hopes of having a serious relationship and get used or in situations where they are partnered. I feel disgusting about it and dirty.",

        "text": " I'm sorry for the long post, but it requires a lot of context. I'm basically scared that I might be in legal trouble, or possibly physical danger, but im not sure. Id really appreciate any advice.\n\nI've been doing long distance with my girlfriend for more than a year, we met in-person twice and we now live in the same state ever since I transferred colleges. She was 16 and I was 19 when we first started talking. Her mom is diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia, and is known to be very abusive towards my girlfriend. She is extremely paranoid and doesn't let my girlfriend go out often, and doesn't even allow her to attend a normal high school (she goes to an online-only school). Hence why we've only met twice. We would call each other and text each other every day/night. My girlfriend turned 18 in February, and has never planned on moving out, she wanted to fix/sustain her relationship with her mom as much as possible while also being with me, I think she was hoping her mom would eventually come around. But instead, a week ago her mom discovered us and I haven't been able to get in contact with my gf, besides through the shared emergency email we had (we made this when her mom would have delusional episodes before and made her switch phones.) She told me that her mom found everything: the key things she said were to \"delete anything too crazy/insane\"(referring to any flirty/sexual conversations we may have had), \"i love you forever, be safe\", and \"i wont be able to talk to you for a very long time.\" This was Monday.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. On Wednesday, her friend (We'll call her T), texted my girlfriend's friend A, that my girlfriend was safe and at her house. Friend A showed me a screenshot of this. At this point I'm wondering why they haven't contacted me directly. Both Friend A and I DM her on Instagram asking more questions, like how she got there (my girlfriend has no car or license, and her mom has her phone). But friend T doesn't answer friend A and just blocks me. Today (Friday) I ask my gf's friend S; no answer. I ask my gf's friend G if my gf is okay, she replies:\n\n\"yes, she is safe but i don't think i can give you any more information.\"\n\nand then later:\n\n\"I heard from her more recently than Monday, but I do know that she was explicitly and specifically told she cant speak to you or friend A\"\n\n\"her mom has her old phone and access to everything, id suggest you don't message until you hear from her first, but i don't know how long that will be\"\n\n\"she said that her mom found like everything ever and that she isn't allowed to talk to you or friend A for legal reasons for a very long time\"\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this. But the key things I picked out that I can infer from was that:\n\n1. \"I don't think i can give you any more information.\" \"she isn't allowed to talk to you or friend A for legal reasons\" She (and maybe friend G and T) are involved with some legal situation, possibly against my gf's mom.\n2. \"her mom has her old phone\" My gf must have a new phone, which shes yet to contact me or friend A with.\n\nI have 2 possible theories:\n\n1. Before i stopped hearing from my gf, she said in our shared email that her mom thinks im a human trafficker. I believe that it's possible her mom is trying to build a case that I am some kind of creep who has been stalking her daughter for more than a year and has moved here to come kidnap her. I've been sending messages to my girlfriend's email and her Instagram this whole time without knowing it is her mom, but friend G said her mom has access to it. I've since changed the passwords on everything. This could be where a legal case might be involved. Maybe my gf and her friends' families helped her get some kind of legal help to combat that? I just don't understand what possible reasons there could be for her or them to not tell me information or why she cant contact me. Could I be interfering with some kind of investigation if she contacts me? My dad and friends think that she could just not be contacting me to leave me out of the situation to not be stressed out (i have school and exams and stuff currently).\n2. Her mom could be attempting to file a restraining order against me? But I don't see how this would affect me if my gf isn't at her moms house anymore (assuming that she isn't). And as my gf is 18, her mom wouldn't be able to file it on her behalf.\n\nWhat I'm worried about:\n\n1. Her mom has access to EVERYTHING. every conversation I've ever had with my girlfriend, every photo I've shared, every photo shes shared. our private images, our private conversations. We were both always of the legal age of consent since we've started talking. I couldn't get in trouble right?\n2. Her mom knows my phone number because i sent it in our shared email so that my gf doesn't forget if she needs to call me. She knows that I live in the same city. And possibly knows what school I go to if she was able to get it out of my gf. She might even know my address. I don't know.\n3. Her mom has had a history of being violent, she once pulled a gun on her ex-boyfriend bc she accused him of going to assassinate her and my gf. my gf called the cops on her.\n\nTL;DR - Gf's mom is schizophrenic and thinks im some kind of threat to her daughter, who I've met twice and been in a long-distance relationship for more than a year, but we now live within an hour of each other. Her mom just discovered our relationship and took her phone, my gf is off the grid and her friends are saying she cant talk to me or one of her other friends for 'legal reasons'. I'm worried that I could be in physical danger from her mom or possibly some kind of legal trouble, and Im confused as to why my gf hasn't said anything to me yet.\n\nShould I be worried? What should I be careful of? Is there a way to unsend everything on Instagram? (that's the app we've always used to communicate.) What legal reasons could it be that she isn't allowed to contact me or friend A for a very long time? What possible reasons could there be for her to avoid contacting me?",

She felt like my mom didn’t do anything when some family allegedly was talking badly about her and her behavior. She started screaming at our mother while her baby was sitting by her feet, crying her eyes out because of this outburst. She wouldn’t stop screaming at our mom even when our mom kept telling her to stop and that the baby is crying, but she kept on going. I went over to pick up the baby and get her out of the situation, and at that point I was grabbed and things got out of hand as described above.\n\nTl;dr My sister blames getting of if birth control for her shaking me aggressively and screaming in my face.

They were either old or enhanced in some way. One of his first comments in person was \"You look better than your pictures!\". I decided to be nice and just go on the first date without complaining. After that, he really steps up and is really attentive. We have a lot of interests, hobbies, and goals in common. I decided to be intimate with him after about a month. Now, we seem to only be intimate. He is affectionate and gentle with me. When I asked him why he likes going out with me he said \"You were only person to reply back\". this bothered me a bit, and I decided to ghost him. He started taking me on more traditional dates again. Then it just went back to normal after about two weeks. Is this just a sex thing? \n\nTL;DR: New guy claims he wants a relationship, but it seems like we only have sex. When I try to end it, he's emotional at the time.",

        "text": "I(F25) kissed my co worker (M30). We had been friends for 10 months. 8 out of those 10 months I didn’t know that he was in a messy on again/off again relationship. He took me out for drinks one day during work and told me him and his gf had broken up and he wanted to kiss me. I said no even though we had gotten close and flirted previously. Everyone at work told me he liked me and he had admitted it and I should give him a chance. So a week later while I was drunk, I ask him to kiss me. At first he said not like this (as in not when we were drunk) but then eventually we kiss. I don’t know the details but it lasted a few seconds and then I left before more could happen( he asked to go further and I said no). I felt horrible after the kiss. I even cried. For 1. I felt horrible for his gf(ex?). I shouldn’t have kissed him while they were in their messy relationship. 2. I felt bad because I came onto him when I shouldn’t have. I just felt like if we kissed and I didn’t feel anything I would get over it. 3. I didn’t feel anything towards him and it’s the biggest mistake I’ve made in my entire life. He assured me the next day that him and his gf were not together and that they were broken up. I believed him but then over the last few months I’ve noticed that his behaviour in general is very slimey and he is a cheater. He most likely lied to me when we kissed and I feel even worse now. I can’t blame anyone but myself because I came onto him and practically threw myself on him to kiss me just because I was needy and insecure and thought he liked me and I would like him if we kissed. Now that I look back I’m ashamed. I stayed friends with him until I realized he was a liar and a cheater and then blocked him on everything. I feel horrible. How do I let this go?? How do I move on?? I can’t talk to my friends or family because they’ll hate me or judge me for my actions and I’ve spent the last few months doing that already so how can I let it go?? Can I make it right??? I am so sorry that it happened but I can’t change the past. I feel so ashamed and guilty all the time. I’ve even had thoughts about hurting myself because the guilt is so overwhelming and I feel so stupid for my actions. The last thing I ever wanted was to hurt someone else and the thought of that is making me want to hurt myself. I struggle with mental health issues and am super against cheating or any kind so the fact that I put myself in this position is really taking it’s toll on me. I’ve prayed to my god and I’ve been to a therapist but I just cannot seem to let go of this guilt and I really need help or else I don’t know what to do with myself. I do have ROCD. I just can’t turn my brain off. I feel so horrible for hurting an innocent person. I keep replaying the instance over and over again in my head and trying to remember everything. I keep going crazy. I just want this to stop. I feel like I want to hurt myself really badly. Please help me.\n\nTL:DR : diagnosed with real life event OCD. Became the other woman by kissing a guy while he was in a messy on/off again relationship. Can’t stop thinking about it or wanting to hurt myself. Please help.",

Basically what im trying to say is that things are getting serious. And I feel like I’m trying to slow down time because im a college student, got this relationship, toxic family, therapy, ahhh lol.

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nmy SO \\[26F\\] and I \\[26M\\] are together for about 4 years, currently temporarily in a long distance relationship (\\~6 months). We are having some issues with communication. It is a very stressful time in her life, and she barely communicates with me. I tried openly communicating my issue with this with her, and though we did seem to come to an agreement that she will try more, every time I raised this topic she threw my behavior of the past in my face: I had a very stressful time last year, and was constantly tired, eventually also getting COVID and having long-COVID symptoms for 2 months – basically I was not my full self for \\~4 months, partly because of my own choices of taking on too much work, partly because of no fault of my own (COVID). We talked a lot about it back then because this made her quite unhappy (having to spend time with exhausted me, never getting energized me), but she really tried her best when I was sick and I promised her to have more time and energy after the temporary stay abroad.\n\nStill I find it hard not to interpret her lack of communication as a lack of interest, though she tells me that she would rather only talk to me when she has the energy instead of trying to squeeze me in somewhere in her busy schedule. She directly relates this to my behavior last year: That she was unhappy when I tried to spend time with her even though I didn't have the energy, and that she doesn't want to do the same to me. For me it seems that this leads to us not talking at all, since she never actually finds any time, and thus I feel lonely in the relationship. She also says that she does not want to show me her negative emotions, and this I find crazy considering that we have been together for 4 years and I've seen her at her lows and she has seen me at mine. Part of me also worries that she does not want to talk to me because she sees me as another potential stressor; and since most of our longer conversations lately have been about this communication issue, it might not be too far fetched.\n\nI am also wondering whether this 'you did this to me, so I have the right to do this to you'-thinking is healthy, or if it is a precursor to resentment. It sometimes feels like in our relationship we have built a set of precedence cases determining what is okay and what is not, like our constitution is not based on principles but on precedences.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR:** Is 'you did this to me, so I have the right to do this to you'-thinking unhealthy? Should I worry if my SO does not want to talk to me when she is stressed?",

        "text": "My (19M) boyfriend and I (18F) are semi-long distance. \n\nMy boyfriend has 3 roommates. One of which is genuinely the worst person I have ever met. To make it brief, this roommate is a pervert, groomer, and assaulter. Unfortunately, none of which has been taken to the authorities due to lack of physical evidence. He also is a slob, doesn't clean up after himself, and doesn't do his share of chores. \n\nI've refused to go over to my boyfriends place due to this. Plus, it causes my boyfriend a lot of stress living with such a horrible person. He's come to me crying about how much housework he's had to do due to his roommate not pulling his fair share. \n\nThe other roommates, including my boyfriend, are refusing to do or say anything about this roommate. My boyfriend refuses to confront him because he absolutely depises confrontation and has since allowed this roommate to walk all over him.\n\nI have consistently talked about him going to therapy to try and combat this fear of confrontation (amongst other things that he's been dealing with). He hasn't gotten back to me on what his diction he's made. \n\nMy boyfriend and his friend group of 6 (including his two nice roommates and one awful one) have been considering renting a full house instead of an apartment. I asked if either way he is going to stay with their current roommate situation. He got quiet and refused to answer me. \n\nThis is something I can no longer stand. I see my boyfriend, maybe once a week, due to my refusal to go to his apartment. I can't stand doing this for another two years while he finishes college. I'm going to text him tonight and tell him that if he re-news his lease or rents this new house with this awful roommate, I'm going to have to seriously consider the longevity of our relationship.\n\nTLDR; My semi-longdistance boyfriend has a God awful roommate. I refuse to go to his apartment due to this. My boyfriend refuses to confront his roommate about his behavior and actions. My boyfriend told me that the rommates and him are planning on renting a house next lease-period. I'm going to tell him if he re-leases this apartment or if he rents a new house with this bad roommate I'm likley going to leave him.",

        "text": "We met in summer 2019. We quickly “fell in love”- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt “head over heels” and she (34f) felt the same. She’s the most naturally beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other’s families and things were getting serious—saying “I love you” and making plans for our shared future—right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I’m “as handsome as ever”, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then— she had a boyfriend and we shouldn’t have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn’t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that “was music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‘long game’” because she wasn’t single.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she “does love me, but is scared.” After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like “we shouldn’t have done that”) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. \n\nI got routinely hurt—really badly—by her cruel hot/cold treatment of me. As an example, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would disagree with me in front of everyone. I also caught her in a lie—we had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn’t feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying “can’t wait to see you tonight” which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she double booked herself, but “really wasn’t feeling well.” I then went “no contact” in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship. Seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she realized over the last couple of months how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we were saying “I love you,” going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. Happiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, more critical of me than normal (I couldn’t do anything right; making the bed, cooking, she told me I was “annoying” and “cringey” in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner—usually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts—cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. In the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced “love bombing” —she would say things like “I hope our kids have your face,” “I can’t wait to move in with you,””I love you,” “I’m crazy about you” and “you’re so important to me.” This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she’s now in a “serious” relationship and doesn’t “feel right about seeing each other one-on-one.” I told her I still love her, she simply said that was “problematic” and she said she wanted me to leave her alone. The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI see their all her family now follow him on social media, which is more than I ever got. He has eclipsed me and I can’t get over it. I feel worthless and the anxiety of them being together and me unable to do anything about it is horrible, unbearable. \n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, please share because I’m at a loss and can’t get over it. Thanks for reading. \n\nTL/DR: my ex (34f) and I dated for 8 months in ‘19-20, and she ended things very suddenly right when our relationship was getting serious. I went NC, but we reconnected over a year later. She was seeing someone else at this point. She broke up with him not long after and we got back together. She kept me at arms length though and dumped me again. We got back together in the Spring of last year, yet again. She claimed to realize how much she missed me. We were going on weekend trips with her parents, saying “I love you” and planning to move in together; even talk of our future children. Well, she dumped me out of the blue— yet again—after 4 months. She’s now in a “serious relationship” and I’m spiraling into a depression. I can’t move on or stop thinking about her.",

        "text": "TL;DR my partner is mean to his friend and I dunno if I can maintain our relationship because of his actions. \n\nMy partner is by all accounts a wonderful man. He's kind, caring, gentle, creative, and just as nerdy as I am. We've spent a wonderful two years and some change together, growing our careers and lives together. I own an antique furniture store/restoration shop where I do a lot of work with my hands, and he's in the antique jewelry selling business. We have been loosely planning on buying a house (we've lived separately) and really getting serious about our relationship. I'm absolutely in love with his dog and him, and was completely ready to start this journey with him, but what he told me about his longest standing friendship has made me reconsider.\n\nSo with the industry he's in, he does get kind of \"Hollywood\" sometimes. He's met celebrities, rubbed shoulders with movers and shakers, and even has contact information for people you see in the movies and hear on the radio. I think a symptom of this is he can be judgemental and... catty. I think that's the best word for it.\n\nCue his best longtime friend, who we'll call Alice. Alice is a very nice, warm, and friendly woman. I've met her on several occasions and always enjoyed her company. She grew up in a *very* affluent east coast (US) family, and has never wanted for anything. She does art, writes poetry, and is generally a woowoo sort of woman with her crystals and such living in LA. She's not particularly talented at most things she does, but I'll always support someone for creating and doing their own thing. Lately she's been on a kick thinking she sees number patterns in every day life and sent my partner an example with the number 5 on a food receipt saying \"SEE? I TOLD YOU.\" I think most these things are a bit ridiculous but what my partner said next after he showed me those texts has changed the way I feel about him.\n\nHe admitted he's only stayed friends with her for *years* because he loves to laugh at her, and her (in his mind) perceived incompetence at life makes him feel superior. He openly makes fun of her to me and its often fairly ruthless. Like... what if he talks the same about me with other people? What if he secretly thinks I'm also less than worthy somehow?\n\nBecause of her family's wealth, he's also stated he's maintaining the friendship incase we can benefit from their properties in hip neighborhoods in LA and London, or just basically mooch off of Alice and her husband.\n\nI just don't know if I can be with a person who is that two-faced, exploitative, and frankly *mean* to someone they've maintained a \"friendship\" with for all these years. Frankly it grosses me out. I know that I should just openly communicate this with him, but seeing as both our families are sort of old school southern/Midwestern folk, they barely tolerate me being gay let alone talking about our relationship. I'll absolutely have a conversation with him about this soon but I just wanted to come here for some external thoughts and perspectives. Much love, y'all.",

        "text": "Okay, so I need help. Me and my boyfriend are in a long distance relationship. And we reach our 2 years this year. I love him to death, but we argue so much and I just don’t know if I’m in the wrong or if he’s in the wrong. Recently, I asked, jokingly if I could go through his instagram messages. He said, no so quick and got a little upset at me for asking. I didn’t think too much of it at first, but of course I’m a big over thinker so immediately I was like.. what is he hiding. So, we ended up compromising and he said he’ll screen share his messages instead of giving me his password. Of course, he only went through the girls. And, one girl in particular caught my attention. Pressed on the messages, and turns out he met this girl at a concert from last year and he ended up asking for her number. And proceeded to say, “you’re going to be new bestfriend”.\n\nRemind you we’re both fairly young, so this is more of a young person thing to do. I was a little taken back by it, because it wasn’t even her asking for his number, he asked for hers to “keep in contact”. He kept telling me he wanted to make a new friend but of course I didn’t take it like that, because he gets mad at me for not “doing enough” when a dude ask for my number. Remind you, I at least tell the dudes I have a boyfriend and I’m not interested. But, it’s like I felt so disrespected. And even though it was last year, it just makes me wonder if he has done this more than once. For a week straight, we were arguing over the same topic. And he would get upset at me for bringing up that topic over and over again. And, I’ve stopped now and I’ve been trying to move on…\n\nBut, I can’t. And, I have this urge to bring it up again because he always talks about going to all these concerts and parties and I just can’t help but feel like he’s going to do it again.. This is not even the first situation I’ve cause him being extremely friendly with other females. He has this female friend at school and he’s always putting hearts under post, she posted an “appreciation video” for him on tiktok, I’ve seen videos of him being fed by her, her legs were on him while they were sharing a booth together, they’ve gone shopping together, and pretty much go everywhere with eachother.\n\nI hate to say it, but I don’t trust him as I thought I would and I’m trying to convince myself I do. And I truly do want it to work out, but I can’t help but to think what other things he has done. And remind you I have told him multiple times that I don’t like how friendly he is with females, and then he’ll keep doing stuff that isn’t so reassuring to me like going to parties all the time, replying back to old girls who used to mess with him, it just so much. But he gets upset at me that I repeat the same things over and over again. And, after looking through his instagram messages he has so many deleted messages with other girls. I need help\n\n**TL;DR: Me (18F) and My long distance boyfriend (18M) have been in a relationship for almost 2 years and he is extremely friendly to females but swears they're just friends.**",

It's not an extreme level of distance, but it's slowly occurring and is very noticeable. We went from texting each other all day every day, to every now and then. Today, our conversations were very brief and few as he hung out with a girl that apparently has a crush on him to do a group project for 5 hours. ***5 hours.*** I remember him telling me a while ago that his ex girlfriend called him and that she wanted to hang out with him on Saturday, which is today, which also so happens to be the same day he hangs out with this girl.\n\nI'm beginning to get worried that I'm not the only one, and that he's losing interest. We called for the first time yesterday and seemed to get along really well, which is why I don't understand what's happening. Am I just being dramatic and letting my anxiety take over me or is something not right?\n\n***TL;DR:*** **Boyfriend seems to be becoming more distant by the day despite us having a really good connection. Boyfriend also still has contact with ex and hung out with a girl for supposedly 5 hours just to work on a project and became extremely dry and disinterested.**",

        "text": "I (24f) met my gf (28f) Elsie three years ago right before the pandemic on tinder. Back then I had a lot of internalized homophobia and didn’t want to make the relationship official, even though I new Elsie was in love with me, so we stayed friends (WITHOUT benefits, although we were way closer than friends normally are) up until last November when I got my head out of my arse and finally asked her to be my gf. We’ve been VERY happy since, and I try to make up the time I left her waiting with all the love i have in my heart.\n\nI also have my best friend Tina (f26). I know her since we were 8yo. I used to joke she was half my soul we were so close, but for four or three years I’ve noticed that I changed a lot, but she stayed the same. When we were 14 we were both very depressed and joked about self harm, had no plans for the future and abhorred every attempt at getting help from doctors and such. Ive been to therapy, dropped out of a college course I hated to pursue something I love, got over my self hatred and internalized homophobia but Tina just… didn’t. I tried to get her help, talked to her, offered to pay for her therapy, been a shoulder to cry on for many many years, but she’s rejected all the substancial help.\n\nTina also has a fatal flaw: she lies a lot. I think she’s compulsive. She lies mostly about little things, changes stories to make them juicier, but sometimes she straight up concocts an entire story about someone doing something they absolutely did not do. I’ve confronted her about this. She seemed genuinely confused and lost, and after talking to a mutual friend who confirmed she told them this a few years back, I believe her mind is so addled she genuinely can’t tell which story is real and which is fake.\n\nA while back, while drunk, Tina said she was in love with me. I’m not sure if I believe her, but because of this and other reasons, I decided to give our friendship a break. I couldn’t be her crutch anymore and it didn’t feel healthy. Today I vented to my gf about this, she seemed hesitant to tell me something, and eventually the dam broke.\n\nElsie said that for years now, while we were just friends, Tina has been telling her in a “joking” manner that I never wanted or will want Elsie, that I’d been talking to my ex boyfriend for weeks and we’d get back together, that I told Tina she wasn’t allowed to flirt or hook up with Elsie because I was jealous???? ALL LIES. Oh and to make things worse, after all that SHE TRIED TO HOOK UP WITH ELSIE. REPEATEDLY. Elsie never told me that before because she’s a sweetheart and didn’t want to break me and Tina’s friendship.\n\nNow I just feel very betrayed by my (ex?) best friend for spreading those lies, and for what reason? To fuck Elsie? To fuck me over? To make sure our relationship wouldn’t flourish? I honestly think she’s just a very troubled woman, and I genuinely love her, but i don’t know what else to do to help. I’m tired of trying. Should I confront her about this to get it over with? Or just let it lie and quietly put some distance between us?\n\nTL:DR: my best friend since childhood is very troubled and has a lying problem, and today I found out she lied to my partner about me with the intent to break us up before we even got together",

I’m average looking at best I guess.  I don’t know what I did in my past life to struggle with women but I haven’t any luck. I got bullied really badly all through school. Didn’t go to prom, didn’t have a date. I watched all my friends have girlfriends and have sex in high school and in college. It’s hard not to get resentful when you’re trying your best and have nothing to show for it. I’ve tried the self improvement route. I’ve put myself out there a bit more. Still no luck. Here I am, 25 still no relationship. It’s getting frustrating. I’m really starting ti give up for good. I still feel extremely bad about being a virgin. I know I’ll get bullied for being a virgin but I really don’t care anymore. I’ve had maybe one or two situations that didn’t work out. The girl I’ve recently been getting to know just told me she’s not a virgin and has been with 9 guys. It’s frustrating to know pretty much every girl in your age range has been with guys and you won’t be anybody’s first. It’s intimidating and pathetic to have your first time at my age. I feel robbed. I feel robbed of experiences I feel like pretty much everyone else got. I just want a normal life. I’m having a hard time trusting because of this.\n\nTL;DR - Feeling about bad about being a virgin.",

I'm pretty sure she likes me back because whenever we hang out with our friend group, we will usually play some kind of sport and she always wants to be on my team. Also earlier in the year we were looking at our school pictures and she was complementing mine. Sometimes her comments kinda confuse me though, like the other day we were hanging out in a group and she said something about how theres a lot she doesnt like about me but i have really good taste in music, so I dont know what to make of that. Starting two weeks from now we are getting a new class together and I want to use that to get to know her better and hopefully ask her on a date. I just dont want to make things awkward because the only group of friends she has is my friend group and if she rejects me, I'm probably gonna get made fun of for the rest of the year by them. She already \"dated\" one of the guys in the group but they were together for a few hours until she friendzoned him.\n\nSo how should I go about asking her out?\n\nTLDR: I have fallen for a girl in my friend group and need help getting her to go out with me",

I texted her and told her to text me every so often, that her being at his house alone will NOT become a regular occurrence, and the only reason I'm not demanding her to come back home is because Jacob has a girlfriend.

We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (don't dislike each other just don't interact much). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. I also noticed if I ever mention my (soon to be) ex she can get a bit quiet.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested/showing interest. She doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.",

        "text": "It's driving me crazy and I don't know how to get him to stop. We've been together for 4 years and he's literally always done this. We've talked about it many many times but it seems like he truly can't stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll give the latest example. This morning I told him about a couple of MINOR issues I was having (one with my mom, one at work). Both minor issues. We talked about it, he gave me his opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater we went shopping and his bank card was locked because he apparently entered the pin incorrectly. I told him, no problem...let's just call the bank and they'll reset it (he's done this before). While waiting on hold on the phone he's having his usual stress meltdown. Muttering, swearing. I'm used to this and I felt a bit of anxiety because I KNEW what he would start doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe started telling me that I'm totally wrong about everything. That my thoughts about the issues with work and my mom are TOTALLY WRONG. I told him that's fine, they were just minor issues and I didn't really have any firm thoughts about them anyway. But he just kept arguing that I was WRONG in my thinking. Then immediately jumped to asking me if I did X, Y and Z that he had asked me to do. He literally just asked me to do these things this morning so no, I hadn't gotten to them yet. So then he starts going on about how he needs someone who will help him, act as a team, blah blah blah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize he's ONLY doing this because he's stressed in the moment. And he truly doesn't seem to be able to control it. He gets so stressed over the most minor things that are easy to fix, and he lashes out at me over anything he can dredge up in that moment. As soon as the issue is fixed (in this case they reset his pin) he's back to normal and being loving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I find it to be a total turnoff. In fact I've found myself becoming less attracted to him because one of my hacks is to try to view him as a scared little boy having a tantrum when he starts this shit (to avoid getting mad at him and arguing and trying to defend myself over nonsense) but that's backfiring into me viewing him that way all the time. Which isn't sexy LOL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo we need therapy? Does HE need solo therapy? I don't even know what this behavior would be called but I'm very open to hearing anyone's opinion on how to help live with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: boyfriend has meltdowns over minor issues and then starts blaming me for weird things in the heat of the moment.",

I'm pretty sure she likes me back because whenever we hang out with our friend group, we will usually play some kind of sport and she always wants to be on my team. Also earlier in the year we were looking at our school pictures and she was complementing mine. Sometimes her comments kinda confuse me though, like the other day we were hanging out in a group and she said something about how theres a lot she doesnt like about me but i have really good taste in music, so I dont know what to make of that. Starting two weeks from now we are getting a new class together and I want to use that to get to know her better and hopefully ask her on a date. I just dont want to make things awkward because the only group of friends she has is my friend group and if she rejects me, I'm probably gonna get made fun of for the rest of the year by them. She already \"dated\" one of the guys in the group but they were together for a few hours until she friendzoned him.\n\nSo how should I go about asking her out?\n\nTL;DR!

        "text": "He told me he wanted to lose weight at the beginning of the year. He wanted to eat chips. I thought chips are not healthy, so I told him it would not be good for him and instead suggested he could eat what remained from my dish yesterday. I have been sick for quite a few days, which is why I could not finish this restaurant dish. I am recovering. He ate everything so like 3/4 of it. Right after, he kept trying to get the chips again, and I explained to him it was not good for his health and I playfully hid it away. He knew where it was. We played jokingly around it and fell asleep.\n\nAfter we woke up, I told him that I needed to go to the bathroom because I felt like vomiting. When I came back, I found him with the pack of chips munching on it.\n\nI told him I did not understand. He said he thought it was a playful thing. I thought it was a playful thing too. I explained to him I cared for his health and I wanted him to grow old with me. And it hurt me he would pick a time where I was vomiting to do that. He said he was hungry. I replied he could have talked to me about it, that I would have discussed it with him. He started to say I am the one causing problems with his diet \"you are the problem, because your cooking is making me gain weight and when you are away, I actually lose weight\".\n\nI have been cooking a lot for him. I have been preparing food he likes and making sure it is of good quality. I explained it is fine he reduces his intake, but it is important he improves the quality of his food.  He lost it \"burgers and McDonald's are healthy\", \"the quality of McDonald's in Austria is way better than elsewhere\", it is healthy, he is better losing weight and managing his diet when I am not there and he was doing better before I came along.\n\nIt broke my heart to hear this. I started crying. He tried to calm me down by rubbing my shoulders. I was angry, I asked him not to touch me. He said he did not mean that, it was simply a statement about his diet and his weight and he could not stand it anymore. I said I would not cook anymore for him. He replied he never asked me to cook. I explained I cared for him and his health and this was why I cooked. He said \"You don't understand. You cook so good, I cannot stop eating and I just gain weight.\" I replied \"It is your problem. Then you should learn to stop.\" I felt so hurt he hated the things that I shared with him. He left for a shower.\n\nWhen he came back, he said he loves me. I lost it, and I told him I could not understand it anymore and that \"I am done with your tricks\". He said: \"What? I told you my feelings and I am tricking you? Why do you always think I am the bad person?\" I was tired of getting so hurt and then hearing \"I love you\" as a way of solving the issue and never really addressing it. He said he really loves me and he was not tricking me, he was tired and done with me always thinking he is a bad person. He said he would go out and buy the rice I need because I was feeling sick and then he would go. At that point I told him no. He insisted on doing it, because (his words) \"I care for you\". I said I changed my mind, I did not feel cared for, and tried to explain that him getting rice for me made me feel dependent on him.\n\nI have a hard time remembering all the details. He went out, bought the rice, came back. I said he does not understand I can change my mind and say no and it felt like he gaslighting the issue. He went on a rant \"Gaslighting? Is that what you said? Why do you always think I am a bad person?\" He kept telling me about how he could not stand my comments anymore. I said I could not stand the pressure anymore of having to be so careful with my words because anything I say might be wrong.\n\nHe said that I was mean and hurtful. That he could not stand it anymore. He left me. I don't know anymore what is our situation. I begged him to come back. I said that I was sorry. I told him that I have really loved him. I feel extremely lonely. I am still pretty sick and all I felt like doing after he left was to cry. I tried to message him saying that I was sorry. I would like some help from him to sort out some belongings tomorrow. I am too weak to do it on my own because I am sick. How can I reach out to him? This is his last text:\n\n\"I really do not see why I should come back. You’re not  even able to honestly apologise for your behaviour. I’ve tried to explain a million times what has been hurting me. I’ve had many fights about this before. This time I feel like you’ve gone too far. \n\nI am under the impression that the only reason for your attempted apology is that you need me. This in itself is hurtful.\n\nI am available for a call tomorrow morning at 10. Please use the time until then to really reflect on everything. A part of me believes that you really do not know how badly you’ve been treating me. This part is getting smaller and smaller. I hope this part is right. The hope is getting smaller and smaller. \n\nDepending on the call tomorrow, I will decide whether or not coming back is worth the risk of being hurt more.\"\n\nTL:DR: Boyfriend is going to break up with him if I cannot figure out a solution soon, help me figure out what is wrong with me.",

Which is completely different to how I’ve felt the the past 6 years we’ve been together. I’ve always liked the idea of marriage and I think it’s a beautiful moment to show your love and commitment to somebody. Just last year I was nonstop thinking of marriage and my boyfriend proposing to me and I’ve brought it up to him multiple times too. But now I’m like…. If he proposed I don’t even know that I’d say yes. Does that mean there’s a deeper issue at hand? Recently I’ve found myself wondering what my life would be like if I was single and alone for a while and it confuses me. I love my boyfriend.. he makes me laugh and holds me when I cry. We have had SO many good moments together. But sometimes I’ll try to make conversation about something random and he’ll act like I’m dumb for it. Or he’ll talk to me in a condescending tone when I say I’m uncomfortable by something that doesn’t personally bother him. There’s times where I’m upset and he doesn’t even try to figure out what’s wrong.. just gives up and goes on his computer. (I do know it’s important I speak up too. It’s very hard for me sometimes tho). There’s been times where if I’m upset by something he did he will make it about himself. We also live together and I get annoyed by how he rarely thinks to clean the apartment on his own. It’s almost always me cleaning on my days off. And y’know.. I’m not innocent either.. I have my own issues to work out and I’ve been unintentionally toxic. And I know relationships have their ups and downs and it’s not realistic to constantly be happy with each other. But recently, I’ve been thinking of a life without having to worry about another human being. What it would be like to move back in with my parents and figure myself out and work on my issues alone. Sometimes I just feel like we are growing apart.. and that scares me because I’ve been with him since I was 16. I don’t even know if I want advice but I just wanted to let this out… But hey, if you have stuff you’d like to share then feel free. \n\nTL;DR I don’t feel interest in marrying my long term partner anymore and I feel like I’m growing apart from him",

        "text": "Our dad just died in the fall (he raised us as a single dad). During his illness, my brother often left the bulk of the burden on me to deal with even though I live further away. It caused me a great deal of stress and resentment, but my brother was always busy helping his wife (Denise) who had a lot of issues (schizophrenia, often non-compliant in taking her medications). My brother and Denise had a very weirdly co-dependent relationship. I often thought it was border-line abusive (on Denise's part -- she was prone to having meltdowns and she was pretty controlling), but he always maintained she was his soulmate and he would do anything for her. And he did. I was often annoyed with both of them. She didn't work due to her medical issues but she was a shopaholic and a hoarder, and they were in serious debt (often he would need to borrow money to make it through the end of the month).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, after our dad died, he did step up more in helping deal with cleaning out dad's house, etc. And then unexpectedly Denise died 8 weeks ago which came as a total shock. My brother was grieving deeply and I went to stay with him for a bit and help him get things in order (we barely put a dent in things....I was pretty shocked at what chaos his life was in).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the part I'm struggling with: within WEEKS (I'm not exaggerating) he has told me he met another woman. It's just online so far, but they talk for hours over video every night, and they are going to meet up next weekend (for the entire weekend). Denise (his \"soulmate\") died 8 weeks ago. And not after a lengthy illness....just out of the blue. And 3 weeks later he was spending hours every day talking to another woman. He's told me they average about 4 - 6 hours of talking a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried many times to talk to him. To tell him to please give himself room to grieve. To seek counselling to deal with this loss. To take things slowly. He just is adamant that it is \"destiny\" that brought this woman to him in his hour of need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really concerned about him. He won't stop talking about this woman (it's \"Lisa this\" and \"Lisa that\"). And he has a 12 year old daughter from a previous relationship who he has 1/2 custody of, and he told me that he plans on having her meet this new woman very soon. And when his daughter is with him, he's spending hours talking to Lisa on the phone or online. And I'm really doubting Lisa can be \"normal\" given that she knows Denise died just shy of 2 months ago. She can't be wanting him for money or anything (he definitely doesn't have much of that) so I can't figure out where the scam could be. She has a job and she is a citizen of our country. I'm really confused by it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it normal to move on this quickly? Doesn't it seem insanely fast? Denise's stuff is still everywhere in the house and he thinks this new woman is going to just come on over and meet his poor daughter. Extended family members keep reaching out to me to check in on him (since Denise just died) thinking he must be in deep grief, but meantime he's fully infatuated with some woman he's never met in person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any possibility this could be \"ok\"? Is there any possibility Lisa might actually be a normal person and they could work out? Or am I correct in thinking this has disaster written all over it??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: my brother isn't properly grieving his wife and has immediately jumped into a weird new relationship",

        "text": "So my boyfriend (40) and I (F23) have been together for almost three years. We're both very adventurous and spoke early about opening things up. However we have only just begun adding in partners.  \nI have had one experience with him watching, and one other failed attempt. He was supposed to meet a girl alone before this, but we got into a fight (I was just starting my period and it ended up being really bad timing, I was too emotional in general), and the second girl was for a threesome. She ticked all the physical boxes, but we had a ft and I didn't gravitate to her, although I was still open to doing it.  \nI don't know if this is an issue though? Do i need to like the girl particulary? I don't always need to like the man im playing with...  \nI spoke to my boyfriend about this, but he was really ready to shut it down. He is worried I will feel bad etc. which I totally understand, but I think on some level I just need a bit of a push to get going (I had some concerns before we did things the other way around too).  \nI also feel like maybe he's not saying how he feels incase he hurts me, he's very sensitive to my feelings, but I also want to make sure he's happy!  \nHis conclusion that night was that we wasn't being open anymore, and he said he wanted to close the relationship. Since, we have discussed that we could do things in a more organic manor, and sort of not put much emphasis on it for now...  \nThis was good for me, and a few days later I deleted the chat messages I had with the other guy wee successfully saw.  \nIm very curious about playing with other girls, and open to anything my partner wants to indulge in. However I feel really bad that I have not been into the most recent girl and the timing issue with the girl before. I feel like im letting him down and not being a good partner. I want him to be happy and enjoy himself, that gives me joy (and turns me on)! And we haven't had any of these kinds of issues with him, although he did say with some of the male options I had that he wasn't interested in them, but it was before a ft call etc.\n\nToday he asked me if I still had the guys number and if I wanted to message him. I said I didn't, but I could find it if he wanted to still do this. He said he would like to if I would. I did enjoy what we did together, but it wasn't a massively significant point in my life. My conclusion was that it was just a different sexual experience, I thought it would feel more... naughty/ bad? I'm happy in my relationship, and I enjoy that my partner gets something out of this dynamic. I do too, I mean its just sex for me, that my partner gets a lot out of. But I'm not sure why he wants to keep doing this when he was quite adamant about closing the relationship up (I never said it). I think nows a good time to mention that the focus was on me sleeping with other men in the first place. He was interested in that and I was too, however he felt that it would be unbalanced if he wasn't able to too (which I was totally fine with and curious about). It was all a very exciting fantasy at first.  \nSo is it fair to conclude he enjoys this mostly?\n\nSO heres a few summary questions\n\n\\- Do I need to really like the girl?  \nWhat I've learnt from this is that its a different game for men and women.  \nIm a girl that doesn't need connection for sex and some men dont either (i dont want to generalise), so the process of hooking up is quite straight forward.  \nIm not huge into texting these men, so again it's not massively a thing in regards to connecting.  \nA little bit of sexting and photos sporadically. My boyfriend LOVES this btw... It turns him on a lot!\n\nFor him it seems to have been quite different.  \nHe likes to connect (in general), and it seems that most girls like to have a bit of connection too. So he has been building up these connections, chatting more regularly.  \nThe girl we FT he wanted to pick up and have drinks first... but in some ways i see this being part of his communication style? And this girl seemed to be like that herself. She was also very into me and exploring her bi side.  \nI saw their messages and was totally fine with this, but I just didn't gravitate to her on the call. I don't think we'd be friends in real life, but that would be the same with some men ive been with, so does it really matter? Plus I was happy to go forward, he wasn't.  \nI think he wanted me to be more friendly with the girl, which made sense, but I didn't expect it from him. Again different dynamic though, right?\n\n\\- Should I push him to explore with girls a little more?  \nI really discussed with him after that I still want to do it, im really curious, but he seemed to have made his decision.  \nIt's almost as though, because I don't get the same thing out of it he isnt happy. I think thats a little unreasonable, as its not exactly the same thing. Do I just need to be a little more accommodating and encouraging, so he feels good about doing it? I dont want it to be the things im doing/ saying thats making him feel bad.  \nIm super curious about doing it and I think it could be a lot of fun.  \nOr do you think that maybe he's much more into the other stuff and not really into this as much, but just wants to keep it even. He said himself it's a lot of work with girls. He feels he has to host and keep everyone happy. That is feeling a little stressful for him.\n\nOpen relationships are hard... they require a lot of communication lol! Any insight would be great x  \n\n\nTL;DR!- should I encourage bf to have a threesome or does he prefer sharing me?",

        "text": "Hi all, \nI (21M) recently started dating my lesbian best friend (20F) who confessed to me about a week ago while we were drunk. Up until recently I was under the impression that she was only interested in women but after several drinks she admitted to still having feelings for me. We previously dated 4 years ago in while we were high school for about 11 months. We broke up because she was questioning her sexuality and wasn’t attracted to me anymore. After the recent confession I said that I still had feelings for her as well, as I have thought about her off and on for the better part of the 4 years we were best friends. But now I feel like I fear losing her as my best friend if this relationship doesn’t work out which makes me not want to continue the romantic relationship and go back to having her as my best friend who I can rely on completely. She has stated that if this relationship were to not work out in the long run there is no way we would continue to be best friends as it would be too painful. What should I do?   \n\ntl;dr I’m (21M) dating my ex (20F) from high school who also happens to be my best friend, and who I thought was lesbian, and I fear losing her as my friend if this relationship doesn’t work out and it’s making me question if I should see if we can go back to friends before anything gets too serious. What should I do?",

        "text": "Hey,  I'm a bit lost here and I need some advice. So, my long distance  girlfriend and I have been together for 4 months now and everything was  going great until recently. We were having a conversation about our  relationship, and I brought up some concerns I had about our  communication and the distance between us. After that conversation, we  decided to take a break and give each other some space to think.\n\nTwo  days later, she reaches out to me and tells me that she misses me,  which I was really happy to hear. But then she drops a bomb on me - she  tells me that she's developed feelings for someone else. She says that  she still wants to be with me and that she would never date 2 people at  the same time, but she can't help how she feels. She says that she likes  this person because they can see each other in real life, whereas our  relationship is only online.\n\nI was  absolutely devastated when she told me this. It feels like everything  we had built together was suddenly shattered. I don't know what to do or  how to feel. On the one hand, I still love her and want to be with her,  but on the other hand, I feel betrayed and hurt. I don't know if I can  trust her anymore.\n\nWhat do you all  think? Should I try to work things out with her, or should I move on?  Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I just need some advice on  how to move forward from this.  \n\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : Long distance relationship girlfriend likes someone else but only wants me",

        "text": "So I(27 M) met this girl(27 F) on hinge about a month ago, she matched with me and messaged me first, we went back and forth a little bit over like a week until she gave me her number. I noticed we had the same area code which is super weird since I was raised in a very small area super far away. Apparently she grew up in a small town about an hour from me and we are basically the exact same age(only 12 days apart) and I thought that was super cool. It was February 14th so I asked if she had any plans for Valentine’s Day and she said she was free, so I called a lot of places in the area to book a last minute reservation and managed to find 1 place for dinner. It was the first time I was super excited to go on a date in years and I think I came off as nervous. I drove her back home and she said she had a great time and wanted to see me again!\n\nI told her that I had friends coming in town for the following 2 weeks and wouldn’t be able to talk much or see her again for a bit and she seemed okay with it and said she wanted to hang out after. Now they have left and we planned to go to some art museums in town that I mentioned I’ve been wanting to go to. She seemed excited to go, however the day before we planned to go she mentioned she couldn’t go due to her family being in the town 2 hours away and going to see them. She set up the re-schedule and we’re set to go the next week.\n\nI’ve noticed she doesn’t text much at all, like I’ll send her something and she’ll always respond very enthusiastically and thoughtfully. Like, if it took her a long time to respond she’ll explain why it took her awhile, but it usually ends there. I’ll send something else but she’ll never respond to that. Our second date was scheduled for tomorrow but now I feel like I am in my own head over her not responding and I’m assuming things are over. \n\nI wasn’t able to text at all this past week due to working late every night and falling asleep when I got home. But my manager gave me off yesterday to thank me staying late, so I just sent her a happy Friday text since it was awhile since I talked to her last and asked if she could get back to me what time would work best for her for our date, she didn’t text me at all the whole day and I started worrying. However that night my dog got really sick and I had to rush him to the ER where I was with him till about 3am :(. We got back home and when I woke up the next day I was still stressed from the night before that I let my anxiety get the best of me and sent another text just asking if picking her up at noon the next day would be alright. No response again. I also had other plans later on tonight and I wouldn’t be around my phone, so I was hoping to just get it figured out before I left since it would’ve been a pain otherwise. \n\nIt was starting to get a little close to time to leave and she still hadn’t gotten back. Now I normally am fine with not getting a response because I know people are busy, But I think a mixture of all my anxiety from this, My work, and my dog the past week just kinda came to a head and I decided to just try to call her since it would’ve just put my mind at ease to have the time figured out and when I will need to start getting ready to pick her up. She sent me to voicemail and I just left a short message basically just briefly saying how I haven’t been talking much because of work and the situation with my dog and how I wouldn’t be at my phone the rest of the night, so I was just checking what time worked for her. I said how I’m still excited to go and to just shoot me a text or call whenever she can and left it at that. I stopped back home just now for like an hour and looked and she still hasn’t gotten back and Im starting to think I messed it up. \n\nI understand that she still could get back to me, But I still feel like I may have overwhelmed her a bit with the amount I was following up and scared her off, which kinda makes me sad. I was really excited to see her again but I just let my anxiety get the best of me. I go to therapy for it for over a year now and have been able to develop a lot of coping strategies to help alleviate my anxiety in times of stress and they’ve been really helpful and I’ve noticed them working! But now I just kinda forgot all of them from the super high stress and double texted and called afterwards. Im curious what you all think though! Was I coming off too strong and being too pushy? Ive always advocated to my female friends that if they are very uncomfortable from a guy on a dating app that they shouldn’t feel guilty to ghost them, and while I understand its an irrational thought I still somewhat feel like I might be that creepy guy :(\n\nTL;DR I met a girl I was actually excited to see again for the first time in awhile. I had a really rough week and let my anxiety get the best of me and double text and call her to get details on a date the next day. I feel like I scared her away from because of this and wanted to know if other people thought I was being too pushy since this is something I’m working on a lot.",

        "text": "Background: My best friend and I (both mid-20s) have known each other for about 1.5 years. We get along great and she's someone I truly click with on a level that I haven't experienced before. For the first year we knew each other, I was in a committed long-term relationship so our friendship was entirely platonic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat all changed when I broke up with my ex. Since then, my best friend has made passes at me while drunk twice and I've reciprocated. We've made out a few times and cuddled, but nothing more than that (at my insistence since I was recently single and didn't want a potential rebound situation to occur). However, each time this happened, the following day she would tell me that she thinks we should just be friends and that she's afraid of jeopardizing our friendship and potentially ruining the dynamic our shared friend group. While this was upsetting to hear, since I do like her, we talked things out and I was actually ok with just remaining friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUs just being friends continued for a few weeks, with us still hanging out one-on-one and in group settings regularly, and things seemed to go back to normal. I even started moving on from the whole thing about a week ago and have begun getting ready to start dating again. However, last night we were drinking in a group setting and she was being extremely touchy and affectionate towards me, to the point that I'm sure other people in the group noticed. I'm not an idiot and could tell she clearly wanted to talk about something, so later that night when we were alone we talked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGist of the conversation is that she confessed she really does like me, more than a typical crush, and that she thinks she made a mistake and wants to try progressing our friendship to being more than friends. I'm feeling torn because while I really like her as person and am attracted to her, I also feel like I just started moving on from her and that I'm not as infatuated with her as I was a few weeks ago. Also, as cliche as it sounds, she's the first person I've known where I truly do feel scared about 'risking' our friendship if things don't work out. But at the same time, I know that it's rare to come across someone that you click with so well and are also attracted to, so my mind is all jumbled up. I asked her why she changed her mind (again), and she said that even though she's scared, she realized that she's just been giving herself excuses not to pursue a relationship and that seeing me in a new relationship with someone other than her would be upsetting and she wants to see if we can work. I told her that I need to think about things and that we need to revisit this conversation while sober, given that we've now had this same conversation 3 times when under the influence and each time she changed her mind again the following day. That said, it did feel different last night... it felt like she truly does feel differently than before and that the ball is in my court on if this happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences as me, and if they think it's a good idea to pursue a relationship with your best friend (especially with all the wishy-washiness going on). I really haven't made up my mind about this, so any insight/advice would be appreciated!\n\ntl;dr Best friend has confessed her feelings for me multiple times while drunk but keeps changing her mind the next day. Did it again last night, but it feels different this time and like she really does want it, but I'm feeling conflicted. Looking for advice.",

When I left I had a very immature mentality and thought I wasn’t being treated how I should have been by my friends. My best friend (14f 12 at the time) since kindergarten on again off again relationship, didn’t know about any of my struggles or my “mentality” and now I realize I should have talked to her before hand. Anyways I was away from public socials for 2 years. I had left my best friend dry for 2 years. I had started to really worry about her for awhile but I didn’t know how to approach her. In February of 2022 I got her number off my moms phone and tried to apologize and accept my blame. It was a pretty bad apology and she rejected me. I now almost a year later have matured enough to know I had a victim mentality and really want to be apart of her life again. I really have changed and matured started taking care of myself but since my last apology I don’t know what to do. Do I contact her, do I try to meet her in public, Do I let her go? I really want to make it work but I think she just can’t let me. I really love her as a friend and am ready for life. Please I need some advice. \n\nTL:DR I left public socials for mental reasons and hurt my best friend doing it. I came back a year later to apologize to her (very badly regrettably) and be a better friend. She turned me down.

Do I contact her, talk to her in public, or let her be? Any advice is helpful.",

Fast forward to this morning, he texted me saying he was hungover and didn’t want to do anything but lay in bed, he said preferably my bed. I told him I’d pick him up and he can sleep at my place because he lives with his brothers and I live by myself and his brothers can be noisy. He then told me he was just too tired to get up so he just FaceTimed me for a couple hours while I packed for my upcoming trip. \n\nAnyway, after facetime he took a nap and then he just texted me that he’s going out with his brothers to the bar they like.

        "text": "Me (29F) and my gf (30F) have been dating for half a year. We are from different countries and cultures, so we had to figure out some things, but I love her dearly with all her uniqueness. We had some arguments over small issues which turned into major fights. We could always overcome them eventually with reflective communication. She is mostly rational while I’m emotional. When I need to cry, I cry even if there are people around. When I laugh, I do it wholeheartedly. I believe in self-expression and assertive communication. On the other hand, my partner is afraid to show feelings and always cautious of how others view her. She hardly shares her emotions, but when she can, she would share her deepest thoughts and we would have wonderful and meaningful conversations.\nTwo weeks ago I left my job and it affected me tremendously since I was working with toddlers 8 hours a day and we all formed strong connections. It was such a sudden leave I couldn’t properly say goodbye but I needed to leave ASAP for my own mental health (toxic workplace). With quitting came the realisation that I also need to move back to my family’s house until I find something steady. She was by my side the whole time to support me even though she said she was not good in comforting others. I was so thankful and I told her that I’m drained mentally and vulnerable so I also can’t offer much.\n2 week passed and today I moved. We had some misunderstandings during the daytime due to stress but I tried to brush it off. She was loving and caring with my family, but scolded and degraded me with remarks constantly or just completely ignored me. After we went to sleep I tried to talk to her about the situation but she refused. I told her I couldn’t go on with the ignorance and her behaviour so I would like to have a conversation and work on our relationship. Then she informed me that she gave up some time ago to mend our bonds and that’s why she didn’t care if she hurt me. I started to cry and asked her if she really meant it. She laughed (I think it’s a nervous reaction) and said yes. I faced her and asked her if she loved me. She said no. That was the point I couldn’t hold it anymore and started to cry loudly. The tears just came and I couldn’t stop my loud sobs. She covered my mouth with her hands and told me to not to make a scene while my family was around. I tried but I couldn’t. All the tears and pain I had inside me from the past months and recent events came out in muffled screams and cries. My mom got scared and rushed to my room if we were okay. She tried to calm me and left after some minutes. Then my partner looked at me and said she has never felt this ashamed in her life before. I told her my mom was just worried because previously I had similar panic attacks in my adolescent years but she said it was over as soon as my mom stepped into my room. I was dumbfounded. I told her I was sorry but she said she didn’t care. She told me I was an asshole for not considering that my family could hear us. I tried to calm myself in the restroom and when I went back she told me we could sleep next to each other but as soon as we woke up she would go home. She deleted and blocked me everywhere during the nighttime which I didn’t notice for a while.\nI know I can be too much sometimes, even overly emotional with the people I feel comfortable with so I regularly go to therapy to work on myself. In this situation though I’m lost.\nCan you guys help me understand how a rational thinker and emotional person work together in a relationship?\n\nTL;DR We had some rough weeks with my partner and she told me she lost all feelings for me and doesn’t love me anymore so I started to cry loudly from pent-up emotions that my mom needed to check on us in my room which made her so ashamed that she broke up with me.",

        "text": " We're  both adults - me (26F) and them (19N) are also both students, who'll graduate around similar time. Big age gaps at that age are a matter of life experience right? Honestly I think they have more of that, as I never dated and they have few exes. They have also more friends than I do, hang out more with them, and are way more like me rn than me from 7 years ago. We're currently online friends that knew each other since like a year, but recently (about.. 2 months ago?) we got closer, really clicked and spend entire days on the phone calls.\n\nIs it creepy for me to pursue them? We might not even meet irl ever tbh. I'm fine with that. They're also polyamorous, and if they wanted to date more people, I won't stop them.\n\ntl;dr - 19 and 26 yo but the life experience is comparable and there's no power imbalance involved",

        "text": "Hey everyone! For context, we've been seeing my bf for about 3 months now, in a relationship officially for a month. We live about 2 hours from each other. We're both in Australia so days may be a bit off for some.\n\nMe and my bf have a routine of me visiting him one weekend and him visiting the next. Everytime I go to visit him, it goes fine, but everything he's supposed to come see me, there's an excuse. He slept in too late, he didn't sleep at all, he feels sick, it's too hot etc. He ends up cancelling last minute after I've cleaned the whole house but always reschedules for the next day and does come over.\n\nThis weekend, I was meant to go see him on Saturday, but he cancelled Friday night because he wanted time alone to rest and recharge his social battery after a long work week. I was fine with that. Then at 5pm on Saturday, he messaged me to say he was going to a party. I was a bit upset because I mean, if your social battery is so drained, why go to a very social place?\n\nAnyway I wasn't too bothered until this morning when I was half way there into a two hours trip and he cancelled. He told me he was too hungover. He promised me last night he would see me today. I got ready and woke up early because we agreed to meet in the morning.\n\nHe gets sick a lot which he can't help, but I also get sick a lot as a chronic migraine sufferer and I still message AS SOON as I feel sick, not last minute. My friends all tell me to be understanding of him being sick, especially since the relationship is perfect besides this, but I just find this rude and unfair.\n\nI feel he has 0 respect for my time. Even if he reschedules and what not, he always confirms it the night before and then ends up cancelling last minute. It's extremely frustrating and I want to be understanding but it's hard.\n\nTL:DR bf always flakes last minute but reschedules for the next day when he's supposed to see me. i was supposed to come see him today, but he cancelled while i was half way there bc he was hungover. he gets sick a lot and friends tell me to be understanding, but im frustrated",
