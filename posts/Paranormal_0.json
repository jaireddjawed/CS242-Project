I was a bit skeptical at first but one night I was in the bathroom washing my face and I felt like someone is behind me and I turned back after that I told him not to take a leak in there go to the toilet and after a while when I came back i saw him and I asked when did you come back from there and he said he didn't even go there he was with my room mates and I went ahead and every one confirmed that. After a few hour passed like it was around 11pm and we all heard chuckles and banging in our window and running in corridor and we used to live at the top floor(5th floor) and since that night I question that if it was hallucinations or how do they exist.",

        "text": "It’s 3:43am in Tempe. My friend and I often like to explore parks late at night/early in the morning. Tonight, we went to Papago park. From the moment we arrived, there was a car parked but no one in the car. We thought maybe somebody was sleeping but upon quickly glancing, we didn’t see anybody so we went to the park. From the moment we stepped out of the car, I saw a tall, lanky, humanoid looking.. something. I thought it was a person, but after blinking it disappeared. My friend then saw the same figure, except black, a short distance from where I had spotted it. We figured our minds were just playing with us so we went and decided to swing. The whole time we heard rustling around us. She started to get nervous, so we started walking back to my car. I could see a small black figure pacing quickly, almost running, back and forth between the trees..We were talking about it amongst ourselves, when the car alarm went off. We booked it for my car and got in. As we drove away, there was still no sight of any actual person in the car or park. I went the wrong direction when we started leaving so I had to do a U-turn and as I drove away we could see the figure again pacing between trees. We were so freaked out that we stopped at a gas station, where I’m writing this, to Google what it could’ve been. Does anybody have any clue what we may have seen tonight????",

        "text": "So let me start by saying that my brother and I are extremely experienced desert campers and we have lived near deserts pretty much our whole lives. I have never in my 20 years of life ever for one second believed in anything paranormal or anything to do with evil spirits, unlike my brother who has always sensed presenses and been able to see mostly what we call djinn also know as demons, until last night which is safe to mark as the last time we will be camping alone jn the desert. We always have the same place we like to go when we want to camp with minimum effort and our day started as normal as ever but as we got closer and closer to our destination I saw my brother's mood completely shift aand when I asked what was wrong he just shrugged me off and told me to just keep driving. When we arrived I felt completely fine but my brother was still unusually quiet (it was around 1pm at that point and we were planning on leaving at around 12-1 am. Because of the heat we made the terrible decision to setup unnder a few trees and a source of water,, which in Middle Eastern culture is where the djinns live at night, not that I believed that at the time of course) however we still setup our camp and continued on as normal. Now my brother always says that when he feels a presence (or several in this case) he gets extremely unlucky... First he almost dropped a box of coals on his foot, then he spilt an entire bottle of coke on his phone, then he dropped it into the sand then proceeded to smash his elbow on the edge if the chair he was sitting on (which is now very swollen) and last but certainly not least when he was looking through one of our boxes he felt something cold and sharp press right against his arm and he realised it was an unsheathed knife (which we packed with its case the previous night before and he later said it felt like something pushed his hand into it, right were his veins are). All of these events consecutively within a matter of a few hours was certainly making us both uneasy and I for the life of me couldn't figure out why he was suddenly so unlucky but as I was staring to question his clumsyness a random couple appeared out of nowhere informing us that they were stuck in the sand an needed help (we drive a land cruiser and they had a Nissan Altima so we didn't expect to encounter as many issues as we did). We first dug them out without any issues but as we pushed them out of the sand but the got stuck again. If you know anything about dune bashing or desert camping then you understand the physics behind how wheels get stuck in sand and the way this nissan was stuck was incredibly unusual, it was literally stuck somewhere with plenty of space available for grip (and later in my brother said that as we were digging them out of the sand, thats when he really started feeling an evil presence around us but didn't want to say anything as to not ruin the trip and freak me out) so we ended up having to tow them out of the sand, which again was far harder than it had to be, first our tow strap broke off of their bumber (toe strap cost 200 dollars and was fine but their bumper was slightly damaged) then we almost got stuck ourselves and a 20 minute job took more like 90 (which again was extremely unusual and with hindsight just the beginning of all the crap to come). When we came back to our camp we noticed how everything around us had gotten unusually quiet, the area we were in has hundreds of birds around and as far as we have seen 3 cats who sometimes pay us a visit, but there wasn't a single noise at all other than our fire. It gad gotten dark quickly so we had scrambled to build a fire to cook our dinner before we were asked to help the couple and I had noticed the silence but it didn't bother me however my brother suddenly grabbed my hand as we were sitting down to eat and said with clear fear in his voice that was should go as quickly as possible and that he didn't feel safe, to ease both our minds we prayed (we are Christian so of course we thought it would help us) but I think it accelerated everything that happened and just made whatever was there with us angry. We quickly finished our dinner (and me being the skeptic I was completely fine and pretty much just humouring my brother) util I started getting the nagging feeling that it was time to pack up and leave, it hit me like a wave and I was quite taken a back by the feeling so I voiced it to my brother and he agreed that we should pack up right away and leave. We started packing up (at a normal pace like we were just tired and wanted to leave) and that when we heard a sound very close to us, on the opposite side of the pond which wasn't that big, that I could only describe as the sound of death itself and it seemed to go on for several minutes and when I say that we looked at each other in absolute fear I genuinely mean I was ready to have a heart attack right there and then. At that point, after being forzen for a few minutes and quite reasonably so after hearing that bellowing screech so close to us, we turned on the car, drove it back so we could see better with the headlamps and just started throwing everything into the car without much care but with a whole lot of urgency...and it was like after the screaming thats when shit really hit the fan. First it was the sound of twigs snapping and footsteps all around us, then it was the shadows behind the trees and I tried everything to try and get those shadows to change shape, walking around the trees and moving the lights but nothing it looked like there were people just staring at us the whole time and you could really feel it too, we really felt like we weren't alone and that we weren't with friendly entities either. We also noticed that all 3 cats were huddled  right behind our car (away from the trees so they were not the ones snapping twigs) but literally did not care if they were not going to move I was still getting out if there (thankfully they left when we started reversing) but they too looked absolutely terrified and were just starting at the trees too. It also felt like whatever was there was getting closer (and I have never felt anything like it, it was a gut feeling and you just know its one of those natural instinct you should not ignore). Thankfully we were able to pack up quickly (our tent was very close to the trees though so that was a nerve wracking experience) and whilst we are packing it is still very silent (its very normal for the birds around that area to continue making sounds until 2 or 3 am) and at this point it was about 8pm so it was highly unusual. I personally think I was most terrifying as I was driving away back onto the main dirt path to leave the desert (I know cars very well, I know how they drive in the sand and I know our car especially well because weve had it for so long and I could instantly tell that the steering was off and  completely fighting against me which fixed itself the second we were on the highway) , the sound of twigs snapping was still all around us and it was loud enough to be heard over the sounds of the car and on the path was what seemed like every bird that was in the area, just standing there and staring at us until we got close enough to force them to walk (not even fly) away. At one point my brother just grabbed me shoulder and told me very sternly to just keep looking in front of me and under no circumstances to look through his window (it was the tone of his voice that told me to listen to him for the love of god). We were in a part of the desert where we had to pretty much drive through the whole of the accessible areas to get onto the highway and there wasn't a single person around us, the only thing we saw was a very clearly abandoned toyota hylux positioned behind a small dune and hidden by the trees but was far enough from our campsite to easily be ruled out as the source of the original screech. The worst thing I saw was as we were closing to the exit (now we know these deserts very well, we've both grown up here and have been riding dirt bikes and quad bikes in these deserts since we moved here and we know what wild life to expect, cats, birds, spiders, goats, camels, mice, foxes maybe even the occasional scorpio or if you are really unlucky a snake but that is it, there is nothing else in these deserts) we saw standing in the middle of the path, staring directly at us, a deer...a god damn deer (Ive only ever seen 1 deer in 16 hears of living here and that was in someone's garden as a pet). Its safe to say I was in complete shock, and the deer was just not moving at all until I got close enough that we could practically smell the thing before it slowly walked off the path whilst looking right at us. We quickly moved past the deer and again my brother, with a gasp and then very sternly, said to keep my eyes right in the road (I asked him as we got on the highway what it was that he kept seeing and he very reluctantly told me he kept seeing large figures around us anytime we went through a bend and they were all either pointing right as us or ahead of us...Im very glad he didn't tell me at the time cus I would have been shitting mysel). We still were yet to encounter anyone but we still very clearly heard sounds all around us (and again not the usual bird or cat but very clearly big and unrelenting). When I saw the exit I was as happy as I have ever been but that quickly fade when once again we saw another deer standing right in the middle of the road slowly waking away and looking right at us except this time it didn't really look like a deer more like a kangaroo mixed with a deer and its eyes were milky and it looked rotten and horrible, but I didn't much care I just stepped on the gas and fortunately it had gotten out if the way in time. Now when you exit the desert you can either turn right onto a long stretch of highway or you can go left and go through a small town then take the back streets to a parallel highway and as I was about to turn right my brother once again, with that same tone if voice, said to go to the town and go to the right (later he once again said he saw a line of figures pointing ahead of us so if we would have gone that way we wouldn't have made it home in one piece). Thankfully as we made it farther and farther awayy and close to our home the gut feeling of being watched was going away and of course having never experienced something like this before I was distraught and wanted to talk about it. My brother told me as we were going home that because we were alone the djinn wanted to mess with us, that they wanted to scare us and most likely cause us harm and that the way they get to you in such rural places is to force you to stop and then do whatever they want (which make sense as to why there were so many animals on our path). He also said that they cause bad luck and he could feel them the second we entered the desert (which explains his clumsyness all day and the car that got stuck in such an unusual manner). This is also my younger brother (by 3 years) and naturally any time he ever told me about this sort of thing I always just dismissed it as him scaring himself... I can excuse the sounds we heard and shadows we saw last night, I can excuse the gut feeling as just being scared but I cannot excuse the 2 deer we saw staring right at us and I cannot excuse the car just randomly fighting against me as I was driving. The deer completely freaked me out as did the tone of my brother's voice (Im also sorry if this us written sporadically, Im still shaken up and trying to make sense of everything) and its safe to say we are not going camping there again and its safe to say Im never dismissing my brother when jt comes to this kind if thing again and god am I so thankful that we made it home safely.",

        "text": "Last night, I gently woke from a deep sleep. I was sleeping on my back with my left cheek was on the pillow. I opened my eyes and turned my head slowly to the right and was met with a blonde-haired woman peering directly down at me and just behind her shoulder was a dark-haired, mustachioed man. They both had puzzled looks on their faces, almost as though they were confused to find me in the bed. I blinked my eyes, and then watched them spiral/swirl into nothing, something like you would see in in a cartoon (it feels incredibly silly to describe it this way, but that is exactly what I saw). \n\nThe woman was wearing a red long-sleeve, high-necked dress, and the man was wearing a dark suit - both fitting of the characteristics of the clothing style of the late 1800s/early 1900s.\n\nI didn’t feel scared or threatened, but I did have a hard time going back to sleep and haven’t been able to get their images out of my mind since. \n\nI asked my landlady if anyone has ever mentioned any encounters in my place. She said the only thing she is aware of is the ghost her uncle named George that “lives” in what is now her house, next door to my place. She said she’s never seen George herself though.\n\nWe live in a tiny, fairly rural town where the Great Northern runs through. Being relatively new to the area, I don’t know much about the town’s history, so I put my online detectiving to the test and learned that my house is about a half mile from where the “red light district” was located at the turn of the century. \n\nI’m not freaked out and don’t feel uneasy in my place, but it will be interesting to see if they come back.",

The emf was spiking and after a few seconds of moving it away and moving it closer again, the spirit box said “don’t”. So I stopped and apologized. \n\nI spoke to the spirit of the doll while driving letting the spirit know that it was in good hands now along with some just other things. Kinda like talking to a friend. \n\nNow once we got home and I placed her where I have. I decided to leave her for a bit to get accustomed.\n\nUpon returning. I decided to do another emf/spirit box check to see if I had any better luck at this point. I’m short so wasn’t holding it very high up. \n\nSpirit box said “higher”. I raised it higher and then the box asked “what do you want me to do?”. The spirit for some reason was making the meter of the emf actually bottom out instead of spike. So I requested it to please make the meter go the other way and it did. \n\nThen the box asked “am I dead”, I said yes and proceeded to asked for its name. It said “soon” and then all activity just stopped. Almost like it was in shock in finding out it was dead and needed time to process it. \n\nAnyways though, I just wanted to share this with you guys cause it was just an incredible experience to have happen. \n\nI can post a picture of her if anyone would like to see her, just let me know.",

        "text": "When I was around 9 years old my friend and me were playing outside our school. There was an event going on and it already got dark outside. We ran around and to understand what happened next you need to understand the layout of the school yard. \n\nIt was a big square yard with high bushes opposite of the school walls. It was just a straight line were kids would run and hide. There was space for about 2 people standing next to each other between the bushes and a fence to a pavement. Every 10 meters or so there was an opening into this space between bush and fence. \n\nSo my friend and me are running around and then disappear into the bushes laughing. We walked behind the bushes, like I said only a straight line was possible behind the bushes, kinda stopped and looked straight ahead. There was a bus stop, the one I used for 8 years when I became 10. It was about 15-20meters away from us. There was a woman. Looking straight ahead, but we only saw her right side profile. She had a white dress on.  I couldn’t see any feet, she just hovered there. I didn’t see any features, she was more like a smudge. And that’s what I thought it was, just my eyed playing tricks on me. Until I looked at my friend staring also at her. We both kinda looked at each other confused. And then, scaring the life out of me, this „smudge“ turned her head around, looked at us and came closer at an alarming speed. We both screamed and ran outside the bushes to the middle of yard, trying to catch our breath. I asked her what she saw, thinking maybe I just startled her and caused her to scream because I screamed. To my horror she described the same thing I saw. Us being stupid 9 year olds we started laughing. Me being always the one stirring things up, I suggested going back and checking out if she was still there. My laughing stopped when I went behind the bushes and spotted her standing and the bus stop again. And yet again, she slowly looked at us and came closer. This time we screamed and ran back inside the school to out parents. I remember not telling anyone anything because I knew they wouldn’t believe me. I’ve only told this story to a handful of people. I lost contact with this friend but I wish I could talk to her and ask her if she remembers this day as clearly as I do.",

I was about 7 months pregnant with my first child at the time...I'll post almost verbatim what I shared originally, minus location details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"\"The girl's restroom at the Home Depot is totally haunted! When we got there, I had to use the restroom right away. I know I was the only one in there because I used the very last stall, and all the others had their doors open. As I'm sitting, I think I hear what sounds like a little girl whimper. I stop and listen, but think I must've just imagined it. A moment later I hear what sounds like the same voice/tone make a sigh. So I'm all, 'Yup, not gonna tempt anything. Time to go.'\n\nI flush and walk the long gauntlet past the 9 or so other stalls back to the front towards the sinks. Just as I put soap on my hand one of the toilets flushed on its own! They're not motion sensored. They're the newer push button toilets. Needless to say, I rushed out of there rather quickly. Once out I tell my husband, \"That bathroom's haunted\" and tell him what I experienced and he's all, \"You found Moaning Myrtle!\"\n\nBut wait, it gets better. So, we're buying paint and while waiting for it to mix we were chatting with the girl working the paint counter and I tell her about the possible ghost and she's all, \"Oh yeah, this place is haunted. There used to be a guy who worked here and told me that all the time, but I thought he was just making it up because he was a prankster, but then our manger, who's very serious and never jokes around, also told me it's haunted.\" She goes on to tell us that there's a school behind them, which some say is haunted and there used to be a cemetery nearby where a bunch of kids were buried at. The cemetery was relocated, but many believe some of the bodies were left behind.\"\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, that was a fun little experience. I like to be skeptical of all stories being told, even from myself. At the time I was very \"yes, this happened!\" but I look back and think it may have just been pregnancy hormones making me excitable. However, I did hear those noises. It did sound like a whimper and a sigh, but that can always be debatable.  The toilet did flush, but I suppose a button could have been stuck. Also, I did do some research shortly after this and discovered that there was a cemetery that had been moved. It would have been located almost directly between the school and the Home Depot.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't live in that area anymore, cause I would love to go back and see if I could have a similar experience. I also wonder if being pregnant could have brought on any interactions?",

        "text": "I have a few experiences, all on the same land, and down the road from our land. These occurrences were years ago. One of them, husband and son believed me immediately because they saw how shaken and excited I was when I came home. THEY were scared by my fright that they drove me back to where I’d had my experience, but what I saw was gone. All I’m going to say about it was they were in the trees, there were many of them, they all turned their heads and looked at me, I was able to put my hand through them, and at least one followed me partway home. I told my brother and father, and the next day, they showed up asking if I was okay and if I might need to go to the (psych hospital). I love them dearly, but I realized we just had to keep it between me, my husband, my children. The second incident was hearing a phone ringing in my daughter’s room (we heard at the same time). I called the phone company asking why there’d be a phone ringing in room with no phone. They just told me maybe my old house had a phone bell somewhere that had been covered over. In the same time frame, we had a front door that the handle would turn right before we reached it to go in. That happened to my family several times and at least two others who knew nothing about it, and were caught by surprise. We decided the best thing to do was just ignore it, and it finally stopped. The last episode was just up the drive at my mother-in-law’s house on the same land as our house. We started seeing a man, and it clearly wasn’t my deceased father-in-law. He was shorter, always in a plaid shirt, jeans, boots, and seemed to be in his 50’s or 60’s. My mother-in-law was bedridden from stroke and had Alzheimer’s, and even she saw this figure, and asked us who it was. Then, two different caregivers saw him at different times, and then the caregiver’s grandchild. One caregiver became very afraid because she had lost her son in an accident and was caring her her traumatized grandson while she sat with our MIL. He almost always appeared peripherally, and he never stayed long. None of us recognized him, he’d just stand and watch us. We tried speaking to him. We tried approaching him. He’d vanish. Finally we decided not be afraid, and just try to ignore it. One caregiver remained frightened for her grandson, but stayed on. After my MIL died, and everyone left, we never saw him again. Now you may thing I made this up or we all imagined everything, but I’ll swear until I die that it all did happen.",

        "text": "This is going to be my experience encountering a shadow figure at work.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit of backstory, I worked at a University doing Security for a bit, mainly during Covid Lockdowns. The University is located near a river and has buildings that are 100+ years old. At the time, we were working 12+hr Shifts, often alone. Since it was 2020 they kicked all the Students and unnecessary Staff out. It made my job easy because if you weren't me, you weren't supposed to be there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were multiple buildings on Campus. The one in question is the 'Science Building', a 5-floor building that was dated about 120 years old. This building was located on a bit of a hill, and on the 'back' side there was a small alley that cut through the woods, running alongside the outer wall. The woods did not have any lighting and were fairly untouched, so the only thing lighting up the area at night was the dim glow through the windows from the small electronics in the classrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was doing a foot patrol round at about 3:00a and was about to cut through the alley. When I got close to the Science Building I felt a significant emotional fog hit me, and butterflies in my stomach. Of course I was already there, and at this point the goal was to finish this round. I had a gut instinct to \\*not\\* look into the windows as I walked by, and then suddenly the anxiety was gone. As I was almost out of the alley I saw some shadow pressed against one of the windows, keeping pace with me. Of course, logically, this made no sense as nothing COULD be casting my shadow onto the window, but I held some sort of strange suspension of disbelief. Mainly for comfort. However, the moment I acknowledged it could be me (somehow), it remained still in a specific window as I continued walking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I ran back to the comfort of the office. The next day when I came to relieve our day guy, I had him join me to go look into what classroom that window was associated with. Unsure the technical name, anatomy? Something. Regardless, the room had jars of fetuses in this locked up closet as well as some other body parts. I was asked if it was about 7-8ft tall, and then informed that it's been seen around by multiple Staff. Hear-say, but supposedly some of the late-night cleaning Staff (pre-covid) quit due to seeing wet footprints in the hallway leading to and from that room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't know if i'd call it evil or malevolent, but it wasn't welcoming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am more than open to questions!!",

        "text": "This one night my senior year after homecoming I decided to stay at one of my friends house. Including me there was about five other people there. We usually would mess around with a spirit box or what ever because we were bored high-schoolers in the Appalachian mountains what else were we supposed to do? We messed around with it for a while then my friend had an idea to play with an ouija board while the others were just chilling on the bed. We weren’t getting any results by playing around with it so we stopped and went back to the spirit box. My father died a few years back and the spirit box said his name then powered itself off. Me and my friends were in shock of course so we decided to call it quits for the night. About an hour passed and my friend had to go outside to go feed his chickens. When he went outside we heard some tapping on the window so we thought it was him playing a joke on us. So we sent our other friend outside to check on him then the tapping began again. At this point we were like “wow so funny guys.” Thinking they both were in on it. Then we heard walking upstairs (we were in the basement of the house) which was weird because no one was there other than my friends in the basement and the two outside. Suddenly the two who were outside bursted inside. The friend who went out first was a pretty big guy who never got scared by anything. His face was completely pale like he had seen a ghost so we were like “what the hell happened?” Apparently when he was outside feeding his chickens he heard something walking in the woods. At first he thought it was a deer or maybe some other animal. But when he went inside the chicken house apparently he heard someone whisper “please help me.” In an airy and deep struggling voice. My friends who were in the basement decided to go back outside with him just to check if there was anyone on the property so obviously they went outside with guns because were county bumpkins. I decided to stay inside because it was colder than a witches tit outside. I was sitting in my friends computer chair just chilling when suddenly it sounded like someone was running around upstairs. Hell it was everywhere it even sounded like it was in the walls at one point. So I ran like hell outside barefoot in like 30 degree weather. I found the guys by the chicken coop and asked if they were pranking me and explained what happened. But all of them had been outside it was just unexplainable. We only used the ouija board for a few minutes but there was just something off. Especially sense things were happening outside the house and inside. I’ve been thinking about posting this for a while. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",

My fraternity was holding a meeting in one of the academic buildings, and it went on until after midnight. I was the last person to leave the building since I had to gather my belongings, and everyone else has a good head start on me. That’s when things started to get strange. As I exited the building, the campus was empty. Despite that, I kept feeling the presence of something right behind me staring daggers. It felt uncomfortably close. As if someone’s face was right over my shoulder. I turned around, and saw nothing. But the tense presence was still there. I started walking faster to get to my dorm across campus, and the presence kept up with me and still felt right on me. There was a small chapel halfway between the academic buildings and my dorm. As soon as I crossed the chapel’s path, I stopped feeling that strange presence, and no longer felt pursued as I walked back to my dorm. What the heck did I encounter? All these years, I still can’t tell if it was just a ghost, or something more malicious.",

These ”spirits” can appear for uou but that doesnt make it truly real.\n\nOr are these beings immune to every sort of thing we can measure as evidence, and if so how would they have known humans would  be able to create cameras, then being invisible to them?",

Husband doesn't even kinda believe in the paranormal, but I have always been sensitive to energies. \nWe live in a tri-level home, so when you walk in the front door you can go downstairs to the left, or upstairs to the right. The garage door is right at the bottom of the downstairs steps. I go down there every night to make sure the garage door is locked before going to bed, and there has always been some strange energy there. \nMy MIL came over a few days ago and she is very sensitive to spirits as well. She tends to hear them, though. I told her about the energy at the bottom of the steps and that it kinda creeped me out, and I think I might have pissed off the spirit by saying that. I should also mention that my husband and FIL have been doing some construction downstairs so that may have also stirred the pot.\nLast night when I went to go check the door, I felt more uneasy than usual. When I went back upstairs, my back started burning. I took off my shirt and my back/shoulders were covered in scratches. \nThis is the first time I have ever been scratched. What do I do about this? I have made spirits angry by talking about them in the past, and they started hissing in my ears at night. I apologized then, and the hissing stopped. So I intend on apologizing again because if I did upset them, they deserve an apology. But scratching is new, and that seems far more serious. What do I do?",

        "text": "Hey everyone, it's time for paranormal story of the week. \n\nThis took place in early 2000s (maybe 2004) in an apartment I lived in with my parents and my brother.   \nBefore I tell the story let me just describe what my room looked like, it's relative to the story. \n\nMy room was pretty basic. Imagine a square. On the bottom of the square is the entrance to the room and to the left, on the same wall is a built-in closet with mirrored doors. On the left wall is a day-bed style bed (looked like a fancy couch). On the top wall is the window covered with Venetian blinds, the cheap coloured aluminum ones. I always close the blinds when I go to sleep, and they were in the down and closed position and the room was rather dark (important to note). On the right wall is my computer desk and some shelves. When I would lie in bed, my head would be towards the windows and my feet towards the closet. I can see the windows from the closet mirror when I look towards my feet. \n\nAlright, so to the story. It was an early Saturday morning, back in early 2000-something and my mom comes into my room and places the cordless phone (remember those?) near me on my bed.   \nWhy? I hear you ask. It's because the answering machine we have is not good enough for her so she needs me to answer the phone when she's not home. Makes total sense.   \nMy mom places the phone near my head and tells me she's going out with my dad and to answer the phone if it rings. Me, barely conscious of her even talking to me, grunt my ascent and go back to sleep.\n\nAround 10 o'clock that morning the phone rings. It's my friend, let's call her Jenny. She had a bad habit of calling me every Saturday at 10 am to wake me up because she's bored. No matter how many times I asked her not to call me so early as it was my only day off during the week and I'd like to sleep in, she still called every Saturday at 10 am. \n\nI groggily answer the phone and this is the short conversation we had:  \nMe: *hello*? (sort of)  \nJ (way too cheerful): *Hey, how's it going? What are you doing? Do you want to meet up*?  \nMe (after a few seconds to realize who I'm talking to): *uuuugh! I'm sleeping*  \nJ: *Come on, let's meet up. I'm bored. Do you want me to come pick you up?*  \nMe (still mumbling): *give me a bit of time, I'll fully wake up and call you back.*   \nJ: *Ok, don't take too long, I'm bored.*  \nMe: *Uh huh.* \n\nI hang up, roll over and fall asleep.\n\nFor about 5 seconds.\n\nThat's when the room floods with light with the sound of *whoooosh.*\n\nI open my eyes and look down towards the mirror at my window and the blinds are now open.   \nYou know how Venetian blinds have one string for pulling the blinds up, and another stick-thing that you twist in order to open and close the \"shutters\"?   \nWell, the shutters were opened in a blink of an eye. Just *whooooosh* and they were open. \n\nI jumped to a sitting position instantly, with my arms over my head as if I'm being held at gunpoint, blinking the bright daylight suddenly streaming in through the window, screaming to an empty room \"*ok, ok... I'm up! I'm up damn it\".* \n\nI picked up the phone and called Jenny and, fully awake now, I said \"*I'm ready, you can come pick me up now\".*  \nShe said \"*ok great, I'll call you when I'm downstairs. I'll be there in twenty minutes\"*  \nI told her \"*don't worry about it, I'll be there waiting already.\"*\n\nI changed clothes at the speed of light and ran out of my room and downstairs, and spent the next 15 minutes smoking furiously until Jenny arrived. \n\nLater that day, when I got back home, I was calm down enough to see wtf happened with the blinds.   \nI mean, if they were open and they fell down I'd blame gravity or the cheap string that held them together.   \nBut they were **opened....** in a blink of an eye. They went up! Against all knows physics and forces of nature - **they went up**!   \nI know the blinds were down beforehand because I'd already been woken up twice prior to that happening and the room was rather dark.   \nUsually to open the shutters you take the stick-thing and twist it about 20 times to get them to open fully. I never, AND I MEAN NEVER, was able to open them that fast myself. I even put the stick-thing between my palms and tried rubbing them really fast in one direction to get them to open that fast, but no, it didn't work. It only opened a small fraction at a time. That stick-thing does not open the blinds that easily. \n\nIt's been around 20 years since that day and I still can't figure out wtf.   \nI guess it was a friendly spirit who knew that I would sleep for a few hours more and make Jenny just wait and wait.   \nAlso, more likely she'd have called me back a few times, and I'd hang up each time with a promise to get up just in order to fall asleep again (an accurate description of what would probably have happened, they know me so well, lol). So the spirit decided to save us both the trouble and just wake me the f up.  \n\nMaybe the \"walls\" between realities, or space-time or whatever, was thin that day, or in that apartment and so, in one reality I went back to sleep while in the other, parallel reality, I actually got out of bed and opened the blinds and went on with my day. I really don't know.\n\nThis is not the only poltergeist activity that has happened in that room. I will write about the other experience next week titled \"my third poltergeist\".\n\nI used to sleep with a nightlight on as I became scared of the dark after a bunch of experiences (I was in my early 20s). That day made me realize that ghosts or spirits don't need darkness in order to haunt or interact with you.\n\nWhat do you think?",

It just watched most the time like a peeping Tom. Makes noises throughout the house. Use to be mostly in the ceiling til I salted the attic entry and it stopped. It has sounded like a full grown ass person fell down with a huge thud once, it likes to knock in like Morse code. But mostly when in bed, I leave the door cracked, it messes around in the doorway, taunting like it wants to be seen but enjoying that it can't. Been a few times where the doorway has literally vibrated , shroom like. I'm not scared of it but annoyed at this point has been several months now. Also it sometimes it brings random aromas I swear it has farted in my face, most recently it has smelled like auto grease, at 1am, while in bed out of nowhere. Like I don't think it's a ghost. But maybe someone's Astral projection, or some kind of tech. Your guess is as good as mine honestly. I have looked into origins or possibilities all dead ends. I've had the house cleansed twice, and saved twice. Nada. It use to only mess with me, but recently has growled at my lady and did some kind of heavy breathing(she gets up at 3am for work). It wasn't like this when we first moved in, but I left for 3 months and came back and the whole vibe was different. Some key things that could have played a role. 1) A black cat started showing up and I was feeding it. 2)My firstborn was on her way(she's 6months now)         3) our neighbors body was dug up the first week we moved in(his wife killed him and buried in backyard)       4) during those 3months gone I was doing alot of ❄️, but been Sober Sober for 7+month now.                                                      5) I was at a job where I suspected a group of people that worked there were part of a satanic cult, and I surely did piss them off\n6) I do alot of research into events of the world, and know some stuff that a vast majority doesn't.\nLike I said I don't know what it is, who it is. But it isn't going away it is annoying, taunting and petty. Again this is short version.",

You could argue my spirit guide is just a figment of my imagination but I feel deeply with my heart and soul they exist in some other realm. I won't get into much detail unless people would like to know more about my spirit guide. Well, their name is Alexis and they are associated with the fae and fae realm. This being is gender neutral or androgynous and doesn't really enjoy labels that humans put on everything. Their appearance can change very slightly depending on what energy is stronger that moment (feminine or masculine). The funny thing is that Alexis is a gender neutral name and didn't realize that until looking it up. Basically, Alexis is very bombastic and extroverted which is definitely the opposite of me. They are super friendly and their energy is so powerful that I feel more in touch with the higher realms. A basic run down of their appearance is long mint green hair, fair skin, plenty of freckles, super tall (like not of human height but they can make themselves be around the height of a tall male), broad shoulders, yet has an athletic frame. Essentially, their appearance encompasses both the masculine and feminine energy within us all. I've been working with Alexis and only known them for a few months but I've noticed a drastic improvement in myself. I used to be fearful of men due to personal reasons but I have improved to the point where I am comfortably platonic with them. I associate this with working with Alexis and being enlightened regarding masculine energy. I don't want to make this post any longer than it already is. If you know your spirit guide feel free to tell me about them or if you want me to talk more about my experiences with Alexis, just let me know.",

One day, my cousin came over and we both were using my computer. I had never told her about the tooth fairy website or mentioned anything tooth fairy related to her or anybody in my household, so today I decided to. I showed her the website, showed her my tooth fairy on it and told her that I was interested in them. On the website, you can write your tooth fairies a letter. I never knew this so I decided to write my tooth fairy one. As soon as I finished writing the letter and pressed send, the tooth fairy told me to go upstairs and check underneath my pillow. So my cousin and I rushed upstairs, went into my bedroom and when I slid my hand beneath my pillow, there was a letter. I don’t remember exactly what the letter said since this was years ago, but I remember the tooth fairy said she was watching me, mentioned my cousin and there was a drawn picture of the tooth fairy on the side. I remember I was so amazed and when I looked up, I saw that my bedroom window was open. Looking back at this, I think it’s pretty creepy. I even asked my cousin about this last year (she is an adult now) and she said it was creepy.",

        "text": "Two weeks ago, just after lunchtime, I went into my bedroom en suite to go the bathroom. When I came out of the bathroom, on the bedroom floor was an object that I did not recognize- in fact, it was so unfamiliar to me that I kind of nudged it with my foot to see if it was hard or soft or what. After tapping it with my foot, I realized that it was a crystal - quartz amethyst I think.\n\nNow, it’s only my wife and our twenty-something daughter who live in our house, and no one has crystals or is into crystals. So, I picked it up and rinsed it off with cool water, but didn’t tell anyone about it for a couple of hours. When no one mentioned it, I said something to my wife and she knew nothing of it (as expected.) Later on, my daughter walked into our bedroom to ask my wife a question and saw the crystal and assumed that my wife was meditating or something, since she’d never seen the crystal before.\n\nI was feeling increasingly creeped out, but the next day began to consider that it might be possible that this crystal had been “provided” to me. I’ve been going through a lot and working on my depression. Could this be? Has anyone heard of this kind of thing happening? You know where an object just appears in your home. I want to feel good about this, but it still makes me feel uneasy if I think about it too long.",

        "text": "Okay so I need some advice..I believe my house is haunted. \nI have very recently (last 2 months) got into spirituality, however I have believed my house was haunted for much longer ( over a year.. since I moved in)..\n\nSo past two months I’ve been interested in meditation, crystals, chakras, affirmations, all that positive stuff..\nBut recently my experience with meditation has been a bit weird…\nI’m 99% sure my house is haunted.. I’ve had THE WEIRDEST experience here which I will write after explaining why I’m worried.\n\nRecently during meditation, my body has been involuntarily moving around. My head went all the way back and all the way forward.. \nSo naturally I did a little bit of research into my experience with meditation.. \nmost sources state this as completely normal and your body NEEDING to do this subconsciously and that’s why it’s happening. \n\nSo I ignored it and continued.. but obviously as much as it’s common, it’s not THAT common that it’s happening to the majority of people, is it? A lot of people sit completely still during meditation.. \n\nAnyway, today my friend meditated in my house with me today, and we both had the same experience of head movement during meditation and this is where I’m starting to get freaked out!\n\nSo could this be in connection with ‘spirits’ in my house? And do you believe those spirits are good or bad? I will continue to explain..\n\nBefore I get into what ‘haunted things’ have happened in my house I would like to mention that other weird things I have experienced alongside movements during meditation, Normally AFTER a mediation session is over.. I feel vibrations in my chakras, particularly my root chakra, but I have also felt vibrations in my third eye, crown, throat, heart.. \n\nSo I have had some negative haunted experience in my house.. I do seem to get sleep paralysis.. on two occasions I couldn’t go back to sleep all night because I knew it would happen again.. and even after keeping myself up it happened. I don’t always ‘hallucinate’ during sleep paralysis but I have heard screaming and screeching on a few occasions. \nPS. I dont recall ever experiencing sleep paralysis elsewhere, and I always feel terrified afterwards..\n\nThe scariest negative experience I’ve had in my house is when me and my partners phones broke, completely randomly WITHIN A HOUR between eachother.. HOWEVER, I do feel like it could possibly be a ‘HUMBLING experience’ \nLet me elaborate-\nMy partner and I had a disagreement, and then he was quite ‘toxic’ in what he said. He dropped his phone very lightly, it was completely fine before hand… and the screen smashed, and the phone was completely inaccessible, it didn’t turn on, it was broken.\n\nWe both meditated together about an hour later, i started bragging about how ‘gods always got me’ and ‘everytime you do me wrong something bad happens to you ha ha!’ And IMMEDIATELY after, I leaned VERY slightly on my phone… the screen was broken, and same thing, it didn’t turn on.\n\nI was TERRIFIED this night because I was already sure before this point my house was haunted. I was scared that maybe this was the night something would happen to us and our phones being broken were to remove outside contact.\n\nAnother ‘dark’ (but not exactly negative) experience I had was once instead of a baby monitor for my daughters bedroom, I used two phones as my baby monitor wasn’t working. Meaning I left one phone in my daughters bedroom and took my main phone downstairs with me to hear her..\nAnyway a few hours through my night randomly there was a bunch of muffled whispers through the baby monitor/phone speaker, before the phone hung up immediately after.. this not being my first experience of paranormal activity and it being in my daughters bedroom TERRIFIED me. Half an hour later I was talking to my friend who was in the house and had witnessed it, and we sat in the living room speaking about how weird it was, then a matching pair of shoes fell off the shoe rack.. there was no wind in the room, no movement anywhere near it, we were completely still on the other side of the room, the shoes were well placed on the shoe rack and this had never happened before this moment..\n\nThe FIRST time I realised my house was ‘haunted’ - neutral energy experience -\nAfter experiencing random things like ‘weird noises’ and other ‘normal haunted experiences’ and having weird suspicions, this one day I went into he attic one day and there was some paper decoration in the middle of the attic.. I had already put things up there before this moment and never saw this decoration before.. so obviously I thought that was extremely weird, that this decoration appeared out of nowhere..\nI took it out of the middle of the room and placed it near the stairs as I went down.. forgot about it..\nNext time I went up, few days later, it was in the EXACT same position, in the middle of the room… I thought there’s no way, I vividly remember moving it, so i said to myself and my friend out loud, I AM MOVING IT to the same place again, if it goes back into the middle SOMETHINGS WRONG!!\n\nbefore going into the attic the next time, I said to my friend before going in.. let’s see if this decoration is in the middle of the room again, if it is… there’s SOMETHING up!!\n\nSo I went up the stairs, and not only had it gone back to the middle of the room… but there were TWO OF THEM… in the middle of the room… when I had been up and down several times. From this moment onwards I never doubted spiritual energy in this house again. \n\nOther neutral things that have happened-\nWeird / foot steps noises / creaking (cliché) but always coming from attic \nBath water splashing aggressively side to side on its own with no wind \nMy daughter speaking to random things and looking random places as a baby \nClothes hangers aggressively swinging on the rails with no wind\nRandom objects falling down.\n\n\n\nON A POSITIVE note-\nI ALWAYS receive positive messages, I keep seeing my angel numbers EVERYWHERE! My grounding chakra vibrating links exactly with all my other messages, I had a tarot reading done and I asked about my current place in life, I had a lot of cards relating to being grounded in home life, financial life and telling me I’m on the right track\nWhy would I be so spiritually grounded in a place that contains negative spirit/energy???\n\nPs I have crystals in my bedroom and I light incense nearly everyday!! \n\nAs I said I’m very new to all this spiritual stuff so could someone please give me their opinion and advice!!\nThanks in advance!",

Everyone in the home rushed to see her, except for my dad who was sleeping, as he hasnt slept for the last 24+ hours and worked all during this period.\n\nNow everyone is at the hospital, and grandma took her last breaths there and eventually joined the creator.\n\nDad came to the hospital and the hospital's staff took him and his brothers to the morgue, to see her body.\n\n They took DadiJi's body out and dad suddenly exclaimed that grandma's eyes are wide open and she's staring him in anger and pointing at him, to which his brothers simply said that he might be hallucinating. He got really disturbed by this sight and it still haunts him till now.\n\nThis is where my dad starts blaming himself for her demise (for some unknown reason). He constantly keeps on saying that he could've prevented it all if he brought her back home.\n\nNow my sister, she also getting some haunted dreams of our grandma, and in our beliefs and traditions, it is said that it's not a good sign to get dreams of the dead. They all say that DadiJi isn't appearing in my dreams cause she used to love me the most out of everyone ( doesn't makes sense to me but yeah).\n\nFast forward to today, i got to know that dad has been getting calls from DadiJi's number, since she died. And when he calls it back, it says that the number has been deactivated/temporarily disabled. \n\nMy sister also had a bad dream about her the last week. The condition has gone so bad that she now gets afraid is she looks at any photograph of DadiJi.\n\nDuring these two years, there have been instances when dad got these dreams as well and he hasn't been able to sleep. \n\nThis is affecting him psychologically a lot. Can someone provide any help on this?",

However in a short time two rather strange things have happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grandfather recently had a major health scare, he was in critical condition for a week, before getting better on Sunday Monday and Tuesday and finally passing away this morning. From Sunday until this morning he was lucid in his conversations and was easy to talk to. However, he was saying crazy things (like he had seen walking on the beach all morning, that he had seen a dragon, or that he had hit his foot on the door while carrying my cousin, even though he is on a bed and can't get up and my cousin is 200km away), the doctors told us that this was normal with his treatments. The strange things started when he started talking about dead people (his brother, his wife, his parents...), he would say something, wait a few seconds as if someone would answer him and then talk again (it could last a long time) in his \"allucinations\" he would only talk with dead people. Until yesterday when he started to talk to his neighbour, who to our knowledge was alive, at the time we didn't pay much attention. Today, when we heard that he had died, we called his friends to invite them to the funeral ceremony and we learned that the neighbour he was talking to had died on Monday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill related to this story, according to the doctor he died between 5 and 7 in the morning, my aunt came to see her and as she lives far away, she sleeps in my grandfather's house in his absence, this morning at 8:30, she was awakened by the sound of footsteps moving around the appartment, a bit worried she sent a message in the family whatsapp group to know if someone had come in the appartment, nobody had come, all the doors were closed, it was only around 9am that the hospital called us to tell us about the death. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to think, normally I'm very sceptical but I'm starting to wonder, maybe my opinion will change with this story\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(if this is not clear, sorry English is not my first language)",

        "text": "In 2014 my beloved stink dog Jesse passed away. He was 14 glorious years young. Heart disease came fast and took him faster. But I wasn't there when he passed.\n\nMy mother and I shared him. Two years on and two years off around. We got him from a man who had 15 puppies in a huge laundry basket in Morgan Hill, California. I was 9 and my mom told me to pick one. I couldn't believe it. We hadn't had a dog since Fritz, our Doberman. But the one I wanted was in another girl's arms.\n\nShe was around 19 with tattoos and piercings, like me now, and said that he was hers once her mom came out of the dentist office. I almost started a fist fight over him, telling her she had my dog and to give him to me. While we were arguing, her mother came out. She immediately told the girl no way and to put that thing down. I just grabbed him out her arms and politely thanked her for holding my dog for me. I was a determined, smartmouthed, little shit.\n\nWe paid 15 bucks for a super dog. A Chow/Husky/Shepard mix. Stout stocky boy, Chow size with Shepard markings and husky fur. Jesse knew over 85 commands and would always make us laugh. He was the smartest, most wonderful dog ever. I could go on and on about him...\n\nWell in January of 2014, we made the switch. I was moving from New Mexico back to Washington with my grandparents. We stopped in California and it almost killed me to give him to my mama. I just knew that this was the last time I would see him. I didn't know why but I loved him as much as I could before leaving. Honestly I was mad at mama because my brain thought, \"She won't give him back!\" I never acted on that thought or took it out on mama. It was just a thought.\n\nThat day in August I was swimming in the lake with gramma. My phone went off. Something told me not to answer yet. When I checked it, lake day was over. It was like my world ended. Dramatic I know, but I treat my animals like my children and nephews (I'm infertile.).\n\nFrom his death to 2017 shit was going down in the family and I was depressed. I had my boyfriend, now husband, move in with me and things were going well. But I was still depressed. All I wanted was to see Jesse one more time. He was all I wanted in my worst moments.\n\nI would beg for him to visit me in my dreams since the day he passed. It's so hard for me to let go. All our other dogs except gramma's Mexican footballs had passed. Only my cats remained with me. And I was still begging for him to visit.\n\nOne night I rolled over on my back, alseep but aware of my surroundings. If that makes any sense. My man was next to me within inches. But between us... I felt him! His form, warmth, his wirey fur. It was amazing. My skin tingled and I could actually feel his weight on me. But I knew if I opened my eyes, he would disappear. It was bittersweet as I enjoyed laying with my boy one more time. Even though I wasn't able to actually see him with my eyes.\n\nI'm greedy and want him to visit again, but I know he's busy guarding the gates above. My mama always tells me that our dogs will lead us home. Those who have passed we have told them to look for Jesse. He will take you to the pack. All the animals and people who have left us.\n\nSorry this is long, there must be onions growing in my closet. I don't fully let go until I start what I call another generation. Another dog is finally in my near future, but Jesse will always hold a huge piece of my heart.\n\nJesse, I hope you visit me again. I will always love and miss you.",

I have two apartment-mates, but both were at work. Our washing machine is in our bathroom, and was off and not being used at the moment. On top of the washing machine, we keep a medium-sized bucket/bin in case we want to hand-wash something before putting it in the machine. \n\nAgain: washing machine was NOT on when this happened. I’m in my room (next to bathroom) and here a loud thud. I look into the bathroom and the bin is on the floor a little over a meter away. I was really confused, trying to see if there was a logical explanation. It was not sitting near the edge of the machine, as I was just in the bathroom and had moved it after closing the window. It was sitting in the center of the washing machine top. There was nothing turned on in the room that could have caused a shaking or vibrating, there were no opened windows, and I checked that nothing had fallen off a wall or anything. \n\nI know this isn’t the most thrilling thing, but I will experience unexplainable things like this from time to time, and so I always wonder if there might be something more to it.

        "text": "Sorry y’all I’ve been exhausted with work and this next part is kinda emotional for me as it involves a family friend passing away. Again I’ll try not to ramble and I’ll try to keep this structured as possible so it’s easier to understand.\n\nIncident 3:\nWe have a family friend named Donnie Ray. For some background on him he was a family friend as long as I can remember but some would say he was a bit of an odd character. He distrusted cars with a passion so he rode his bike everywhere even if it was 30 miles away. He also lived in an abandoned house and used a toilet seat over a bucket since there was no actual toilet and set up his own irrigation up near a stream to the house so he could have water. He was a kind soul and we loved when he came to visit us. We mostly went to visit him but sometimes he’d bike the 25 miles himself as a surprise visit. On this particular day he came in the morning and by midday me, my mother, and Donnie Ray were chilling on the front porch while they were drinking mixed drinks and I had my sweet tea. My mom finished her drink and asked Donnie Ray if he wanted another as she was about to go inside and make her another. He said sure why not and she went inside. Not 30 seconds later, my “mom” came from the side of the house with different clothes on and walked up towards us. What’s weird about that is, to come from the side of the house she would’ve had to go all the way to the back door and then come all the way around. We said “what are you doing I thought you were going to make drinks?” She said “Don’t worry about that we can just talk.” She proceeded to talk about death and suffering kind of in a laughing manner as if she found it enjoyable. We didn’t say anything while she talked bc we were still wondering how she changed her clothes that fast. Suddenly in the middle of her talking she said “I gotta go” and sprinted around the side of the house. Not 30 seconds after that my mom came back through the front door with 2 drinks in her hand and her original clothes on. We both started back and she was like “Why are y’all tripping?” And we told her that she had come around the house with different clothes on talking crazy. She of course didn’t believe us and thought we were playing a joke on her. We dropped the subject and went back to chilling. After a bit I wanted to go ride my bike. My mom was pretty strict growing up so the only place I could ride my bike was the church/ cemetery parking lot across the street. I begged Donnie Ray to come with me since none of my school friends were allowed over so I wanted the company while he was there. My mom told me no of course but he said it was alright and we set off to ride bikes around the parking lot because that was a as far as I could go. After a while he said “Hey baby I wanna show you something in a little” I said okay let’s go to the grotto first and we biked down to the grotto behind the church. We sat on the bench there and he asked what the grotto was for and I told him you could pray or just think if you want. We sat in silence for a few minutes til he said “Follow me.” He led me down to the cemetery part and we stopped in front of a grave. He said “That’s my brother right there he died when he was a young man” I said “I’m sorry Donnie Ray. What was he like?” He told me then started crying and said “The angels have been talking to me and they said that he’s waiting for me.” I asked “What do you mean?” “I’m gonna die soon sweetheart. The angels have been telling me so for a while now.” I said “Are you sick?” “No I’m not and I don’t know how I’m going to die I just know my time is coming soon.” I was like “No you’re not gonna die Donnie Ray it’s okay. It’ll be okay and it’s okay to be scared.” We hugged and stood there in silence for a little bit then wordlessly we came back to the house. He spent a few more hours then biked back home.\n\nIncident 4: \nA few months after that weird day, we were about to go to sleep when my stepdad got a call. It was Donnie Ray’s mother telling us that he had gotten hit by a drunk driver while on his bike. They couldn’t even find all his body parts that’s how hard he got hit. Everybody started crying and freaking out. Suddenly a trash can in the kitchen we were all in started shaking. We froze and my stepdad screamed “LEAVE NOW YOU’RE NOT WELCOME HERE” and it stopped. After a few minutes of us all standing around miserable we shuffled off to bed. I thought back to what Donnie Ray had told me and I cried into my pillow all night.\n\nI’m probably gonna do a part 3 as soon as I’m able to muster the energy. Please comment if you have any questions or need any more info.",

        "text": "Until a few months ago I was a massive sceptic but recently I've had enough stuff happen to me and learn stuff from my mum that is making me a lot more open minded and to the point I am moving out of my place. Want to see what people think/if you can think of ways to debunk this please do!\n\nSorry it's longer then I was expecting just trying to be detailed and feel lost, if I accept this stuff it's gonna change my sense of the world which I don't want 😅 I've broken it up into context, background, big event and now the current stuff.\n\nContext: I'm turning 25 in May and until recently viewed this stuff as bs/always brushed it off. \nI live in North Wales (UK) just 5miles outside the Snowdonia mountain range in a town with a university. I've learnt recently, after weird stuff has really kicked off we're directly on something called a \"lay line\" (my understanding they're channels of energy across the world).\nI live alone in a converted chapel that's been turned into apartments that boarders the main road one side and some broad leaf woodland the other. And I don't do drugs or on medication. And my flat doesn't share walls with any other apartments or have one above me.\n\nBackground: When I first moved into my current place 4yr ago other residents would claim they've had encounters/seen stuff in the building but put it down to them being biase as it's a chapel we all live in.\nFor the first few years I've felt randomly uneasy, like at night if I want to get a drink from the fridge I get out of bed, feel like I'm being watched and felt uncomfortable enough I decided to go back to bed instead. But again put it down to living by myself in a creepier setting. \nThere was one time I thought I saw a \"shadow\" figure BUT I went out drinking that night, got back home, left my lights on and passed out on the sofa then suddenly woke up and thought I saw I figure standing over me looking into some of my frog tanks. I just told them \"Feel free to look at my frogs but don't be a weirdo.\" Then passed out again. This memory stuck with me some reason BUT I've always put this down to me being drunk, tbh even now I do but thought it was worth noting. But yeah had a few things on and off but dismissed it.\n\nThen I got my dog and over the last few years every now and then he'd randomly be set off by one corner of my room. He'll be growling, barking, hackles up and if I tell him to be quiet he won't and if I try to walk in my bedroom he'll block me and not let me in. Not turning to face me but stepping infront if me and not letting me pass while still going nuts at the corner. Then all of a sudden (like snap of the fingers) he'll stop and go back to being fully relaxed and hop back in his bed.\nThen when I got my cat there would randomly be times were the dog will do this while the cat is staring at the same spot fur all puffed up and screaming, hissing, spitting and again randomly like snap of the fingers they'll both stop and settle down and act like nothing happened.\nBut I never really thought too much of it as it would happen so sporadically (like might got 2-3months of nothing).\n\nRecently things have started changing. Back in January I've started being woken up some point between 3am &amp; 3:30am by the dog standing over my body going nuts at that corner and the cat at my feet doing the same screaming, hissing, fur puffed up etc and they won't stop if I tell them too then again all of a sudden they stop and go back to sleep. But rather then being every few months it was happening 1-2times a week.\n\nFirst big thing: Then one night 19th of January I was walking the dog late down at the woods (around midnight) and normal I put one ear pod in to listen to music. But when I reached the entrance for some reason I just decided not to have any ear pods on (wasn't feeling on edge just a passive \"nah not gonna put it in\".\nWalk like normal for like 10min then the next sequence of events all happened in the space of a few seconds. \nMy dog goes running off the path barking and going nuts at something, I look in the direction he's gone in. I then turn to look at the path ahead of me and I swear I saw a tall figure (I'd guess 7ft tall or maybe a few inches less) standing about 15 meter ahead of me. And it's was the darkest shade of black I've ever seen. As I'm looking at it fades away, not blink and it's gone but faded Infront of my eyes legs and arms first then torso then head. For a split second I figured it was my eyes playing tricks on me and my vision just readjusted. But then my dog comes sprinting out if the woods and runs to the spot where I thought I saw this thing and he just stands there franticly barking going nuts.\nI decided to carry on walking because if I turned back the way I came I'd be in the woods for another 10min plus when I exit I'll still be I a very dark and secluded area for an extra 5min but if I carry on straight in under 5min I'll reach a side path that takes out out if the woods straight onto the main road and at the entrance of a housing estate.\nI get past the point where my dog is standing and barking a then my dog follows me. A few seconds later I suddenly feel really cold (but out that down to placebo effect as I had gotten in my head at this point) and then feel like something's following behind me and like 1m behind me and my dog turns around and starts barking again. The whole time I'm walking he's walking right next to me but he's walking backwards constantly barking. \nI don't turn around and pull my phone out and I had zero signal or 4g (thats the first time I've been without ever and I go wild camping a lot) and my phone is on 8%. When I checked it 10-15min earlier when I was initially going to connect my head pods I was over 60%. I didn't turn around to look behind me at all.\nThis carriers on until I go under the bridge that the main road goes all over and like snap of the fingers the dog stops barking and potters off, does a wee and act like nothing happened.\n\nOnce I'm in the housing estate I let myself freak out and had 4g again so sent some voice notes to a mate to see if he's awake, didn't want to phone incase he was asleep, and everyone who heard them says they've never heard me terrified like that and it's what really get my sceptic friends thinking seriously about this as I'm not someone who gets scared easily and when I am scared I'm good at hiding it and dealing with what's happening (like when we went camping in Sweden and bumped into a bear I just went up to it yelling and squaring up and got it to back off and when we've had two guys try to mug us in Manchester at knife point I carried on walking towards them and called their bluff and told them to actually do something or f**k off and they back off).\n\nCurrent: Since that night things have gotten worse in my place. The animals waking me up and kicking off at the corner has been happening up to 5 nights a week, I've been waking up with weird scratches on me. I checked it's not the dog or cat, no matter what angle I try I can't make the same scratches with my nails, there's nothing in my bed and no springs poking out that could cause it and it's weird positions like my thighs (inner, back and top thigh), top of my feet and toes, side of my body as well as arms etc. 2 weeks ago same thing, dog at cat kick off and at that point I'm just angry. So I get out of bed, go in the corner and just say \"If I could touch you and smack you, dozy c*nt now f*CK off will you!\" And the dog and cat suddenly stop so I go back to sleep. A few hr later I fell out of bed, maybe I rolled out of bed though it's a double so pretty big but what was weird was my blanket was still on the bed and my dog was over me barking at that corner and my cat was by my head screaming and puffed up staring at the corner and my spare wardrobe (which is empty) door was wide open. But maybe if I just rolled out the sudden noise and movement freaked them out and maybe the vibrations from me thudding caused the door to open.\nThen a couple of weeks ago in the afternoon my dog and cat were at the groomers I was on facetime with a mate and my bedroom light turned off (including the actual switch clicking and changing to the off position). I go over and turn it back on, turn around and I hear the click and the light turned off. I turn it on again then as I sit back on bed it turns off. This goes back and forth for a few min till my mate in call suggested just leaving it off and see what happens. About 1min goes past and it turns back on and I see the switch turn. Then bit less the a minute later turns off again. I go to turn it back on and this goes back and forth then after about 15min from when it first turned off  it suddenly stops and I've not had that issue since.\nI'm pretty freaked out but keeping it inside and I phone my mum saying I need to stay at hers for a few days.\nI check the trains and I had a 6pm, 7pm, 8pm and 9pm left that day.\nI aim for the 7pm.\nI pack everything I need in my general back pack which looked fine, get outside and walk about 50m then all of a sudden my main strap broke. I was an old backpack but it looked and felt fine when I was packing but maybe the stitching on the underside were worn and I over packed the bag so it broke. So I miss that train and go to grab my hiking/camping backpack that was on the same hanger as the other one to repack. But before checking I quickly chuck something in the oven as I hadn't eaten that day yet and figured I'd have time.\nGo to grab the other backpack and it's not on the hanger. After frantically looking for ages I find it in the empty wardrobe. Maybe I put it in there when packing my original bag and forgot but just weird as I haven't used that wardrobe since I lived there.\nBy the time repack I don't have time for food so I pull it out yet oven and leave.\nI make it too the train station and suddenly have that dread of forgetting to do something. In this case was can't remember if I turned the oven off but ignore it as I've never left anything like that on before and have lived alone since I was 16. As I'm always paranoid about fire as I keep a bunch of frogs and snakes etc so always make sure the dryer, oven, washing machine etc is off before leaving. Reach the point I'm too stressed and I have to go back to confirm it missing the 8pm train. BUT this time I actually did leave the oven on. Obviously it's probably from me being stressed and rushing so I must if forgotten but that's not like me and while it's probably is coincidence I couldn't help but feel dread in my gut feeling like something didn't want me to leave.\nI make the 9pm train. And when I was at my mum's I felt fully relaxed.\n\nThen this pass weekend my mum decided to come down. And the first night she was down I had the best night sleep I've had in that flat for months but she said she had one of the worse night sleeps she's ever had and was convinced someone was walking about in her room. Said she didn't turn the light in but could hear footsteps etc. And the instant she walked in my room she pointed to the corner and asked if that's the one as she hates it.

        "text": "So I have no idea if this is the right subreddit to talk about what I have been going through but I just really need to write this down. Warning this is a long post! \n\n\nSince I was a little girl I have had recurrent nightmares about the same presence. Each dream is different but includes the same invisible dark presence that I can sense is there. Not a shadow person but you can just feel its there. \n\nIn some dreams I am having just a normal dream and then I will stop and notice that this ghost is in the background of my dream just watching in the background and I will just brush it off and continue on with my dream. He doesn't interact with me at all.  Other dreams he is the center of the dream and he will move furniture around and I will typically try to alert my family that he is in the room with us and we need to leave. Sometimes they believe me and will listen. And finally in some dreams this ghost figure is violent. It will push me. Choke me. In one nightmare he tried to drown me in the bathtub. I can not see him but I feel everything as if he was real. I know he is there. In another dream he tried to take my newborn baby from my arms but I fought against it. Its never a different person or thing..it is always this ghost figure that haunts me. I have had dozens and dozens of dreams about him. My husband even knows him as 'The Ghost' and if I wake up from a nightmare he will ask if it was about 'The Ghost.'\n\nSo in present day my spouse and I have moved into this home and have been here almost a year. Its a beatiful older house. We met the owners of the home. They were the original owners and even designed the home. They raised their children in this home until the kids moved out. They were a lovely old little couple. \nThe house has 3 floors. The basement, the 1st floor which has the master bedroom and the 2nd floor which has 3 bedrooms (2 guest bedrooms and a playroom for my daughter) \n\n\nBeing in the second floor it feels so strange. Like there is something watching me. Sometimes i will see my daughters toys move out the corner of my eye but I will ignore it and think I am imagining things. Or i feel someone peaking around the corner. The lights will flicker once in a while randomly or turn off completey. I really hate being in there but my daughter loves playing there. Our dog and cat dont seem bothered either so I try to ignore it. Sometimes I can hear the ocassional footsteps from downstairs but I blame it on it being an older home. \n\nMy daughter and I are really currently sick so last night my husband decided to sleep in one of the guest bedrooms upstairs as to not expose himself to our germs. \nIt was about 11pm and I am scrolling on my phone and he texts me asking if i had gone up. I tell him no, I am just laying in bed with my daughter just scrolling on my phone. He says the guest bedroom door opened wide open and closed shut and he thought it was me. We have a motion sense nightlight up there in the hallway and he says that didn't turn on either so it was strange. Hearing all that scared the crap out of me. The odd things I have noticed I brushed it off as my imagination but to know he saw something just made me realize there is something here. I will continue to ignore it in hopes it gets bored but I am not going to lie I am so scared of going up there anymore. He doesn't believe in ghosts so he was able to keep sleeping up there with no issue but I have not slept at all. \nI have no idea what to do now. I am not sure if my dreams are connected at all. \n\n\nSo sorry for the long rant. Needed to share this with someone.",

My sister (12) and I were \"camping\" in the living room and sleeping in a tent we had set up, just for fun. At some point, I'm not sure if I had woken up or had barely been falling asleep, but I noticed a wizard-like figure going down the stairs (or up, I don't remember exactly). I remember initially being confused, but I can't recall being scared (which I normally am terrified of any unexpected noise).\n\nI say it was Dumbledore because it clearly resembled a wizard with a pointy hat and long beard and it appeared to be floating/gliding on the stairs. Creepy, right?\n\nI'm not sure when my sister and I first talked about that night we camped together, but I recall talking to her about that night a few years ago. She mentioned how she saw a strange figure going up the stairs, too. The exact same thing. A wizard like person with a beard floating on the stairs.\n\nWho knows, at this point I'm thinking maybe we discussed that night when we woke up the next day and she could've told me what she saw and I just eventually created that as a personal memory for myself. You know how kids do that and think its their own memory. Or maybe we both did see the same thing that night.",

A few months ago, I was staying at my cousin's farmhouse in the countryside, where I had always felt an eerie feeling but never really thought much of it. One summer night, while lying in bed, I heard slow and deliberate footsteps outside my door. I called out to my cousin, but there was no answer. Suddenly, the doorknob began to turn, but the door remained locked. As I lay there, paralyzed with fear, I saw a tall and shadowy figure with piercing red eyes through the crack in the door. The figure just stood there, staring at me for what felt like hours. Eventually, it vanished, but I still felt a sense of dread wash over me. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still there with me. It took me several days to recover from the experience, and I still don't know what I saw that night. This encounter has left me with a newfound appreciation for the paranormal and a healthy respect for the unknown, that is why I'm posting my experience here. To those who have also experienced something similar to me, how are you feeling? Was your experience like mine?",

I finally jumped in, and the ice covered me. Free at last...\n\nThis guy punched through the ice and grabbed me by the shoulders of my coat and dragged me out.\n\nHe had been driving his truck across the lake. In a blizzard. Yep. Perfectly normal behavior...(not in a blizzard!!).\n\nHe was extremely pleased with himself, and chattered brightly at me about seeing me step into the hole and how those fishermen were so irresponsible. He was amused by the whole deal.\n\nHe drove me straight to my car. Which, by the way, I had hidden so it wouldn't be found, it was covered in snow, and visibility was about three feet (.914 m).\n\nDropped me off, smiling and waving, and disappeared.\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell him how much I hated him. It wasn't until later that it really settled in for me that he definitely wasn't human.\n\nNo way a human could have stumbled on me in that whiteout. No way a human could have known where my car was hidden. Impossible for both. And I was dry by the time he dropped me off even though it was only minutes.",

        "text": "TLDR at the end. This was the most intense sleep paralysis I (24f) ever had. When I was 14 living with my dad, I had a boyfriend who lived on my street in our trailer park. He would sneak out at night &amp; come to my window. I woke up one night hearing a knock on the window and sat up in bed.\n\nMy room looked the same, except the curtains on my window, along with some of the posters on my wall, were gone. This makes me think I was having an out of body experience for a moment. When I looked out the window, I saw my boyfriend. He was wearing a black sweater and black beanie, which was odd. I didn't expect to see him so I smiled, but only for a moment. Immediately it felt off.\n\nThe thing seemed to sense this change in emotion, and suddenly it wasn't my boyfriend. Its face just shifted in the weirdest way. It became pale, and its eyes were 2 black holes with eyelids. It had thin lips that were pulled tightly together as if it was angry. I froze in fear and a panic attack set in as I seemed to fall back into my body on the bed, paralyzed. I tried screaming for my dad but of course I couldn't. My heart was pounding. This thing began climbing through my window, slow &amp; smooth as if it just floated through, looking at me with the blackness that was its eyes. It climbed on top of me &amp; got right in my face.\n\nI then woke up panicking, and I must have passed out from fear or something because I went back to sleep not long after. I tried telling my dad, but he assured me it was a bad nightmare. \n\nAbout 7 years later, my dad came to visit my family in our new place &amp; said he had to tell me something. (My dad still lived in the same trailer) He said that the night before, he woke up &amp; couldn't move or speak. He noticed ME in his room standing beside his bed, watching him. He knew it wasn't me because it felt off. He told me he remembered the thing I told him about years ago &amp; that he finally understood. \n\nI know people who have seen different things in their SP experiences, but I only know that my dad &amp; I have experienced something like this one. I'd love to hear others' stories. \n\nTLDR: I had a sleep paralysis where the demon pretended to be my bf, changed its face to something else. Years later, my dad had one too, and it made itself look like me.",

She was the baby whisperer. A tradition we always did was if anyone in the family had a baby, their first Christmas, she would feed them a small amount of marinara sauce. Like barely a full taste. Recipe that’s been handed down for almost 150 years. Family was from Italy, came here after civil war. She was the best grandmother ever! Her name was Shirley. She passed June 5, 1993. I was almost 13. Day before my dads birthday. Devastated me!! \n\nOn to the thing!! I was married to my son’s father at the time. My son was a year and a half old. I had been missing my grandmother so much at that time. I imagined how my son would interact with her. One night I got a visit from her and got my answer. I remember everything. I was watching my son play with his toys. Running around and laughing. The room we were in was infinite! I couldn’t see walls or windows or any furniture at all! Just pure white light everywhere. No end to this room in sight. I look to my right and there she is!!! I run to her!! I hug her and I can smell her hair, perfume, lotion she used! All of that! I hugged her and cried. “Where have you been! I’ve missed you!” She told me word for word “You are such a good mom and he is so beautiful. I love you.” \nI woke up in full cry mode sitting straight up! Pillow soaked with tears and I could STILL SMELL HER!! Was this her or am I just misinterpreting this dream! It was so real!!!!",

My dad then approached the dog when he heard a weird rustling sound right behind him. He turned around to check it. There was nothing. When he looked back at the dog it was gone. He said it just vanished and there was nowhere for it to have ran to or hide that fast. It was the middle of an open field in front of the forest. \n\nThere was another time someone from my family has seen this dog, my grand dad. When I was visiting him he told me a story that was nearly identical to the one my dad told me. The only difference was that he heard a \"hoosh\" sound behind him, instead of rustling.\n\nI didnt believe both stories untill one day when I was on my way back from school I took a turn and in the middle of the sidewalk there was (as you are probably guessing) this big white dog. It was unnaturally white. It looked like it was reflecting the sunlight. It had light blue eyes and flattened ears. It was so weird i just stared at it, not moving an inch. It was staring back at me. Then i heard something behind me. I heard footsteps.They sounded so close that if there was actually someone behind me I would feel their breathing on my neck. I turned around, but there was nothing. I looked back at the dog and it was gone. No sound, no nothing. It just vanished.\nDo yall have any idea what could all of this be or what it could mean?",

He reminded me of the real estate agent from the movie vivarium, that turned out to be alien. He didn’t have and accent or come off as disabled but he was asking question in robotic, ai sort of tone. “Hello, what is your name”? “ where are you from”? “How long have you lived in Miami”? “Do you like it here”? “Nice to meet you, Eric”. It felt like something out of a sci-fi movie, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. A week later I saw him walking down the street at a pretty fast pace with a gentleman in his mid 50s and they looked and dressed exactly the same. He looked right at me and kept walking.

        "text": "For context, when I was in high school I had 3 separate encounters with what I believe were spirits. This all took place during sophomore year, once in September, once around December/January, and again around March. \nDuring the first encounter me and a close friend of mine walked to a wooded area in my neighborhood about 5 minutes from my house. The woods were right next to a large field that was the backyard of my childhood best friend, so I was rather familiar with the area. When we walked into the field we saw three diamond like white figures, I’d say about two or three feet tall, hovering off the ground and running around each other in circles. They seemed to be moving along a singular plane (there was no bobbing as if they had legs) in a playful manner. We both stopped when we saw them, and as if they were startled, they stopped too and then darted into the woods. We thought it was some sort of animal at first but after putting the pieces  together we couldn’t tell. After lots of speculation we were still unable to decipher what we had seen so we decided to go to the field the next day to find nothing there. \nFast forward a few months, I had become close friends with someone else who lived along the field. One day we spent the day in the cemetery(which is attached to the same creek that leads to the field) as teenagers do. Later that day we were skating at the park around dusk and as we were walking home we saw them again, in the same field, doing the same thing, but this time there was more of them. My friend immediately knew what they were as I had told her the story a thousand times.\nA few more months passed and I was hanging out with my childhood best friend (the one who’s house is attached to the field) again in the cemetery. I was telling them about the spirits who my friends and I had deemed “the little men”. We talked about them for a while until we arrived at an area in the cemetery titled “baby land”. Next to baby land was a path that went up a hill and into the woods. We were about to walk up the path but as we turned the corner a group of about 10 of them charged straight at us. We yelled in panic and turned to run but after we turned back they were gone. This was the first encounter that happened during the day and what convinced me that what I had been seeing was real.\nI am now a sophomore in college and I’m visiting my home town for spring break. I was hanging out with the 2 friends from the first two encounters and we were discussing how bizarre it all was. We decided we wanted to see them again and are going to go to the cemetery and the field in a few days to see if we find anything.\nI’m scared that if I seek out their presence again I will be inviting them into my life and am terrified of what it might lead to. On the other hand I’m very curious and would like to see them again to verify what happened in the past.\nI apologize for the long post and any typos as it’s late and I want to go to bed. I don’t know what to do, any advice would be appreciated.",

        "text": "This strange thing happens to me whenever I travel somewhere and it's a little bizarre. Anytime I go to a new city or location, some bad thing happens out of nowhere either moments after I leave or within a couple days.\n\nSome examples are\n\n* March, 2011 Toulouse, France shooting. First one I really remember, I was on vacation with my family. The first attack(?) was a day after I left.\n* June 3, 2017 London Bridge car attacks. Another vacation, this one happened while I was in London.\n* December 11, 2018 Strasburg, France terror attacks. My last trip to Europe concluded in Strasburg a day before this attack.\n* December 21, 2019 Columbo, Sri Lanka. I had meetings with the President of Sri Lanka and a few of his friends/officials. Three years later his entire country collapses. This one stands against the mold, but still weird.\n* December 11, 2021 Louisville, Kentucky. Stopped here on the 9th and then two days later there were some horrible tornadoes. \n* May 19, 2022 St Louis. I arrived on the 10th, spent a day in St. Louis, perfect weather. The next day isolated tornadoes right as I cross state lines.\n* May 22, 2022 Yellowstone National Park. I visited in June and there was a freak snowstorm that shut down the entire north of the park. Later, during the snowmelt, the entire northern section of the park was flooded and parts of it destroyed.\n* May 25, 2022 Las Vegas. Massive droughts but days after I visit and leave they get rains that flood the Vegas Strip and cause a good amount of water damage.\n* November 6, 2022 Akron, Ohio. This one doesn't quite fit either but thought I would include it. Stayed in Akron, Ohio to visit and ended up driving into East Palestine, stopped there and remember thinking how funky the name was. This was months before the train incident.\n* December 13, 2022 New Orleans. Stay in New Orleans over the 13th and leave early the 14th. Later that day tornadoes strike New Orleans.\n* February 12, 2023 Philadelphia. I planned this trip to Philly right after I got back from New Orleans, then the Eagles moved in to play in the Super Bowl. I was on the streets as the fans began to riot after the Eagles lost.\n\nWhat's odd is nothing terribly tragic ever seems to happen to me. I get my fair share of inconvenience, but when compared to everyone around me I am the luckiest guy ever. Possibly unrelated is I get this urge to travel, like an itch that I can only scratch with going places. \n\nI want to say this is weird pattern is not the rule. I've gone to plenty of other places and things be totally normal. But I have also likely forgotten a few instances where this pattern occurred. I also want to say I am seeing patterns when there aren't any. However, I can't help but to think I am cursed or bring misfortune in some way. It's really weird.",

        "text": "Let me set the scenario before I describe what happened:\n\nI'm visiting my sister and sleeping in their only spare bedroom because her two kids have the other room. These bedrooms are upstairs. My sister and her husband sleep in the only bedroom on the first floor. There is a sliding window in my bedroom and it was closed during what happened to me. It was around 7 PM when my three and two year old nephews were playing those push toys on the downstairs hardwood floor. I was upstairs in my bedroom playing my Nintendo Switch at the foot of the bed that's near the door to the upstairs hallway. Because of the kids noise I shut my door to limit the noise. \n\nMaybe ten to fifteen minutes later I heard my two year old make a yelp which made me realize my sister is putting him to bed. He's still at the age where he sleeps in a crib and my sister shuts her kids doors when they go to bed. The lights in the bathroom, hallway, three year old nephew's bedroom, and my bedroom had their lights on. \n\nThis is what happened:\n\nAs I said before I was playing my switch and then there was this constant banging on the door. I immediately thought that she was mad that the tv volume was too loud or that something is wrong. I jump from the bed and open the door. No one was there.\n\nIn a split second I started panicking and ran for the stairs. The stairs are halfway across from the living room downstairs where I saw my sister with her hands around my three year old nephew as they watched a kids show. I asked her \"Where you knocking on my door?\" and she replied with some worried look on her face and said \"No, I didn't\"\n\nWhat do I make out of all of this?:\n\nI can't think of an explanation for what happened. I never suspected my two year old nephew stuck in his crib escaping, opening the door, and knocking and rushing back inside. The amount of time it took me to open the door was a few seconds and I would have caught him rushing back to his room. \n\nThere is no history of any terrible events happening at my sister's house. No one died there. There were no murders there. I know because my sister's house is the house I grew up in and it was a new construction home. I'm baffled by what happened but weirdly I got a thrill out of it.",

        "text": "When I was around 11 my father and I moved from Spain to Germany into an apartment (I still live in it) that previously belonged to an old man who apparently died in his sleep. I only learned this later though. In my room there was a huge pitch black shadow in the corner at night. My room did feel eery, but I thought it was due to my feelings, I was kind of depressed at that time due to moving from a different country and other things. But it took some months or years that I started to wonder why that shadow was there in the first place. Nothing in my room could’ve casted that kind of deep black shadow in only one corner of the room. One day, after showering, I entered my room only to see a bright flash of light from the corner into the room. It was really brief but scared me so much I slept on the couch in the living room that night. After that the shadow was gone forever. My father has passed since then, I have been living here for almost 16 years and I never saw that black shadow again nor did the room feel eery anymore. Makes me wonder if that old man died right there and his spirit didn’t leave until that one night.   \n\n\non a funny note, I wonder if he was creeped out about the 2000ˋs angsty teenager I was, being messy and horny and what not, and decided enough is enough haha.",

We walked around the block and like normal we cut up the alley way near my home. As we were walking the motion censor light that my neighbors had installed kicked on. As we got closer to my home Link turned around and put himself between me and something. I turned around and squinted looking down the alley way and I saw a man just standing there. I couldn’t make out any features and he was dark, as dark as the night around him. I yelled at him asking if he needed something and no response. At this point Link is in full guard mode growling and snarling at the guy. \n\nI pulled in links leash and tried to force him to move and he wouldn’t budge. After a moment the guy started coming towards us. Once again I spoke up telling him to back off my dog will hurt him. He became faster, as he neared the light of my neighbors house it kicked on, and this guy seemed to absorb the light. No face, no hair, nothing. And as he stepped to where link could get him he vanished. Link turned tail and ram to our front door and we went inside. I stayed up that whole night watching and listening.\n\nThe next morning I removed waking up and going to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I heard my grandma plain as day day my name. I called her and asked if she was ok and she was happy to hear from me but assured me she is ok. \n\nAbout two months later she passed away. Congestive heart failure.\nThe very next year around the anniversary of her death Link died from kidney failure.\nThe year after my cousin died of suicide.\n\nWhat makes me think this was to tell me they were going to pass is that not only was I with link that night but when this thing disappeared it was right level with the garage door of my neighbors which is how my cousin hung himself.",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI just joined Reddit to seek some help/guidance. **My boyfriend has been seeing 'shadow people' at night for a few years, only when he was sleeping alone**. It began when he was dating his ex-girlfriend who's parents hated him, and he said her mothers eyes were the darkest black and most negative thing he's ever felt. This happened when he was protecting his ex from her and her father beating his ex up (he still has the scars from her mothers nails on his arm). His ex and her parents are from a country in eastern Europe and moved to America about 15 years ago. My boyfriend has alluded to thinking that perhaps they had placed a hex/curse on him. He would see the shadow people whenever he was sleeping alone. **They would run at the bed seeming very angry, they would be wielding an axe at his head, this would repeat**.On some occasions kicking at him. There were also times when it was multiple of them. One throwing an axe at a wall , the other running at him etc. \n\nThis has continued into us dating for the past 8 months. He has traveled for work and one time he came home and said,\"guess who showed up in Indiana\". **Therefore, they have followed him to locations other than our house- to a different state.** We haven't spoke of them in a while because he has stopped traveling for work. We haven't slept in different beds for 2 months now. This morning, the shadow people came up in conversation, and I said, \"well you haven't seen them in a long time\". He said, \"OH, YES I HAVE!\", I was shocked. The shadow person/people have been making a pretty frequent visit in the night. **Previously, they would only visit when my boyfriend was sleeping alone, now, they have escalated to trying to chop my boyfriend's head off with a shadow axe while I am sleeping next to him.**\n\nI am no longer really scared of the idea of their prescience, but rather determined to replace whatever negative energy my boyfriend is seemingly resonating with positive energy/light. **I think we can all agree they obviously aren't a GOOD sign.**\n\nWhy would they repeat behavior just to try to scare him? He ignores them, all he does is roll over and go back to sleep. \n\nIf you have had an experience with a relentless shadow person visitor, how was it similar and how did you resolve it?\n\nI used to have some crystals in the corners of the room, but they were picked up probably 6 months ago. I have contemplated sage-ing the house.\n\nDoes anyone think this may be the result of black magic/ a hex/a curse?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\n\\-K",

Then weird noises started every one in a while like heavy footsteps in the kitchen, I once genuinely thought someone was in the kitchen because the footsteps were quite loud and it felt like someone was there. Sometimes I suddenly felt a presence near me or felt cold air near my hand or face despite there being no air flow and it was only one area.\n\nWe have a camera in the house and I often look at it. Many times I noticed weird flying orbs that would be there, move a bit then dissappear. \n\nRecently my camera caught a weird noise which could not be explained by anything like the sounds of appliances or my dogs, no one was home, my dogs don't sound like that or make that noise and none of my appliances make noises, the sound is attached to this.\n\nI often hear sounds of something cracking at night, and I heard that yesterday. I also kept seeing small things or like dark spots move in the sides of my vision. After a while I suddenly felt a weird smell near me like rotten eggs for about 10-20 seconds which also cannot be explained by anything, then it went away.\n\nCan someone please help me or tell me what all this is? Is it a ghost or something else? If so what does it want?\n\nFor the video sound please go into my posts",
