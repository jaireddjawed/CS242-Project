        "text": "Sensitive topic, so please stick very closely to the precise question at hand. Thanks!\n\nI have an example similar to the following:\n\n'The group had no racialized members.'\n\nwhere 'racialized' is being used not to mean 'treated as a member of a certain group' (subject to stereotyping, essentialism, etc.) but simply as 'member of a certain group (one that is commonly racialized)'\n\nHas anyone come across this usage before? My research suggests the language of 'racialization' is particularly widespread in Canada, but still, all the examples I find seem to use it in the way I am familiar with and not as a label equivalent to 'member of a racialized group'.\n\nI would be slightly put out, for instance, if I read that 'we employ many racialized people'.\n\nAm I being too fussy here? Is 'racialized' taking on the meaning of 'non-white' so that soon we can expect to hear sentences like 'I'm really glad my daughter has so many racialized friends'? \n\nI'm working with non-native speakers, writing for an international, academic audience, and I'm keen to avoid overstepping the bounds of my competency. It's hard to apply usage norms in areas like this where usage is changing. Hence my inquiry.\n\nMy feeling was to suggest something like 'none of the group members belonged to racialized minorities'. But there's a part of me that thinks that this might be unjustified, and that the context makes clear in a statement like 'none of the participants were racialized' what the intended meaning is, and that I am being too literal. \n\nAppreciate any feedback üôÇ",

        "text": "Hi, our class have gotten this assignment, and most of us are struggling with it. So I have a few questions about verb phrases in this task. \n\n1\n\nIn this sentence, I am unsure if \"never mind\" becomes the whole verb phrase or just \"mind\": \n\n‚ÄúHush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head‚Äôs bare,\n\nI also have the same issue with \"left behind\" and \"rise upon\". I know that sometimes other word classes can become a part of a verb phrase, but I am unsure if this is the case for these.\n\n2\n\nI am also very unsure about the tense in \"cannot spoil\", \"would be\", and \"would have\". One of my friends said that \"would be\" and \"would have\" do not have tense.\n\n3\n\nIs \"was shaved\" past perfective? It has \"was\" as a modal verb.\n\n4\n\nAre \"curled\", \"was\" and \"said\" all finite verbs in this sentence? Also, is \"was shaved\" passive in this sentence? I know that \"curled\" and \"said\" are both active\n\nThat **curled** like a lamb‚Äôs back, **was shaved**, so I **said**,",
