The villains almost always get their karmic comeuppance, the sympathetic protagonists\n(if they stick with it and suffer the slings and arrows of fate) get inevitably rewarded.\n\nJust a few examples: The protagonist of *Nosedive* leaves\nher shallow life behind and begins a new, more fulfilling one. The pedophile from *Shut up and Dance* gets exposed and arrested.\nThe interrogator from *White Christmas* is cut off from society. The hacker from *Hated in the Nation* is tracked down and caught.\nThe programmer from *USS Callister* is left helpless in his own game, and the simulated characters get an entire universe to explore. The mind-rapey helicopter mom gets beaten up and loses the very thing she tried to protect.\nThe murdering lady from *Crocodile* gets exposed by hamster ex machina.\n\nThis is all too fair somehow, and life, as we all know, isn't fair, or an Aesop fable, or a  Hollywood movie. I think the message of the series would have been more poignant if all those scenarios didn't end in karmic justice. Thoughts?",

        "text": "5 episodes with full brain simulation and no AIs. Their concept of having helpful intelligence is apparently to use brainwashed slaves. However they can simulate them so fast that one second seems to be around 4 days (at the end of \"White Christmas\", \"Hang the DJ\" doesn't count as it might be on server), on small low power device, what means they are accelerated around 345600 times. Your virtual copy would do all your intelectual jobs of your whole life in fifteen minutes. I can't even imagine what full-fledged Artificial General Intelligence would be able to do with that kind of power. \n\nWhy anyone dies or has to work in that world? Why isn't that world inhabited only by beautiful, forever young people with bones made out of carbon nanotubes? One year aka 345600 years of research of the copies of the brightest brains of humanity should be enough to solve most of the world's problems. Also, they would invent AGI quite fast, probably in like half an hour or so.\n\nTL;DR: **What the hell** 10 YFLOPS supercomputers basically lying on the streets and this world looks like that?",

Almost all episodes felt like they could be their own show or movie. And what a powerful way to end season 4, holy shit. It tied so many things together, and you felt the pleasure she (or they) got from the revenge. From music, to worldbuilding, this show has it all.\n\nMy favorite episodes:\n\n- Fifteen Million Merits, good from beginning to end, probably one of the best stories Black Mirror had to give. Loved the speech in the episode.\n\n- Nosedive, beautiful aesthetics and BDH really nailed the performance of Lacie, especially the speech at the end.\n\n- San Junipero, loved the setting of this one, and also a great story to go with it. I would totally want to live in that world.\n\n\n",
