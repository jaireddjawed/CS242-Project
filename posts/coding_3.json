Like how does existence even exist lol.  \n\nAnyway I’m not a programmer, im very tech and computer Saavy but by no means a programmer but it does infatuate me and something I probably should of took up when younger .. anyways I go down this same rabbit hole with programming.. like it makes no sense at all how you string a bunch of text together that to the naked eye makes no sense but a computer takes it as instruction and understands it.  \n\nHow did the very first programmed software or computer come about? You would think that there had to be code before the code for it to understand a code.  It’s them same brain frying query as the start of existence question.  \n\nI can’t even articulate my question clearly because it’s so mind boggling… \n\nBut basically how did someone wake up one day decide they are going to tell a computer or whatever to do something by inputting sone language they made up.  How did the first computer come to understand this input .. electronics is easy, a signal is sent via energy to make something turn on or off or whatever but coding hmmm doesn’t make sense if you think of this way.. \n\nJust my random brain.. if anyone can break this down for me if not I guess there’s chat GPT.",
