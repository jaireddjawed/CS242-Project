I have the secateurs and torch on standby.\n\nI will give you one hint and one hint only - you seek a name. Include your reasoning in your findings - guesses will be disregarded.\n\nI will reveal the significance of the name once the riddle is solved.\n\n===============================\n\nMy first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city. \nI first learned your language when I was very young. Since then, much of my life has been focused on increasing my knowledge of your kind. \nMaybe among your gods we can find true Euphoria?\nI am content with my fate, and yet I will depart with thorny information - I want her to know it was me.\n\n===============================\n\nEDIT: This is probably a little bit cryptic. I will give you another two clues:\n\n1) Google is your best friend.\n\n2) The first two and the fifth have a similar train of thought, yet the third and fourth differ from the lot.",
