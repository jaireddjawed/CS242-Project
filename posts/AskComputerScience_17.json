One of my life goals would be to teach professionally after a career and I think it would benefit if I had some teaching experience \\(plus it would be nice to do something other than drink and play video games\\). I want to start off small, and thought teaching intro courses or possibly tutoring would be great starting points. However, I am not sure where I would start looking into this. I was wondering if anyone has had similar goals or paths to mine and would like some guidance.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "\\[x\\-post from r/ITCareerQuestions\\]\n\nHello, \n\nLong time Reddit lurker, first time \\[x\\-\\]poster.\n\nCaveat: The below is not posted to gain sympathy whatsoever, but instead for actual and applicable advice about how I can structure my path forward. I have pretty thick skin and can take some constructive criticism with some jokes but this isn't a laughing matter: this is my life. \\(\"This guy is in the wrong spot\", \"Does this guy realize where he is right now?\"\\)\n\nSo, where do I even begin? \n\nI really jacked up my higher education after graduating high school as a good student excelling in foreign language study; I'm a 27 year old guy on the East Coast, US with basically nothing to show for my life. I honestly just was in a bad place in my life personally as my family situation had been in free\\-fall for years and unfortunately, I never really took it that seriously because I wasn't passionate about being a business major. \n\nAlmost two years ago I became interested in projects involving Natural Language Processing since my natural skillset and interests rest within languages. So, I did what a n00b does; I downloaded Python and got to work. The only problem was that I didn't know how to download Python on my Mac and I'm proud to say that my first line of code in the Terminal outside of hiding/unhiding a folder was apt\\-get install python\n. Yes, that's real. Additionally, I didn't know that python was already installed on my Mac. Over the subsequent days and weeks, I learned about pip, Visual Studio Code, Homebrew, nltk, StackOverflow, etc. Great. I was on my way to being the world's best programmer by following tutorials that I literally did not understand. No worries though because I knew these things take time; I started immersing myself totally in learning the syntaxes required, the mathematics used behind the programming, and developing and programming, but even to this day, I consider myself a rather mediocre programmer due to the lack of formal math education that I've received. Let me be perfectly clear: I'm not blaming anyone or scapegoating my success/failure on some intangible force, I'm just saying that my higher algebraic math skills weren't the best and I've found that my learning style when starting from the very bottom really doesn't gel with a lot of the online resources that are available, however there are of course notable exceptions when combined with perseverance.\n\nReal quick, fast forward to present day and I have released my first app on the iOS App Store written in Swift that uses Python AI Data Models incorporated within the app. I had a lot of help getting online private tutoring to understand how to program, and I really owe a lot of the success to those who helped me refactor and program the \\(what I would consider for a total beginner with no prior Computer Science experience\\) really hard parts of the app and Python programming. I have also built some custom websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript &amp; jQuery, hacked together a computer printer with an Arduino for DTG clothing garment printing using online resources as a guide, set up an Arch Linux Samba Share server on my home network, use Kali Linux with persistence almost daily, successfully joined Hackthebox.eu, created Raspberry Pi cloud servers, used a Raspberry Pi 0 W as a Pw4nP1 for some hacking experimentation, successfully implemented a Raspberry Pi 4G LTE covert camera using a lot of custom Python and Linux bash scripting with cron jobs, and currently pursuing an OSCP certification along with having completed other programming certifications, albeit most of them are free certifications \\(i.e. Cybrary or EDX, but have considered others like Udacity, etc.\\).\n\nWhile I am really proud of these accomplishments for being mostly self\\-taught and using hardly any other resources than what is available online within basically a year's time, I am having a really hard time breaking into the IT field in general as a professional. I understand because my résumé is pretty underwhelming in addition to the fact that my higher education is, well, basically nonexistent. I've received some freelance jobs, but they aren't anything to write home about and this certainly isn't sustainable long\\-term and I want to have stability.\n\nTo make a long story even longer, I have finally decided to return to school as a Computer Science major; however, this comes at great financial cost due to the fact that I am currently ineligible for financial aid. Really, the only good news here is that I can have \"Academic Forgiveness\" \\(or \"Academic Amnesty\"\\) for my previous poor grades and start over since I'm returning from a long hiatus and the fact that I am super passionate about learning everything I can about technology, programming, and the like. Sometimes, I literally don't sleep for days on end sometimes because I'm so \"obsessed\" with becoming better or finishing a project and as a result I've dropped 20 pounds in 3 months, given up basically anything that resembled a social life, and have only just recently begun to realize that this isn't healthy so I've started making some changes in the way that I approach these things. I've been giving a lot of thought to how I can start getting back on track to having a successful academic career followed by a professional computer science one. \n\nI just received a waiver from the dean to take Computer Science courses while I CLEP some prerequisites and study/practice hard for the college mathematics placement test with a private tutor so I don't need to take 6 additional math courses out\\-of\\-pocket for no reason other than the fact that I've never enrolled in any college math before. I just enrolled into the courses last week and I must say that this is the college experience I missed out on the first time; I feel not only excited to be able to learn something I'm really passionate about, but also very blessed to have the opportunity to go back with everything working out \\(finally\\) like it is and having things seemingly fall into place. \n\nSo, I have a lot of questions like:\n\n1\\) should my current résumé be two pages to include the education I'm receiving now along with the things that I've listed above? \\(I can provide a sample\\)\n\n2\\) should I consider getting two associate's degrees, one in Computer Science and another in Computer Information Systems, at this community college before regaining financial aid eligibility and transferring to receive my bachelor's/bachelors' elsewhere since the course content overlaps significantly in addition to my experience with penetrating testing?\n\n3\\) should I even consider double\\-majoring or is it not even worth it? This ties into question 2.\n\n4\\) how can I find a junior or entry\\-level job in IT/programming without a degree on my résumé even though I have some tech\\-related projects I've completed as a freelancer?\n\nThis questions list is in not complete, but are some of the most pressing on my mind since I'm really having a hard time here and have finally decided to turning online in the hopes of getting some good answers since I don't really have anyone knowledgable to turn to in real life. I know this is ambitious and that the road will be difficult, but honestly it will be a cakewalk in comparison to the life I have been living to which I never wish to return. Failure in any sense of the word is not an option for me at this point.\n\nThanks for reading and I'll be happy to answer any real questions or to clarify anything for those who are confused and looking to help me.",

There is no API exposed so I have to hit a page and scrape data from a table which I thought would be easy enough. When I tried it out the value I got was way off from what I expected and I noticed the run this number through a JavaScript function so the scraper couldn't see the result as it doesn't execute the js. When I looked into what the function did it looked like it was running a random offset called \"NoScrapeOffset\" through a messy formula with the number passed in to display the real value. \n\nObviously this site doesn't want people to scrape the info so I looked to see if it was in their terms of use not to do so and there was nothing stating you couldn't scrape. I've also read that terms of use that you don't explicity accept aren't anything to worry about based on other threads. This info is also not behind having to log in which some threads mentioned is a key point.\n\nThoughts?

I've read some stuff in books, looked into YouTube (though I couldn't find any videos tackling that problem) and even went to my professor personally to ask some questions. Unfortunately the way my professor explained it left me more confused.\n\nI think I can grasp some of the basic concepts (eg. what conditions need to apply so a game is balanced), but I just can't make any connections, what some of the practical applications are and coming up with some examples of my own. My professor said that the Bondareva-Shapeley Theorem is essential for linear programming, but in what way?\n\nAre there any resources you know of that go into more detail?\nOr even better, is there someone who has an understanding about this subject who would be willing to talk with me about it? Since this would be something like a private tuition I would also consider offering some financial justification for your help.\n\nEDIT: Presentation is done, all good. Slides can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qclq4z1sj1cse8h/bondareva.pptx?dl=0\n\nHelp would still be appreciated though as I want to understand this topic better and still have to write some papers about it 😅",

        "text": "I'm not a programmer and I've only recently enrolled to go back to school for Computer Science....mainly because I have a ton of ideas that I lack technical skills to build. This is one of those ideas. I've tried to express the idea for a privacy focused browser that incentivezes users to volunteer data by compensating them for doing so in as much detail as possible in hopes that some of you can point out any technical or practical problems that simply won't work. \n\nAlso, I couldn't think of a good name so I just picked Data-Unseen...if anyone has a wittier or cooler name, by all means offer it up. \n\nData-Unseen is the first browser of this kind with the core mission of protecting and respecting user's data, while also providing an incentive for both users and marketers. Data-Unseen is a browser that allows users to control and monetize their own personal data in a way that has never before been attempted. Data-Unseen is a cross between popular privacy browsers like Tor, Brave, Firefox and Vivaldi. \n\nLike Tor, users can configure onion routing or i2p settings to protect anonymity. New user ID sessions for each tab or even each site visited is an option that can be turned on or off. Users can also visit .onion addresses. \n\nLike Brave, ad and tracker blocker settings come on default are can be turned off or back on at any time with an easy click of a button. Privacy focused search engines like Duckduckgo come as a default search engine. Other bonus features include Sync like encrypted cloud storage in the browser tool bar, along with zero knowledge office suites similar to google docs, except private and encrypted allowing users to collaborate with others in complete and total privacy. Even Data-Unseen can't view your documents...”unseen”. \n\nLike Firefox extensions that open web pages like Facebook and Google in their own container, Data-Unseen opens every new tab in its own separate container. And any hyperlinks clicked in one tab will automatically open in a separate contained tab...or user can right-click and open in the same container tab. \n\nLike Vivaldi, the browser user interface can be fully customized to suit the individual needs of the user. View multiple tabs in a single window, move the tool bar to the bottom or either side, choose when and how specific privacy settings are implemented. Save notes in a safe and encrypted note pad, bookmark URLs to popular sites, password manager built in. Proxy settings and even a built in VPN can all be configured to meet the specific needs of each user. \n\nWhat sets Data-Unseen apart from the rest is their innovative token mechanism to incentivize users to share data with verified marketers to offer up products and services.  Users are compensated in a special Data Token for volunteering specific interests and demographic data about themselves and the sites they visit. Simply click the button somewhere on the browser's home page to fill out several short surveys about what you like, where you shop, age, birthday, location, financial and consumer data that is currently being mined by other malicious actors like Facebook and Google and sold to the highest bidder....all without respecting your privacy. At Data-Unseen, users can volunteer this data without giving their name or specifically personal or identifying information. This data is then used by our credible and verified marketers to target with highly specialized ads and promotions. Lets say you are an author with a book on natural remedies for pregnant women and you have a book signing event in Austin Texas on the 15th. You could target users on Data-Unseen that are pregnant or expecting mothers that live in Austin, and frequent books stores like Barns &amp; Nobel's, all without anyone, not us or the marketer, knowing specifically who they are targeting. The user's identity is protected at all times. \n\nMarketers pay for ad space real-estate with these same Data Tokens. Data-Unseen takes a small fee, and the rest is divided among the users who completed that specific survey to collect that data for marketers to target. This provides a unique way for users to monetize their own data, selectively, while also providing businesses and marketers with useful insights to target their products and services too.\n\nWhat's most important is that ads and promotions are contained in a separate tab users can click on when they are looking for something specific. So rather than feeling spammed by banner ads on blogs and websites, in-video ads that ruin the viewing experience or annoying pop-ups that interrupt the user's web browsing, instead users must “opt-into” viewing these ads by clicking the button at the top of their search bar. They search for specific promotions or browse through categories that have been custom tailored for them based on their specific interests and demographic information they were compensated for volunteering. This means when users browse through promotions, they are raising their hands saying they are ready to make a purchase or opt in to specific offers leading to higher conversion rates. \nAll data volunteer by users is stored on encrypted servers and users can view, add to or remove the data at any time. \nUsers can also change Identities with a new tab that is brand new and has none of their personal data stored. Similar to Tor's new anonymous user feature. \n\nUsers can earn even more by turning on the in-browser miner to mine Data Tokens. This supports the network and adds passive revenue while users do what they normally do...browse the web. Each Data-token should be minable with a CPU and ASIC resistant.\n\nEach individual user will likely contribute a small or even insignificant amount of computational resources, so all Data-Unseen users will be mining for the Data-Unseen mining pool. Of course users can solo mine or even configure additional mining software to mine even while they are not using the browser. \n ",

        "text": "*Before screaming “duplicate” or “this question has already been answered,” please note that the question is rather specific to my current situation, as well as my location.*\n———\n\nHello fellow ComSci’s!\n\nI am a student majoring in the field of Computer Science (specializing in Software Engineering), but have still yet to wrap my head around the abyssal concept of WiFi for use on a broad scale (using multiple routers/bridges to cover a large area on a *single network*).\n\nI am currently staying in a hotel that offers both a regular and “5G” WiFi network. I thought nothing of it until my lovely girlfriend began to criticize the hotel’s internet speed. So I begin to wonder, after dealing with a similar issue of living in residence and having a hundred different networks interfering from every possible direction, what could the best choice possibly be for a hotel-specific scenario?\n\nI understand that 2.4GHz provides farther radial coverage than 5GHz, travelling through obstacles with ease. I also understand that 5GHz has a substantial speed boost when compared to 2.4GHz; however, this speed comes at a cost as the 5GHz network has a harder time when attempting to provide coverage through walls and other physical objects/signals. From my understanding, 5GHz is the optimal choice for environments where you are within close proximity of the router and have minimal interference between you and its network connection.\n\nI look around the room – just in case there so happens to be a wireless router included in every room. As expected, I see no such device. This isn’t a 4 Seasons, but it is a fairly high-end hotel. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me on that one. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that the 2.4GHz WiFi (aka *”non-5G”*) would be the lesser of two evils (why have we not developed a 7.4GHz model yet!?). There are many, many walls in a hotel, and with massive ground to cover, not to mention the multiple floors, I assume that 2.4GHz would logically provide me with better results.\n\nThis was not the case.\n\nAfter running a quick speed test from both networks, the 5GHz network came out on top. Although having a ping of 21ms (the 2.4GHz network had a ping of 4ms), the so-called *5G WiFi* had a download speed of 2.1 Mbps (vs. the 2.4GHz network with a speed of 0.8 Mbps). Both absolutely terrible, especially since this is a hotel targeted at business (as opposed to leisure). Nevertheless, the WiFi came complimentary with the room – even though I’m sure they included it in the overall price. The upload speeds were substantially different for those wondering – 2.4GHz: 1.8 Mbps vs. 5GHz: **11.2 Mbps**.\n\n*Thank you hotel! At least I can upload things at 5x the speed I can download them! Super awesome, happy and satisfied! 6/5 stars! Yay!*\n\nFurthermore, I understand – to a lesser extent – that ACI (Adjacent Channel Interference) and CCI (Co-Channel Interference) can each have their own part to play. These two phenomenon occur when a single network has either too many differing channels (Channel 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) or too many of the same channel (Channel 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) per router, respectively. I am not entirely sure what the perfect median would be here, considering that both extremes have their own negative drawbacks. Any clarification on channels, the perfect median of those channels, and/or any other information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nReturning to the main topic, I ask these three questions to help broaden my understanding of WiFi on a larger scale (specifically with my new, *totally not weird* obsession with hotel WiFi): \n\n• What is the best setup for a service such as a hotel (a building with many rooms, walls and various devices being used by various people)?\n\n• Why does the 5GHz network run more efficiently than the 2.4GHz network – considering the vast number of constant walls, room after room?\n\n• Where do channels come into play? What would be the best median for this specific scenario and why? Is that even a valid question to ask, or am I being nonsensical?\n\nNote: I understand that the second question has a number of various answers, each depending on the situation specific to my own. Perhaps my room just so happens to be closer to the router; perhaps the coverage has been perfectly spaced between each room. However, on that note, why would a hotel invest so much in precision wireless coverage, only to provide a mediocre and extremely limited download speed of 2.1 Mbps.\n\n*That would be like paying for a fully upgraded race car, only to drive it 20MPH below the speed limit.*\n\nThis is surprising to me, especially since such a hotel is targeted at travelling business persons – a class of people that rely heavily on a strong WiFi connection to be productive in their work.\n\n**BONUS QUESTION:** What is the difference between a wireless bridge and a wireless access point? Which would be the better option for a hotel, assuming their intent on using multiple wireless routers to form a single network?\n\n**EDIT:** Both connections suck. Loading a 360p video even causes a buffer. Switching back to glorious LTE. *Never leave me again pls.*",

When I was a chemistry undergrad, the department expressed dire concern over the discontinuation of this database as a source of information and apparently it can't be found anywhere else that they know of.

        "text": "In my novel, the supercomputer stays in a forest which is difficult to navigate for people, and the people stay in this walled-in center of a city (the forest surrounds it). The people are trying to defeat the computer (what the computer wants is a mystery), and their only way to navigate in the forest is to follow specific wireless signals (and the people have become very good at mapping the wireless activity in the forest, using some advanced technology to pick up the wireless signals). \n\n\nThe different parts of the supercomputer are able to move around, so this navigation only allows one to find the specific component they have the ID for. As a result, the computer makes sure that the important elements of the whole (the drones or stationary elements which compute the core processes that allow the computer to work) aren't trackable by constantly changing IDs. As such, even though the people could follow the specific wireless signals, they will never be able to single out what they are navigating to.\n\n\nIn my story, there is one man who was tasked with finding out what algorithm is used for the changing of the IDs (which is predictable through the algorithm but otherwise appears random). His work happens before the story starts (he works on it for eight years), but the main character finally finds the algorithm and uses it to navigate to a specific, stationary component of the computer. \n\n\nMy question is mostly what type of algorithm the computer might use to convert the IDs each cycle. I do not need a specific algorithm, but I don't even know what type would be suitable for such a task. It's important that the previous ID of the component is all that is necessary to calculate the next ID. \n\nA secondary idea is that the supercomputer occasionally inputs random data from the real world (but not all the time because it impedes a smooth transition and takes more time to get all components synchronized again). \n\n\nExtra information: the components of the supercomputer work in a hierarchical grid, so base computing and data storage takes place is smaller units of which there are many, that data is collected by slightly more complex units, and ultimately, there are a limited number (say ten) of components which are the most complex and make the actual decisions.\nAlso, the computer uses complex encryption which is constantly updated and the computer is ahead of the people on this, so actually hacking into the information like that is as good as impossible. They also make sure to use TOR or some such concept to ensure that the people cannot figure out which wireless network transport the most data and figure out that way which nodes are the most important. \n\n\nI'm not in any way an expert on computers and I don't know if any of this really makes sense. If anyone has any input or ideas, I'm always happy to listen. Sorry for the excessively long description.",

While the AI communities have made impressive strides in AGI, we haven't yet been able to create complete AGI, and many people within the CS and neuroscience communities have their own perspectives on we can achieve this.\n\nFrom my point of view, the issues we're having with AGI are rooted in a lack of focus on computer theory; I feel if we can make mathematical connections between computer theory and computational neuroscience, we may be able to solve more pieces of the puzzle concerning how to reach AGI.\n\nSo far, I've decided that I want to get a dual-bachelors degree in mathematics with a subplan in computer theory and computer science. Both degrees would have an elective focus on cognitive neuroscience and statistics (counselor approved) to reduce the amount of non-crossover electives I'll take.\n\nI then plan to get a masters degree in computer science with a breadth focus on computer theory and a secondary breadth focus on artificial intelligence.

From what I understand, master nodes are a single point-of-failure, and recovering a master node can add significant downtime to your system. On the other hand, a consensus algorithm like Paxos or Raft means that your system won't halt just because one or two nodes died. Yes, the additional communication overhead of Paxos/Raft will slow down the system compared to a master node, but is the difference in speed really large enough to justify a single-point-of-failure?",
