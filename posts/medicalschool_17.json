So the point is----my top choice is a west coast program and the PD told me that the odds of getting accepted to an away are  **SIGNIFICANTLY (**he capitalized &amp; bolded in our email ) better if I apply on day 1 or 2 of the application opening and that a huge majority of their residents are people who did aways there. So knowing this I asked for a letter of rec back in early December to be prepared. The MD told me to write the letter and he would sign it and I did. But he hasn't signed it and I have been emailing the MD every two weeks since Christmas reminding him, and he keeps saying he'll get to it. I finally told him I need it by the 15th of this month, to which he said thanks for the reminder.  \n\nMy issue is the away application ended up opening a month earlier than the PD originally told me, so I don't have a clinical letter of rec to submit my application. But I do have a glowing research letter from my PI that I was planning on using for ERAS. I already emailed my the writer of my clinical letter explaining the situation but I don't trust him to come through by the end of tomorrow. **Should I just proceed by using my research letter of rec even though the VSLO app asks for a letter that can speak to my clinical abilities?**",

I‚Äôm at a school that is very supportive of families and has subsidized childcare through the school.\n\nOne option would be to have a baby during my fourth year. Our fourth year curriculum is 14 months long and I would try to time a month or two of being pregnant for my last third year rotations. That way I would have a few months off postpartum. However, step 2 and away rotations, interviews for residency, match day etc all seem pretty stressful and I‚Äôve heard horror stories of women going into preterm labor because of stress so I‚Äôm a bit worried about that.\n\n\nThe other option would be to take a research year and have the baby during that year. Many of my friends interested in more competitive specialties are doing this.  I‚Äôm imagining this would look better than a leave of absence, and would be less stressful especially if I found a good project. I would also have fewer exposures to disease radiation etc by not doing rotations while pregnant. This honestly sounds like it has few downsides to me but I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone taking a research year for pregnancy.\n\n\nWould love some insight even just from people who did a research year while not pregnant about if they think it‚Äôs feasible!

I have been following their website for a while, and it says that the process is through VSLO. The viewing for the audition should be up today (March 1st), and application to the audition begins April 15th. \n\nThe problem that I'm having is that the audition rotation is not anywhere on VSLO. I can't even find the program. I enter in the specialty I'm interested in, but when I try to enter the city or program name, it's not even an option on VSLO. Like, I can't even find the institution, let alone the audition they're offering. \n\nI tried to email them to check, but I just got an automated reply saying they receive too many emails to respond directly, so I'm not sure what to do at this point in time. \n\nI'm also a DO student, but their website says they accept students from any accredited AOA program in the US, so I don't think this is the issue?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated!",
