My teacher said, unironically, with no qualifying statements, that D-Day was the turning point against Germany. Not in the Western Front, but the entire European theatre. This was in AP World History, which is supposed to be, essentially, a college level course, since you could get college credits from it.\n\nSince I was a know-it all kid, I couldn't just let that go, so I raised my hand and said that Stalingrad was instead. I basically brought up how much men and material was lost in the East vs the West, and that Germany had been losing the war long before June 6th, 1944. She basically said \"I see your point, but D-Day was the turning point in Europe.\" Now, I assume this was just the answer on the test, so it was the answer we needed to know, but Germany was losing in 1944, D-Day or no. Why are teachers told to teach this? I could sort of understand if it was a US history course and they wanted to play up D-Day because it was America's big entrance in Europe, but this was WORLD history, so why the complete downplaying of Soviet involvement in the war?  \n\nHow many kids have been taught from a, supposedly, authoritative source that D-Day was the turning point in Europe? As a side note, the same teacher made no mention of Canadians, British, Poles, etc. at D-Day, and described it as an all American assault by omission.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8o27sb/what_if_communism_was_never_invented_apparently_a/",
        "text": "For those not in the know, AlternateHistoryHub is a Youtube channel that posts videos about, well, alternate histories. The videos are, for the most, well-researched enough for a short Youtube-friendly overview of a specific historical moment and the ramifications of it. You'll get a few errors here and there, and glossing over some nuances, but nothing really too bad.\n\nAt least, that describes the most recent videos. I stumbled upon [What if Communism was never invented?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP2k2rEMsRI) recently. It's from 2015, and definitely represents a portrait of the Alternate Historian as a young man.\n\nThere's quite a bit wrong with the video, including its analysis of Communism as an ideology in and of itself, but this is badhistory, not badpolitics, so I'll be sticking to criticizing the historical errors present.\n\nThe first slip occurs around 0:18, when the narrator says \"What if Communism was never invented? What if Karl Marx's ideas were simply never spread?\" The problem with this is that the ideology of Communism predates Karl Marx - or at least the label does. You don't have to look much further than the first line of the *Communist Manifesto* to figure that out: \"A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre is Communism\". That line wouldn't really make much sense if Marx himself invented Communism.\n\nThe next minute is just a brief rundown of Communism as an ideology and the history of it as a political system. At 1:16, however, the narrator states that \"Before the [Soviet Union], Marxists and Socialists had the same ideas.\" Ummm... no.\nConsidering Marx devoted around a quarter of the *Communist Manifesto* to talking shit about other socialists and why their ideas are trash (specifically Section III \"Socialist and Communist Literature\"), saying of 'Petty-Bourgeois Socialism': \n\n&gt; \"Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.\"\n\n... it would be pretty inaccurate to state that 'Marxists and Socialist had the same ideas.' Hell, that's not even getting into the squabbles that were had in later decades (which I admittedly don't know enough to comment on).\n\nAt 1:53 though, is where things really kick into gear:\n\n&gt; \"At the end of World War I, socialists fell into two main camps with the start of the Russian Revolution: The Bolsheviks, later called Communists, were those who believed in a violent revolution to bring about Communist paradise, and the Anti-Bolsheviks; those who believed Socialism could evolve naturally into European political systems through democracy. After World War I, the Bolsheviks distanced themselves from the Communists gained influence, all through elections and not revolution.\n\nHonestly I'm not even sure how to respond to this. While there was a notable split post-Russian Revolution - or rather, post Russian Civil War - about how Communists should react to the Bolsheviks taking power (with Noam Chomsky noting in a filmed Q&amp;A session in 1989 that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were [viewed as a deviation by most orthodox Marxists](https://youtu.be/yQsceZ9skQI?t=130) due to their vanguardist tactics, as opposed to a more spontaneous revolution), it wasn't as pronounced or stark as 'Bolshevik or Anti-Bolshevik.'\n\nFurthermore, the quote implies that it was only the Bolsheviks who advocated a violent revolution. While they did, as previously stated, believe in fomenting revolutions opportunistically, they were far from the only ones who supported it. Considering Marx wrote that \"The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself... not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons\", violent revolution was kinda a mainstay of most Marxist influenced forms of Communism.\n\nFinally, this one's probably just a writing error and not actual bad history, but the narrator says that the \"Bolsheviks distanced themselves from the Communists\", despite the fact that he previously just said the Bolsheviks *became* the Communists (which is also another thing, as Bolshevik and Communist aren't synonymous)\n\nMoving on from that, at 2:19, the narrator states \"Because of the actions of Mao and Stalin, socialists had to move away from Marx's ideas, which is why in European nations, socialist ideas blended in different variations with capitalist societies.\" Two things with this. First of all, socialists did not move away from Marx's ideas after Mao and Stalin, or at least not all of them. Many [remained supporters of their regimes, despite their violent actions](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/what-exactly-are-trots-and-tankies), although they were, and still are, routinely decried by other socialists who disagree with the actions of Stalin and Mao. After all, socialists are humans, not a hive-mind - they won't all have the same interpretations or beliefs.\n\nSecondly, the socialists that did move didn't move away from Marx's ideas - they moved away from Lenin's. Neil McInnes details in *The Western Marxists* that, in the aftermath of the Prague Spring, many European Communists migrated from the writings of Lenin to the writings of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who stressed that political change follows cultural change. This strain of Communist though became known as 'Eurocommunism'.\n\nThe next minute or so is a detail of the alternate history itself, which is obviously speculation that I can't really comment on. However, at 3:52, the narrator starts to dissect Fascism and its relationship to Communism.\n\nAt 3:55 the narrator states that \"Fascism actually has origins based on Marxism, and originally was a far-left movement, just like Communism.\" According to *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, while it is true that Fascism has its roots in leftist thinkers like Georges Sorel, it would be inaccurate to call its early phase a \"far-left movement\", as one of the key tenets of Fascism, as pointed out by Benito Mussolini in *The Doctrine of Fascism* is it being \"the emphatic negation of that doctrine which constituted the basis of... Marxism: the doctrine of historical materialism.\" Again, drawing from *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, while Fascism was more explicitly revolutionary in its early stages, it was never a 'far-left' movement.\n\nAt 4:01, the narrator continues by saying that \"Mussolini, after his rise to power, was heavily influenced by Marx.\" This makes no sense as - as previously stated - Mussolini's Fascism was based primarily on a rejection of Communism. *Fascism: A Very Short Introduction* covers how Mussolini rode the coattails of a Red Scare (*Biennio Rosso*, in Italian) to power. The narrator then digs his hole a little deeper at 4:05 by backing up his claim by saying \"Both [Mussolini and Marx] believed in a revolution against the capitalists by the working class.\" While many early Fascists did advocate revolution, Mussolini was not one of them. In fact, he would later turn his back on these early Fascists, spurning the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, to make his famous *Appeal to Brothers in Black Shirts*  and request so-called 'Fascists of the First Hour' to \"fight together\" with Communists \"for the realization of [some of the original Fascist beliefs].\" Furthermore, the claim about Mussolini being opposed to capitalists on behalf of the working class is just mind-boggling, as Mussolini himself pointed out in *The Doctrine of Fascism* that one of the reasons Fascism opposes Socialism is because the latter \"clings rigidly to class war.\"\n\nAt 4:36, the narrator takes a detour to the other side of the globe while still staying in the land of badhistory - for badhistory knows no borders - by claiming; \"In Asia, without Communism, China's nationalists would immediately take over after the fall of the Emperor.\" The problem with this is that, in our timeline, the nationalists *did* immediately take over after the fall of the Emperor... kind of. The nationalist Kuomintang held nominal power (**ETA: It has been pointed out to me that the Beiyang government held power before the Kuomintang, and were seen as legitimate**), [but most of the country was ruled by warlords](https://youtu.be/I5cl0GjPjy4?t=184) in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Qing Dynasty, as pointed out in the PBS documentary *China: A Century of Revolution*. The Communists wouldn't register on anyone's radar for a few more years in China.\n\nThe badchinesehistory continues at 4:46, where the narrator fleshes out his alternate history by saying that in this alternate timeline, \"China is able to successfully fight off Japan.\" That implies that China, you know, didn't successfully fight off Japan - which they did, as can be seen in the aforementioned documentary and the fact that China isn't ruled by Japan today.\n\nAfter that, the rest of the video is just more detailing of the alternate timeline.",

The idea that the Ancient Sumerians knew the earth was round and orbitted the sun.

In the Epic of Gilgamesh for example the sun almost catches up with Gilgamesh as it rises \\(Gilgamesh was walking through the cave where the sun rose\\).\n\nI care about this because Rogan has introduced the idea to rational people, such as Michael Shermer. Even Graham Hancock \\(an infamous bad historian\\(, should have known better, him being well acquainted with the excellent work of Sitchin debunker Michael Heiser, whose work on the Nephilim he quotes in his recent book.\n\nI wrote a blog post on this subject here:\n\n[https://riderontheclouds.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/no\\-joe\\-rogan\\-the\\-sumerians\\-didnt\\-know\\-the\\-earth\\-was\\-round\\-and\\-orbiting\\-the\\-sun/](https://riderontheclouds.wordpress.com/2018/05/31/no-joe-rogan-the-sumerians-didnt-know-the-earth-was-round-and-orbiting-the-sun/)\n\nEdit: I watched the podcast, whilst as I am no geologist, so I cannot speak to debunk it all, he makes a ridiculous claim that the Rongorongo script from Easter Island is a relic of an extremely ancient script derived from experiences of the effect coronal mass ejections from the sun when seen in the sky, in\\-spite of the fact that there is no evidence of these original inhabitants anywhere, and the fact that the script resembles animals recognisable to the inhabitants of Easter Island. See this post by  Jason Colavito:\n\n[http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/rongorongo\\-a\\-go\\-go\\-robert\\-schochs\\-12000\\-year\\-easter\\-island\\-delusion](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/rongorongo-a-go-go-robert-schochs-12000-year-easter-island-delusion)\n\nAlso he claims that the conspiracy to cover this ancient civilisation up is due to a nonexistent dogmatic adherence to whig history amongst archaeologists.",

        "text": "Today is my cakeday and this badhistory is rearing its head on a few subreddits, so I think it's time to call it out.\n\nThe sentiment is a popular one with John Taylor Gatto, author of *An Underground History of Education* (2000). On page 186, he asks the rhetorical question, \"Faced with the problem of dangerous educated adults, what could be more natural than a factory to produce safely stupefied children?\" He repeats this sentiment in virtually all of his writing and speeches. (Gatto provides no explicit citations for this claim and only loose connections to historical sources.)\n\nTed Dintersmith included a graphic in his book *What School Could Be: Insights and Inspiration from Teachers across America* (2018) that says the Committee of Ten in 1893 had the goal of training factory workers. (None of the Committee of Ten reports include mention of training workers.)\n\nIn *The End of Average* (2015), Todd Rose claims schools use bells to train students to be prepared to work in factories and in an ironic twist, cites Gatto as a source. (In Gatto's original text, he selectively quotes a superintendent's report about the use of bells to communicate with students spread across a large campus.)\n\nThe challenge with this particular bad history is that modern-day authors and readers look at modern schools and find similarities between modern factories. But alas, that's all there is to it. Factories work as an analogy - and in fact, education leaders in the 1900s - 1930s were fond of using scientific management with started in factories - but that's about it. Factories around the time of the spread of American public education simply didn't look like schools.\n\nThe rise of \"common\" (i.e. public) schools began in the 1840's and was basically focused on providing a broad education to as many children (mostly white, mostly boys) as possible, mostly in order to graduate good citizens. It would take nearly a century for schools to settle into the structure of grouping children by age for the first 6 or so years, then dividing the day shorter blocks focused on one area of content at a time for the second 6 years. The seeds for that evolution were planted in the 1840's, at a time when factories look nothing like we think of them today.\n\nAudrey Watters describes the badhistory myth of the factory model as \"[invented history](http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/25/factory-model)\" and numerous historians have written pieces explaining the problems with the myth. It's impossible to boil American education history down to a single timeline given the differences across the states and disparate impact on children from different genders, races, and ethnicities, but it is possible to say there's no evidence to support a claim schools were designed with the goal of training factory workers or were based on the design of factories.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8nfor8/steven_crowder_claims_hitler_was_a_liberal/",
        "text": "The man, the myth, the legend, conservative podcast host Steven Crowder is back on this sub! (Yay?)\n\nToday, we’re gonna be delving deep into why Hitler wasn’t actually a Liberal Socialist\n\nIf you want, take a looksie at Crowders video [here](https://youtu.be/VybWkpt_3Jo) to make sure I’m not misrepresenting him, or just watch this historical dumpster fire\n\n(0:53) Just a PSA to Steven, and everybody else out there, just because Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers Party doesn’t mean he was Socialist. If all political leaders were honest with their naming, North Korea wouldn’t be called the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Just because it’s in their name doesn’t make it true.\n\n(Crowder then talks some Bernie Sanders for a minute, I’m not gonna comment on that)\n\n(2:07) Crowder then talks about how Hitler promises employment for all, with innovative public works schemes. This in itself is not untrue. However, when you’re trying to depict someone as a Socialist, this is not a halfway decent argument. Crowder doesn’t even try to differentiate the public works schemes from, say, Roosevelt’s New Deal. As we can see with the New Deal, public works projects can exist, but the system of Capitalism is still preserved. Also, promising employment for all.....not Socialist. You’d be hard pressed to find even the most diehard capitalist leaders who aren’t promising more jobs, employment going up. I don’t know anyone who would classify Ronald Reagan as a Socialist, but here he is, saying “I'm not going to rest until every American who wants a job can find a job.” These things aren’t socialist, or even indicators of socialism.\n\n(2:10) Crowder says Hitler gave workers increased benefits. I wouldn’t call\n- Disbanding trade Unions\n- Inability to strike, negotiate wages, or leave job without government permission\nincreased benefits for workers\n\n(2:18) “Big Education” is not a Socialist ideal. Public education was set up in Germany before Hitler took power. Also, in reference to the daycare, I’m not sure what Crowder is talking about with these vague points. I think he’s mentioning [Lebensborn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn), but that was racially segregated, which doesn’t fit into the socialist ideals of equality for all and all that Jazz\n\n(2:28) WOAH WAIT WHAT!??? An 80% tax rate? I looked around for this statistic and I couldn’t find it. However, I do know that the top income tax rate in 1941 Germany was about 14%. Even during the war, in 1942, Americans and British citizens paid a higher percent tax rate then citizens of Nazi Germany.\n\n(2:29) oh boy, the old Nazi gun control theory half truth. Yes, the Nazis did have strict gun laws for Jews, and other undesirables of Nazi society, but compared to the Weimar Republic, the Nazis MASSIVELY loosened gun laws from the near complete ban in the Weimar Republic, which, according to some historians, prevented Hitler from seizing power in the attempted 1923 [Beer Hall Putsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch) coup\n\n(3:01) Crowder States Hitler used “mob rule”, or “direct democracy” to infringe upon the rights of Jews. The 1933 enabling act, which stated Hitlers cabinet could pass laws without legislative approval essentially gave Hitler dictatorial powers so he could not have to gain popular approval. Hitler was defeated in the German 1932 presidential elections by Paul von Hindenburg by a large margin, with less than 37% of the votes. In 1932 parliamentary elections, the Nazi party fared better, but were still unable to secure the majority of seats in the Reichstag, with their numbers almost equal to the combined numbers of the Social Democrat and Communist party. Basically, Hitlers endeavors into winning the public opinion failed, and he came to power not by winning the hearts of the mob, but by political maneuvering.\n\n(3:08) Crowder seems to be under the impression that the Jews were targeted specifically because they were the wealthy minority\n1) While Jews were heavily represented in the corporate networks of Germany (around 16% of the members involved were Jewish, while Jews made up less than 1% of the German population), this doesn’t seem to add up if Hitler was so dead set on demonizing the wealthy. If Jews were discriminated, and eventually killed that much based on economic standing (I say this because Crowder only mentions economic factors in reasons why anti-Jewish laws, and eventually the Holocaust, would occur) wouldn’t the wealthy non Jewish Germans be forced to suffer along with them?\n2) Crowder totally ignores all other anti-semitism in Europe at the time. He didn’t mention any of the progroms in Poland or the Russian Empire/Russian Civil War. Anti-Semitism has already been rooted in many Europeans, Hitler didn’t just come along and point out that Jews were disproportionately represented in the German upper class and this led to discriminatory laws and genocide.\n\nAlso, Crowder really doesn’t mention privatization under Nazi Germany. Previous assets that were held by the public were transferred to the private sector. In this regard, the Nazis were far less socialist then other capitalist countries, as none of them attempted to re-integrate state owned firms into the private sector. \n\nAlso, the comments section to the video consists of Holocaust Denial (if Jews were 1% of the population, how did six million die!!!1!1!1)and the “Jewish Bolshevism” theory. You’ve been warned.\n\nI’ve got a couple good reads if you want to delve deeper into why Nazi Germany was totally a Liberal Socialist state\n/s\n\nEconomist Germà Bel of the University of Barcelona going in depth on Nazi privatization: [Germà Bel privatization](http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf)\n\nAn analysis of Nazi taxation and economics published by the American Economic Association: [Taxes n’ stuff](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capitalisback/CountryData/Germany/Other/Pre1950Series/RefsHistoricalGermanAccounts/Lindholm47.pdf)\n\nBernard Harcourt on Nazi gun laws: [Guns guns guns!!!](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4029&amp;context=flr)\n\nPaul Windolf of University Trier on the Jewish economic elite and how the Nazi “Jews controlling the wealth” theory is BS in general: [Hitler would probably not want you to read this](https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb4/prof/SOZ/APO/WindolfMS577June10.pdf)",

Though he is correct that the historical battle involved Basques attacking the Franks it is not what the text accompanying the image in the book says.\n\nNow I went through the trouble of looking up the source for this image and we can all guess what I found\\(Hint its nothing like what is being claimed by the Afrocentrist.\\).\n\n[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84472995/f249.image.r=Grandes&amp;#37;20chroniques&amp;#37;20de&amp;#37;20France](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84472995/f249.image.r=Grandes%20chroniques%20de%20France)\n\nI also went through the trouble of getting a translation done of the text on the page.\n\n\"From the message about Ganelon and about the treachery he committed against King Marsile. Of the actualities that King Marsile and the Sarasins have, through malice, done to the king and to the combatants. And also of the battle, and how the Christians were slain.\n\nAfter Charlemagne, the very powerful and very renown, conquered all of Galica and submitted to the Christian faith, for the honor of God and of Monseignor Saint\\-Jaques, he returned to France, and had his hosts stay in Pamplona. In this time, staying in the city of Sarrogoce were two Sarasin kings, Marsile and his brother Baligans. If only the sultan of Babilonne had been sent against Charlemaines to defend Spain with the groups from Surie and the great hosts. To the emperor they submitted and seemingly obeyed him by their own volition, but it was an act, because they dared not refuse his commands. King Charlemagne, who wanted not that they stay thus in the land after him, saw that they were not Christians or tributaries and ordered them by Ganelon that they be baptized or that they send him faithfully. And they sent to deceive him thirty horses loaded with gold and silver and other riches, and another forty loaded with very a wine very pure and very sweet, that they presented to the princes and to the warriors of the host, and a thousand beautiful Sarasin women to serve them in the sin of fornication. To Ganelon the traitor, who, the message having been made, was presented with twenty horses loaded with gold and silver and with sheets of silk, so that he would deliver them to slay Rollant and Olivier and the other warriors of the host. And the traitor consented to it and received the riches. When they had thus agreed on and confirmed the treachery, Ganelon returned to Charlemagne. The riches that the two kings sent were presented, and they said that Marsile desired greatly to become Christian and that they come together to be baptised and that all Spain pay him homage. Charlemaign completely believed the traitor, who would bring him great pain. And he ordained how he would pass through the ports of Cisaire to return to France. By the counsel of Ganelon, he ordered Rollant his nephew, Duke of Mans and Count of Blaives, and Olivier his companion, Count of Gennes, and all the other warriors of the host to stay in Roncevaux with all twenty thousand frenchmen to serve as the vanguard until the host had passed the ports of Cisaire. Thus it was done as he had devised. The greatest Barons of the host who made up the vanguard, received the wine that the Sarasins had sent, while the others, the common people, took the women. And so that none of the Christians should, the night ahead of them, be drunk on Sarasin wine, and so that none shall sin with Sarasin women and with other Christian women just the same, and so that none shall be brought to France, our Lord wished that they be slain. And without fail, the intention of the Sarasins who had sent them such came to pass, that the Christians take of the presents of wine and of women, and that they should be deep in the sin of drunkenness and fornication, so that they might be corrupted and their God might let them be slain. Shall I tell ye more? When came the morning that Charlemagne and his hosts passed the ports between him and Ganelon and the bishop Turpin, and that Rollant and Oliver and the other noble warriors of the host be made to stay in Roncevaux in order to make up the rearguard, Marsile and Baligans came out of the woods in great numbers, all fifty thousand of the Sarasin armies; from the mountains and the valleys they came out to where they\\(End of the translation\\)\"\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/8iut9h/high\\_medieval\\_french\\_english/](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/8iut9h/high_medieval_french_english/)\n\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=fepOAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=&amp;#37;22en&amp;#37;20la&amp;#37;20cit&amp;#37;C3&amp;#37;A9&amp;#37;20de&amp;#37;22&amp;#37;20&amp;#37;22il&amp;#37;20retourna&amp;#37;20en&amp;#37;20france&amp;#37;22&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=RA1\\-PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false](https://books.google.com/books?id=fepOAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=%22en%20la%20cit%C3%A9%20de%22%20%22il%20retourna%20en%20france%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=RA1-PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\nHere is another translation I found of the text.\n\n[https://archive.org/stream/historyofcharles01pseuiala/historyofcharles01pseuiala\\_djvu.txt](https://archive.org/stream/historyofcharles01pseuiala/historyofcharles01pseuiala_djvu.txt)\n\n\"When this famous Emperor had thus recovered  Spain to the glory of our Lord and St. James, after  a season he returned to Pampeluna, and encamped  there, with his army. At that time there was iu  Saragossa two Saracen Kings, Marsir, and Beligard,  his brother, sent by the Soldan of Babylon from  Persia to Spain. Charles had subjugated them to  his dominion, and they served him upon all occasions, but only with feigned fidelity. For the King  having sent Ganalon to require them to be baptized, and to pay tribute, they sent him thirty horseload of gold, silver, and jewels; forty load of  wine likewise for his soldiers, and a thousand beautiful Saracen women. But at the same time they  covenanted with Ganalon to betray the King's army  into their hands for twenty horse\\-load of gold and  silver: which wicked compact being accordingly  made, Ganalon returned to the King with intelligence that Marsir would embrace the Christian faith,  and was preparing to follow him into France to receive baptism there, and would then hold all Spain under oath of fealty to him. The old soldiers would  accept the wine only, but the young men were  highly gratified with the present of the women. Charles, confiding in Gaualon, now began his march through the pass of the mountains, in his  return to France ; giving the command of the rear to  his nephew, Orlando, Count of Mans and Lord of  Guienne, and to Oliver, Count of Auvergne, ordering them to keep the station of Ronceval with thirty  thousand men, whilst he passed it with the rest of the  army. But many, who had on the night preceding  intoxicated themselves with wine, and been guilty of  fornication with the Saracen women, and other  women that followed the camp from France, incurred  the penalty of death. What more shall we say?  When Charles had safely passed the narrow strait  that leads into Gascony, between the mountains,  with twenty thousand of his warriors, Turpin, the  Archbishop, and Ganalon, and while the rear kept  guard, early in the morning Marsir and Beligard,  rushing down from the hills, where, by Ganalon's advice, they had lain two days in ambush, formed their troops into two great divisions, and with the  first of twenty thousand men attacked our army,  which making a bold resistance, fought from morning to the third hour, and utterly destroyed, the  enemy. But a fresh corps of thirty thousand Saracens now poured furiously down upon the Christians,  already faint and exhausted with righting so long,  and smote them from high to low, so that scarcely  one escaped. Some were transpierced with lances ;  some killed with clubs; others beheaded, burnt,  fiead alive, or suspended on trees ; only Orlando,  Baldwin, and Theodoric, were left: the two last gained the woods, and finally escaped. After this  terrible slaughter the Saracens retreated a league from the field of battle.\"\n\nSo right away you can assume that the figure wearing the crown isn't Charlemagne since the text explicitly says he was not at the site of the battle, and the only king\\(Or kings more accurately\\) said to be at the site of the battle are Marsile and Baligans the Saracens\\(not Basques\\) who are the ones leading the attack against the Franks.\n\nI bet anyone could glean that the Afrocentrist is full of shit just from looking up all the other pictures in the source book but I went through the trouble of getting a translation done of the work to thoroughly prove how full of shit he was.\n\nBut anyways I haven't actually looked up the page of the website that image was hosted on, I don't imagine anything on there is any better then this little \"gem\".",

This particular example is brought to you by the \"Australian Conservatives\", a political party started by someone who thought that the main conservative political party in Australia wasn't conservative *enough* for him \\(but there's no need to go into details here\\), so without further ado, I present the [Fall of Constantinople](https://www.conservatives.org.au/fall_of_constantinople) as viewed by the Australian Conservatives.\n\n&gt;**Originally the city of Byzantium, it was named Nova Roma**\n\nAs best as I can tell, the city was *never* officially called \"New Rome\". Socrates of Constantinople wrote in his *Historia Ecclesiastica* that Constantine renamed the city Contantinople and decreed that it should be \"the new, second Rome\".\n\n&gt;**The fall of Constantinople was also a watershed moment in military history. Due to their use of gunpowder to power formidable cannons, the invading Muslims penetrated the city’s ancient walls, heralding the redundancy of these long\\-used barriers to enemy attack.**\n\nAgain to the best of my knowledge, the Ottomans never managed to breach the Theodosian Walls with their siege artillery due to length of time each cannon took to reload between shots, which gave the defenders enough time to repair and brace the walls. The walls were taken partly by storm and partly because someone had forgotten to lock one of the gates \\(the Kerkoporta\\).\n\n&gt;**Monks and scholars fleeing west from the fall of Constantinople with their belongings, knowledge and transcriptions of centuries past were catalysts for the Renaissance in Western Europe.**\n\nThe Renaissance had already been underway in Italy \\- although pinning down exactly *when* it started seems to be a matter of some debate \\- for a number of years. Undoubtedly, the refugees fleeing from the fall of Constantinople helped, but they didn't* star*t the Renaissance.\n\n&gt;**After Constantinople’s fall, its magnificent “Church of the Holy Wisdom” was converted into a mosque of conquest \\(the Hagia Sophia\\)**\n\n\"Hagia Sophia\" is what the church/cathedral had been called even before the time of Justinian the Great, as there had been two previous churches on the same spot, both called \"Hagia Sophia\" and both destroyed by fire.\n\nI've probably made mistakes here, but hopefully not to the same extent as these guys.",

Probably not. There would be two narratives, each spinning madly, with no consensus. \n\nThis seems to imply that in the wake of the Watergate scandal, the general populace, unblinded by the political biases that plague modern politics, unanimously decided to ditch Nixon in a relatively short amount of time. This view completely ignores the turbulent two years between June 17, 1972, when the break\\-in occurred, and August 9, 1974, when Nixon actually resigned.\n\nDuring this time, Nixon supporters and opponents viciously attacked each other and debated the facts of the case. You can see this in contemporary news articles. In his 1973 \"[Response List For Nixon Backers](http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/syndicated-columnists/article187662578.html)\" \\(republished online by the *The Kansas City Star*\\), Art Buchwald satirizes Nixon's supporters, portraying them as denying the facts of the case and doubting the investigation's importance. It wasn't until mid\\-\\`1974 that Republicans started turning on Nixon. As late as July 21, 1974, mere weeks before his resignation, the New York Times published \"[Mr. Nixon's Supporters Don't Take It Quietly](https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/21/archives/mr-nixons-supporters-dont-take-it-quietly-aides-and-outsiders-damn.html)\" detailing the countermeasures employed by the president and his grassroots supporters, who held that the issue did not merit impeachment and that the controversy was manufactured by the liberal media, \"McGovern crowd,\" and Republican Eastern Establishment. Even in the days culminating to his resignation, [Gallup reported that Nixon had the approval of a full quarter of Americans](http://news.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx).\n\nBasically, for most of the Watergate scandal, there was anything but \"a bipartisan, national consensus that the president had done grave misdeeds and needed to resign,\" showing that partisanship is hardly a modern phenomenon.",

        "text": "In the thirtieth Millennium, there is only bad history. Master of Mankind by the Might of his armies, and unifier of Holy Terra, the immortal Emperor comes to the last Church on earth, to try and make the last priest give up his faith. What follows, is, in parts, terrible history.\n\nThe following extracts are from the Black Library book 'The last Church'.  \n\nUriah is the last priest at the titular last church on Earth.\n\nRevelation is the God Emperor of Mankind, in disguise, attempting to convince the priest to give up his faith by pointing out the horrors of religion.\n\n&gt;The history of religion is a horror story, Uriah, and if you doubt it, just look at what humanity has\ndone in the name of their gods over the millennia. Thousands of years ago, a bloody theocracy that\nvenerated a feathered-serpent god rose in the Mayan jungles. To appease this vile god, its priests\ndrowned maidens in sacred wells and cut out the hearts of children. They believed this serpent god\nhad an earthly counterpart and the temple builders drove the first pile through a maiden’s body to\npacify this non-existent creature.’\n\n\nI don't know much about central american religions, but wasn't it the inca's that killed kids via leaving them on mountains to die, and the Aztecs that offered up enemy warriors? I'll admit, I might be getting this wrong.\n\n\n&gt;Uriah turned to Revelation in horror and said, ‘You can’t seriously compare my religion to such\nheathen barbarism?’\n&gt;‘Can’t I?’ countered Revelation. ‘In the name of your religion, a holy man launched a war with the\nbattle cry of “Deus Vult”, which means “god wills it” in one of the ancient tongues of Old Earth. His\nwarriors were charged with destroying enemies in a far-off kingdom, but first they fell upon those in\ntheir own lands who opposed the war. Thousands were dragged from their homes and hacked to death\nor burned alive. \n\n1)The Rhineland massacres were less 'killing those who opposed the war', more 'we need supplies and you are rich' + religious conflict against Jews.\n\n2)The church condemned these attacks and bishops in areas did try to help them.\n\n\n&gt;Then, satisfied their homeland was secure, the zealous legions plundered their way thousands of miles to the holy city they were to liberate. Upon reaching it, they killed every inhabitant to “purify” the symbolic city of taint. I remember one of their leaders saying that he rode in blood up to the knees and even to his horse’s bridle, by the just and marvellous judgement of god.’\n\n1)The 'blood up to the knees' was hyperbole.\n\n2)The entire thing wasn't a 'PURGE THEM!!!' To claim as much is reductionist.\n\nFirst, we need to remember that the sacking of cities and massacres wasn't exactly unusual in the period. Yet interestingly, the killings aren't a continuation of the post assault climax. It occurs several days afterwards. Indeed, Albert of Aachen stresses that: \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"After they heard this advice, on the third day after the victory judgement was pronounced by the leaders and everyone seized weapons and surged forth for a wretched massacre of all the crowd of gentiles which was still left, bringing out some from fetters and beheading them, slaughtering others who were found throughout the city streets and districts, whom they had previously spared for the sake of money or human pity.\"\n\n\nWhat is neat about this? Well, it tells us a few things!\n\n*The killings weren't just a hotblooded spill over from the siege. You're not going to contain a constant murderboner for 3 days.\n\n*The killings were a judgement and decision actively decided upon by the Crusader leadership.\n\n*Jews and Muslims had been previously spared by the crusaders, for ransom and other reasons.\n\nOf course, why might wonder why they decided to kill them all. The answer is that a large army was approaching from Egypt and if the crusaders had stayed in Jerusalem? They would have been fucked. The city was damaged by the siege, and their supplies were low; not to mention the fact that the local population would have provided Islamic forces with a perfect fifth column. Nor could they realistically leave a large garrison behind to maintain the city, when they marched forth. \n\nEnd result? The city gets secured via the purging of potential rebels, then the crusaders march off to the Battle of Ascalon.\n\n&gt;‘That is ancient history,’ said Uriah. ‘You cannot vouchsafe the truth of events so lost in the mists of\ntime.’\n\n&gt;‘If it were one event, I might agree with you,’ replied Revelation, ‘but just a hundred or so years\nlater, another holy man declared war on a sect of his own church. His warriors laid siege to the sect’s\nstronghold in ancient Franc, and when the city fell his generals asked their leader how they might tell\nthe faithful from the traitor among the captives. This man, who followed your god, ordered the\nwarriors to “Kill them all. God will know His own”. Nearly twenty thousand men, women and\nchildren were slaughtered. \n\n\nI'll admit, I don't know enough about this area to make any hard statements, but it's more than just the papacy involved, isn't it? There's the influence of the northern French lords and the attempt to crush the independence/culture of the region? Perhaps someone more qualified than me can add to this.\n\n&gt;Worst of all, the hunt for any that had escaped the siege led to the establishment of an organisation known as the Inquisition, a dreadful, monstrous plague of hysteria that gave its agents free rein to stretch, burn, pierce and break their victims on fiendish pain machines to force them to confess to disbelief and identify fellow transgressors. Later, with most of their enemies hunted down and killed, the Inquisition shifted its focus to wychcraft, and priests tortured untold thousands of women into confessing that they engaged in unnatural acts with daemons. They were then burned or hanged for their confessions and this hysteria raged for three centuries in a dozen nations, a madness that saw whole towns exterminated and over a hundred thousand dead.’\n\n1)The inquisition did not lead the witch trails. It was largely secular courts that did that. While church courts did indeed sometimes get involved in witchcraft accusations, it was largely the secular courts that dished out the harshest punishments.\n\n\n2)It was not soley focused or targeted at women. Men suffered accusations and burnings too. Iceland, for example, suffered more men punished for witchcraft than women. While several explanations for the witch hunts exist (from 'grain was lsd/purging of weak members of society in a time of crisis' etc etc'). While it is true that social positions of women, and their status didn't help them, it was by no means a 'KILLING WOMEN AND ONLY WOMEN WORSE THAN THE HOLOCAUST!' tier thing that some claim it to be.\n\n\n\nNow! I'm sure you are all thinking 'but what if the Emperor knew this, but he was twisting the historical truth around to fuel his own narrative about religion being bad?'\n\nI'd say you are probably right (if we ignore the meta reasoning of the writer not knowing history). But that doesn't excuse his badhistory.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n*Norman Roth, \"Bishops and Jews in the Middle Ages,\" The Catholic Historical Review 80, no. 1 (1994)\n http://www.jstor.org/stable/25024201.\n\n*Christopher Tyerman, God's War: A New History of the Crusades (Harvard University Press, 2006)\n\n*WolfgangBehringer, Witches and Witch-Hunts: a global history (2004)\n\n*Albert of Aachen, Historia Ierosolimitana : history of the journey to Jerusalem , ed. and trans. by Susan B.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8lybor/jordan_peterson_butchers_french_intellectual/",
        "text": "What happened to French intellectualism in the 1960s? Where did \"identity politics\" come from? What's the connection to Marxism? And how do they differ in France and North America? If you're interested in remaining confused yet angry about all of these questions, and vilifying a shape\\-shifting cast of \\(neo\\)marxists, postmodernists, radicals, and sundry scapegoats, allow me to introduce you to the narratives of Jordan B. Peterson, armchair intellectual historian of the transatlantic journey of French ideas to North American academia:\n\n&gt;What happened in the late 1960s, as far as I can tell—this happened mostly in France, which has probably produced the most reprehensible coterie of public intellectuals that any country has ever managed—is that in the late 1960s when all the student activists had decided that the Marxist revolution wasn’t going to occur in the western world and finally had also realized that apologizing for the Soviet system was just not going to fly anymore given the tens of millions of bodies that had stacked up, they performed what I would call a philosophical sleight of hand and transformed the class war into an identity politics war. And that became extraordinarily popular mostly transmitted through people like Jacques Derrida, who became an absolute darling of the Yale English department and had his pernicious doctrines spread throughout north America partly as a consequence of his invasion of Yale. And what happened with the postmodernists is that they kept on peddling their murderous breed of political doctrine under a new guise. \\[Harvard talk\\]\n\n**TLDR: Marxism did not magically morph into identity politics or postmodernism \\(after May 1968 or ever, really\\). Derrida was indeed popular at Yale\\-\\-as a literary theorist, not a murder\\-peddler.**\n\nVery broadly, we could say that this is Peterson's version of the origins of what's called \"French Theory\": the standard scholarly term for the North American reception of postwar French ideas \\(Peterson never uses term, to my knowledge\\). Amusingly, French people also use the English term “French Theory.” This reflects the profound Americanization, domestication, and distortion of the concepts as they were applied to our social/political projects in academia. François Cusset's history *French Theory* capably charts this transatlantic journey. In 1960s France, the main intellectual current was structuralism, which peaked in *the annus mirab*ilis of 1966, a year marked by a profusion of famous books such as Foucaul*t's Les mots et les choses: Une archéologie des sciences hum*aines. These masterpieces had nothing do with \"identity politics\" and almost everything to do with the linguistic paradigms of structuralism applied to the human sciences.\n\nI will now address the historical questions raised by the \"world's most important thinker\":\n\n* Did France produce the \"most reprehensible coterie of public intellectuals\" of any country? This is a value judgement, but the short answer is no. The collaborationist intellectuals across Europe, or actual Nazi ideologues, are more guilty than the French left Peterson vilifies. Ultimately, the 1973 French publication of *The Gulag Archipelago* shamed the French far left and the so\\-called nouveaux philosophes sprung up opportunistically as the Stalin/Mao sympathizers vanished. The student protests of 1968 are monumentally important, but they did not cause Derrida \\(or Foucault\\) to fundamentally change his philosophical course. All of Derrida's [work  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida_bibliography)in the 60s is within the tradition of philosophy; he would not explicitly address politics for a long time indeed. Peterson should give French intellectuals a second chance: he red\\-baits them so relentlessly that he doesn't realize that quite a few of them would be incredibly useful to his project, particularly George Dumézil, Claude Lévi\\-Strauss, Raymond Aron, François Furet, and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle \\(kidding about the last one\\).\n* Did French intellectuals transform the class war into an identity politics war? Absolutely fucking not. North American academics applied French ideas to their own ends, but in France, identity politics was not \"a thing\" in the 1960s. Indeed it came to France, much later, by virtue of North America.  Cusset argues, in a sense, that identity politics and PC are quite un\\-French \\(cf. p 170\\-73\\). Our PC debates are not new, nor are the contradictory villains \\(\"postmodern neomarxists\"\\). As Cusset details:\n\n&gt;Playing up the amusing effect of enumeration, the newspapers depicted the partisans of PC as one big melee of extremist jargon\\-slingers,  comprising multiculturalists, gay activists, new historicists, Marxist critics, esoteric Derridean theorists, neofeminists, and young proto\\-Black Panthers. The journalists' tone was often even more caustic than at the height of the cold war. An editorial in the Chicago Tribune on January 7, 1991, accused professors of nothing short of \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\n* More historical work on the genesis of American identity politics needs to be done, but it is obvious that much of it comes from domestic sources. Gay rights did not need Foucault. American Feminism did not need so\\-called French Feminism. And American thought on race was not much helped by French thinkers, who were often reticent to address the topic \\(I'm not counting Fanon\\). Certainly, proponents of identity politics read French theory\\-\\-but they used it as a tool from within the preexisting contexts and aims of their own disciplines.\n* Did Derrida disseminate identity politics? Hell no. He was a philosopher primarily concerned with philosophy. It is impossible to locate nefarious identity politics in works like *Of Grammatology*. While it might be found in North American applications of Derrida, it sure ain’t in Derrida.\n* Was Derrida hot shit at Yale? Sort of. The \"Yale School of Deconstruction\" \\(J. Hillis Miller et al.\\) was a major vector of Derrida's thought, and he was much loved by his students there according to his biographer Peeters. But ultimately his time at UC Irvine was more important. What was far more important than Derrida being physically present in North America, however, was the fact that his works were translated early and often. He was known to North Americans after the famous Johns Hopkins conference of 1966, but deconstruction did not enter into broader intellectual circles for quite some time. The seminal translation was Spivak’s \\(not very good\\) rendition of *Of Grammatology*, complete with a massive introduction that was influential by itself.\n* Was Derrida \\(or Foucault\\) a Marxist? No. Derrida never joined the PCF, and distanced himself from Marxism at various times despite its popularity at the ENS. He did write one \\(poorly received\\) book on Marx. Foucault famously said “Marxism exists in the nineteenth century like a fish in water: that is, it is unable to breath anywhere else”: radical as he was, he constantly feuded with the dogmatic French left. As always, the epithet “postmodern neomarxist” falls apart upon close examination.\n* Was Derrida a peddler of a \"murderous political doctrine\"? No. He railed against totalitarianism, and, more generally, totalizing or totalitarian systems of thought. A case could be made that he's a bad philosopher. But he does not deserve to be referred to in the same breath as \"murderous political doctrine\". According to his biographer, and people I know who studied with him, he was a generous teacher and kind person. In the end, perhaps his most important contributions to the history of thought were his profound meditations of what it is like to be seen naked by your cat.\n\nSources:\n\n*History of Structuralism* by François Dosse \\(2 volumes\\) \\[available via Google\\]\n\n*French Theory* by François Cusset \\[available via Google\\]\n\n*Michel Foucault* by Didier Eribon \\[a biography\\]\n\n*Derrida: A Biography* by Benoît Peeters\n\n*Comprendre le XXe siècle français* by Jean\\-François Sirinelli",

Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998987396870950912)\". Which raises the question: *did* the thirteen colonies rebel in order to abolish all class distinction and create an equal society in which wealth was shared equally by all? Worth examining!\n\nThe most obvious place to start is with the [Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/), the formal list of grievances issued against the King and Parliament in 1776. Here you will find a number of specific complaints, from \"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people\" to \"He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people\" to \"He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions\", and yet nowhere is it charged that \"He has created a tiered system of social rank for the purpose of preventing the Free Mobility of the People and oppressing the masses\". This should perhaps not being a surprise, given the social makeup of the signers, so we might need to look for other evidence of the social leveling tendencies of John Adams.\n\nOne place to look might be in their actions--after all such a radical egalitarian vision may have been too much to put down on paper, but it surely guided their concrete actions. One place to look might be the immediate post-Revolutionary period, when an economic crisis hit the colonies and set off a chain of political discontents. One of these was in Rhode Island, where farmers in the hinterland who were crushed by debts swept a new legislature into office who enacted reforms forcing merchants to accept paper money in debt repayment. This burst of political energy by the lower orders must have pleased the social revolutionary founders? Not quite: To give just one example, James Madison [gave a speech](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s2.html) against paper money and much of the Federalist energy in favor of a Constitutional Convention was around fears of similar populist uprisings in other states. And of course there is Shays Rebellion, in which smallholders, many of them the veterans who actually fought in the war, shut down courts in order to halt foreclosures. This prompted Sam Adams to draw up a Riot Act suspending the right of habeas corpus, which might be deemed a somewhat \"oppressive measure\", or at least not a sign of enthusiasm for breaking down class barriers.\n\nThere are of course many different reasons for the American Revolution--one might point to the Proclamation Line of 1763 preventing westward expansion of settlement, which both fomented discontent among settlers themselves and nullified the considerable investment many future leaders such as George Washington had made in land claims west of the line. One might point to the Sommerset Case of 1772, in which a judge ruled that slavery was not supported by common law of England, spooking southern planters. One might point to British mercantile policy which disfavored major shipping magnates like John Hancock, or the pervasive corruption and nepotism that harmed the advancement of men such as John Adams. Or general discontent regarding the perception of central encroachment upon local rule and pervasive social injustices afflicting Colonial America. And a matter of tea or something.\n\nProbably not any sort of high minded social leveling sentiment, though.\n\nA good source for this is Alan Taylor's *American Revolutions*.",

        "text": "So Reason, a libertarian media organization, published the following article: [An Economist Goes to Shanghai](http://reason.com/archives/2017/05/11/an-economist-goes-to-shanghai)\n\nAnd it's a decent article. People of different perspectives can quibble about the facts of the matter but it presents their case well. \n\nI don't wish to spout such arguments however, so my disagreement is going to be fairly pandatic. Because I am bored. The article has the following line: \n\n\"India's story has been the same since 1991, after 44 wretched years of Gandhian socialism that led to poor-people-damaging rates of growth at which it would take seven decades to merely double.\"\n\nI don't quite know what poor-people-damaging rates of growth is supposed to mean, but yes, the overall statement is that the 1991 reforms of India lead to significant increases in the rates of growth. This is largely correct. The GPD per capita of India before 1991 was 6270 Rupees, from 1991 to 2016, it increased to 93,293 rupees. OECD said the following: \n\n\"Annual growth in GDP per capita has accelerated from just 1¼ per cent in the three decades after Independence to 7½ per cent currently, a rate of growth that will double average income in a decade.... In service sectors where government regulation has been eased significantly or is less burdensome—such as communications, insurance, asset management and information technology—output has grown rapidly, with exports of information technology enabled services particularly strong. In those infrastructure sectors which have been opened to competition, such as telecoms and civil aviation, the private sector has proven to be extremely effective and growth has been phenomenal.\"\n\nI will also cite [this](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp0443.pdf) IMF article and highlight important things, namely, the following statement: \"DeLong’s contention that we lack hard evidence to support the view that the rapid growth of the second half of the 1980s could not be sustained without the second wave of reforms in the 1990s is untenable. I have argued that pre-1991 growth was itself fragile and sporadic. And even then, it ended in a balance of payments crisis.\"\n\nEssentially what it addresses is, India grew significantly in the 1980s, and what is to say the 1991 reforms mattered? The argument, and the evidence suppports this argument, is that without the 1991 reforms it would have tapered off. \n\nQuickly, these reforms included the removal of many regulations surrounding businesses, monetary reform, radical reduction in deficits, removal of the \"license raj\", radical cutting of tariffs, and so on. In short, it moved India closer to a capitalist economy, and in doing so it improved India's finanical situation. \n\nSo what is wrong with the statement presented by Reason? It is correct in saying that India's economy was hampered by an ideology and the removal of said ideology was instrumental in its success. But the ideology in question was NOT Gandhian socialism, it was Nehruvian socialism. \n\nSome of you may be thinking, oh god OP is going to make yet another tired no true communism or no true socialism argument, I'm not. Had the author said \"socialist\" she would have been fine. But she didn't. Gandhian socialism and Nehruvian socialism are 2 very very very distinct things. \n\nAs some of you know, Ghandhi was assassinated in 1948. Nehru, a less well known freedom fighter (who probably had as much, if not more, influence on the Indian Independence Movement) took control of the \"Congress\" party, which was the political group central to India's independence from Britain. The Indian National Congress (INC) would rule India virtually uncontested for 25 years (when pretty much everything falls apart. A collation of fascists, Maoists (based in Mao's variant of communism, yes the Chinese), capitalists, and socialists teamed up to remove Congress from power, that's how bad it gets.)\n\nNehruvian socialism therefore won the day. But even if Ghandhi didn't get shot, it is important to point out that Ghandhi, though loved and well respected by many, simply couldn't be a political leader in the traditional sense. Ghandhi was altruistic, perhaps to a fault, with millions who followed him. His power came from those people acting in solidarity, united under his ideas and his goodness. But he couldn't be a central figure, alone, who leads. He couldn't play politics, not in the way Nehru could. He lead India to independence, but he couldn't lead the country, and this inability was displayed most prominently with the partition plan. His push for unity between Hindus and Muslims rang hollow in a country that had moved well beyond that point, with borders already drawn and fighting in the streets. Idealistic, but not the mark of a **political** leader. And the best way, perhaps, to understand Ghandhi was as a spiritual-like leader, and not a political one. \n\nAcclaimed Indian author Gurcharan Das describes the differences between Ghandhian Socialism and Nehruvian socialism as follows: \n\n\"There were two competing visions. Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of self-reliant villages, with a reinvigorated agriculture and craft production. He opposed modern urban industry because it dehumanized man. Jawaharlal Nehru had a modern scientific mind, and he was much impressed by the economic gains of the Soviet revolution; but he was also committed to democracy. He had a vision of democratic socialism with the state leading the process of industrialization. He spurned capitalism because it exploited and it created inequalities ... Gandhi distrusted technology but not businessmen. Nehru distrusted businessmen but not technology\"\n\nThat is a decent summary. Ghandhi did not like industrialization. He believed strongly that the tools used should be labor heavy, and that there should be dignity in work. He wasn't quite the capitalist Das makes him out to be, but he was more of a capitalist than Nehru. Nehru's policies were more aligned with European Socialism (pre-fall of USSR). \n\n[This essay](http://www.yabaluri.org/CD%20&amp;%20WEB/gandhiansocialismoct66.htm) provides a decent summary of what Ghandhi believed. He had this idea of \"communism without violence.\" Socialism is predicated on class conflict, to Ghandhi, there is a move towards a more equal society without this conflict. he believed in *swadharma* or \"individual responsibility. In this way, ironically, Ghandhi's beliefs were **extremely libertarian.** He did not like state power or control. He did not believe everyone should be exactly the same. \n\nRather, he would have everyone accept differences. The better in society would, as capitalists do, earn more from society. However, \"excess wealth\" would be distributed to the masses. The superior would still be richer by this process, but only as \"trustees\" to the wealth of society. At the end of the day, labor is a virtue and mechanization should be discouraged. \n\nIllustrating this is his belief that he was fighting the British, though not all of the British system. There is value, in his mind, to replacing the British elites with Indian elites under the same system. He opposed the system, of course, but he was different than Nehru in this respect. \n\nNehru believed in state control. Unlike Ghandhi, who sought to eliminate the caste system through grassroots efforts and talking to communities, Nehru imposed a top-down reservation system for the lowest castes. Nehru brought businesses under strict licences and governmental control. Ghandhi, under swadharma, would never have done such a thing and probably would have left them to their own devices. To change the capitalist system Ghandhi would operate through the masses in a nonviolent fashion. \n\nI suppose a Westerner might simplify this as, Ghandhi was a Marxist, Nehru a Leninist socialist. But even that is way too much of a simplification. Ghandhi objected to many elements of Marxist philosophy, such as class struggle. Ghandhi and to an extent Nehru strongly objected to the system of forced labor that categorized the Soviet Union. \n\nA better categorization is this, Gandhian Socialism is an infusion of Marxist beliefs, Indian beliefs found in Gita and the Upanishads, and Thoreau (he based a lot of his non-violence beliefs on Thoreau's \"Civil Disobedience\"). It is important not to undermine how central Indian beliefs in dharma (duty), swadharma (responsibility), ahimsa (enlightenment), Panchayat raj (village-rule system) and so on were, though it is really difficult to explain them to a Western audience. \n\nWhereas Nehru was a traditional European socialist who, in direct opposition to Ghandhi, loved industrialization and thought it central to making India a major power. Additionally, he sought major state control of the economy in order to orient India towards more industrialization. \n\nSo in summary, Reason Magazine is correct in saying that by adopting Nehruvian socialism, India suffered greatly. But instead of calling it Nehruvian socialism, they called it Ghandhian socialism. I think if Reason looked into Ghandhian socalism, they would of course find much to dislike (and I am not claiming it is a good philosophy, in fact I believe both are terrible) but I think they would find much to like as well. \n\nSmall point, easy mistake to make for a Western magazine, and this is mostly pandatic and an excuse for me to discuss Indian history and philosophy. But I don't go to temple for nothing and I might as well, right?\n\nEdit: Edited to correct misspelling of \"Ghandhi\"",

        "text": "https://i.imgur.com/z8fPSNa.png\n\nI'm not going to talk too much about whether \"barbarians\" (which would comprise dozens of ethnic groups throughout Europe, Africa and Asia) were taller or stronger or fitter than Roman soldiers, I don't think that's something you could accurately measure. I find fitter and stronger doubtful considering the difference in training, taller probably depends on the barbarian group in question. For what it's worth, the Romans offered some commentary on this in the 5th century AD, mocking the gangly builds and \"narrow arms\" of their Gothic compatriots, but that isn't exactly an unbiased source. Either way, I think the idea that \"Romans stood no chance\" in single combat with barbarians is ridiculous, as is the idea that the Roman method of warfare is a kind of abandonment of a warrior ethos. \n\nThe Romans practiced and enjoyed single combat throughout their entire history, and by most accounts seem to have excelled at it. Polybius tells us:\n\n&gt;To the man who has wounded an enemy, a spear; to him who has slain and stripped an enemy, a cup if he be in the infantry and horse trappings if in the cavalry, although the gift here was originally only a spear. These gifts are not made to men who have wounded or stripped an enemy in a regular battle or at the storming of a city, but to those who during skirmishes or in similar circumstances, where there is no necessity for engaging in single combat, have voluntarily and deliberately thrown themselves into the danger.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;Besides, he who makes the oration over the man about to be buried, when he has finished speaking of him recounts the successes and exploits of the rest whose images are present, beginning with the most ancient  By this means, by this constant renewal of the good report of brave men, the celebrity of those who performed noble deeds is rendered immortal, while at the same time the fame of those who did good service to their country becomes known to the people and a heritage for future generations. But the most important result is that young men are thus inspired to endure every suffering for public welfare in the hope of winning the glory that attends on brave men. What I say is confirmed by the facts. For many Romans have voluntarily engaged in single combat in order to decide a battle, not a few have faced certain death, some in war to save the lives of the rest, and others in peace to save the republic. \n\nSo, they fought, but did they win? Or did they 'stand no chance' as Varg argues? Well, according to the Romans, they won near universally. From  T. Manlius (yes, really) Torquatas' victory over an anonymous Gaul in 367 BC , to Sounikas' triumph over a Persian Exarch in the 6th century AD, the Romans seem to have fared quite well. In his article 'Single Combat in the Roman Republic', S. P. Oakley offers thirty examples of Romans engaging in single combat with foreigners, and the Romans are victorious in all of them. You could argue that the Romans wouldn't be too keen on reporting on engagements that their soldiers had lost, but at the same time, would it be so surprising that combatants who regularly drilled and trained and had equipment of superior design and operated as part of a professional fighting force would win over what were in most instances part-time warriors?\n\nThe quotes from Polybius above are specifically referring to the Late Republic, but the Roman tradition of single combat continued well beyond that period. I've seen some people say that although maybe the Romans had a tradition of single combat in their earlier years, their martial prowess was somehow weakened or softened by their adoption of Christianity, but this definitely isn't the case. In the Later Empire, an Emperor's worthiness was often seen as correlating to their abilities in battle. A good emperor was expected to be a filopólemos (a lover of war) and possess the essential virtue of 'fortitudo' - which had a multitude of different connotations over the course of Roman history but in the Late Empire specifically referred  to fighting prowess. Constantine was held up as being a particularly good example of what the Romans referred to as a 'bellator' (warrior). A Panegyric says of him:\n\n&gt; Fortune has placed you above all checks to the acquisition of glory, you wished to advance by serving as a soldier, and by confronting the dangers of war and by engaging the enemy even in single combat you have made yourself more notable among the nations, since you cannot become more noble.\n\nEusebius also writes:\n&gt; He [Constantine] seized by the hair and carried off a fierce barbarian and threw him down at the feet of the emperor. Sent by Galerius through a swamp, he entered it alone on his horse and made a way for the rest of the army to the Sarmatians, of whom he slew many and won the victory for Galerius.\n\nLater on, during the 359 Siege of Amida, we are told of a contingent of restless legionaries taking matters into their own hands and storming the Persian camp in an attempt to kill Shapur II. Ammianus Marcellinus, who was present during the siege, writes that although the Romans defeated many Persians in single combat and nearly accomplished their goal, they were forced to retreat under a barrage of arrows. \n\nYou can go even later than this. The 6th century Strategikon decrees that soldiers \"should be trained in single combat against others, armed with shield and spear, and also in throwing the short javelin and the lead dart at long distance\".\n\nThroughout Roman military history we see countless examples of soldiers who engaged in feats of martial excellence, and these soldiers were often rewarded and held up as shining examples of what a Roman should be. And this isn't something limited to one era or the other, we find it as a constant, all the way from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD, and I imagine even beyond that if we were to examine later Byzantine sources, but I don't have much expertise on that front. So, in short I think Varg is wrong.\n\nSources:\n\n* Cowan, Ross. *Roman Legionary: AD 284–337.

The purpose of the celebration was to emphasize the importance of Jerusalem as the center of Judaism, not a literal overcoming of a \"slave mentality.\" It's also based on a myth.\n\n\"Jump to the present\"- The most sustained period of anti-Semitism, at least in Europe, is completely skipped over by the article. I can only wonder why this period of a thousand years, culminating in the Holocaust, is completely ignored.",

But let's hear him out. Maybe there's something interesting we can learn from this...\n\n&gt;They provoke people. Since they can never be satisfied they drive men to need to acquire more resources to please them. They change sides and cause jealousy because they have no loyalty to anyone. \n\n&gt;This all causes conflict between men as they work to gain more ground while in pursuit of foids. \n\nAnd no. \n\n1. Hitchen's Razor should take care of this one. \n\n2. This model that seeks to explain conflict through the relationships between men and women ignores far more pressing factors while failing to explain its key premise. Take the First Crusade: why are we focusing on a celibate figure's \"pursuit\" of women (Pope Urban II) while ignoring the greater ongoing conflict between Islam and Christianity and the contemporary political situation in Europe? Was the pressing threat posed by Islamic expansions to Christians less important then the Pope wanting to get laid (which he could have done without a Crusade)?\n\n&gt;Foids want men to fight over them so that they can feel valued. They put men against each other to compete for their approval. The one who dies does not get the approval. \n\nThe most famous example of this was World War 2 where English \"foids\" sent English men to fight German men so \"foid\"-Elizabeth could decide whether she wanted chad-Tommy or chad-Jerry... /s\n\nWomen don't send men off to war as part of sexual selection. In most cases decisions to go to war are made by men, and in many modern conflicts women have found themselves serving in a variety of roles, including some combat ones. \n\nFurthermore, women are often some of the biggest victims of war: losing husbands and sons, [facing sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre) and their own lives to bombings and famine. Why on earth would they put themselves through that?\n\nFinally, if women want to find worthy men isn't a war an awful way to go about it? [If you're a woman who wants to get laid a conflict like the War of the Triple Alliance where 70% of your countries men die is an awful way to go about it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_War)\n\n&gt;Foids hate men like incels who can see right through their games. They will team up together and will stop at nothing to destroy him, just like IT does.\n\nHang on, what? If I understood this poorly phrased sentence correctly it suggests women and the men they send to their deaths to prove their worthiness are teaming up to kill the men women have already rejected.\n\nI'll let that stand for itself.\n\n&gt;Foids are blood thirsty and use their social powers to manipulate people into fights, battles and wars to satisfy their blood lust. They have a hate for anything that doesn't bleed because they bleed from their vaginas every month and they can't stop it from happening. \n\nAs I have demonstrated, this is ridicolous. Unless Pope Urban II had a woman whispering in his ear to start a crusade so they could identify chads, the Austro-Hungarian officials who declared war on Serbia in 1914 had a woman in their ears because they wanted to see Serbian men die, and every other conflict ever had women whispering into the ears of men the assertion that wars start because of women and their social maneuverings should go back into the trash-can of misogynistic rubbish.\n\n\n**THE BONUS ROUND YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR**\n\n\n[&gt;Just ask yourself if WW2 would have happened if Hitlers crush didn‘t brutally deny him and if she hadn‘t spent her freetime with different Chad-officers every other day. I know this is no reason to start a war at all, but behavior like this drives men into mental problems. This war just another reason he got more and more depressed and filled with wrath against other people.](https://imgur.com/Afa5ViN)\n\nThis appears to reference [this woman,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_and_Stefanie_Rabatsch) who Hitler knew as a young man, got a friend to stalk and Hitler never personally talked to. Beyond not being a brutal rejection (Stefanie barely knew Hitler existed and Hitler never let his feelings be known in person) multiple academics have disputed the impact of Stefanie on Hitler's life.\n\nHitler's political beliefs, including Nazism, did not develop as a result of being romantically rejected, nor did Stefanie have any impact on Hitler's rise to power. Blaming an early rejection for why he hated \"people\" enough to commit genocide is absurd: most people rejected by crushes as teenagers do not become genocidal mass murderers.\n\nThe only circumstance where this would have changed is if Hitler became happily married and Nazism did not rise in Germany without him. But then again, in our typical human way we would have found another conflict to fight, either against other Fascist nations or Communism. So to answer the OP's question I'd put my money on WW2.\n",

Let's stick to the facts!\"](https://i.imgur.com/kQ5SGti.png)\n\nFirst of all, why the 18th century? The ancient romans made one kind of meatballs, the Poume d'oranges of the middle ages could've come from an arabic influence - But this is still much too early! Does the author not believe that meatballs existed before the 18th century?\n\n&gt;\"Another popular dish of Middle Eastern origin found in English collections (and elsewhere) is the recipe for gilded meatballs called *Poume d'oranges* in Anglo-Norman MS A and *Pome dorreng* in the menu for Henry IV's coronation feast.\"\n[Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe: A Book of Essays, page 27](https://books.google.se/books?id=VelSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true)\n\n~~Turkey. Jeez. This might be nitpicking, but [Turkey did not exist in the 18th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), it wasn't until after the first world war that the ottoman sultanate fell.~~ I'll cede that the tweet could regard the region of Turkey, even if I really want to make a point about the king spending very little time in Turkey itself.\n\nI take rather large offense to the final statement. \"Let's stick to the facts!\".\nThese aren't facts, there are no sources to this, [the manager of the twitter account officially said that they had no sources for the fact, and that they assumed they were talking about common knowledge.](https://nyheteridag.se/statligt-twitter-konto-spred-fake-news-om-att-svenska-kottbullar-kom-fran-turkiet/) Clearly not.\n\n\nWhat I think happened, is a simple mixup. We often hear unverified stories about how Charles XII, king of Sweden, brought home the cabbage roll (Kåldolmar) from the Ottoman Empire, during the great northern war. It's become a sort of an urban myth, that no-one can claim with full security, nor fully disprove. \n\n\nPlease let me know if I've done anything wrong, it's my first time doing a badhistory post!\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8hnaz4/a_video_overview_of_the_taiping_rebellion/",
        "text": "~~Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGAPsmIQ6JE)~~ EDIT: The video was actually ripped from the original creator's, which is now unlisted.\n\nI will say that a lot of what is said here isn't all that wrong, particularly early on. But then it gets worse.\n\nUp till around the 30-second mark, the video is actually generally all right. Although its account of Hong's visions is relatively simple, the experience was frequently revised to add new elements to retroactively justify earlier Taiping activity, so there's no real 'correct' version. It starts going a bit wrong from here on out:\n\nAt 0:32 the animation says that Hong received a Protestant tract (*Good Words for Admonishing the Age*) written by Edwin Stevens. However, whilst Hong is likely to have received the tract from Stevens, the tract itself was written by a Chinese convert named Leung Fat/Liang Fa. This is more an innocuous error than a severe one. At around 1:05 the narrator mentions Feng Yunshan was a friend of Hong's, but he was also his cousin. Again, a relatively innocuous error.\n\n1:23, however, baffles me. The animation says Hong travelled to Hong Kong in 1847 to study Christianity with Edwin Stevens. Why is this bewildering? At the time, Stevens was dead. Indeed, he had been dead for ten years – it was Issachar Roberts whom Hong studied under.\n\nWhat the narrator says at 1:30 also involves a severe omission, as 'current Chinese culture' involved, in large part, that which Hong believed to have been imposed by the Manchus, yet the word 'Manchu' never comes up in the narration.\n\nThe narrator goes on to butcher Nanjing as 'nah-jeng' at 1:51 and Tianjing as 'tee-oh-zhin' at 1:52. His pronunciation of Yang Xiuqing as 'young shee-oh-chen' at 2:00 is completely out to lunch. Further, his claim at 2:10 that Yang only gained prominence after the death of Feng by channeling the voice of God is, to put it mildly, inaccurate. Yang had begun channeling the voice of God in 1848, and his title as East King was 'Lord of Nine Thousand Years', ahead of Feng Yunshan, the South King and 'Lord of Seven Thousand Years'. (Xiao Chaogui, the voice of Jesus who also died on the way to Nanjing, was West King and 'Lord of Eight Thousand Years'.) Strangely, it is also asserted that Yang Xiuqing was 'an official who helped run the government and helped the army strategise', but Yang was the supreme military and government leader, not some mere 'official'. Indeed, Yang appears to have been largely illiterate and dictated to scribes rather than writing himself.\n\nThe account of the 1856 coups breaks down a bit. Hong was not simply 'annoyed by Yang', as is claimed at 2:19, but actively threatened by Yang, who was attempting to gain the title of 'Lord of Ten Thousand Years' and thereby be on equal constitutional footing. Hong also did not simply 'think Wei to be arrogant', as is claimed at 2:26 – Shi Dakai demanded Wei's death after he executed Shi's family. 2:20 also sees a mispronunciation of Wei Changhui, but it's a comparatively tame one. \n\nThen at 2:40 it suddenly skips to 1862. What!? What about Hong Rengan's attempted reform programme? What about the Siege of Anqing? The failed campaign in Anhui? Li Xiucheng's attempted attack on Shanghai? Anglo-French intervention? The Ever-Victorious Army? Li Hongzhang? *Zeng Guofan*? What happened!? How do you miss that!?\n\nAt 2:55, it is claimed that Hong died after drinking poison, but this is debatable – he had already been declaring weeds to be 'manna from heaven' and it is not improbable that it was food poisoning from the weeds rather than a deliberate act of suicide that did in Hong. \n\nAgain, we have a butchered pronunciation of Qing as 'chen' at 3:00, but nowhere near as horrific as rendering Hong Tianguifu as 'hong tee-oo-gee-foo'.\n\nThe 'short bursts of Taiping resistance' which the narrator at 3:18 mentions as lasting until 1866 were not actually that at all. Rather, they were the southern elements of the Taiping which had not arrived to relieve Nanjing and still held territory, to whom Hong Rengan attempted to flee with Hong Tianguifu after the capital fell. Indeed, some more optimistic people like Lindley continued to believe that the southern remnants could hold on and establish themselves in the coastal provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, whilst some more cynical observers suggested that Zeng Guofan might even have let these remnants be for a while whilst he himself usurped the throne. One Taiping-affiliated group, the Black Flag Army, was even co-opted by the Qing to fight their proxy war against France in North Vietnam.\n\nAnd then the video ends. No discussion of the relevance of the Taiping to either the fall of the Qing Dynasty or modern China,  or, disturbingly, of the estimated 20 million death toll. I'll admit now that for the first 30 seconds I thought this was actually going somewhere. Now I'm just a bit disappointed.",

Which is incorrect.\n\n\n&gt;'When the the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 and the Empire's western provinces were conquered by barbarians, Constantine's eastern capital remained the seat of the Roman Emperors.'\n\n\n1)The way they're saying this implies it all falls in 410. It doesn't, there's another 66 years left.\n\n2)There was more than one Emperor. I mean, post 410, you've got a lot of Roman Emperors still around who /aren't/ in Constantinople. They should have really clarified that they meant the Eastern Roman Emperors. \n\n\n&gt;they use the togas like classical rome\n\n\n? Toga's fell out of fashion around Justinian's time and were largely replaced by the tunica\n\n\n&gt;working class byzantines did the same jobs as roman ones [...] fishing [...] silk weaving\n\n\nClassical romans did not engage in silk weaving. Kinda hard when silk worms weren't nicked from China till the 6th century.\n\n\n&gt;Alexiad\n\n\nNot too much wrong here, bar the visual presentation of Anna writing it during her father's rule. Mainly since she wrote it in the 1140s-1150s, during the latter stages of her life, expanding on the work of her dead husband. Dad was dead since 1118.\n\n\n\n&gt;fourth crusade \n\n\nEh, the video presents it as the crusaders being bribed, then wrecking Constantinople out of anger. Instead of, ya know, being in debt and running out of supplies with the eventual taking of the city in 1204 being the only option left to them after the deposing of their benefactor.\n\n\nAlso find it weird that this 'rise and fall' is just ignoring the Sassanids, Turks, Arabs etc. Crusaders get a mention, then 1453 gets a mention.  What, no time for the attempted reconquest of the west or the 10th century golden age? The Komnenian restoration? Manzikert?\n\n\nNope, it's just presented as going strong till 1204. Odd.",

This month's turn is [Odin](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/8g06tf/til_that_if_the_genealogy_of_the_early_germanic/?st=jgtuudx5&amp;sh=c876c84b). Last month, it was Muhammad. Now I cannot find the post anymore, but Elizabeth's claim of descent from Muhammad seems to be reposted once every year. This time, the excuse was that it has supposedly recently [gone viral](https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21739990-reaction-queens-purported-muslim-extraction-has-been-varied-arab) in the Muslim world and that this means Prince Charles will claim the Caliphate when his mother finally lets him play with her things, or something.\n\n&gt;Her bloodline runs through the Earl of Cambridge, in the 14th century, across medieval Muslim Spain, to Fatima, the Prophet’s daughter. Her link to Muhammad has previously been verified by Ali Gomaa, the former grand mufti of Egypt, and Burke’s Peerage, a British authority on royal pedigrees.\n\n&gt;Much hinges on a Muslim princess called Zaida, who fled a Berber assault on her home town of Seville in the 11th century and wound up in the Christian court of Alfonso VI of Castille. She changed her name to Isabella, converted to Christianity and bore Alfonso a son, Sancho, one of whose descendants later married the Earl of Cambridge. But Zaida’s own origins are debatable. Some make her the daughter of Muatamid bin Abbad, a wine-drinking caliph descended from the Prophet. Others say she married into his family.\n\nUnfortunately, this is very easy-to-prove bullshit without even getting on the matter of Zaida's parentage.\n\nThere were two [Earls of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Cambridge) in the 14th century. The first one, [William of Julliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_V,_Duke_of_J%C3%BClich) (1299-1361), received the title in 1340 but did not pass it to his children. The second, [Edmund of Langley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_of_Langley,_1st_Duke_of_York) (1341-1402), was also the first Duke of York and the founder of the House of York that would fight the houses of ~~Lannister~~ Lancaster and Tudor in the Wars of the Roses. I suppose this is the one Elizabeth II is descended from. Edmund of Langley was married to Isabella of Castile, who was an illegitimate daughter of King Peter I of Castile, and through him, a direct descendant of King Alfonso VI *of León* and Castile. Success! ...Except for one fact: Isabella of Castile **was not** a descendant of Zaida.\n\nYou may have heard of [Alfonso VI of León](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_VI_of_Le%C3%B3n_and_Castile) (1040-1109). He's the asshole king who killed his brother to take over Castile and exiled El Cid in the *Cantar* and *Age of Empires II*, a claim that merits its own post. \n\nAlfonso VI married 14-year-old Agnes of Aquitaine, daughter of Duke William VIII, in 1074. Unfortunately, Agnes died without issue in 1078, just as she was turning legal. Alfonso did not suffer the loss much, however, as he had his mistress Jimena Muñoz, a Galician noblewoman who birthed two daughters: Elvira Alfónsez (1079-1157), who married Duke Raymond IV of Toulousse; and Teresa Alfónsez (1080-1130), who married the knight Henry of Burgundy and was given a little Galician county called Portugal as their wedding gift.\n\nIn 1079, Alfonso VI married for a second time, to Constance of Burgundy (1046-1093), daughter of Duke Robert I. They had six children, but only one of them survived to adulthood: Alfonso VI's eventual heir, Queen [Urraca I of León](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urraca_of_Le%C3%B3n) (and Castile) (1081-1126). It is Urraca and her mother, Constance, that Peter I and his daughter Isabella descend from, not Zaida and her son Sancho.\n\nSo who was Zaida, anyway?\n\nWhen Alfonso inherited León from his father in 1065, he also inherited the vassal relation that the Muslim kingdom of Toledo had with it. In 1084, the people of Toledo rose against King al-Qadir, who asked Alfonso (his feudal lord) for assistance. The (also Muslim) King of Seville, al-Mutamid, allied with Alfonso and attacked Toledo from the south. But instead of restoring al-Qadir to the throne, Alfonso annexed Toledo for himself and sent al-Qadir to Valencia to rule there as king, and more importantly, Alfonso's vassal. Since Toledo was the capital of the old Visigothic Kingdom, Alfonso decided it would be a good time to call himself *Imperator Totius Hispaniae* (i.e. Emperor, or High King of all Spain, aka the whole Iberian Peninsula, although some say he was already using the title since 1077) and he doubled it by also calling himself Emperor of the Two Religions, i.e. Christians and Muslims.\n\nNow this kinda scared the fucking crap out of al-Mutamid, but more importantly it also got on the way of al-Mutamid's own [little project](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Mutamid#/media/File:Reino_de_Sevilla_s._XI.svg) of reunifying Muslim Spain with himself as its king [EDIT: NOT caliph. al-Mutamid's grandfather and father had used a fake caliph to seize power in Seville after the collapse of the Cordoban Caliphate in 1031. While they belonged to an Arab family, they were not descendants of the Prophet and never claimed to be]. In Africa, the Almoravids were on the rise and al-Mutanmid invited them to stop Alfonso and maybe also fight the other Muslim kings of Iberia. Unfortunately, by the third Almoravid landing the Almoravids decided that al-Mutamid was of no use to them, and they also invaded his lands. While al-Mutamid was quartered in Seville, his son al-Mamun was tasked with defending Cordoba from the Almoravids coming from Granada. al-Mamun sent his wife, Zaida, to a castle in Almodovar and petitioned Alfonso VI for help. However, the Almoravids took Cordoba and killed al-Mamun before Alfonso's army got there, then proceed to Seville, where they deposed al-Mutamid and deported him to Marrakech.\n\nZaida, however, managed to link with the Christian army and was evacuated to León. Some say, with her children, but there doesn't seem to be a record of them. While in Alfonso VI's court, she converted to Christianism and took the name, funnily enough, of Elizabeth aka Isabella. Around the time of Queen Constance's death in 1093, she also became a mistress to Alfonso and bore him an adknowledged bastard son, Sancho Alfónsez. She's defined as such, mistress, in most sources of the time. And while some do say she's the daughter of al-Mutamid (and a later legend even claims that al-Mutamid paid Alfonso a fabulous dowry for her marriage), it seems pretty obvious that she was actually just his daughter-in-law. According to a contemporary Christian chronicle, her father was some \"Auenalfage\". This was identified by 20th century Medievalist Menéndez Pidal as al-Hayib, the Muslim king of Lerida [EDIT: A member of a Yemeni family and most likely not descended from Muhammad.]\n\nIn 1093, the just second-time-widowed Alfonso married for the third time to an obscure woman called Bertha, said to be from Tuscany by contemporary sources. Later historians identified her as a niece of Count Peter I of Saboy. Bertha died without issue in 1099. And then things get more confusing.\n\nAlfonso VI married for a fourth time to a woman called Elizabeth (or Isabella) in 1100. If Bertha is obscure, this one simply appears out of nowhere, with writers over 100 years after her death making some unlikely, vague claims that she was from the French royal family. Some modern historians have proposed that this Elizabeth is none other than the other Elizabeth, i.e. Zaida, and that this marriage had the purpose of legitimizing Sancho Alfónsez so he could inherit his father's kingdom. There is some evidence that Zaida was buried with Alfonso VI and his wives, which would indicate that she indeed married him. But different tombstones for Elizabeth (Zaida) and (Queen) Elizabeth have also been found. So they were either two different people, or Zaida was buried two times, one separate from the king and another with him.\n\nThis second Elizabeth birthed two daughters: Sancha Alfónsez (1102-1125), who married Count Rodrigo González de Lara, and whose daughter Elvira Rodríguez was the second wife of Count Ermengol VI of Urgel; and Elvira Alfónsez (1103-1135) (yay for name originality) who married King Roger II of Sicily.\n\nAs for Zaida's son, Sancho Alfónsez, he fought for his father at the Battle of Uclés (1108), at the tender age of 15, and was killed without issue. So Sancho was not the ancestor of Elizabeth II, or anyone else. The only way Elizabeth II could descend from Zaida would be if the second Elisabeth/Isabella was really Zaida, which is not sure, and the descendants of those daughters that married into Catalan and Italian nobility later went on to marry into the English royal family, which seems unlikely [EDIT:The descendants of the one who married Roger II actually went extinct two or three generations later]. And it is not what the above article is claiming, anyway.\n\nWether married to Elizabeth A or Elizabeth B, Alfonso VI rewidowed and remarried again in 1108 to Beatrice, possibly a daughter of Duke William IX of Aquitaine. This time it was 69-year-old Alfonso who died within a year, in 1109, and Beatrice was sent back to her father.",

I personally believe Kanye West is stupid, ignorant, and also [potentially suffering from brain damage](https://www.spin.com/2016/09/kanye-through-the-wire-accident-not-fake/). However, these charges are largely irrelevant to the historical claim that in some way African-Americans collectively \"chose\" to be slaves. \n\nIf we choose to isolate our analysis of slavery to Atlantic Slave Trade, the most commonly accepted figure is that there was a minimum of at least 250 slave rebellions since the beginning of the practice. This figure was originally sourced by historian [Herbert Aptheker]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Aptheker) in his book *American Negro Slave Revolts*. The difficulty in arguing this point though, is that it is unclear what Kanye's criteria for what constitutes a \"choice\". Is 250 enough to refute his claim or will he and his newfound defenders claim that this \"low number\" shows how content and accepting slaves were?\n\nWould it matter to Kanye that it is believed that almost [100'000 slaves participated](https://books.google.com/books?id=R98CAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) in the Haitian revolution? or were these \"dragon energy free thinkers\" just the exception that proves the rule?\n\nWhat about the [30'000 to potentially 100'000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad#Arrival_in_Canada) american slaves who escaped to Canada?\n\nWhat about the abolitionists like [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass) or [Solomon Northrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup)? What does Kanye think of their resistance or their struggle?\n\nThis isn't the sort of discourse a sane society should be having. This sort of unfalsifiable drek is typically the sort of rhetoric that comes from 4chan nazis which Kanye is clearly either becoming or choosing to appear as. ",

This has long been the site of the major Australian memorial on the Western Front, as a result of this victory, and a new interpretive centre, named for Monash, was opened there.\n\nThis confluence of events and commemorations has brought about an unfortunate situation because John Monash had nothing to do with the improvised counterattack at V-B.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8g5jd1/bad_alternate_history_the_hot_war_by_harry/",
        "text": "For those unaware, Harry Turtledove is possibly the most well known, and certainly the most prolific, author of alternate history novels. His most well-known works are The Guns of the South, the Southern Victory series, and the Worldwar series.\n\nI've been a fan of Harry Turtledove for a very long time, but I hadn't read his most recent series. His works, especially the later ones, tend to have many formulaic elements that can get frustrating to read once you have them pointed out. However, I was recently gifted the first book of his newer series *The Hot War*, and decided to read it. \n\nIt's...got some issues. **Spoilers below**\n\n* For context, the premise of the book is that US forces are trapped and destroyed at Chosin reservoir during the retreat from North Korea instead of escaping, and Truman decides to use nuclear weapons on China to halt the Chinese advance, which leads to an escalation and the beginning of WW3. Now, this premise is fine, and most of the book is OK (I haven't finished it, so I may be wrong there)\n\nBut there are some *massive* issues with the book that warrant a post here\n\n**Nuclear Escalation**\n\nThough it's at the center of the plot, the escalation from the US attack on Manchuria to \"global nuclear war\" makes very little sense. To sum up the convoluted series of events: \n\n1. In retaliation for the attack on Manchuria, Stalin attacks mid-tier cities in Germany, Britain, and France with nuclear weapons\n2. Truman responds by nuking the Soviet airbase in former Finland that launched the attacks in Europe\n3. Stalin then retaliates by nuking an airbase in Alaska\n4. Stalin begins a conventional invasion of Europe, and the US nukes several logistics hubs\n5. Stalin launches a surprise nuclear strike on the US West Coast\n6. The US retaliates and destroys many Soviet cities\n\nThis bears very little resemblance to US nuclear doctrine. Although the \"Massive Retaliation\" policy wasn't fully put into effect until the Eisenhower administration, the outlines of the policy were very clear in 1951, when the book is set.\n\n1. The US has a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons, a very large long range bomber fleet, and remains committed to the strategic bombing doctrine that defined the air war during WW2.\n2. The Soviets are the only other country with any nuclear weapons, they don't have very many, and don't have many bombers or bases that can reach the US\n3. The USSR has a significant conventional edge over US and allied forces in Europe\n\n\nThe logical conclusion to this dilemma is the one that the US settled on just two years after the start of the book - the US would respond to conventional weakness with its nuclear deterrent, a deterrent that the USSR could not match. Indeed, it's *what Truman did to provoke the conflict* - use nuclear weapons to combat conventional weakness in Korea.\n\nInstead of this logical response, we get a piecemeal escalation where Truman allows Stalin to match him on equal terms in the nuclear sphere, and while the US remains weaker in the conventional sphere. This continues even after the Soviets invade West Germany and war officially begins - rather than launching nuclear attacks on Soviet airbases in Siberia that could possibly strike the US mainland - or indeed, launching *conventional* attacks, Truman seems content to do minor logistical damage to the Soviets in Eastern Europe and to launch conventional bombing raids on Soviet cities.\n\nI know nothing about Soviet nuclear doctrine at this point of history, but a suicide attack on the US West Coast doesn't seem to be particularly logical for him, either. Rather than throwing away his bombers and arsenal on an attack that could only partly damage the US, it would seem far more logical for Stalin to destroy major ports, airbases, and enemy armies so that his conventional forces could take Europe before American reinforcements could arrive.\n\nAs a final note for this section, the book is set before modern taboos about the use of nuclear weapons developed. Our reverence toward nuclear weapons only developed as MAD became a reality and nuclear weapons became more powerful - in 1951 few knew that the American mainland could possibly be struck by nuclear weapons, and the actual destructive power of a nuclear bomb was limited. The bombs had been used just six years before, were a mainstay of American military doctrines, and their ultimate destructive power was on the scale of major conventional bombing raids, rather than the hydrogen bombs we know today. \n\n**Capitalists don't have radar**\n\nNow, you may be thinking after reading the previous section \"but wait, how on earth did Stalin manage to pull off three separate surprise nuclear strikes\"? Well, Turtledove has an answer for you:\n\n1. The main Soviet strategic bomber was the TU-4, a reverse-engineered copy of the B-29 that was nearly identical\n2. The Soviets painted them with US colors\n\nThat's it. The Soviets managed to launch a surprise nuclear strike on the West Coast, at night and during wartime, by painting their bombers to look like US bombers. After they did the same thing twice before. Oh, and multiple POV characters (at least three) openly voice their concerns about this exact ruse.\n\nThe bad history here is simple - *radars existed*. Turtledove even mentions that US aircraft and ships are equipped with radar, and that specialized night-fighting interceptor aircraft exist for this exact reason. So it's baffling why this Soviet ruse would work multiple times - it should have failed the first time it was tried, when American interceptor pilots spotted unidentified aircraft on radar at night and the aircraft in question didn't know any codes or even speak English.\n\n**Asiatic Hordes**\n\n&gt; \"Urra! Urra!\" The chant got louder, and higher in pitch. He knew what that meant. \"They're coming!\" he bawled, and peeped out behind the Mercedes again. Coming they were, and just as he remembered from the old days: rank after rank of men, arms linked... - *Turtledove 171*\n   \n.\n\n&gt; But the rest of the Red Army men closed ranks, linked arms, and came on. They were as impervious to doubt or damage as they had been on the *Ostfront* a few years before. Vodka and fear of their own secret police both had to play a part in that - *Turtledove 209*\n\nYour brave hero is Gustav Hozzel, a *Wermacht* veteran of the *Ostfront* who volunteered for a militia company after the Soviets invade West Germany (and who the Americans inexplicably equip with a Springfield bolt-action in 1951, but I digress...).\n\nThe Soviet army in 1951, despite being just a few years removed from being arguably the largest and most veteran fighting force in human history, has apparently decided to eschew armored vehicles, machineguns, artillery, or the very concept of cover. No, the New Soviet Man links arms with his fraternal comrades and marches toward machineguns while drunk off his ass and singing songs. Just as he did in 1944, when our friend Gustav was wounded while defending...Poland.\n\nThe badhistory is again simple - the Soviets absolutely *did not* make a common practice of charging trenches with arms interlinked and when drunk. There are reports of some Soviet formations doing that in the bad old days of 1941, but for most of WW2 the Soviets attacked with massive superiority in armor and artillery, using veteran soldiers to attack in the smart, intelligent ways that veterans conduct attacks against machineguns.\n\nThe Soviet army in 1951 would still be chock full of veterans from the Great Patriotic War, and was very large and very well equipped with heavy weaponry. Turtledove provides *some* justification by claiming that Soviet armored divisions were out of fuel thanks to American logistics warfare (apparently the USSR was not introduced to the concept of supply depots?), but his use of Nazi stereotypes of Russian soldiers as drunk barbarians who attacked in suicidal human wave attacks is inexcusable for somebody who has studied WW2 as much as Turtledove has\n\n\nThere's almost certainly much more badhistory to talk about in this book, but the three points above were the most egregious examples I saw in the book. \n",

        "text": "Between a few various videos and random quora articles about JFK, I would like to just dispel some myths about this President and why I think it's ridiculous that he's given such a mythologised view. Whether or not this is deserved is entirely worthy of another post, I'm just going to debunk and give perspective to these inaccurate views of his Presidency.\n\nComments on this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-CAFX9XeM) video:\n\n\\&gt;  What I find most surprising is the visionary leadership that he is NOT remembered for ...and which is not mentioned in this video.  His plan to prevent future war was total disarmament.  Today people freak out if you mention nuclear disarmament.  JFK pushed for disarmament of both conventional and nuclear weapons.  And this was not a plan that he kept hidden in his desk drawer.  He boldly presented this proposal in a speech to the UN General Assembly, for all the world to hear.﻿ \n\nThere's a clear difference between JFK's address and his policy, and also the meaning of the address itself. Firstly, the policy of JFK was absolutely \\*not\\* anti\\-nuclear. He campaigned in the 1960 election on a 'missile gap', claiming the USA needed to enlarge its stockpile of nuclear missiles in fear of the Soviet Union catching up, which was not true. In the Cuban missile crisis, the US entered DEFCON 2, with strategic bombers ready. During JFK's tenure, the US developed the doctrine of Flexible Response and Counterforce, a doctrine emphasising combined conventional and nuclear response to communist aggression. Nuclear weapons tests continued at a normal rate under Kennedy. \n\nTo claim his UN speech is proof of willing disarmament is ridiculous too, and reminds me of how tankies often point out some soviet peace offensive as proof of their innocence. It's incredibly easy to make a peace proposal in a tense situation, because it would be strategically disadvantageous for both parties, so the other party will decline \\- but this was expected, and merely a propaganda ploy to make the others look bad. We don't claim Eisenhower was some anti\\-nuclear visionary because he proposed Open Skies.\n\n\\&gt;  President John Fitzgerald Kennedy accomplishments!   #1 He was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism during World War II.   #2 John F. Kennedy is the youngest ever elected President of the United States.   #3 He took the U.S. economy out of recession through his reforms.   #4 He established the Peace Corps in 1961.   #5 JFK averted nuclear war through his negotiations with Soviet leader Khrushchev.  #6 He contributed in the formation of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.   #7 He initiated the Alliance for Progress for development of Latin America.  #8 Wide range of important reforms were carried out during his term.  #9 He worked towards civil rights for African Americans.  #10 He was responsible for the Equal Pay Act of 1963.   #11 Boosted the Space Program by challenging the US in 1961 to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade.\n\nThis is a long one.\n\n1 and 2 have nothing to do with his Presidency.\n\n3 is *very* dubious, yes there was a [recovery shortly after JFK became President](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-09-at-4.58.24-PM.png), but it was clearly in line with the business cycle of the 50s, and the highest approximate GDP growth can be attributed to Johnson. In terms of economic management, JFK was just competent in the era of greatest US prosperity.\n\n4 seems pretty weak. The Peace Corps aren't exactly a major thing we remember... nor do we remember JFK as a dove.\n\n5... After escalating the crisis? I'll admit that historiography of the Cuban Missile Crisis is at times unfavourable to JFK, most attribute Castro's behaviour as being associated with the assassinations \\(although started under Eisenhower, nonetheless continued freely under Kennedy\\) and the Bay of Pigs. In addition the crisis was resolved with a net loss for the US \\- although the Soviet missiles were removed, they had not been there before, Cuba remained a ML state and the missiles in Turkey were removed. Socialism had succeeded in the US' underbelly.\n\n6 is fair enough.\n\n7 is similar to 4. So what? There have been other equally and more and less successful successive organisations in Latin America. Perhaps a list could include SEATO or CENTO.\n\n8 is just vague crap.\n\n9 is an interesting one. After the relative neglect of the Eisenhower years, JFK definitely was a more pro\\-civil rights President than Eisenhower, and Truman, and he was responsible for initiating the Civil Rights Act. Nonetheless, JFK sought to marginalise the role of black protesters in the March on Washington. In 2018 when we condemn Trump for taking both sides, I think a similar accusation could be made to JFK who was willing to consider the needs of the South.\n\n10 is a fine and fair point.\n\n11 is probably a fair point, although NASA was founded and funded by Eisenhower first and foremost. JFK did initiate the moon process so it can probably be accepted as his achievement.\n\nThen, from this [quora article](https://www.quora.com/Was-JFK-the-most-overrated-president-in-American-history).\n\n\\&gt;  5. He was the first President to participate in live unrehearsed televised press conferences \n\nThis has nothing to do with his quality as a President.\n\n\\&gt;  7. He successfully pressured Bethlehem Steel and US Steel to cut their prices; \n\nI seriously question whether this is a measure of a good President. Can you imagine the furore if Obama had demanded healthcare providers lower their prices to keep Obamacare popular, or if Trump demanded steel manufacturers stopped overseas developments? Both are met with scorn and derision by economists and their political enemies, JFK failing to resolve the growing inflationary crisis does not deserve him credit.\n\n\\&gt;  8. By executive order, he ordered an end to racial discrimination in housing owned, operated, or financed by the federal government;\nFair enough, although it's pretty limited compared to Truman and the army or Eisenhower and the schools.\n\n\\&gt;  10. He sent federal troops into Mississippi to integrate the University of Mississippi. \n A precedent already established by Ike. It was shocking and awesome when Eisenhower did it in Little Rock, but federal enforcement of Supreme Court rulings should not be considered a major accomplishment 10 years later.\n\n\\&gt;  11. He demonstrated that a Roman Catholic could serve as President without seeking to impose his religious teachings on the nation. \n This is reasonable enough.\n\nPerhaps a more entertaining activity would be doing this for some of America's less accomplished or qualified Presidents...\n\n1. He passed SALT I\n2. He created the Office for Minority Business Enterprise\n3. He went to China\n4. He protected the executive branch from an overreaching and elitist Congress\n5. He was the first President to resign for the good of the nation\n6. He introduced affirmative action, benefiting millions of minorities\n7. He successfully introduced wage and price controls in response to inflation\n8. By executive order, he created the EPA\n9. He peacefully and successfully resolved the Yom Kippur War\n10. He defended Chile from communist takeover\n11. He demonstrated that they wouldn't have dick to kick around again, because he'd win\n\nOr perhaps...\n\n1. He ingeniously defended his life from the Vietnam War by protecting his bone spurs\n2. He is the oldest ever elected President\n3. He oversaw the lowest ever black unemployment rate\n4. He appointed a qualified conservative supreme court judge\n5. DJT avoided nuclear war through his negotiations with Kim Jong Un\n6. He contributed in the formation of the European Army\n7. He defended America's borders from dangerous Sudanese refugees\n8. Wide range of important reforms were carried out during his term.\n9. He worked towards civil rights for white Americans.\n10. He was responsible for the Trump tariffs.\n11. Boosted the US military by defending against trans people.\n\nTurns out you can make a list of 'accomplishments' for anyone. The reality is a President has to be considered in context: between LBJ and Eisenhower, I don't think JFK stacks up in any list of his accomplishments.",

        "text": "First time, long time so hopefully my formatting works.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf you browse Alternate History forums you'll notice there are a few Alternate Histories so infamous that you say just one word and people instantly know what you're talking about. Sealion, Frisian Islands, Draka, and well, [Great Iraq War](http://archive.today/uQUJm) to a lesser extent.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's an alternate history where not only does it immediately involve time-travel it also involves Iraq fighting the Coalition Forces in the 1991 Persian Gulf War to a draw in a very improbable and mostly impossible way. But while other alternate histories have been very easily torn to shreds most people just look at this one, laugh, and move on but I always wanted to take a deeper dive into it. Not only is it completely dumb but it's also based on incredibly flimsy historical ground that already makes the starting (non-time travel) divergence point preposterous but also means I can actually call it out for bad history.  While a point-by-point breakdown would be enjoyable it would take far too long and also I don't really know that much about Iraqi Electronics Manufacturing Capabilities of the late 80's so for this I'll just pick apart the most obvious and easily disprovable elements.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt;1986\n\n&gt;    January 13: Mohamed Omar draws up a treaty to end the Iran-Iraq War. The treaty puts national borders back to pre-war boundaries but on the condition that Iran agrees to give 75% of their capital made by the oil industry. \n\n&gt;    January 23: Mohamed Omar shows his plan to Saddam Hussein who after nearly four hours of debating agrees to the terms and sends the treaty to Iran. \n\n&gt;    January 24: Iran accepts the treaty and the Treaty of Baghdad is signed.   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSection 1. The proposed truce with Iran in January 1986 is already horrendously improbable as by that time in the Iran-Iraq War Iran was already on the offensive and were planning on taking strategic Iraqi territory the very next month (Operation Dawn 8 to take the al-Faw Peninsula). It wasn't until 1987-88 that the Iranian offensive bogged down and the Iranians began to look for an out from the war, both due to war weariness as well as from a threat of a separate war with the United States. Given the 1986 circumstances Iran doesn't stand to gain much from a treaty especially if they believe they now have a momentum advantage over Iraq, especially since the conditions involve Iran giving Iraq 75% of it's yearly oil money for the (presumable) next decade. When Iran accepted the actual 1989 UN ceasefire it was actually expecting Iraq to have to pay them for their damages which makes in this timeline Iran quickly agreeing to pay heavy war reparations very hard to swallow.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 1987\n\n&gt;    January: Seal Six infiltrates the Lima Army Tank Plant and another Splinter Cell known as Eagle Seven infiltrates the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant. \n\n&gt; April 8: Saddam Hussein receives word that the M1A1 plans have been acquired. He orders the plans set before him with his top advisors with him. Mohamed Omar says that he should begin production of the M1A1. Hussein agrees and orders the M1A1 to be produced under the name T-87 Babylon. \n\n&gt; July 7: The Iraqi Army makes the T-87 their main battle tank.\n\n&gt; December 15: Iraq's T-87 count is up to 100.   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSection 2. Going by later Iraqi Armor numbers in the timeline Iraq is somehow to able to produce at least 10,000 T-87's in less than 3 years, which is surprising since in real life Iraq's own attempts at copying the Soviet T-72 tank in the form of the Lion of Babylon tank resulted in less than a couple dozen examples made in that same period of time (Russia claims at most 100 but that's at its most optimistic). As you can expect Iraq lacked both the capability and resources to start manufacturing tanks domestically on such a large scale. It is also said the T-87 and M1A1 Abrams are identical and thus have equal parity despite the fact the American M1A1 would have significantly more advanced electronics, much better trained crews, and most of all Depleted Uranium rounds which would be impossible for Iraq to produce (at least this quickly even in this timeline). It should also be noted that the United States itself has produced only 10,000 M1 Abrams of all variants since 1979, so 10,000 T-87's in just 3 years would be herculean even for a manufacturing power like the United States.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;1990\n&gt;May 28-30: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says that oil overproduction by Kuwait and United Arab Emirates is \"economic warfare\" against Iraq. Mohamed Omar supports him.\n&gt;July 15: Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing oil from Rumaylah oil field near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border and warns of military action.\n&gt;July 22: Iraq begins deploying troops to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border and building a massive military buildup.\n&gt;August 2: About 100,000 Iraqi troops invade Kuwait. Kuwait is in Iraqi control by the end of the day.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSection 3. Between having 75% of Iranian oil moneys as well as making money selling electronics and tanks to the Soviet Union, this timelines reasons for the actual invasion of Kuwait make little sense. In real life Iraq invaded Kuwait for multiple reasons but a lot of it had to do with all the debt Iraq incurred during the Iran-Iraq war, a lot of it owed to both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the tune of 86 billion in 2018 US Dollars. (Note, looking online I'm seeing all sorts of numbers of how much Iraq owed that range from 40 billion to 200 billion but my source says it was 40 billion at the time which is about 86 billion in 2018 dollars) which they tried to get them to waive as Iraq claimed it was sapping their economy. Iraq also claimed Kuwaiti oil overproduction as well as their slant drilling into Iraqi oil fields was costing them tens of billions a year they could be using to repay their debts. However if Iraq suddenly has more sources of income, then invading Kuwait to help their own economy makes absolutely no sense. In real life Iranian oil profit from 1986-1989 was about 40 billion (in 2018 US dollars), and taking 75% of that would be 30 billion US dollars for Iraq in their timeline. Plus with Iran oil profits going up almost 50% by 1990 it seems like it puts much less pressure on Iraq to invade Kuwait in this timeline.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;1991\n\n&gt;    January 15: Iraqi troops on the border prepare for battle and receive an extra ration. The SAM sites are put onto high alert and computers are hooked into the SAM radar stations to counter-act stealth bombers.\n&gt;    January 16: The Coalition in Saudi Arabia begins Operation: Desert Storm. The SAM sights hit the USAF and other air forces with deadly accuracy. Many planes are shot down by the SAM rockets. The IQAF (Iraqi Air Force) sends up fighters to hit the USAF but many of the fighters are shot down.\n&gt;    January 17: The USAF attempts to hit the Iraqi lines again but almost all of the planes sent and the helicopter sent are shot down by SAMs. The Iraqi Army launches SCUD missiles into the US lines and hit several UN troops. The majority are shot down though.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSection 4. A massive deal is made about how powerful the new Iraqi SAM launchers are but without effective RADAR they would be useless as the story doesn't mention them upgrading their existing RADAR networks besides with software updates. Despite being able to see through chaff and stealth technology they still wouldn't be able to as easily avoid the real-life Wild Weasel and other SEAD air missions that pounded the Iraqi defenses in the initial days. In the first hour of the actual Operation Desert Storm of Iraq's 100 RADAR sites, only 14 survived the initial attacks and after a week none remained. It was fundamentally bad tactics and doctrine that caused the destruction of the Iraqi Air Defenses in real life as opposed to just needing more SAM launchers, as RADAR sites found themselves quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of Coalition aircraft coming at them and struggled to vector in fighters and SAM sites to targets. Decision making was made at a general command rather than local level in terms of targeting which greatly slowed down response time and which the timeline doesn't address at all. In addition the story seems to focus on Iraqi shoulder-launched MANPADS being one of the deciding factors for the air war when in real life conditions they have a really poor track record against anything that isn't slow and flying at very low altitude.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;January 19: The UN decides that the air war isn't going well and launches the second phase of Desert Storm. Coalition ground troops surge forward in the greatest concentration of troops since WWII. The Coalition slams into the highly trained and waiting Iraqi Army. It quickly turns into an ugly brawl between two of the most powerful things on Earth. Many tanks on both sides are lost as well as many troops. The fighting became a long drawn out battle. By the end of the day the Coalition withdraws back to its lines.\n\n&gt;January 20: Protest against the war spring up in some places across America but it is not rampant. The Iraqi Army receives an extra ration and is visited by Mohamed Omar. The Coalition launches another offensive one hour after Omar left. It becomes another painfully bloody battle as SML rockets streak through the air and M1A1 rounds and T-87 rounds burst across the sky like fireworks, only deadly. The Coalition begins to make some headway and continues fighting in the night. They are still evenly matched as the USAF is unable to get through the SAM shield and the M1A1 and T-87 are practically identical. By morning the battle has turned into a stalemate.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSection 5. Another problem is the training and doctrine of the Iraqi Armored Forces which is never said to have been updated in the story. In real life Iraqi forces prepared a defense in-depth approach similar to what they did in the Iran-Iraq war, which meant they heavily relied on tanks in static positions as well as artillery pre-sighted into \"killing fields\". This was made completely useless by the rapid advance and flanking of the Coalition armies and almost all armor battles were horrendously one-sided with Iraqi tanks completely unable to hit Coalition armor due to poor training and positioning while being completely annihilated by armor on the move. It got to the point that some M1 Abrams tanks took to shooting their coaxial guns at the Iraqi tanks first which caused the Iraqi crews to immediately panic and escape from the vehicle allowing the Abrams to finish the now empty tanks off at their leisure.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;January 22: The Iraqi Army launches chemical missiles at the Coalition Army and many die before they're able to put their gas masks on. The Coalition launches an even more vigorous attack and attempt to break the Iraqi lines. Both sides fight to a standstill again and more lives are indiscriminately lost.\n&gt;January 23: The Coalition fortifies its position along the entire Iraqi border with Saudi Arabia and begins to solely use artillery to fight the Iraqis. The Iraqis respond in kind. Soon the war begins to look like something from 1916 in WWI. Soon the effects of shell shock begins to plague both sides.\n&gt;January 24: More protests occur in America and France. The Iraqi Army begins using chemical rounds from their artillery and the Americans begin to use in much greater numbers their 'steel rain'.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSection 6. Interestingly enough this is where you'd most be able to create a realistic timeline where Iraq was able to \"win\" the Gulf War. Coalition preparations for potential chemical and biological threats were rushed and shoddy at best. Lacking both anthrax vaccines for even a quarter of their soldiers as well as decontamination equipment, Coalition planners biggest fears were for a potential Iraqi biological and chemical weapons strike against marshaling yards or troop barracks in Saudi Arabia before the ground war started. A small yet concentrated attack by Iraqi aircraft and missiles could have postponed the ground invasion indefinitely. It got to the point that US President George H.W. Bush sent a direct message to the Iraqi government that strongly inferred a chemical or biological attack on Coalition forces would result in a tactical nuclear response on chemical and biological weapon locations. Saddam Hussein in response was very careful and explicit in saying any and all SCUD attacks would be completely conventional as he knew Baghdad would be specifically targeted in retaliation. A chemical weapons attack on Coalition troops would definitely result in more punishing measures as opposed to just more return artillery fire.\n\nSo that's that for the obvious stuff. I actually had 5 more planned bullet points listed but it took me long enough to write these out. Hopefully this works out.\n\nSources\n\n* \"Crusade - The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War\" by Rick Atkinson (1994) - For Sections 1 &amp; 3 \n\n* \"A History of Air Warfare\" by John Andreas Olsen (2010) For Section 4\n\n* \"M1 Abrams vs T-72 Ural: Operation Desert Storm 1991\" by Steven J.

        "text": "So Adam from Adam Ruins Everything has been doing a series of cartoons \"ruining\" history. [Here's the link to the original video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4THHeRJX8)\n\nVery little of what Adam says is actually inaccurate. It simply ignores so much vital context that I struggle to imagine how it could have been unintentional.\n\nLet's start with the missiles in Turkey.\n\n&gt;In 1961, JFK gave the order to put fifteen nuclear-tipped Jupiter Missiles on the Turkish Border. Khrushchev was furious!\n\n&gt;\"You mean to tell me that the US started it?\" \"Yep...\"\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here. Fist of all, the reason that the United States had stationed nuclear bombs in Turkey was because the Soviets had stated that they had ICBM's capable of hitting the United states. They did, but they exaggerated just how effective the missiles were. They took hours to launch, but the US didn't know that, so they put the missiles in Turkey as a deterrent. Secondly, there is a big difference between what the US did in Turkey and what the USSR did in Cuba. The US publicly announced that they would put them in Turkey ~~and got the approval of the UN~~ before doing that. The Soviets attempted to sneak medium-ranged missiles into Cuba in order to extort Berlin from the Americans. **The reason the Soviets needed to sneak the weapons into Cuba was because they had promised the USA that they would not put any \"offensive\" weapons in Cuba, which includes ballistic missiles.**\n\n&gt;In 1960, the US had over 18000 nuclear weapons, while the Soviets only had 1600. That's more than a ten-to-one advantage!\n\nFirst of all, the United States ~~had no idea~~ **was unsure of** ~~how many~~ **the full capabilities of the** nukes the Soviets had. Secondly, even if they did know, many of the US nukes were incapable of hitting the USSR.\n\n&gt;The blockade actually escalated the conflict. The US had no legal right to do it, so it was technically an act of war.\n\nI would argue that continually shipping missiles to Cuba was an escalation, and even possibly an act of war. The blockade (or ~~embargo~~ **quarantine** as they called it to avoid triggering a war) was ~~put in place as a relatively measured response to aggression~~ ~~**initially in place due to Cuba seizing land from American companies, but was turned into a de facto blockade.**~~ **put in place to stop any warheads from reaching Cuba, and acted successfully as a deterrent to Soviet ships (but not Soviet submarines).** **It is of note that the reason Castro wanted the missiles was so the US couldn't invade like it had in the Bay of Pigs.** \n\n&gt;Khrushchev: \"Tell USA we will take missiles out of Cuba when they take missiles out of Turkey. Khrushchev is reasonable man!\" \n\n&gt; Kennedy: \"We can't do that! If the public finds out I gave into this (totally reasonable) request, they'll think I'm a little softy baby boy.\"\n\nFirst of all, the total frantic nature of the Cuban Missile Crisis cannot be underestimated. The US received a letter which said that the USSR would pull the missiles out of Cuba as long as the US promised not to invade Cuba. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a broadcast from the USSR came demanding that the US both promise not to invade Cuba and to pull missiles out of Turkey. EXCOM was so confused by these messages' proximity and differences in tone that they speculated that Khrushchev had been taken out in a silent coup. Secondly, Kennedy was in favor of accepting the Soviet Union's second demand from the start. The reason he had to do it in secret was because Turkey was a NATO-member, and he had to preserve relations because he feared NATO breaking apart if the US didn't protect one of the members.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most egregiously, is Adam's portrayal of JFK.\n\n&gt;More than anything, Kennedy was worried about looking weak.\n\nNo. **Although Kennedy was a politician and almost certainly concerned about his PR,** from the beginning of the crisis to its conclusion, Kennedy was concerned about preserving peace without bending to the Soviets and placing his nation in a weak position. Kennedy did not \"almost cause World War 3\". Kennedy repeatedly sued for peace throughout the crisis and his portrayal in this video as a dim-witted strong man leader is very inaccurate. Khrushchev was similarly reasonable, even if his orders to put missiles in Cuba began the crisis. The real escalator of tensions was none other than Fidel Castro. ~~Not only did~~ Castro ~~order a strike on an American U2 reconnaissance plane, he also~~ actively campaigned for a nuclear first strike on the United States. He was at the center of the conflict and did everything within his power to end the world. \n\nOverall, this is an incredibly misleading portrayal of the Cuban Missile Crisis that I wouldn't even recommend for a kindergartener hearing about it for the first time. I may do more Adam Ruins Everything history videos in the future, because many of them are highly inaccurate or misleading.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.cubanmissilecrisis.org/background/\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/kennedy_cuban_missile_01.shtml\n\nhttps://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB393/\n\nThe Extra Credits series covering the Cuban Missile Crisis. [Link here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqJBibhR07w) It's a much better summary of the crisis, and I couldn't recommend the channel more. The thing that sets them above John Green and Adam Connover is that they spend multiple long episodes covering one event, giving very detailed summaries.\n\nSpecial thanks to u/Ask_If_I_Care, u/WardenOfTheGrey, u/AegonTheMeh, and u/Slick424 for their corrections. This is my first post, and I made a few errors; I'm just glad people caught them. ",
