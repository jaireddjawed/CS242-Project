Whenever Luffy does something that is reckless Nami gets angry every time and hits him for it and when Luffy can’t keep his mouth shut. I’m amazed that she hasn’t gotten use to his personality, maybe she has but still acts that way. She wants to see a change in him obviously but even if that did happen I don’t think she will like it and actually miss the old Luffy. Let’s say Luffy acts all mature and cooperative just out of nowhere, retreats from major enemies all the time, until one day he faces someone more powerful then Kaido or the Akainu, the reason I think why he always acts so reckless and picks fights with big foes is because after each fight he gets stronger and stronger and so does his crew mates, but if everything had it Nami’s way and things careful and peaceful the crew probably would’ve suffered in alabasta. do you really expect everyone in the straw hats to like a changed new Luffy, or do you think Nami should be the one who changes instead?",

We know there is a ruling class in baf due to Big Mom's plans with Loki. My theory is that the strawhats will change the ruling class and beat the corrupted system, but who will fight who. If there is an Odin then I'm sure Luffy and Shanks will be able to fight him but what about Loki? I think Usopp will fight him because Usopp is Heimdall.\n\nHeimdall's main ability is his acute godly senses mainly his eye sight. In the marvel  movies he can see over vast distanced and even communicate with people, in GOD ragnarok he is able to see the future. Heimdall is also known for carrying gjallarhorn, a horn that starts ragnarok and the power of the biforst including the rainbow bridge. Now how does Usopp play to this?\n\nUsopp has just recently unlocked Observation haki and we haven't seen him use it much. In Dressrosaa his observation was able to locate Law and Luffy's souls over a vast distance and accurately pinpoint it. In Wholecake Island we are introduced to future sight Haki which is just an advance form of it. In film red, Usopp's observation haki was able to sense and communicate with his dad even in another dimension and coordinate with him in real time. I truly believe Usopp will learn this and mastery this haki with his dadd training. What about the Biforst the rainbow Bridge? Usopp currently uses plants as ammo and when we see certain public gardens, they usually placed different colors of flowers in line to make a rainbow, just look it up. Usopp may get gjallarhorn but the army and strawhats can't get to the castle or tree, Usopp then creates a rainbow Bridge filled with flowers to carry them to Odin. And finally in mythology, Heimdall was the one who kills Loki so Usopp will defeat Loki.\n\nHope you enjoy my theory.",

        "text": "First of all, fuck these heathens who stand against the one true Lord God Usopp.\n\nSecond of all, all you people who say you hate usopp for being \"arrogant\" or saying some white lies here and there before water 7 need to check the author's name again. It's completely obvious that he's joking or written to do those things for comedic effect. Not once (iirc) did he lie or do something unscrupulous for his own gain, and his lies were always innocuous and pointless. If yall were consistent with how you take everything seriously, then maybe get mad at sanji for being a deviant and harassing women all the time before you sperg out on a guy lying about being the captain of a rag tag pirate crew (obviously i don't think that sanji is all those things but my point is that these traits and quirks are often overplayed by oda for comedic effect, stop being grouches).\n\nThird of all, i don't understand how many times it must be reiterated that Usopp's actions in Water 7 were TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE and the thing we should be feeling is sympathy for him. Here's a guy who tries his damndest to be of use to his crew, despite his fear of abandonment stemming from Yasopp, his cowardice (yes not everyone is shonen MC level fearless and reckless) and weakness overall. He truly cares for his crew which also at that point included the Going Merry - which was acknowledged by EVERYONE to be just as important a crew member as anyone else. And here he is, beaten and battered, still trying to save the Merry's life while being extremely depressed over losing the crew's money, when in comes Luffy - seemingly just as carefree and spontaneous as ALWAYS - to drop the mother of all revelations upon Usopp in the curtest most inconsiderate way possible. Now i'm no sycophant, if Usopp had calmed down and realized that everybody all agreed with Luffy and that might have been because Luffy was saying the truth and not being the child he is most of the time and remembered how Luffy has always affirmed his love for the Merry and how good a guy Luffy had always been, then he wouldn't or at least shouldn't have blown up the way he did. But after everything he went through, when he's at his very lowest, is it reasonable to expect Usopp to be reasonable at that moment? When Luffy just trotted in and drops a MASSIVE claim with no evidence other than \"oh the ship guys told us so\", would the better thing for Usopp to have done is roll over and let them fucking send Merry to the other side? REMEMBER that Luffy himself spazzed out when Paulie told him that the Merry can't be fixed and didn't believe him at first until he was told SPECIFICALLY what was wrong with the Merry and why it's completely unsalvagable. Usopp was told NONE of that.\n\nNow i hear you saying \"Usopp already knew the merry was done for, he was just being stubborn and wanted to drown everyone\". But first of all, he's not a shipwright, so technically he CAN'T know anything for sure since he lacks the training/knowledge to truly understand what makes a ship sailworthy; and secondly yeah of course you'd doubt yourself a lot when it comes to situations like this (not to mention that Usopp doubts himself and his judgment the MOST out of every character in the series at that point). All he truly knew was that the Merry is still here and it's still their precious crew mate, their nakama, if you will, and Luffy was just gonna throw it away over some rando shipwright's testimony (and distrusting those shipwrights wouldn't have been a bad thing to do mind you, a whole lot of them weren't what they seemed to say the least). Not only that, Luffy threatened to kick Usopp from the crew after they've quarreled for like 2 minutes (so much for captainly patience and empathy, somehow Luffy just couldn't grasp why Usopp would balk so much at the news, even though he reacted almost the exact same way lmao) - now if that isn't a perfect storm i don't know what is. Usopp might have, justifiably, feel as though he's seen Luffy's true self - being a super selfish guy who's willing to drop his crewmate at the drop of a hat for the sake of his adventure (WHICH IS TOTALLY WRONG BUT HE\"S COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED TO THINK THAT WAY AFTER WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED).\n\nAll in all, like Zoro had said,  NONE OF THIS MATTERS. Usopp had challenged Luffy to a duel, so who's right and wrong is irrelevant at that point. Some say Usopp knew he was too weak to win and just wanted to unburden the crew by exiting that way, while at the same time getting back at Luffy which at that point pretty much had BROKEN USOPP'S HEART with what he'd said. Again none of the arguments that precede this point matters anymore, they're in a duel with the terms set clearly, and only the result mattered.\n\nAt the end, I still think it was the right thing to do for Usopp to apologize since technically he's more at fault here (losing his cool, mutiny, being fake mean to Chopper), but here's another perspective: NOBODY IN THE STRAW HAT CREW THOUGHT OF HIM LESSER FOR APOLOGIZING. Now you guys may feel that it's demeaning, that Zoro wanted Usopp to grovel and beg, but truth be told it's what he should do. And doing something you should do is never something people should look down on you for doing. Also the way he apologized, you know, getting down on his knees and bawling, saying please take me back, again, there's absolutely NOTHING shameful about it - It's just how he truly feels and how genuinely he loves his fellow straw hats.\n\nThat's about it really, stop saying that Usopp was being unreasonable or was entirely at fault for instigating the fight, and it's totally cool that he apologized and he's a good person for doing that.",

No some people would be thinking “oh he’s paying respects to such a strong sword” but that’s not much like Zoro. Suddenly his neck pivots to be facing his opponent, while still eye-level with the blade, and as blood drips from his mouth and face, he opens his mouth, and clamps down on the handle of Yoru, he struggles to lift the massive weapon, but does. And in a moment of shock and awe, this would be so hype, in my opinion. He then defeats the opponent with the strength of that style.\n\nI know there’s going to be that one, “I’m glad OP fans don’t write OP” comment, but this isn’t fully supposed to be taken seriously, it’s just an off the cusp thought I had, remembering that animation form years ago. I personally think that would be awesome and incredibly hype, but if you don’t, I can see why",

I'm excited to combine my love of One Piece with my passion for server development and create something truly special.\n\nWe're currently in the super early stages of developing HarborMC, a One Piece themed Minecraft server, and we're looking for some talented and dedicated individuals to help us bring it to life. Specifically, we're currently seeking to fill two roles:\n\n**Developers**: We're looking for experienced developers who can help us enhance the One Piece experience for players. Developers will be responsible for designing and testing custom features, such as new items, quests, and gameplay mechanics. We're looking for developers who have experience with MythicMobs, Denizen, and other relevant plugins (Java and Minecraft plugin development experience is a massive plus!), as well as a passion for One Piece and a willingness to learn and experiment with new ideas.\n\n**Modelers**: We're looking for experienced modelers who can help us create custom skins, textures, and 3D models for Minecraft. Modelers will be responsible for creating custom armor sets, weapons, and items that are faithful to the One Piece source material and that enhance the player experience. We're looking for modelers who have experience with programs like Blockbench and Photoshop, as well as a keen eye for detail.\n\nWhether you're a developer or a modeler, we're looking for people who are creative, collaborative, and committed to creating a server that both captures the spirit of One Piece and provides a fun and engaging experience for players.\n\nSo if you're interested in joining our team and helping us build something truly special, please get in touch! You can contact us via our Discord server (link included below), where we'll be posting updates and coordinating our efforts.   \n\n\nIf you're not interested in applying and simply want to tag along and see how things go, that's fine! We've got tons planned (and I mean, **TONS**) for you all to indulge yourselves in, like a custom ship battling system, custom haki system, custom devil fruit system, and more!  \n\n\nJoin our Discord server @ [https://discord.gg/WyFaHaBtUX](https://discord.gg/WyFaHaBtUX)   \nContact me personally via Discord @ **hyper#5918**",

        "author": "Screen-Healthy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11c10yb",
        "text": "Hey, everyone.\nThis is my first Reddit post ever and I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now, so no, it’s not just break week happening.\n\nLike many of you I’m craving for some development for one of my favourite characters, the straw hats’ sniper: Ussop.\n\nOne of the things I’ve been thinking could come as a power-up for him, besides anything he might get from Egghead, though it might seem very late story-wise, is a devil-fruit. And I’ll tell you what fruit it could be and why.\n\nFirst of all, I believe it should be a fruit that improves his role as the sniper of the team, following on his father’s foot steps and his natural inclination as shown in the manga.\n\nSecond, it should fit his character traits and overall story arc, not forgetting his story so far but leading him to wherever he is planed to go.\n\nSo what fruit is it?\n\nThe Mushi Mushi no Mi, Model: Bonbarudiabītoru\n\nOr Insect Insect Fruit, Mode: [Bombardier Beetle.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle)\n\n(I kept the model’s name in Japanese because oddly enough [Oda kept the other Mushi Mushi fruit’s name in Japanese also](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Mushi_Mushi_no_Mi,_Model:_Kabutomushi).)\n\nAnd why?\n\nFirst because beetles seem to be related to Ussop in the story: his weapon shares the name with a beetle species, the Kabuto, [his master has a very clear beetle motif](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Heracles), the first animal he encountered in his 2 year long training was a giant beetle and so forth…\n\nAlso, he has some leaning towards nature and insects: he and Luffy fanboy towards beetles, his chosen weapons are plants, he used to set spider battles as a kid etc.\nBesides his friends, the Tonttata are sorta insect-like and are also the users of the other two insect fruits.\n\nOther than that there’s the obvious reason of the Bombardier Beetle’s main trait: they shoot.\n\nBombardier Beetles have a combustion chamber inside them, so when they mix naturally occurring chemicals on their body they cause an explosion, sometimes a lot of them, going as far as 500 a minute.\n\nThey can also aim in a number of directions, making them one of nature’s snipers.\n\nSo it would fit him.\n\nIn his human form he can stay crafty and friendly with his fellow nakama.\n\nI’m his hybrid form he could gain a better weapon, because let’s be honest: Oda won’t give him a gun and he can’t possibly fight endgame characters like his father and Van Augur with a sling shot.\nSo in his hybrid form he could gain a natural gun in his body, some sort of [megaman’s buster](https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Buster) in which he could load his vast arsenal of projectiles and pop greens and shoot them faster, stronger and cooler.\nHe would also gain a lot of resistance as a Zoan specially because [beetles have their armour.](https://www.insidescience.org/news/scientists-discover-secret-beetles-super-armor)\nSomething else is [the fact that beetles are very strong](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.2842936) so maybe he’d be able to actually lift a hammer weighting some tons. \n\nIn his animal form he would be very small and able to fly so he would be able to run and escape any battle or hazard he might fear, with an extra advantage if he so wants: he could live a life with the Tonttata once everything is over.\n\nSo, what do you guys think? Is it possible? Likely? Or is this just rambling from a delusional person?\nLet me know.\n\nSorry for the long post, I left a sniper potato for your patience.",

        "text": "One Piece has many strong female characters that are underappreciated because they don’t always portray physical and fighting strength. While physical &amp; fighting strength should be appreciated, mental &amp; emotional strength is as important. But to a shonen audience that fetishizes power levels, other kinds of strength that don’t involve punching, slashing, and kicking takes a backseat.\n\nOda has made it clear that being a mother and matriarch is one of the most significant roles in the story. Queen Otohime, Toki, &amp; Rouge, in particular, were strong mothers and matriarchs. Queen Otohime was central in keeping the hopes and dreams of the Fishmen alive. Without Toki, Oden’s will would’ve died with him in the past. Without Rouge, Ace would’ve never been born. All of those women made the ultimate sacrifice for something greater. They weigh heavily on the story, with power levels far below 9,000. \n\nThis brings me to Nami, our favorite navigator. Her detractors dismiss her as weak &amp; useless for her inability to punch, slash, &amp; kick her way out of trouble like the monster trio. On the other hand, her fans constantly lament her inability to fight like the boys, Robin, or Hancock, our favorite puppy kicker (j/k). During Wano, they criticized Oda for Nami’s fight against Ulti, not understanding that the point of the confrontation was to show the strength of Nami’s willpower and character, not her fighting strength. \n\nCarrying the burden of an entire village for many years, resisting becoming the thing you hate by staying true to your moral compass, and letting go of the past through forgiveness and hope for the future are all incredible feats of mental and emotional strength. So, Nami is one of the strongest characters in One Piece because her strength is all-encompassing. \n\nIn conclusion, Nami will undoubtedly get stronger with Zeus, and I think she possesses Conqueror’s haki. However, Nami was already a strong woman. Like Toki and Rouge before her, Nami is uniquely responsible for navigating Luffy to his destiny, and her map will be essential for his kingship.",

        "text": "Everybody remembers the infamous staredown between these two War Lords during Thriller Bark, yes? I will post the screenshot down below for easy reference. \n\nI believe Oda wrote the Yin and Yang of One Piece with these two characters. Moria represents Yin. \n\nThe darker half of the symbol, Yin\n It may represent feminitity, but it also represents darkness, passiveness, and stillness. Most of these traits can compare to Moira and his personality. He lives in the shadows, and he's extremely complacent. He has personal goals and he does not care who he uses, abuses, or steps on. His motto is also that of \"You do it yourself!\" \n\nThe lighter half of the symbol, Yang\nKuma can be an interpretation of every single trait regarding Yang. He is, ultimately, the movement. He can also represent activeness and hardness. The \"government dog\" clearly has his own motives whilst pursuing his higher ups desire. He is extremely devoted to his ideal of \"good\"\n\nBoth characters possess the main traits of Yin and Yang, respectively, but neither character is fully Yin or Yang. Just the exact symbol. Yin (Moira) and Yang (Kuma) have differing ideals, motives, and being indicitive to their own beliefs. But Yin and Yang both share ideals with their opposite beliefs.",

It's exactly the kind of prank Oda would pull to get people arguing about Crocodile's gender\n2. Ivankov can use his to make his hand into syringes, maybe S-Croc could use it to turn his hand into the poison-injecting hook or dagger the real Crocodile has\n3.

And on top of that his enemies also separated his memories from him using the Paw-Paw fruit. \n\nThen Joyboy's allies escape with a baby Joyboy and also managed to grab his memories as well. Then devise a plan to send Joyboy into the future for another shot.\n\nSince Joyboy's allies did not have the Paw-Paw fruit they weren't able to give Joyboy back his memories. They did in fact have the time time fruit and decided to send Joyboy and his memories into the future together.  \n\nMaybe using the lineage factor (Joyboys DNA) on top of using the Toki-Toki no mi they were able to send Joyboy to pinpoint location to any of his descendants aka Monkey. D Dragon so they know he would be safe. \n\nA younger Monkey D. Dragon finds him in the future, learns of the void century and what happened because Joyboy's memories are with him, decides to create the revolutionary army because he knows the truth and maybe to raise an army/ gain allies for Joyboy once he comes of age. \n\nThis would explain how Laughtale has a timeline of events that are going to happen in the future, aka the exact time Joyboy would return. (thats one of the biggest mysteries for me how Roger and Oden knew the exact time Joyboy would return from whatever they found on Laughtale)\n\nScenario B:\n\nVery similar to the top scenario but Joyboy and his allies have the Bonney fruit and the Paw-Paw fruit purposely making him into a baby and separating his memories and sending him into the future possibly to hide his identity from Imu and the World Government. \n\nBeing sent as a child on purpose is kind of the weak point in this scenario because why wouldn't he just stay in his strong adult form, but maybe it was to hide his identity or maybe they want to catch Imu and the World Government off guard. \n\n***Other important points:***\n\nDragons knowledge of Luffy and what hes supposed to accomplish to me is suspicious, how does he know so much?, examples in from this pictures. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2ulvtdrsdka1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=70fdf26fe9107c038e515cc3db5915802a889047\n\n[The world is awaiting our answer? ](https://preview.redd.it/we0l9s4psdka1.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c5a65005a8f9591f5e490b16ad7ae2121f28f7a9)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oo23xd9hsdka1.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=66f52c4b2aa93f0b5ca44fb4ae25cd38f30d5197\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1t7znvxsdka1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=96e69b60bf6efce16315c27d179cbc059f271975\n\nAll of these Dragon panels makes me assume that Dragon knows Luffy is going to be the one that frees the world or has a very important future, How is this possible, from what we've been given in the story Dragon has little to no upbringing of Luffy, so we can assume Dragon doesn't know Luffy's dreams or goals. And its like Dragon can't do it without Luffy. Thats why I believe Dragon may have found a baby Luffy, with void century knowledge on him whether that be through Joyboy's memories or some ancient texts/ future devices that were sent with him. \n\nWasn't it stated the World Government wanted Bonney because of how important her fruit was? Also her fruit is still unnamed why is that?\n\nGarp plot hole on how him and Luffy look like could be as simple as Luffy being Garps ancestor like I said with Dragon. \n\nImu has that big straw hat there chamber, and also may seem to know Luffy is Joyboy by seeing his wanted poster. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor the plot hole on why doesn't Dragon tell Luffy everything or help him, That part I still can't reason, but maybe Joyboy/Luffy needs to journey and grow on his own to develop into the person he was destined to be or maybe Dragon didn't want to draw attention to Luffy by having him with him since Dragon is the the World Government's most wanted criminal. \n\nI also believe that Dragon has a vivre card of Luffy just to track him and know his whereabouts just incase he needs a little help here and there like when he saved Luffy in Loguetown. \n\nIf I'm wrong about how the whole scenario happened, but right about Luffy being original Joyboy how cool would if be if theres a picture/statue of Luffy or maybe a video/hologram(since the ancient kingdom was so advanced) and this is what Roger sees on Laughtale and we actually get a scene of Roger kind of meeting Luffy in a sense and knowing one day hes going to free the world. \n\nThis would also explain why Roger and his crew were too early, not only was Shirahoshi not born, but Luffy had not arrived from the past to the future yet. Roger also asks about Shirahoshi  because maybe he thought he could accomplish freeing the world without having to wait for Joyboy. \n\nMaybe this also explains a connection to on why Luffy loves robots and technology so much too because hes from the past where they had all that in the Ancient Kingdom and it resonates with him on a deeper lvl. \n\nNow for everyone saying this would ruin Luffy's character and his Journey, I kinda don't see that because Luffy's journey in the whole story so far has been his own still, everything hes accomplished has been of his own accord and not someone telling him to do and maybe thats the key on why Dragon has not intervened.\n\nAnd how how mind blowing would it be for Luffy and us as the readers when he gets to Laughtale and sees himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This would be the reaction the whole crew would have if Luffy does have a statue of himself on the island or something lol](https://preview.redd.it/q64fyxr1jdka1.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=30a3ead1d3d18a76e0ebb591760c5cdb45b2d3c8)\n\nBiggest take aways again are, the mystery behind everyone saying Joyboy is going to return, how would he return? and how do they know the exact timeline for that? and Dragon's somewhat future knowledge on what Luffy is going to become and accomplish?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear anyone thoughts on this, if theres more evidence that suggest this could happen, or anything that completely destroys this theory all together. Again its just a fun theory don't take it too seriously.",

        "text": "I just rewatched the Skypia Arc and in Episode 194 (Chapter 301) there is a statement of Robin where she tries to understand Roger's words engraved in Gold next to the Poneglyph which indicates the location of Poseidon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 301 Roger's engraved words](https://preview.redd.it/s30sh002qdka1.png?width=1955&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c52300e6302a4fd61fca4faeee54f648b90846be)\n\nIf you watch episode 194, the translation of Roger's word's is as follows: \"I made it here. I will guide this text to the ends of the earth.\" The meaning is the same altough I find it more understandable. (Maybe because I'm not english native) Anyway,\n\nThere she tries to interpret those words in one \"spatial aspect\". \n\n[Chapter 301 Robin tries to interpret Roger's word's](https://preview.redd.it/3kc1wso5sdka1.png?width=1655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=592123e3ab2b8a9c8a5d1e2f6a3514689c1dc623)\n\nMeaning that she expects the Rio Poneglyph to be located somewhere.\n\nBut saying a sentence with \"To the ends of the world/earth\" can be seen in two ways.\n\n1.  \"spatial aspect/perspective\" like concluded by Robin that something is located somewhere at the end of the world.\n2. \"time related aspect/perspective\" If you expect all people to love each other and there to be no more war on earth, you must first reach the end of the world and wait for the Last Judgment.\n\nThe Last Judgment takes its name from the last day of world history. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the term stands for the final completion of history by God as judge (judgment of God).\n\nThere is a Bible passage to this \"time related aspect/perspective\", see 2.\n\n**Bible Verse Mk 13,24-27:**\n\nBut in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.\n\nWhat I conclude is, Roger couldn't be JoyBoy but he reached the end of the world but the final completion of history through God(Roger couldn't be JoyBoy) as judge couldn't be completed.\n\nBut if Luffy as JoyBoy will reach the end of the world and wait for the Last Judgement the final completion of history through God (in this case Luffy) will be completed and all people will love each other and there will be no more war on earth.\n\nI know this may be stretched out too long but yeah I would like to know your opinions on this.\n\nCredits to pics of chapter 301: u/TCBScans",
