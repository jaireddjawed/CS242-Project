        "text": "So when I was 15 years old I made a junior national volleyball team that originated out of Southern California and we traveled to Europe to play in a giant international tournament over the summer. The girls on the team were all older than I was and because of that they didn’t seem to like me that much. They would mess with my stuff by hiding it or moving it around. They would boss me around or leave me alone when we were allowed to walk around the cities. The ringleader would always make me do everything for her. Every game day we would have to walk from where we were staying to the gym about a mile away. Every game day she would yell at me to grab her jersey for her. I did it every day so that the bullying wouldn’t be worse. \n\nOne day we were in Bled Slovenia on one of our days off and we were swimming in a lake. In the middle of the lake is an island with an old church and you can rent little boats to paddle out to the island and explore the church but it was also possible to swim to. Well the team decided to rent a boat to go but not all of us could fit so half of the girls decided to swim there and then the other half would swim back. On my way back I had to swim. I’m not the best swimmer but thought I could do it. About halfway there I realized I was having a lot of trouble and kept going under the water and felt like I was drowning. I called out to my team on the boat asking if I could hold on to the side and the ringleader says “No, you’ll tip the boat” and they kept paddling away. I was shocked. I was obviously struggling and they left me there to potentially drown. When I finally made it to the shore exhausted and out of breath I was so angry. \n\nThe next day we had a game and the girl demanded I grab her jersey. We walked the entire way to the gym and sat down. When the coach asked us to go change into our jerseys the girl looked at me and said ok hand me my jersey. I looked at her and said “oh I didn’t grab it”. She looked at me furiously and had to tell the coach she didn’t have her jersey. She had to walk all the way back to our place to get it and missed the first game. ",

        "text": "I'm a Hong Konger currently studying overseas in Australia.  Naturally, I can speak Cantonese.  However, due to my schooling, I also speak English fluently.  \n\n\nTo set the scene: I was in Hurstville two weeks ago, looking for a few drinks from HK and a certain brand of instant noodles that I'd craved for quite a while now. (Side note: no offence to any Aussies reading this, but the brands that you'd find at your friendly neighbourhood Woolies and/or Coles are crap - Nissin Cup Noodles for the win!)   After a bit of walking, I spot an Asian Grocery Store™, and dart in to take a look, quickly spotting the drinks I want (gotta love VLT!).  I'm trying to figure out whether to get the tetra paks or bottles when a friend of mine calls me, and I answer her call in English.  Keep this in mind, because it comes into play later.  \n\nAfter a brief chat, I bid my friend farewell and hang up.  I'm just about to resume browsing the shelves, when I hear *them.* \n\nTwo middle-aged women, pointing out various store-goers and not-so-subtly casting aspersions on any part of them that didn't meet their esoteric standards (read: pretty much everything).  Now, if there's one stereotype that's true about most older Chinese women, it's that they are super judgemental and gossipy.  They can and will comment on basically everything about you.  Your looks, behaviour, appearance, mannerisms, the clothes you wear... everything.  \n\n\nThey moved from target to target with an efficiency that would put Navy SEALS to shame, and soon I was on their metaphorical chopping block.  For context, I'm wearing a pair of hiking pants, a short-sleeved shirt, and a nice pair of sneakers.  Not exactly the pinnacle of fashion, but comfy - especially during this unusually warm spring day.  While I've forgotten their specific phrasing, I do remember one of them talking about how I was dressed 'scruffily', and the other promptly dismissing me as a 'good for nothing banana'.  For those of you who aren't aware, 'banana' is a rather derogatory term for an Asian person born/raised in a Western country (e.g., an Asian Australian) - specifically, one who has 'lost touch' with the cultural identity of his or her parents/grandparents/great-grandparents/ancestors.  Or in other words, 'yellow on the outside, white on the inside'.  \n\n\nI must admit, they were being pretty clever about it.  They spewed their insults in hushed tones while pretending to examine certain products, occasionally slipping into Mandarin to discuss the pricing of whatever they were holding.  That, and they made sure to speak in Cantonese.  Although Hurstville is home to quite a large Chinese community, most of them spoke Mandarin, not Cantonese.  There was just one flaw though: despite most of the Chinese community in Hurstville speaking Mandarin, there was still a sizeable Cantonese-speaking population.  And as I'd mentioned above, *I* spoke Cantonese as well.  \n\n\nDeciding against the tetra paks, I grabbed the yellow, vaguely dumbbell-shaped bottle of lemon-flavored heaven, then went up to the women, mustered my best HKer accent, and addressed them in Cantonese. \n\n\n\"Excuse me ma'am, do you know where the cup noodles are?  I'm not too familiar with the store's layout.\" \n\n\nTheir conversation ground to a screeching halt.  They looked at me with something vaguely akin to disbelief, then back at each other.  Finally, after a few moments worth of shocked silence where they tried to figure out what the hell just happened while I savoured every single second, one of them regained her bearings.  \n\n\n\"No, sorry, I don't.\"  \n\n\n\"Oh!  I'm *really* sorry for interrupting your conversation, I'll just get the cup noodles later!  Thank you for your help!\"  \n\n\nAnd with that, I dashed off to the checkout, paid for my drink, and gtfo'd.  \n\n\nI never did get my cup noodles though. :(\n\n**TL;DR:** Two ladies in an Asian Grocery Store™ shittalk other customers in Cantonese, thinking that they wouldn't understand (nevermind the fact that there's quite a few people in Hurstville who speak Cantonese).  I embarrass them by asking them for help - in Cantonese.",

Make them happy and they wont leave right? Well in the immortal words of MF DOOM, \"be too nice some people take you for a dummy.\"\n\nI fell in with a group of friends and one guy in particular Max, was not my friend.\n\nI had a car on campus and hed just use me for rides and not pay gas money (back when gas was 5 bucks a gallon). Max didnt have his car on campus, which is important for later in the story...\n\nHed smoke my weed and never throw in. Drink alcohol and never pay up. His parents were loaded, I was middle class so every time this happened it would hurt my wallet. Max would just phone Dad for more cash then blow it on coke and get his nipples pierced to impress women (didnt work). \n\nThroughout the year Max kept being a dick to me and as I had no real self respect I just ate it. One day though another friend in the group told me Max said to him \"Yeah whenever AndroWanda drives me places I just back out and dont pay him gas money. I smoke his shit and he doesnt do shit hes a pussy etc.\"\n\nI chose morning classes because I'm a morning person and liked to sleep in when I was done. Over the course of a few days Max had been complaining about itching and burning on his side/ribcage. One morning after class Im sleeping and I get a phone call. It was Max, and he sounded terrible.\n\nMax: \"Hey man...can you take me to Urgent Care I think I have shingles man, I'm in pain.\"\n\nRemembering what my friend told me about what Max said about *me*, I replied:\n\n\"Sorry man no can do.\"\n\nMax: \"Please man I'm fuckin in agony, *please* take me. I'll give you gas money I sw-\n\n\"Nah man I'm good.\"\n\n I hung up and went back to sleep. No idea why he didnt go to the health clinic on campus, dont really care.\n\nLater that year I heard he got fucked up by a lacrosse team member for trashing our common room (my half of the floor shared the other half with some of the lacrosse team), and during a Halloween party Max got knocked out for talking shit. Fuck you Max.\n\nP.S.\n\nI was the one who stole your iPod. Eat shit.",

When I got back, I had her test on my desk, and she had mine. I looked over at her and was really mad, and she shrugged and handed me a note which read something along the lines of *”I really need this, my grade is failing in this class and my mom has already taken away my iPod and given me too many punishments”* (not exactly what was said, but it was along these lines) \n\nI looked over at her and asked for my test back one more time, but this time in a really loud whisper. The teacher noticed we were talking during a test and asked me if I was cheating, because I had her test on my desk. \n\nShe also saw the note I had placed under my test, and she had a policy about notes being passed in class, that they had to be read out loud by the recipient. With a smug smile, I walked up to the front of the room and read the note. \n\nShe got so embarrassed and the boys in our class made fun of her, because usually she would hurt and embarrass the rest of us, but the tables had turned. Sweet, sweet revenge. \n\n**EDIT: FOR ANYONE SAYING SHE DIDNT DESERVE THIS, I AM NOT SAYING SHE DID, BUT SHE WAS NOT A NICE PERSON.

The problem with Tim was although he loved to orchestrate pranks on other people, if you played a prank on him, he would not take it like an adult.  \n\nOne time he bought a living room set and left it on a friend’s lawn.  My buddy had to find someone with a truck and haul into the dump and get rid of it.   A lot of his pranks either involved an expense to the victim or a major inconvenience.\n\nOne day, he signed up my primary email account and phone number with everything he could find.   I started getting spam and phone calls constantly.   I had to either block or unsubscribe to a lot of things. It ended up taking months to clear up.   He put confetti in my air vents in my new car.\n\nSo, one day I took out some ads online and in the paper advertising his house for sale.   I added that the seller was leaving the country very soon and needed to sell quickly and listed it at $20,000 below the market price.  His phone basically exploded for the next two weeks.  Constant calls and his voice mail was full regardless of what he did to clean it.  He was getting 100+ emails a day as well.\n\nHe was furious.   Why would anybody do that to him???  After this be agreed that all of the pranks would stop.  True to his word they have but he still plays the victim card about how I took it too far......\n\nIf you’re going to play games, don’t cry if the other team hits a homer.",

        "text": "This is back around 2000.  \n\nAfter the Telecommunications Act of 1996 a new business offshoot in the phone and internet business sprung up.  The big companies like Verizon and Ameritel etc who owned all the physical lines running into buildings were forced to rent those out to companies who could sell the local leg of phone or internet lines.  So companies called CLEC's appeared all over.  \n\nI worked for one of these, processing requests for our Boston region.  Then Verizon technicians went on strike in 2000 and basically my work froze.  Every customer order I processed required me to work with Verizon to implement the circuit up to the POP in whatever building, so my days consisted of coming in and browsing the internet.  Now these CLECs had dogshit margins to begin with and when this strike hit, behind the scenes it was crushing these companies.  Over the span of 3-4 months our company's owner made numerous internal presentations and speeches about how great things were going and how well the company was doing and how the build out of our new headquarters would be great with foosball in the breakrooms and candy cane and gum drops and oompa loompa's delivering our coffee (you get the picture).\n\nCome September of that year we walk into work one day and the company is chapter 7.....not chapter 11.....no, chapter 7 as in doors close immediately, company is liquidating every asset they own, you don't come into work tomorrow.  Many people were furious at having been lied to, the last rah rah speech having come like a week before.  A company doesn't just wind up going chapter 7 by surprise, they knowingly hid this from employees til the bitter end.\n\nSo here we are, the company done, the customers left hanging either waiting on delivery of service or with service stopping abruptly, probably all looking up their customer support numbers.  Now the thing about a telco is that they employ network translations folks.  One of these engineers was so pissed off about being lied to that she reprogrammed all the corporate contact numbers to route to the owners home phone number.  So every support call, vendor service call, debt collector, or prospective customer's phone call would land on that jack ass's home phone number with no one left to fix it.  All throughout happy hour that day we would drunkenly call our support number just to leave messages to the owner on his home answering machine.",

The managers were dickish and the whole vibe in the place was kind of depressing. It was basically a maze of cubicles occupied by unhappy people.\n\nAnyhoo, the salary was decent and I was on track to make a good bonus on my second paycheck so I was giving it a chance. That is until I was informed that I wouldn't be receiving my bonus because I had logged on one minute late 3 times during the pay period. 1 f***king minute. Which means that it was actually less than a minute. Feeling this was unfair I immediately resigned.\n\nWhen the day came to pick up my final paycheck I made a pit stop at a Chinese grocer. I looked for the most offensive smelling food item I could find. This turned out to be a bag of 4 huge fishheads (I think they use them for soup). They still had the eyes and everything, and boy oh boy did they smell terrible. \n\nAfter picking up my paycheck from HR I sneaked into the staff lunch room. It wasn't really a room per sey but just a really big cubicle in the center of the office. There were a couple of microwaves, some tables, etc...and because of the open ceiling the managers were always complaining when anyone brought pungent food. I quickly dumped the heads in one of the microwaves, set it on high for an hour and got the f*** out of dodge. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later I started getting texts from former co-workers, managers, HR, etc. Apparently it had created such a revolting stench that they had to clear the entire floor and give everyone a paid half-day off. I didn't bother replying. I'd made my point. \n\nI don't include that job on my resume ☺",

        "text": "First time posting here. Long post. \n\nA while back, me and my class went on a week-long field trip to London. I began to feel unwell in the morning before we set off and figured that I could shake whatever I had off by day two, so decided to go anyway. I proceeded to have full blown flu and was in agony the entire week. Nevertheless, I still did all the activities, and dragged my lifeless body through the streets of London in February. The week finally comes to an end, and we must take a bus home, this is where I suffered the most.\n\nI try to sit close to my friends, but far away enough to be able to sleep, and they all knew that I'm not feeling too great, so they left me be. However, one of the group members thought it would be funny to harass me the entire way back. London is a long way from home, and we were easily 7 hours away from where we want to be. \nI shit you not, this guy kept on tapping my shoulder, shouting in the seat behind me, and mocking that I am not responding to him for the entirety of the journey. Until that is, I turn around and call him an F'ing C word and tell him to jog on. \n\nHe dialled back for a bit, but then continues as he did before, I chose to ignore him. I was pretty much in despair at this point in time. \n\n\n\nFast forward 4 months, and this guy was partying as hard as he was in freshers week. He was going out every night on the piss. He was able to party this hard because some of our mutual friends were supplying him lecture notes, and were themselves, at the end of their patience with him.\n\nThey decided not to tell him about an assignment they had to do, as they were also letting him know  when things were due by. They informed me about this and shared their plan. \n\nThey were hoping that he would be completely unaware of the assignment and party all through its due date and tell him afterwards. I thought this was funny, but suggested they told him about 7 hours before it was due instead. They thought this was brilliant and even let me be the whistle-blower. \n\nIn my opinion, it was the perfect revenge. He theoretically had enough time to hand something in but had a shitload of unpleasantness ahead of him and hours of stress. His night out would get ruined, I would get a kick, and maybe he would become a better person. \n\nit soon becomes the day before the deadline. The guy is planning to go out that night and starts drinking early. He still didn't know about the assignment. \n\nI casually drop into the group chat that evening asking how people found that assignment. \n\nHe pops up after a minute: ''is this for INSERTSUBJECT?''\n\nI reply: ''yeh for INSERTSUBJECT, how did it go?''\n\nWe all get the response: ''FUCK FUCK FUCK!''\n\nHe then starts cussing about how he should have been informed about this deadline by the guys who normally let him know and then has a go at them. They let him know that it’s his job to do his assignments and that he has access to all the resources and handbooks we have. He then becomes furious with them but these guys are clearly finding this hilarious. Lets just say they weren't friends for a while. \n\nThe whole night he spent updating us on his clusterfuck of a situation rather than dedicating his full attention to his fast approaching deadline. Impressively, he finishes the assignment just in time, but exhausted and suffering a hangover mixed with exhaustion. \n\nThe damage was done though. He got 40% in the essay and barely recovered from that point on academically speaking. He hasn't told anyone what he got in his final assignment. \n\nGraduation will be fun. \n",

Coffee was decent and bread/toast was handy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walked into the kitchen after a busy morning and realized that the last piece of bread was taken, toasted, and abandoned, just sitting there cold in the toaster. Bummer. Then I go to pour some coffee, empty, and of course the person who dusted it did not start a new batch. Damn it! But what is this? A cold cup of coffee, also abandoned, sitting next to the toaster...hmm. I take the toast and shove it into the coffee mug and quickly leave. 3 minutes later one of the managers storms out of the kitchen holding up her ruined snack and coffee above her head and bellows out with an upset smirk: \"WHO did this!?\" I duck below my screen and bite my lip. She pans the office floor as my internal laughter is causing my chair to vibrate, though far enough away to avoid detection. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was buying a second hand monitor online and was bidding at multiple screens. 1 seller immediatly responded by telling me to go kill myself and he called me a 'cheap cancerdog' (yeah its a thing in NL). \n\nI wasnt going to let this happen. Two days or so later I made a second account and bid (this time close to retail price) on his ad and send a message that I was interested in his monitor. After some simple negotiaton I gained his trust and we made a deal.\n\nI talked in a way that would make him believe I was an innocent guy bidding too much. When I asked him where and when, I also asked him if he would meet me at the trainstation because I had an injury and couldnt walk that well. \n\nWhen the day came, he was waiting and waiting and finally sent me a message 'dude where are you?'  (of course I just stayed home!). \n\nI made up some shit that my train was delayed and promised him €10 for his troubles. We kept messaging and when he told me he was totally wet and waiting in the cold I couldn't stop laughing and felt my revenge unravel. \n\nI wanted him to become his true self so after a total waiting time of approximately 1.5 hours I asked him to come to my town instead and he started the most toxic rage ever. After his tirade I simple said 'who's the cancerdog now?'. \n\nHe never responded.\n\nEdit: Second hand means a used product and NL stand for The Netherlands \n         ",

They aren't here anymore so it makes perfect sense for them to hate the young new couple who just moved into the neighborhood. \n\nWe have been here for 9 months now and they are just the biggest dicks on Earth. \nThey are always bitching at me or being loud for no reason. etc You know, typical Neighbors from Hell situation. Such as complaining I having a flower hanging off onto their property line or some other small shit.\n\nWell I am also an asshole and 4 months ago I decided it was time to be the big dick in the neighborhood. I've been wanting a new car around that time and after saving up for my down payment etc I had it delivered to my house. I knew this would upset my neighbors that's why I had it delivered instead of going to a dealer. \n\nSo this big ass truck pulls in our neighborhood being as loud as it can be because it's a big rig pulling an enclosed trailer with cars in it. Here come my neighbors. Right on cue. They are all standing outside wondering wtf the noise is and shit and here I come. I walk outside in loafers wearing my boxers and smoking a stogie. Standing proud as my neighbors worst nightmare is about to roll off the trailer.\n\nI strut my ass on over and sign the papers accepting delivery of my neighbors new alarm clock. I hop in and check out my new toy and I rev it a few times to let the neighbors know that when I wake up from now on, that's when you will wake up. Of course, this wouldn't be complete without me tearing ass down the street to take my car for nice test drive. So I give them a show and can see they are furious.\n\nWhich is what I want because they started this shit. In fact, this is only the beginning. My wife is having an in ground pool installed in about 8 months once we have the funds so I will make sure that the guys who install it are super loud.\n",

        "text": "I work in a business that is basically code enforcement. I collect documentation from our field agents, review it, and move it up the chain. During the review portion, if anything is missing, I reach out the the field agent for them to correct it, this is usually done via email, as it's the fastest way to deliver paperwork. 99% of the time this goes very smoothly. Except for Ben. Ben hates \"taking orders\" from a \"little girl\" (his words). \n\nA few weeks ago, I was reviewing my orders and noticed Ben did not submit one of the required forms. I send him a quick email: Good morning Ben, I received your forms for order #123456, I noticed Form X is missing, could you please send it over asap? Manager is looking to get this completed. Thanks.\n\nThis was around 8:30am, so I didn't expect and immediate response. I carry on with my work. Around 3pm I realize I haven't heard back from Ben, so I call his cell. Two rings and then voicemail. I left a message: Hi Ben, just calling to follow up on the email I sent this morning, Manager is still looking for that form, please send it over. Thanks!\n\n5pm and I leave for the day. The next morning, still no word from Ben. Is he ghosting me? That's kind of rude... so I give him another call. 4 rings then voicemail: Hi Ben, I've not heard back yet about Form X on order #123456. Can you please call me? Thanks\n\nNothing.\n\nMy manager really truly needs this form, so I call another field agent and ask him to redo the whole thing, he agrees, for a price. He wants $75 to get it done within the hour, my manager agrees and we get everything taken care of.\n\nNow, our office policy, which is made very clear to everyone, is that if someone has to clean up your work and fix your mistakes, their fee comes out of your pocket. So when I process payment for agent #2, I advise our billing department it should be taken from Ben's paycheck. \n\nTwo more days pass and I finally get an email back from Ben. All it says is \"what's the job number\". Well, first off, the job number is clearly listed in the email you just responded to, and second, this was taken care of days ago. \n\nBen's attitude has always irked me, so I leave his email in my inbox for a few days. The weekend comes and goes, and i finally decide Monday, just before closing, that i will respond with just the order number. Hit send at 4:58 and i walk out the door. Tuesday, around noon, I get an email from Ben with the form attached. Too late, buddy. \n\nI wait until lunch time on Wednesday and email Ben: Hello Ben, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but we had this order corrected last week. The $75 deduction has been applied to your account. Thanks so much for getting back to me so quickly! Have a great one!",

My class was loud and the teacher was focused on something else, so I secretly went to his chrome book and found out he stayed signed in, so I decided I wanted some revenge. So I searched up a porn site and clicked on a video. I forget the exact details but I rigged it and turned up the volume to the max so when he would open up the chrome book, the video would play and everyone would hear it. I closed the chrome book and waited for him at my seat. When he came back, he opened up the chrome book and the porn played. Everyone in the class heard it and found out the sounds were coming from his computer. The look of fear and embarrassment from his face was hilarious, and his face turned to a really bright red, and everybody started laughing. The teacher immediately went over to his desk and sent him to the office, and he got suspended.\n\nI never got caught but I have mixed feelings about the whole incident. He deserved it for being a piece of shit to not only my friend, but other kids who did nothing wrong towards him and him never getting in trouble because he threatened to hurt the kids more if they ever snitched. But at the same time, I feel bad for doing that because I think I messed him up or something because he never really talked anymore, his grades fell, and he ended up moving schools all of a sudden. I don’t know if what I did was right or wrong, but at least it was the one of the funniest things to happen that year.",

For about two days, I was able to take small bits to school. \n\nD: \"Why do you eat so much watermelon?\"\n\nMe, rather quietly: \"because it's delicious...\"\n\nD: \"That's so weird, watermelon-head!\"\n\nCommence a full week of being bullied over a damn piece of fruit. Looking back I shouldn't have been so upset but mini-me back then was so shy and self-conscious that it mattered. At one point, I had had enough and went to a teacher for help, only to be laughed at. I couldn't understand why nobody would help me, so I asked my mum. Short and sweetly, she said that I had to stand up for myself. \n\nStand up for myself? Little old me? Sure. \n\nIt was a clear, sunny day for revenge. At lunchtime, my eyes were set on the money bars. D had been hanging on them for the entire spell, distracted his own world. Perfect. While he had his back turned to me, still hanging in the air, I grabbed both his shorts and his underwear and pantsed him infront of the entire school. \n\nMum had apparently gotten called into the principal's office over my actions. Her response?\n\n\"Good for her.\"\n\nAnd I never got bullied by D again after that. \n\n\n",

        "text": "This happened last night. I am a chef at a busy restaurant and last night was no exception. About an hour into our shift, we start running out of plates. I yell over to the dish guys “Hey, can you bring us some plates back here?” As, it’s their job to bring plates to the line. \n\nThey looked at each other, then went back to scrubbing the dish room. So after 15 minutes, I called over again “Hey, we really need plates on the line!” To which the dish guy says “Yeah, you can come get them man, (the manager) said we have to have this area cleaned before we can home so we need to finish this.” They share a laugh and continue cleaning the dish room. \n\nThis infuriated me as we weren’t closing for another 5 hours and my orders were piling up. Fine. I’ll get this damn plates myself. As I’m walking to to dish room, I grabbed a cart so I can load up. I see the dish guys watching me but still not stopping. \n\nI huffed back to my station to even more tickets piling up. That’s it. I had enough. I moved the cart into a large alcove near my station and begin to pile on the dirty dishes.\n\nFor the rest of the night, every single dirty plate, utensil, grill weight, pan,  skillet, everything. On the cart. I occasionally check in with the dish guys (as I’m getting more plates since they still won’t bring them) and they are making remarkable progress and are so invested in getting out of work on time that they didn’t realize, they haven’t had to do too many dishes, only the ones the servers have been bringing them. \n\nSo, last call comes around (we close at 11 p.m.) and I see them start to grab some pans and other miscellaneous items I left on the counter (I couldn’t fit anymore on the second cart I managed to grab) and quickly put them through the dishwasher. I see them load up the last of the plates the servers bring and the coffee urns. This whole time I’m quickly finishing my own tasks and I’m almost done. I wait until I see them start draining the sinks.\n\nThis is it.\n\nI hear the one dish guy say “Go get (manager) so we can get checked out and get outta here!”\n\nAs the guy walks away, I wrestled this monster of a cart out of my alcove and begin to drag it into the dish room. I see they dish guys eyes widen. “Whoa man! What is this? Seriously? What the fuck is this?” He says as I park it in the center of the room. \n\nI respond “It’s a cart full of dirty dishes.” “Man, we just finished our job! We can’t do this. We already cleaned everything!” I say “Oh. Well, were do you want me to put the other one then?” I see him die inside. “Maaan. Why the fuck didn’t you bring this to us when we were open? Why the fuck do you wait until now?” I responded “Well, the managers said I need to finish my orders, so I didn’t have time to. You could have come and gotten it though, you know, because it’s you damn job.” \n\nThe manager and the other dish washer return and I can see the smile fade right off his face. He looks at the cart, then the other dish guy with disbelief. My manager says “I thought you said you were done. Doesn’t look like it to me.” \n\nThe first guy say “He waited until now to bring this to us. We already cleaned. He literally just brought us this now. He can’t do that.”\n\nMy manager looked at me and I said “They could have come and gotten it at any point. I was too busy and they weren’t clearing the dirty dishes off the line even after I asked them. I forgot about it until now.” \n\nMy manager then looks at them and says “Well, it’s too late now. Sorry guys. Open it back up. We can’t leave this here.”\n\nI could almost feel the heat radiating off of them. \n\nI turn and got the other cart. The other dish guy see it then started slamming pans around. \n\nI got my check out, and as I was walking to the POS to clock out, the dish guy said “This is seriously fucked up man. I’ll fucking remember this shit.”  So I said back “Good. I hope you also remember it’s your job to bring me my fucking plates next time.” \n\n...\n\n\nFound out today they didn’t get out of there until 3 a.m.\n\nTL;DR Dish washers were to concerned with getting out on time to bring me plates (their job) during a rush. Piled every dirty dish I could find on two carts and left it until closing time. Surprised them with it just as they finished cleaning the dish room and were about to head home. ",

        "text": "More bus driving tales from a bus driver guy. \n\nI'm driving along (big surprise), approaching a left turn. Now, there's a stop a little ways back from the instersection *just* for me, and another one right at the light for the buses that go straight through. \n\nI pass my stop, then along comes a young woman who asks me to stop at the light. No can do, I'm not making a left turn from the right turn lane for your ass.\n\nNow, she needs to keep going straight, and I *try* to tell her that I loop around and come back to *the very same street* so she doesn't have to walk all the way back from my next stop after I turn, which is a good 8-9 minute walk. But she doesn't want to hear it. First she asks me to just pull over. \n\nNow one thing you need to understand, if I stop anywhere other than my stops and something happens, slip, trip, fall, collision, *whatever*, that's on me. Sorry, but I'm not risking my job for you. \n\nNow she starts getting angry. Every time I try to talk it's just \"shut up, I don't want to hear it, shut your mouth\" blah blah blah. I'm getting to the next stop, and she's still going. Now I'm starting to get pissed. I wouldn't talk to a dog the way she's talking to me. \n\nSo I'm pulling over, she's mouthing off, and I think \"fuck this\" and pull away from the stop and keep going. Next stop is a good 15 minute walk back. \n\nShe goes \"what the hell?!\", and all I say is \"you didn't ring the bell\" (which was technically true but come on).\n\nShe goes *ballistic*. \"YOU MOTHERFUCKER FUCK YOU YOU PIECE OF SHIT\" etc., and she starts pulling and tugging on my barrier like she's trying to rip it off the hinges. Telling me she's gonna do this that and the other to me. \n\nNot the nicest move on my part, but, *again* if she would have stopped screaming at me for two god damn seconds *I could have fucking told her I'd get her back to the fucking street she needed, closer to her destination*.\n\nI pull over at the next stop, call the emergency line, open all my doors. She's screaming her head off while I'm on the line, they can hear the whole thing. They hop on the intercom and tell her to get off or the police will be dispatched, she screams \"I'LL WAIT FOR THE FUCKING POLICE I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!\"\n\nI relay that to the emergency line, they send the police. Now she's standing there trying to get a rise out of me, calling me every name in the book. I just keep my eyes forward and ignore her. \n\nPolice show up, she starts up with them \"THIS PIECE OF SHIT BUS DRIVER\", they cut her off, tell her to leave the bus to talk outside. One officer goes with her, one stays with me to take my statement. \n\nI explain the whole thing, then both officers go talk to her for a while. \n\nThey all come back to the bus, and now her demeanor had *drastically* changed.\n\nShe says to the officers \"umm, I have a question about\" and I can't hear the rest, but she's basically acting like a scared puppy. \n\nThey just tell her \"the instructions are on the back, and you'll have to walk down to [street she wanted].\"\n\nShe leaves, and one of the officers says to me \"she was being a real cunt.\" I had a hard time not laughing my ass off. He continues, \"your by-laws have some teeth to them, I wrote her about $500 worth of tickets for impeding the flow or transit and a few other things. Anyway, we're done, you can just wait for your supervisor.\"\n\nI thank them and do just that, revelling in the knowledge that today justice was swift, and ruthless. \n\ntl;dr: don't interrupt people who are trying to help you. \n\ntl;dr part 2 electric boogaloo: One woman, pushed to the edge by a callous and cruel yet incredibly handsome and well-endowed man with many close friends and an active social life and no psychological issues whatsoever he's just tired, puts it all on the line, and pays... *the ultimate price*. \"Shut Up You Stupid Bus Driver I Don't Want To Hear It\".

My father didn’t really like her personally and he certainly didn’t like getting calls from her at night after working a very mentally taxing job for 10 hours. \n\nWell one night she had called and left a message. He had been out drinking, and my mom (bless that woman as she put/puts up with a lot) dutifully took down the note and left it for him. He returned home pretty drunk about 1:30 AM (on a week night). He found the message called this woman (who answered after many, many rings) and said “Nancy, this is Father, I just got home and saw your message and I knew it had to be important so I wanted to call you back right away.”  \n\nWhatever it was she said it could wait and she never called him again.

        "text": "So, a little bit of context. I work at a job of 75+ people where we digitize paper files from companies. Many of these files have confidential info, so my place of work has some extra aspects of security e.g no camera-capable devices, lockers to leave phones in and, most relevantly, an inner and outer door with camera buzzers (think Seinfeld's apartment buzzer system with a low rez camera that turn on after you ring the bell). \n\nIn the room I work, 6-8 people work on scanners and computers. The intercom for those doors happens to be in this room. Now, 58% of the time my boss is the closest to the buzzer and he lets people in (people coming back from lunch or break or going out to smoke). The rest of the time, when my boss is elsewhere in the building, the rest of us grunts share the task of answering the door when it rings. Here is where the problems happen. \n\nWith the layout of the room, none of us are as close to intercom as my boss when he's at his desk, so it takes any one of us a teensy bit longer to get to intercom when it goes off. Now, for most people that work at my job, there are some unspoken rules of etiquette with ringing the door bell. \n1. You ring once and you don't ring again until the light that indicates the camera is on goes off (which means no one heard the bell or saw you on the screen this takes about 15 seconds)\n 2. Don't ring the bell for the inner door it takes a sec to switch the buzzer to the second door and if you do it inexplicably rings 4 times. Like seriously, we know there's two doors, we've walked through then too, did you think we'd just walk away and then when you ring the bell for the second bell we go back?\n3. That's really it, doors aren't that complicated.\n\nWhen these rules are broken, then comes the vicious retribution. Different people will inflict different punishments like berating them through intercom for being an impatient dick, or letting them wait for a while. However mine is a little more petty.  The cameras are the best part of the whole system. When someone rings too quickly I buzz the door and right when they reach for the handle I let go. Simple. Effective. \n\nNow depending on how egregious your offense I might just immediately buzz you in after the first time as a warning. If you wait two seconds between rings you better believe I'm gonna buzz you, then stop as you reach, wait for you to reach for the bell again only to buzz you in the second you take your hand off the doorknob and the release it when you try to quickly grab it again. Someone once just kept ringing the bell with literally no waiting in between and she just wasn't going to stop until the door opened (like is that what you do at people's houses you monster?). I faked her three times until she learned to keep her hand on the knob, but even then I did a split second buzz that didn't even last long enough to release the lock but did make her pull on the door in vain. I finally gave her a nice long, almost mocking buzz (it's possible) and she opened the outer door. Then when she went for the inner door, and her defenses were down I let her ring the inner bell, four rings be damned, and faked her out again. God, she was fuming, and cursing up a storm. Another mocking buzz and she's in the building. She immediately walked by where the intercom is even though it's not on the way to her desk. Luckily I had already gone back to my seat and she just kept trying to make eye contact with everyone and anyone near the intercom so she could confront someone. I just tried to look at my computer without laughing.\n\ntl;dr I used the door buzzer system to fake people out and pull on a locked door as punishment for ringing the bell too often.\n",

        "text": "Not too long ago I was with a group of friends hiking some local trails. These particular trails are unique in this area because they contain a few waterfalls. Waterfalls are quite a rarity in this part of the country, so naturally they are a huge draw for all ages. The trail approaches the waterfall from the top, so you make the descent down the left side wooden steps to get to the bottom. This being the largest one, there was a pretty large group of kids and parents gathered underneath it and around the pool it creates. Our group stopped for a bit as well, taking in the waterfall. As my girlfriend and I are sitting on the adjacent bank we notice a boy, probably around 7, picking on a much younger, smaller kid. The one being bullied was trying to lean down and pick up his shoes and socks, which were sitting right by the edge of a 5-6 foot drop off, above the pool. So the shit head kid gives the little dude a pretty good shove backwards and in the same motion kicks his shoes and socks off the tiny ledge, down into the water. The bully runs off laughing and little man starts crying and takes off to go notify his mom. Kid points out to mom who the shit head was and mom takes note and tells him to go retrieve his stuff from the water. Bully kid at this point is over by his socks and shoes, sitting down to put them on. Then he suddenly gets back up and jumps back in pool. Mom, without making any scene or sudden movements casually walks by the area where the bully's crap was, and like a silent assassin, kicks the little shit head's socks and shoes right down off that same ledge. Quickly turns right around, gathers up her son, and walks right back up those steps for the clean escape. My girlfriend and I just sat there smiling and watching as the bully came back to get his stuff and found them floating down below. He looked around maniacally presumably to find little man, but to no avail. Beautiful.",

Mostly just typing documents and letters.\n\nMost were as you'd expect, do your best.\n\nThen she was given a maternity leave placement. Normally this would be a good gig, spend 6 months on an established team etc. But it was horrific, due to the office manager. \n\nHe was superficially nice, but delegated so that he got to do the work from the top end managers. If a piece of work came in from a higher up, and it was automatically dropped into a normal workers taskbox, he would find any sort of infringement that he could, trigger a disciplinary, and reallocate all their work so he could cherrypick the job, then complete a performance review to justify demoting or firing them.\n\nThe main problem was that the central part of the job was accurately typing documents, and transcribing conversations.\n\nThe Office Manager was not a great speller. Every document was reviewed and he relied on Spellcheck to keep him right.\n\nMy friend created a document with every misspelling she could think of. And added them all to his dictionary.\n",

During snow plowing, he would move his car to our side of the street, close enough to my driveway that the snowplow would have to swerve wide, leaving not only a huge path of un-plowed street, but also all the street's snow added to what's already there. After plowing, he would move his car back in front of his house, where (of course) the plows had done a great job.  \n\nTried asking a couple of times for him not to do that, but he kept it up. So next snowfall, same deal. Nice and wet snow, followed by nights of deep cold.  So, I made it a point to use the snowblower to bury his car in the wet snow, right after the plows went by.  Every flake from a 25' x 75' double-depth area went on his car. Like up to the door handles, with a generous dollop on top. Then it got down to about 5F that night.  So next morning, his car was an iceberg.  Took him quite a while to chip out. He had learned his lesson.\n\nWhat made it worse was that he was a long-term free guest at the house he lived in. He didn't even pay taxes to support the city services he was preventing me from receiving.  Overall, petty but satisfying.",

We all call him Pete, and he's a pretty okay guy.\n\n\nNow, when you've gone through years of education, with teachers mispronouncing your name \"Kristian\" during attendance for the female counterpart \"Kristina\" just because they fail to read names correctly, you start getting used to it for a while. Naturally all the kids will laugh at the mistake and you're embarrassed for a good 10 seconds (okay 10 minutes) and you move on with your life. Maybe throughout all those years I've acquired a bit of respect when it comes to remembering and putting emphasis on people's names. We can all agree that it's an important part of your identity.\n\n\nSo just this morning, Pete messages me through one of my companies' channels \"Morning Kristian,\" to which I respond \"Hi Pete,\" and we get to the topic of having each others' phone numbers in case of emergency. I send him my number, and tell him to shoot me a text. I get \"Hey Christian, this is Pete.\" Of course I'm triggered because HE JUST SPELLED MY NAME CORRECTLY LIKE 2 MINUTES AGO. Being as petty as I can, after years of accumulated rage, I giddily respond \"Got it, thanks Peet.\" It felt wonderful - he just responds \"ok.\" I can only imagine what was going through his head, if he thought \"How could he possibly misspell my name?\" I don't care if it was a mistaken auto-correct or not, put some RESPECT on my name. We'll have to wait and see if he ever tries to pull that stunt on me again. In retrospect, I probably should've called him Beerabong. ",

They had a roommate agreement that said what everyone needs to do but no one would. One roommate would say to everyone \"you need to do your job\" but they wouldn't do anything either so in the end my GF would end up doing everything, after which that one roommate who told everyone to do their job would end up taking credit. She would tell everyone that she actually did clean up but they would say \"we don't care as long as it gets done\". \n\nWell she moved out about a month ago and the place had gone to hell and the roommate who always took credit is now under fire because they aren't cleaning like they used to.",

One set was freshly paved while the other set was cracked up and needed repair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm to teach class to middle schoolers and arrive 10 minutes before the scheduled class on the nice courts. There are two middle-aged men playing and I tell them that I need both courts and that they belong to the park district. They refuse saying that they got there first. We get into an argument but the kids have all arrived and I'm like fine, whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we hop on the court and I set up a drill have to hit a sharp angled cross-court shot within the deuce side service box into the opposing deuce side service box. Basically, every ball that was hit rolled over into the other court that these men wouldn't leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen they come over to me yelling that I'm intentionally doing that. I just said it's all part of the lesson and they're kids and can't control their aim that well. I agree that I'll start a new drill that is down the line, secretly with the intention to occasionally hit one into their court every now and then. However, my part here was done as the middle-schoolers caught on to what was happening.  The kids started hitting all of their balls into their court on purpose. They would even pick up balls on the ground just to hit them over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow these guys are furious and start yelling at me even more and I'm just like, there are two courts on the other side of the park. They got left and made the long walk over. I've never bonded so closely with my students, it was hilarious.\n\n\nEdit: To be clear, yes I worked for the park district and these were park district classes that were clearly posted on the fences and online",

        "text": "All to many years ago I took a class at my University entitled \"Traffic Safety.\" Yes, I know, you are right, but I was a safety minor on top of two majors, so...should be an easy 2 credit A; it was.\n\nWhile the class had around 25 students, 15 of them were football players, imagine that.\n\nThe professor gave weekly tests; she was the master of the petty revenge enacted, I was but an observer, and potentially, a pawn.\n\nFirst test is distributed, it is twenty multiple choice questions.  And if you sat upright and stayed awake in class and did the 20 pages of reading, was as easy as could be.  I breeze through in about 10 minutes, but I cannot help but notice I am surrounded by the most obvious rubber necking cheaters I could possibly imagine.  Most of them had the obligatory football t-shirts and sweatshirts on.  Not the kind you would buy, but the kind you were comped as a player on the team.  As I completed my test I wondered how the professor did not notice...  And as it turns out I was the epicenter of the rubber necking that had a domino affect to all similarly attired students.  It probably isn't fair to say \"all,\" but you have my point. A lot of A grades were given for this test.\n\nNext week, weekly test.  The following class time the papers are returned, about 13 high grades and 12 F's. How do I know?  Because there was an uproar when the F's were distributed and the football players started whispering, then got louder, about how they got an F grade when they knew they had the same answers as those that sat next to.  The teacher suggested better class notes and to do the reading.\n\nNext week, weekly test.  When the results came back, they were less high grades and more F's.  The class is about to go \"off!\"  The professor continues the diatribe of pay attention in class, study your notes; do the reading and you will do well.  When pressed, the professor shares: \"It was not so long ago that I was in University classes and I prepared for every test so I could learn the material and do well.  I noticed as a student that there were some in the class that don't put the same amount of effort in and it is a life skill that is being missed.  Short cuts in life seldom turn out well, so do the work.\"\n\nThen, the professor shared that the 2nd test was actually 2 tests.  Same questions, in different sequences.  \n\nThe 3rd test was actually 3 different tests, same questions in a different sequence.\n\nThe professor never accused anyone of cheating...\n\nNext week, weekly test, 1/2 of the tests are on yellow paper and 1/2 the tests are on green paper.  Results come back and as far as I could tell, nobody had any complaints.  The professor shared that all tests were the same, just printed on different colored paper.  By this time the players weren't playing and they actually spent :30 studying and did well.\n\nShe was awesome!\n\nTL:DR Professor exacts a petty revenge to teach a life lesson in doing the work as opposed to cheating.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

One of the classes I teach is a required 101 course, and on the first day, a freshman girl sauntered in ten minutes late, pushed her way to a seat in the back, and immediately got on her phone. I asked for her name, which she gave without even making eye contact, as she was still on her phone. (I'm not uptight about phones the first day, though they're banned after that.)\n\nA few minutes later, I started going through the assignment requirements. No actual final (I don't believe in them), but there's an eight page paper instead. \n\nAt this, the girl groaned very loudly in disgust and insisted, \"Make it four. I'm not writing eight pages!\"\n\nSomeone clearly didn't know how to adult yet, but I just smiled and said, \"My final paper is eight pages. If you don't want to write that, there's another 101 course next door right now, and that teacher's requirements are different. I'm fairly certain that's the last class with open seats.\"\n\nShe made a face that was the equivalent of the middle finger and left.\n\nI hadn't lied. That WAS the last class with open seats, but only because the instructor is a harpy who can't teach and doesn't care if everyone fails as long as she gets paid. She keeps her job by keeping her lips plastered to the department chair's rear but has the worst rating in the department. \n\nAlso, not only does she have an actual final exam AND a final paper, but her paper is twelve pages. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I was watching over her just in case but she was alright, just a little slow. \n\nThis asshat leans over the counter and yells, “Jesus Christ can I get someone that knows what the fuck they’re doing?” Now this upset my young friend because she was new and nervous and I’m pretty jaded at this point because of being here so long so I was like go sit down for a second I got this dear and turned to him and said, “It’s her second day at her first job, and she’s a kid so please don’t raise your voice. Everyone has a first for everything.” He goes a hootin n a hollerin about how we lost a customer and this and that and we’re disrespectful and he leaves.\n\nFast forward to a few hours ago. My work is at the corner of a super busy redlight in the middle of two major cities. Accidents happen. This guy was doing a u-turn and t-boned a minivan. Both of them are at fault here btw because they both were trying to get through a yellow but anyways. I’m hanging out outside and see it go down and walk over because there’s kids crying and this woman broke her arm. My manager already called 911 so it’s fine. \n\nI was trying to comfort the young kids and keep them distracted from their mother’s fucked up arm while we waited on paramedics. I offered them some ice cream cones. The mom was like yes that’s fine. I bring them the cones and they sit down on the grass and we talk about their schools and stuff. Super chill. Everyone gets taken care of etc etc. \n\nWhile the police are getting everything reported and documented, mean guy comes in. “I’m so sorry I left my wallet in my truck out there and you see they won’t let me in it” basically asking for a few sandwiches and drinks for free. I looked him dead in the eye and said, “Sir I can’t give out food for free just because of an automobile accident.” He looks at me, looks outside, looks at me again. Walks out and punches the door on his way. ",

Watched the sheriff's pull up. They go inside, speak to him, then arrest him announcing to the whole waiting room that he was arrested for VOP of molestation (of a different kid). He got extradited to home state where he got a 10-year sentence. \n\nI hope when he gets out his girlfriend keeps the kid away from him.

Can I have a transfer?\"\n\nSatisfied, and having now completed my turn, I happily oblige. \n\nAs he walks away I hear him mutter \"little bitch.\"\n\nOh no, child. \n\nStop the bus, parking brake on, doors open, hazards blinking. \n\n\"Come back here.\"\n\n\"What?\" Not an \"I didn't hear you\" what, a \"what are you gonna do about it\" what. \n\n\"Come back to the front of the bus, and repeat what you said.\"\n\n\"Yo I didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"You're either going to walk back up here so we can discuss this, or this bus doesn't move another inch.\"\n\nThe girls start coaxing him to go, calling him an idiot, etc..

Okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nI could have pushed it, not really a very sincere apology, but what the hell, good enough. \n\nFast forward to the next day. Same stop, same kids running. I don't owe them any favours, so I pick up and drive off. \n\nNext day, same kids, still running (don't they learn?). What the hell, I'm sure he's learned his lesson. I pull up, this time he recognizes me, stops running, and flips me the bird. Suit yourself. I pull away and drive off. Sorry girls, but you should keep better company. \n\nI don't see them again for a couple weeks, then on the last day of the work period, before I move to a different route, there they are, at the stop this time. I guess they *did* learn!\n\nAs he gets on, I can't help myself, I ask \"nothing to say to me this time? Nothing to show me?\"\n\n\"Whadoyou mean?\"\n\n\"You flipped me off last time I saw you.\"\n\n\"Yo, cause you drove right by me!\"\n\n(mocking) \"Yo, because you called me a little bitch!\"\n\nIt ends there, he goes to sit down. \n\nWe get to his stop, he walks past me, not a word. He's wising up. Guess he doesn't know I won't be there tomorrow, doesn't want to push his luck again. \n\nLight turns green, he starts walking, I start driving. He turns around and looks at me, I turn to him, then very deliberately and conspicuously raise my middle finger, and slowly push up my sunglasses, with a big shit-eating grin on my face. \n\nLast I see of him in my mirror, he's pointing at the bus and yelling something at his little friends. \n\nFelt pretty good after that, won't lie. \n\ntl; dr: ur a little bitch, no u, NO U, **DOUBLE NO U**.\n\nalt tl;dr: grown man gets into stupid diaper baby fight with a teenager.",

I said “oh yeah well fuck you again” and I slammed the phone down. \nIt was on! I’d lost it and went over the edge. I couldn’t see his number but I hit *69 and called him back. \nHe answered and I said in a creepy voice” How does it feel to have me call you?” “How does it feel?”   Getting more spooky and insane sounding every time I called. \nHe abruptly hung up and after my second call took his phone off the hook for a half hour.  Then I called again. Then I waited I for about two hours and called again, really creeped this guy out. I always said “How does it feel?” I called him back at least four times.\nSomebody from my family called me and broke the spell and my ability to call back with *69. \n\nWell he never called again and we were just getting to know each other.

        "text": "Happened a few months ago. I was on my way to work with my wife and going east on I-66 towards DC just sucks. People are insane here, don't know how to drive, aren't in a hurry and act like they are distracted tourists admiring the clouds or something. We encountered one of those typical big ass trucks that was going under the speed limit in HOV but then would increase their speed like a mad-man if anyone tried to pass them. Of course, we encountered them as soon as we hit the interstate and we just couldn't get away from them. To make matters worst, they had all of their windows down blaring shitty music. It was so loud that I couldn't have a conversation in the car with my wife. This continued on for a long time, even after we got on 495 and even when we got off 495. \n  \n  \nSo then I noticed that the guy was driving a company car with their number listed. I blocked my number and called.....and the music stopped! The number listed was apparently his cell phone and he was playing music though his cell phone. I waited a few seconds (we are 1 car behind him, in the next lane) until the music blasted again, and I called and just muted myself while dying laughing listening to him scream spanish at me. I'd hang up....wait a few seconds...and call again. This time he didn't talk and I asked for the company name (\"Hi, I'm calling to reach John's Towing company?\" or whatever the name was, this was in April) and then he started talking and I muted again. After he hung up, I called and asked if he was having trouble hearing me and he said \"Yes yes, I believe you have the bad signal!\" and again muted. I finally ended it when we turned off and I told him that no one wants to hear his fucking music, learn to drive. \n  \n  \nIt allowed us to finish the commute with a laugh and less music. Also, fuck you if you play your music loud as hell at 6:00 in the morning with all the windows down, fuck you. ",
