        "text": "Hi Theory Of Reddit,\n\nThis post is a follow-up to my [last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/6bdq36/a_method_for_gaming_the_front_page_using/) about a vote manipulation method via moderator power. \n\nThe trick has been discussed here in this subreddit before:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/69t57v/moderator_of_revilbuildings_discloses_the_tricks/\n\nI intend to better illustrate the method, present some evidence of its use, and maybe come up with an idea to improve reddit. For the time being, please put politics aside. Approach this problem from the standpoint of karma farming.\n\n# The Method\n\nSimply put, the method is:\n\n1. Get your thread hot\n2. Ban any other submission(s) from your subreddit on the front page\n3. Jump on the new thread\n4. After the new thread is established, bring back the old thread(s)\n\nTo illustrate, here are some screenshots I took of the method in action.\n\nPost your thread (note the sticky):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/l1hcaQg.png\n\nGet it hot, here is the formerly stickied thread at #8:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/L7Kyi3v.png\n\nHere it is at #3:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YkhMUhd.png\n\nAnd at #2:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9bWlR1p.png\n\nBan the old thread from the sub. The #2 thread is promoted to #1:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GbO3IaY.png\n\nVotes stop on the old thread as it is no longer visible (ban occured at ~13:00 GMT):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lS9wdll.png\n\nJump on the new thread (notice what happens at ~13:00 GMT):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pWCdYTr.png\n\nAfter a while, bring the old thread back. It will sit behind the new thread at #2:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CsdYlc4.png\n\nThat's how it works.\n\n# The evidence\n\nPlease look at the top posts from these two subreddits.  One is a general interest subreddit, while the other is about a political figure.  As I said, put politics aside.  Pay close attention to who gets the karma in the sub.\n\nEvilBuildings:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/evilbuildings/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all\n\nhttp://archive.is/6lTYL\n\nOutPresident:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all\n\nhttp://archive.is/DAAxk\n\nNow go back and look at the screenshots again, and you'll see what I'm talking about. \n\n# Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, I think the subscribers of those two subreddits should take their moderators to KarmaCourt.\n\nThere is clearly some kind of vote manipulation going on, but this is different than brigades or bots.  Gaming the system should be discouraged, and I believe people should be aware of the problem. That's my motivation for posting.\n\nThe problem seems to turn on the act of a moderator banning a thread from the subreddit. This act fools the front page into thinking the subreddit hasn't had a popular thread lately. The system is being gamed through clever timing when there are no other posts on the front page. Mod power make this possible at will.\n\nA suggestion to improve reddit might be to preserve the information about a thread being on the front page through the ban. \n",

When I went to the front page I noticed something. The front page has a ton of material from anti-Trump subreddits. I thought \"maybe this is just a liberal site, so anti-Trump stuff just always gets voted to the front. That's perfectly fine.\" However, after looking for pro-Trump communities, I found www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald, which has far more subscribers than the anti-Trump subs and usually gets more upvotes per post. Considering this, why don't posts from The_Donald end up on the front page? Are they being censored? I browsed the material on The_Donald, and while it was kind of obnoxious, it wasn't hateful or anything. It was just as annoying as r/esist and MarchAgainstTrump. By the way, I asked my brother and he says he doesn't really know. So that's why I'm here :) And if this is not the right sub to ask this, please direct to the proper sub.

        "text": "Hello Theory Of Reddit,\n\nWe've all heard about social media manipulation on reddit in terms of fake votes, whether you mean purchased from a \"reddit social media marketing\" company, or a brigade organized from off-site using facebook, IRC, or discord.  This post is not about that kind of manipulation.\n\nPresented here is a method by which the moderators of a subreddit insure the thread they want gets popular.  The method can be applied towards karma farming, pushing a narrative, or both.\n\n\n#References\n\nPlease read these three threads regarding two subreddits, r/EvilBuildings and r/MarchAgainstTrump:\n\n\n1. https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/69m9t2/the_accusations_against_umalgoya_the_founder_of/\n\n2. https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/6alu1z/a_realtime_illustration_of_gaming_the_1_hot/\n\n3. https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/6bb1z8/you_should_know_how_moderators_can_abuse_reddits/\n\nThread #1 above is where I learned about it. In response, I made thread #2 from screenshots to illustrate the idea. Thread #3 describes how it works.\n \nAnd at least look at this blog post from last year about how r/The_Donald was always on the front page:\n\n* http://ryancompton.net/2016/08/07/upvotes-over-time-by-subreddit-or-why-the_donald-is-always-on-the-front-page-of-reddit/\n\n#The Method\n\nIn thread #3, /u/ggggnut writes:\n\n&gt; Reddit's latest algorithm limits how many posts a subreddit can have in r/all/hot. The more posts you have in r/all, the harder it is for your sub to get another post to the front page.\n\n&gt; To get around this, moderators can simply remove any posts that are currently sitting in the r/all/hot's top 1000.\n\n&gt; The effect is two-fold:\n\n&gt; 1. The new post they want to promote to the front page will now be at the top of their subreddit's front page, gaining votes very quickly.\n\n&gt; 2. With no current posts in r/all/hot, the new post will hit r/popular and r/all/rising and then snowball to the front page quickly.\n\n&gt; Once the new post is comfortably on the front page, mods can re-approve the posts they removed.\n\nThe blog post has this to say about the timing of reaching the front page:\n\n&gt; Ranking on reddit is determined using a combination of upvotes, downvotes, and the age of the post at the time of each vote.\n\n&gt; Thus, the best way to get your post to the front page is to upvote aggressively when the post is very young.\n\nTherefore, **knowing when you have no current posts in r/all/hot is important to gaming the system, and moderator power allows this to happen with certainty**.  \n\n#Possible Improvements\n\nThere's no way I would suggest weakening moderator powers. Even if a post has made the front page, moderators should be able to remove it. An extreme example might be the content referred to by a post was changed maliciously. \n\nWhat seems to be going on is the act of banning the thread hides the fact it reached the front page.  A possible improvement might be to preserve that history through a ban.  \n\nOne last comment, the front page is about visibility. What people see is what brings them to a community.  I have no problem with moderators who want to carefully curate their subreddits. However, this curation should be well-known and transparent to the ordinary redditor. Otherwise, many redditors may be under the impression their votes are choosing what the rest of reddit sees about their sub, when that is largely not the case.",

        "text": "Imagine if instead of typing comments, our only option was to record our voice and post an audio clip, which could be played by being clicked on by another user. How would this change the Reddit experience? Would this be a net gain or net loss for comment thread quality? I've had a few thoughts:\n\n**Positives:**\n\n**- It would be easier to identify age.** I don't think it's right that (hypothetically) it can be difficult to tell between a 12 year-old and a particularly ignorant/immature adult. I simply don't talk to 12 year-olds in the same way I talk to adults: the strength of my disagreement with someone's view or the language I use would vary dramatically if I knew who I was talking to.\n\n**- The presence of tone would de-escalate tension between users.** We've all seen and been involved in the death-spiral that back-and-forth disagreements sometimes fall into. Text is cold and unfriendly. People take offence when someone posts something they disagree with. I've typed things in the past entirely stoically and I've had users tell me that I'm 'angry' or 'upset' when that couldn't be further from the truth. The disagreements, debates and arguments I have in real life never turn nasty because my interlocutor can always see my mood. Crazy ranting people would be *obviously* crazy ranting people. \n\n**- It would discourage knee-jerk reaction comments.** In a verbal comment you have much more control over the delivery of your ideas. There's no risk of someone glancing cursorily over your post, thinking they get your meaning and then disagreeing vehemently without having read it properly. \n\n**Negatives:**\n\n**- It may lead to a nastier sort of cyber-bullying**. The misogynists and racists are out there. It's doubtless that a verbal comment system would attract such nastiness. Then again, is it right to blame a platform for the behaviour of its users?\n\n**- It would be exclusionary.** There are those who for whatever reason could not speak and so would not comment using the new system (either for medical reasons or for lack of a microphone). As well as the unfairness of this, there would definitely be fewer people making comments. But perhaps quality is more desirable than quantity.\n\nThoughts?",

I have plenty of posts where I make a post, I see dedicated and great comments that have upvotes and I am left with a 1 for a good while. I don't want to beg for upvotes since that usually leads to downvotes. But I do feel like if they spent a lot of time and energy to comment, then they should have upvoted as well to give visibility. I want to know why people do this and if there is anyway to politely remind people to vote without receiving backlash or genuinely be a karmawhore. \n \nPersonally, I don't need the karma. But when I try to start discussions I usually want more people to join so I can gain more insight and share it as well. ",

The analysis is meant to be content-agnostic, however, so anything directly relating to an individual user's preferred subject matter or subreddit is out. I also have no access to data about posts, so this is all about comments.\n\nInitial analysis has revealed frustratingly few meaningful results. Of the ~13 million commenters found, more than 10 million had made fewer than 10 comments total. This in itself is somewhat interesting but not unexpected.\n\nBeyond that, it seems that clustering (k-means if you're interested) results in discrimination primarily by number of comments alone. In aggregate, score and number of distinct subreddits are highly correlated with raw number of comments (the former was expected, the latter was not necessarily), while comment length seems fairly uniform across all users. All these factors make for uninteresting clusters overall.\n\nI had hoped I might find evidence of very distinct types of users - essayists who drop knowledge in long, well-received posts, specialists who stick to a single subreddit and comment there a lot, power users who accrue mountains of karma making short comments in hundreds of subs, etc. But my selected measures have failed to reveal such patterns. Hence the title question: What measures do you think would be best for teasing out these distinctions? Or are the vast majority of redditors too homogeneous and omnivorous for any such groups to stand out?",

He claims that it's because the algorithm only allows one hot post on a small sub at once.\n\nAs someone who lurks many small subs, I can confirm that that is totally true. One post per day \"wins\" and can make it to /r/popular with 10k+ upvotes, while everything else squanders at ~30. There is a very obvious 24 hour \"cooldown\" of sorts, and getting a popular post becomes a question of timing rather than quality.\n\nIs this a good behavior of the reddit algorithm? The issue doesn't seem to affect posts on larger subreddits. I don't know if they are treated differently by the system, or if the sheer number of users overcomes the \"cooldown.\"\n\nThoughts?",

While almost all of what I see come out of them are cherrypicked propaganda and dumb memes, occasionally something really resonates with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI feel very conflicted about how to deal with some of these posts, and thought I'd share my quandary and hopefully get some insights about what makes for a better philosophy of voting. Is it better to upvote based on the content of the post alone, or weigh heavily the context in which it rose to visibility? \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the one hand, I feel it's important to engage with the idea, not who said it. Ad hominem attacks are bad - by the same logic one shouldn't discredit a good idea just because it came from a disreputable source. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n On the other hand, I don't want to be offering endorsement/increasing visibility/support for some of these groups, especially when the same idea could just have easily been expressed elsewhere. Is it better to respond with 'you're right, but I don't like you. downvoted', and then take that post and repost it somewhere else where it won't have that unfortunate association?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI think these issues are also relevant to posts coming from subs you are a regular/active community member of, but send to the front page some shitpost that doesn't really resonate with the core culture of the sub and you think is somewhat of an embarrasment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n What strategy makes for a better overall reddit community?

        "text": "So, there are several subreddits dedicated to debating inequality and other phenomenon, often from the paradigm of hierarchical economic structure versus genetics being the cause various inequalities. One subreddit in particular comes to mind, /r/FeMRADebates. This community has a stark lack of actual feminists, the majority of those in the discussions identify as either egalitarians or men's rights activists. While the premise is interesting, some of their content seems somewhat demeaning. On their frontpage right now is a blunt, assertive title linking to a study about how women's brains are smaller than men's. Could the frankness with which inferiority is implied possibly drive away women or people who identify as feminist from wanting to engage? If so, does this create a confirmation bias for people with opposing viewpoints? \n\nBut wait, you might say, maybe there are simply less feminists on Reddit in general. But /r/trollxchromosomes, a predominantly feminist sub, absolutely has a massive user base. Not to mention /r/askwomen and /r/twoxchromosomes. Meanwhile, masculine-oriented subs are generally smaller. Why don't the women of the feminist portion of Reddit pour into subreddits like /r/purplepilldebate? \n\nI personally think that women and other minorities generally avoid those types of communities because it's mentally and emotionally taxing to have to keep justifying yourself as a human being. Most people go on Reddit for fun or to be informed. Making yourself explain to other people that you're not inferior serves neither of those two. However, if one does subscribe to theories about inferiority, these subreddits may serve a purpose of feeling informed because of the confirmation bias. Not to mention, it's probably less emotionally exhausting to feel superior to others than to explain why you're not worth less.",

        "text": "I recently found, through /r/gamesociety/, that Reddit is doing away with CSS, to many users' disapproval. This on top of other recent announcements like considerable changes to various reddit algorithms and adding user pages, led me to write up the following:\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to suggest you not keep your hopes up about Reddit caring too much about what users want vs what advertisers want\n\n&gt; It looks like reddit is repeating what Wikia did almost a decade ago: start moving heavily towards commercial viability in spite of user disagreement. I was an active user there when Wikia started pushing hard for new layout designs and 'social media'-like features to attract $$$. Reddit is now doing the same. That was one of the reasons I left Wikia, and why several wikis like WikiFur and Halopedia left, too:\n\n&gt;&gt; In mid-August 2010, Halopedia's hosting service, Wikia, introduced a new mandatory skin change codenamed \"Oasis\" along with the removal of Monaco skin, and an update of the terms of use to the Wikia community. Declared by many to be a maintanence burden, Wikia defended its position for the removal of Monaco skin and offered the community a chance to experience the new skin. Though the skin is described by Wikia as \"sleek\" and helpful to newer users, it faced a lot of opposition from a significant amount of the Wikia community over what they saw as reduced accessibility and had unnecessary features. In addition, veteran contributors felt that Wikia's updated terms of use greatly restricted creativity and community freedom of each wiki, something the Wikia community had enjoyed when using older skins.\nAfter a community consensus initiated by administrator Nicmavr, a majority voted to move back to its independent domain, halopedian.com, on October 17th, 2010. The wiki was moved again to its original domain, halopedia.org, in summer 2012.\n\n&gt; https://www.halopedia.org/Halopedia:History\n\nThe result of this process on Wikia was such that in many ways, it became unrecognizable to me. I was once an admin on wikia.com (as well as several other wikis), yet looking now at the wikia.com front page, it's completely unrecognizable, and I don't even understand how to navigate the page because it's so busy. I believe the underlying wiki framework is under all that fluff somewhere, but I'd have to log in and switch back to the ancient, Wikipedia-like layout to make sense of everything. \n\nI can see this happening to Reddit (it already happens to subreddits that suddenly explode in popularity outside of their actual core users), and am unsure what it means for its future. Youtube is currently in quite a volatile state as well, yet also has incredible momentum in the modern internet. I believe the results may be similar to facebook: it has become so huge that 99% have a facebook even if they don't use it as much as they used to, and an opportunity is made for newer alternatives like facebook messenger, snapchat, or instagram to grab the more substantial engagement. \n\nThis will result in a vacuum of content, leading to more low-hanging fruit posts as the only way to balance between a ballooning population of content consumers and dwindling population of content creators is the kind of user that can churn out low-effort, lowest common denominator content, similar to what SoFlo Antonio has become infamous for doing on Youtube and Facebook.\n\nThe question then is, can reddit avoid sacrificing quality in user experience in trying to improve commercial viability, or is reddit already so huge that they essentially have a captive audience? And in either case, what can we users do to make sure our experience is not disregarded?",

The reddit that we **are** is the reddit that downvotes things when we disagree and upvotes things that we like with tons of room for personal biases and such.\n\nIn the image I provided, people like one opinion so they upvoted it. They disliked an opposing opinion so they downvoted it. The entire conversation contributes to reddit as a whole because it provides a dialogue of two differing opinions. The ironic thing is that the conversation is about the very same subject which is why it works so well as an example.\n\nI know it looks like I'm trying to re-invent the wheel here and maybe I am. But maybe we, as a community, should all just decide to embrace the idea that upvote/downvote system is basically a like/dislike system. If you head over to any political subreddit you will see that it is basically the law of the land already.",

        "text": "As I've started to pay more attention to users on reddit, I've noticed that the front page is populated largely by posts from accounts with a large amount of post karma.  It's not uncommon for these accounts to have hundreds of thousands of karma per year of age, and they show up on the front page day after day.  \n\nBased on karma scores alone, it's obvious that these \"serial front pagers\" are focused on getting their posts seen and upvoted - and many of them, upon closer inspection, are revealed to focus *exclusively* on that, with little or no participation of other kinds.  Clearly this is a unique \"class\" of reddit user.  \n\nWhat gives me pause is consideration of their motives.  The average person doesn't have the combination of time and willingness to trawl the internet for catchy content to post on reddit.  Most of us just post stuff we encounter organically, maybe even some OC.  So what's driving the serial front pagers?  Do they just want the recognition?  Doubtful - most people don't even seem to read usernames.  Is it for the delicious internet points?  Maybe, but I don't think that adequately explains the number and output of these accounts.  \n\nIt's an open secret that there are parties interested in using reddit to influence public opinion - be it through astroturfing, sneaky advertising, shilling, or otherwise.  I wonder if some of the serial front page accounts are being run by ad companies in order to slip in some marketing now and then?  It wouldn't have to be every post - maybe 9/10 front page posts are reposts and stuff mined from Facebook, but the other 1/10 are new movie trailers or photos with a brand prominently displayed.  No one could prove it - obviously the user is a karma whore, not a marketer! - but the content would still get seen when it matters.  \n\nOf course, there are myriad objections to this line of thought, not least of which is \"dude, they're not working for anyone; lay off the tin foil\".  There's also the fact that the posts get upvoted to the front page largely *because* they're what people want to see, and so these serial front pagers are doing reddit a service.  You could make the argument that, without these karma-chasing link posters, reddit would lose a large part of what makes it attractive: entertaining content.  But then there's yet another potential objection - by allowing the front page to be dominated by the easy-karma posts favored by serial posters, are we allowing OC and unique content to be drowned out?  I think that may well be the case.  \n\nSo I'm torn on how to approach these accounts.  Should we encourage them, in recognition of the way they keep the front page stocked with crowd-approved content?  Or should we discourage them, either for their dumbing-down effect, their stifling of other users, or their elevated potential for narrative control?  \n\nI don't know the answer.  What do you think?  ",
