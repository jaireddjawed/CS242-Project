        "text": "Hey all I’m kinda new to the watch game beyond ‘hey that looks cool’\n\nI came across U-Boat recently and my google-fu combined with my basic knowledge of watches told me that these watches would be poor value for money, for the following reasons:\n\n-\tlack of information on movement, site seems ambiguous, I’m reading that it’s an ETA 2824-2 with a GMT function.\n-\tthe materials used for their cases don’t appear to be value for money when compared to other watches at the same price with the same case materials\n-\tcompany was founded in 2000 by no one in particular who was the grandson of someone who never actually made a watch. The marketing dribble seems to Never ending.. if it’s a good watch.. you shouldn’t need to talk so much.\n\n\nObviously there is a lot to be said about design, looks and wearability but anyone can have an opinion on that. I want to learn more about how to identify quality pieces, so if in my travels I see a piece that I like the look, I can do a bit of digging to understand the value and if I’m willing to pay above that value.\n\nSo how did I go?\nAnyone disagree that these watches are poor value for money? If so please share your thoughts.\nIf you agree but on other points of merit please, share them too. \n\nThanks\n\nTL;DR U-Boat watches? overpriced/poor value for money Y/N?\n\n[U-Boat Website](https://www.uboatwatch.com/about-us/)",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nSuper excited to share my first automatic watch ever. This joins my (now) small collection - I also own a Longines HydroConquest (Quartz) in blue which I absolutely love. \n\nThis was bought for me by my parents as a combined birthday and wedding gift. \n\nAfter a lot of research, I thought a smart purchase would be a simple and classy dress watch - which was versatile enough to wear on most occasions. Thus I settled on this B&amp;M. What makes this a (I think) great purchase is the convenience and technological features of this piece - as a first time automatic watch owner, winding a watch every other day or wearing such an expensive watch everyday just to keep it running can get a bit overwhelming. The 5 day PR is a godsend in this regard. The high resistance to magnetism ans use of long lasting lubricants also go some way into making me feel more comfortable about longevity and cost of ownership. \n\nWhile buying the watch was great fun, I got completely hooked onto this sub as a result, and have ended up scrolling through it almost every day.",

        "text": "It's Thursday and not much is happening. So we'll get though this really quickly. Shame yesterday's edition got caught by the filters here because of the amount of links because it was a HUGE news day.\n\n# What's new\n\n[**Citizen Brings Asian Fan Favorite Tsuyosa Line to Europe, Renames It Citizen ME**](https://timeandtidewatches.com/citizen-me-is-a-crazy-value-proposition-thats-edging-closer-to-worldwide-availability/)\n\n/ The Citizen Tsuyosa became an immediate hit in watch enthusiast circles, despite the difficulties of getting one, as it was only available in select Asian markets. Now, Citizen is introducing new dial colors and renaming the 80s vintage inspired collection to Citizen ME to launch it in Europe. \n\nThe Citizen ME’s dial looks like the Rolex Oyster Perpetual’s, with its baton-style hands and applied indices. Previously, the model was offered with black, blue, green, and yellow dials. Now, four new options enter the repertoire – a deep blue with a grained texture, a Tiffany-like blue, teal, and red – all of them with a sunray brushed and fumé effect. Other than the red variant, each colour comes in a stainless-steel case, while the red one is in a rose gold-plated one. Speaking of the case, it’s 40mm x 11.7mm, the bracelet is integrated and the watch is powered by the Citizen 8210 movement. \n\nCitizen ME will be available from June/July in Europe (you can get it in some Asian markets already) at a price of €299 for the steel version and €349 for the rose gold plated version. \n\n[**Vieren Gold Mirror Special Edition is a funky 70s disco timepiece**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/vieren-debuts-limited-run-gold-mirror-special-edition-watch/)\n\n/ The 70s are making one hell of a comeback. While those who have lived through the era will tell you that this is not necessarily a good thing. While the music and movies might have been awesome, the 70s are not always the go-to era when you think of great fashion. \n\nHowever, the 70s revival in the watch game has had some success so far, with the muted brown and funky dials. Now, a young Canadian brand named Vieren is banking on this trend with their Vieren Gold Mirror Special Edition, inspired by the opulent lifestyle of Studio 54 guests. \n\nThe Vieren Gold Mirror Special Edition is 41.5mm-long by 27mm-wide and plated in 18K gold. The dial is, honestly, impressive for such a young brand. It’s equally minimal, with a matte gold hours scale with engraved line indices, augmented by a similarly elemental engraved minutes track on the polished vertical rehaut, and maximalist with a skeleton window at the center which frames elements of the gear train behind a polished gold plate. The movement inside is fairly basic - the ETA 2671, but it looks good enough. \n\nThe Vieren is very cool, very disco and not terribly expensive if you are looking for something different - $5,250.\n\n[**Looking For a Watch To Go Skiing With? This Alpina Would Be Great If It Were a Third Of The Price**](https://escapementmagazine.com/articles/alpina-alpiner-extreme-automatic-freeride-world-tour-2023.html/)\n\n/ As the official timekeeper of the Freeride World Tour, a competition in which skiers and snowboarders throw themselves down rocky mountainsides, Alpina has just debuted the Alpina Alpiner Extreme Automatic Freeride World Tour 2023. \n\nIt’s not a terrible watch. As a sports option, you could do worse. The stainless steel case measures 41 x 42.5 mm, 11.50 mm in height and seems to be fairly rugged. It’s powered by Alpina’s caliber AL-525 which is based on the robust and simple to service Sellita caliber SW200-1 a. \n\nThere’s just one bit issue with the watch - the price of €1,595. If it were a third of that price, it would be fantastic value for money.\n\n[**Hautlence Comes Out With a New Version Of Their Linear Series, Now In Black PVD**](https://monochrome-watches.com/hands-on-hautlence-linear-series-2-full-black-pvd-ad50-st01-specs-price/)\n\n/ Hautlence is an interesting brand. In September 2022, after a few years of no new models, MELB Holding (also the owner of H. Moser &amp; Cie.) decided to relaunch the brand with a collection that enjoys all the advantages of indie watchmaking - TV-shaped case and original displays. This took the shape of two watches, the Vagabonde Series 4 with wandering hours and, the most striking of the two, the Linear Series 1, a watch that takes on the classic cues of the brand. And now, it’s back in black, with the Hautlence Linear Series 2. \n\nHautlence watches relies on jumping indications and retrograde hands, with full exposure of the mechanism driving these complex displays. This very interesting dial is mounted on top of the calibre D50, also known as the automatic tourbillon calibre HMC 804 when encased in Moser watches. The whole assembly consists of 239 components. \n\nThe Hautlence Linear Series 2 Black PVD is released as a limited edition of 28 pieces. The retail price will be CHF 63,000 including taxes.\n\n[**Atelier de Chronométrie Partners with The Lavish Attic on Ultra Limited AdC33**](https://wornandwound.com/atelier-de-chronometrie-partners-with-the-lavish-attic-on-ultra-limited-adc33/)\n\n/ Atelier de Chronométrie teams up with The Lavish Attic, a Hong Kong based collective that curates exclusive high craft products and experiences, to produce the AdC33 watch with some extremely interesting dials and cases. \n\nThe case is offered in a very interesting precious metal the brand calls gray gold, a gold alloy with high palladium content that apparently lands somewhere between white gold and platinum in appearance. The white grand feu dial is inspired by Chinese pottery, further aided by the blued steel applied Chinese antique indexes. \n\nJust 8 pieces of the AdC33 are planned for production, so don’t expect to run into one at your local meet up anytime soon. The price will run around 65,000 Euros for the precious metal options, though steel will also be available for those more budget conscious at around 60,000 Euros,\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# On hand - a selection of review\n\n[**A Blog To Wach Tests Out the interesting Union Glashütte Noramis Date Sport**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-review-union-glashutte-noramis-date-sport/)\n\n[**A review of the Montblanc Heritage Small Second Limited Edition 38, a Brilliant Movement Finishing In An Under-appreciated Watch**](https://watchesbysjx.com/2023/03/montblanc-heritage-small-second-38-minerva-salmon.html)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n[**Insiders Say This French Brand Is The Go-To For Advanced In-House Watchmaking At Attractive Prices**](https://www.fratellowatches.com/made-in-france-pequignet-royale-saphir-bleue/)\n\nThe brand Pequignet and the Royale Saphir model are clearly off the beaten track, and that is their strength.

I'm curious about what those markers represent, as I haven't seen them on other watches before. If anyone has any insights or knows of other watches with similar features, please let me know.\n\nIn terms of my overall opinion on Breitling, I think the brand has a strong heritage and a reputation for creating high-quality timepieces. I'm interested to see where they're headed under the leadership of CEO Georges Kern, who has been working to modernize and streamline the brand's offerings.\n\nWhile I'm a fan of the Premier line, I have to admit that the new Navitimers and Superoceans haven't really caught my eye. I'm curious to see what other models Breitling has in the works and how they'll continue to innovate and evolve in the coming years.",

        "text": "I have an Omega Seamaster Men's 300M Watch 2221.80.00 that was purchased in 2010. It has had full service conducted on it twice with the latest time being in March 2020. Recently there has been a problem with the power reserve not lasting 48 hours - more specifically, there seems to be something obstructing the the transfer of energy to the hands of the watch. Each time the watch stops, I just need to tap it to get the hands moving again. \n\nI brought it to an Omega boutique and all the tests that they ran came up fine. The employee said the only option was to conduct another full service. I informed him it has only been three years since its last full service but he insisted that there's nothing else that can be done and a full service is needed on a watch of my age about every 3-5 years. \n\nI'm aware that the watch is now past the two-year warranty after its last full service but needing to pay another $700 only after three years seems kind of ridiculous? The customer service for this caliber of watches is also striking me as lacking. Should I push back on this? Am I getting squeezed for another $700? Is there any way around this?\n\nThank you in advance for the replies.",
