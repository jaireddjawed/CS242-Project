Every now and then we get miss routes for home services. \n\nCall from a year ago. \n\nCall comes in and I give my warm greeting\n\nMe- thank you for calling telecommunications company, my name is… who do I have the pleasure of working with today. \n\nAngry elderly lady(ael) - what does my name have to do with anything, I need help with my tablet \n\nMe- I need it to verify your account so that I can start troubleshooting your tablet. \n\nAel- fine it’s … \n\nMe- and your last name please \n\nAel audibly sighs. I just need help with my tablet \n\nMe- I promise to help with your tablet but first I need to verify the account to be able to pull my troubleshooting tools up for it. \n\nAt this point I also realize the system has pulled a home services account. \n\nMe- also, I apologize but your home service account came up. May I have your wireless number or the number to your tablet so I can pull the correct account up to help you. \n\nAel- what does any of that have to do with my tablet. I just need to know where the memory card goes\n\nAt this point I’m thinking maybe she doesn’t have cell with us and that she bought an android tablet somewhere. I just want to help her so I start asking probing questions about it. \n\nMe- ok maybe I can guide you through this, what brand is your tablet. \n\nAel- you should have that in YOUR records I bought it from YOU \n\nMe- ok ma’am it must be connected to your cell phone account then. And I can’t see any of those records until I access that account to see what type it is. May I have your cell number please. \n\nAel continuing to raise her voice and aggression- just tell me where the damn memory card goes. \n\nMe- I really want to help you, I promise you, but there are dozens of tablet manufacturers, and hundreds of tablets, and many, even if the same brand, have different memory card locations. If you want me to be able to help you I either need to get into the account your tablet is attached to, or know the make and model of your tablet. \n\nAel- no the memory card has always gone in the same place. But I can’t find it.\n\nMe- well then they don’t always go in the same place, do they?\n\nAel- you really are a smart a.. aren’t you \n\nMe- maam. I am smart and I am good at my job but to help you I need information you aren’t giving to me. \nPlease may I have your wireless number so that I can access your account and help guide you through inserting your memory card. \n\nAel- here. I found the box. It’s an iPad\n\nMe- ohhhh it’s not a memory card. You’re trying to install he SIM card so you get cellular service on it. Ok. You have the box, can you…\n\nAel cuts me off- NO IHAVE A MEMORY CARD FROM MY OTHER TABLET I WANT TO PUT INTO THIS SO MY PHOTOS GO IN IT. WHY ARENT YOU LISTENING. \n\nMe- I’m really sorry ma’am. Apple devices don’t take memory cards. \n\nAel- I’m going to cancel my service because of YOU. \nClick\n\nDeep breath but I am obligated to call back. \n\nAel- pleasant as heck. “Hello”\n\nMe- this is … with telecommunications company. I think..\n\nAel. I was on the phone with Apple not telecommunications company. Why are you calling me…\n\nMe- sorry ma’am. It was me with telecommunications company \n\nAel - no wonder you didn’t know what you were talking about. You’re all a bunch of idiots. I canceled you years ago. Don’t call me again. \nClick. \n\nThinking to myself after. \nWho was she threatening to cancel??\n\nSigh. On to the next",

I took a 2 week vacation over Christmas and during that time I decided I could no longer handle the office politics, the bullshit job of being a TL intern and the pitting of me against the other TL Intern, and wasting my life away in a cubicle in front of a computer. I came back for one week, did next to no work, and applied for Electrical Engineering at my local college. on Friday I got accepted in to the program and I let my employer know I would be starting the program immediately the next week. At first I was open to going in part time, but when they said I would have to work at least 2 8 hour shifts per week, I said fuck it, I’m done. Not happening, never again. A huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and luckily I am estimated to receive a ton of grant money to help fund my schooling. Let this be a message to you folks, I’d you are sick of working in a call centre there are ways out, you can make a change. At 25 I figured there was no time to lose so I made it happen as quickly as possible. I strongly encourage those that don’t want to be stuck in a job like this anymore to consider all avenues out. I don’t regret a thing.",

You ever seen that graph that shows around 10 companies own everything? It's one of those 10. \n\n\nOur center provided support for phone, email, live chat, as well as all the companies social media accounts. The last year or so this company has gotten very cheap and stingy. A lot of positions disappearing. People quitting. The people left being asked to do 3x the work and eventually quitting from burnout. I considered myself one of the lucky ones because my job was very easy and the contact volume was low. The gravy train stopped this week. \n\n\nI asked someone in management and they gave me a very blunt answer. The people in (unspecified Asian country) will work for less than 20% of what they pay Americans. Despite this company posting record profits in the billions last quarter, they are cutting every nickel and dime they can. \n\n\nThe only department left is phones. They want to save money, but know it would massively piss off their customers if they call and hear a foreign accent. But I suspect we're still on borrowed time. \n\n\nGuess it's time to update the resume and start looking elsewhere. Possibly even another field. Between the low pay, high stress, and the fact that this job will be lost to outsourcing and/or automation soon, the writing is on the wall. It's time to go.",

        "text": "Many years ago, over a decade at least, I used to work for a cold-call survey center in Rexburg Idaho while attending school.  The hours were awful, you were only paid based on completed surveys, and they could be any length from five minutes to an hour each, but it was one of the only places hiring and I needed the cash.\nThe best part of working there was that the cold-call system used a random number generator type program to generate phone numbers.  You may start with a call in Idaho then the next call would be Montana and the next could be in Washington.  The one interesting part is that with enough luck you could get some really fun calls if you happened to get just the right rng with the generator.\nA few gems that I got was once calling an internal line at an ambulance dispatch station where I was yelled at by an EMT for disrupting their response system since I was taking up a line that they needed to send out first responders to emergencies.  Another time I ended up calling in to a live radio station in Oklahoma and fumbled through an apology live on the air before dropping the call.\nThis particular call was near the end of my shift on a Friday.  The call connected and I started my usual script, “Hello, my name is TexanPirate with Research Company, do you have a few minutes to complete a survey?”  The gentleman responded with a deep sigh and angrily responded “how is it that you people always end up calling right when we sit down to dinner?  I’ve asked a million times to be removed from your list and I can’t believe that y’all are stupid enough to keep calling!”  \nAfter having a particularly long and not-very profitable day due to minimal completed surveys, I was tired and just done for the night.  “Sir, it’s nearly 8 o’clock here where my building is located.  You may be sitting down for dinner, but I’m still at work.  Do you have time for a survey or not?”  After a short pause that I prefer to believe was due to some introspection into his life, he simply said no and hung up on me.  Thankfully no supervisors magically ever happen to get the late shift so no one was listening in on the call to get upset at me.  I ended up leaving soon after that anyway due to the semester ending so I never really looked back.",

Did it complete the purchase and the fail afterwards? Did you get an email about it?\n\nHim- nothing it just won't go through\n\nMe- (internally: so this is human error...) Have you added in all the required fields?\n\nAfter walking through every part of the purchase he lands on the fact that his billing information isn't correct because our website doesn't allow him to enter a different billing vs delivery address. \n\n(That's a lie by the way not only do I purchase from our company online regularly, but whenever I walk through with someone I pull up a screen and go through each step) \n\nWhen I pointed out where he could go to change the billing address there was a moment of silence, furious typing and then his denial of it not being there. \n\nMe - sir Iare you on a desktop? \n\nHim - yes\n\nMe - then I'm not sure how you aren't seeing it I am going through step by step with you on the customer website. \n\nHim - well it's not there.\n\nMe - okay let me see if I can take over your cart and we can do the purchase over the phone. \n\nHim - no no it's fine this has taken too long as is, I need to get back to work. I'll call back later. \n\nMe - okay sorry I couldn't help you complete this and solve your intermittent issue. If it happens again please let us know and we will escalate to IT. \n\nAfter ending the call I refresh his profile and low and behold there is his new completed order with separate billing and delivery addresses. \n\nLike sir who wins when you lie???",

A few of the higher-ups (who are no longer with the company) made a poor business decision to the tune of *millions* of dollars.\n\nFast forward a year and a wildly successful, almost 50-year-old company is on the verge of bankruptcy. We reached out to several places for investment, and one of them said they wouldn't invest but were interested in buying us.\n\nWe went for it. Didn't really have a choice. To be fair, since they bought us, they paid all the back bills. They let around 70% of the company go - with generous severance packages - and have thus far been fair to those of us that they kept on. They even made sure that, although their PTO practices are different from ours, we wouldn't lose any accrued time. \n\nTheir other supervisors - and overall most of their customer service and sales departments - are very friendly and helpful. They even gave me a shout-out at today's meeting for being active in the supervisors' group chat since they added me a week ago.\n\nThe problem is...their shipping/fulfillment staff. Being a previously small company, we're all used to being one team. I have enlisted the help of, and often helped, the international- and domestic-shipping departments, as well as sales, purchasing, accounting, brand management, freight shipping, wholesale, etc. \n\nThe new company operates as though their various departments are very, very separate. Additionally, we're in a southernish state, whereas the new company is not. I don't know if it's a culture or a business thing, but their shipping and fulfillment staff seem very disrespectful.\n\nThey talk over me or talk to each other as though I'm not there. They announce decisions without any understanding of how we operate, and when I try to help, they just interrupt with their decisions (even the employees that I technically outrank) and walk away from the discussion.\n\nIt's not just me; it's my boss and everyone else from any other department. They have been friendly and accommodating to our employees in shipping and fulfillment, but are so dismissive of me, my boss, and many others from other departments.\n\nAm I just being too sensitive? Is it cultural (northeastern US vs Southeastern US)? I want to continue to operate as a team, but these guys treat me like I'm either invisible or clueless, and it's wearing on me. My boss and team depend on my positivity and I'm struggling.",

Pretty damn good at my job, but lots to learn still.\n\nSweet elderly lady (SL) calls in — awesome! They’re my favorite; I actually enjoyed helping them with super simple technology problems. They were easy to please and chatted nicely while I did my thing.\n\nI don’t remember how we got to this topic during our small talk, but it went something like this…\n\nSL: I’m in the hospital at the moment.\nMe: oh, I’m sorry to hear that!\nSL: thank you\nMe: well I hope you’re feeling better soon.\nSL: oh, I wont. I’m dying. \n(said in a very sweet but matter-of-fact tone, mind you)\n\nCue my stunned silence because what on earth am I supposed to say to that? I’m barely out of training! They don’t prep you for this 😐.\nAnd then immediate guilt for the stunned silence, probably followed by some stuttering. I don’t remember the rest, except that she never broke that sweet little old lady demeanor of hers. ❤️\n\n\nAnyway, that’s the day I learned to avoid saying “I hope you feel better” unless the caller specifically confirms it’s a recoverable problem…🫥🫣…like a cold, or a broken ankle.",

        "text": "I may not be in CS anymore, but I have to say I did Call Center Customer Service overall for 10ish years over multiple companies.\n\n\\*Disclaimer some of this story is 3rd party as I wasn't 100% in on each conversation \\*\n\nThis story starts at my nearly last Call Center job, working the Team Lead/Escalations/Tier 2, of a home decor site.\n\nThose of us on the team had a few back office responsibilities  to perform throughout the day such as clearing part request to ensure they were done properly/monitor the outdated ones were being followed up on by the Customer Service Rep (CSR), We would check freight shipment pick-ups for customer refunds \\^no one is more pissed than a person waiting on a refund\\^.\n\nThe other task we did was submit to Accounting requests for refunds from In-Store Credit (ISC). The company would use ISC as a means to buy a replacement product (sometimes with expectations of a returned product and other times with expectation the product would be destroyed/disposed of and a replacement product sent).\n\nLo and behold the ISC refund request from Hell. Our lovely CSR, Sally, received a call from a person holding on to something of the value of $150.00 of ISC for a Chess set they returned \\*4ish\\* years prior. Sally, being the proactive CSR knows that we as a company do extend courtesies out to customers that have been holding onto ISC can request to have the ISC sent back to them as a physical check.\n\nSally does her job and submits the request to request the ISC be refunded back to the ISC holder as requested.\n\nI find myself browsing our back office duties and find this masterpiece of shitfuckery.\n\nThe person who placed the original order is not the person requesting the refund.\n\n\\^HUGE RED FLAG\\^\n\nI already did my prior due diligence and verified all the pertinent details about how this person got ISC in their name while not being the original person who ordered it. I did not pass this request onto the Accounting Department for processing but rather sent the request to their direct supervisor for follow-up and coaching.\n\nYet, the cascade of calamities was yet to begin. The supervisor doing the bare minimum brought dear ol' Sally into a 1-on-1 and discussed how the request couldn't be done and to call the requester back and inform them accordingly.\n\nSally does make a call and leaves a voice mail but to whom?\n\nIt was not to the original caller requesting the ISC Refund.....Sally called the Corporation number of the original order and explained on the voice mail how we could not refund her.\n\nThe person who got the voice mail then contacted the person with the ISC and of course that escalated their issue to the team I was on.\n\nThe supervisor comes to me \"asking\" me to take the escalated call because I was familiar with the situation. Oh joy, I get angry lady on the phone and apologize to her profusely about the voice mail and explain the best I can about how refunds can only go back to the original purchaser as is the law. \n\nThis is when I am told why she wanted to keep everything hush hush. The Chess set was from a Christmas Party raffle and she didn't want it or didn't play Chess and someone in the past, well before my time, accepted it back a return for ISC.\n\nI did what I could and since the cat was out of the bag. I informed her if the original purchaser would call in and request the ISC to be sent back as a check in their name we could process it and that person could sign the check over to her and everything would be in the clear.\n\nThis wasn't the most route she wanted to go but was the only means.\n\nDays later browsing the refund queue, we see the request pass it onto Accounting and I hope everyone at the end was satisfied but man that was not a happy Customer Service experience for anyone involved.\n\nThis post might have some past tense present tense swapping but I'm typing it out as is.",

As it happens I used to work inputting details of death certificates (temporary job ages ago),  i.e. checking if a person was deceased.

No matter how many times I saw the date of death as Christmas day/ within a day or so that etc, it would make me feel deep sympathy for them.\n\nCustomer stopped crying and seemed to cheer up a bit, think she was surprised to hear that it was so common.\n\nSo that was the day I became a bereavement counsellor for a moment.

BR explains to me that he's got a very upset lady with a pair of broken earbuds. nothing out of the usual. that's fine. bring her on over. what's the worst that can happen?\n\nKL is upset, very much so. she uses the phrases ''hell no'' and ''this is some bullshit'' like they're punctuation. despite my best attempts to politely butt in, she's rambling so much that i can't really get a word in edgewise. all i can gather is that her earbuds are broken and she needs them repaired ASAP. the left one works fine, but the right one went silent after 15 minutes of use and never came back. that's okay. i ask her if she knows what kind of earbuds they are. she doesn't. no worries. there's a few ways we can get this serial number. do you have the box? no? okay. well, if we open up the charging case, we can see the serial number.\n\nKL: okay, let me get a knife.\nme: wait, what?\nKL: this shit is so hard to open. i mean, this is some bullshit. why should i have to do this? no offense to you, i can see you're a very kind man, but there's clearly some kind of defect.\n\ni'm stunned. i can hear the knife scraping against the case as she struggles to get it open. i want to stop her, but i don't know how. i don't know WHY. does she have the hand strength of an infant? is she attempting to pry open this poor case from the back? in any case, she gives me a serial number. i pull it up. it will help me troubleshoot, and if we do end up needing to get them repaired, i'll need it.\n\nokay, cool. thank you very much for that. can i take a look at your screen? it might be a little bit easier to help you.\n\n''sure, but this is some bullshit.''\n\ni understand. i'll do my best to resolve this. the gears in my brain are shooting off sparks as they churn against each other. she's never tried to disconnect and reconnect the earbuds. her phone's software is out of date. the earbud's software is out of date. i can think of so many things that could be wrong and a manufacturing defect is none of these.\n\nover the course of twenty minutes and a great deal of ''this some bullshit'' and ''i know, i'm sorry'' i convince her that we should begin with software troubleshooting. she reluctantly agrees. i show her how to update the earbud software. the first part involves putting them in and listening to some kind of audio for 30 seconds. i watch her go to spotify, open a song, and... that's it, really. she doesn't tap on the play button. it doesn't play. no attempt at all is made to convey audio, but all the while she is shrieking that she cannot hear anything from the earbuds and that they are broken. i coax her into the next step, placing them in the charge case, where they will remain for 30 minutes. cue ramblings of 'this is a bullshit defect' and 'i want a new pair RIGHT NOW.' \n\ni explain that she doesn't qualify for a replacement due to various factors. she can get an in-store repair (i live two hours away from the nearest store!) or a mail-in repair (i don't want a repaired or a refurbished earbuds, i want a BRAND NEW PAIR!) at some point during this rant, it sticks out to me: she got these from amazon. unable to gain any sort of agreement beyond running in circles, i tell her to hang tight and that i'll get it sorted out as i reach out to E1.\n\nE1 is completely beyond himself. he can't stop laughing at my story and asks me if i think there's physical damage to the case. ''probably?'' i stutter, all things considered. he tells me that, given everything, we aren't going to be able to replace these. if she purchased them from amazon, she could take advantage of their incredibly generous return policy and exchange them. ''are you okay with that?'' E1 asks, kindly giving me the option to end the call on a silver platter. wanting to seem responsible, i say, ''no. i've got this. refer to amazon? no big deal!''\n\nit's a big deal. this causes her to begin rambling even harder, to the point where i have basically given up on speaking. she won't return it to amazon, amazon is bullshit, she does not want to deal with this bullshit, she wants to listen to her music and do you understand that and do you understand that it's some bullshit? oh yes, i do. absolutely. it takes me a good 10 minutes of low-key begging to put her back on hold, as i haven't quite gotten jaded enough to say 'i'm putting you on hold' and be done with it. i reach out to E2. \n\nhe also cannot stop laughing. however, just like E1, he is very sympathetic to my plight, and understands that i've reached the end of my rope when every realistic option is denied. i bring him over and introduce him. KL asks me to stay and says that i've been so professional. i apologize and say that i cannot stay, but that E2 is even better at his job than me. i leave to the tune of ''this some bullshit''.\n\ni am still not sure if she was a scammer, an idiot, or both.",

If I could get a week off the phones every once in a while, I would be a much happier and more efficient employee and not dread logging in to work every day. \n\nMy very first call center job, I got good at it really fast. So they let me start taking sup calls (much lower call volume), the started helping run the OJT program, as well as doing some QA work and covering for supervisors when they were out of the office. The pay was shit... but I was HAPPY. I liked going to work because I knew I'd be doing something different each day and not just sit there attached to a computer by a headset, having people cuss me out all day. \n\nJust something I've been thinking about, and wondering why more call centers don't vary reps duties to keep them from burning out.",

I pulled up her account with her, verifying her details with me.\n\n\nThe conversation, then go something like this: \n\nMe:  ok so what’s out on the account is between two different bills.  The current bill is $100. That’s due in January 5th.  Though there’s also a past due balance of $120. That’s two before the 29th to avoid disconnection.  \n\nCustomer:  OK so if I pay $100 now will that help avoid disconnection?\n\nMe:  no, what is needed to avoid disconnection is to paying at least the past due balance which is $120.  \n\nCustomer:  how much is past due?\n\nMe:  $120.  \n\n\n\nCue this conversation about 10 times a week of essentially people being confused by their bills somehow.   \nSomeone called me last week, complaining that the bill was misleading because I told her exactly how much money was doing her account and not just her Past due Balance.  \n\n  I had to point out the fact that it does break her account balance sound on the second page and the line item charges what the current bill is and what is past due.  \n\n  She said she looked at that already, and says it’s still misleading because the front page doesn’t say it like that.  \n \nAt that point, I didn’t know how to help her.   \n\n\nI just don’t know what is so confusing about all of this.",

But the company caught it, suspended the card, and sent me a new one. I’ve been using it for holiday purchases.\n\nAnd then it was time to pay the bill, which was an odd mix of the double account numbers. I set up my payment from my bank with the old (closed, balances transferred) account #. Money leaves my account last Thursday. Posts to the new account # the same day, less $600. I freely admit that I messed up figuring how to get the payment to the new account. Still, it’s strange that most of the payment went through except for this bit.\n\nI log in and live chat with 3 different reps escalating my problem because it’s complex. Final one eventually tells me to wait 2 more business days and then call back, because the account number they have the (wrong amount of money) from is not my correct bank account. They advise me to call my bank in the morning, which I’ll do. \n\nThen I thank them for their and their team’s detective work and help and wish them a good evening. They replied that I was the most kind, polite person they’d helped tonight. Holy cow, people, have we lost all human decency? I don’t deserve a thank-you for treating a human trying to help me like a human. I hope all of the rest of their callers tonight have some Christmas spirit left. There’s no point in being mean to the people who are trying to help you. They have moms and siblings and children.\n\nBe nice! Rant over.",

        "text": "First post here; Found this reddit with the thought of really wanting to share this one story.\n\nI used to work for the german vaccination hotline which was probably some of the most mentally taxing work i had ever done. Having to deal with desperate folk daily, some understanding and sad but most extremely angry and volatile has made me rethink how comfy that kiosk job was that i had where i had to deal with alcoholics and junkies sometimes. (Got some real good stories from that time, too, but this is not the place)\n\nBut this one call stuck out to me the most, and it made me actually sick to my stomach, hoping to god or whoever is listening that my children will never do something like this.\n\nThis was fairly early in the whole vaccination process, where only select folk where eligible for the vaccine. In this case it was the above 80 year olds. There were mobile vaccination teams specifically for retirement homes, and only for retirement homes, but this didn't deter some folk calling in trying to have on of them come to their home as well.\n\nCue our call; a Daugther whose mother was not able to get to a vaccination centre, demanding that a MVT would come to her home instead. Upon telling her kindly that that is not possible, and telling her about offers like the state paying for transportation she got extremely angry with me, starting her rant on how that is inhumane to expect a 96 year old woman who is blind, can't move, has little to no consciousness who is even unable to go in front of the door with a wheelchair as moving her could be dangerous to go to a vaccination centre, and that she needs it or she will have a high risk of dying.\n\nThe call went on for about 21 minutes in which she started to eventually scream at me for my incompetence, and how dare i not offer a better service and that she wishes to speak to my manager.  Not being able to get a word in, i just hung up. (We were allowed to if people got vile, which happened a lot)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe urge to tell her that at 96, and with that little of actual live, she should maybe just let her mother go, was really large. This is one and a half years ago, and i still think about this.\n\nIt reminded me so much of the kind of person that's unwilling to let their dog go, even as it just keeps suffering, because losing it would be more sad than the relief of passing on from what's clearly not a live anymore.",

It was Sunday afternoon and a call came in from a young college-age girl who was shopping with her mom at the mall; her credit card that she had gotten a few months previous was being declined, even though she had an available balance on the card.\n\nI apologized for the issue, verified her and brought up her account. She had not made a recent payment to her card. I'd encountered this many times before, so I started my speech about credit card billing cycles and due dates. The young girl starts getting a little flustered about having missed a payment, and I can hear her telling her mom about it. Her mother gets upset and takes the phone from her and starts griping loudly in my ear, \"She's a college student! You can't expect her to make a payment every month!\" I calmly explained that that was exactly what was expected of every person who opened a credit card account, as it was in the agreement that they signed - to make the minimum payment every month by the due date. Mom got even more cheesed, fussed some more and ended the call.\n\nI like to imagine that later at dinner that night, while mom, daughter and dad were all gathered at the table in their multi-bedroom, upscale home, discussing the day, that mom would tell dad the indignity their daughter faced because the bank expected her to make a payment every month - how dare they!\n\nAnd dad just smacking his forehead with the palm of his hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNumber 2 - \n\nI got my \"go-to joke\" from a very nice customer:\n\nQuestion: How do you catch a polar bear?\n\nAnswer: You go out on the frozen lake and cut a big hole in the ice. Then you open a can of peas and pour it out right at the edge of the hole. Then when the polar bear comes to take a pea, you kick it in the icehole! :-D :-D",

This was about a year into covid then we were having major supply chain issues and everything was way back ordered. The knives he ordered were in stock, but we stated shopping time was 2-3 weeks as the knives are polished and inspected upon ordering. This man would place an order for $500-1000+ worth of knives, and call us the day after, and every day until he received the order. One order has shipped out? He places a new one, and back to calling us, verbally harassing over where his knives are and how he needs them, and why don’t we have these specific models in stock yet.

It's ben a long and arduous month. \n\n***\n\n**Customer 1 (AKA MR. UPPITY (MU))**\n\n**MU**: (As I'm asking another security quesdtion). Noppe!! I have given you my name and that's all you need.

She has never had a credit card with your company. I would like to report fraud.\n\nNow, this is where in my head I (as someone who has a wealth of experience in investigating fraud through employment at various institutions) just thought, *wait a minute you doofus, you've just admitted to a financial crime because accessing other people's credit files (w/o permission) is a crime. On a recorded line. Oh boy. What a Trumpian move*!\n\n**ME:** Okay sir. Sorry to hear that. Before I can get you to the Fraud Dept. I'll need to just ask a few more security...\n\n**MU:** I SAID NO! I'm not the customer in question, my wife is!! So get me through **NOW!!**\n\nAnd so I transferred him to an already busy line and wrote up the call. When he gets through to the fraud dept, they will crucify him. No redit card company/agency is goingto want to willfully keep a customer like him. \n\nWhen he rang through he first interacted with one of those stupid robot voices and therefore, he came through with \\*all* his information. They, the fraud team will reduce his access to credit and ban him as a customer. This is a credit company that helps peaple with poor/bad credit.

In my two years there I had a lot of crazy people, it's a home security brand after all and those things are beacons to the insane, but none came close the experience I watched the new kid go through.\n\nThis happened a year after I started, at this point I am one of their top trainers, and one of their best customer reps. I also have the highest number of canceled accounts and the sales teams hated me. After a week of training this new redheaded 17 year old boy, we will call him Jack, he finally got his own station next to me. On holidays, or weekends we were usually slow. I fondly remember a Sunday where I got no calls. During our down time we could read, or work on homework so I was reading a book when Jack gets a call. \"Hello and thank you for calling Bane of My Existence Security I'm Jack, can I get your name?\" \n\nAt first the call sounded normal. Dude called us because the wait for Tech Support was 3 1/2 hours and his sales rep gave him our number. Even though we were tech support for the sales reps, but ok. Dude  needed help setting up his outdoor camera. This is common as the damn things are cheaper than a bad hooker, and work less. So Jack is walking him through the process, this usually takes about 20 minutes, an hour if the customer is elderly. After 30 minutes Jack is getting frustrated and the dude is yelling at him. I look up from book to listen in. I was given access to listen in on calls, as a part of the May Be Recorded for Quality Assurance. This dude is ripping Jack a new one. \"Where are your head quarters located, you guys are a scam (duh it's a DIY home security system, what did you expect) I will R\\*\\*\\*\\* your mother, and sister.\" Hold up now, this dude is beyond cussing. \n\nBut Jack being a champ hangs in there. \"Sir I am just trying to help you install your camera. If you would download the app-\" App? THEY HAVEN'T EVEN DONE THE FIRST STEP! I wave the manager over, as we will need their permission to hang up on the customer. \n\nAs if sensing the impending end to the call our dude chills out and says, \"Fine, I will download your damn tracking app.\" I motion for the manager to hang around just in case. Not 10 minutes later Jack is getting yelled at. \"I just googled it and your damn HQ is in Utah. Utah! I bet yer one of those Mormons. You Mormons are thieves. Thieves I tell you! I met you in a past life and YOU ROBBED ME THEN TOO!\" AAAAAAHHH! None of us, that I knew of, were Mormon, nor did it matter as our manager would later explain to him. I am laughing while Jack is hitting his head against the desk. His face is as red as his hair.\n\n\"How would you even know if you met me in a past life?! What if I was a chicken? Can chickens rob people?\"\n\n\"You youuuuuu! Who is your God? Is your God the one true king, OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST? Or is your God the fallen archangel Satan?\"\n\nI am dying. The manager has left at this point since she thought the call would go smoothly. In my laughing fit I wheeze, \"Mushu. My God is Mushu, the dragon of my ancestors.\"\n\nThe people around us break down laughing, but the thing was, our mics were REALLY sensitive. I didn't know that, no one told me. \"I KNEW IT! YOU ARE DEVIL WORSHIPPERS.\" Someone ran out to grab the manager but they had left for the day, and the Tech Support manager just told us to tell the dude that a manager will speak to him tomorrow and leave a note on her desk. Jack motions for me to shut up, but I can't so I get up and take a couple laps around the building to calm down.\n\n When I came back the call had ended. Jack said, the dude began accusing him of being a robot, before speaking like a robot. The dude agreed to a manager calling him tomorrow. I believe our manager at the time walked him through setting up the camera, but he called back a little over a month later for help installing them. That was my call with him, but it wasn't nearly as entertaining as Jack's, but I might share it one day.",

They cannot speak to customers as they *do not* have phones so even if I wanted to transfer I cannot\n\nCustomer: But I need to speak to someone!\n\nUs: All that we can do is take all the details from you and forward them an email to try and speed up the process. Either this or you send another email to them and mark it as high importance\n\nCustomer: But they haven’t replied to the email I sent to them three days ago, they aren’t responding to me and I need to find out what is happening. Please connect me to them or find someone who can help me\n\nUs: Again, they are an email only team. There is no physical way for us to transfer customers through to them. You have two options. We can email them for you to try and speed the process up. Or you can send another email and mark it as high importance. You cannot speak to them\n\nCustomer: Surely there is someone who can help me\n\nAnd this is when we start banging our heads on desks. This happens multiple times a day and usually goes up the chain to management where they are once again, told exactly the same thing only for customers to huff before hanging up.",

They said they went to an ATM, checked their balance, and tried to withdraw $180. \n\n\"Okay, lemme see why that was declined...huh, okay, well the reason that was declined is that you have a negative balance.\"\n\n**WHAT!? I have the ATM RECIEPT!**\n\n\"Hmmm...alright, I'll do a little more checking...\"\n\n**The ATM said I had $740 in my account!**\n\n*The account in question has never had that amount...ever. I relay this information.*\n\n**I HAVE THE RECIPT! IT SAYS THIS! AND IT SAYS THAT! SOMEBODY IS PULLING MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT!**\n\n\"Yes, the receipt says that, however I can see your whole account history, and you have never had that amount. Ever.\"\n\n**The receipt says $740, I wanted $180. Where is my money?**\n\n\"You never had those funds. Never even in the account. Never deposited. That was declined because you have no money.\"\n\n*And then they start cursing. I'm pretty lenient because it doesn't really bother me all that much, but I do have limits. Where I work, we give them ONE warning. Then we can straight up hang up on them. Its so nice. So I warn them. Something to keep in mind, I only warn the people who I know are going to fuck up.*\n\nThe next ten minutes were uneventful, with the customer reading out what the receipt said, me volleying back with the closest way of just pointing out that the ATM was wrong, and reminding them they never had the money that they imagined they had. And they are getting frustrated, asking me **Are you listening to me?** And all I could think is *yes, I am, yet you are clearly not listening to me.* And I remain obstinate. I can't conjure up his cash nor can I change the past. And, well, honestly, a thirty minute call isn't actually so bad, especially when you're pretty sure they're gonna hit your trap card.\n\n*And they do.*\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of saying the same thing and hearing the same thing, customer loses their cool, and just says **Fucking...you aren't fucking helping me.**\n\nI remind him of the warning, and promptly hang up. Make a note of abusive language, and move on. I like to think I ruined his day for half an hour then got paid for it. The abusive callers are actually the most fun. I hate the old ladies who just want to check their balance and hang up. I love the people that want me to listen to them, but they don't listen to me.",

I’ve always seen where people talk about this job being a “soul crusher” or that it starts effecting your mental health and I never believed it until I started realizing what it was really doing to me. I only do this job because I already have experience and every collections job is revolving and they’ll take anyone and it pays the bills but my god has it drained me to my core. Today I think I hit my final straw. I struggle everyday to get out of bed dreading the work day. What makes it worse aside from dealing with miserable people all day is my upper management is constantly emailing us about our statistics on how we need to make sure we’re always hitting our goal when most the time it’s not our fault if we don’t hit our goal it’s the fact that people just don’t wanna pay their bills in general they want to pay for other things they need to put food on the table and a roof over their head. They don’t care about something it’s already past due that hit collections. They are angry and will use you as a punching bag when all we as collectors are trying to do is help them resolve their debt. I’m so tired … I want to quit but don’t have a job lined up and I need to be able to pay my bills but I’m just so tired and tired of management being rude and not rewarding and threatening my job. I’m tired of miserable people being so disrespectful and rude over the phone.. ugh. Does anyone else that do collections go through this or has gone through this because I’m on my last straw I wanna quit so bad.",

People call in all the time claiming the reason why they’re behind on their bills are because they didn’t receive their bills, or they didn’t realize that they were late, or they were shocked stating they sent in a payment when they really hadn’t.     \n\nWhen you look into their accounts though you can’t help but see that they’ve been on payment arrangements since their account was open, and most of those arrangements defaulted.   Or when you offer them ways to email the bills to them they refuse saying they like it the way it is.     \n\nOr they complain that they sent in a payment through check and the check hadn’t arrived yet because it’s of course handled through the mail and people don’t want to learn how to make payments online or to set up auto pay or call us monthly.     \n\n\nThe thing is after taking so many calls every day and listening to everyone discuss their accounts, you realize that out of every call that is legitimately behind, it feels like there’s there’s at least 30-40% of these other accounts that have fallen behind due to taking advantage of the situation or just simply by their own doing of some sort.   \n\nMaybe I’m exaggerating by that percentage but I fee like there are still a high percentage of people that brought this on themselves knowing full well what they were doing.   I know that it’s my fellow coworkers and my job to be sympathetic towards everyone but there’s been many a time in which we’ve discussed calls in which the person on the other end of the line calling in for help stated that they still make a decent 5 to 6 figure salary while not paying their late bill.  It makes it hard to feel bad for some people.  \n\nHow do you not develop a sour attitude towards people who you know brought this upon themselves while they complain that we don’t help enough just because they want to take a small break from paying their bills and act like we should just turn a blind eye?",

I have been with my mentor for call training the last few days, and it has been horrible. From my understanding, they are supposed to help walk you through your first few calls. For my first day on the phones, I had 4 calls which were all over 40 minutes and all ended up being escalated to a different department. She was instructing me to tell the customer as little information as possible, even when it came to the customer simply asking for their subscription cost or the last charge on their account. For some reason, she said we can never answer questions with a yes or no and can’t give out any account information to them and even though they are verified, they have to tell us instead. No resolutions were ever made, and she would tell me to just escalate the call. She then would tell me not to mention to them that we took certain steps but to just say the customer doesn’t want to take our advice. \n\nI mentioned all of this to my trainer where he assured me that the mentor was very wrong and if this had been a regular day of calls, I probably would have been terminated. He said that he would find me someone more suitable for the next few days. However, when I showed up for work he said it would not be possible to get me a new mentor and asked me to just “tough it out.” So, I didn’t show up the next day. I feel like a jerk for not giving a notice, but I feel like if I stay, it will just be a mess considering I’m learning the opposite of what we are actually supposed to do.

We’ve shown that we’re not refusing to deal with the complaint, but are being more than accommodating. Meanwhile the customer has shown that they want special treatment, and are being overly accusatory.\n\nI know we’ve done nothing wrong, but the Ombudsman could side with the customer anyway, but this is just playing into our hands and making this less likely!",

I've had four call reviews and two of them were very good call reviews and the other two not so much. The last two involved me not documenting something properly so it's considered \"false documentation\" if we don't put the correct information in while documenting each customers case. I made a goof on both of those calls and didn't document certain things correctly because we have to follow a script for every call that comes in. \n\nIn training, they said if we get 3 of those we can be let go. I'm still very new to this company and it's very stressful at times because the company is fda regulated and any wrong documentation will go against us even if it was a mistake. I've gotten 2 red marks so far but I'm not sure if those really count  since I've only been on the floor for about a month now. Both times were complete mistakes and seemed like tricky situations on how to document such events. I'm honestly stressing about this because I feel getting two of those in under a month is making me think this job isn't the right fit for me and the customers can be really awful at times. The company is also hiring people like crazy because the queue times for our customers is up to an hour at times and my manager said they were hiring up to 70 people last time I asked. \n\nMaybe I should start looking for a new job but I've been told I have very good people skills on the call review, it's just the documentation and following the script is the tricky part because it's not very flexible. Am I worrying myself over nothing here? I just find it hard to be motivated when I'm getting feedback like this making me think I'm going to lose my job :/",

They had completely misunderstood basically everything about how the UK energy market works. Fair enough, they’re an immigrant. No judgemement, but if you're new to the country it can be easy t miss certain practical details. Hell, a lot of native folk misconstrue a lot of this stuff.\n\nOn checking the call, we’d explained everything, and asked them if they understood, which they gave us various affirmative answers for. So, if they’d not understood, it was through no fault of ours, our team went above and beyond.\n\nAs per our complaint procedure, I, as a senior manager, called the customer, walked them through everything and try and find a solution. So far so simple. They seemed to understand. They where very upset though that an estimated bill was, well, estimated. They thought it should be required to be within a certain percentage or something.\n\nThat’s not how it works. Prices are fixed, the bill is not. If they can’t tell us how much energy they use (they where new to the business so had no clue), we can only give a very rough estimate. They seemed to accept that, and the call ended.\n\nTwo months later, they emailed in complaining that we’d not dealt with the complaint. Apparently they’d forgotten my forty-odd minute call. On calling them back, they where livid. They don’t want to have a phone call, they want a *formal complaint*.\n\nI tried to explain that this *is* our formal complaint procedure, as stated on our web site. It complies with the regulator’s guidelines, the ombudsman scheme, the (voluntary) industry code of practice, the indevidual requirements of all the suppliers, etc. As we also exclusively work over the phone, this should not be controversial.\n\nI stress try, as they just kept talking over me that they wanted to deal with this in writing, and hung up on me. I thus got the pleasure of sending them a “please phone us” email, and attaching a PDF, the format of which is also complaint with the various requirements, which explained our formal complaint procedure.\n\nI’d love to see them escalate the complaint, as we have them on a call recording effectively refusing to go through the complaint procedure while also insisting they want to complain.\n\nAhhh, the insanity.",

Don't buy luxury items for children unless you can afford to replace them as if they are cheap? \n\n(Actual email, replacing worn underwear not showing signs of a manufacturing defect is not eligible for refund or replacement)\n\n-\"I haven't had these very long/only worn them a couple times and they have a hole!\"\n\nI check the order history and it stuns me that MOST of the time, not some of the time, but damn near every time, the underwear they want replaced is between 8 months to TWO YEARS old. \n\"They were expensive, I was hoping they would last longer\" \n\nLonger than what? The roman empire?\nTwo presidential terms?? \n\nIt's a subscription, not a lease agreement. \n\nAlways. Every day. It's been a year and I'm still flummoxed each time I get these emails. \n\nThey're not getting free underwear, but at least they have the audacity.",

        "text": "Oh, those wacky people that have gotten their hands on a stolen credit card and want to try it out!\n\nFirst story was from someone that had someone’s numbers but not the physical card.  They read off the number and I asked what type of card it was.\n\n“It’s a credit card!”\n\n“Well, yes, but what company issued the card?  What logo is on it?”\n\n“Oh, it’s a Visa Mastercard!”\n\nI was tempted to tell them we only accepted Discover American Express.  As anyone who works with charge cards knows, you can tell from the first digits who issues it, but I played dumb and would leave a note about it for our payment verification department, if necessary.  The number matched up with Visa, so I entered the code.\n\n“The expiration date?”\n\n“Um, er, oh, this card never expires!”\n\n“All cards expire.  Donald Trump’s card expires.  If you don’t have the expiration date, I cannot process the order.”  No order was placed for our good customer that day.\n\nOccasionally, kids would call in with a vague notion of how credit cards worked.  When I’d ask for the number, I’d sometimes get something like, “Seven two four eight zero one two three nine eight six seven five three oh nine… five… three?  Four?  Seven?”  and he’d keep going until I’d said he’d given me enough digits.  Obviously, it didn’t go through.  One young sir confidently gave me a card number that even contained letters.\n\nIt was common for a fraud order to have the perpetrator spell the name of the cardholder, rather than risk mispronouncing the name.  One memorable “customer” did not get the memo.\n\n“Last name of the cardholder, please?”\n\n“Um, Kill… uh. Kli… K… Kl… Ki… Kill, Klill… Kill, Killinger!”\n\n“How do you spell that, sir?”\n\n“K-L-I-N-G-E-R”.\n\nKeep in mind, this was about twenty years ago.\n\n“You must not watch M*A*S*H much, do you, sir?  That’s pronounced, ‘Klinger!’”\n\nTo his dubious credit, he hung in there and gave me the card info.  Our procedure was to attempt to process the order to get a record of it, even if it was obvious fraud.  Payment Verification would take care of canceling it.\n\n“I’m sorry, your card issuer is declining this charge.  Let me transfer you to our payment department for further assistance.”  Of course, he hung up as soon as I put him on hold.\n\nI got him back ten minutes later!\n\nHe didn’t recognize my voice, but proceeded to place an identical order, but this time the cardholder was something a bit easier, like Max Schultz.\n\n“I’m sorry, your card issuer is declining this charge.  Let me transfer you to our payment department for further assistance— or was the first time as Mr. Klinger good enough for you?”\n\n&lt;click&gt;",

        "text": "I say this because I was moved from my department from which I was at since the start of my employment here, too a department in which I hate doing from the beginning. It's the retention dept.  My God I hate the retention department so much. General customer service has 15-25 min of availability in -between calls, while retention has 1-2 min availability in between calls. I was force to move to retention due too my last day of me being on this job is next friday (12/9/22)  I gave them a two weeks notice because I \"cared\" about these people and there were like my \"family\" - I know, I shouldn't have thought like this. Your Co Workers are not your family. I get it. \n\nI'm a person who has never given a job a two week notice. Heck, the longest notice I ever gave was a 4 hour notice. I'm kicking myself in the butt due too if I would've shut my mouth and NOT tell my manager my last day, my manager would not have moved me to a department I really prefer not to do. I can't fight it and when i told my sup, \"I'll just quit right now\" Thankfully, my manager doesn't come in for a few hours later from when I start. That gave me 2 hours too breath and look at my bank account  to realize how broke I am right now. (Ha) I wanted to share this with y'all and see do you think it would benefit yourself if you gave the company you work for a\"proper\" two weeks notice? It doesn't. It only benefits the company and you will be screwed 100% of the time. I really wanna know, have y'all given a job a two weeks notice? If so, how did it work in the end? Do you wish you wouldn't have given the notice? Was doing \"the right thing\" worth it in the end or did the company hurt you from anyway to everyway. CALL CENTER MANAGERS/SUPS, do you care if your agent gives a two weeks notice or do you not care?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: First time in my career, I gave a company a proper two weeks notice.I got screwed in the end. Have you ever given a job a two weeks notice? Yes. No, Why? What was the outcome?",

I said “I’m trying to help you, please do not speak to me like that” and he actually stopped and apologized!! I think he felt bad because he ended up hanging up a few seconds later. Lol.

        "text": "I usually deal with angry customers pretty well. When someone is ranting about the company, I try my best to hear them out and help them as much as I can. \n\nBut today, one customer immediately started bellowing down the phone at me. I stayed calm and told him what I was going to do to resolve the issue with his account, but I just couldn't calm him down or lead him to any productive conversation. I told him I would need him to stop shouting and swearing so that I could continue to service the call. He got even more angry that I was 'refusing to help him'. After more of this, I told him that I was going to disconnect the call. He said (the magic words!), 'You're a little slag. F*cking c*nt.' I ended the call there.\n\nMy manager was supportive and kind. He listened to the call and reported the customer, who apparently has a history of insulting advisors. I just didn't realise how much a call like this would shake me- I've worked in customer service for years and no one has ever been that horrible to me, it's never gotten personal before. I went to the bathroom and cried. The rest of my day was better, and I'm grateful that my manager had my back. \n\nI just don't get it, honestly.",
