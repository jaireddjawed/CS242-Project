        "text": "Hi guys!! This is a repost from r/AskAnEngineer as that sub appears inactive. \n\nSo I'm very curious about one thing. In May of 2021, the Mexico City metro line 12 collapsed, specifically one of its overpasses that seems to have nor resisted the weight of the train and fell apart o to the traffic underneath. According to several reports, the most thorough being the New York Times investigation and the leaked DNV audit commissioned by the CDMX government, the line had issues since its inception and the shoddy construction created the condition for it to collapse in the way it did. \n\nWhat makes me very curious, is that the line mostly survived the 2017 Mexico City earthquake that damaged most of the city. Some of it was closed but only for a couple of days, it was operational very quickly after the earthquake. How can a structure survive an earthquake, only to fall apart just 4 years later under the weight of the train it carried a zillion times everyday? \n\nI'm guessing the force of an earthquake is not the same as wear and tear damage. But I'm so puzzled by this. If someone could help me understand better, that'd be great! \n\nReference on Wikipedia for some info: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Metro_overpass_collapse",

        "text": "Hi, I have an unusual question. I am building my second ROV (underwater drone), and I need to source CAT5/CAT6 cable to act as tether, which will be wound on a reel with a slip ring, and connected to a laptop on the topside. The requirements for the cable are:\n\n1. It just be as long as possible - for Ethernet, I believe that is 80-100 meters, depending on quality.\n2. Flexible - my ROV is small (340x220x200mm), so if the cable is too stiff, the ROV will have trouble maneuvering.\n3. Not too weak - it won't carry any significant loads, but if the ROV goes dead, I need to be able to pull it to the surface by the cable.\n4. Neutrally buoyant - neither sink nor float, regardless of water depth and pressure, up to a depth of 80 meters. If it is not, it will make it difficult for ROV to maneuver, and it will tend to snag on underwater obstacles. If anything, the cable can be VERY slightly buoyant. Extremely slightly.\n\nThe first 3 requirements are easily satisfied by most Ethernet cables on the market. The buoyancy requirement is difficult, because manufacturers don't specify cable density in their datasheets. Judging from my testing, some cables are too dense and sink, while others are too light and float, suggesting that there should be a cable out there that is just the right density - I just have to find it.\n\nI am aware that there are purpose-made ROV tethers, including Ethernet, but unfortunately this ROV is a hobby project and the funds are limited, while these tethers are extremely expensive. For comparison, regular Ethernet cable is 30-40€ for the length I need, while purpose-made ROV cable is 500-800€.\n\nNow, from what I gathered, the regular (round) Ethernet cables are either air-filled or gel-filled. Air-filled is no-go - as the ROV descends, the cable gets squished by water pressure, air gets compressed, and cable begins to sink. Or worse, water will get inside the cable. Gel-filled would be ok. I also noticed that flat (patch) cable tends to have neither air nor gel inside, because the cable jacket is compressed over the inside wires. So flat would work as well.\n\nBefore you suggest it, I did try adding floats (pieces of PU foam) on a sinking cable to balance it. It works, but cable snags on everything it possibly can - underwater debris, weeds, etc. Also, some fishes seem to confuse foam for a piece of bread. I also tried putting the cable inside a polyester rope - unfortunately, the rope only provides flotation because of air bubbles trapped between the strands, and as water pressure increases, these bubbles get squished, and the cable sinks again.\n\nSo, my issue is that I don't have info on the densities of various Ethernet cables. And I can't buy them all just for testing, especially because I have to order online due to limited local options. Very few sellers would sell samples of Ethernet cable, and when asked they haven't got the slightest clue if their cable sinks or floats.\n\nSo what I'm asking, can anyone from their experience let me know if you've seen an Ethernet cable that has neutral buoyancy in fresh water, and doesn't have air inside the jacket?",

        "text": "I’m currently in the process of designing my senior project for college. I’m making a tow rope type device for skiing and snowboarding which will be powered by a predator 212 or similar engine. I’m currently having a hard time knowing which type of transmission would be best for this system. \n\nMy original idea was to use a 2:1 reduction wet clutch gearbox (example: https://www.helmetkarts.com/products/wet-clutch-2-1-reduction-gearbox?variant=12652196823093) as these are smaller and seem fairly robust. Also has an additional gear reduction which is nice because it gets me closer to the gear reduction I would like. My only worry is that 1. They might not fit onto the predator 212. I’m having a hard time finding other people doing something similar online and finding spec sheets for these has been fairly difficult as they seem to vary in size and I cant afford to order something that doesn’t fit. 2. Every good option I see that MIGHT fit is from eBay and they tend to be around $200 which is fairly pricey. \n\nThis is what brings me to the torque converter. I originally dismissed these because they have a bigger footprint and I wanted to try something different from the norm. Also this device will be exposed to the elements and the torque converter seems more susceptible to failure due to snow and water in the belt system. The upside of these is they have a variable torque reduction which could be nice for varying loads on the system. They are also less than half the cost in most cases. \n\nWhat would you choose in this situation? Does anyone here have anyone with experience with these wet clutch gearboxes? Thank you!",

        "text": "So I wanted to create a hypothetical power grid that is capable of powering the average american household (30kwh a day) with a few rules.\n\n-No pre-made generators (repurposing motors or var alternators and such allowed)\n\n-No use of desiel allowed (I have no clue how desiel generators work but I think it's combustion and that's not allowed, like you can use steam to spin a turbine but if it involves spark plugs no no)\n\nI quickly realized this was stupid even without having any knowledge of how electrical generation works but pushed on. I now know what batteries to buy from what shady Chinese company to create a storage solution for 30 kilo watts and it'll only cost 3000 dollars. Still have no clue how to make the 1.5 kw generator, the ideal solution seems to be hydroelectric generation using a small stream and small dam. I have a vague idea of how turbine powered generators work but I probably actually don't because I'm stupid and I don't understand how one would scale such a thing up to create a kilo watt of power. I've looked around on the internet for a few hours now tryna see if anyone has attempted such a thing but no one has as Solar panels exist. Also reminding you I have no reason to want to know any of this.",

A friend of mine and I got into an argument over why a larger exhaust correlates to higher levels of horsepower in an engine. He is trying to say that it doesn't make sense since the amount of air would leave the engine at the same rate no matter the size of the exhaust. We got into a big argument of him saying the math doesn't work out.\n\nThe problem is I feel like intuitively what he is saying doesn't make sense. For one, we have real world data of engine producing higher horsepower with shorter/bigger exhausts. The second example I tried to use was a pool with a 2 inch hole vs a one inch hole at the bottom of it draining. He tried to say both would drain at the same pace. But I feel like we know from real world experience that isn't the case. We also tried to use the example of two different hoses being attached to a pump of the same strength. I tried to say that the pump with the bigger hose would move more water quickly, but the smaller one would move a smaller amount of water faster at the outlet but less water overall.\n\nThe problem is I don't know the math behind this or an equation to show him what I'm talking about. Am I just completely wrong? Is there a fluid equation I can see to show him with various inputs plugged in to explain why a larger outlet with equal amounts of force being applied to a fluid would let the larger outlet drain a larger volume than the smaller outlet? Does anything Im asking even make sense?",

I work full time on aircrafts for the Air Force Guard and have about 5 years’ experience with the avionics aka electronics department of the aircraft. I make $103K a year, but that’s attached to the requirement of me staying in the Air Guard, which is a requirement for the civilian job I have attached to my Air Guard membership. Being that I want to create opportunities out of the military service requirement, I want to obtain my electrical engineering degree so I can possibly obtain a job around $105K a year or more of course with that degree and experience combo. However, I was once told that an \"Electronics Systems Engineering Technology\" degree is different from an electronic engineering degree. I’ve attached my alternative school option, which is Arizona State University (ASU), as I assume that might be the \"better\" degree? They are both ABET-certified, though? Side note TESU would be completely free for me to attend meanwhile ASU online would cost me 50-100K I assume. I’m just looking for advice or input here on whether you folks think it’s the same degree or different, and is it that deep if it is different to change schools? I more than appreciate anyone's input, as I’m just trying to make the most of my opportunities here.\n\nTESU: Electronics Systems Engineering Technology\n\n[https://www.tesu.edu/ast/programs/bs/electronics-systems-engineering-technology](https://www.tesu.edu/ast/programs/bs/electronics-systems-engineering-technology)\n\nASU: Electrical Engineering, BSE\n\n[https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major/ASU00/ESEEEBSE/electrical-engineering](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major/ASU00/ESEEEBSE/electrical-engineering)",
