Aren't the states bound by the constitution? If not, why not? If yes, why does it allow child marriage (and all the other stuff)? \n\nWhen the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade I learned for the first time that apparently some laws are connected to court rulings... Is this something similar? And why do people (why does the state?) rely on such rulings not to be overturned if they're that essential and protect things as important as all that? \n\n\nTexas: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/11pccei/this_is_so_crazy_a_proposed_texas_law_that_will/\n\nArkansas: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/11oqwf6/child_labor_laws_repealed_in_arkansas/\n\nWest Virgina: https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/11mw2aa/child_marriage_ban_bill_defeated_in_west_virginia/\n\n(Hope this is the right context.

From what I’ve read is that Curtis “campaigned” for the award. I have can’t seem to understand what this means or why she would “campaign” for, what I think, is a non-major role in the movie. I’ve seen so much talk about Jamie Lee Curtis and Everything Everywhere All At Once but just can’t seem to understand what’s going on exactly.\n\nhttps://awardsradar.com/2023/03/11/on-the-controlled-chaos-of-the-best-supporting-actress-race/",
