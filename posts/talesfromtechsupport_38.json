        "text": "I'm an IT in the military and I have had some real doozies when it comes to managing my LAN. But I think this one takes the cake.\n\nThe day this particular fiasco takes place was kind of stressfully from the get go. We had lots of high importance evolutions taking place, some drills involving an application that one of my servers hosted. I arrived at work before most decent people are even awake and I checked my servers. My system is incredibly unforgiving to it's admins but over the past year I have become familiar with all the little kinks that make it run smoothly. \n\nI boot up the two servers and the VM's it's hosting and make sure all of their services start. I do some real basic network connectivity tests and I get on a user workstation and make sure I can access the app it hosts. Having satisfied myself, I grab a cup of coffee and start dealing with the usual helpdesk stuff. Unlocking accounts, resetting passwords, and fixing a printer for that one officer who swears technology hates her. \n\nFinally the drills start and I task my guys to handle the little stuff while I watch and make sure my system isn't blamed by the operators for some silly user mistake... Lo and behold the server is spitting registry errors when the operator tries to open the app. I'm baffled of course, and now the attention of five O-4's is focused on me. \n\nI know what causes this issue, my servers aren't talking to the LAN. I run down to my server room and check that they are still running. I find that the servers are running, the VM's are booted up and running, and yes I can ping between my two servers. I sit there and think... \n*What about the rest of the LAN?* I ping my domain controllers.\n\n\nDestination Host Unreachable.\n\nDestination Host Unreachable.\n\nDestination Host Unreachable.\n\n\n*Ahh... Okay I see now.* I ping the switch first. \n\n\nReply from (Switch): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\nReply from (Switch): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\nReply from (Switch): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\n*What? Okay hmm.* I run and grab my console laptop and port into the switch. I can see my interfaces between my servers are good. My interfaces between my switches are good. \n\n*Okay let's try this.* I ping my domain controllers from my switch.\n\n\nReply from (DC): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\nReply from (DC): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\nReply from (DC): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\n\n*I... What?* The phone in the server room starts to ring. I answer\n\n&gt;$Kraken: IT2 Kraken speaking.\n\n\n&gt;$Operator: Hey... Uhh they wanna know whats going on down there...\n\n\n&gt;$Kraken: I'm still troubleshooting, it might be a while.\n\n\n&gt;$Operator: (Begins speaking to someone in the room with him) Yeah they don't like that, they say you have 10 minutes.\n\n*Great.*\n\nI hang the phone up without saying anything else. I pull up a diagram of our LAN topology and start to think... Suddenly it clicks with me. I pull up my VLAN ports and see that the interface between my edge switch that connects one of my servers to the rest of the network is down. My configuration is kind of odd, my two servers have their own dedicated edge switch. So I have two servers, two edge switches, and they each connect to their own backbone switch. Edge switch number 1 is showing an UP/UP on it's interface to it's backbone switch. Edge switch number 2 is not showing UP/UP to it's backbone switch. \n\nThe reason it was able to ping the domain controller was because it has a connection to the other edge switch, so it can talk to the network just fine. But my server is on a specific VLAN and can't follow that path to the network. It has to follow the path that is down. \n\n*Great.* I immediately assume the worst case scenario. My fiber connection got cut or damaged somewhere and I'm going to have to run 300ft of fiber to my switch that is three stories up. I run to check my backbone switch, only to discover that the entire part of the building is closed for remodeling... I've never been one to let some tape and paper stop me from fixing my equipment though so I push through. The floor is entirely stripped up and I see swarms of contractors tearing up the floor. \n\nI can't physically access the room that has my switch. I back track and find the room directly below and discover this tiny escape scuttle that leads into the room above. I shimmy up the ladder, force the metal hatch up, and pull myself into the room. I see a few contractors walking around wrapping things in plastic before they paint the ceiling. I walk past them as they try to tell me the area is off limits and find my switch. \n\nHere is the problem. My switch is turned off... Not just the switch but the UPS feeding it. They turned the whole thing off...\n\n&gt;$Kraken: Uhh excuse me, why is this turned off?\n\n\n&gt;$Contractor: (Visibly angry that I ignored their efforts to get me out of the room) Because, we had to paint.\n\n\n&gt;$Kraken: So you walked into a military facility, saw a piece of equipment with a lot of cables coming out of it and thought it would be a good idea to... turn it off?\n\n\nI flip on the UPS, boot up the switches and climb back down the scuttle. I go into my server room, ping my domain controller from my server.\n\n\nReply from (DC): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\nReply from (DC): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\nReply from (DC): bytes=32 time=1ms\n\n\nI walk back into the room they are conducting the drills and have the operator open the app... The program launches immediately and they begin their drills without saying a word to me... I walk back into my shop, sit down at my desk and grab my coffee...\n\n&gt;$Coworker: Hey uhh, we are getting reports that *blah, blah, blah* is down and chief is saying that *blah, blah, blah...*\n\n\n&gt;$Kraken: Yeah... I'll deal with it.\n\nI hate Mondays. ",

        "text": "Hello friends! FTP, but I've lurked around the sub for a bit. Also, my apologies in advance for any formatting errors, as I'm still learning!\n\n\nNow, some pertinent background info about me and the situation. I am not in IT. I work as a manager in the food service industry, where our specific location has 4 computers: 3 that connect to monitors in our office, and 1 that connects to a monitor in our office as well as a larger system with 9 monitors across the location. This one is what our POS ordering/reporting software runs through. Additionally, we have various payment terminals and tablets set up for various things such as payment (duh), hours tracking, online ordering, etc, and a printer for all of our necessary daily reports, all of which require an internet connection. I also happen to be one of the most technologically challenged individuals known to man-kind, so apologies if my terminology isn't spot on. I've been trying to learn by reading subs such as this one, and would like to think I've made some improvement since being so inept I needed a walkthrough of my fruitphone when I switched over a few years back, haha! Our 24 hour IT support comes from one (very patient) gentleman up at our head office in another city several hours away. It's rare we have to escalate things to him, so he's just always on call unless on vacation. Now, onto the story!\n\n\nThe Cast\n\n$Me: pretty self explanatory here\n$HOIT: head office IT guy\n$SM: stubborn other manager\n\n\nWhile in the other morning, I noticed one of our payment terminals kept dropping signal. Super odd, as this specific terminal is used for only one thing, and as such, is the only terminal on premises that operates off of an actual, physical ethernet connection, as opposed to being a portable unit with a wireless connection. Called the help desk for the terminal (as it's the one type of equipment we use that comes with outside support), did the required troubleshooting, but it still dropped periodically even throughout the course of the phone call. They decided they'd send a tech out, likely within a few days, and I thought that was the end of that. As I mentioned, only used for one thing, so really not the end of the world to wait.\n\n\nThen one of our tablets went down. No wifi connection. Again, weird, but I did some fiddling around with it and managed to get the connection reestablished. Not 20 minutes later? Boom, *another* one of our tablets stops working. If you guessed lost connection, DING DING DING, you get a cookie! Same as last time, turned it off/on, did some fiddling around, managed to get things back up and running.\n\n\nNow, at that point I was sure something else had to be going on, but I was half an hour out from being done my shift, and like I said before, horribly technologically challenged. My relief ($SM) had more experience dealing with the tech side of things, so it's best I just update him on the situation, let him handle it so I don't break things, and go on my way. Or so I thought.\n\n\nI arrive to work the next morning, and what do I find? A note from $SM saying, \"Hey $Me, the internet went fully down last night. Don't worry, I got it all back up and running though.\"\n\n\nOh. And EVERY SINGLE ONE of our systems was down.\n\n\nSo I immediately call $HOIT, update him on what's happening, and the two of us get to work. Obviously I think something new has happened to cause this, as the note from $SM indicated things were back up, so this is what we're going off of. Weirdly enough, $HOIT is able to remote in to one of our office computers, but is somehow completely blocked out of all the others. He pulls up some window with what looks like code/info on the computer, and instructs me on how to do the same on another. We go through the list comparing things, until he notices something weird. The IPs don't match. As in, on the working computer, things are set to \"xxx.xxx.11.x\", and on the non-working computer, it's \"xxx.xxx.22.x\". Sure enough, every single piece of technology that's down is set to \"xxx.xxx.22.x\", even the printer!\n\n\n&gt;$HOIT: I thought you said everything was back up and running? Did you do anything before calling me? These are all on a completely different address, and they wouldn't do that on their own.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Absolutely not, with my track record, you know I don't touch tech things unless it's necessary or with some sort of guidance from someone who knows.\n\n\n&gt;$HOIT: Okay, well looks like we're going to have to reset these manually, because I can't access that address.\n\n\nSo we proceed to do that. Manually changing (him instructing me how) the IP addresses on everything that wasn't connecting, over to the \"xxx.xxx.11.x\" type address that was working. By the end of things, he was finally able to remote in and check everything else, and the internet connection was restored on everything. He also couldn't find anything else wrong, so we just chalked it up to an angry tech ghost (don't you hate those things), and went on our way. This whole process took way longer than it should have, largely in part I'll admit, to me just straight up not knowing what I was doing. Over 2 hours of fixing things, and we couldn't open our doors until things were fixed as these systems were necessary for business, so almost an hour of potential business/sales lost.\n\n\nA few hours later, again, shift change is coming up. And wouldn't you guess, the relief coming on? $SM. He wanders in, I grab him, recount everything that happened, and, trying to figure out the cause of the morning's problems, ask what the hell had happened the night before. Turns out, it was the end of the night when the internet went down. The only thing he had left to do was send his end of day emails. So what did he do? He, and I quote, *just fiddled around unplugging and plugging in the router and things and messing with settings until it worked*. Somehow, in this process, he had changed the IP address of the router, and also changed the address of one computer in the office (the only working one at the start), which then connected. He was then able to send off his emails, so he didn't bother checking literally anything else.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: So wait, you just did this all on your own? You knew there had been problems all day, then had a full outage of all of our systems, and just didn't call $HOIT? Or even check that things were back when you messed with things?\n\n\n&gt;$SM: **Why would I call IT? It works now, doesn't it?**\n\n\nIf looks could kill, my friends, he'd be deader than a doornail.",

I can fix most things using google until I run out of things to search.  I've actually run into google returning no results and it's just the most frustrating thing in the world.\n\nThis happened a few months ago, I was hanging out with one of my friends and he mentions his laptop's* sound wasn't working.  I thought it was probably something simple, like something being muted, so I offered to take a look.\n\nI run through everything that could be muted.  When I hover over the volume control it says \"No playback devices\".  This is definitely weird because a) it's a laptop with speakers and b) I tried it with my headphones (which work on my laptop, but not his).\n\nI do the obvious thing and run windows troubleshooter.  It says everything is operating 100%, but there's still no sound. I try rebooting.  Nothing works.\n\nBy now I'm really stumped, no idea what caused this.  I asked my friend if he had recently done any updates or downloaded any programs, he said no.  (I believe him; he's pretty good about most things).\n\nThe last thing I think to check is the drivers.  Open Device Manager, select the appropriate driver, and... there it is, no driver information.  Except it *claims* to have the latest version** when I try to update.  So I do an uninstall, \"Update\" again (installs the driver) then reboot.  Amazingly, volume works again.\n\nProblem solved.  Still no idea what happened to the driver in the first place though...\n\n*This was a two-in-one I helped him pick out, based on his budget ($300) and usage (mostly youtube or web browsing).\n\n**The version number it provided was actually the latest version",

        "text": "Two short tales about non-assistance that occurred yesterday.  Currently working for a multinational company, but, yet again, am the only IT person in the region supporting internal staff.\n\nMy first two tales:\n\n* [The Infiinite Loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7le690/the_infinite_loop/)\n\n* [Waiting for Authority](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7plrwr/waiting_for_authority/)\n\n**Tale 1**\n\nBackground: We have [these Targus docks](http://www.targus.com/au/usb-3-0-dual-video-smart-dock-dock110au) at each desk.  Network and external monitor are plugged into the dock, and external monitor and mouse are plugged into the monitor.\n\nMicrosoft and specific company related security software updates often cause the docks to not function properly, which requires re-installation of the drivers.\n\n$User: My second monitor isn't working at my desk.\n\n$Me: I'll be there in a moment.  I need to finish what I'm doing.\n\nFinishes what I'm doing and grabs USB stick with latest drivers drivers and heads to $User's desk.\n\nHalfway there (small office)...\n\n$User:1 it's OK, it's working now!\n\n$Me: Cool. *heads back to my room*.\n\n**Tale 2:**\n\n$User2 is at offiste/client location.  Sends me an e-mail with Subject line:  Blue Tooth Polycom\n\nReads: We can’t seem to get this Bluetooth capable polyform (sic) to work to think you can spare some time and come check it out. \n\nTechnically, I don't do off-site.  Offsite users come to the main office and see me for assistance.\n\nWe all know Tech Support is suppose to be omniscient and that we should already know all the required information, but for fun I reply back.\n\n$ME: Can you tell me what the exact issue is? Photos of any error messages?  Unit make and model?  What steps are you trying to set it up?\n\n$User2 replies back 15 minutes later:  Got it working.\n\n$Me: Internally. *Phew!*\n\nTL;DR: The tech aura works from afar.",

We order the cellphones and they are sent from the carrier directly to the user with a step by step guide for them to follow. And iPhones also walk you through the process pretty well too so its a simple process, but people well y'all know how that works. Also I am not IT but IT adjacent, because of the structure of the business, to answer the questions that will come from that let me talk to IT bit. Also he said he knew exactly how to set up the phone when he filled out the form to request a phone. \n\nAlso I've been in this position since early 2015 and I manage about 3,000 cellular accounts I across 7 carriers on 2 continents. I always have at least one person like this every couple days today I had 3 this was just the most bothersome\n\nI'm A, he is B. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nA: When you get the phone from apple send me your imei it is on the back of the apple box in the bottom right hand corner and your site and you id name\n\nB: Here's my site and id\n\nA: Okay, tomorrow, send me all that info in one email\nThe next day\n\nB: My phones not working why didn't you set it up and I have to recover my account from Apple.\n\nA: Recover your account or are you restoring the phone? \n\nB: Recovering. \n\nA: Okay , Well, you need to wait 2 weeks for Apple to investigate. \n\nB: No, I'm restoring. why didn't you restore it already?\n\nA: What is it doing when you try to restore?\n\nB: it sends a code to my broken phone. \n\nA: Okay, it sounds like your rescue number is set to your cell phone number. You need to log into Apple and change your rescue number to one that's not your apple device. \n\nB: I already did that! It's not changed yet, why won't you finish the change! \n\nA: Well, You need to wait for the change to happen then. \n\nB: Why won't you finish the set up!? \n\nA: I need some information before you can do the set up. Have you sent me you IMEI your site and your id? \n\nB: I sent it yesterday day! \n\nA: The email you sent yesterday just has your site code and your id. I need your IMEI, it is on the back of the apple box below the UPC. \n\nB: I sent it yesterday! \n\nA: You couldn't have sent it yesterday, you didn't have the new phone yet, please send me that number and we can get you started. \n\nB: I just sent it. (receives his email with the same stuff) \n\nA: That email only has your site code and ID. Can you tell me the IMEI? \n\nB: I just sent it to you again! (receives same email) \n\nA: The email you just sent, again, does not have your IMEI. \n\nB: I am sending it again! \n\nA: Again, that is just your site code and your id name. \n\nB: Why can't I send it over skype?\n\nA: You can, I just need the number so I can put you on the server. \n\nB: Okay here it is (Id name) (site code 1). \n\nA: Okay and the Imei from the back of the apple box in the bottom right hand side below the upc\n\nB: I sent it (receives email with with ID name and site code) \n\nA: I'm sorry I'm still not seeing it please send it one more time.\n\nB: Fine I just emailed it to you (receives email with Imei finally) \n\nA: Thanks, that exactly what I need I'll get you added... When I try to add you it says site code mismatch, any idea what your site could be since its not that?\n\nB: Try (site code 2) this one it's the one I am at. \n\nA: Same error, mismatch. \n\nB: What's that mean? \n\nA: It means that is the wrong site code. \n\nB: Okay try (site 3). \n\nA: Is this the site you are assigned to?\n\nB: It's the site I was at the other day. \n\nA: Site mismatch, which site are you assigned to?\n\nB: Well I'm assigned here, (site 4) but I'm supposed to be assigned here (site 5). \n\nA: Okay I'm not Administrator to either of those sites as they are 2 different segments you said you were being transferred to this segment.\n\nB: I am part of this segment now! \n\nA: I'll reach out to IT to have them add you... IT can't add you, you need to reach out to HR and have them put you on the correct site. ill reach out to the person that is the administrator for the other site and have them add you to the system in the mean time....she is out of the office, we will have to wait till tomorrow to get you on the server\n\nB: this is rediculous!

They're notorious for enforcing time points.\n\nYesterday, I received an email from a site using one of our systems:\n\n&gt; Leah: The clock on the laptop doesn't match the atomic clocks in our rooms.\n\nWell, I doubt she has an *actual* atomic clock in each of her hospital's treatment rooms, but I understand she meant a clock that automatically sets itself to some standard time server.\n\nI TeamViewered into the computer, and confirmed that the time displayed on our laptop matched the time on my laptop, which agreed with Time.gov. I checked to make sure that Windows time service is running, automatically correcting the time per our standards, etc.\n\nAfter some cell phone troubles, I finally got ahold of Leah:\n\n&gt; Me: Hey, it looks like the time on the computer is accurate. Can you tell me how far out of sync it is with the room clocks?\n\n&gt; Leah: Yeah, your computer is 2:37 behind. I have to adjust every data point by 2.5 minutes because your computer is two minutes behind.\n\n&gt; Me: OK, what time does it say on your clock right now?\n\n&gt; Leah: It says 12:50.\n\n&gt; Me: OK, I think that's the problem: it's currently 12:47. Do you see the time.gov webpage on the screen? That's the actual time according to NIST, the government entity that keeps official time.\n\n&gt; Leah: Well, the atomic clock in my room says it's 12:50. Atomic clocks are never wrong.\n\n&gt; Me: OK, will you do me a favor? Will you look at your clock and tell me what symbols you see?\n\n&gt; Leah: Yeah, there's a battery icon, there's a wifi signal that's crossed out, there's a 24 hr icon---\n\n&gt; Me: Wait, tell me more about the wifi signal. It's crossed out?\n\n&gt; Leah: Yeah, it has a circle with a slash over it, like no smoking.\n\n&gt; Me: Just a guess - are you in the center of a very large hospital building?\n\n&gt; Leah: Yeah, pretty much in the center.\n\n&gt; Me: And you said your cell phone *never worked* in the building, and wifi signal was poor, too?\n\n&gt; Leah: Yeah, it's a really old stone building. We're in the basement.\n\n&gt; Me: Well, your clock just gets a radio signal telling it what time it is. That radio signal doesn't reach this clock which is why it's out of sync.\n\n&gt; Leah: That's not possible. I set it from my wrist watch myself! It's an atomic clock!\n\nTL;DR: Research hospital spends tons of money putting \"atomic\" clocks in each hospital room... to discover they can't sync over radio in the basement. So, nurse decides to manually set it from her wristwatch, then is surprised it's less accurate than the government organization whose job it is to keep time to the *ten-millionth of a second*.",

Everything is $$$$ed and I'm in a meeting, fix it!\n\n&gt; $Me: 5 minutes boss.\n\n&gt; $MD: Hurry!\n\nNow I am really starting to stress, $MD is technical and wouldn't be flapping if it was something simple, He would have just fixed it.\n\nArrive back at the office, slip into the server room without being noticed, see switch going beserk with traffic on all ports. Log into $server, pings are all over the place, internal latency going from 1ms to 500ms+.\n\n~~start to cry~~ being calm and thoughtful troubleshooting:\n\n* test another pc - sames\n\n* reboot switch - no dice\n\n* test wifi - no dice\n\n* check logs on $cloudmanagedswitch which sits on my desk as a dev network, see signs of a network loop\n\nthere was no reason for there to be a loop, nothing has changed.\n\n* finally head into the main office and get accosted by various staff members reporting \"its broke\"\n\n* investigate further, pin down affected switch port and unplug.\n\n* network recovers - **HERO STATUS**\n\n* discover port is patched to MD's PC\n\n\nNothing unusual here, but MD also has WIFI in his PC (didn't have cables at last building) which is also connected\n\n* Log into $MDs pc as $Me\n\n* Start ~~poking around~~ Investigating\n\n* Discover $someone has bridged wired and wireless network adapter\n\n* Swear profusely and loudly\n\nAfter the meeting, quick discussion with $MD ends with this gem:\n&gt; $MD: I thought that bridging them would make it quicker, because it joins the 2 connections together.\n\nNever had this kind of issue when I did external support...\n\n**TL;DR** \nMy MD decided he could get faster network access by bridging his wifi and ethernet connection, causing a network loop while I (tech) was out of the office\n\nLittle shoutout to James - I know you see this, good luck with the new job!\n\nEdit: line breaks",

Funny find I came across at work. \n\nThe company I work for has several locations, and only 5 desktop support techs, then 2 network techs (I am one, previously was a desktop support tech.) We've also recently updated our ticketing system, and it's a huge overhaul and needed a lot more training than previous versions (to which I held a 1 hour training, as well as provided a 20+ page document on using the system.) \n\nI'm sent out to cover partially at a location while that assigned tech is out on an unexpected medical leave, no problem I'm always willing to assist, even if I don't particularly enjoy this tech (less than knowledgeable for his \"experience\" he boasts. Putting paper in a printer is hard am I right?) \n\nI get set up, and try to figure out the flow that this particular tech has set up to manage his day to day at this location, I notice for a certain task he creates a ticket with his name as the customer. I'm *assuming* it's so he can just run a report on his name and see all the tickets of this type, versus running a report on that category &amp; site, so I follow his standard. Create a ticket with him as customer, copy and paste the template he uses for each of these style tickets, then proceed to resolve said ticket. Think nothing of it. \n\nA while later I check the queue and see a new ticket in his name as the customer, thinking I didn't close the ticket just imagined I did, I click on it. It's titled as **Automatic Reply: Incident # reported by you has been resolved**\n\nThat's when I realize our new ticketing system accepts email responses to the generated email, and creates a new ticket from said response. That tech has his out of office reply on and I'm currently stuck in a dilemma of let this ticket sit for month or more while they're out; or close the new ticket which results in a new ticket being opened, close said ticket etc. That would easily boost my number of tickets closed! \n\nIn the meantime I've alerted supervisors on this particular ticket they got a good laugh, as well as the person managing our ticketing system.

        "text": "Not my own tale, but that of a co-worker. It happened yesterday, while we were both at work as 1L IT-support at $hospital.\n\nContext: Due to the nature of our workplace (hospital) it is required that, especially on certain wards, the equipment (including computers, laptops, ...) is desinfected on regular bases. The method of disinfection varies periodically, depending on changing guidelines from management, as well as the products on offer by our suppliers.  \nRecently, the medical wards have come to disinfect IT-equipment with a certain kind of wet-wipes. Needless to say, water and certain electrical appliances don't mix and when the medical staff doesn't wring the wipes out before applying them, there is some accidental water damage to some (non-medical grade, non-washable) computer equipment.\n\nLong story short, removing my opinion on the matter and ignoring the myriad of water-damage-related cases we have to open with **$TwoLetterComputerCompany**, which is our main supplier for both desktops and laptops, I'll skip ahead to yesterday's happenings, where **$co-worker** had to call **$TwoLetterComputerCompany** (represented by **$helpdesk**) to have a tech come over for a repair under warranty to one of our laptops.\n\n&gt; **$co-worker**: -introduction, customer identification, laptop serial number, confirmation of warranty, etc.-  \n&gt; **$helpdesk**: What seems to be the issue?  \n&gt; **$co-worker**: The laptop has taken water-damage due to use of disinfecting wet-wipes. You'll notice in my ticket history we've logged several cases such as this in the past months. Due to this water-damage, the keyboard has given out. Typing is still possible with a USB-keyboard, so we can probably rule out damage to the motherboard. Seeing how water-damage is covered under our accidental damage warranty, can you send over a tech for an on-site repair, please?  \n&gt; **$helpdesk**: I'm very sorry to hear that, sir. Is it the entire keyboard that has given out, or just some keys?  \n&gt; **$co-worker**: Several keys, but I don't see how this is relevant... This is water-damage. The laptop is still wet. The keyboard needs to be replaced by your tech, as is said in the warranty.  \n&gt; **$helpdesk**: I understand, sir. I am however required to ask you to perform some actions before I can send a tech.  \n&gt; **$co-worker**: Look --  \n&gt; **$helpdesk**: Have you tried updating the BIOS?  \n&gt; **$co-worker**: It's waterdamage, as I said. I don't think that will help.  \n&gt; **$helpdesk**: Can you please update the BIOS, sir? It has shown in several cases in the past that this solves keyboard-issues with our laptops.  \n&gt; **$co-worker**: This is __waterdamage__. If I tilt the laptop in the right angle I can probably get water out of it. No amount of updates is going to fix this. We need a tech.  \n&gt; **$helpdesk**: I'm still going to have to ask you to update the BIOS, sir.  \n&gt; **$co-worker**: Dude.  \n\nThis went on for a few minutes more. In the end we \"updated the BIOS\" and \"noticed it didn't work\". A tech was sent out and repaired the laptop in five minutes after arrival.\n\ntl;dr - Laptop sustained waterdamage, $TwoLetterComputerCompanyHelpdesk cannot be swayed to believe this issue can't be resolved by updating the BIOS.\n\nEDIT: Formatting.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, here we go.\n\nA bit of backstory first, $artixerix works as kinda-IT-but-not-really in a family company after the regular guy left. And boss, seeing that he knows something about computers from his self-taught experience, left him in charge of website, server with SQL database, and all the other things...without caring if he has experience with this sort of thing. Computer is a computer, $artixerix should be able to fix it! Of course, he didn't get filled in on how any of this stuff was set up, or had any configs other than \"general tips\". Oh, and there's a sister company in another town that uses remote desktop to do their work on our server too.\n\nFast-forward to today. $artixerix happily walks into his workplace, expecting a happy day and a mug full of coffee, but what he sees is dark ages. People going all over the place, the horror, and shouts. You'd think that some kind of plague came by but no!\n\n&gt;$coworkers: Internet is down.\n\nAt this point, $artixerix is not sure what is worse - the message itself, or the fact that every single person he sees on his way to his desk tells him that. Or maybe the fact that one failure stops two companies from working, but right now he wishes he didn't get up. Because he has to go to **THE SERVER ROOM^ohgodpleaseno...**\n\nThat causes him a heart attack before he even has his morning coffee.\n\nThe server room consists of small room that barely has any kind of airflow, the cables are a mess, /r/TechSupportGore would run away in shame seeing that. Nothing was labelled by previous IT who set everything up, except one single cable - **INTERNET**.\n\nWalking into the server room, $artixerix is welcomed by the blast of heat that puts  Mt. Doom to shame, but somehow the very same server has been able to keep up working for the past 9 years, together with an external USB HDD for database backup and two switches *shoved* into the server rack, together with a mid-sized tower that nobody knows what it does yet nobody dares to turn it off^neither it is plugged to anything other than power...\n\nAnyway, our brave hero sits down in front of the rack and reaches out his hand to the depths, trying to fetch the router. He grabs it on the second try. Pulling it back, he notices a mess of cables it drags behind itself.\n\nHe never touched it, nor messed with it outside of logging onto it via browser to forward ports. It's his first time seeing such a monstrosity. A tired Cisco router that's been unsupported for quite a bit, handling four connections. There were two more ethernet cables hanging, unlabelled and without any sign of what they might be used for.\n\n&gt;$artixerix: Good fsck-ing job, previous guy...good job.\n\nAt least, that's what he thought to himself as he tried to sort out this mess. As he delves deeper, he notices the second router that was shoved in there, running but without any cables plugged. Then the voices of previous IT echoed in his mind:\n\n&gt;$previousIT: If that **** fries, just plug everything to the other one!\n\nWith that hint in mind, he proceeded to do it. But something catches his mind, as one cable seems weird...He plugs it into one port and it does nothing, but plugging the other one makes suddenly both light up like christmas trees! So, with newly gained information, he decides to unplug and un-tangle it from the mess that was in there. As he reaches the end of this puzzle, his face freezes with a realization.\n\n&gt;$artixerix: That connection was a loop. That idiot plugged one cable to both ports and left it...\n\nIt would explain a lot of issues in the past. More than he can count. He removes the culprit and plugs everything else, then goes back to check if everything works.\n\nWhole network comes back to life. Packets stopped randomly playing ping-pong. Sister comapny calls saying they can connect. Princess is saved, kissing our hero...at least that's what he imagines, as he is brutally woken up by a coworker barging into the server room yelling that everything works.\n\nAnd thus, the tale ends. It's 8:30 in the morning. $artixerix makes coffee and hopes that nothing else happens to the kingdom on his watch...\n\n\nTL;DR: Previous IT left a short ethernet cable plugged to two router ports, making a loop that sometimes caused issues, but went unnoticed until router broke.\n\nEDIT: formatting",

Our crew was transferred to some 2nd WW time barracks (with some furniture from the 1970 Olympics .. they were not used regularly).   So we spent 2 weeks to throw LAN cables and set up switches etc.\n\n There was only one little problem: No power in the rafters and no cabling tubes etc.\n\n So our setup looked a bit shitty with Lan cables coming from the celling instead out of nice cable channels.  And the power for the switches came from normal outlets going up into the rafters. Not nice but workable. We also tried to make everything nice with nailing down the cables etc .. unfortunately 2nd WW bunker concrete doesn’t hold normal cable nails, so in the end we just used the usual military tape.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n*After a while we had a building inspector showing up. He walked through the barracks and then he complained to our skipper, that everything was not up to building codes. *\n\nSo our skipper summoned all of us.\n\n\n$Skipper:” So we have here $BI with some problems ..”\n\n\n$ME:” What is the matter ?”\n\n\n$BI: “ Well all these cables are not up to standard. You should have got an electrician from central base management to install proper IT-cables” \n\n\n$Skipper:” Well these barracks are scheduled to be torn down and we wouldn’t get budget…”\n\n\n$BI:” Well that is not my problem .. these cables are done without proper knowledge”\n\n\n$ME: “What does proper knowledge mean ?”\n\n\n$BI:”Well it has to be done by a certified professional …”\n\n\n$ME:”That would be ?”\n\n\n$BI”: Well normally you would have a certified electrician, or meister and a engineer could certify it”\n\n\n  (Side info: Germany has 3 Levels of professional certifications : \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany#Apprenticeship ) \n\n$Skipper:” Who did the work ?”\n\n\n$Me: “ Well we did it …”\n\n\n$IM:” Well grunt, as far as I remember every specialist has to have a job training .. what was yours ?”\n\n\n$Grunt:”Well Sir, I’m a certified electrical Geselle” \n\n\n$ME:” Well $IM, as far as I remember every NCO does need to have his Meister ? What is your field of expertise ?”\n\n\n$IM:” Well I have a Meister for Flight Electronics of the former NVA, and with the German reunification I had to do my Electrical Meister to qualify for the reunited Navy”\n\n\n$Skipper:”As far as I remember every officer has to have some academic training.. $ME what was your qualifications …”\n\n\n$ME:”Well I’m a trained comms officer with special training for military communication cable networks. I also studied power generation as a engineer  and am qualified with the german power regulation ministry to certify power nets up to 10KV “\n\n\n$Skipper:” You see $BI all work was done by a professional, supervised by a qualified Meister and can be certified by a qualified engineer to be Sach- and Fachgerecht and up to all necessary DIN codes. Looking good is not in the code.” \n\n",

        "text": "There’s tech support in being an electrician ^right?\n\nSo... I used to be an Electrician.  I worked for $Crap Construction, where the lower quality materials used the better, promises are broken, OSHA is only followed when the inspectors are around, and the boss doesn’t care as long as it works in the end.\n\nWhy did I work for $CC you ask?  Because I was young, dumb, and desperate for work.\n\nAnyway, when I was fairly new PFY *(Pimply Faced Youth for the uninitiated)*, I had a mentor, named $Bob.  He was a hard worker, very knowledgeable, and a decent teacher.  He would also occasionally get a bit impatient and let his temper get the best of him.  His face would turn as red as a tomato, he’d clench his teeth (looking a bit constipated), and his normally comprehensible accent would slip into a deep southern drawl that sort of sounds like he stuffed his cheeks full of peanut butter.\n \nAnyway, I did like $Bob, but when he would get himself riled up I learned to avoid him till he cooled off.\n\nAnyway, Bob and I are working in the same room, him on a ladder and me wiring up outlet receptacles.  All but one light is working, and Bob is trying to rewire the connection as clearly one of our incompetent co-workers did it wrong the first time.\n\n**Note:** It is ~~perfectly~~ safe to work on live wires if you work slowly, carefully, use the right tools, and Most Important make sure you aren’t grounded to anything.  Personally I prefer just cutting the circuit, doing my job without worrying about surprise electroshock therapy, and then cutting it back on to see if everything worked.  Rob however was too impatient to do the whole off/on thing, and was working it live…\n\n&gt; $Bob: *$#*(%$\n\n&gt; $Morphuess: You ok over there Bob?\n\n&gt; $Bob: Yes!  This &amp;%*# circuit is wired wrong and I shocked myself.\n\n&gt; $Morphuess: It is just a love nip!  You want me to cut the circuit for you?\n\n&gt; $Bob: No!  I got it!\n\nI shrug and get back to work.  I can tell he’s already working himself up and telling him he’d finish it faster by cutting the circuit would just turn his wrath on me.  It is quiet, but interspersed every minute or so by another by another round of cursing as Bob, working in the cramped suspended ceiling surrounded by water pipes, AC ducts, and a false ceiling zaps himself again and again.  After several more love bites that aren’t reciprocated, Bob’s finally had enough.\n\n&gt; $Bob: God *#$%# this (*$%# circuit!\n\nHe comes storming down the ladder.  His cheeks were so rosy, so merry… or so angry.  He had a twinkle in his eye, or was that a glint of murderous rage?  He charges off into the electrical room two rooms over and presumably turns off the circuit he wasted the last 15 minutes working on.  He pounds back up the ladder and I turn back to my work, hoping that his wrath will be slated by the stubborn box of wire.\n\nHowever, my inner contemplation is interrupted by the most peculiar sound.  It was a high pitched continuous sound, but it sounded organic, not artificial.  It took me a second to realize that Bob was getting his ass fried by Benjamin Franklin’s discovery and was screaming thru clenched teeth.  I rushed over to pull him off the ladder, but before I got there his legs collapsed under him and he was jerked free of the loving embrace of 120V.\n\nThe sound coming out of his mouth had changed from a scream to a continuous stream of deep southern explicatives.  They were loud, varied, and impressively creative.\n\nHe refused first aid and elected to ~~curl into a fetal position~~ lay on a comfortable bag of insulation for about an hour before finally getting up and getting back to work.  Other than being a bit rattled he was fine, and back to normal the next day.\n\n**So how did it happen?** *Inquiring minds want to know!*\n\nKnowing the electricity was off, Bob grabbed the wires with his bare sweaty hands.  Unfortunately for him, they were quite live, and his sweat soaked back was pressed up tight against the metal A/C Duct in the confined space above the suspended ceiling.  He made a near perfect circuit thru his arms and out his back.  I could imagine him lighting up like in those Loony Toon cartoons where you can see his skeleton thru his skin.\n\nHowever, Bob was experienced enough to not accidentally turn off the wrong numbered circuit.  But here is where two other errors led to Bob getting quite a bit more “love” than he could handle.\n\nThe building we were working on was a large renovation, and in its many previous years had grown a variety of ~~shoddy~~ circuit panels.\n\nSome panels were numbered down like this\n\n&gt; 1\t6\n\n&gt; 2\t7\n\n&gt; 3\t8\n\n&gt; 4\t9\n\n&gt; 5\t10\n\nWhile for others the numbers went across like this\n\n&gt; 1\t2\n\n&gt; 3\t4\n\n&gt; 5\t6\n\n&gt; 7\t8\n\n&gt; 9\t10\n\nUnfortunately for Bob, some other PFY ~~it wasn’t me I swear!~~ had unknowingly labeled the panel as being numbered down instead of across…. Which leads to error #2.\n\nMy very first day on the job, Bob pulls me aside and says:\n\n&gt; $Bob: Morphuess, electricity can be dangerous, but you can be completely safe if you always, always check to see if a circuit you are going to work on is live.  And then he handed me a non-contact voltage detector (*google it!*)\n\nIn his rage and impatience, Bob didn’t take the extra 5 seconds it would take to verify that his circuit was dead.\n\nRespect electricity, and she will ~~mostly~~ respect you right back, for when her proper offering isn’t given, she will strike you down like the gods above.\n\n\n**TL&amp;DR**\n\n*Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows.  Manatees spend approximately 50% of the day sleeping submerged, surfacing for air regularly at intervals of less than 20 minutes, while spending seven hours a day grazing up to 15% of their mass.*",

Typically the clients will ask us how this works, especially when scanning a passport as the printer's scanner grid won't detect a suitable scan size. A client had completely disregarded the instructions posted beside the printer and placed their passport into the copier. \n\n\nThe passport then got stuck, and I was summoned to the rescue. Another Service Desk tech overheard what happened and also came over as he was in disbelief. Eventually, the passport was freed from the death-grip of the copier's feeder after pushing and pulling the ends of the passport. \n\n\nTLDR: Don't place your passport through a printer's copier. Bad things will happen and you will be silently judged/ridiculed!",

User describes the standard issues one sees with a semi-compatible charger with the wrong voltage.  \nAnd one throwaway line near the end:\n&gt;Also I noticed smoke coming from the charging port and immediately unplugged it.  \n\n___\nWe've been working on taking an inherited slapdash application hosting solution and making it more usable (and legal.) I did the VPN setup, $Cable did the VM magic, and $Lemonade did the server configuration. We finally have a working prototype.  \nNaturally, $Lemonade decided to announce this to the rest of the team in a spectacular release-notes email. Posted in redacted form below.\n  \n\n&gt;$Application 2.0  \nWe have released a second server for $Application. This new server actually will make use of license keys that were bought and doesn’t require questionable “modifications” on computers to join the server. This new server is currently live. The original $Application will be soon decommissioned. Guilds currently on that server have been notified. All Guilds are welcome to place an application but must meet the following requirements:\n\n&gt;•\tGuild’s current $Application must be version 3.1416 or later. Guilds currently on $Application 1.0 already meet this requirement and will have their Guild Hall transitioned automatically if they so choose.  \n•\tGuilds must supply their own license. $PunnyVendorName is currently out of licenses. We sent a carrier pigeon asking for when a mule would be by to restock their supplies but assume pigeon was struck mid-flight as we have not heard back from $PunnyVendorName  \n•\tGuilds with an alliance to the $MainCompany Guild that are interested in subscribing to the new $Application must contact $MainCompany's $PointOfContact.  \n•\tAll other Guilds must contact and be approved by $TheAncientOne prior to being granted admittance to the new server.  \n\n&gt;Guild Application  \nThe new server was designed for a capacity of [42] guilds. Preference to Guild admittance is as follows:  \n\n&gt;•\tGuild was personally invited by $TheAncientOne  \n•\tGuild is currently on the 1.0 version of the server and has elected to migrate their Guild Hall  \n•\tGuild is Introduced to us by $PointOfContact  \n•\tGuilds has a subscription us (P2P aka “Supported Clients”)  \n•\tAll other Guilds (F2P aka “Unsupported Clients”)  \n\n&gt;Due to the potential number of guilds applying the approximate wait time for P2P and F2P Guilds is roughly 1 month. Guilds without a 3.1416 client version are potentially at a longer wait if they elect to wait on the $PunnyVendorName.  \n\n&gt;Server Mods  \nUnlike the previous server, we are allowing all players to join the Mod team for the new server. However, players must meet the following proficiencies:  \n\n&gt;•\t$VMHostPlatform  \n•\t$OSPlatform  \n•\tVPN  \n\n&gt;Currently, the only approved players to mod the new server are the Wizard (aka $Lemonade), $Cable, and $Extensiondenied. Please see any of them if you are interested in joining the Mod team for the new server. They are also available as Skill Mentors if you are interested in joining the Mod team but are not proficient in the above skills. Note that the maintenance for the server is currently in Beta and no formal documentation has been published.  \n\nAmusingly, $TheAncientOne stopped by on the way to a meeting and commented that the patch notes email was \"great!\" Under further questioning he admitted he hadn't read it but was sure it was great.",

        "text": "Get ready for a long tale, one that was made way more complicated than it needed to be, and thrown in the wrong hands. I'll try to summarize what I can and provide the necessary detail. On a Thursday afternoon, I get copied on an email from my director about an issue that's been going on at a satellite campus almost all semester, him stating that I will look into it. Normally my bosses let me know before this type of thing happens, so I was a bit thrown back. I respond to my director and supervisor individually, letting them know my concern of my workload and that taking on a high priority would throw off the other projects I was on, that they also considered a high priority.\n\nMy supervisor then met with me Friday morning, and told me the director took that as me saying \"I don't want to do this assignment.\" I explained that wasn't the case, I was just concerned because it meant pushing back work that was already pushed back previously, and it didn't make sense to reassign my work, when the incident in question could be assigned to somebody else. Regardless, I once again pushed back my work I had planned for that day and reached out to the campus.\n\nThe incident turned out to be something that kept happening on computers utilizing a video conferencing software, that allowed students to join classes remotely, and not have to physically be on campus to join class. This was integrated recently to increase enrollment, which is great, but we've also had an influx of support requests for it when it doesn't work right.\n\nThere was an echo with the equipment they were using, and they were constantly having to change settings in order to get it working right. Sound was also coming out of the projector and wasn't sounding clear. It inconvenienced students and was just a pain. I figured it would be fairly simple to fix, I'd allow the computer to make changes, tweak some settings (I even had a document from our media department on how this was fixed in other classrooms), then run a test. I did all of that, tested with the campus, and thought it was fine. We do a restart and they want to test one more time to ensure there won't be any issues. I agree, we run through the test, and there's an echo. I go and double-check the settings, and somehow they changed back. After some extensive testing, I'm finding that these settings are not sticking upon reboot, even with the software disabled that would wipe any settings changed. I'm constantly telling them to unplug and plug the camera/mic kit back in, and I start to understand their frustration. It was defaulting back to the projector as the speaker, not the kit.\n\nI can't get anywhere with it, so I figured that it's the older Windows 7 image on the computer that's causing this to happen (this PC was two images behind our standard, our remote campuses tend to be that way). I build a new PC for them with our standard lab image on it, with Windows 10 (the problem classrooms I mentioned earlier were all on Windows 10), I borrow a kit from the Media Center to test it and it's working. A coworker offers to drive 45 minutes to install it, as it's close to home. I send the spare kit with him to rule out the possibility of their kit having problems. He does send, and a couple of hours later, I get an invite to join their conference call. It turns out that despite the testing done on my end, they are now having the same issue. So it's isolated to the classroom, so what could it be?\n\nA director from Online Learning (the department that handles the remote class program) along with the campus rep are fuming at this point, because they had already been experiencing this for a couple of months with little to no response from IT, and now we've tried almost everything and don't know what else to do. My director calls an emergency conference call the next day between Desktop Support (my team), our Build Team (who creates our images), and Media Services (MS), who supports most of the conference requests unless it's a desktop hardware/software issue.\n\nI get on the call as soon as I get in the next morning, with $Coworker on site, and the Director of Assistant Director of Media Services ($DoMS, &amp; ADoMS) running through basic questions with the campus. This includes asking them how the computer interfaces with the projector. Remember when I said sound was coming out of the projector? They discovered power, VGA, USB 2, and auxiliary but with nothing on the other end of it.\n\n&gt;$DoMS: \"USB 2 doesn't carry sound, so surely that can't be causing the problem.\"\n\n&gt;$ADoMS: \"Actually, it does. That's the only logical explanation as to why they're getting sound with no aux into the computer.\"\n\nSo we unplug the USB...and the video's gone now. We run the test without it displaying on the projector, and of course it doesn't default the sound to the projector anymore because it doesn't see it. But they needed to project, so they plugged the USB back in and the problems came back. So then MS walks $Coworker through tracing the VGA cable to the wall plate, then checking the other end of the wall plate, only to discover no VGA cable inside. Could the cable have been cut? $Coworker offers to climb up inside the ceiling check, but our supervisor has to tell him to stop because he's a contractor and our work's insurance can't cover him if he gets injured. At that point, it's up to MS to have their vendor go onsite and fix everything. This whole conference call has taken almost 3 hours (I get in at 9 and take lunch at noon), so I'm ready to de-stress and get something to eat, then move onto the next thing afterwards hopefully.\n\nThe vendor did go out and replace the broken video/aux cable, and we verified that they had no more problems after that. Oh, and I briefly mentioned this story in my last [tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7sxyzn/some_users_will_always_have_an_issue/). The morning of the emergency conference call I had a meeting with a faculty member who got pretty upset that I was continually canceling on him. I called and emailed him right before the conference to let him know, apologizing for the inconvenience, and to talk to my director if he had any issues because he was the one who told me to put everything on the back burner. I came back from the call to multiple voicemails from him saying \"I'm not going to waste my time anymore, just come to my office and fix it.\" which eventually led me to re-imaging his computer as the solution.",

        "text": "I work at a large engineering company in internal IT development. I and my 3 immediate coworkers had been with the company for 10 years or more, and we managed a complex software system that we built from the ground up over the course of these ten years. Needless to say, we didn't take lightly to uppity middle managers who had ideas (but no clue).\n\nJust after one of the frequent mergers/takeovers/name-changes so endemic in our business, we were transferred to a new middle manager. At first she seemed enthusiastic and interested in our work, but it soon appeared that she was completely clueless and it was impossible to teach her anything about what we were actually doing. She was like a scrambler - you put in clear and simple words, but out came pure nonsense. The same with information from upper mangement. After being filtered through her, it was impossible to understand what the information was supposed to be.\n\nShe soon learned to dislike the four of us. We talked back to her. We told her she was plain wrong. We told her to shut up and listen. She was manager of about 30 people - and we were the only ones who did this. So naturally we were the difficult ones. (Well - yes we absolutely were difficult). On the top of everything she was based in an office 500km away, and was doing micromanagement by telephone.\n\nNeedless to say. Our noncompliance with her nonsense was ripe and pungent. And one day she hired an external consultant to analyze what was wrong with us. She was screaming over the phone that we better do as the guy said and talk to him, or we would regret it.\n\nSo we did. We talked to the guy - at length.\n\nConsultat guy was actually a great guy. He came in beliving we were a dysfunctional group that he had to write a report on to underpin diciplinary action. After two full days of discussions he left with a report that pinpointed pretty exactly where the problem really was.\n\nWe never saw that report. We never heard from anybody about that report. But two weeks later there was a reorganization and my group was transferred to a local middle manager.\n\nTo explain the sudden reorganization, upper management came and held a powerpoint party. Mostly it was the usual drivel about how the new organization would increase productivity and make a leaner organization, and how we were such marvellous employees.\n\nBut sandwiched in there was one sentence: \"Highly skilled workers such as here at X company deserve competent and present managers.\"\n\nI believe that came from the forgotten report.",

        "text": "Hi there TFTS! Obligatory LTL/FTP and not my story but a friends.\n\nWe work at a fairly large company which encompasses ~30k users. The Service Desk consists of around 50 people total, of which around a dozen are around at the same time. There's no real second level support, there's just the First Level, the providers and engineering.\nWe also do Tech support for companies working for us.\n\nThis is the story of my friend, who shall be called **$Friend**, who works at the SD as something like an unofficial 1.5 level support.\n\nThe story also stars:\n\n\nFirst Level Supporter **$FirstLevel**\n\nFriend of Friend who also works at the Service Desk **$FOF**\n\nand the reason this story is told:\n\nAngry Customer from one of those external companies **$AC**\n\n\n\nIt's a normal day at the Service Desk. Calls and E-Mails come in. Some good, some bad, the usual.\n\n**$FirstLevel** receives a call from **$AC**\n\n&gt;\"I can't access $ImportantFile on your sharepoint! I need it ASAP for an important meeting!\"\n**$FirstLevel** does his duty in trying to help the user and tells him that they get it back as quickly as possible but they'd have to send it to **$Provider** because the Service Desk does not have access to it themselves and that  he'll mark it as urgent.\n\n&gt;\"You'd better get this solved quickly because you're costing my company lots of money if I can't make that meeting!\" **slam**\n\n**$FirstLevel** writes the ticket, marks it as urgent and sends it off to **$Provider**.\n\nVirtually that second the customer calls again and gets on the phone with **$Friend**\n&gt;\"Where's my goddamn File! I've already called you and I don't have it. I'm cancelling the meeting and I'm going to bill your company for the loss of sales!\"\n\nNow the Service Desk is small enough that you can usually hear somebody screaming over the phone nad people do talk to eachother, so **$Friend** knew that this guys last call was about a minute ago. What's even better is that **FOF** who was sitting next to him had worked at **$Company** before and knew that guy.\n\nSo **FOF** called the CIO of **$Company** with whom he was still on good terms with.\n\nWhile **$AC** was still losing his shit on the phone, threating everyone about the money he'd loose from not being able to attend the important meeting, the CIO walked to his place.\n&gt;\"Excuse me **$AC**. May I check something?\"\n*clickety click*\n\n&gt;\"Is that the file you were looking for *$AC*? Because it appears to be completely unfinished not in any way suitable for that sales meeting you just cancelled.\"\n\nThis was where the call broke off.\n\nBut **$FOF** heard through the grapevine that **$AC** no longer works at **$Company** and had already pulled off similar stunts, but this was the first time he'd been caught.\n\n\ntl;dr: Angry Sales guy tries to blame IT to get out of a meeting he didn't prepare for, gets shafted because IT guys know each other.\n\nEdit: Formatting SNAFU",

I know.)* However they had also tried a different wireless K/B &amp; M with no joy. We arranged to go on-site today (Tuesday) and essentially just have a look for the transmitter, under the guise of troubleshooting.\n\nI get to the office and see the computer switched off, and the user nowhere in sight... *relieved sigh*. I press the power button and there's no display on the monitor. ***Hmm***. \n\nBasic troubleshooting ensues, discharge static, check cable connections, reboot a few times, nothing works. Look online to see what the numbers on the front of the PC are indicating and it turns out to be bad RAM. Re-seat both modules and hey presto! Hello *4Tiles*!\n\nGet to the login screen, K/B &amp; M work fine. I let their co-worker know and I'm on my way.\n\n(I promise all of this has been important, but this is where it gets interesting)\n\nWhile I'm still in the building the user comes back and finds me, and asks me what I did (although we all know she wouldn't have a clue what I was talking about anyway). The following conversation ensues:\n\n&gt;Me: So I came in and the computer wasn't booting. It turned out the RAM wasn't seated properly so I re-seated it and the PC then booted fine, and the Keyboard and Mouse worked fine too. You said you moved the PC, what did you mean?\n\n&gt;User: Well the Hard Drive fell over\n\nOH\n\n&gt;and it hasn't worked since.\n\nWELL NO SHIT\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, that'll be the cause then. Well it's all working now.\n\n&gt;U: Where did you find the receiver?\n\n&gt;Me: It was plugged in to the front of the PC, I moved it to the back but I assume that's the one from the other Keyboard and Mouse you said you got from another desk?\n\n&gt;U: There was one in the front? I never saw it! Well thank you so much! \n\nI've never left an office so quickly before in my life. ",

        "text": "heeeeeeeeeeeey LTL of this sub, and i just remembered a tale i had dealt with last week.So as part of my job at the help desk, we do have our \"regular\" callers that most of us at the office will recognize once we see the phone number that pops up. However this short story is about a \"regular\" but for a different reason.\n\nRoles in this tale are: Me = $Me, Coworker 1= $CW1, Coworker 2 = $CW2, Supervisor = $Sup, Customer = $C, and Customer Coworker, $CCW\n\nRecently, $CW1 helped $C set up their account on a computer they received a day or two before. Then the next day, the following interaction proceeded:\n\n&gt; $Me: Help desk, this is *Sigilus*, can I help you?\n\n&gt; $C: I can't sign into my email. Can you help?\n\n&gt; $Me: Sure.\n\nDid all the usual checks at first, no lockouts occurring, log in works everywhere else that it's used. So then I tried seeing if I could remote in and look at things but for whatever reason the software on his end to run a remote connection wouldn't load at all. He decided to just call back later once the software was up.\n\nA couple hours later, $C calls back, but this time $CW2 answered the phone and decided to help the guy out. And oooooh boy did $CW2 spend a great deal of time trying to fix things. One of which included reinstalling the VPN software our client uses to access most of what they need. And that's where $CW2 left the pieces for me to pick up the next day.\n\nNext day, this time, $CCW called in for $C (I guess he was busy with other things), I finally managed to get remoted in and noticed that something was......off. $CCW did mention this little tidbit to me however, while I was working:\n\n&gt; $CCW: His account also says that it's logged in as a generic default profile. What does that mean?\n\n&gt; $Me (*internally*): uuuuhhhhhh\n\nAt this point I was relaying all the relevant information to $Sup in case he could come up with any ideas, but first thing he wanted to see is whether or not the user's account actually showed on the computer. Tried checking the account list aaaannnnd, well, let's just say the computer did show an account for him, but didn't fully recognize it.\n\nHence I spent some time getting $CCW to log into one of the admin accounts, then remoted back in. While remoted in I did end up fixing reinstalling the VPN software that $CW2 left for me to clean up, and then checked the account list again. Sure enough, his account was there. Checked the folder list for all the user accounts, aaaaaaaaand wtf? I ended up finding multiple folders with the following username format: username.domain.# (# being 1, 2, 3, etc.). Same instance also occurred for the temp folders, and the kicker? A few unknown folders with non-english characters inscribed.\n\nThe next few minutes was me trying to process what I was even looking at. $Sup decided to ask our Tier2 service what they thought, and all Tier2 said was they'll need to run a reimage, which required sending in the computer to a specific facility to do so.\n\nWhile relaying this information to $CCW, I checked $C's ticket history and what I discovered, made me both *headdesk* and laugh simultaneously out of amazement.\n\nThis was $C's third computer he's used, in 2 weeks. His original one, somehow ended up with a damaged screen, that got sent for repair. His temporary replacement he received after that, couldn't even start the OS. And now here's his 3rd computer, where Tier2 basically confirmed somehow either his profile or the OS got corrupted. Needless to say, after giving $CCW and $C their remaining options, they were disappointed to say the least. Talk about a stroke of bad luck eh?\n\nTL;DR $C was just having a really bad time",

        "text": "Hi TFST. FTP, etc.\n\nLet me regale you with a story of FTP woe and the \"change freeze\" that wasn't.\n\nCast:  \n* $Me: yours truly, DigitalPlumberNZ, at the time lead system admin for $Employer, well versed in the ways of firewalls and networks and related services  \n* $Colleague: a colleague and friend, not as good with networking but far better with the [eighth layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8) of the OSI model  \n* $DataSource: a client that sent $Employer globs of financial transaction data, said data being used by $Employer for other service offerings so their receipt was business-critical  \n* $Employer: an analytics consultancy  \n* $RM: client relationship manager at $Employer responsible for the $DataSource relationship. $RM had a grudge from the time two years previous that I over-shot a delivery deadline by three hours  \n* $0000FF: $DataSource's outsourced IT vendor\n\nImportant detail: The files from $DataSource to $Employer were sent via active FTP. It was over IPsec VPN, before anyone does what I did when I first found out that it was classic FTP and freaks the heck out.  \nThe November before this took place we'd migrated every client that sent/received data across to a new server that only had SFTP enabled. Every client, that is, except $DataSource, whose relevant manager had announced to us **after** the cut-over date (when they suddenly couldn't connect), that, actually, he never agreed to moving to SFTP and the change he'd approved was just altering the endpoint to use the new server's IP address.  \nMuch rage emanated from my desk that day, but business need overrode technical purity and so ProFTPD sullied my beautiful CentOS box. This entire story would not have happened if the SFTP cut-over had been total and final.\n\nOne early-January Thursday, whilst I was on holiday and still recovering from management's distinctly questionable decision to have us move into a new office that was still being built-out *literally* the week before Christmas (maybe a story for another day), **$Colleague** sent me an IM:\n\n&gt; Hey, sorry to bug you on holiday, **$Me**, but the data files from $DataSource have been empty since Tuesday. Looks like they're connecting because the files are being created, but they're zero-length. Could you please do the needful and check the firewall logs?\n\nImplicit in $Colleague's request was \"I hate trying to interpret the firewall logs\", despite pfSense having a pretty nice UI for the task.\n\nI dutifully logged into the firewall and checked the logs, ensured the appropriate rules were logging, and confirmed that, yes, they were indeed doing the needful at the FTP session layer.  \n\n&gt; **$Me**: It all looks fine. PfSense logs say they're getting connected, and as you say the files are being created. Could be something funky with FTP. They changed anything?\n\n&gt; **$Colleague**: Well, they're proclaiming \"change freeze\", of course. But I spoke with someone from $0000FF who said that - on deep background, and totally deniably as far as $DataSource is concerned - they'd made an emergency change to the network. Nothing to do with $DataSource, though.\n\n*Note: down here in the antipodes our change freeze periods often commence mid-November, at latest early in December, and are mostly not lifted until the second week of January when most of the workforce is expected back from Christmas holidays. As $DataSource is in retail financial services, their change freeze was longer than many to avoid disrupting their customers' Christmas shopping.  \nCrying \"change freeze\" to deflect allegations of complicity was entirely plausible had it not been for the side comment, which of course was never going to be relayed to $DataSource because, well, it couldn't possibly have been related. We never did find out what was changed, either.*  \n**We** had very definitely **not** changed anything, because nobody except me would touch the firewall or the transfer server except in the event of an unscheduled outage, and I had been on holiday since right before Christmas.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Well, something is rotten in the state of $DataSource, but it's the first week of January and I care not to do more diagnosis. It ain't the firewall, so if you figure it out, awesome, and if not it'll still be broken on Monday. My Big-Barrel-o'-Fornications[tm] is empty, I'm going back to dad-on-holiday mode.\n\nI wasn't just being cavalier, early January was pretty quiet and nothing going on needed to-the-day data at that time. They'd already got two consecutive 60-to-70-hour weeks from me with the move.\n\nCome Monday, it had been a consistent barrage of empty files over the previous nights. Something was well awry, and it fell to your intrepid narrator to go glitch-hunting. First stop was to get a contact in the department of $DataSource that generated the data files, so I could have them re-transmitted on demand. \n\nFiguring that SELinux is the bane of many an admin, and wondering if something had somehow changed about how they were sending the files, I set SELinux to permissive and restarted ProFTPD then asked the contact for a re-transmit. Empty file, nothing in audit.log, one potential scratched off the list.  \n\nNext, check for updates. Nope, nothing coming down, and no \"yum update\" run since before Christmas. Not a recently-patched bug, and not a new bug. Next cause scratched.  \n\nWanting to verify that their user could actually upload content, I FTP'd in (do **not** ask me why the previous system admin kept a record of every client's password, but that day I was thankful he had!) as $DataSource and uploaded a file. And another, and another. Then I punched the necessary holes in the firewall and did the same from a box totally off our network.  \nActive FTP, passive FTP, SFTP, totally unable to reproduce the issue. Every single file transferred successfully, and hashed the same at both ends, at sizes from a couple of MB to hundreds of MB. This issue was specific to files sent by $DataSource, not replicable as their user, and not affecting any of the other two-dozen clients uploading files (via SFTP) to this server.  \n\nBy now, $RM was also back from holiday and demanding to know what was wrong. I showed her the modification timestamps on the ProFTPD config files, dated early December. I showed her that the ProFTPD binaries were dated at the time of it being installed prior to Christmas. I showed her the login logs from the transfer server, again showing nothing since before Christmas and then after we got notified. I showed her the admin login logs from the firewall, from the last day that I worked in December and then none until after we got notified of the error. To me it was pretty clear that this was not down to a change performed by us, and she seemed to accept that. Her feathers apparently somewhat smoothed, I went back to diagnosis.  \n\nGetting stuck for possibilities, I turned the debug up to 11 and also fired up WireShark; turns out that even with allll of the debug turned on ProFTPD is not very verbose about what's happening with transactions, but hooray for plain-text connections. Some more transfers from my off-net box got a baseline for normal, so then I requested another transfer from $DataSource.  \nLooking through the packet captures, what became obvious was that the $DataSource server was not setting up the data channel. The control channel came up, the STOR command came through (hence the empty file), but the connection back from our transfer server to the $DataSource server for the data channel didn't get established.\n\n*Background: for those not familiar with [the intricacies of FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) (you lucky, lucky people!), for reasons buried in the depths of time it uses* **two** *TCP connections: one for control, initiated by the client to TCP/21 on the server; one for data transfer, initiated by* **the server** *~~to~~ from TCP/20 to a random port ~~on~~ advised by the client. That is known as active FTP, and is the [original standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959).  \nFor many reasons, allowing a client computer to accept inbound connections makes many levels of IT administrator uncomfortable, so \"passive FTP\" was introduced with the server listening on and then advising the client of an arbitrary port in TCP/1024-65535 to connect to to establish the data channel. Still two channels, one for control and one for data, but with both connections initiated by the client to the server.*\n\nWith $0000FF's assistance useless (the network guys and the mainframe guys are separate teams, and neither could initiate a transfer or monitor logs all the way through), I was left with radical surgery: replace ProFTPD. The other common FTP server software in use on Linux is vsftpd, so I disabled ProFTPD and did the needful. After confirming that I could send files with active FTP as the $DataSource user, I asked my contact to initiate a transfer...  \nAnd, sunnavabitch, it worked! So did the next one. Then I turned ProFTPD back on instead, and the transfer failed. Back to vsftpd and the transfer worked again. So did that night's transfers. It all looked the same with WireShark, but *something* was glitchy when it came to ProFTPD and the $DataSource server. Never did figure out what, either, but it kept on working through the coming year and as best I'm aware continues to work.  \n\nEpilogue: the following day, when we'd had successful overnight transfers and the ticket from $DataSource was closed, I was talking to $RM in the office kitchen.  \n&gt; **$Me**: That was bloody weird. No idea what went wrong, but I was not confident that I was going to get it fixed.  \n&gt;**$RM**: Yeah, I didn't have any confidence that you could fix it either. At least you figured out what you'd done to break it *walks away*\n\nTL;DR: Client had an unscheduled network change during a change freeze that supposedly wouldn't affect file transfers, so wasn't acknowledged by their support provider; we demonstrably changed nothing whatsoever. File transfers broke, and we got the blame because client was under \"change freeze\". Fixed it by swapping out one piece of FTP server software for another, which just sheeted home the blame further. Wouldn't have happened at all if client had shifted to SFTP as had been agreed to happen a couple of months prior.\n\nEdit: formatting  \nEdit2: thanks to u/yuubi for pointing out that it's a source port of TCP/20 on the server not a destination port of TCP/20 on the client for the data channel. See, **so** whack!",

        "text": "*So, quick backstory, I used to volunteer at a computer repair shop near where I lived. Often if a customer brought in a machine, we'd take a look at it on the front desk so that we could guess what the issue likely was and whether a) If e could repair it at all and b) Give them an estimate of cost. This also meant that if we could fix the problem right on the desk, we'd give the device back without charge.*\n\nOne day, I and a coworker (Who will be called CO because I'm original) were working the front desk, it was a pretty uneventful day until what appeared to be a mother and daughter walked into the store, and approached us. I went into my usual spiel of\n&gt;\"Hi, welcome to $STORE, how can I help you?\"  \n\nAt which point the mother says something along the lines of\n&gt;\"We bought this iPad a few days ago, and the internet on it doesn't work, do you know what's wrong?\"\n\nBefore even looking at the iPad, we established that we didn't work with apple products due to difficulty repairing them, but we would give it a cursory look as the store wasn't busy. The daughter hands us the iPad, at which point CO signs into our Guest Wi-Fi and goes onto Google, which all works perfectly.\n\nOf course, both me and CO look at the customers slightly confused, with the customers returning the same look of confusion. The mother swears that it wasn't working before, and looks at the iPad herself, internet working completely fine. She proceeds to ask us how we got it working, at which point we show her the settings, how we signed into our public guest WiFi and then navigated to Google.\n\nCO then asks whether or not they had a router, which they responded to with a yes. He then asks if they knew how to log into their WiFi, which is met with some confusion. Turns out, neither of the two even knew you HAD to connect to the WiFi, assuming it'd work straight out of the box.\n\nCO quickly explains the process of getting the information from the router, before sending the pair on their way, whilst I sit there in confused silence.\n\nAnd that's the tale of the iPad without internet.",

        "text": "In my previous role, I started out as a SQL developer. I actually quite liked this - I got a fairly intuitive grasp of working with large datasets in bulk and got to build some .Net applications on top from time to time.\n\nThe team I was in developed format processors for client data, and as such we got the unenviable task of answering client tickets. Most of them were standard-grade idiocy requiring cut-and-paste 'now do X' responses, others involved silently cursing the vendors for randomly changing working formats, but a select few were genuine WTFs.\n\nThese almost exclusively came from one person, $S at $LargeInsuranceCompanyOffshoreOffice. Every. Single. Week. this person would create a ticket and vaguely describe the error. Naturally, our attempts at making the error messages human-readable/resolvable fell flat and our users simply copied them back to us in tickets. I don't know if $S was male or female, but from the name I believe female. I had regularly referred tickets up the chain requesting $S be given more training in the product but nothing ever came of it.\n\nThen came what became The $S Ticket. It started innocuous enough:\n\n&gt;Hi, when I select $vendor from the dropdown, I see account $account.\n\nIt was 4 years ago so the specifics are lost, but I was the first to pick the ticket up and the meaning I understood from her phrasing was that she had typo'd 'do not see'. I went into the SQL backend with a few queries and confirmed the account was still there. Then I loaded up the user-facing interface to double check - yes, $account is there and is the only account. I answer the ticket as such, with a request to clarify if I had got it wrong.\n\nOf course I had. As was standard practise for these tickets, I put it back in the queue, since it was visible that I had replied, and anyone else could pick up the ticket if the client added more. So a day or two later, she did:\n\n&gt;Hi, there should be $account2 for $vendor as well as $account.\n\nMy colleague picked up the ticket this time. He confirmed what I'd done and then dug into the audit logs; the application logged just about everything it did - the audit table was enormous and difficult to navigate, relying on magic numbers and unenforced foreign keys (*shudder*). He eventually found another account for $vendor for this client and followed its lifecycle through to deletion.\n\nThe user who pushed the button was, as you've all guessed, $S.\n\nThe reason I post this story is because the application had **no less than three separate Are You Sure confirmation prompts.** Even for a Windows-trained user, clicking Yes three times in a row is unusual. Three opportunities to say No, coupled with clicking Delete in the first place.\n\nWhen my colleague called me over to show me the logs, I told him I was glad he'd taken the ticket, as I would have closed with 'Working As Designed - User Is Not'. Instead, quite diplomatically, he signed off the ticket with\n\n&gt;Hi $S, I can confirm $account2 did exist. It was deleted on $date. The deleting user was $S. Thank you.\n\nThat ticket sat at the top of the Wall of Shame until I left. Thankfully it was never beaten. $S posted many other tickets that made us cringe, including hitting the Close Ticket (we had a standard Sign Off state where it could be re-opened with new info, Close would immediately lock it permanently) button while being halfway through writing the initial ticket description. **Twice**. About six months later, $LargeInsuranceCompany quietly closed their account with us. At least we never had to deal with $S again, but I doubt she ever got the training she so obviously needed.",

        "text": "Decades ago, I had a job to install an Office Automation system (Word processing etc. but using dumb terminals and menus rather than a GUI). The users were Medical Secretaries, an awesome crew who touch-typed fast and accurately on the smart electronic typewriters they had back then. The job required training and supporting the users, mostly women in their 50's. This is a series of short anecdotes from that job, in descending order of interestingness.\n\nComputerization wasn't just change for changes sake - There were benefits for the user as well as to the hospital. Though not as many benefits as I'd thought:  \n&gt; $Me, showing off to users: To save you typing time, you can store a template letter with the hospitals address in it. Just open that template each time, and save the letter as a new file.  \n&gt; $Most users: Cool!  \n&gt; $Advanced Secretary: *Pfft* I have a macro stored in my electronic typewriter to type the address.  \n&gt; $Other users nearby: You bitch, you never told us we could do that!  \n\n----\n**Training Day**  \nI learned to start the training sessions for each new batch of users by saying:  \n&gt; $Me: Here are your new typewriters. It's not that different from what you do now - typing letters and filing them.  \n\nYou could see the relief around the room as the \"Learn to use scary computers\" training became \"Minor change in office procedures\" training.  \n&gt; $Me: I don't expect you to remember everything straight away. You get a copy of my training slides to write notes on as a reminder. My phone number is on the first slide - Phone me about anything. If your boss gets on your back while you're learning the new system, put them on to me.  \n\n\"Anything...computer related\" - I had to clarify that after some...interesting...phone calls.   \n&gt;$Me: If you ring me about something you've forgotten from the training, I'll talk you through it again. The second time you ring me, no problem, but I might be a bit sarcastic. If there's a third call for the same problem, I'll probably be quite rude to you.  \n\nThat **could** have scared them off calling me, but didn't. I got the occasional second phone call, and a couple of \"third calls\". I used the opportunity to explain things slightly differently, to ensure they understood it in their terms rather than \"computer terms\".\n\n*Thinking back:*  \n- To be able to teach something effectively, you have to have a deeper understanding of the subject than the level you're teaching at. Not just how you do things, but why.  \n- If you train your users yourself, you know how much they know, and get a better understanding of their requirements. This saves you from many misunderstandings later on.  \n- I'm amazed that the pilot batch of users understood my training sessions. I got a **lot** of feedback to incorporate into subsequent training sessions for the next batches of users.  \n- I bet the computer keyboards were rubbish compared to their typewriter keyboards. Kudos to them for adapting.  \n\n----\n**Laying cable**  \nThe rollout plan was to train each batch of users, then install the terminals the next day before they forgot the training. Now I was on their turf. My users all had the quick Scouse wit and a rough sense of humour from the job, and they ribbed the young $Me mercilessly.\nSo I'm crawling around under the desks running cables, and one of the ringleaders shouts to me at a calculated-to-be-embarrassing volume:  \n&gt; $Ringleader: Hey, $Me, are you looking up my skirt?  \n&gt; $Me: And even better, I get paid to do this!  \n\nObligatory printer side-story: The laser printers we installed were good, but refilling the toner was awful - You had to squirt fine black powder from a refill bottle into the toner hopper. Much toner was spilled and many paper towels used up. Fortunately my lovely users took over that task, and made less mess than I did. (That wasn't \"strategic incompetance\" on my part - It was quicker for them to do it themselves than to wait for me to drive out to their office).\n\n----\n**Flip-flop**  \nOne user in her 60's had some trouble adapting to the computer. I hadn't heard the term \"muscle memory\" back then, but that was basically the issue - she knew what to do, but her hands took over when she had her headset on listening to the dictation tape she was transcribing. I had lots of complaints from her about the computer system, but we worked through them. She didn't really need help, just some moral support.\n\nWe'll call her $DOL (Dedicated Older Lady). One Monday, I got a phone call from $DOL:  \n&gt; $DOL: I was getting behind on my work, so I took my old typewriter home for the weekend to catch up.  \n&gt; $Me: Sorry to hear that...(dreading a barrage of complaints)  \n&gt; $DOL: And I'd forgotten how bad the typewriters were! The computer is so much better!  \n&gt; $Me: ...(stunned silence)  \n\n$DOL went from enemy to staunch ally over a weekend.\n\n----\n**0's and 1's**  \nOne user had a trick to speed up her touch-typing - Instead of moving her hands to the number row to type zeros and ones, she typed O (Oh) and l (ell) characters instead. Letters were filed using the Patient number, so this became an issue:  \n&gt; $User: But they look the same!  \n&gt; $Me: True, but no-one else can find letters you've typed, so we lose the case-history for a patient.  \n\nThe computer system enabled you to search the text of documents and move them. So this wasn't a problem as much as an admin task to re-file the documents. $User changed her habits, and I eventually developed a script to automate changing the filenames to replace O's and l's with numerics.\n\n---- \n**The long letter**  \nOne user was used to computers and word processing. She'd worked out a method where she typed up the entire tape from a Doctor's day as one long document and saved it with the days date in the file name so she could find it again.  \n&gt; $Her: This procedure works for me.  \n&gt; $Me: Sure, but no-one else can find letters you've typed, so we lose the case-history for a patient.  \n\nShe had many valid complaints about why the Office Automation system wasn't as good as her PC + Word processing software. But eventually she agreed that the additional features outweighed the PC/WP features she'd lost.\n\n----\n**Comms delays**  \nAnother pair of users had PC + WP setups. They needed to keep them for the private work their Doctors did. So we decided to install a comms card in the PCs plus a terminal emulator, to talk to the Office Automation system.  \n&gt; $Users: When we're typing, the characters don't appear on the screen until about 5 seconds later. It's really offputting.  \n\nI tried a few things to eliminate the emulator lag, but eventually we gave up and installed dumb terminals beside their PCs.\n\n----\n**TIFU - inodes**  \nWhen you create a new file on a computer, the computer reserves a block of disk to allow the file to grow without becoming too fragmented across several areas of disk. It's efficient for reading/writing files, but wasteful if the files are smaller than the minimum block size. \n\nThe Office Automation system documents were basically plain text, with no template, properties or formatting information stored in the file. So a 400-character letter was stored as 400 bytes. Compare that to opening and saving a new MS Word document - around 1MB for an empty file.\n\nThe filesystems that were set up to save documents on had been created with a minimum block size of 4KB*, roughly 10 times the size of a typical letter, so the server ran out of usable storage much faster than expected. Disk was expensive then, so we didn't have any spares. I had to back up each filesystem, recreate the filesystem to allow a minimum block size of 512 Bytes, then restore the files. \n\n\\* 4KB was the vendor recommendation for systems that would store many \"small\" files. It's a trade-off, as allowing tiny files means you need a bigger index file (inode table) to reference all the disk-block addresses.\n\n----\n**TL/DR:** I trained users, and learned as much about people as they learned about computers.  \n**Edit:** Formatting, thanks Gtantha",

Juliet is waking up.\n\n&gt; **Me:** *(Thinks)* Oh god, not now...\n\n&gt; **Customer:** And that's when I noticed that the data was missing from...\n\nMy desktop monitor flickers to BSOD-blue, then goes dark for a moment, and then I'm staring at a close-up of snowflakes - one of the Windows 10 lock screen images.  My headset is silent.  I can no longer see nor hear my customer.\n\n&gt; **Me:** *(Thinks)* Crap crap crap...\n\nI hurriedly pound the control key and log in.  The online meeting resumes.\n\n&gt; **Customer:** ...decided it was best to restart the...\n\nOh, good, he didn't seem to notice I was gone.  I try my best to pick up what the customer has been saying, while I spare a glance over my shoulder to glare at the laptop behind me, which has fallen silent.  Juliet has nodded off again.\n\n---\n\nHello, my name is Merkuri, and I do vendor tech support for industrial/business software.  But today's tale isn't about something crazy our software or customers did.  It's the tragic tale of love between a middle-aged desktop and an elderly insomniac laptop.\n\nMost of the time, I'm attached to my desk by a chain forged from email, quenched in customer tears.  I don't do much traveling.  So I, like the rest of my department, have a desktop.  For the purposes of this story we'll call that desktop, Romeo.  Romeo's a perfectly average desktop.  His days of scampering up balconies are a bit behind him, but he's not so old that he's forgotten how to handle his sword.  ...Or some other non-phalic metaphor...\n\nAnyway, I do the lion's share of my work with Romeo, however, I am a manager, and sometimes I find myself in meetings where the fate of the world is decided... either that or we argue about whether QA or support should test how many polylines a customer should be putting on a display.  These meetings can be something like war, long period of boredom punctuated by moments of--no, sorry, it's just all boredom.  And for that, I also have a laptop.  A shitty afterthought of a laptop that IT graciously gave to me when someone else upgraded and left this behind.\n\nMy laptop is not top priority for the company, given as how it's basically just a remote desktop shell used approximately three hours out of the week.  It originally had Windows 8.0 on it.  I had to beg for six months to get it upgraded to 8.1.  The idea of upgrading it further to Windows 10 gets me laughed out of the room.\n\nWe will call my laptop, Juliet.  Because she's nearly 14 years old and a bit stupid.\n\nJuliet has insomnia.  She's had it for years.  She's not the only laptop I've met with insomnia.  It seems to be the laptop version of gray hair and a sense of entitlement.  If you're not familiar with it, laptops experience insomnia by randomly waking from a sleeping state when no one has so much as breathed on the mouse or keyboard.  I'm familiar with the process of looking through the logs to find out what woke the laptop and turning that off, but for some reason Juliet never recorded what woke her up.  I turned off every wake mechanism I could find except the power button, but the old girl just keeps waking up.\n\nSo in lieu of fixing it, I learned to just ignore it.  Most days Juliet sits quietly at my desk while I work with Romeo.  Once a week or so, for no apparent reason, her fan will just start to whir up.  Most times it'll run for a few seconds and then shut off on its own.  If I notice the fan going for a while I'll just lift her lid for a second and drop it back down, which is enough to send her back to sleep.\n\nWe lived like that for years, the three of us.  But about two months ago things got weird.  (Yes, it can get weirder than a threesome with Shakespearean computers.)\n\n---\n\nI was working along, minding my own business (and everyone else's in the department - I am the boss, you know), when Romeo's monitor turned blue.\n\nIt was that shade of blue that makes your innards quiver.  They say that most people's dreams aren't in color, but this was the blue sheen of IT nightmares.  I stopped breathing.\n\nThe wash of color lasted for only a moment, then the screen went black.  I started sweating.  Oh Romeo... wherefore art thou?\n\nThen suddenly I was looking at a picture of brightly colored boats washed up on a beach.  I blinked.  This was the lock screen.  My brain switched gears from horror to confusion.  I logged in.  Everything was right where I left it.\n\nMy pulse slowly returned to normal.  That was weird, I thought.  I asked if anyone around me had had computer problems.  Everyone else was fine.\n\nSince nothing was amiss, I shrugged, got back to work and put the event out of my mind.\n\n---\n\nAbout a week later, the same thing happened - out of nowhere, bowel-liquefying blue, heart-stopping black, then a pretty sunset.\n\nAs I stared at the sunset and blinked my brain started doing mental dumpster diving, and I realized something.  About ten seconds before Romeo had a seizure, I'd heard Juliet's fan spin up.  Furthermore, I'd heard it the first time, too.  I had been so used to hearing her fan that my brain had automatically dumped that data into the audio trash next to the hall door opening, someone sneezing, and that cell phone across the office that makes that chirping sound from Star Trek every few hours.\n\nBut now that I was reviewing the mental logs, it was definitely the same both times.  Juliet rolled over in her sleep, then ten seconds later Romeo seized.\n\nWhen it happened that second time I started thinking about what on earth was connecting those two machines.  They were logged in with the same domain account, but I couldn't think of anything the domain would do that.  I mean, even if this was an effect of some policy getting pushed down, what sort of policy locks one computer and wakes up another?  How could Juliet even receive a new policy in her sleep?  And why now?  Juliet has been an insomniac forever.\n\nThey were plugged into the same outlet, but two different surge protectors.  Was this some sort of power surge overpowering the surge protectors that hit both Romeo and Juliet differently?  A brief power drain that caused Romeo to half-shut down, and Juliet to go on battery power and wake up?\n\nIt kept happening, always the same sequence of events - fan, blue, black, canyon shot or beach or pastoral wilderness.  It was fucking annoying.  \n\nI called building maintenance.  They came and checked my outlet and found nothing wrong.  \n\nI called IT.  They had no clue.  They offered to replace Juliet, but the only laptop they had available was even more senile.  Juliet had her quirks, but at least I knew what they were and how to work around them.  I wasn't eager to invite some other medieval laptop into my life.  The devil you know, and so on.  \n\nSo I offered to do some tests before anyone took drastic action.\n\n---\n\nI banished Juliet.  I took her and her surge protector and plugged them in across the room from Romeo.\n\n(What's that?  Romeo was one who was banished in the play?  Yeah, well why don't *you* try moving a desktop tower, two monitors, cabling, keyboard, mouse, etc. just for the sake of a running gag and tell me how *you* like it?)\n\nWe ran like that for a week or two, and the problem seemed to stop.  I kept waiting to hear if Juliet could wake up without Romeo seizing, but I never heard Juliet.  Not a whisper.  Apparently her banishment bed was more comfy than the one she'd shared with Romeo on my desk.  Maybe Romeo has wandering elbows at night.  Or maybe she'd taken some sort of protest potion to put her into a coma.  (Hell with reuniting with her lover, I think she took that potion just to get some damn uninterrupted sleep.)\n\nI gave up waiting for Juliet to wake up and decided to try test number two.  Maybe it wasn't the outlet that was the problem, maybe it was Juliet's old and crappy surge protector.  So I left Juliet's surge protector across the room and reunited her with Romeo.  I plugged her into the same surge protector that Romeo used.  \n\nA couple days go by and the issue happens again.  Aha! I thought.  It's not the surge protector.  It's something about Romeo and Juliet being plugged into the same outlet.  Maybe Juliet has degraded to the point where her power supply is somehow faulty, and she's draining more voltage than she should when she wakes up, causing Romeo to lose power briefly enough to lock himself?  I'm not an electrical engineer, I have no idea if that's anywhere in the realm of reality.  All I know is that when Juliet was across the room, this didn't happen, so I re-banished Juliet and reported my findings to IT.  \n\nI figured the next step was that other laptop.  *shudder*  I told them it wasn't that big of a deal.  I'd just leave Juliet plugged in across the room.  But if some extra dollars come into the budget and they found it in their hearts to get me a brand new machine instead of some hand-me-down, I'd be here.\n\n---\n\nA couple of weeks after I had re-banished Juliet, I was doing my usual work with Romeo when I heard it.  Across the room, Juliet woke up.  And ten seconds later, Romeo seized.  \n\nI stared in disbelief at Juliet.  From across the room, these star-crossed lovers were somehow touching each other.\n\nDefeated, I spun my chair around, logged back into Romeo, and started writing up another letter to IT about how I hadn't solved the problem after all, and I had no idea what to try next.\n\n...Then my fingers paused, mid-keystroke.  Something in my brain had been dumpster diving again.  It had found a two, and then a two, and was holding one in each hand, considering.\n\nThe week before, I'd attended an internal summit.  I'd basically spent the entire week away from my desk with Juliet.  As usual, I'd been using her for remote desktopping into Romeo.  I had a habit of just closing Juliet's lid when I had to get up for a break or something.  When I opened her up again I was used to having to log in twice - once into Juliet, and then again into the session to Romeo.  But I had noticed that week that I only had to log in once.  The connection to Romeo logged in automatically.  That was a pleasant change, I'd thought - less typing.\n\n*...Two and two make...*\n\nI lifted my hands from Romeo's keyboard, letter to IT half-written.  I wheeled my office chair over to Juliet, lifted her lid, and logged in.  I looked over at Romeo while Juliet loaded.\n\nRomeo went blue, then black, then showed the lock screen.  I looked down.  On Juliet's screen, I saw my half-written IT letter.\n\n*Four.*\n\nSome update of Windows or our domain policies had suddenly allowed Juliet to remember her session to Romeo when she hadn't been able to before.  So now, whenever she insomnia'd she would have just enough time to snag my desktop session away from Romeo before she fell back into dreamless slumber.\n\nI deleted my letter to IT and wrote a new one to tell them the solution - I need to make sure I fully closed my remote desktop session before putting Juliet to sleep.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Minor formatting.",

Not cause she's old (I wish that was the case), but because she was extremely impatient.\n\nShe was having sound issues which are usually fixed by a quick reset of the set top box and that was a problem for two reasons:\n\n1.\tShe was very uncooperative, throwing sentences like: \"Do you think I work for you?!\", \"You need to send a technician in here right this moment!\" and etc'\n\n2.\tIt takes a while. Not too long, about ~7 minutes. But I knew that with this lady those are gonna be a looooooooooooooooong 7 minutes.\n\nAnyhow after about 10 minutes of explaining why she doesn't need a technician to come over she finally caves in and agree to cooperate. We start the reset process and we get to the initial setup screen. Now that thing was designed to be the most user friendly thing in the entire UI, but with her, sadly nothing was easy. \n\n\n&gt;Me: \"Ok what do you see?\"\n\n&gt;Her: \"It says chose a language\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Alright go ahead and do that, next you'll...\"\n\n&gt;Her: \"Wait, what do I chose here\"\n\n&gt;Me: ... \n\n&gt;Her: \"HELLOOOOOOOOO ARE YOU HERE?!

SEND A TECHNICIAN HERE RIGHT NOW OR I'LL SUE YOU!!!\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"We're almost finished I promise, can you just read it again for the last time?\"\n\n&gt;Her sighing as if she's tired of this \"hard work\" of pressing buttons on a remote: \"Press OK to continue\"\n\n&gt;Me: ................................. \"Press OK\" \n\n&gt;Her: \"Alright\", \"finally it's working normally again\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm happy to hear that\", \"Now that everything works to your satisfaction, is there anything else I can help you with?\"\n\n&gt;Her: \"I WANT COMPENSATION FOR ALL THIS TROUBLE\"\n\n&gt;Me: ................................................................\n",

        "text": "This is ongoing.  Hopefully it'll be finished before I leave cell-reception tomorrow to go camping.\n\nI'm less than a committed employee - I put in my time and I GTFO.  So when I got to work an hour early today, I assumed I'd leave early too and there's no goddamn idiots who can force me, except my boss who's already gone for the weekend because this customer is so aggravatingly stupid. Let's call them BrainDrain because it's similar to their name AND vague!  They're full of idiots.  I should be kind though - their VP of IoT engineering is intelligent, as seems to be one of their chip designers.\n\nThe quality of tickets we get (they have an IT person who's supposed to deal with the simple shit) are like:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; I am noticing the following error .... blah blah please help i can't work ....\n\n     [user@server5 workdir]$ &lt;binary&gt; sync\n      &lt;server&gt; password invalid or unset\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Dumbo\n\nThat's one of the more coherent ones :|\n\nAnyway, the intelligent VP locked down the server so this team wouldn't be able to access any previous work, and has probably saved them multiple times already.  But today was special, today they needed our help creating a new project (first: REALLY guys, REALLY?)\n\nAnd then, once they got that done (they hadn't sourced the file that sets all the necessary variables to see the binaries and config files), they created a second project (I'M SO PROUD OF THEM!) and wanted to lock it down for their India team (smart.  very smart).  Because we don't trust them, we'll write the protections and let them load them up.  First, however, we need to see what's there already ... and I smell burning.\n\nTurns out that was literally - our neighbor company had somebody set a burrito to microwave for 100 minutes.  It caught fire.  But also figuratively - their protections are terrible.  It grants permissions three times, no longer removes any access, and doesn't  remove write access to a supposedly immutable part of the database (this is where frozen code for tapeouts goes).  To make matters worse, this guy has told me he tried to load new permissions from stdin a couple times.  He had no idea what the hell he was doing, and at this point four people headdesked.  Literally.  You delete servers that way.  (Has also happened)\n\nInstead of calling like he asked (because nobody wants to be fired for shouting at a customer), we request (demand) the info needed to properly lock down those permissions, which isn't entirely provided.  When we request clarification, he promptly responds helpfully.  Lol, that would be nice.  No, instead we get:\n\n&gt;  For existing projects, can we leave the settings as-is so that we don’t rock the boat\n\nNo.  No you can't.  The tapeout code is still writable.  With any other customer, they wouldn't have messed with this so much or even asked because they're mildly competent.  So again, what's that last piece of info we need?  ... aaand radio silence.\n\nSo joke's on them - they're incompetent enough to lock down the projects they can't tell us about until further notice.  That'll be fun\n\nEDIT: I have my answers.  They have their instructions.  Come Monday, we'll probably have tickets because their India office has been using old projects or something stupid like that.",

        "text": "This happened a few days ago during an especially hectic week with many of my colleagues either sick or skiing down the slopes of some frostbitten Swedish mountain.\n\nAs many of you might have experienced, some clients are notorious for never reporting issues or problems until the midden hits the windmill and then light the bonfires and sound the horn. This is one of those. Just before the holidays last year I handled their migration to G-Suite. Some teething problems remain, mostly related to how they want G-Suite to work and how it can't (They insisted on having it...). However this one I was greeted by via email from the clients CEO, CC:d to my boss.\n\n&gt;\"I have just been over at our restaurant and email is NOT working. It needs to be fixed immediately. $F isn't getting the emails he's supposed to! We need you here now.\"\n\nSeeing as I was occupied with another client I just quickly sent to my boss I had my hands full at the moment. He rings me up a few seconds later.\n\n&gt;$Boss: \"Hi. All of us are occupied over here in $TOWN, so nobody can get out to $CLIENT today. Could you make the drive?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Let me just finish up.\"\n\n&gt;$Boss: \"Okay!\"\n\nGetting from my office to $TOWN is an hours drive in dusk lit wet awfulness and then having to navigate a small city where traffic is 'interesting'. (I'm a country girl, I don't like driving in cities.)\n\nI arrived an hour later, and eventually found my way inside the restaurant to find F running around.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Hi, I'm here regarding the email problems?

Billed accordingly.\n\nEdit2: I should add some additional background for this client: Nearly every email issue this client has had so far since the migration (or before) is a matter of 'showing them how to do things'. Be it on a computer or phone. For some reason beyond me, they are impervious to 'remote education'. You nearly always need to be there in person to show them how to do things.

This system has been relatively unchanged for years, and thats because it works. It has few bugs, when it crashes it comes back up quickly, and it does everything we need it to. \nNow in our work meeting today, we were talking about a new Service Complaint check box thats been added to our SoftPhone program (the phone program that connects our desktop to our telephone) and we use the check box to mark when a call includes a service complaint from a customer. \nI have a coworker (lets name him Brad) who brought up this box in the meeting. He said, rather coy, “Why not just add the complaint box to (banking system)?” \nThe presenter says “Oh we’ve definitely tried work it in but its near impossible. The system we have is good where it is and changes can cause problems. We’ve been working on a solution to add it but it looks bleak at the moment.” \nThis causes Brad to go on a tirade, saying things including “Well maybe if the IT department wasnt lazy and could do their jobs we wouldnt have to do extra work” and “They can do it, they just wanted to take the easy route.” \nI’m not a programmer, but I know how touchy code can be and I’m ASSUMING they tried quite a few ways to add this feature and it upset something that caused the system to crash (and this is our main program we use; if it goes down, anything we do would essentially be impossible.) \nBrad and the presenter fight back and forth about this for about 10 minutes before the manager makes them move on. Brad is a real meat head guy. I asked him when we got back from the meeting “Brad, do you know programming? Because what you’re asking is similar to putting windshield wipers on a horse and buggy.” \nHe says to me “No, but I know computers. It’s not that hard to move some stuff around.” ",

        "text": "Yesterday, I re-imaged a faculty member's iMac (I will refer to him as FM). He had been having issues for months and was not on our most updated system (he had a local admin account, we're finally integrating our Macs into AD). I made sure that everything was backed up, and confirmed with him that his drive would be erased. He confirmed before I started, \"Everything I need is backed up.\" I checked which programs he needed, only a couple of things that weren't standard.\n\nI image it at his desk, and push the software he needs. I get his Mail and printers working, he confirms his software is working. It was mostly painless, and went a lot smoother and quicker than I thought. One issue I ran into with him is when it prompted him to sign into his Apple ID when it created his profile (we can't figure out a way to turn this off):\n\n&gt;$Me: You can-\n\n&gt;$FM: Should I sign in?\n\n&gt;$Me: If you want to. (Some people want to, and we technically allow them to, I kinda assumed he did before so I should have explained it more in depth to him)\n\nHe signs in and sees that all of his personal accounts are on there, and explains that he doesn't want them on there. I show him how to disable and remove the accounts, so that just his work one is on there. This user can be hard to pin down, and is particular about how their system is set up. I thought it was going to be a lot more complicated than it was, so when I left we were both happy.\n\nI then got three calls later that afternoon, 30 minutes to closing time from him:\n\nCall 1:\n\n&gt;$FM: How come I can't login to my system anymore? It locked on me and now it's not accepting my password.\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm not sure, let me remote in and see what's happening.\n\nI remote in and see it not accepting his password. I try to go back and enter my credentials but there's no \"Switch User\" option, and cancel is doing nothing. As I'm about to have him restart, he gets in. I honestly believe he was just mistyping it before.\n\nCall 2:\n\n&gt;$FM: How come I can't change my firewall settings?\n\n&gt;$Me: You probably don't have the rights to do so after we re-imaged your computer.\n\n&gt;$FM: Well I need to be able to adjust these settings for my software.\n\n&gt;$Me: What software is it?\n\n&gt;$FM: Skype and some $ThirdPartySoftware\n\n&gt;$Me (internally): He didn't even have Skype on his old system, and he didn't ask for it. He also won't be able to download on his own anymore, and we don't officially support it.\n\nI remote in and see him messing around in FileVault and Firewall, in Security &amp; Privacy.\n\n&gt;$FM: Why didn't you turn these things on for me?\n\n&gt;$Me: Those are settings disabled in Mac OS by default, I didn't change them (we put an OEM image on Macs, no settings changed).\n\n&gt;$FM: Well you should really ask users these types of things when you work on their computers.\n\n&gt;$Me: I did ask you about your computer and what software you needed, you didn't mention anything needing these settings configured. I've never messed with them myself, and I don't set the policies for what settings are turned on/off when we deploy images.\n\nHe then tries to turn FileVault on, and I enter the admin credentials. It prompts him to enter his Apple ID and password, which he doesn't want to do because personal. I check if that's all he needs and end the call.\n\nCall 3:\n\n&gt;$FM: Where are my shared drives?\n\n&gt;$Me: I didn't see any mapped on your old system, I wasn't sure if you were utilizing those. (That's partially on me; they don't mount automatically on our Macs even if you're signed into AD. You also have to turn on the settings to show the icon on the desktop. I should have double-checked the servers, or asked him, but since not all Mac users are utilizing them yet, some of them have no idea what I'm talking about when I ask. ).\n\n&gt;$FM: Well I know it was there before, I was using them.\n\n&gt;$Me: I understand, I just didn't see them before wiping your computer and you hadn't mentioned using them. I'll have to reach out to networking and grab the path, I don't have access to those tools unfortunately. And I'm not sure if anyone's still there quarter to 5, it might not be until tomorrow.\n\n&gt;$FM: Great, now I have a new computer sitting at my desk that I can't use to work.\n\n&gt;$Me: I understand, and I'm sorry for all the trouble you've gone through. I'll reach out to you as soon as I have more information.\n\nI truly do understand not being able to work, and forgetting certain things. But I really do wish he had brought those things up before I left, and I could have worked on them sooner.",

So we offered to install internet installations to customers and give them 1st/2nd-line support. If we couldn't fix it, we would send the ticket to the ISP for 3rd line support. We were short on employees and I liked to do them both, so my days were split in 3-days support(Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and 2 days installation(Tuesday, Thursday).\n\nOne day a customer calls (Wednesday):\n\n**$TECH1:** \"Hello, how can I help you?\"\n\n**$CUSTOMER1**: \"Yes hello, my internet isn't working. It worked fine yesterday.\"\n\n**$TECH1:** \"Ok, Have you tried turning off and then restarting the modem?\"\n\n**$CUSTOMER1:** \"Yes, but nothing happens, not even the blinking lights turn on.\"\n\n**$TECH1:** \"Oh, maybe your modem is defect. But maybe a stupid question: Is your cable plugged in?\"\n\n**$CUSTOMER1:** \"YES OFCOURSE MY CABLE IS PLUGGED IN! DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? I REQUEST A NEW MODEM INSTALLATION NOW\". \n\n**$TECH1:** \"Ofcourse, sir, how about tomorrow at 9AM?\"\n\n**$CUSTOMER1:** \"YES THANK YOU!\" \n\nHe hung up immediately. Because it was Wednesday, I had installation the following day, so I would go to this customer. I brought my tools + a shiny new modem. I sat down at the customer's modem and what do you know? The power cable is unplugged. I plugged it back in and it worked again. You could see the dread and shame in his eyes when I told him the problem. \"B-but, it was plugged in, I swear!\". \n\nWe had a policy and the customers knew this: If it's our fault, it's free, if it's your fault, you pay. It wasn't a huge bill, but a bill nonetheless. Customer wasn't happy, but that's part of the game.",

He usually has entertaining stories and is quite a character. He thinks highly of me, trusts my opinion, and believes in my competence. This was earned through years of issue resolution and a few 'saving the day' (read: lucky) fixes. He is pretty tech savvy, but most of his knowledge is pre-2000. A lot of his ideas are outdated, but he has a pretty good grasp on the basics.\n\n That being said, he is extremely paranoid and security is his main focus. *EVERYTHING* starts with the pre-tense that he has been compromised or 'something fishy' is going on. Every phone call takes a minimum of 30 minutes, the majority is shooting the breeze and asking my opinion on some new fangled tech he read about in PC Mag or whatever. 99% of his issues are solved by the good ol' fashioned reboot.

I glance at the caller ID, $eu. \n\n*What a great way to start the morning. Here goes a wasted hour.* I think to myself.  I glance back at my brewing cup of life. Done. *Well at least I have that going for me.* I pick up the phone, and try my best not to sound irritated. \n\n&gt;$me : '$greeting this is $me.'  \n$eu :  'Hellooo $me! This is $eu with $eu_company. Got a laptop here that is being reallly slow. Slower than molasses! You pushing updates this morning? Got a minute to take a look? This isn't pressing, low priority. This is the laptop I use for testing $program and as a backup in case someone else's kicks the can.'  \n$me: 'Sure. What's the system number?'  \n$eu: '$ConvolutedSystemNumberHeCameUpWith'  \n$me: 'Connecting now.'\n\nI click connect in my RMM and watch the wheel spin round and round. I'm greeted by one of my least favorite dialog boxes. \"Failed to connect.\" *Awesome. Just what I need.*\n\n&gt;$me: 'Hey $eu I'm having trouble connecting. Can you give me a hand? Go to $SupportSite and let's see if I can't get connected that way.  \n$eu: 'Clicking on the browser now, spinning wheel.

Still can't connect, still can't load a web browser, and the reboots are taking a solid 5-10 minutes. \n\n&gt;$me: 'Alright $eu. Doesn't look like I can fix this remotely. Hopefully we don't have a failed drive on our hands, or some other hardware problem. Do you have anytime to swing it by and I can do some diagnostics? In the meantime let it sit and maybe it'll sort it self out. Probably not, but it's not going to hurt anything. '  \n$eu: 'Sure. I'll swing it by later this week.'  \n$me: 'Great! See you then.' \n\n*Click!*  \n\nWell, at least that is over with. It's an old laptop, could be choking on an update, maybe the HDD is failing, maybe it's overheating. Who knows? I won't know until I get my hands on it. At this point my coffee is gone, and carry on with my day forgetting about $eu and the old laptop. \n\n###Later that week: \n\n$eu shows up, drops off the laptop. I tell him that I'll check it out. I'll make sure it's up to date and let him know the status of the hardware. I plug the laptop in after he leaves and start checking things out. It's an older HP Probook, halfway decent specs for a 6 year old laptop. I do the usual stuff, update drivers, OS updates, a few diagnostics, everything looks peachy keen. The event log shows nothing out of the ordinary. Laptop isn't blazing fast (it's 6 years old) but it's serviceable and behaves like I would expect. Nothing is wrong with it as far as I can tell. I can't find any rhyme or reason as to why it was behaving the way it was earlier in the week. I shrug it off and figure 'It's just one of those things.' I tell $eu that the laptop has a clean bill of health, and he picks it up the next day. I make up some excuse about pending updates and outdated drivers. I figure that's the end of it. WRONG. \n\n###Next day. \n\nPhone rings. $eu. I mentally prepare myself and get on with it. \n\n&gt;$me: 'Hey $eu, what's up?'  \n$eu: 'Well you aren't going to like this but that laptop is acting up again. It won't do anything. It's basically comatose!'  \n$me: 'Weird. Let me see if I can get connected this time.' \n\nNo dice. Same story as before. Something is amiss, and I don't know what. \n\n&gt;$me: 'Hey $eu, how's the airflow around that laptop? Any obstructions? Is it running hot at all?'  \n$eu: 'Nope! I've got in on a table that's clear of any debris and the room is a cool 68 degrees Fahrenheit! I've even got it propped up on feet to make sure it has some airflow on the underside.'  \n\n*That's a little overkill, but good I guess*\n\n&gt;$eu: 'I'll be up your way next week and I'll swing it by again. It's a low priority. Let's forget about it for now.'  \n$me: 'Sounds good. Sorry it was fine when it was here.'  \n$eu: 'No worries! We'll get it figured out.' \n\nWhat could he be doing to cause this? Is he just being overly-sensitive? Is he expecting too much from the laptop? Whatever, perhaps the issue will rear it's head next week when my hands are on it again. \n\n###Next week. \n\n\n$eu drops off laptop. We decide to do a clean install and see if that helps. Surely that will resolve anything software related. I wipe the machine, and install a fresh copy of Win 10 pro. Again, the laptop is running as smooth as I expect it to. It's pretty responsive, not blazing fast but serviceable. I think I got it this time. I notify $eu and he picks it up a day later. He's sure we've got it too. Problem solved. \n\nWRONG. \n\n###Next day. \n\nPhone call from $eu. Laptop is acting up again. Same story. He's now convinced it's rogue traffic on his network slowing the machine down. Even though it's the only machine exhibiting this behavior. \n\n&gt;$me: 'You know what $eu? I'm scheduled to come down there next week to replace that failed drive in your array. I already have the drive, so why I don't I come down today. I'll take a look at that laptop while it's acting up since it won't do it here.'  \n$eu: 'Great! See you in a bit.' \n\nI head down to $eu's office. New drive in hand. The laptop is taunting me. What on earth could be going on? It's fine in my office. Not fine in his. It has to be environmental. It has to be. \n\nI show up at $eu's office and replace the failed drive. He takes me down to where the laptop is. It's exactly as he described. \n\nThe laptop is sitting on a cleared desk, propped up on rubber feet, power cord plugged in, a single Cat6 cable in the ethernet port, and the room is a cool 68 degrees. The laptop is acting as he described as well. Painfully slow. \n\nI take in the scene. What's the difference? I feel like I'm staring at the pages of a children's magazine at the dentist's office. You know the one's with the two pictures side by side, and you're supposed to identify the minute differences. \n\nLaptop. Table. Ethernet. Power cord. Cool room. \n\n&gt;$eu: 'I removed the ethernet cable, and made sure it wasn't on the wifi. It acts the same so that kind of rules out my idea of network traffic overload or something.'  \n\nLaptop. Table. Ethernet. Power cord. Cool room. \n\nSame as my office. \n\n**WAIT**. \n\n*Power cord.*\n\nIt hits me like a ton of bricks.   \n*He never brought the power cord with him. I used MY power adapter.*  \nI grab the power adapter and inspect the fine print. No-name Travel adapter. 60 watts. \n\n&gt;$me: 'Hey $eu... you didn't happen to swap out the power adapter for a different one before this all started happening did you?'  \n$eu: 'Now that you mention it...I was using this other one before...'\n\nHe fumbles through some desk drawers and pulls out a power adapter. I grab it and take a look at it. HP OEM. 90 watts. I hastily swap out the adapter, and like magic, the laptop springs to life. I pull up task manager and check the CPU frequency. Operating like normal. I show $eu this. I swap back to the travel adapter, half-speed on the CPU. \n\n$eu facepalms. \n\n&gt;$eu: 'Son of a biscuit eater! I didn't even think about that!'\n\nHe feels terrible and blames himself. I tell him how it didn't even cross my mind until I was standing in front of it assessing the situation. I've run into it before a few times, but usually it's when the laptop is in front of me. \n\nWe laugh about it, and he now always remembers to check the power adapter when plugging in a laptop. \n\n###Sometimes you have to observe users in their natural habitat. \n\n\n**TL;DR slow laptop caused by inappropriate adapter caused wayyy too much work**\n\n",

This tale comes from my most recent *IT Ghost^tm\" happenings where I change things when people are on vacation.\n\nI switched a lady's computer out during the most recent hardware refresh we did. Her nomenclature shall follow the form of $Jill.\n\n&gt;$Jill: Hey, while you're here can you look at something please? I'm getting an error\n\n*detour time*\n&gt;$DT: Sure! what's up?\n\nTurns out I had missed something upon setup that is particular to only a few users and isn't something that's a part of the normal setup checklist. The instant I sit down at her computer, the monitor flashes, warps, twirls, and flickers.\n\n&gt;$DT: wow, I guess I need to replace that cable. How long has your monitor done this? I didn't notice it when I swapped out your computer.\n\n&gt;$Jill: oh, I thought that was normal because I got a laptop. it's been that way since I got back.\n\n*?_?*.....\n________________________________________________\n\nPrologue: I replaced her old desktop computer with a laptop and docking station, and was incredibly mean to the cabling because it was a huge mess and I wanted to fix it right, including a decent attempt to make the crappy VGA to DisplayPort^tm adapter for said monitor fail before she came back. \n\nApparently, nothing breaks when I'm near it.

        "text": "I am confident most of us working with IT also have plenty of tech support with friends and family too. This story is about how I wanted to help my sister and my nephew with ad hoc internet access during Christmas.\n\nBoth my sister and I live abroad so we don’t see each other that often because she lives in South America, and I live in Europe. This Christmas we met at our mothers house in another European country. She had stayed there 3-4 weeks already, and was getting abstinence from no internet. Yeah, my mother is one of those few people that don’t have internet. She detests new technology. \n\nMy sister did not have affordable 4G data with her South American phone subscription, so when she needed to get online she turned to me for help, because I have 8 GB mobile data I can use when traveling within the European Union. Her son, my nephew, also needed to check a few things online.\n\n&gt; Sister: /u/far2fish could you please turn on net sharing and hotspot please? I need to check my plane ticket reservations, check the news and send a few emails.  \n\n&gt; Nephew: I’d like to use WhatsApp for a bit.  \n\n&gt; Me: Sure thing, I will setup a hotspot, but please don’t use Netflix or YouTube, because I have already travelled a lot in Europe this month, so I have used about 30 percent of my free data already.  \n\n&gt; Sister: Yes of course.\n\n\nSo I open up a book I was reading, and chill out on the couch when they are online. Then after about 1 hour I suddenly get a notification on my phone. It is a text message from my phone company:\n\n__You have spent 80 percent of you data__\n\n&gt; Me: That can’t be right. I am running out of data.  \n\n&gt; Sister: That is strange, because I have only checked my inbox and sent a few emails.\n\n\n*ding* New text message:\n\n__You have spent 90 percent of your data__\n\n&gt; Nephew: Don’t look at me. I have only chatted with friends on WhatsApp, and I doubt it has used much data except for a couple of pictures I have shared.\n\n\nThen it suddenly dawns on me. They have been spending nearly 4 weeks abroad and taking a ton of pictures and videos with their mobile devices . And guess what the devices do when they get on a WiFi connection? Start taking backup and uploading to the cloud!\n\n\n*ding* New text message:\n\n__You have spent 100 percent of your data. Connection speed will be reduced to x kB__\n\n\nSo for me it became a very offline Christmas, but it was really great to see my sister and her family again :-)\n\nTL;DR: My sister and nephew uses up all my remains 4G data for December because their mobile devices backup photos and videos once they got on a WiFi connection.",
