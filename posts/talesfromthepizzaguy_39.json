Ugh.\n\nSometimes I absolutely hate this job, sometimes I love it.  I deliver almost always at night (closer on weekends) and I like the adventure that comes with it.  I've gotten lost in the basements of hospitals late a night.  I've delivered to a dark and closed retirement home in the middle of the night.  I also had quite a few dangerous deliveries.  Sometimes I wonder if this is how a drug dealer feels.  I also often listen to Art Bell reruns when delivering to add more suspense.  It can be fun for someone who likes adventure.\n\nI'm still going because I need the money, despite getting multiple raises at my main job.  Don't know when I'll quit.  Just got to keep delivering the dough to make the dough.\n\nAnyone else been doing this for longer than they expected?",

Once it kind of started slowing down, my co-worker goes on one of his last runs for his rush shift. An apartment complex. \n\nHe's gone for the longest time, he ended up calling the store once to see if the address was correct, and once more to see if we could get ahold of them because he can't find their address and they won't pick up. We try calling, and still no answer. So we call him back and say sorry dude just come back and we'll take care of it. \n\n\"Oh never mind I saw the guy hanging outside of the address, he came up to me and said it was his and signed for it and everything.\"\n\nCool, problem solved.\n\nCut to 15 minutes after closing time and we get a phone call from a woman who is absolutely pissed, wondering where the hell her pizza is, she's been waiting forever, she better get something for free, etc. We tell her we already delivered it, and it was signed for and everything. She's s yelling about how we better have it out to her ASAP or get something for free next time. Our ovens are shut off and all the drivers have already cashed out for the night, so we gave her a credit to her account and apologized. \n\nWhat's really funny, is if this really did happen, the thief tipped him 2 bucks for the whole order. Like, if you were gonna do that, why not put an awesome tip on there? Not that it would've mattered because he couldn't claim a tip after that anyways but I just thought that was comical. Either it was a stolen pizza or the customer pulled a fast one on us.",

But last weekend I had several timed orders totaling about 60 pies over the span of an hour and a half - starting before we were open and ending during the peak of my normal Friday lunch rush.\n\nNeedless to say, I was busy as hell (manager, if you didn't see my flair).  I came in really early and stretched all the pizzas.  My driver came in half an hour early to take the first order as it was for as soon as we open.\n\nAnyway, after the chaos the driver hands me $30 and tells me to take it since I busted my ass so she could take all the timed orders (she made $150+ on just the timed orders).  I told her to keep it, I didn't feel right taking it since I'm the GM and make a salary, not that I wouldn't have liked the extra cash (and I did bust my butt making those pies + all the normal orders we had).\n\nI've had a similar situation back when I was just a shift manager and we had a 200 pie order.  Driver split the tip with the inside staff and I did take it then since I was lower on the totem pole and felt I did do most of the work in that case.\n\nGot me thinking - What do other stores/drivers do when there's a large order like that?  Do you share your wealth with the inside staff when it comes to large orders/tips?",

Everything was fine until 9pm, when all of a sudden I felt the car sputtering out. I was able to get it to the side of the road, before it completely died. The next hour of my night, I was off and on the phone with my boyfriend, my store, and Triple A. I ended up just punching out at 9:30 and waiting for the tow truck. Now we have both of our cars in the shop and none for me to go to work in.",

Of course, I dismissed it right quick when I actually started delivering when I realized that right after people place their order do they decide how much to tip the driver or stiff them entirely. But is this true for anyone else? I've been delivering pizzas for a year and a half and I can't say that the time it took me to get from the store to the customer equated me a better tip than if I had gotten there late. If anything, the only reward I get for getting there fast was a verbal remark \"DAMN YOU GOT HERE QUICK\" or something to that effect. \n\nBut of course, this only equates from what I've seen and possibly my part of the country. If anyone's really gotten a better tip for getting there quicker, by all means share if you like.",

She asked me to take and hide her credit card so she couldn't order any more, but first she orders one last pizza. Well, pizzas, because she there was the deal at the time that if you ordered one you got another one, or half off, or something like that. So she would eat one pizza, then put the other one in the kitchen to eat the next day (not even refrigerate). Well we have another night where she's just complaining to us and saying she's out of control, etc. She is really torn up. She leaves so my other roommate is like, well I guess we should throw away her other pizza she's saving, shouldn't we? I was like, I have no idea, if you want to that's your decision. Pizza girl was L.I.V.I.D. \"YOU THREW AWAY A PERFECTLY GOOD PIZZA. HOW COULD YOU DO THAT. IT WAS PERFECTLY GOOD.\"\n\nThere were clearly some depression issues because she started living out of the living room, never left the living room, had the TV blaring all day, even at night she would leave it on.\n\nWhat would a driver make of something like this? Just happy to have a regular or at some point would they be like.. wtf. Obviously it was never on them to say something, just do their job, and I think she seemed normal and really nice when she answered the door.\n\nMy other friend and I used to joke that, whatever happened to her, a pizza delivery guy would find her when she died because that is how much she got pizza.\n\nI have no idea if she tipped well.",

        "text": "So I was just recently promoted to management, and most of my shifts are in the next town over, though I do still do some driving and management shifts at my original store. The other night I was at the new store, where I'm still learning the roads, regular customers, and amounts of orders we get each day.\n\nWell, on this night, things were going pretty smoothly. My drivers were doing very well, and customer satisfaction was high. There weren't too many orders, so the night was pretty relaxed, and there was a bit of a drizzle outside.\n\nThen my driver came back from a delivery rather pissed off. He explained to me that he had knocked on the door for five minutes, called the customer three times, and waited another five minutes before leaving. I voided the order for him and thought it might have just simply been a prank order.\n\nLo and behold, about 15 minutes later we got a call into the store from a disgruntled customer, who sounded like a middle-aged woman who was slightly intoxicated. No big deal, it's nighttime, she might've just had a few drinks or a glass of wine. She asked where the pizza was, and I explained my driver tried to get it to them for about 10 minutes. She denied he ever came, repeated her address so I could confirm it (we had it right), and asked for free pizza. I told her I could remake her order and have it sent out as soon as possible. I heard an exasperated sigh from the receiver, \"But I want something else! I want two large meats pizzas!\" As she had originally ordered mediums, I explained that I sadly could not give her different pizzas for a higher value for free. She simply said, \"Fucker,\" and hung up.\n\nFive minutes later, a web delivery comes through for the same address for two meats pizzas. I made them, boxed them, and sent them out with the same driver, who returned about 40 minutes later even more upset than before. He had knocked for five minutes, called five times, knocked for five more minutes, and then decided to call it quits as the rain began to pick up a bit. I voided it again, told him I'd give him some extra mileage for driving all the way there and back twice.\n\n15 minutes later, the phone rang again, \"Thank you for calling Papa John's, this is Schelander, how can I help you?\" It was the lady again. This time she sounds much more under the influence, this time sounding like she was doing a bit more than drinking. She was wailing, crying, and screaming saying, \"I want my pizza now! I've ordered twice and I just want my food! I'm soooo hungry and I don't get why you guys hate me!\"\n\nI assured her we did not hate her, and that I could give her a quality guarantee for the trouble she had gone through. At this point, I only had one driver, and he had three deliveries to go on already. After she pleaded through  tears and yelling, I told her that I could have it delivered to her, but it would take an hour and a half to two hours to get there, even though that would put us an hour and a half after closing time. \"I don't care how long it takes! I want my food! Where's your manager?\"\n\n\"I am the manager. I'm trying my hardest to comply to your demands, and if it's not enough, I can give you the website address to place a complaint. In the meantime, let me take your order so I can get it out to you as soon as possible.\"\n\nShe started telling me what she wanted (which was different from the past two orders she had already placed), before hanging up mid-call. I was already sketched out from how she was acting, so I didn't attempt to call her back.\n\nManagement is tricky.",

During my order the woman over the phone was rude, *really* rude, to the point where I beleive they just didn't care. I've had bad experiences at this Papa Gino's before, but nothing bad enought to never make me order again, also each time the people were at least respectful so it wasn't completely horrible. Yesterday was different.\n\nI ordered the pizza at around 12:30 and they told me there would be an hour and thirty minute wait. Ok, fair enough, I wasn't doing anything so I could wait.\n\nFast foward to 2 o'clock and the pizza is not here. That's fine, I've worked in restaurants before, I completely understand how overwhelmingly busy those places can get. Let alone a pizza place that has to deal with constant deliveries. I decided to give it thirty minutes. They must have been busy, considering there initial wait time was above an hour!\n\nWell it's 3 o'clock, now an hour late and no sign of the pizza guy. Now I'm a little annoyed, but I'm not the type of person to call and complain. The pizza guy shows up about twenty minutes later, so I get over it. This guy was polite about it, apologized for the wait and told me I didn't need to tip him. I did anyway, I gave him 15%. I understand that it's not usually the pizza guys fault.\n\nOnce I finally ate the pizza though, I wasn't happy. It was very cold, so I don't think they cared much to get it to me. If it was fresh out of the oven I would've thought they just had a full schedule, but it being cold just seems to exhibit lackadaisical service.\n\nAnyone know any policies for this at Papa Gino's? What should I've done in this situation? Does anyone know what must have gone wrong in the process?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses guys. I appreciate it. I managed to get reimbursed and I can get a free pizza.   \n ",

However 2 weeks in it is continuing.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the new hire and their SO have been being buddy-buddy with upper management. I have been asked to hang out after work, but I declined because I prefer to keep work and personal interactions separate. The new driver managed to get more hours than both me and another driver that have been there longer next week. I'll give it the benefit for a single week, if it continues I'm looking for different work. I thought the clique shit wouldn't be an issue here, but I'm afraid it is becoming one.",

        "text": "I'll start by saying, yeah, we have it pretty cushy as drivers at our store.  We even have a salad maker.  This person, like all cooks, is to prioritize orders in this way:\n\n1.  In house\n2.  Carry out\n3.  Delivery\n\nThis is the system, I totally get it, and it works great (when it's followed).  Here is how our top hours and supposed strongest salad maker prioritizes her tags/work *and* how she trains new people:\n\n1.  In house\n2.  Carry out\n3.  Prep\n4.  Slowly walk dirty dishes to the back\n5.  Help/talk to someone in another department\n6.  More prep\n7.  Brand new in house salad tags\n8.  Brand new carry out salad tags\n9.  More prep\n10. Hmm, yeah, must be about time to make 20 fucking premade salads\n11. Delivery tags (once it's clear I'm about to have an aneurysm)\n\nThis is even when it's not busy, and there are maybe two total delivery tags.  I have nights where (again, not busy) my hot food beats my salads out on every single order.  I ask a manager to have her make it, she gives me a little of the old \"broken English attitude\" and the salad that took her 20 fucking seconds to make is out and I'm on my way.  I'll gladly jump in there and make them, sure, but make that the policy.  And if I see hot chicken sealed in a plastic salad container for delivery one more time I'm gonna pop a blood vessel in my eye.\n\nI'm thinking of typing out something similar to this but without the cussing and maybe keeping the references to me about to have an aneurysm or pop a blood vessel.\n\nLastly, before you randomly accuse me of being lazy with zero knowledge of my work ethic, obviously I'm managing my time and making myself useful while I \"wait.\"  But once the hot foot is out I just lose my mind.  I think I really just needed to rant, and what better audience?  Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit:  ACTUAL lastly, if you think I'm being discriminatory or racist, I'm nearly 100% fluent in Spanish, and every Spanish speaker there loves me.  Except, obviously, her.",

I had a bad phone number and no access code, so it became undeliverable, oh well. At the building next door, a guy from Dominos had the same problem. After declaring the delivery a dead drop, he went to his car, put the pizza box on top of the car, and called up his store as you do in events such as these. He forgot about the pizza on his roof, and I laughed as I watched it slide down his rear window onto the street as he drove off to who knows where. Now I had a choice, I could return the bag to the store and be a good angel, or keep the bag and eat Dominos at my Pizza Hut store. Latter was tempting, but I went with the former.\n\nI stopped by the Dominos on my way back to home base. It wasn't that far, just three blocks from our undeliverable. Being the smart ass I am, I slipped in a \"Pizza Hut is hiring\" flyer in the bag, entered the competing establishment, and bellowed, \"I got a delivery for Dominos from Pizza Hut!\" \n\nThey got their bag back. The driver who lost it will never live this down, at least in my mind.\n\nTL;DR : Read it you lazy bum.",

After getting out of my car I realized the place didn't have a front porch at all, it was designed so the front door was in a kind of courtyard between the house and the garage with a hallway leading to it.\n\nI walked down the dark hallway to a tall wooden gate leading to the small courtyard, there was no doorbell near the gate so you would have to open it to get to the front door. Only problem was there was no handle on the gate either, it was one of those latches you had to reach between the boards to open the gate. I didn't see the latch at a glance so I peeked over the top of the fence and saw a clear plastic tarp on one of the walls in front of a sliding glass door.\n\nThe tarp had blood sprayed on it and the silhouette of a guy standing there with a knife. He didn't move at all and I didn't think he saw me, of course I was sure he didn't see me a second later when I realized it was all paint. I eventually got to the front door and the customer explained it was a Halloween decoration they hadn't gotten around to taking down, I just wasn't expecting a Halloween prop in January.",

        "text": "Today I learned the downside of having a workplace that's so tight-knit. In the 2 years and few months I've worked at Pizza Hut, everyone has gotten along with everyone else so well that we really have considered each other to be our best friends. Even with a decent amount of people coming and going, everyone's managed to stay in touch for the most part. We frequently hang out outside of work, and when we have days off and have nothing better to do, we come to Pizza Hut sometimes just to keep everyone who's working there that night company. Anyway, last night, two of our shift managers finally had enough of the way things have been run at the store lately (lots of equipment breaking with nothing done about it, general manager working fewer hours and not being helpful when she's here, etc). They both left their resignation letters and manager keys in the back, and quit on the spot. Two of our cooks decided if both of them are gone, they have no interest working here either, and the only shift manager left says he's going to quit if our GM makes him cover all of the shifts of the two managers that just quit. If he quits, his girlfriend quits, so we don't have a server. Our two remaining cooks say they probably won't have any interest working here if all of our shift managers are gone, and the last of our cooks quitting made one of our really valuable drivers quit. By a horrible coincidence, one of our new drivers walked out on us last night because he didn't want to do dishes (I was actually really glad to see him leave). This means it's just me, three other drivers, and the GM, who accepted another job offer which starts in a week, and as far as I know, nobody has found a GM to replace her. So essentially, the store's gone to shit overnight, and this might be the end of an extremely positive job experience. I'm pretty bummed, but I'm optimistic that I can find another decent delivery job somewhere else in my town if things stay miserable here. One of my close friends still works there, so I might be able to tolerate it for a while. I'm just shocked more than anything by how fast things went from perfectly fine to a complete mess.",

I felt prompted to write this because a customer I delivered to last night just called me, after sending me a text, which I ignored. \n\nWe call all customers who have security codes, or gates, or if we're just lost, as every few addresses aren't even posted on some streets. I didn't realize it would be an issue, but I'm one of the few female drivers at our store, and I guess people don't see that often. After almost every shift, I have at least one man calling to invite me over after work, or the next day calling to ask whether I'm single. I'm not freaking Gisele, where they'd regret not taking a chance. That baffles me. \n\nDoes this happen to you? I have NEVER thought it would be appropriate to call my delivery person's personal cell phone after a transaction. When it happens, I usually lie and say I'm married, because the term \"boyfriend\" doesn't imply permanence, and it makes it less embarrassing for the customer than just telling them it's strange to call. For the polite calls, I've said \"I appreciate the compliment, but I'm married,\" and then I end the call. For the pushy ones, I've informed them that it's inappropriate, and if it happens again I'll let my manager know and notate it on their account. \n\nBut seriously, what in the fuck? I don't want to bother getting a google voice account, because I'm lazy and obviously just use my main icon. I'm not looking for solutions, more just commiseration. Have you been called, or have you called a driver for personal reasons? Did it work out the way you wanted it to?",

At the beginning of this year I caught a job with Dominoes at a franchise store. All I wanted was 5 or 6 hours a day, and no closing. I made the mistake during my first week to mention that I could close once in a while. \nAlmost 5 months later I close 5 to 6 nights a week and still work during the day. \nA month ago I told my manager that I didn't want to close anymore and he took me off the schedule completely. At the time I didn't have another job lined up. So I relented, and went back to work...closing. \nMy pay is $8.05 in store and $5.05 plus tips while on the road, and $0.85 per delivery. My average mileage per week is around 750 miles. My delivery area is about 7 or so square miles. My average tips per night is between $35 to $55. I spend around $80 in fuel cost per week, sometimes less. My pay check (every two weeks) is for about $565 for around 60 or so hours a week.  Finally, I work from 4pm to 2am and sometimes 4am. \nI figured out a month ago that with vehicle depreciation and vehicle upkeep. I'm honestly only making about $9 an hour. \nToday I was hired on to a new job where I don't drive my own vehicle. I'm paid $9 per hour plus tips. And I only work open to close two days a week. But this time the restaurant closes at 12, at the latest. I'm guaranteed 40 hrs a week! \n\nWith that said, last week my manager changed policy and no longer allows us drivers to give dip cups, park packs or pep packs for free. That is how most drivers get our working class customers (I.e.  see also inner city suburb) to tip us.  It costs the store $62.50 in food costs for one case of dip cups. What's worse is both pizza slut and papa John's give away garlic butter cups standard with their pies. Even the little no-name mom and pop shops give out \"freebies\" to their customers.  Tips dropped about $15 to $20 across the board.  It took about two weeks for business to drop off. We went from the busiest store in the franchise to just another average store. When I brought this up to my manager, I was told to accept it or get out. \nThe question is should I \"mike drop\" by bringing this up to the franchise owner, or just dip out? What do you think?\n\n(I apologize for any and all mistakes.)\n\nThanks for the great advice from my fellow drivers. Normally I would just walk/quit but after lurking here for the last 2 yrs, I feel I should watch out for the next driver. \nWhat I have learned, no \"mike drop\", talk to owner of franchise, and have another job lined up.  \nP.s. thanks for listening/reading and letting me vent. This helped me.",

Last year I was \"Promoted\" to Assistant Manager and I stuck it out because the GM was a great guy and I wanted to help him out, and once we got more managers, he put me back on driving as a \"back up\" manager which was fine. I wouldn't manage too often, like once a week or so, maybe more if a manager called out, or another store needed help. Anyways that GM got promoted, and now we have a new guy who sorta sucks, and with the way things are going, I feel like I'm going to be asked to manage alot more, and the thing is I really dont want to. I dont enjoy doing triple the work for a fraction of the pay, and since I don't like this GM like my last one, I'm not as eager to give up the higher pay, especially since I just recently moved to my first apartment. I'm considering applying to Pizza Hut since there is one right down the street from my new Apartment and the guy who delivered my last pizza said they're a pretty busy store, and they're gonna be hiring soon. My biggest concern is hours though. At Dominos I get 40 hours a week easy, even back when I was just a driver. I heard that PH drivers only get about 30 hours max, can anyone confirm this? Also any imput on PH vs Dominos would be appreciated. ",

We had a significant walk in presence today (mostly due to several differing soccer teams walking in.) We had 6 Drivers scheduled but 2 of us were forced into taking and handing out orders for these walk ins for the bulk of our dinner rush. One of our Drivers had accrued somewhere in the vicinity of $30 just from these teams tipping him for taking their orders and using varying coupon techniques to save them a ton of money on their orders. Our management forced those team members to put those tips in a 'pool'.\n\nThis a regular occurrence and we normally don't make a stink about it because we are reminded on a regular basis that it is 'Policy' yet none of us have received or signed any documentation detailing this.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As I'm sure you know, working as a driver puts a lot of stress on your car. Coupled with a lot of my colleagues being in that stage of life when they think they are the best driver bar none, a good number of them are on their second car since we have been working together. Hold on to that thought.\n\nLately we've been getting strict about enforcing our delivery area. It's always been marked on the map on a wall in our store, in big, purple, dashes, but a couple of months ago a new store opened up that completely took control of our long-range delivery area to the north of our store (long range being where we would get double gas money for that drop), and so we took it as an opportunity to re-establish our boundary. Hold that thought too.\n\nTo the east of our store, we have our last remaining long-range delivery area. Outside of this are a couple of 'international schools', where kids come over from the States and Asia, for \"culture\" and reasons. We had always delivered to these schools; they were quite a bit further than our marked delivery area, but there was no other Domino's nearer, and the students were collectively regular customers, so it was tolerated. And because we delivered to these locations, it only seemed fair to deliver to anywhere that was on or just off the main road to them. Because the British are like that. Hold *that* thought.\n\nWith the reestablishment of the delivery boundaries, most of the drivers understood this to mean \"we don't deliver anywhere past this line\". This includes the schools, and those on the route towards them. So we started to refuse delivery to all of these addresses. The franchisee panicked and sent our store manager to say to the schools, no, actually we are still delivering to you, and here are some vouchers to sweeten the deal. But we're not delivering to anything *else* outside our boundary. \n\nThis left our delivery area looking something like a lava lamp with two stray bubbles.\n\nSo we have - heavy wear on cars, confusion over the boundaries, and now a strange, but strictly established, boundary line...and bubbles.\n\nStill with me? Well done. Because that's all just background to this one call I get today.\n\nA lady rings up and, surprise surprise, orders some food, gives me her address, and says she'll pay at the door.\n\nIt's only after I hang up that I twig that her address is outside of our delivery area. It's one of a few roads in an otherwise rural route to the schools, so it's obvious we don't go there.\n\nI have the grim task of calling back, and informing her. Of course she's not happy. To placate her, I 'talk to the manager' a couple of times while she's on the line, and finally negotiate the driver meeting her in the car park of a pub that's just inside the boundary.\n\nShe's still trying to send me on an overnight guilt trip, though, and mentions casually that 'I had a delivery just last week', and that 'the guy with blond hair that has a BMW always brings it here all the time!'\n\nIt's at this point I feel a can of whoop ass jiggling away in my pocket.\n\nWhy? There's only been one BMW in our drivers' fleet in the time I've been working, and yes, a blond guy did drive it. Problem is, he hasn't driven it for months!\n\nFor the purposes of professionalism, I didn't let on that she'd rumbled her own fib, but I did ask the driver who took the drop, if he could ask her just how long ago the blond haired Beemer driver brought her last delivery.",

I get £0.90 ($1.30) per delivery for petrol (gas) for most deliveries (less than 4 miles), with some supplementary pay for really long journeys (up to 15 miles). \n\nI probably make on average £3 ($4.30) per night in tips.\n\nI understand more so in the US, speaking about your pay is more 'taboo' but if anyone is willing to tell me I would be interested.
