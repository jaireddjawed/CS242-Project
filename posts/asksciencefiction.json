[{"title":"[Subreddit Business] New Automod Warnings on Posts","author":"Vote_for_Knife_Party","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/y158i3\/subreddit_business_new_automod_warnings_on_posts\/","text":"Greetings, everyone.\n\nFor a while now, we have been using the automod to attach announcements to questions where we felt it worthwhile to remind the users of a particular set of rules, or suggest to posters that particular questions might fit better somewhere else. Due to the nature of automatic moderation, these announcements have not always been perfectly applied, sometimes prompting warnings of a nonsensical nature (as seen by anyone who has had a Star Wars warning pop up in a discussion of Watchmen because Doctor Manhattan was mentioned in the title). Additionally, there has been efforts to reduce more general offenses, such as doylist responses to questions, which are against both the spirit and rules of the sub. On more than one occasion we've given a temp ban, only for the banned individual to either A) claim to not know what \"doylist\" is or B) state that they're a regular user but forgot where they were at. While Scenario A is not great (one really should read the rules), the \"Eternal September\" nature of the modern internet means that this sort of thing is unavoidable, especially given that the shift from \"Old Reddit\" to \"New Reddit\" has put the sidebar and it's summation of the rules out of sight from many users. Scenario B isn't great either, but is an understandable mistake, especially if a person is subscribed to multiple fandom\/fiction related subs that don't have an enforced watsonian\/doylist split.\n\nIn an attempt to address both the misapplied warnings on the system end, and the oversight\/mistakes on certain user ends, we will be replacing the individual context-driven automod warnings with a single, universal automod message to be applied to all posts. This message will address core tenets of posting on the sub, warn of areas of enhanced enforcement, and warn\/remind anyone wandering in that things here are a bit different on some other subs.\n\nIf there are any concerns or issues with this warning, please post them here or using modmail.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1665483130.0},{"title":"[Mandalorian] Why do people still use coins as currency instead of digital currency?","author":"rustyyryan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11q282t\/mandalorian_why_do_people_still_use_coins_as\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678689235.0},{"title":"[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory] Did the Oompa Loompas write and practice their songs?

However Hogwarts Legacy comes out and one of the main characters early on in the game is a student who transferred from Uagadou in Uganda and states they dont use wands at all. Natsai goes on to say when asked that magic is not any weaker when used without a wand. \n\nUagadou is also described as the largest wizarding school in the world so if they teach wandless magic with no issues why dont more users we see use wandless magic. The only downsides I can see to wandless magic is it says its difficult to learn but if the largest school teaches it to kids then why not use it as a standard.\n\nThinking wider this would improve the wizarding worlds defence not having to carry around a wand which can easily be disarmed. Also the more sinister characters could be far more subtle not having to use a wand. \n\nThe only reason i can see, but its a strange one, is that its a conspiracy to keep the Olivanders in business. No wands would mean no Olivanders and it would be sad to see a historic family business end. But this also begs the question what is the purpose of wand cores as well as they act differently but spells can be cast without a wand to the same effect.\n\nPlease can someone with more knowledge in the universe pick answer please as i will be honest i am not a massive fan of the franchise but with my limited knowledge and the Internets help this is really bugging me i cant find an answer","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678556135.0},{"title":"[DC] If there is an Anti-Life equation, are there other such equations with similar effects?","author":"SuperStarPlatinum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11okwrc\/dc_if_there_is_an_antilife_equation_are_there\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678543237.0},{"title":"[Wreck-It Ralph] Anyone else remember King Candy?","author":"FacelessPoet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11oicxx\/wreckit_ralph_anyone_else_remember_king_candy\/","text":"When I was a boy, I used to play a game called 'Sugar Rush' on a local arcade store.

Dumbledore considered this decision unwise because, as a living being, Nagini could think and act for herself. I would argue living horcruxes have a far greater weakness: living things tend to die.\n\nObviously, we know this happened to Nagini when Neville decapitated her with the sword of Gryffindor. However, we know the sword of Gryffindor to be capable of destroying horcruxes. My question then becomes\u2026 could Nagini have died in any other way? Say that she was never threatened with horcrux-killing weapons\u2026 would she have ever died of natural causes? Or was she functionally immortal, outside of weapons like the sword?\n\nThere is at least some source material evidence suggesting functional immortality. The Fantastic Beasts films show us that Nagini is at least 70 years old\u2026 pretty ancient for a snake (though obviously within the normal age range of a human, which is where she started). We can also infer that Voldemort likely wouldn\u2019t have wanted to bet his immortality on a being he didn\u2019t expect to live indefinitely.\n\nBut this is, of course, speculation. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know: Would Nagini ever die of old age? Illness? If no, could two wizards theoretically achieve shared immortality by making each other their horcruxes? If yes, what would happen after the death of Nagini\u2019s body? Would the Voldemort soul fragment die? If it survived (without a host\/vessel), would Nagini\u2019s soul remain earthbound as well, as it shared a body with the Riddle fragment?

He just stops caring about people, he starts letting people suffer just because he might be able to save Padm\u00e9.\n\nPalpatine has not proved this ability to him. This guy is a Sith Lord which Anakin just discovered, he is a Sith Lord so for all Anakin knows he\u2019s probably lying about the fact he could apparently save Padm\u00e9 just to lie so he doesn\u2019t get killed.

Palpatine doesn\u2019t turn Anakin enough. Because it is just like Anakin with what he has been given once Palpatine says he is the Sith Lord, Anakin should either 1. Kill him 2.

In the books, off the top of my head, there is the fight in the department of secrets and the fight when the death eaters infiltrate Hogwarts to kill dumbledore and in both of these encounters, death eaters curse or jynx good guy characters with things that are only an inconvenience and there is no explicit reason why they wouldn't just want to kill them because if they survive, they can get in their way later either directly or by helping harry. Neville gets hit with something that makes his legs move uncontrollably in the department of mysteries and Ron gets hit with something that makes him act drunk or high or whatever and Hermione gets hit with something that knocks her unconscious. In the second encounter I used as an example similar things happen, although no specific examples come to mind of what curses were used. All they are doing by not using the killing curse on anyone they don't have an explicit reason to leave alive is leaving the possibility of allowing that person to create problems for them again later on.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678321749.0},{"title":"[Marvel\/DC] Let's say i'm a genius with a common sense handicap, and I decide to give a Kryptonian Captain America's super-soldier serum.

'Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly!'\n\nBut was he telling the truth? When he faces the Balrog on the bridge, he doesn't bust out any wizard magic that no one else could have used. Instead, he duels it in an ordinary sword fight:\n\n> From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.\n\n> Glamdring glittered white in answer.\n\n> There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back, and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.\n\n> 'You cannot pass!' he said.\n\nAdmittedly, the way Gandalf wins the fight is by magically shattering the bridge and dropping the Balrog into the chasm. However, that's still a mundane means and not something that could only have been done with magic. A trap that triggered, say, a rockslide that destroyed the bridge should have worked just as well.\n\nPlus, when Gandalf returns and describes how he slew the Balrog, it seems he still just used his sword to do it:\n\n> We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels.\n\nSo why did Gandalf's Maiar status matter to this fight? Could any skilled fighter with an elf-made weapon have done the same, or is there something intrinsic about the Balrog that only a being of equal or greater metaphysical status could have defeated it?","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678287766.0},{"title":"[Star Wars & Foundation] Because of plate tectonics, isn\u2019t a \u201ccyber world\u201d like Coruscant or Trantor impossible?","author":"JamersonRosenstein","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11m878a\/star_wars_foundation_because_of_plate_tectonics\/","text":"When I read of these ten thousand year old high tech galactic empires that have planets that are completely built up under hundreds of layers of infrastructure and buildings, such that there is almost no nature left on the surface, the first thing I think of it \u201cbut what about plate tectonics?\u201d\n\nSeems like you could never have stability in such a planetary construction because things would move and eventually fail, given a long enough timeline.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678309668.0},{"title":"[ DND ] Has there every been a equivalent to a character multiclassing every class level 20?","author":"Nameguy1234567","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11mcz9s\/dnd_has_there_every_been_a_equivalent_to_a\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678320771.0},{"title":"[DCEU] Why did Silvana get sent to Rock Falls instead of Iron Heights?","author":"Talia_Nightblade","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11mszgp\/dceu_why_did_silvana_get_sent_to_rock_falls\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678370549.0},{"title":"[AtLA\/LoK] After losing her connection to the past Avatars at the and of S2, could Korra still speak with them if she found them in the Spirit World?","author":"Alert_Confusion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11mcgse\/atlalok_after_losing_her_connection_to_the_past\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678319508.0},{"title":"[Star Wars] how can a moon have similar surface gravity to its host planet?","author":"ReserveMaximum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskScienceFiction\/comments\/11mb9v9\/star_wars_how_can_a_moon_have_similar_surface\/","text":"In Star Wars The Clone Wars, and in The Mandalorian the planet Mandalore and it\u2019s moon Concordia are both inhabited worlds that humans walk around on freely with no huge differences noticeable in the gravitational field compared to galactic standard.

This is an interesting point, because it raises the question: Why doesn't the state just execute them?\n\nBatman doesn't kill people, and that explains why the villains he's caught are still alive after he defeats them, but why, after they have been arrested and then escaped a comical amount of times, has the government simply not given many of them the death penalty?

The only time he uses the Iron Lad suit is *before* he gets to the present day, and he never joins the Young Avengers.\n\nSo what's the deal here? What happened to his time as Iron Lad? I see two possibilities:\n\n**1) The Kang in this series is not Main Kang, but merely a divergent version.**\n\nThe problem with this is that in the *Timeless* (2021) oneshot, Main Kang references his time in the Cretaceous as a child, which was only in KOMTC. Therefore, it stands to reason that KOMTC Kang must be Main Kang.\n\n**2) Young Avengers Iron Lad is a divergent version.**\n\n The only real problem with this is that the Marvel wiki lists Iron Lad as being the same-universe (6311) version as Main Kang, though they could be wrong as a wiki. \n\nThis would bother me though, because I always thought Iron Lad was the most interesting part of Kang's history as this tragic hero doomed to turn into a villain down the line no matter how hard he tried.
