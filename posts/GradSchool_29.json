I've relied on federal loans this whole time and now i'm completely at a loss. Its been a hard two years and i don't have the credit score right now to qualify for private loans (i tried).

I have more life demands now, struggle with some depression, and find it difficult to stretch my mind the way they expect in “top students”. This makes me feel I don’t belong, even though I have the practical skills for social work. Fortunately, I’m not interested in a PhD. (Though, I would go back for Clinical Psyc, but I feel these marks would not be competitive enough for that). \n\nHow do people manage their imposter syndrome?

Moved full time as an assistant professor in 2018 after I almost killed myself from that mentor, my other PI at northeastern was extremely supportive. Anyways, established a lab, very successful in teaching, was promised tenure very soon, managed the online phase during the pandemic. Cancer in 2020 😞 kept working because i can't live on medical leave salary with family to support. Eventually had to quit in 2021. Now all recovered but still no confidence and shattered from what happened to me all over the years. How can i get back? I want to get a master in nanoscience and a PhD. I feel way far behind because of those 1.5 years off work to recover. I feel they will be another year because i am late now to apply anywhere in Europe or US. I know it's dumb question but consider it venting. Also, I don't want to work in nanoscience just with my MD and postdoc experience, it is very shaky and I feel very insecure even when i had a lab and won grants.",

I know that you need at least like a 2.8 \\~ 3.0 (B- to B area) avg in order to not get kicked out of the program. Obviously I know that grad courses are hard, but how hard are they? Are they like \"impossible\" level compared to undergraduate courses, just a bit harder, or do they just differ by the grad school? Is there a way I could possibly prepare beforehand?\n2. Is it possible to maintain a work life balance studying biochem? I know this mostly depends on the PI but do a lot of them \"pressure\" you to stay more hours?\n3. Is it better to talk to the professor or the students in order to get a good view on the grad school environment (so should I talk to the lab professor or the students in that lab to better get a view of how my life would be like)?\n\nThanks a lot!",

I had to throw away some expired lab works he had done when he was gone over the break last year. \n* cutting me off while I m talking. \n* the worst one of all is that when I am talking with my PI with my thesis and/or company projects whose designs I make 100%, he somehow inserts himself in the conversation and says shit like \"exactly,\" even though he doesn't help with any of stuff I do. \n\nIt's hard to confront him  because he is from the same university as my professor's (yes, my PI has been recruiting from his university in his home country). I have a feeling that he tries to impress our PI, and I kinda get it but at the same time don't make it too overt.

Id rather let my GPA speak for itself than submit with a subpar GRE score. I’m getting strong letters of Rex from my professors and I’m involved in campus. I’m just really worried, sorry if this is a little rambly.",

I am much more focused on programming, my training has consisted of computational analysis, machine learning, computer vision and I have dabbled with Linux. My program is terribly toxic- I had major surgery this past year. My first advisor was completely absent, didn't come to work, and the group itself got very toxic. Men in the group would go out of their way to make the women uncomfortable and people didn't talk to each other. I switched groups last month hoping to keep with computation. Today during our group meeting I was presenting my work and my PI screamed at me in front of everyone because I showed a plot with no units. Every paper I looked at didn't have units on their plots because they were unitless. He started going off on me in front of everyone, saying that I know nothing and I clearly don't work and understand anything (I've been there a month), threatening my pay, and then forced me to present again later. I tried to find the appropriate units, but apparently didn't do it right and he screamed at me and told me I'm a waste of time and I should be ashamed for wasting everyone's time when I don't care. I tried to stop and just end the meeting, but then he went \"well I scheduled 20 minutes off now so we're going to use it. What was reference number 7 in the original paper about? What was the 2nd page of the 9th reference about? Are you going to get up on the board? You clearly didn't make any of this yourself, you screenshotted everything and have done nothing. (I literally had code open that generated those plots exactly and they don't match anything online) and he wouldn't stop screaming and yelling at me in front of everyone. I can't handle it anymore, what the fuck do I do? How the hell do I find any kind of tech work so I can just get the fuck out of this department, I am genuinely terrified.",

We went to a conference back in October and I was expected to drive my own car for the entire lab. I instead found super cheap plane tickets (80/piece) for everyone. It was a volunteer trip so no one was forced. I simply offered it as a solution and everyone in the lab liked the idea. However, my boss took this out on me because I \"changed her plans of using \\*my car\\* on the trip.\" I explained that I didn't want to use my car due to gas and putting a lot of miles on it (over 100k already and the conference was hours away, and I drive an hour to work and back each day). She said I should have just put up with it because the grant would've covered gas later (she ignored my comment on mileage). She said her graduate students come first and they shouldn't have had to pay for their tickets and that I should not have come/I don't belong in the lab, etc. I disagreed and said that everyone is an adult and had a choice to go or find alternative ways there. She then further fueled the fire by claiming I did nothing but shop at the conference (she ran into me at the conference and I had a small Marshalls bag that had a professional/business sweater in it for my volunteer shift). This comment she made was not true and it made me cry for weeks. I'm still not over it. I never had someone make a blatant allegation that wasn't true about me before right to my face, especially when I worked so hard at the conference volunteering, cleaning, and organizing the event. I was utterly shocked. \n\nI wanted to quit then, but I needed her recommendation for graduate school so I've hung on so far. The week the letter of recommendation was due (I sent her numerous reminders for 3 months) I was sick with covid and bedridden. She waited the DAY OF to submit it, a few hours before the deadline and again, I wanted to quit that day. A part of me thinks that she is mad at me because I didn't choose her lab (she wanted me to apply to hers instead). She knew the other P.I. in the lab I applied for, and said negative things about him. The other P.I when I met with him, however, said nothing but nice things about my current employer and was impressed that I was in her lab. My boss/PI also said that the PI that I applied for is not suited for my interests (the lab I applied for is in human dev and family sciences and I want to study OCD and habit formation in adolescents and this literally has never changed, its the WHOLE reason I'm putting up with all this to get experience and help kids/teens with OCD). I joined my current lab to get a better understanding of linear models so that someday maybe I can apply them to my ideas. She said with my skillset I MUST stick to cognitive psych/neuro. It was infuriating for her to try to tell me what I AM ALLOWED to pursue. \n\nFast forward to today... she insinuated that I was incompetent in my job and that I know nothing about basic MRI (this is untrue, as I do very well in my MRI course that I take with another professor at the same university, and I even work on 7T and 14T machines with him as a hobby daily). She dislikes that I spend time with this professor on my breaks because he's more into \"physics\" whereas I should only be interested in psychology, according to her. Personally, I just like to understand the machine in greater detail so that someday if I ever run my own MRI experiments, I know what to do and what the actual machine entails. I also LOVE collaborating with other people and their backgrounds - it is why I love science.\n\nLastly, she says that she's concerned because I never ask questions when I don't understand. This isn't true. I've asked questions a lot, but every time I do, she explodes and says that I should already know this material, or she says that I should \"just look it up on your own\" and when I do find a solution using online resources, she gets upset because it's not \"her way\" of doing it. For example, she was mad today because I use vi in Unix coding to create scripts, but she uses gedit. I asked what gedit was (I had no idea! Remember? I only know what the online resources tell me!) And she demeaned me for a solid twenty minutes over this. \n\nMy colleagues (we only have two other people in my lab and they are grad students under my boss) are already beginning to notice my disconnection from my work and are concerned for me and my well-being. They understand fully why I feel this way, as they often feel this too from her. This PI has lost a grad student, and a postdoc within the last year due to her rude, spiteful mannerisms. She also lost 2 other lab managers who quit abruptly before I started. I physically saw the post-doc drop everything in my lab, grab his stuff, and quit on the spot on a random Tuesday a few months back. My PI still blames everything on him (or me) even though he's gone! \n\nI feel that she is isolating me from other professors and creating a lot of self-esteem issues for me. The other professors I talk to genuinely like me and enjoy my ideas and always give me opportunities to stop by their labs. With them, I feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes, and learning. It's seriously the only thing keeping me sane each week.\n\nI cry on a daily basis, question my reality and feelings, and genuinely have no idea what to do. I feel like I cannot talk to her or be open with her, or explain these feelings. Grad decisions come out at the end of the month and I'm trying to hold on for dear life. Either way, I just need a good pep talk to be honest. I wish someone could remind me that I'm not a loser or idiot like she makes me feel. I don't want to feel alone in this.\n\nSigned,\n\nA very sad employee/scholar.",
