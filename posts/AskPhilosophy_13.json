        "text": " \n\nAristotle, in his work *Nicomachean Ethics,* attempts to extrapolate what the greatest virtue for human beings is. He himself reasons that in order to discover what this is, we must first understand what the human function is; what the function of a human being is. He comes to the conclusion that this is to “act well in accordance with reason.” This, he says, is the human function, and through it, we can find what the greatest virtue for mankind is. I however will make the case that Aristotle's argument is flawed. Aristotle's error lies in the reasoning he uses to find this “greatest virtue”, namely, that we must discover the so-called “human function.” I argue that his argument fails because his argument is not sufficient in establishing a link between the human function and the greatest virtue for human beings. Furthermore, I will argue that there exists no such thing as a human function upon which the basis of virtue and ethics can be established upon. \n\nTo begin, we must establish the root of Aristotles’ reasoning, from which, we can come to his conclusion independently. The root of his theory can be found early in his writing on (      ) where he says: “Every craft and every discipline, and likewise action and decision seems to seek some good” This sentiment is the basis of why Aristotle came to the conclusion that he did. Aristotle believes that for every action, there is an end that is meant to be met by that action. He uses the phrase “some good”, which I interpret as meaning “some result” rather than a good as in a moral good. Aristotle uses the example of a bridle maker; someone who makes bridles for horses. The bridle maker's entire craft exists for one reason: Because people ride horses. Thus, his craft (bridle making) seeks a good (allowing people to ride horses). This being the case, Aristotle says that bridle making is subordinate to horsemanship, and this same line of logic applies to almost every imaginable craft. He takes this idea and applies it to human beings. This quote illustrates his reasoning very clearly: “Then do the carpenter and the leatherworker have their/functions and actions, but has a human being no function? Is he by nature idle, without any function? Or, just as eye, hand, and foot, and, in general, every part apartantly has its function, may we likewise ascribe to a human being some function apart from all of these?” ( ) In essence, he postulates that if all other crafts and objects have a function: an eye, hand, and foot, then the human being must have a function too, and it must be a function that is *unique* to humans; not shared by any other living thing. This, to him, rules out the act of simply living and nutrition/growth, since these are shared with animals. Thus, he concludes on page ( ) that the “Remaining possibility, then, is some sort of life of action of the &lt;part of the soul&gt; that has reason.”(  ). This is the function argument of Aristotle. However, it is flawed in several important ways; flawed enough that the validity of the entire sentiment can be called into question. \n\nThe first objection that can be raised to his argument is quite evident as we can apparently use Aristotle's line of reasoning against him. It stems from Aristotle's statement in the quote mentioned above where he states that, since eyes, hands, and feet all have functions, that it follows that human beings must have a function as well. This seems to be quite an egregious logical fallacy; Aristotle seems to be drawing on a false equivalency here. It is unclear how, because my hand has a function, and my eyes have a function, that I Myself must have a function. I would argue that it is a fact that my eyeballs, hand, and foot are all completely useless without me. This is contrary to Aristotle's point however. My appendages do not have a function without me. They exist to serve me, I *give* them their function, and if you were to separate my hand from my body in a way that I could no longer impose my will upon it, it would cease to have a function. The same is true of any activity. A builder does not have a function unless there are humans who ask the builder to build, and a bridle maker does not have a function unless there are humans who ask him to make bridles so they can ride horses. My argument is that *we* ascribe functions to crafts, tools, and body parts, they do not have functions that reside within their very essence. Thus, the same must be true of human beings. We cannot have a function unless we are ascribed one. If I am a carpenter, my function is to be a carpenter, if I am a professor, my function is to be a professor. If I am driving, my function is to get to my location safely, etc. As my argument demonstrates, a human being can *adopt* a function, but there exists no unifying function of a human being. This being the case, Aristotle has made a false equivalency between tools, body parts, and crafts in comparing them to human beings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n An objection …",

Murder is illegal, because murder is bad, and we don't want people to murder\n\nHowever there are some things that are bad that aren't illegal, like cheating on your spouse. Most of us would say it's immoral to cheat, even though it's legal. \n\nOne explanation might be that the severity of the badness differs. Murder is definitely worse than cheating. However, there are things that are illegal that aren't as immoral as cheating - like jaywalking, shoplifting, and double parking.\n\nWhy is this? Why don't we outlaw all the things that are bad? Why doesn't legality match up closer to morality? Why is smoking indoors illegal, but breaking promises is legal? Are there extra considerations when determining if something should be outlawed beyond badness?\n\nCheers everyone!",

But are such views consistent with utilitarianism? It occurred to me that utilitarianism seems to support the Epicurean view of death, and that death can only be considered a harm if it harms the people who will grieve for the departed. So can death, and I don't mean the process of dying, be a harm to person who dies?",

Calculating machine made out of metal elements, slow and impractical but due to it's size, comparable in power to human brain.\n\nIf consciousness is emergent quality or product of algorithms running by it, can we say that this machine is self aware? Sounds preposterous. There are some theories though, according to which quantum effects or/and electromagnetic field is taking part in creating consciousness. They seems plausible to me but is there any  idea in philosophy about brain being a receiver for \"broadcast\" of consciousness?

Vigilance: You should always be alert for those who wish you harm. If somebody does harm to you, it is your fault for letting them close enough to do so. Offer no mercy, if somebody has harmed you in the past, they have shown you their true colors, it is on you to cast them out before they can perform greater harm. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\n2. Forgiveness: We are all imperfect beings who are forever growing. If somebody makes a mistake, we must treat it as a learning opportunity. If we judge people for their mistakes, we rob from them the opportunity to learn and grow from it. When you are struck, you should turn the other cheek.\n\nThe closest I can think of for an established philosophy for either of these would be a strict following of the Christian New Testament, but is that an established philosophy? Isn't that just Christianity?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I've been reading Derrida's \"Signature, Event, Context\", but got stuck on this section (below) where he tries to show how the absences that structure writing are part of all language in general. \n\nThe first paragraph I think I understand - the identity of a linguistic element is constituted by its difference from other elements, as according to Saussure, and this grants it a \"certain self-identity\" that allows it to be both recognised and repeated, part of what makes a language a language and writing writing. \n\nThe second paragraph is where I'm struggling. The identity of a word comes from its graphemes? What does he mean by \"unity of the signifying form constitutes itself by virtue of its iterability\"? - I understand iterability is a key part of writing, but I am unsure what he means by \"unity of the signifying form\" as well as how this relates specifically to language in general including oral speech. \n\nAnd how does the possibility of being separated from its referent make \"every mark, including those which are oral, a grapheme in general\"? He doesn't seem here to discuss the difference between speech and writing, only states that since speech also relies on graphemes/recognisable, iterable marks, it can also be divorced from its referent (how?)\n\nFinally, the last paragraph seems really crucial, but is barely explained. What does he mean by experience not consisting of presence? Just that for an experience to be specific it needs to be differentiatable from other experiences? \n\n**Section:**\n\n&gt; Let us consider any element of spoken language, be it a small or large unit... let us say that a certain self-identity of this element (mark, sign, etc) is required to permit its recognition and repetition. Through empirical variations of tone, of voice, etc., possibly of a certain accent, for example, we must be able to recognize the identity, roughly speaking, of a signifying form. \n\n&gt; Why is this identity paradoxically the division or dissociation of itself, which will make of this phonic sign a grapheme? Because this unity of the signifying form only constitutes itself by virtue of its iterability, by the possibility of being repeated in the absence not only of its “referent”, which goes without saying, but in the absence of a determinate signified or of the intention of actual signification, as well as of all intention of present communication. \n\n&gt; This structural possibility of being weaned from the referent or from the signified (and therefore from communication and its context) seems to me to make every mark, including those which are oral, a grapheme in general; that is, as we have seen, the nonpresent remainder [restance] of a differential mark cut off from its putative \"production\" or origin. \n\n&gt; And I shall extend this law to all \"experience\" in general if it is conceded that there is no experience consisting of pure presence but only of chains of differential marks.",

        "text": "I'm attempting to find a clear definition of morality and the terms related to it.\n\nAm I missing any information?:\n\n&gt;\"Good, bad, right, wrong, should/ought, and should/ought not\" work with respect to a particular goal or imperative (obligation). To say that someone should do something/ought to do something is to imply that they have reason to take a particular action.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Extrinsically, they generally refer to the efficiency of the steps taken to achieve said goal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Intrinsically, the goal is thought to be good in its own light, an “end in itself”; something acquired for its own sake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What is an imperative/goal?:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"If you are to bake a cake, you should turn on the oven/it is good to turn on the oven/it is right to turn on the oven.\" This is a *conditional* imperative, and works whether morality exists or not. It is dependent upon a singular person's present-moment desires. These are known as \"hypothetical\" imperatives. They are subjective, because not everyone desires to bake a cake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Moral realism refers to the existence of a \"categorical\" imperative, or an unconditional obligation. Think of it as a goal like above, but one which applies to everyone, unconditionally. That is not to say that the moral answer to a situation does not change depending on the context. The moral realist will claim that of course it does.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"You should not unnecessarily torture babies for fun.\" Note that this is a moral claim, because there was no \"if\" behind it. It is unconditional, and it is thought to outweigh one's *personal* goals in the *moment* of action. It supposedly applies whether the person wants to torture babies for fun or not.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The moral antirealist denies that the claim is correct, and that it only works when adding an \"if\" statement behind it. To the antirealist, changing it to \"If you don't want to harm babies, then you should not unnecessarily torture them for fun.\" corrects it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As an example, to the theist, the categorical imperative(s)/\"ultimate\" goal generally depends on God’s nature, and what glorifies him. The Utilitarian categorical imperative is to maximize happiness and minimize suffering. The Kantian categorical imperatives consist of acting in accordance with a maxim that which does not undermine itself when universalized to all rational beings, and to treat people as an end in themselves rather than a means to an end.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The moral realist generally argues that we can derive the categorical imperative from our capacity to reason, and the moral antirealist denies this.\n\nTo clear it up further, I believe that the moral antirealist generally has to agree with these three following claims:\n\n&gt;“Anyone else’s view on what is good, bad, right and wrong, is equally valid, sound, reasonable, and rational as mine, so long as it isn’t self-contradictory, no matter what it is.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"All moral lines are equally arbitrary. It is no more arbitrary to base moral value on a single strand of hair, than it is to base it on a being’s rationality, or even a being's capacity to feel. One could disvalue a skin color, biological sex, or nationality. All are equally justified.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, evil is as well. Thinking something evil makes it so. If someone believes it moral to murder, then it is for him, and he is justified in it.”\n\nIs there anything that I'm missing in my understanding of morality?",

I kind of doubt that Marx went around saying \"Good doesn't exist, and I know that\"; and as far as I know, Christian theology doesn't say that we all know God's plan and can therefore act in accordance with it - if anything, Christianity seems to suggest that we have free will, but that God's plan always happens.\n\nI don't see a conflict here, as Marx was not a theologian. Am I missing something?\n\nThanks.",

When I search for these terms, I mostly get links discussing the truth of evolutionary theory itself. \n\nMy thought is this: evolution selects for fitness, not for accuracy. The ability to say, believe in an afterlife in which warriors are rewarded, would seem to be more evolutionarily fit than believing that there is no afterlife or purpose to the universe at all. So it would seem that only beings with evolutionarily-fit beliefs continue to exist, and thus non-evolutionarily-fit beliefs go extinct. \n\nAt the same time, there seems to be some correlation between evolutionary fitness and “accurate description of reality” as there is a need to have accurate information in order to not be eaten, to identify sources of food, etc. \n\nCan you recommend me any thinkers that have explored this relationship? My naive thought is that evolution almost necessarily locks us out of gaining a complete picture of the universe, as we tend to lose sensory inputs that are not fit for our current environment.",

        "text": "Hi there! My question is pretty much my title. I'm trying to understand poststructuralism and I'm having a difficult time differentiating it from deconstruction. What I am understanding so far is that postmodernism seems to be a broader term denoting the historical period at the end of. the twentieth century, and that poststructuralism seems to be more methodological than ideological. However, this is the \"feel\" I'm getting, and am not confident it's the whole picture. Likewise, I have no idea where or how to differentiate poststructuralist method from the deconstructionist one. Both involve questioning the origins and validity of governing superstructures. Is it that poststructuralism moves beyond the idea of structures to begin with, whereas deconstruction is involved in investigating the \"constructedness\" of these foundational ideas to begin with (without necessarily moving beyond or outside of them)?\n\nAny help or further reading recommendations are much appreciated (essay and chapter length especially)! I've read Calinescu's *Five Faces of Modernity* and my understanding of postmodernism is based in this text (seeing it as an extension of modernism and a kind of \"twin\" of the avant-garde).",

        "text": "In Wittgenstein’s Tractatus premise 5.151 tells us how to attribute Truth-Grounds of propositions r and s that are common to both such that s follows from r and we can find the probability r gives s from the ratio Trs : Tr. \nHe makes an example of this by letting the terms ‘Tr’ and ‘Trs’ correspond to the ‘T’s’ from the truth combinations in the Schema set out in 5.101. \nThe T’s are found in the bracketed versions of truth tables of each truth-combination \n[e.g: (TFTT)] of statements (p,q). \n\nThe wording is quite ambiguous to my reading however and I am hard pressed to pick between the following interpretations.\n\nWording:\n“let Tr be the number of 'T's' in the proposition r, and let Trs be the number of 'T's' in the proposition s that stand in columns in which the proposition r has 'T's'.”\n\nSchema Excerpt:   \n(TTTT) (p,q) Tautology. (p ⊃ p. q ⊃ q)   \n(FTTT) (p,q) Not Both p and q. (~(p.q))   \n(TFTT) (p.q) If p then q. (q ⊃ p)    \n …    \n\n(There are 16 lines from all pos. combinations of p and q being T and F)   \n\n\nINTERPRETATION 1: \nLet proposition r be the complex general proposition (p,q),\nsuch then Tr is all the T’s present in all 16 combinations; Tr = 32 \n\nLet proposition s be the specific proposition of ones choosing; perhaps (~(p.q)), such then Trs is the total T’s present in its correlating truth-possibilities (FTTT); Trs = 3 \n\nThen Trs : Tr = 3 : 32. \n\n- I am in less favour of this interpretation for it gives weight to proposition r being all possible outcomes as if (p,q) are undecided in their truth values. \n\n\n\nINTERPRETATION 2:\nLet proposition r be the specific proposition (~(p.q)) such then Tr = all T’s in its truth table (bracketed version : (FTTT)); Tr = 3.\n\nLet proposition s be the specific proposition \n(q ⊃ p) where Trs is all the T’s in (TFTT) that are also on (FTTT); Trs = 2. \n\nErgo, Trs : Tr = 2 : 3.\n\n - I am in more favour of this since the specific phrasing of Wittgenstein “number of 'T's' in the proposition s that stand in columns in which the proposition r has 'T's'” is more satisfied since we are looking for T’s present in s that are also in r. \n\n\n\nEither way these are both my interpretations and both could be wrong. Please do let me know what you think and how I ought to read this premise. \n\n\nI might state that the use of ‘r’ and ‘s’ is confusing where there are no corresponding propositions labelled with this in  5.101, but I know I am not versed in the rules of logic notation and it might be that these are obvious symbols to make corresponding too, since propositional symbols ‘p’ and ‘q’ are already taken. \n\nFinally, to show further my total ignorance of the premise, what might he mean that the ratio Trs : Tr is “the probability r gives s”. \nIs it the chance s can be inferred from r? What does it mean in the language sense?\n\nDo please highlight all errors and let me know what you think he means. \n\nMany thanks for your patience in my subjectivity and your taking the time to help.",

        "text": "Terminal lucidity is a commonly observed phenomenon where medical patience of various brain conditions (such as dementia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, brain damage) end up having the functionality of their mind return to them a few hours, days or sometimes weeks and months before their death. This seems to be an example where the physical state of the brain is impaired but the function of the mind is not. This is different than say, NDE's which appear borderline supernatural but can have a naturalistic explanation, the physical parts of the brain responsible for these functions are damaged and yet they are still able to function. This seems to suggest the existence of the immaterial mind as put forward by dualism. If we look at the famous rail road spike incident, there was a person who had a rail road spike lodged in their frontal lobe, this persons behavior changed and it lead to physicalism being a predominant theory of mind (even though it is not as if this finding was incompatible with dualism.) Yet here we have a separate phenomenon which it seems no physicalist theory of the mind can account for since is practically a version where the rail road spike is in the head and the behavior still returns to normal independent of the condition of the physical brain. So this has led me to ask:\n\nIs there any naturalistic account of terminal lucidity? \n\nI have done some research and it appears as though terminal lucidity does not receive much research at all. Is this because this phenomenon seems to lead to dualism and thus frightens people of a more naturalistic persuasion? Whenever I ask  naturalists if there is an explanation, they say \"we don't know, but with more research, we will have a naturalistic explanation someday.\" Only for the research to never get done anyway. This \"we don't know\" approach to the issue of terminal lucidity seems to be nothing more than a naturalism of the gaps. They aren't able to make sense of the current data so they appeal to data we don't have. In the same way they often accuse theists of not having answers and using the phrase \"we don't know\" they are doing the same thing. \n\nI understand I may be coming off as a bit biased here, but given that naturalism is for all intense and purposes, the dogma of the day and the orthodoxy from which we judge many beliefs, I think it's about time that this supposedly superior form of analysis give us an answer or at least deliver on the promise of more research. Or has it delivered and I am simply not aware.",

Rather, it feels like my foundations are based off of fed opinions rather than opinions that I formed myself which are justifiable. For example, I need to practice to remove the \"they are wrong I'm right\" mentality. A major thing I want to learn is to really understand what the argument is, but then I don't know where to start criticizing the opinion to look for flaws as my current mentality is \"consume opinion\" + cognitive dissonance.

        "text": "I recently read Justine by the Marquis de Sade, and posted my thoughts of it, which is that it was a completely nihilistic/atheist book that can be used to break out of limited social convections and morals. I thought that de Sade was trying to create a moral philosophy out of vice, as opposed to virtue, and creating a bunch beliefs that will push the social moral boundaries, as well of the boundaries of logic, and philosophy in general. But i still thought de Sade genuinely believed his evil libertine beliefs, or at least to some extent. i did not really get the impression that he was trying to make a virtuous ethical statement, and the villains were just satire/not alligned with his beliefs.\n\ni recently been discussing this book with redditors and most people say that im wrong in thinking his immoral philosophies were to be taken seriously, one person who says i completely didn’t understand what i read. People tell me that his philosophy is more “optimistic” than i thought they were, and i shouldnt take what they villains say at face value. these are two examples of redditors explanations of the book that stumped me-\n\n“And most tellingly of all, his characters try to convince Justine that vice is a natural law because it emerges outside of the constraints of law and society, but a critical reader would point out that likewise virtue emerges naturally outside of law and society, because it preceeds them. In the end, rather than Justine being a call to a vicious life, it shows readers that they have a very real choice to make, and it's up to them to make it, no matter how comfortable or uncomfortable their choice ends up being.” \n\n“ Something in Justine that I like is her conviction in her faith and virtue. It doesn’t feel like he’s rubbing anyone’s face in her misery, the girl is actually very endearing to read about. Through all of the terror she’s experienced she still stays steadfast on finding the good in people. So as much as de Sade can write the justifications of cruelty and vice through his villains he does a very good job at justifying virtue and goodness through his heroes.”\n\nNow i dont know what to think about the book, could someone explain what de Sade was trying to do with the novel, and how his philosophy fits in with it?

        "text": "I've read most of the Prolegomena and I've finished the Transcendental Aesthetic. I think I'm a little confused on how Kant is using the word \"transcendental\", even though it should probably be beaten into my head by now. This is my understanding so far: in the Prolegomena, Kant goes on for a couple pages about the fact that he's a \"Transcendental Idealist\" and not an \"Idealist\", in that he believes things-in-themselves do exist independent of perception, however we simply cannot say anything about them. In the Transcendental Aesthetic, he claims that space and time are pure forms of the intuition, but do not exist as determinations of or relations among things in themselves. I though this meant that Kant believed space and time were ideal, however from Pluhar's Translation A28/B44:\n\n\"space is real (i.e., objectively valid) in regard to everything that we can encounter externally as object, but teaches at the same time that space is ideal in regard to things when reason considers them in themselves, i.e., without taking into account the character of our sensibility. Hence we assert that space is empirically real (as regards all possible outer experience), despite asserting that space is transcendentally ideal, i.e., that it is nothing as soon as we omit \\[that space is\\] the condition of the possibility of all experience and suppose space to be something underlying things in themselves.\"\n\nSo, he says that space and time are transcendentally ideal, but only ideal in reference to things-in-themselves apart from our perception? And later on in the beginning of the Transcendental Logic, A56/B80, he says:\n\n\"The distinction between the transcendental and the empirical belongs, therefore, only to the critique of cognitions, and does not concern the reference of these cognitions to their object.\"\n\nIs Kant using the word transcendental differently throughout his texts, and are there any serious errors in how I'm interpreting this?",
