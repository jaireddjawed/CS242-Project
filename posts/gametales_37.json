        "text": "^(First Time Poster, still experimenting with formatting stuff.)  \nSo I DM this Pathfinder game with two players. None of us had ever played a Stealth campaign, and thus the party was born:\n\n- **Samari**, a rogue halfling, fervent of Desna. Her player is very anti-optimisation: as such, Samari is a melting-pot of interesting and in-character abilities, but is largely unable to hold her own in combat. As the GM, I knew that player (she's kind of my girlfriend), and I knew that it was up to me to gear her up so she'd be up to par. Samari is light-hearted and creative, and tends to roll skill checks in combat rather than attack rolls.  \n- **Shalaya**, a human inquisitor with the personnality to match. She's the most likely to be seen shaking her head disapprovingly, very Desna-fervent, and yet is prompt at declaring that this monster there needs to die right now. Shalaya is built to be as sneaky as an inquisitor can, and prefers bows (which implies that the rogue can never actually flank).  \n- As the DM, I'm fairly lenient on the rules. As long as it doesn't break anything, it's fine. Sure, take a Weapon Proficiency as a trait, why not? I believe it makes games more interesting and unique.\n\nSo the party accepts a quest from a Noble Shaïtan (earth genie) to infiltrate a remote mansion, where the Shaitan's proeminent political opponent (an Ifreet) seems to be massing forces, probably in hopes of a land-grab in the material plane. They need to fool those plans, but the Shaïtan's name must not be associated with it, politics and all.  \n\nSo they show up to the mansion and start exploring it, slaughtering everything evil in it. It seems to be teeming with undeads and traps, which are dealt with by Shalaya and Samari respectively. They killed the five ghouls that were guarding the back door, by triggering and then dodging a giant scythe trap and letting it rip through the undeads. They then hid the ghoulish remains in the kitchen's cupboard, and the kitchen smelled of decaying flesh for the rest of the campaign.  \n\nThey end up out-sneaking a dark-folk assassin and stealing his poisons, witnessing the transformation of a Sphynx into a vampire, and killing the ifreet-serving vampire that ruled the place. The vampire was supposed to be cowardly and turn into Gaseous Form at 50% HP, and was inching towards a TPK because at 60%hp he was dominating Samari, yet Shalaya scored a critical-hit-max-damage with her Frost Longbow Bane Of Undead with her judgement active (ah, inquisitors) and basically one-shotted him.  \n\nThe evil vampire is no more! The ifreet's evil plans must be foiled, right? Not a chance. After a night in town where Desna's followers healed them, they go back to free the mansion of the influence of undeath with a priest capable of casting Atonement. They also hope to sever the place's connection to the elemental planes, hindering the creation of portals. (In this world, a portal can be opened everywhere a mortal has been killed by the elements. The party had uncovered evidence that someone had died in this mansion in a fireplace accident, and also found the remains of some poor soul who was buried alive.)  \n\nShalaya and Samari stalk around the manor, hoping to kill the last mobs, while the priest and his 5 low-level underlings perform the Atonement in the great hall. Suddenly, a great crash is heard from the front, and they rush through the rooms to check it out. Two Nessian hell hounds have just crashed the front gate, and are headed for the manor, but are held back by a gorgon and two bulettes.  \n\nCorrectly guessing that the earth-bound monsters are there to help the Shaïtan's plan, the party begins to help the slaughter of the hell hounds. The latter have more coordination and focus, though, so each turn they kill an opposing monster, rather than dishing even damage to everybody. The fight gets though, but the Frost longbow and the flanking-partners helping, the party escapes unscathed. Then the first fire elemental shows up.  \n\nThe friendly mobs had been killed already, so it was a fairly balanced two-on-one fight, but that only lasted one round. Another fire elemental shows up, then two Huge fire elementals show up. Earth elementals also sprout out of nowhere and start bashing the fire elementals. This is going south fast, and as the party finishes its first elemental, twelve more have shown up, including fire elementalists casting Geyser on the earth elementals to great effect.  \n\nWhile the inquisitor's efforts are effective at keeping the fire elementals at some distance, two earth elemental slip towards the Mansion. Samari follows, because she noticed that her 1d3 damage daggers aren't effective against elementals with DR5/-. The earth elemental, as translated by a low-level-priest-underling that fortunately spoke Terran, demand that the ritual ceases, because their mission is to open a portal to the Earth Plane. Samari avoids a diplomatic incident by convincing the Priest (and the nearby city's cult of Desna, reached via Message) to finish the spell without altering the Earth Plane link, and the elementals to pay for the second atonement in case it is diplomatically resolved at a later date to close the link.  \n\nMeanwhile, the fight is raging in front of the mansion. Shalaya is firing round after round of frost arrows, but still hardly manages to take the fire elementalists down. A few fire elementals have managed to enter the mansion's gate, but have been cut off by the earth elementals (which also meant that the brunt of earth elementals were pinchered between two squadrons of fire elementals). One Huge Fire Elemental reached the mansion and started igniting everything, because if the humans inside died, the Atonement was off, and more people had died by fire, making his link to the Fire plane stronger.  \n\nShalaya the Frost Inquisitor alternated between shooting the elemental and the walls, to put out fires. Samari however, was trapped inside and could do nothing. That's when the best ideas happen.  \n\nShe decided to just tumble through the fire elemental, trying to bluff him into thinking she had something of value and should be followed. She obviously caught on fire and dropped to the ground in the middle of a dozen enemy elementals, and completely failed her bluff check. The situation was so crazy that the huge one lost interest in the house and turned towards the little halfling... who was saved in extremis by 3 frost arrows from her partymate.  \n\nThe little halfling, convinced that this strategy was working now, asked:  \n&gt; \"Is there a lake nearby?\"  \n/rolls geography (Yes, geography. I warned you, she's not optimized.)  \n&gt; \"You have seen a lake down south. Unfortunately, it's on the other side of the Fire Elemental army.\"  \n&gt; \"Okay! I'm gonna tumble through, and bluff them to follow me.\"  \n&gt; \"You have a speed of 20ft, and the elementals move 60ft.\"  \n&gt; \"I'm sure I can manage.\"  \n\nI ruled that for every point of bluff she rolled, one elemental would be distracted and would start hunting her down instead of fighting. As Murphy would have it, she rolled a nat 20.  \n\nSo the whole fire elemental army gets sidetracked, trying to stop a running halfling from getting away. We all get flashbacks from [Pirates of the Carribean](http://images.forwallpaper.com/files/images/b/b512/b512757c/304899/pirates-of-the-caribbean-johnny-depp-jack-sparrow-running-aborigines-sea.jpg).  \n\nDo you remember the part where the city was warned about the attack, and the deal, via Message? I had planned that they would contact the nearby village of Gillmen, living in the lake. Gillmen absolutely hate fire elementals, and were close enough to the mansion to turn the tide of the battle last minute. That was counting without a halfling running fast as hell towards the lake, followed by a whole army of fire elementals, who rushed head-first in the Gillmen ambush.  \n\nThe fire elementals were defeated, the atonement succeded. The portal-to-be was soon decided to be closed, as the Shaitan didn't see value in it if it was going to turn the locals against him, and was happy enough that his enemy ifreet's plans were thwarted. Shalaya and Samari are heroes for preventing a fire-elemental invasion, and all is well that ends well.  \n\nAnd that was the best run-for-your-life moment I had ever seen.",

        "text": "Okay, so I'm playing the DnD Adventure League thing, and the new Elemental Evil campaign has just begun. This has come with a bunch of new races, among which are the goliaths. Having played a tiefling monk in the last campaign, I decided to switch things up and made a goliath war cleric. Eight foot tall, Lawful Neutral, with a massive warhammer and a typical goliath attitude of \"I am *the* biggest, baddest motherfucker, and woe betide anyone who challenges that\" mixed with worship of Tempus makes him a badass bastard and fun as all hell to play.\n\nLast week was the first session, and it was pretty standard. Arrive at this podunk town, get told about bandits, go to fight the bandits. There were two possible locations, and the first one we arrived at had five wolves in it. We were a pretty squishy party of five. Unfortunately for the wolves, I am Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus. Things didn't go too great, but I managed to take down three of the wolves. I pretty quickly figured out the technique of wearing my shield into battle to get the AC boost to protect against the fact that I inevitably roll crap on initiative, and then as soon as it's my turn, drop it and turn my warhammer into a two-hander for that sweet, sweet d10 action. It's also the first time I use the goliath racial ability, Stone's Endurance, which allows you, once per rest, short or long, to shrug off a d12+Con mod of damage.\n\nWe go to the next location, and there's five bandits and a bear in a cage. The rogue shoots one dead using sneak attack, the wizard puts two to sleep, I run up and smash another, and the last one barely has time to work out what the fuck's happening before I'm all up in his face like mid-sized, angry rockslide. Our DM rolls a wisdom save for him, he fails, and proceeds to try to run away screaming. Unfortunately for him, I am Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus. I grab him, throw him to the ground at my feet, and lecture him on the importance of courage and always searching for victory. Having provided him with a rousing speech, I tell him to get up and face me in single combat. If he wins, he can go free. He picks up his sword, looks up at me, and then takes a disengage action and is off on his heels again. I bellow in rage and throw my warhammer at him. The force of my anger at his cowardice and the blessings of Tempus propel the weapon directly into the back of his skull and crush it.\n\nSome of the party objected to this, thinking it merely murderhobo fighting for fighting's sake, but Vivek isn't a savage: if we'd taken the bandit back, the villagers would have just executed him anyway. I gave him the opportunity to face death with honour. (Besides, they'd been quite happy to slit the throats of the two sleeping bandits before they woke up.)\n\nIt's at this point that the bear breaks out of its cage and mauls our fighter.\n\nYeah. We kinda forgot about that.\n\nInitiatives are rolled, I'm somehow first, and  run towards the bear. The DM describes the bear as big, hungry, and pissed off. Unfortunately for the bear, I am Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus. Now, war clerics have a pretty gucci ability: for an amount of times per day, equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can make a bonus weapon attack whenever you take an attack action. I run up, swing, and hit. Six on the dice, nine total. Use my bonus attack, narrating it as bringing the hammer back round on the backswing and smashing it underhand into the bear's chest. It crumples. I stabilise the fighter with a medicine check, we loot all the stuff there is to be looted, and then throw the bandit corpses, bear corpse, and our unconscious fighter into the back of the cart the bandits had and move off.\n\nSide-note: partway on the journey back, the fighter wakes up after a couple hours of unconsciousness. Suddenly returning to wakefulness and finding himself next to a bear, he fails the wisdom check and jumps out of the wagon in a panic, only to fail his dex roll as well, and land on his head, bashing himself back into unconsciousness. So that's how a bear KO'd our fighter twice, the second time when it was dead. He has a new flaw, fear of bears, and we all make ursine puns at every opportunity.\n\nWe return to the town, demonstrate that we've killed the bandits, and I take the bear down to the tanners so that they can turn it into a cloak for me.\n\nThis session, I was wondering the town, and went into the butcher's for some supplies. While chatting to the butcher, who is also the town's de facto guard commander, mostly because he stands at a mere six foot ten, he mentions that the owner of the poultry shop next door has been hassling him about some kind of problem with her girl. I buy a whole dried ham, and go next door. The woman, Minthra, tells me that her granddaughter was playing out in the forest near an old tomb and saw a ghost, and her granddaughter's not the lying type. I tell her I'll investigate, for want of anything else to do, and go back to the tavern to round up the others. \n\nWe all merrily walk off according to our directions, and come to an old tomb. Our stonemasonry-obsessed dwarf spends ages asking for details about the ajar door, and then opens it, prompting a clatter from the other side: a load of old metal had been placed above the door, and opening it dislodged it. Our gnome cleric of Gorm points out that ghosts don't need home invasion alarms, and we proceed along. We come to a chamber with a large stone table and a door in one wall. There's nothing in the room, but upon approaching the door, a spectral figure appears. \"Leave my master's tomb,\" it intones, in a sombre, listless voice. We interrogate it about itself, its master, and whether it scared a young girl the other day. It answers our questions briefly, repeating its injunction to begone. Most of the party starts to file out. Unfortunately for the ghost, I am Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus. Vivek is of the opinion that anything that dies should stay dead and go to its rest: this is clearly a fallen warrior who has been bound into eternal service, and I resolve to release him to his just reward. And anyway, I don't take orders from him. The ghost, seeing the way I'm eyeing him up, unsheaths its wraith-like sword and steps towards me and the remaining fighter in the room, prompting me to yell in pleasure at the imminent fight. The fighter goes first, and fires an arrow at the ghost. The ghost takes a swing at me and would have put me down, but I use Stone's Endurance to shrug it off. My turn. I use Divine Favour to get an extra d4 of radiant damage, and then lay into him with my warhammer. The rest of the party, hearing sounds of battle, piles back into the room, and we all duke it out with the ghost, with me delivering the final blow, using my cleric's double-whammy. I make the sign of Tempus and thank my god for allowing me to help the warrior's shade to his rest.\n\nWe open the next door and enter another, smaller room with a large stone coffin and a rusted chest. One of the fighters announces that she's just going to open it without checking for traps, so I move to the door and ready an action to move like buggery if something happens. Nothing does, and inside the chest is a gold chain, a locket with an engraving of a half-elf, a mouldering book, and two rings. The rest of the party, which weren't keen on entering the tomb in the first place, are hanging back. Vivek, along with most goliaths, has a pretty practical attitude to these things: you're only entitled to what you can hold onto, and you sure as hell can't hold onto stuff when you're dead. This guy tried, and we defeated his guardian, so that's poor luck on him. Upon seeing the shinies, the rest of the party is happy enough to take their shares.\n\nOur stone-centric dwarf, though, has other ideas: he wants to crack open the coffin for further loot. Like I've said, Vivek isn't squeamish, but even he thinks rummaging through a dead guy's bones is in poor taste. We're all walking out the door when the dwarf yells, \"what's the matter? Is it too heavy for you?\" Unfortunately for me, I am Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus. I turn around, glower at the lippy little sod, and then stride over to the tomb and wrench the lid off. Inside is a skeleton with a rusted breastplate and two longswords. I ask about the condition of them, and the DM replies that the breastplate is rusted, but the swords are in excellent repair, sparkling in the torchlight as they leap into the air and take swings at me and the dwarf. Yup, enchanted swords. I batter down the one closest to me, and they drop back into the coffin. The gnome cleric, being obsessed with all things magical and mechanical, decides he has to get a look at them, and goes up to the coffin. This prompts the other sword to jump back up and resume its attacks, so we bash that one too. After that, the gnome proceeds to pick it up, despite none of us knowing if it was going to jump up again. It doesn't, and the DM awards us both inspiration, me for taking off the lid and the gnome for being suicidally curious.\n\nWe take a short rest and leave the tomb with our prizes, and me and one of the fighters are at the front of our column as we step blinking into the daylight... and a sudden flurry of javelins. One misses the fighter, the other hits me, but I use Stone's Endurance to shrug it off. Outside are two goblins and a half-ogre. The goblins point at us. \"You have been in the tomb. You have the treasure! Give us the treasure!\" Initiatives are rolled, I come out with a princely 0, a few shots are loosed at the half-ogre, and our barbarian and a fighter rush it and the goblins. Unfortunately for them, they are not Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus, and both go down. The goblins repeat their demand, and the others begin to acquiesce. Fuck that. While all this has been going on, I've been eyeing up the half-ogre. The DM says that he's roughly the same size as me. That's a challenge in itself, nevermind these two screechy goblins trying to mug us. I let out a roar and charge the half-ogre. It shifts confidently and grins.\n\nUnfortunately for the half-ogre, I am Vivek Warsinger, Battleguard of Tempus.\n\nI cover the ground at a sprint, dropping my shield, and cannon into my adversary shoulder first. His strength is no match for mine, and he goes sprawling to the ground, prone. It's at this point that I pay particular attention to the wording of the war cleric's ability: when you take an Attack action, you may make a bonus weapon attack. Shoving is an attack action. While the ogre is prone, I bring up my warhammer above my head and slam it down into his chest, shattering it. \n\nI then bellow at the goblins and tell them to drop their weapons. I tell them to turn out their pockets, and then ask them why they're so close to a settlement - apparently the travellers make for easy pickings. I then ask them if they frightened a human girl the other day. They pause in confusion, and then nod. \"That solves that,\" I rumble, and then inform them that they have the honour of facing me in single combat for their lives. The first one picks up his weapon, looks at me, and then runs like buggery, in what seems to be becoming a running theme. I chase after him, screaming about cowardice, and pulverise his skull. The next one fares no better. We get everyone patched up, I take the ogre's head, and we head back into town. I walk to the store, and throw the half-ogre's head on the ground. \"There's your granddaughter's ghost,\" I tell the slightly traumatised shopkeeper. \"It's safe for her to play now.\"",

        "text": "Hiya guys, you might remember me from the last time I posted here. It's been a few months of in-game time since my incident with the book (Lyria still doesn't trust me around paper or flammable objects). Since we last spoke, we've removed a nasty curse that had laid Tar'Hal low, met a Rakshasa who calls himself the Watcher, and built a literal medieval battle-tank. And just yesterday, we pulled off the greatest heist in the history of Restrol: We robbed the Royal Palace in Waystone, right under the nose of the King and both of his sons!\n\nDramatis Personae:\n\nYours truly, Jericho Archtan: Wizzyman extraordinaire.\n\nLyria Blackstrand: Human, female wizard/beguiler.\n\nAvi: Half-elf Bard.\n\nTar'Hal: Half-Orc (scary) Barbarian\n\nKarl Tanner: ~~The fookin legend~~ Human Cleric of Yondala\n\nOur story begins in Tedrille, home to the King's youngest son, Prince Riffen Hobthorne. Prince Riffen is a troubled lad, and his relationship with his father is about as smooth as a troll's backside. He also isn't exactly the nicest person in the world, given his propensity to drink and worship of the god of Tyranny, Hextor. \n\nWe've worked for the prince several times before, and it seemed that this would be nothing other than an ordinary summons and job, but our meeting was interrupted by the sudden arrival of the Knight of Cups, the representative of the King and Master of Ceremonies, such as it is, in the Kingdom. He had come to the city of Tedrille by way of Dawnbrook to personally invite Prince Riffen to the capital, Waystone, for a lavish feast, as King Hobthorne wanted to see his two sons again. The other Prince, Gowry, had already been invited and accepted the invitation. \n\nThis information is all relayed to us after the Knight of Cups leaves however, while Prince Riffen attempted to drown himself in wine. And in his malice at his father, he suggested a task for us: with the entire royal family at the feast, the security on the vaults in both the royal castle and the citadel of Dawnbrook would be weakened for a short while, an excellent time for a little heist.\n\nWith alacrity, we accepted and chose to rob the King himself. Visions of coins danced in our mind, and with a warning to travel separately from the Prince to minimize suspicion, we laid plans and set out. A short boat ride brought us to the capital, and we met the Prince's contact: Lafa. \n\nLafa is, to put it bluntly, not a laughing man. He is the only person Tar'Hal is frightened by, and not without reason. He's a cold-blooded and vicious murderer, and he'd probably consider that a compliment! Regardless, he was here to help us get into and out of the castle, and to fence whatever we took. He knew which window would be left open, and let us know he would distract the guards. \n\nOur motley crew and plans thus assembled, we prepared for the night of the feast, the night of Kingsday. When it arrived, we scaled the wall of the keep (by which I mean that Tar'Hal picked us up and lifted us into the 12 foot high window, as he is 8 feet tall) and entered through the unlocked window into a nicely appointed guest bedroom, where we ready ourselves for our raid. The bard casts Glibness, and Lyria and I prepare stealthy spells and scrolls in case of trouble. Not wishing to attract attention, we sent Avi into the hallway first, to distract any guards. One guard approaching, she plays it smooth, trying to get him into the room, where Tar'Hal is waiting with a heavy fist. But he plays it off, and promising not to say anything and to 'visit later', resumes his patrol in the opposite direction. We breathe a sigh of relief and bundle out of the room, looking for other patrols. \n\nAnd, of course, there was another patrol. Two guards this time. Some quick wordplay, a distraction, a glance in the other direction, and then knives into their chests. Bodies under the bed, let's roll. We make our way through the suspiciously quiet castle, hearing the revelry from the distant feast, the clanking of heavy boots on the floor above us. We pass by magnificently appointed rooms, lavish guest bedrooms, expansive and expensive tapestries, but our true goal is yet ahead--the Vault.\n\nWe reach it, and standing guard aren't just the typical castle guards. These two are Royal Guardsmen, with swords and richly appointed armor that indicated they would certainly not be an easy fight. As we approach, they draw swords, cross them over the vault's door, and ask our business. Avi attempts to explain that she is there to retrieve an item for the feast, a gift for the King from one of his sons, and the guards buy it. Then Karl speaks up, and rolls out the most ridiculous mean of explaining why we need keys to all the locked chests in the vault. They don't buy it, and it touch some more quick explaining to justify why we brought the half-wit along--in this case, because he was the only one who had seen the item we needed. With some heavy suspicion, the guards let us pass into the Vault.\n\nAnd, by all the gods, it was quite a Vault. Gold, piled everywhere. Weapons, encrusted with gems. Magical artifacts, both in the open and sealed in cages. A golden harp, with a magical sheen. And in a nicely appointed cage, a wooden box. Our bard finagled with the lock, using a magical key that has a 10% chance to open any lock. The locked opened, and we grabbed the ring from inside. Due to the guards, we would be unable to grab everything, but this is where the problems began.\n\nSee, we had to leave Tar'Hal outside the vault. He's pretty distinctive, and you just don't let Orcs into a vault anyways in my opinion. While he loiters outside the Vault entrance, out of sight of the royal guards, another patrolling guard happens by him. He questions him, and finding his reason for being there unsatisfactory, turns to get the Captain of the Guards and an explanation for the Orc's presence. Tar'Hal can't allow this of course.\n\nNow, we didn't hear anything other than a crash of metal hitting the floor, but since we did, those two Royal Guards did too. One of them begins walking up the stairs, pike extended, to check out the disturbance. At this point, it looks like the jig is up.\n\nBut they weren't counting on magic. A quick deep slumber brought one of them crashing down to the earth, while the other found himself enveloped in a Hold Person. With the guards subdued, we quickly moved to ensure their silence. Karl massacred the sleeping one, and I moved to bash in the paralyzed guard's face with my staff. I barely broke his nose, but I suppose it's still possible to bleed out that way. Their deaths were quick. We grabbed Tar'Hal, the other guard's corpse, and dumped them in the vault.\n\nThen, with no witnesses, we looted it. Thoroughly. All the gold, all the items. And we went off on our way, pausing periodically to loot guest bedrooms as we went. From one wall we took a tapestry, from one room we got a nice rug for our battle tank. From another, a painting of comets. After our pillaging, we were back at the room we entered in, and quickly out the window and onto the ground. Avi was the last one to go, when she heard a knock at the door. \n\nThe guard she tried to seduce earlier was back, and under the impression that the deal was still on. Of course, she wasn't going to delay her escape for a guard. From what she told us, she tied him to the bed we had stuffed the dead guards under and, promising him her eternal love, which he believed completely (She rolled a natural 20 and with +30 from a Glibness spell and +7 bluff modifier, a total of 57 on her bluff check for that lie) and escaped out the window.\n\nWith our getaway secure, we pawned off most of the jewels, kept the magic items and the rug, and headed off on our way. The next day, we were on our way home with the Prince, who got to go home early thanks to the theft and the possibility of an attempted assassination. We also found out that the ring we took, which Lyria put on, was cursed, but that's a story for another time. Sucks to be her.\n\nAll in all, total profits: excessive. Listening to the drunk Prince rant: hilarious. Watching the bard seduce and tie up a guard: Priceless. \n\nAnd that's how we robbed the King on Kingsday and went home by Jumday. \n\n",

Really booksmart, hardly any common sense though. Seems as if his dumpstats were both charisma and wisdom. Charisma, for his lack of compromise and tact; wisdom, for, well, you'll find out.\n\nNow, onto J and his belt of athleticism. He spec'd his character Vincent, into the Whirling Dervish prestige class. We had just left from a fight, and grabbed one of the Elemental Artifacts of legend, the Earth Elemental Rod of Power. However, after we grabbed it, the whole underground ruins started to crumble and crack. This is where the Belt of A-threat-icism came into play.\n\nNow, we managed to find an escape route, but the entire underground ruins were now collapsing into the magma pit below. We had to make either balance, jump, or tumble checks to traverse the destabilizing gangways that criss-crossed over the magma pit. No biggie, we're high enough levels that all we had to not do was not get a 1. After the DM was describing all the sights and sounds of the collapsing ruins, J told the DM that he was gonna take 10 on tumble checks and just somersault and flip around like a goddamn ninja.\n\nThe DM told him that this was an extenuating circumstance, and that he couldn't Take 10, even with the belt of athleticism. J got into a bit of a hissy fit and started to argue with the DM.\n\n\"Look J, all you need to do is roll and not get a 1. That's all I'm asking. Even if you get a 1, with your high enough Dexterity, you can get a reflex save, even if you get a 1\"\n\nSo we're all looking at J, to see what he does. \"FINE, I'll roll the goddamn d-twen-...MOTHERFUCK\"\n\nHe rolled a 1, while somersaulting and backflipping around over collapsing gangways above a magma pit.\n\n\"Jayyyyy, do you wanna roll a reflex\", said the concerned DM.\n\n\"FUCK YOU, MIKE! I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO ROLL IT IN THE FIRST PLACE\"\n\n\"You still get a reflex saveeeeeee\"\n\n\"No, Mike! I'm not gonna roll a reflex save.\"\n\n\"So you're gonna fall 110' into the magma pit\"\n\nAll J did was give Mike the middle finger.\n\nThe [final act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NPisqhg7iI) of Vincent",

        "text": "I have a homebrew campaign setting, that is pretty loosely built so it's up to the players to decide what they want to do and thus where the story goes. My philosophy is that I just throw situations at them and they get to decide how to handle it.\n\nAlso, I should mention that we play with critical successes and failures. If you roll a 20 or a 1, you throw again. Should you get a 20 or 1 again, something awesome or awful happens and you repeat the roll again. For example, I had an NPC throw a fort save against nausea, rolling a 1, then a 20. So one of the PC's recoiled in disgust as said NPC projectile vomited as he had never seen anyone do before. Or, in a previous campaign, the gorilla-animal-companion of one of the players had two 1's followed by a 2 on an attack roll. He would have contracted a disease because he missed his target and hitting the blood-soaked ground (gladiator arena - long story), getting an infection.\n\nAnyway, the group was in a dwarven city on a diplomatic mission to bring their armies to support a rebel uprising against the monarchy in exchange for the promise that the leader of said rebel army would hand over a powerful artifact that was said to have been given to the dwarves by Torag, their god, himself long ago and that had been lost and had now been found again.\n\nThe dwarves jumped at the opportunity and said that they would help mobilise their brethren in other dwarven cities, all they needed was time. They could spare few of their own men, however, because their first line of defense against the horrors of the deep and the duergar had fallen and they needed to get it back. There was a huge wall (many stories high and dozens of metres thick - more fortress than wall) and someone would have to close it's gate before the district behind it could be taken back.\n\nAll the group had to do was to get behind enemy lines, get into the wall/fortress, flip a switch and apply alchemical glue to it, so it couldn't be opened by the duergar before they were defeated.\n\nTwo of the group, a fetchling rogue and a dwarven monk, sneaked past the enemy lines, getting roughed up pretty badly in the process and having more encounters than they ever had, most of which they ran away from, and finally reached complex. There, they sneaked through the building and heard an explosion, from which duergar were fleeing. Smoke crept through the hallways and they decided to check out what had happened. They found siege weaponry, including some cannon-ball shaped contraptions that were obviously bombs. The walls were covered in the remains of the poor sod who had set off one of them. Doing what every sensible adventurer would do, they packed two of them each, without knowing how sensitive they were and doused one of them in strong alcohol.\n\nFinally, they reached the corridor at the end of which was the stairwell that included the only way to the switch, even without alerting the duergar to their presence. Sadly for them, they would have to pass an open door of a room where the leaders of the enemies were sitting. So they decided to go up one level instead and actually found a secret access to the room. On their way, though, they did raise the alarm unintentionally by attacking a duergar that was obviously more heavily armed and armored than all of those they encountered earlier. So when they opened the passage, a duergar stood with the back to them, again one of the lieutenants who was tougher than the average enemy. Not having learned from their earlier mistake, they attacked, despite having smokebombs and literally only having to flip the switch and spending two actions to apply the alchemical glue and an accelerant. They did defeat the duergar and flipped the switch, but now several more came running up the stairs. So what do they do? Throw the alcohol-drenched rucksack with two cannonballs in it of course! Followed by an alchemist fire!\n\nThe rogue threw the backpack, the dwarf the alchemist fire. He only had to hit against AC 5, since he targeted the ground. A 2 would have sufficed. Instead, he rolled a 1. To confirm, he rolled a 1 again. Then a third one. Then, finally, a 7.\n\nSince they were handling bombs they knew nothing about and seeing at how spectacularly they had failed, the resulting explosion not only vaporised their enemies, but the stairwell *and* the mechanism for the gate. They made their reflex saves against the fireball that was produced (or at least survived it), but the gate would not be closed.\n\nThey did manage to get back to their allies again, but the dwarven kingdom lost their first line of defense and now would have real trouble getting that district back again.\n\nAnd that is how my group accidentaly screwed over their allies.",

        "text": "This story comes from a campaign run by the sorcerer from my D&amp;D group in which I am playing some slightly unhinged computer nerd. The system and play style is, thus, different, but shenanigans still abound. In case anyone's wondering, we do run on the Deadlands Classic system despite using the Hell on Earth setting.\n\nSo on our second session we're interrogating some asshole about something, and he keeps taunting us to shoot him in the stomach. Our medical expert (a petite girl with a fucking SAW light machine gun) pokes around his abdomen, making a Medicine roll, and determines that there's some kind of device in his stomach. So she decides to roll surgery (while he's perfectly conscious, mind you) to cut him open and remove the device.\n\nShe pulls a detonator out of him with the words \"Bye bye\" written on it, guy starts laughing as we all roll Nimbleness. We get fairly average rolls, then The Marshal rolls for the NPC in the room. Now, in case you don't know, Deadlands uses Exploding Dice; you roll a certain number of a specific die type and take the highest of those, but if you roll the highest value on the die you're rolling, you roll again and add the value to your roll. The NPC was rolling 3D10 on this check. He got a 54.\n\nMarshal is pretty stunned. We're all laughing our asses off. After some consideration, The Marshal decides to roll a D4 to determine which of a few ridiculously nimble things this NPC does; he ends up nonchalantly pulling out his pistol and, without looking, firing five shots into the guy which neatly sever the circuits of the bomb inside him, disarming it. He then holsters the weapon and goes about his business, having fewer fucks to give than Latvians have potatoes to eat. And so that NPC became the most nimble man in all of post-apocalyptic Boston, and it was beautiful.",

        "text": "Been holding this story in reserve for a little while, as part of it would have given away the betrayal I'd been plotting. Now that cat's out of the bag, so here's the tale of how my party of cocky shitbags took a Beholder boss fight and turned it into fucking nothing.\n\nSo, the party's wandering through the depths when they stumble upon a massive cavern. Druid's nature bullshit powers allow him to sense some vague corruption within, but they can't see anything. Cleric casts some sort of Detect Evil thing (causing the secretly evil party members to panic for a bit, but cleric was looking for some nasty and not paying attention to his comrades), and they edge into the cave all cautiously. Where they enter is about thirty or so feet from the cavern's floor, with a spiraling path in the middle of the room leading down to the surface. Once they reach that, the cleric detects something: an aberration, coming right for them.\n\nA few seconds later, a Beholder flies up above the edge of the cliff and starts being ugly at them. Everyone rolls initiative, cleric goes first. He goes to smite it, but I inform him that it's flying out of range. So he looks into the spell book, and then I tell him that the Beholder projects an antimagic field from its main eye, cancelling out any magic in a 150 ft cone in the direction it's looking. Everyone in the party is either spellcaster or melee fighter.\n\nEntire table shits pants. I am smug.\n\nCleric decides to run down the spiraling path out of its line of sight. Werewolf fighter and one of the paladins do the same. The second paladin (these two were the secretly evil guys, identical twins, essentially the same character) tries to intimidate the Beholder. He fails. Then it's the Beholder's turn, it uses one of its swanky Lair powers to seize the three who fled with spooky wavy arms from out of the walls. Our sorcerer then exploits the fact that his branch of the sorcerer class gets a pair of dragon wings because fuck you by flying out behind the Beholder to get out of the antimagic field. It turns around to look at him as a reaction, foiling his plan, and he ends his turn hovering. Then it's the druid's turn.\n\nThis fucking guy. He notes that the Beholder is turned away from him, enabling him to cast a spell. He's right, but I figure he's going to get his shit ruined on the Beholder's next turn. He casts Feeblemind. I blink. This spell, if the target fails their saving throw, reduces the target's Intelligence to 1, rendering them unable to cast or sustain any magical effects. I check the spell description. I check the Beholder's stats. Nothing saying he can't do it. He rolls, DC for Beholder's saving throw is set fucking absurdly high because the Druid has used the Wabbajack to buff his Intelligence into the stratosphere. I roll. The Beholder fails.\n\nFuck.\n\nBeholder's antimagic field stays up, but he can no longer use any of his spells or powers. His only other attack is bite, which does shit damage and forces him to close to melee. In one fell stroke, all of the advantages this thing had were fucked. The melee characters go to town and obliterate the Beholder before the next round is up. I was, admittedly, irked. It could even be said that my jimmies were rustled. \n\nI played up my anger to a much greater degree than was necessary though, in order to distract the rest of the players while my secretly evil paladins confronted a problem: one of the captives in the Beholder's lair was a cleric who had known the two of them before they'd gone bad, and if he woke up he would be able to identify them as having fallen. So I raged and screamed for about ten minutes until the two of them decided to try to \"heal\" this poor soul with \"Lay on Hands,\" while actually casting Vampiric Touch and killing him. All went according to plan, and the party moved on. I gave them no experience for the Beholder.\n\nTL;DR- A Feeblemind a day keeps the Beholder away.",

        "text": "I DM, in this case something that resembles DnD 3.5 at first glance.\n\nAt the start of my campaign, a player asked if he could play a tank. Not a super-tough paladin who was slow and plated, but an honest-to-goodness treads and guns tank. \n\nI said no.\n\n He later asked (In a tone of voice that should have aroused my suspicion) if he could play as a warforged. I saw no reason why not, and he decided on a warforged juggernaut paladin type. \n\nNamed Panzer. \n\nThis should have tipped me off. His story was that he was a warforged who's greatest ambition was to become his OWN god, of invincibility and protection. We played a few sessions, and then he asked about multiclassing as an artificer. (I must stop a moment to say that I homebrewed that warforged can be upgraded/modified by artificers, who can also create prosthetics, out of warforged parts.) I allowed this on the basis that it'd be interesting to see what he did.\n\nThree levels, one nat 20, and an interesting encounter with a pirate later, he had a cannon for a head. \n\nA while after that, he opted to have a plus 2 to strength and AC if he could have a combustion engine added in, at the penalty of needing coal every 3 hours, as well as a -2 in speed.\n\nQuite a bit of time later he had his lower arms replaced by flamethrowers hooked up to his engine, negating his ability to grasp, but giving him a fucking awesome encounter power.\n\n\nBy this point he had three tiny-size minions: a Gnome artificer whom he kidnapped, an ominously intelligent metal hedgehog, and a brain in a jar, who gave criticizing advice and was permanently drunk, ever since someone spilled a some grog of substantial whimsy in his brain juice. Panzer innocently asked if he could have an interior cavity to keep his 'friends' safe, and I assented.\n\nIt was when he added in the tank treads that I realized what he was doing, but it was too late. His transformation was complete.\nOperated and repaired by a tiny gnome, a hedgehog gunner (complete with tiny cigar) to fire the cannon, and a brain in a jar to fire spells, give bad advice in a fake German accent, and serve as lookout/commentator. It may seem obvious said like this, but since it took place over months, it was anything but.\n\nI am proud to say he is now the BBEG of the new campaign, and honestly, he's good at it.",

        "text": "[Once more, I welcome you humble folks to my stupid, inane storytime!](http://redd.it/2yhmob) [Get acquainted with our humble party, Barrel the halfling rogue, Pratena the cyclops murderchild, Thoth the shabti magus, and Rose the dullahan ranger.](http://imgur.com/a/4xfYd) Done that? Good! Here's what they're up to.\n\nWord comes down the grapevine through Partyboss that there's been some generic bandit activity, and could we all go murderify it, kay thanks. It's just about as generic of a quest as you can possibly get. But why bother about how droll and samey it is when we can try out some new equipment? Plus, there might be loot! The party packed all their stuff into their mechanical-horse-drawn-cart and set off for Generic Bandit HQ Incorporated.\n\nAlong the way, they ran into the town where most of the bandits had actually fled from. Partyboss (who was coming along for funsies) pointed out that the dumbass villagers had lived perfectly peaceful lives up until some 13-headed hydra thing had charged in, grabbed the only person with a brain, and left. For some reason, everyone else decided to leave all their earthly possessions behind and become bandits instead. In short, these guys were either callous and lazy enough to jump at the chance to make life shittier for everyone, or they were so thick that you could bounce bricks off their heads without fear of them losing brain cells.\n\nSpeaking of which, when the party spotted the dilapidated old keep (because there's always a dilapidated old keep, if skyrim has taught me anything), Rose decided that the existing entries would simply not do, and she would be creating her own in the manner of massive, cheerful red abominations everywhere: by charging through the wall. But something mister Koolaid-man doesn't make very public is the three consecutive run-ups he had to do before the brickwork gave way. Thoth was highly amused, but decided to try just walking in through the front door, which was unguarded.\n\nWhile a few folks around what was recently a wall were getting acquainted with Rose, Barrel and Pratena were trying to be sneaky and get around a side-entrance. They ended up meeting Thoth dead-center in the keep, and decided that the one surefire way to get into the heavily-fortified door into the Bandit Captain's Personal Quarters^TM was by knocking and politely asking to be let inside. One bluff check later, Thoth, Pratena and Barrel were standing in front of the nefarious Cap'n Bandit, who was VERY interested in *just why the guards had let a bunch of heavily-armed adventurers into his goddamned office.* Thoth explained that he was challenging Cap'n to a duel for control of the bandit forces.\n\nLong story short, Cap'n hit Thoth over the head with his desk, and then quickly became a fine black outline on the opposite wall. The captain is dead! Long live the new captain! The only excitement after that was pulling Rose out of a eight-on-one brawl that she had been winning. After that, they followed through on the whole \"bandit captain\" business, cleared it with partyboss, and hired the entire bandit fort on as reserve troops. They were dubbed the \"crimson vestments\", and they were all promised ham sandwiches if they did good.\n\nAdventure completed, they headed home and- *OH SNAP AMBUSH*\n\nYes, on their way back through the abandoned village, everyone was taken by complete surprise when the ground beneath the party's cart exploded. The Crimson Vestments watched in confusion as everyone was dumped into a basement that had apparently been built under the goddamned road, of all the stupid- ANYWAY there were a bunch of ratfolk down there and they shouted something about a bounty on Barrel's head. Go time!\n\nNow, this battle was quite interesting- these ratfolk knew their stuff. They were all level 5 (the party was at level 10), but they had kitted themselves superbly. Up front was a closing wall of armored ratfolk dual-wielding tower shields (all mirrored), and all of them got the benefit of a lot of teamwork buffs. Not to put too fine a point on it, these sheild-bearers were harder to hit than Cthulhu and the Tarrasque. They had an armor class of \"Don't even try\", and enough health to make you regret it if you did. Their only real fault was that their attacks were a measly +1, meaning they might be able to hit the broad side of a barn, if the wind was right. Their offense was provided by six rogues, who gleefully abused the mechanics of Spring Attack (move before and after attacking) and the ratfolk racial trait of swarming (can occupy the same space as another ratfolk, if they both attack the same target it counts as flanking) to make EVERY attack a sneak attack and never suffer any consequences for it. The shield-bearers would box the party in, and the rogues would dart in and out, shanking everyone to death.\n\nThat was the plan, anyway, but the Rat Phalanx had not counted on Barrel vaulting over the shields and completely decimating the rogues while Pratena bull rushed holes in their defensive line. Once all the rogues were down, the shieldbearers were completely screwed. Plus, all that armor didn't do jack about Thoth's Storm Step ability. The party emerged victorious, but bleeding from quite a few nasty wounds. Barrel, who had taken the worst of it, demanded that...\n\nThat they pack their shit and get on the cart, because Partyboss could use a troupe of fighters this well-organized.\n\n&gt; DM: You're not supposed to RECRUIT every random encounter onto your side! AaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAA-\n\nAfter that, there was a brief confrontation with the entity that had hired the rat phalanx- some sort of invisible creature that apparently hated Barrel hard enough to light the party's cart on fire just to spite them. Explanations were demanded, but not forthcoming, and the creature left after hucking one more goodbye bottle of alchemist's fire at Barrel's face. Dismay followed, as the cart had held quite a few things, like rations, spare equipment, and Pratena's pet corpse, Buster. Rest in peace (again), buddy.\n\nBut, because they were goddamned ADVENTURERS, they made the best of the situation. Rose crit succeeded a craft check, and mounted an *ENTIRE HOUSE* on four wheels, and hitched it up to the (thankfully unharmed) robot horses. With the help of the Crimson Vestments and the Rat Phalanx, obviously. All in all, they had come out very firmly on top, despite everything. The only trouble was how they were going to house and feed their own little army, and THAT problem was palmed off onto Partyboss. Oh, the joys of being in command...\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"What it takes to be a leader (probably a big stick)\", JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS AND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TATTOO?](http://redd.it/314rwc)",

        "text": "WARNING: This story contains spoilers for the Adventure Path \"The Dragon's Demand\". Do not read further, if you do not want to spoil yourself. You have been warned.\n\nThis is the story of Titurel, Ramourn, Ninfalas and Niccolo as they attempt to negotiate with kobolds and, after failing in their endeavour, proceed to scare the wits out of these little fools.\n\nBut first, let me introduce you to my party (all of us are level 2):\n\n* Titurel is our human, two-dagger using knifemaster (rogue archetype). *If* he manages to flank, he does quite a bit of damage.\n* Ramourn is a human fighter who uses sword and shield. Nevertheless, when he hits, enemies rarely get up (he has a tendency to roll crits on low-HP critters).\n* Ninfalas is a half-elf staffmagus (magus archetype). He and Niccolo are spellbook-buddies helping each other out with spell research.\n* Niccolo - played by me - is a human illusionist with a tremendous bonus to Bluff and Diplomacy. He is basically a wizard with a dash of bard.\n\nOur quest was more or less your standard adventure task: Kobolds have settled too close to town. Get them away by any means necessary. Great reward.\n\nAh, I see that murderous glint in your eyes: a perfect quest - you get to be murder-hobos with a clear conscience and a full purse to boot! But that is not how it went, oh no, quite the opposite. In fact, half our group (namely Niccolo and Ninfalas) were quite the pacifists and determined to solve this peacefully (after all: no fight means no risk of injury or death, right?).\n\nPreviously, we had learned that the tribe's chieftain had recently begun worshipping some kind of new \"master\". No one had ever seen this master, some were sure he had just lost it, but still they followed his orders. One kobold named Nighttail, however, dared to speak up against the chief and was a constant thorn in his eyes.\n\nTherefore, our plan was set: Get to the kobolds, find Nighttail, convince her that resettling the tribe was best for all of us (mostly them, because otherwise: slaughter! But hey ...) and make her the new chief.\n\nAnd this is where our story begins.\n\nWe begin to scout the location of the kobold lair and our rogue is promptly detected. We rush to his side and Niccolo begs the kobolds to stay their attack and listen. One good diplomacy roll later and he explains that we come in peace and would like to speak to the chieftain. The kobolds are confused, so we promise to come back in the evening.\n\nAs we do so, we are greeted by spears and sling shots followed by cries of \"death to the humansss!\". As negotiations seem to be off the table (at least temporarily), we retreat and regroup. We form a new plan: if diplomacy does not work, maybe intimidation will!\n\nAfter resting and preparing the necessary spells, we approach the cave again at midday. Together we charge down a slope and Niccolo first casts *Obscuring Mist*, and then, under the cover of his magical veil, he engineers a scene no kobold would soon forget.\n\nNow let us picture the scene unfolding in front of the kobold's incredulous eyes: the strange group of humans charges towards them, and is then all of the sudden swallowed up by mist. From beyond the mist, the cries of a dozen fearsome warriors reaches their ears (*Ghost Sound*). A few seconds later, thirteen warriors (*Silent Image*) about 4m tall (*Enlarge Person*) charge towards them; two of them proceed to slice a kobold each into pieces. The kobolds fail their will save to disbelieve the illusion. Ramourn intimidates them with a roll of 24 (remember: +8 due to size differences), whereupon they drop their weapons, turn tail, and flee into their lair, terrified within an inch of their lives.\n\nNiccolo used up about half his spells for that day, as well as a scroll, but damn, was it worth it!\n",

        "text": "So in the last dungeon I managed allow our party to bypass a dungeon and boss entirely and rob the place blind. Understandably our DM was ticked, dungeons take a lot of planning. \n\nAfter a long airship flight to Dwarven lands we land in Hammerfall, a city on the east coast. We manage to track down a man who has information we need, and we chase him around Hammerfall. This goes on for literally fifteen minutes until we have him cornered in a gnome run brewery. Big assembly lines producing ale by the bottle.\n\nOf course it's a trap. Our 'informant' bribed the owner into letting him stay there with his minions for a while. We roll initiative and the battle gets underway. My character, a pixie bard named Lilli, can fly so she starts playing her music out of reach of the melee-centric battle. \n\nThe bad guys are on the ropes, I'm hovering over the bottling machine healing our fighter and avenger. A small smile comes across our DM's face when the Informant's turn hits. \n\n \"He pulls out a wand and attempts to paralyze Lilli.\" He rolls a 19, his bonuses giving him a 27 to hit. And my Pixie Bard is paralyzed. It was only at my turn I was informed of my predicament.\n\nShe was hovering over the bottling machine, and since paralysis would ground her, she fell right in. \n\nThe DM announces to the other party members that I am unable to fight, but doesn't tell them why. He hands me a quickly written note explaining to me exactly why. \"Lilli falls into the vat. Unable to move she is quickly sucked into the depths of the machine, The dark interior of the pipes carry her quickly to the other end of the plant, where high pressure forces squeeze her through the mouth of a bottle a little to small to fit her (Causing 12 damage). The bottle is capped off and sent down the line. She will drown in 10 rounds.\"\n\nThis only makes me laugh. I scribble three words on the paper and hand it back. \"Amulet of Breathing\"\n\nThis of course peeves him off more. After another round he passes me another note. \"The owner of this brewery takes shortcuts, you swallow some of the ale and notice it is not yet fermented or flavored. Your bottle comes up to a spot in line where a label is stuck to the side. The outside of the label is simple, displaying the name of the company and the type of brew. \"Sweet honey orange ale\". On the inside of the label however is an arcane rune. Once the label is stuck to the bottle it starts to glow. Pain shoots through every part of your body as the arcane powers flow through the bottle. The bottle exits the area and is put in a box with 23 other bottles, which is sealed and loaded onto a crate, bound for the western coast of the continent. The rune's function is to ferment and flavor the liquid inside the bottle, which includes your blood. Congratulations, your blood is now magically fermented and you now sweat sweet sticky honey, your skin is that of an orange.\n\nP.S. Since your blood/alcohol content is now 100% you now have a permanent -4 to dex, wiz, and int. And you now look like a delicious piece of fruit. Good luck.\"\n\nI am reasonably ticked off right now, considering my character now has a permanent penalty and fears being eaten as a pub snack. But this punishment wasn't just for me. After the encounter, the party figures out that I must've fell in and was bottled up and sent away, sending the party on an unnecessary 2 week detour across a continent to track down their bard. Since, of course, She was carrying a plot relevant item.\n\nJust goes to show no creative deed goes unpunished, but hey, playing an orange, eternally drunk pixie might be fun.",

        "text": "Hullo /r/gametales. Been a while hasn't it? Been a While since I've played, to be honest, which was a damn shame!\n\n---\n\nThe Party:\n\n* Kizmet, a Roguish Gnome [Rogue, Acrobat Archetype.]\n* Ianya, a Half-Elven Huntress, accompanied by Andarta, her ward [Hunter Class, Young Bronze Dragon for Animal Companion, can polymorphed into a Raven 4/Day.]\n* Suriyan, an Elven Cleric of Elberoth, the Lord of Shadow. [NPC, but oh so very useful.]\n* An unknown man from the Free Cities [A Brawler, Steel-breaker archetype. Name not remembered.]\n* A Talon-Knight of Dragonholme [A Barbarian, funnily enough. Name not remembered.]\n\n---\n\nIt's been an interesting six months. Rauren won it's Freedom, the Final son of the Vargan Emperor perishing in holy fire (and good riddence.) Svetlana, ex-party member, sits pretty atop the Throne as Queen, ruling alongside Cal Thurr, who's life we saved previously.\n\nThe legal situation is in flux, as all manner of laws are examined, then altered, scrapped, replaced, or left be depending. Something that has been scrapped, however, is slavery.\n\nIt's banned. Not just the trade but the institution itself. Most people agree with this.\n\nSome, however, do not.\n\n---\n\n**Journal of Ianya.**\n\n**Mithrandies is either incredibly obstinate or has been hit on the head several times since we saw him last.** *He is complaining that he has invested an vast amount of time and money into his slaves, and, thus, should be allowed to keep them.*\n\n*(I should note: Every other time he has received us, there has always been at least one slave about. Today, this is not the case, and I'm vaguely pleased by it.)*\n\n*It's a ridiculous proposition, and I half suspect he knows it. In any case, he's taken the liberty of moving most of his 'livestock' as he so charmingly refers to people, back to his native Kalag. There is one, however, whom he is rather less fond of carting off.*\n\n*He refers to her as 'Toy'. Innately powerful, she's been his since she was a child. Magically powerful, of that I have no doubt: She was the one that moved us across onto *Black Lady.* She is also extremely beautiful. I have no doubt she's been his pleasure slave.*\n\n*Some days I wonder why I have not yet killed the man. Some days I wonder why others have not done so already.*\n\n*In any case, he was not willing to relinquish 'Toy' so easily. Kizmet began buttering him up, as Kizmet has grown adept at (although I was biting my tongue at points.) Eventually, Kizmet was able to negotiate her purchase: A land Grant from the Rauren Crown worth 100,000 Gold Pieces: A Vast sum.*\n\n*I believe it was worth it, however when she asked for some privacy, head still bent towards the floor. Kizmet now has her as a retainer, for her knowledge on all things Magical and Arcane. We will need it, I suspect. And she will want to choose a name. I, for one, refuse to use her former 'endearment' again...*\n\n**Meeting with the Queen, or, rather, Svetlana.** *A message for aid from one of the Northern Holds, about two weeks by horse: Sudden Blights of Crops, the Lord acting strange, whispers of magic and spell. Perhaps a fool errand. Perhaps not. Even if, I've spent too long in the Palace, living off Svetlana's generosity. We'll leave tomorrow.*\n\n*Should note: This Lord is the Second cousin to that despicable Dural Suratal, who caused us so much pain and torment (and in fact shares the last name.) Hopefully we will not have to kill another member of the Suratal Family...*\n\n**Arrived in the Hold's Village.** *Village Hetman (Head Man) has been most helpful (and the Cider is quite good, I must say.) Problems seemed to begin when the Lord returned from a Tourney four weeks ago. Stayed within his hold for three, four days or so, then rode down to the Village, and demanded that the Village's 'Spring Queen' return with him. Said 'Spring Queen' is, a maiden (supposedly) of five-and-ten (not that I have ever seen the appeal of Maidenhood myself.) Since then, none has been allowed into the Lord's Hold, and the Crop Blights began soon after.*\n\n*Once the Hetman had left, I did some scouting of the Hold from the air. Main hall, two wings, courtyard. Fairly standard. Some form of Green Flame crackling around the West Wing. This isn't a wasted trip. Something is wrong here.*\n\n*Kizmet concerned about the number of flies buzzing about. It was, after all, winter. Now he mentions it, they are slightly larger than normal flies. Decision made to approach Castle tomorrow and attempted entry by Kizmet, Brawler and Talon-Knight, whilst I attempt interior scouting...*\n\n**Gods.** *They were allowed in. No servants, they said, only guards, and fewer than there should be. Scared, apparently, out of their depth, and with large, ovular boils.*\n\n*The Lord is alive, remembers Kizmet from his actions during Cassapin's Tourney (as that grisly time is known.) But sluggish and wan, as if feverish and inebriated at once. The Girl is alive, apparently, bruised but alive, apparently his wife. (He performed the wedding himself, which is, apparently, legal. Must speak to Svetlana.) Reported that the Hold was under quarantine, and that the Hold's apothecary was '...busy.'*\n\n*The same response was given when Kizmet asked where the Apothcary was being busy.*\n\n*His throne room, Kizmet reports, had a vertiable feats layed out. At least, it would have been a feast weeks ago. Now it belongs to the flies. He also reports that the Girl (Melanie by name) was able to pass on a message, to the meaning of 'help me'.*\n\n*Suryian reports the the Servants are dead, and saw evidence of... Something... growing inside them.*\n\n*For my part, I found the Hold's Grain Stores: Deliberately spoiled, water cast over them to rot. Flies everywhere, and... Grubs. Grubs as long as my forearm.*\n\n*And now the Talon-Knight has grown one of those boils Kizmet spoke of, and his strength and will haved been sapped. I do not begrude him.*\n\n*I am warming to the idea of burning this place to the ground...*\n\n**We lanced the Talon-Knight's boil with a dagger.** *We expected Pus. We found a Fly impaled upon the blade. We're heading to the West Wing tonight, avoiding the guards. Poor bastards...*\n\n**The Library is untouched.** *I still feel the urge to vomit. Have you ever seen mouldy bread? Of course you have. Imagine you built a Wing of a Noble's hold out of Mouldy bread, then upsized the mould and Spores until it was solid enough to walk on. It coated the floor, walls, ceiling. The spores the size of your fist, dangling from stalks so the entire corridor was covered. I am glad I brought my axe. You had to stoop in place, turn sideways in others. The flies, those damnable flies were everywhere.*\n\n*We discovered what happened to the Servants. We were attacked by Giant Moths. They had these Waxy surfaces upon their thoraxes... Looked like faces. Individual's faces. And they had these things in their wings that screamed. When they died they exploded into this black ichor. The Talon-Knight managed to swallow some.*\n\n*It's stuck in his throat, he's vomiting and vomiting and it's won't come up. He's barely breathing.* \n\n*We've found the Lord's Library. Carry some of the Fungus across the Threshold and it burns into nothingness, and we don't know why, or who did it. A few items of interest: Some Magical Sword, an Magical Astrarium, some book that won't allow itself to be opened, the Skull of some giant bird, beak inlaid with gold, seemingly naturally-occuring.*\n\n*We're leaving the Talon-Knight here. He can barely stand as he is. We have to press on, this has to end...*\n\n**Well, it wasn't the Apothecary.** *We found the Apothecary. Or rather, we found his laboratory, a corpse, crudely skinned, face missing, and his journal. Within it we find references to a different Woman: Pale Skin, Black Hair, Blue eyes. Arrived a few months back, left whilst the Lord was away at the Tourney the Hetman referenced. Arrived from the North, apparently, reportedly from beyond the Spine.*\n\n*His journal made vague references to 'suspicions' but was apparently to afraid to name them within his private journal.*\n\n*Something to note: All the doors in this wing were left open, except the one to his laboratory. Trapped, of course. Kizmet was able to disarm it: Had we merely blundered in, we would be on fire. Kizmet responds that the stuff (a whole Cauldron's worth) is like Alchemists's Fire, but more potent, almost impossible to put out, that it stuck to you. May be useful.*\n\n*Onwards, once more...*\n\n**It's Over.** *We left the Apothecary's office to find Melanie staring down the corridor, stating that the Lord wished to speak to us, while desperately gesturing for us to leave. I polymorphed to get a look into the room through an arrowslit.*\n\n*I... The air swarmed with flies, with more of the Moths. I caught glimpsed of the Lord, and something that looked like it was a moth, except it couldn't fly, and the floor laiad with bodies.*\n\n*I must confess I'd had enough by this point. I went to grab the cauldron. By the time I'd returned, some sort of battle was in full swing.*\n\n*\"Everyone Out!\" was enough to get our people out. I must confess I didn't wait for Melanie: I didn't dare. The backdraft burnt me. I didn't care. It was done.*\n\n*Melanie... Well, it wasn't Melanie at all. The woman mentioned the Apothecary's note was... Wearing her was the wrong word. It was if a coat dediced to put on a human for a while. It ran out of the room screaming, half Melanie, half thing.*\n\n*It had some choice words for us before it went, but it fled Melanie. Suryian was able to heal her, thankfully. Her body, at least. We cannot speak for her mind.*\n\n*That... Thing. It called itself 'The Larder Queen'. It's not the last we'll see of it, if only because we'll hunt it.*\n\n*The Guards were very grateful: That thing could listen to them if it dained to, through the boils. They're organising the burning of the fungus. I've reminded them to not breath it in if they can all avoid it. Kizmet reports that the 'Lord' was a construct, made of Wax. The Lord's likely been dead for weeks.*\n\n*Having gone over the Apothecary's journal some more, it seems that it was hunting Dural Suratal's work, or at least some part of it. It's called us it's siblings: It's Fateless then. It could have been anything, the Gods themselves having no power over her fate, and it chose... This? Sickening.*\n\n*According to the Apothecary's journal, she was interested in astronomy as well but that's not much to go on.*\n\n*We'll have to head North to the main Suratal hold: Much of Dural's early research is held there.*\n\n*Today, I'll have a letter sent off to Stornbridge, infroming him that one of his vassals has died without heir, and one widow of dubious legality.*\n\n*Oh yes, and get drunk. Very drunk. I almost want to vomit...*\n\n**Reception at the Suratal Hold is about as friendly as could be expected: Not in the slightest.** *We were able to gain access to Dural's notes: A full two crates, seemingly undisturbed. We were able to find some Star-maps which could be of use. The Suratal family refuse to allow us to take the Notes with us, nor agree to move them to Stornbridge, where the City authorites hold his later works, so we've made copies.*\n\n*They're welcome to make their bed, just as long as they'll lie in it eventually. No plagues or blights to speak of. A Single giant Moth was found in an Almhouse, Kizmet informs, but it was practically burnt to the ground afterwards.*\n\n*We'll begin the return trip, to Rauren City, tomorrow. We've had enough of this damnable family, their cursed members and their distant hospitality.*\n\n*I miss Severyn. Hopefully I'll see him soon enough...*",

        "text": "So, we are playing this campaign during the clone wars or rather the start of them. I was a kind of psychopathic soldier who used to be a security guard on some backwater planet, a scoundrel with more skills and guts you could imagine by looking at him and a jedi dangerously skirting to the dark side. We were in the Geonosis arena, fighting against an army of droids and a dark jedi in the service of a crime lord. Of course, once the sith came into the picture we were utterly screwed...Or not? After some very half assed tries of our scoundrel convincing the sith we didn't have what she was looking for (We totally did and it was right in the arena) our jedi makes two, I repeat, two in a row natural 20s first force slamming her so hard to take out half of her hp, then burying her in the rubble making a whole lot of the arena fall on her! Next, we regroup, rearm and take a whole bunch of clones with us, trying to finally defeat these bastards. After a brief fight with the crimelord, who had a flamethrower, rocket launchers and who knows what else, and the sith who had better lucks, our scoundrel finds himself trapped in the elevator with the two of them! He threatens to blow himself up with a thermal detonator, destroying the precious datalink they sought all along! WHen the elevator starts going down me and the jedi jump on the elevator's roof. The Scoundrel gets forcechoked and barely survives and decides to play dead, while the crime lord notices that someone is on the roof. He shoots upwards thankfully missing while the sith starts cutting the floor to escape. The jedi has the same idea and cuts the roof before the sith while the scoudrel pushes the crimelord over the whole, making him fall down! I shoot at the both them and the sith drops the scoundrel down the elevator shaft, hurting her very badly. The crimelord then shoots a grappling hook to get up but the scoundrel cuts the rope, making him fall to his presumed death. We then drop down a thermal detonator down the elevator shaft from the double hole, hoping to never see them again.",

        "text": "The events within this story happened a week ago, when some friends and I started a new Pathfinder campaign after a long hiatus. At this point, everyone but the GM has only played one other campaign, while the GM had years and years of experience with D&amp;D, but not Pathfinder. This is the story of how our friend decided he would rather play a single player game, and how we used that mistake to our benefit.\n\nThe campaign itself is a homebrew by the GM, with a lot of improvisation by him and the PCs. In this situation, we decided to do an evil campaign, with lots of random cruelty for laughs. The characters:\n\n* Nypsol Drath - A male dhampir necromancer with a taste for gnomes. Generally uncaring about life, with an exception for his grand-niece and a young ninja who travels with them.\n\n* Shrek 2 - yes, I know. A male Orc Monk, who was played by another person while the creator was out of town, so his personality has yet to be fully fleshed out. In this story, he's generally just \"that guy\", doing whatever he wants.\n\n* Morgan - a female human ninja. Trained by a clandestine group of assassins, she was introduced to Nypsol after her parents promised him the rights to her body and soul in event of her death, without her knowledge. Can't seem to ever make sneak roles.\n\n* Anaya Drath - A female Undine (half water elemental) Bard. The grand niece of Nypsol, she enjoys singing Smash Mouth and stealing things, especially from dwarves. Very knowledgeable due to years of traveling and general no-do-goodery.\n\n* John Wick - A male Ifrit sorcerer. Being made of mostly fire, he is a purveyor of arson and arson accessories. Very quick to improvise solutions, often in lew of more obvious, easier ones, but it works.\n\nThis collection of individuals of ill respute landed at a small port city, which none of them cared to find the name of, after a few months of travel at sea. The first order of business seems to be to find an inn and see what there is to do in this fine city. Well, Shrek 2 has other plans, and abandons the party to \"go conquer the slums\". In the time it takes the party to both find an inn an subsequently abandon it, he has managed to find a new home for him to live in.\n\nIn this fine abode, he finds the remains or two poor humans and decides that it's not worth investigating, and moves in. He pretty much just searches for loot and picks fights with the neighbors as we carry on with the game. This will be important later.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party has decided that inns are for losers (and were chased out for trying to steal from the patrons), broken into the home of a lovely gnomish couple, convince them we are selling insurance, and killed them fairly easily. Nypsol, with points in cooking, makes a nice gnome stew for dinner. This will not be important at all.\n\nAt this point, we decide we need to actually... do something. So, a trip to the local guard's keep was in order. After casing the joint and realizing an attack would be doomed to fail, we decide to instead look for a bounty to do. Instead of reading them all we immediately select the highest paying one: The son of one of the royal elven families currently residing in the city was murdered a month ago, and the authorities had made no progress in catching the killer. \n\nThe only lead we could find was the bodyguard of said noble son, who was fired after failing at his job of keeping the elf safe. After some well done knowledge roles by our bard we discovered the home on this man, and of course let ourselves in to find him taking a drunken nap. Some rope was procured and used to tie the man up, and we woke him up with a few slaps. \n\nUnfortunately for us, and more so for our new friend, he had no useful information that he hadn't already told the guards who had questioned him that day. Nypsol, frustrated and getting bored, slices the mans throat and presents the idea to simply turn this man's corpse in and say he is the killer. John Wick brings up the very good point that the people who questioned the man would know he didn't do it. Well, perhaps we could use another corpse?\n\nYou see, at this point Shrek had met his neighbors: 4 hobos. Or so he thought. After punching one in the face as soon as the door to their slum-house opened, he discovered that two of them were in fact a druid and a rogue, and all of them were 3 levels higher than he. A fireball from the druid, and a lot of stabbing and puching later, the rogue and our monk buddy are dead. The player simply left at this point, not caring that he had killed our other friends character (don't worry, we're going to let him be alive again).\n\nSo, we decided to visit Shrek's house and regroup with him, only to find his corpse. Well, we weren't to attached to him anyway, and quickly came up with a plan to turn in his corpse to the guards. We were surprised to find a group of hobos nearby, who nearly attacked us before we convinced them that the Orc who had attacked them was a wanted serial killer. Some nice bluff roles later, they totally believe us, and had been convinced to collaborate with us and tell the guards about how Shrek had killed their friend.\n\nNow all we had to do was convince the guards that this orc was the culprit, and then collect the reward. The GM roles a 1 on the guy's check against our bluff. We are lauded as heroes by the royal elves, given 1000 gold to split and a magical item of our choice. They never did find the dead bodygaurd, or the remains of the gnome couple now stuffed under a bed, or even the real killer. But we got paid, so who cares?",

        "text": "So I ran a Dark Heresy 1e one shot today. I devised a quickgen system and players were Inquisitorial sleeper agents in the lower parts of a Hive City. I advised each player to take a Forbidden Lore skill. We had:\n\n- Ivan, a Worker who took Forbidden Lore: Cults and was mostly into hitting enemies with a wrench\n- Jared The Fox, a Ganger who took Forbidden Lore: Warp and was the social character of the group\n- Rodrick, a Worker who took Forbidden Lore: Xenos and was the tech guy of the group (and the only one to take literacy too)\n- Patrick, an Enforcer who took Forbidden Lore: Mutants and was mostly into bullying people and shooting them\n- Garvel, an Enforcer who was the only one not to take Forbidden Lore. He basically tried to make an Assassin\n- Ulf, a Ganger who took Forbidden Lore: Daemons and was by default the party \"medic\" and slippery bugger\n\nSo we time in with our players before they are \"woken up\" as agents. Jared is in a night club called the Nightingale (which my players quickly decided was a gay bar) and he realised he'd lost his cred stick. He talked his way into the security office to check the camera feed and see who might have stolen it. He found out he'd just dropped it by the door but on a separate screen he noticed something had happened in the alley outside. A cloaked figure cut a person to shreds with a peculiar-looking blade. Jared \"wakes up\", punches in the code to wake up his comrades, copies and deletes the video footage and then he meets up with his allies.\n\nEveryone rolls their respective Forbidden Lore upon seeing the video feed: Rodrick gets a decent success and deduces that blade is definitely of Eldar design, given its obscene sharpness and the way it is used. However, Ivan gets 100 - a critical fail. So I give him an \"anti-success\". He becomes convinced that this is the work of a Khornate Chaos Cult called the Bloodfathers. Even though OC the entire party know this isn't true, IC they go along with not the Xenos expert but the Cult expert, causing such outbursts as \"How are Eldar going to get to the bottom of a Hive City anyway? Magical space portals?\" (The joke, if you don't know, is that that is precisely how Eldar travel)\n\nSo despite mounting evidence to suggest that the nemesis here is a crew of Dark Eldar (poison weapons, torture dungeons, lightning-fast foes, a webway portal) the party remains adamant that this is the work of some cult, rather than the manipulations of Dark Eldar. For some reason they seemed more willing to trust the guy whose theories got more outlandish at every turn than the guy who had one answer for everything: \"Aliens\"\n\nIt turned out through the course of the session that a fairly weak Dark Eldar crew was selling weapons to a group of dissident mutants in exchange for access to slaves but when the supply of slaves had dried up, the deal broke down and the two groups went into a conflict. The PCs were present to witness the mutant \"army\" all board the Dark Eldar craft and see it vanish into the Webway, solving both problems.\n\nAnd the Inquisitorial Agents go back to \"sleep\" **convinced** that what they saw was the work of a Chaos Cult and not... Aliens.",

For more information about the characters, check out my first [report.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2yfysg/battlereport1_kadai/)*\n-----------------------------------------------\n**The Stratos Campaign - Battle-Report #002 \nAs written by Deathwatch Librarian Janos Carstein\nDate: 9870815.M41\nLocation: The Undeniable Vengeance, orbiting G8FC1, code name: “GYR”**\n\n**Mission: Exploration of GM14C1**\nPre-Mission Notes:\n\nWith the knowledge that several, minimum of two, Greenskin clans were operating in the region, the Kill-Team wasted no time and immediately headed towards the next moon in the triangulation relay system mentioned earlier. \n\nDuring our time traveling, Brother Torox and Brother Kadai mended the few scratches our persons and belongings had suffered during our amusing trifle with the greenskins on GI16C1. The repairs on the Undeniable Vengeance itself have made progress, and we no longer deem it neccessary to have an extra generator tied up in the lifesupport system, instead choosing to reinstall it into one of the Stormravens. Alas, we are still without Astropaths. No matter the condition of the Undeniable Vengeance herself, we remain isolated, with nothing but the skill of our brethren and faith in the Emperor to rely upon. \n\nAs we closed in on the moon, I detected no psychic presence on it's surface, nor did the spirit of Sanguinius choose to bless me with omen or portents. To err is not in my nature, so I felt confident that the Kill-Team was to endure little threat to their immediate safety whilst on the moon.  \n\n**Mission Report**\nLEADER: *Battle-Brother Marbas*\n\nOATH: Oath of the Astartes\n\n**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the Deep Space scanners and link them to the NOC\n\n**SECONDARY OBJECTIVE** – Purifiy the moon of any xeno presence\n\n**TERITARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the firing platforms\n\nKnowing that there could be Greenskin forces present, we circled the moon and scouted it thoroughly from our Stormraven before landing. As nothing unusual or noteworthy was detected, the Stormraven dropped us off at the main complex before landing itself some distance away, a security measure should hostile forces manage to escape from us out of the complex. \n\nAt the door, brother Kadai tried to gain access to the complex's security measures from the outside, but was unable to. In fact, he was completely locked out of the system in it's entirely. This would be alarming if imperial machinary had done this to any lowly technician. The fact that it had happen to our Techpriest was cause for even more concern.\nWe did retain physical access to the complex however, and Brother Marbas ordered us to follow his lead and advance with caution. \n\nOnce inside, darkness enveloped us, although it was easily pierced by our Astartes senses and equipment. One corridor remained lit, and it was quite obvious that however controlled this complex wanted us to follow it. Not wanting to stumble into an ambush, the Kill-team tried to seek other paths to follow, but not progress was made. Eventually, Marbas ordered us to follow the lit path and to steel ourselves for an ambush.\n\nHowever, I doubt any of us was truly prepared for what we were about to discover. \n\nWe walked through the corridor for some time, it's twisting turns leading us deeper and towards the center of the complex. Eventually, we enter what seemed to be some sort of reception or waiting room, and a voice called out in greeting from the speakers. Brother Marbas identified us as part of the Imperial Inquisition, and commanded the speaker to identifiy itself. It's name was Extros, and it was an AI. \n\nIt wasn't immediately hostile, nor did it even seem aware of it's own heretical status. When faced with an enemy that doesn't know it's an enemy, one's first order of business is to extract as much information as possible from it. \n\nIt told us that it was one of many AI:s in the system. When asked how many 'brethren' is had in total within the entire Stratos system, it answered with well over 7000. We do not know the exact nature of these 'brethren' however. It could just be the number of 'pings' it gets back from the other system when it sends out a call, or it could be 7000 fully functioning AI:s. What is certain is that there was one AI on each of the other three moons in the triangulation system. It had recently lost contact with it's 'Big Brother' on  GI16C1, and that it was through this 'Big Brother' that it communicated with the others. It claim to feel lonely, but I have my doubts that an AI is truly capable of such emotions. It was more than likely a ploy to try and evoke sympathy.\n\n\nIt was also made evident that the deep space scanners could not be used without the AI:s interferance whilst it remained operational. Throughout the conversation I made several obfuscated attempts at attaining information on any of the AI:s weaknesses, but such information was witheld. Whether it did this because it picked up on my ill intent, or if it was simple being cautious, remains unknown.\n\nIt made a request of us. Somehow, Greenskins had been able to trap the AI at the NOC, and Extros wanted us to free it's Big Brother so that it could once again communicate with the rest of it's brethren. In it's presence, we gregariously accepted, lest this enemy would find out that it was indeed an enemy. With a bargain apparently struck, we headed back to the Undeniable Vengeance to discuss our next course of action. Some arguments were had, but eventually we decided to head to the third moon and gather more information on the situation before a final decision was made. \n\n**SUMMARY: **\n\n**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the Deep Space scanners and link them to the NOC - *FAILED*\n\n**SECONDARY OBJECTIVE** – Purifiy the moon of any xeno presence – *FAILED* (AI still alive)\n\n**TERITARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the firing platforms – *FAILED*\n\nAdded Inventory:\nNothing\n\nLost Inventory:\nNothing\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mission: Exploration of GM14C1**\n\nPre-Mission Notes:\n\nWorry weighed heavily upon me as we made our way to GM14C1. A few members of the Kill-Team did not seem so hesitant to cooperate with the AI as I would have liked, among them our leader, Brother Marbas. I had hopes that our journey to the last moon in the triagulation relay system would clear this issue up, and that any cooperation with heretical elements would be ruled out. The spirit of Sanguinius saw fit to bless me with visions of a Green horde awaiting us at GM14C1, and I eagerly awaited to take my frustrations out on the Greenskins. \n\n**Mission Report:**\nLEADER: Battle-Brother Marbas\n\nOATH: Oath of the Astartes\n\n**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE** – Find out if there is an AI presence on the moon.\n\n**SECONDARY OBJECTIVE** – Purify the moon of any xeno prsence\n\n**TERITARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the Deep Space scanners and link them to the Undeniable Vengeance\n\n**TERITARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the firing platforms\n\nLittle of note happened when we arrived at this moon's complex. We encounter some minor resistance from a small greenskin force station there, but they were easily dispatched. By now it was obvious that the orks in black were larger and stronger, whilst the orks in yellow were the ones meddling with imperial technology. We tried to interrogate one of the greenskins, but the translator had some trouble with ork-speech, so no information could be extracted.\n\nFrom pict-recorders and pict-screen within the complex, Brother Kadai determined that there was a large ork convoy heading out from the other, smaller, complex on the opposite side of the moon. The decision was made to take our Stormraven, intercept and destroy the ork force before heading to the other complex.\n\nThe convoy consisted of several ork trucks and we estimated somewhere around 200 individuals. We initiated the battle with a  highly successful strafing run from our Stormraven. After that, Brother Kestyr was dispatched on one truck to deal with a larger ork, a suspected nob, who appeared to be leading the force. Myself and Brother Marbas were dispatched to another truck whilst Brother Sarlock remained upon the Stormraven, which at this point was being piloted by Brother Kadai, to lay down fire from above and chase down stragglers. The operation was a resounding success, and within minutes only a single truckload of orks remained, stranded near the wreckage of another truck. \n\nMe, Brother Marbas and Brother Kestyr was on ground and en route towards the remaining hostiles. Brother Kestyr, somewhat foolishly, jumped ahead and landed in the middle of the 30 or so Orks, rendering himself completely surrounded, and took up a defensive position. As my Brother and I rushed to his aid, firing bolter and psychic lightning with all our might, Brother Marbas came under heavy ork fire which pierced his armor and knocked him to the ground. It was in this moment, as I was about to conjure yet another lightning bolt, that Sanguinius own divine light bursted forth from my person, rendering anyone nearby utterly blind. After that, it was a simple matter of rounding up and exterminating the helpless greenskins.\n\nAfter our tumble with the convoy, we quickly made our way towards the planetary relays to see if any damage had been done. To our surprise we located the moon's AI which had been trapped, presumably by greenskins, in one of the relays and had been rendered helpless. We then decided to link the scanners to the Undeniable Vengeance, leaving the AI there to rot, as we departed the moon's surface.\n\n**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE** – Find out if there is an AI presence on the moon. - *COMPLETED*\n\n**SECONDARY OBJECTIVE** – Purify the moon of any xeno presence - *COMPLETED*\n\n**TERITARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the Deep Space scanners and link them to the Undeniable Vengeance - *COMPLETED*\n\n**TERITARY OBJECTIVE** – Secure the firing platforms - *COMPLETED*\n\nAdded Inventory\nNothing\n\nLost Inventory\n207 Bolter rounds\nAll the ammunition for one of the Stormraven's assault cannon.\n\nPost-Mission developments\nOnce back at the ship, we had a choice to make. We could simply rely on the scanner we just secured from GM14C1, or we could liberate the AI trapped in the NOC and gain full access to the triangulation relay system. The first option would render us half-blinded, but it would not require that we commit any heresies by directly aiding enemies of the imperium. The second option gave us full access, but was heretical in nature. Myself and Brother Kestyr argued the first option, with some support from Brotehr Kadai. Brother Sarlock, with some support from Brother Marbas, argued the second. The discussion came to a halt, and Brother Marbas, in his position as First Among Equals, broke the stalemate and decided to restore the AI at the NOC.  \n\nAnd so it came to be. We traveled back to the NOC and restored Extros much larger and more intelligent brother, which granted us a slew of information and full access to the relay system. I must adPart of this information was that a Mechanicum ship had been sighted deeper in the system. Some members of the Kill-Team wanted to hail the ship, but I cautioned them from making contact with the Mechanicum using an AI as a middle man. \n\n*Fortunately, they heeded my warnings.*\n",

Anyways, we rejoin our group after a night of terrible dreams. Just be warned, this is ***LONG***\n\n\nA rabble that could only be compared to a gaggle of geese was swiftly awakening the party. As they descended the stairs, a large mob had formed in the bar, with the town blacksmith being pinned to the wall. Vasari tapped one of the villagers and asked what was going on. The villager replied that the moon was stuck in the sky (It was morning), and the blacksmith was found to be a werewolf. \n\nRizzax took it upon himself to bless some water and attempt to cure the blacksmith, to no avail. Soon after, the host of Avacyn barged through the door with two Thraben militiamen. They hauled the blacksmith off in manacles, and the priest attempted to calm the townsfolk to the best of his abilities. It was at this moment that Rizzax realized that Uunkalo was missing, and left a crudely written note depicting a wolf, fire, and a happy face. He rolled his eyes and tugged on Vasari's robe, showing him the note.\n\n\"Ah, he's gone hunting, has he? Well, we might as well go gather some cooking supplies for when he gets back.\"\n\nThe five adventurers decided to go to the marketplace and spend the day somewhat leisurely. The first stop of the day was the general store, and the hunter's stall, in order to acquire small game and herbs, but after that, everyone split up. Tattered Pages and Vasari went to the mage's shop, while Evard went to the Pet store, and Loch visited the swordsmith. Rizzax, however, decided to investigate the Blacksmith's house.\n\n\nAs the elemental and wizard walked into the store, a short, portly gentlemen welcomed them and  presented his wares to them. The only thing that caught either of their attentions was a rather frail looking skull with engravings on it.\n\n\"Ah, a fine choice, I purchased this from a traveling salesman a while back, but nobody has dared purchase it, all I know is that there is some sort of magical property to it.\"\n\nTattered Pages mulled over it and bought the skull, he quickly discerned that it was an angel skull, and if given a small blood sacrifice, it would allow the user to see 1 hour into the future. The two happily left the shop knowing that they could now use this to their advantage.\n\n\nLoch decided that Elbrus was not a trustworthy weapon, and he decided to purchase an iron sword. But even then, it was not enough, he requested that he may use the forge to coat the sword in silver, the shopkeeper obliged and let him forge the sword for the next several hours.\n\n\nEvard had walked into the store and frowned at most of the pets, but one stuck out to him the most, a black cat with piercing green eyes. He bought the cat immediately and walked outside the store, to see Rizzax sneaking outside the Blacksmith's house, with a small box in hand.\n\n\nRizzax had thought that the Thraben would most likely torture the blacksmith until he confessed to crimes he didn't commit, and he wanted none of that. The voice in his head told him that this was moronic, and that he should let the stranger suffer. He nearly broke down, but powered through the insanity. He had to save the blacksmith.\n\nThe front door to the Blacksmith's house was completely demolished, leaving the one-room home wide open. He crept inside, and looked all around. His tools lined the walls, as well as a bedroll with a half-eaten rabbit nearby, as well as a messy desk in the corner. Rizzax first walked over to the desk and scrounged through the papers, trying to find anything important. Mostly material receipts and work orders. One, however, caught his eye. It mentioned three people, Ironfang, Silverpelt, and Moon Hunter. They apparently meet at a place called Waypoint, outside of town. Rizzax pocketed the note and continued his search.\n\nThe bedroll was the next stop in the search. Rizzax moved the bedroll out of the way and found a faded key. He took the key and begin to look around the house for any safes or doors that may reveal secrets, to no avail. At last, he moved the desk out of the way and discovered a small opening in the back of the desk, with a small lockbox inside. He knew immediately that this was it. He deftly retrieved the box from the nail-ridden alcove and used the key to open it up. The only things inside of it were a vial of clear liquid, wolfsbane, another key, and the blacksmith's life savings.\n\nRizzax left the coins in the alcove, but removed the other contents. He relocked the box and unlocked it with the black key. When he opened it, new contents appeared. This time, there was a large, yellow fang and a large bottle of blood. Rizzax uncorked the bottle and the foul scent made him rear back. He placed the previous contents into this new container, as well as the notes about Waypoint. He thought for a minute, and changed the box back to it's normal state and placed the rabbit in the first compartment for later. He then exited the house, but not before grabbing a blacksmith hammer.\n\nAfter meeting up with Evard, the two go to the priest and ask where they brought Ironfang. He told them that he was kept in captivity beneath the church, but was guarded by Thraben militiamen. Evard scoffed and marched through the church, with Rizzax in tow, and they pushed their way though the Thraben to talk to Ironfang. He was alone in a cell, with his back facing the bars. Rizzax decided to open up the box and toss the rabbit into his cell. Ironfang perked up and turned to face Rizzax. The kobold cowered behind Evard and whispered into his ear. Evard nodded and spoke to the werewolf.\n\n\"We know that you and two others in town are werewolves, we just want to know who so we can save them. We don't want anyone innocent to get hurt.\"\n\nIronfang grinned and came close. In a low, hushed voice, he told Evard that Silverpelt is a mercenary who has been going in and out of the mansion just as we have, and Moon Hunter makes her living capturing animals during her hunts and selling them as pets. The adventurers nodded and assured him that they would be safe.\n\nAfter the detective work was finished, everyone except for Loch had regrouped to try and find Silverpelt. They eventually found him outside the Inn, drinking ale. He waved at them, as they had met him before, in the forest and in the mansion. As Evard explained everything to him, his expression changed from content to concerned. He got up and left for the pet shop to warn Moon Hunter, and that they should go to Waypoint tonight.\n\nLoch finally finished his blade, and returned to the Inn, and soon after, Uunkalo returns from his hunt with a bear in tow.\n\n***Continued in the comments*** \n",

        "text": "This story comes from the game \"This War of Mine\". You control a small group of civilians who get caught up in a civil war and have to scavenge, barter and sometimes steal to survive through the battle. It's an extremely compelling game. \n\n**SPOILERS AHEAD. TRUST ME, GET THIS GAME AND TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.**\n\nWith games like these, food and medicine are treasured resources, and are equally as rare. The supermarket would have these items, but people say it's under military control and may be dangerous. Well, desperate times, desperate measures. I take Marko, my best scavenger, the crowbar and head off.\n\nThe supermarket doesn't seem to be so busy at the front. There's a couple of piles containing wood and components around the entrance. Useful stuff, but that's not what I'm after. I enter the front doors.\n\nThen I heard a voice coming from the next room.\n\n \"That's a pretty name for such a pretty face.\" \n \n\"Thank you.\"\n\nSomeone was here. There was a door separating me and the others, so I took a peek through the keyhole. It was a soldier and a woman, a survivor like myself. The woman was rummaging through a trolley as the soldier talked.\n\n\"Looking for something?\"\n\n \"Just some food.\"\n\n\"Food?\" The soldier advances on the woman. \"Poor girl I can give you food for a favour.\"\n\n \"No. I cannot.\"\n\n\"Just come with me babe. We'll dine and have some fun.\"\n\n'Crap,' I thought, 'He's not going to rape her, is he? What kind of a fucked up person would do that?'\n\nMy crowbar was at the ready, but I hesitated. He had a rifle, Marko didn't. If that soldier got a single shot off on Marko, that's it. Marko would die like an animal and the group would lose their scavenger. 'It's just a game.' I reasoned 'Nobody's really getting raped.' But I couldn't move away from the door. My conscience was torn between saving the woman and staying alive.\n\n\"No, I'm afraid I can't.\"\n\n\"The hell you can't!\" The soldier advanced up to the woman's face. \"If you don't want to starve you have to do what I say!\"\n\nAnd that's when I barged through the door. Marko swung the crowbar at the soldier's face. Hard. A game this may be, there's no excuse for being a bystander when someone is about to be raped. The woman ran past me out the front doors as the soldier recoiled from the force of the swing. He clumsily aimed his rifle in Marko's direction, but I wouldn't let him pull the trigger. Marko took another swing at the soldier, making him fall over on his back.\n\n\"No! Please! I'm sorry!\"\n\nHe pleaded with me. But I didn't care. Blood rushed to my head as Marko struck again, and again, and again, until the unknown soldier lay motionless on the ground. The supermarket was silent.\n\nAs Marko scavenged the rest of the supermarket, my mind wandered. Was it right to kill that soldier? Should I have spared him? He showed remorse so maybe he wouldn't have to die. Or would he have shot me if I had shown him mercy? The game might have definite results to the scenarios I played in my head, but what if this was real. If there was a real soldier and a real woman, and a real rape, what would I have done then? Would I barge into the room and attack the soldier as I had Marko do mere minutes ago? Would I spare the soldier? Would the soldier spare me?\n\nPlease, if the story I told you interested you in any way, buy this game, experience it for yourself. What would you do?",

These ingredients were illegal in Vale, so the group had to go out and collect them separately. \nThey first went after the dragon egg, lured by the promise of a dragon hoard, but began having second doubts when they reached a tall menacing spire in the middle of a lake, with a large pool of water in between a few land masses below. The party fighter lowered himself down into the hole with his rod of ropes and the dragon spoke to him. The fighter was offered the egg they needed in exchange for something of equal value, but many adventurers had failed to offer adequate recompense for the egg. Panicking, our fighter looked down at his character sheet and said, \"Uh... I have powdered ale.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"Well, there's no quantity written down. I think you just said however much I wanted. So infinite.\"\n*Beat*\n*Roll*\n\"He trades you the egg for the ale.\"\n\nThe second item was succubus milk, so they tracked down some succubi living in the city.\n\"I knock on the door.\"\n\"A tall woman with dark hair and beautiful face answers.\"\n\"Hi, can you spare a few minutes to talk about our lord and saviour, The Marshmallow God?\"\n\"Are you joking?\" *slams door on his foot*\nAfter a few more awkward minutes of conversation, the rogue turns him invisible so they can nope the fuck out of there. The fighter then summons a choker (aberrant sphere) through the window and immediately boots down the door, becoming visible as he does. He runs to the only door in the room and throws it open, discovering two naked women, who scream bloody murder.\nAt this point the town guard has showed up, they killed the choker and, after a horribly failed bluff, try to apprehend the fighter.\n\"I resist\"\n*facepalm* \"Are you sure?\"\n\"Yea, grapple!\" *Roll*\n*roll* \"You fail\"\n\"Okay then... I eat all my dust (embodiment of the basic elements)!\"\n\"You take 13 con damage.\"\n\"I'm dead.\"\n\"But you went super Saiyan for a moment.\"\nAnd that's how the second fighter died.\n\nThey are taken off the quest after that and it's assigned to a different group. Later that week, the party is awoken by the cities alarms sounding. Most of the party rushes to the window to see the massive cake golem rampaging through the streets. A cake golem with a tiny little baker on its shoulder waving a pistol around and laughing. But I say most of the party went to see, because the fighter didn't.\nThe fighter started dancing.\nSee, the fighter had a grog ability where every time he dances, a natural disaster occurred.\nAnd *roll*... 100... It just so happened that the disaster happened in Vale. And *roll*... 20... It's the strongest level windstorm there is. And *roll*... 1... The cake golem failed its fortitude save. The baker is the first thing to be pulled off the golems shoulder and flung into the tornado, and slowly, layer after layer as the golem was trying to get away, it was sucked into the tornado, and perished.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how my group succeeded on a 5 encounter adventure by only completing one encounter.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "**TL;DR** Some people would rather elect a known murderer than a bigot. \n\nThis is your official profanity warning. Also: length=long.\n\nBeginning in middle school, I was involved in playtesting a LARP game a friend's father made called Hallow's Edge. It was a \"steampunk zombie LARP,\" where we could run around and hit each other with foam swords and shoot each other with foam blasters. For a while it was the only exercise I ever got. I kept playing all through high school because I'm an enormous nerd and loved it. \n\nThe lore was pretty intensive, and very obviously a platform for the main creator to indoctrinate a bunch of kids into his thinking. The idea behind it was this: what would happen *after* the technological singularity? When man and machine are basically the same? Basically: bad things. Some dude named Kurze (aka Ray Kurzweil) uploaded a virus that corrupted anyone hooked into the network, which was basically everyone. Shit went bad real fast, and everyone not hooked in went underground into what were called \"Hallows.\" Nanotech became magic and typical engineers became full blown magicians. The folks upstairs became corrupted in a variety of ways, which lead to a variety of different creatures we would have to fight. Around 250 years after the Reckoning (which is what the virus--uploady-thing was called) the High King and President James Oliver decided we should get out the hole we dug for ourselves and began a campaign to reclaim the surface.\n\nLong story short: it went well. Really well. We wiped the floor with those undead fuckeroonis. There were a lot of sketchy characters that showed up along the way. Mysterious groups responsible for a variety of subterfuge, as is their wont. Anti-human terrorist groups (we'll get to that), anti-critter groups, semi-sentient goblins, wastelanders (known as the Clans, they disbanded after about 4 years of being insufferable asshats), I think ninjas showed up at some point. Anyway: we had basically cleared the way for a new human empire based in the Midwestern US (because that's where we were, dammit). One of my characters became King (a story for another time), one was brutally murdered, and another betrayed every who even somewhat trusted him. That's the guy we're talking about today. His name was Silas. He was fucking insane.\n\nSilas came around at a time when I was just really bored. Charles was king, and I wasn't comfortable playing him any more, so I decided to play someone who the epitome of Chaotic Evil. The backstory isn't terribly important, because I never really stuck to it. Supposedly, Silas was one of Kurze's first forays into transhumanist experiments. Technically all the singularity shit was, too, and so was the virus, but Silas was a step above that. Of course, he went insane and escaped the complex to wander the wastes and spread a fair amount of chaos.\n\nHe ends up settling near the town of Springfield, which the heroes had liberated from the critters after an epic battle that ended in the genocide of all the critters in town (My king character, Charles, made that decision). He was immediately disliked and feared, because he was also very clearly insane. However, as time passed, he learned to hide or otherwise focus it into an uncommon ability to fuck people's plans up. He was really really good at that. Towards the end of one of the last seasons/story arcs (it was the Midwest, where the weather actually changes and we didn't want to play outside in the cold) the mayor was brutally murdered and couldn't be resurrected because reasons. Soon, elections were to be held. There were two contenders of note: our \"hero,\" Silas, and some woman whose last name was Winters.\n\nOur Storymaster is a big fan of bringing complex social issues or dilemmas into the game. The story line that made Charles king involved a Coventry-style Catch-22. This time around we were debating whether or not the humans in the group were to be the only ones represented. The Goblins, who were only somewhat sentient, had been a great help in our struggle against the darker forces in the world. They provided the main body of our army (there were thousands of them and around 100 \"heroes,\" in universe, at least; we never had more than 20 people come to the games) and were seen as another check against some of what remained of the undead in the region.\n\nAnyway, Winters's argument was that a) I'm a criminal and not fit to lead, and b) the Goblins should not be considered people. Rather, they should be used as tools or weapons against our enemies, but never considered equal or given the same rights normal citizens had. Silas advocated equal treatment for critters that can demonstrate human-level critical thinking skills and claimed to be reformed/remorseful about his prior acts against the town. So we voted. It was close. Really, really close. I honestly don't know what would have happened if the election went the other way. Turns out people would rather elect a murderer than a bigot, because Silas definitely won that election. \n\n\"This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.\"\n\nSilas had no real motive in running for mayor. It was kind of spur-of-the-moment type thing. The first thing Silas did as mayor was formerly introduce himself to the other governmental leaders. They were representatives of the other factions (The Kingdoms were the main military body, the Guilds controlled the economy in mob-like fashion, and the Cathedrals was in charge of healing and resurrection) and were quite right in not trusting Silas.\n\nA variety of violently pro-critter groups arrived on the scene, which Silas quickly quelled. And by quelled I mean he consolidated them under one banner and they did what he said. He also got a hold of an unhealthy amount of poison, which he, as villainously necessary, he began to dump in the town's water supply. After an incident involving cows that give strawberry milk and goblins, he had established solid diplomatic inroads with said goblins, leading to them revering him as a hero and leader. This is what we in the villain gang call \"covering your bases.\" Let's say it worked out pretty well.\n\nAnd so begins my last session with the group before I went off to college. As mayor, Silas called \"court,\" or the meeting we have at the beginning of every session to decide what missions we were going to run and to bring up any issues we should discuss. He figured the goblin army in the horizon was as good as any. Silas started court by telling the assembled heroes and civilians that they were complete and total idiots, that they should never have elected him mayor. They gave him the power and privilege he needed to destroy them, and by God he, would if only to spite them. At the conclusion of his villainous monologue, he jumped out the window and GTFO'd, because while devious and certainly a master strategist (at least compared to those fools), he was also a coward. The anti-human terrorists detonated the ordinance they had gathered in the weeks since their last attack. The poison had stretched the Cathedrals' resources, and there was a giant hole in the wall from when the heroes had initially taken Springfield. The goblins poured in through the hole, riding emaciated cows painted pink. You know that scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers where Saruman's Uruk Hai storm Helm's Deep through the hole in the wall? It was kind of like that, except instead of the White Hand of Saruman, it has a crude rendering of Silas's face.\n\nIt was glorious. And complete massascre. The goblins had murdered about 20% of the town's population (roughly 600 people, I think) before the heroes had completed their evacuation. Springfield was Silas's, and needless to say, no-one was exactly happy about.\n\nThe Rape of Springfield, as it has come to be known (at least in my head, I'm dramatic like that), was the heroes most crushing defeat. Their preoccupation with protecting the survivors was their downfall, and the heroes of the Kingdoms, of Humanity were banished. I don't know where they stand now since I haven't really kept up with the group since I left, but our Storymaster provided a fair amount of closure in the form of a character epilogue.\n\nPicture Silas, in all his glory and ill-gotten regalia. He has fashioned himself as a lord, or king over the goblins, who continue to burn and destroy the town around him. The city is in flames. In the distance, bright white lights shoot up from the horizon, arcing slowly towards the taken city. Silas stares in wonderment (and perhaps joy) as the missiles rain down around him, the white phosphorus burning the flesh off his subjects.\n\nHe laughs.",

        "text": "A while back, one of my players came to me and asked if he could try playing a new character for a while without killing his current one. This guy was a veteran, the only member of my nearly two year long campaign who had been with me since the very beginning. That being the case, I decided to Kenny his character (that is, make it appear that he died only to have him show up later) so he could try something new. We joked that it would be funny if his new character was secretly evil. Then we talked about it. Then we decided to do just that.\n\nI figured out a way to tie this in to the plot of the current arc, which was a few sessions shy of concluding. This was my mistake, in hindsight, as the betrayal of a character the party's known for only a handful of sessions was never going to be that shocking. Seemed brilliant at the time though, and the player was on board, so we went ahead and Kennyed his character in the very next session. One of the other PCs died for real attempting to save him, about which I felt bad, so we added him to the conspiracy and had both their new characters be secretly working for the Big Bad behind the events of this particular arc.\n\nWhen it finally came time to reveal the betrayal, everything was executed perfectly; the others were oblivious, getting ready to fight the Big Bad, when each of the two traitors suddenly attacked one of the PCs. The cleric died instantly, and the druid managed to escape death by making a deal with a bargain demon he'd contacted previously to heal him and teleport him to the Feywild. This act of sudden, violent team killing was met with dead silence. Not even the \"Holy shit\" stunned silence, but a complacent silence. Shrugs. No fucks given. I was fucking dejected. Even when I turned around and betrayed the betrayers by having the Kennyed character return as an NPC to fuck them up, their reaction was only one of mild surprise. Was disappointed as shit.\n\nThe traitors were killed, as was the Big Bad, and all was well. But I had one last card ready to play: the character that got away, chilling in the Feywild with a bargain demon. He'd left his possessions behind when he teleported, so he asked the demon if he could have them back. It said certainly, but the druid had to promise it a favor, which it could call in at any time, and which the druid would have to perform or forfeit his soul. Druid agrees, gets all his stuff back. The demon then calls in the favor, asks the druid to do something which would allow the demon to possess him. The druid responds how I expected him to: he goes out with a bang.\n\nHe takes the Wabbajack (the staff which does a bunch of random shit and almost killed them all in one of my previous stories) and snaps it over his knee. I had prepared a contingency beforehand for if this happened and had been hinting at it ever since. They all knew it would be something crazy. None of them expected what actually happened. Each of the 31 possible effects of the Wabbajack fired off simultaneously, with the Mad God treated as the wielder and the target selected by rolling a D6 to determine which Plane of reality it affected, then determining the target of greatest interest to the Mad God on that plane. This did not go nearly as poorly for the players as it could have, and actually buffed two of them quite impressively. Among the more notable effects were:\n\nOrcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, was turned into cheese.\nAsmodeus, lord of the Nine Hells, became a god and ascended to the heavens, creating a massive power vacuum in Hell which set off a war among the devils. Until this war is resolved, no souls can enter the Hells, meaning everyone who dies becomes a ghost haunting their former home.\nA blizzard set upon the entire Feywild and will remain for a whole year, killing nearly all the plant life and magical beings living there.\nA meteor shower set upon all layers of the Abyss and will also remain for a year, killing all demons who could not teleport to another plane and forcing those who could to flee to other planes of existence. Many have chosen the Material Plane, essentially amounting to a demon invasion of the planet.\nThe God of Order was killed and replaced by a duplicate version of himself, with all of his power yet without a body, who serves the Mad God.\nThere are now two, identical versions of the Mad God, one of whom is imprisoned. The other, occupying the body of the former lord of Dis, the second level of the Nine Hells, is trying to free his imprisoned self.\n\nAll in all, I can't complain about this outcome, and if nothing else it has taught me that I need to play the long con.",

        "text": "My apologies for the duality of the title. We're playing fifth edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\n\n**THE SETUP:**\n\nI'm running a group of 4-5 people through **The Rise of Tiamat** after finishing\nthe **Hoard of the Dragon Queen**. They have done without *any* healing magic\nfor the last part of Hoard and first part of Rise. No Druid, Paladin, or Cleric.\n  Party makeup consists of two Rangers, a Barbarian, and a Wizard. Our newest\n  addition is a Rogue. The two Rangers do have Cure Wounds prepared, but they tend to forget they have it, or use up their spell slots prior to a healing spell becoming a necessity. \n\nThis was the crux of my problem: Rise of Tiamat is a *dangerous* adventure. How do I give my players a bit of a boost so they don't need two long rests and a sandwich after every fight?\n  \nWell, give them an NPC who can heal, of course! But that's a tricky business, running an NPC for the party. I didn't want the NPC to overshadow any party\nmembers, nor did I want it to be difficult to keep track of, and I didn't want a\nmoment of, \"Huh, our NPC bard/cleric hasn't done anything in a while,\" or \"Where\ndid so-and-so go?\"\n\nAfter some heavy drinking and a few lines of cocaine, revelation came to me.\n\nFlynn, the Halfling Bard. \n\nFlynn's previous party was dismembered by Bone Devils. Flynn escaped with a bump on the head and lost both of his legs at the knee. He suffers from narcolepsy, a deep-rooted fear of Bone Devils, and an insufferably cheery disposition. \n\nWhenever I, the DM, speak as Flynn, I use a ridiculously high voice, and Flynn always has something nice or positive to say to another member of the Party. \n\nI introduced him at the beginning of a session. I expected a Halfling who couldn't walk *might* be a hard sell, and I had prepared a list of reasons why he might benefit the Party. I had planned to lead with his weight i.e. he could be easily carried in a backpack. But none of the reasons/excuses I had prepared were necessary, as a player beat me to the punch. \n\n---\n\nEnter Heavy, the Barbarian. Heavy's player plays him as a big, dumb, and strong Barbarian with a heavy austrian accent. \n\nUpon Flynn being wheeled into the room where the party was being briefed, Heavy leapt into action. \n\n\"I want to put him in my backpack. Heavy reaches over and puts Flynn in his\nbackpack.\"\n\n**Flynn:** \"Oh my goodness, we're going for a ride!\"\n\nHeavy then smashed the wheelchair and said: \"Augh, you can ride with me! \n\nMoments after Heavy dumped him into his backpack, Flynn fell asleep. \n\n**Heavy:** \"Augh, it's okay, sleep. No one bug him, he's got no feet!\"\n\nI then explained (through another NPC) that an encounter with a Bone Devil left Flynn without legs and a mild case of narcolepsy.\n\n---\n\nThe Party now had an NPC who could provide healing and buffs. He doesn't overshadow other party members, he's easy to keep track of, and I've role-played him well-enough that they genuinely accept him as a member of the group. Success!\n\n**THE PAYOFF:**\n\nBecause Flynn suffers from narcolepsy, he spends much of his time asleep in Heavy's backpack. And because Heavy has gone full Bear Totem, he doesn't notice the extra weight. \n\nFlynn has spent about a tenday in Heavy's backpack. He hasn't left it *once*. Not to use the bathroom, not to change his clothes, nothing. I have mentioned this to Heavy several times, who always checks the backpack to see if Flynn has soiled it. Every time this happens, I tell him its clean, and there is no sign of Halfing poo. \n\n(There is a reason for this, but I'm waiting for my players to discover it for themselves.)\n\nUpon returning from the Sea of Moving Ice, where Heavy grappled an **Adult White Dragon** while under the effects of an *Enlarge* spell, he felt pleased with himself. So this is what his player told me:\n\n\"Heavy wants to Fight, Drink, and Fornicate, in that order.\"\n\nI told him that Heavy was able to find a bar with a lot of big sweaty men that had fighting *and* alcohol. He was pleased with this, I had him roll an Athletics check, he rolled high. So he won his fights. Then I had him roll a Constitution save (DC 15). He rolled a 14. \n\n\"You have a little bit too much to drink, and you wake up a few hours later in a bed above the bar, with another sweaty muscely man next to you.\"\n\nThis generated a slow-clap from the player to my immediate right. \n\nI told him that he never specified what gender he wanted to fornicate with, and he *did*\nhave a little bit too much to drink. \n\nHeavy walked out of the room and began talking to his sentient, neutral evil\ngreatsword, **Hazirawn**, whom I RP in a sultry, seductive, female voice.\n\n**Heavy:** What did you do?!\n\n**Hazi:** What did *I* do? What did you do?\n\n**Heavy:** You tell me to do things!\n\n**Hazy:** I didn't tell you to do that sugar, but I sure did like to *watch*.\n\n**Heavy:** What do you want from me?!\n\n**Hazi:** I want you to fill me up. With blood.\n\n**Heavy:** Okay. Like who?\n\n**Hazi:** Like that guy who just buggered you, *kill him for me*.\n\nHeavy's player then volunteered a Wisdom saving throw, he rolled a 7. \n\nHeavy then marched back into the room and slaughtered his gay lover with Hazirawn. \n\n**Heavy:** What now? \n\n**Hazi:** I'm good for now, he was *dddeeelliiicccciiouuuss*.\n\n**ME[the DM]:** You hear a high-pitched voice coming from your backpack: \"*Yyyyaawwwwnnn*,\nwhat's going on-\"\n\n**Heavy:** Go back to sleep! Go back to sleep!\n\n**Flynn:** Why?\n\nHeavy walks over and picks up the backpack, holding it against the wall.\n\n**Flynn:** Mumble, mumble, mumble! Heavy, what's going on out there? \n\n**Heavy:** Nothing, it's fine, go back to sleep!\n\n**Flynn:** Are you sure, do you want my help?\n\n**Heavy:** NO!\n\n**Flynn:** You were drinking a lot last night-\n\n**Heavy:** I know! Go to sleep.\n\nHeavy closes the backpack.\n\n**Flynn:** Okay.\n\n**Heavy:** If you don't, I'm going to juggle you in the air!\n\n**Flynn:** I'm going to sleep!\n\nA party member of dubious morality then arrived and helped Heavy dispose of the body, by throwing it out the window.\n\n**Heavy:** [addressing the new addition] What to do about the bed, you do magic, right?\n\n**Flynn:** [from the closed backpack] I do magic!\n\n**Heavy:** NO! Go back to sleep!\n\n**Flynn:** I'm asleep!\n\nA cover story was then devised. Heavy walks over to the backpack and addresses Flynn again:\n\n**Heavy:** We're leaving.\n\n**Flynn:** Okay!\n\n**Heavy:** Do you want anything to eat or drink before we go? [they *are* in a bar]\n\n**Flynn:** No, I'm asleep!\n\n**Heavy:** Okay.\n\nAfter this incident Heavy has developed a crisis of conscience, because the\nsword keeps telling him to do bad things. Most of the time he is able to resist\nthe sword, but this was a messy exception. \n\nIn future sessions I'm going to try and balance the evil influence that Hazirawn\nhas over Heavy with the innocent gooey goodness that is Flynn. \n\nHe has an Angel on his shoulders, and a Devil in his hands.\n",

She (our new rogue) hadn't played any iteration of D&amp;D before, but took to it like a duck to water. Zombie cows were ridden and then bludgeoned to death, traps were mostly detected-everything was ace.\n\nNow, as I couldn't assume that our new player would be available regularly I decided to run a one-off module that evening, and I settled on The Vile Darkness of VonGlauss Mansion (it's available on EN World and absolutely worth your time). I also wanted the adventure to happen within the world the group had already created, but about five years in the past-before they met up with the absent meatshield. But to give you an idea of the group dynamic, I need to explain a bit about the players and the characters.\n\nRonnie the Bear (wizard) - If you left Robin Williams alone in a library for twenty-seven years, this guy is what would walk out. A linguistics major with a brain packed so tight his mouth runs like a faucet. He'll bounce between several languages (dead and alive), quote an episode of Moonlighting, slap on a pun and an observation about Asian poetry in the space it takes him to cast Shield. This is the actual guy, by the way, not the character. He's schizophrenia in a can. He plays an earnest wizard, fair and kind, utterly consumed with the desire for knowledge. He has no idea that the rogues only travel with him because of a powerful artifact he carries. As far as he knows, it's an ordinary object.\n\nGriffo - As TN as it gets. He's been tasked by his branch of the Thieves' Guild to steal the artifact Ronnie has on his possession.\n\nLady - As NG as it gets. She's been tasked by her branch of the Thieves' Guild to see that the artifact remains in Ronnie's possession.\n\nFair warning-the story will contain spoilers for the module, so... read on accordingly.\n\nMost of the module goes as planned. Ronnie teaches a harpsichord mimic to play chopsticks and Griffo locks it in a room. Griffo falls into a pit trap and Lady palms a +1 dagger she finds. Griffo and Lady spend the entire time stealing the artifact either from Ronnie or back and forth among each other. Their proficiency with Sleight of Hand keeps Ronnie from detecting any of this. Ronnie feels guilty about locking the mimic in a room. Ronnie feels left out because Lady and Griffo keep passing notes to me and he has no idea they've stolen his doohickey.\n\nThey've already killed the vampire Victor VonGlauss, but the spirits of his wife, young daughter, and maid remain in the house. Having died under mysterious circumstances, the fate of the VonGlauss family and the circumstances that led to Victor's undeadedness are the crux of the module. As the characters meet each deceased family member in their ascent to the attic of the house, it becomes increasingly apparent that Victor used his daughter, his maid, and various dinner guests as hoodooey sacrifices to obtain his immortality, which wasn't worth much anyway and now he's superdead.\n\nGriffo, having learned his lesson, has tucked the artifact inside his armor so every time Lady tries to pickpocket him, she comes up emptyhanded. Lady's getting nervous because I keep handing her notes back with a shrug, Ronnie's nervous because notes keep being passed, and Griffo is giggling like a schoolboy. They barely survive to the second to last room where they encounter two elementals that none of them can reliably harm. Ronnie is knocked out with one punch, Griffo and Lady drag him into the next, and final, room. There're two chests in the room, one normal and one large, and only one door that leads back to the elementals. They're stuck.\n\nWhile Griffo is busy putting the heal on Ronnie, Lady comes up behind him and one-shot KOs him. She strips him, takes the book and hands it to Ronnie, who thought it was in his bag the entire time. Griffo wakes up and starts arguing morality with Lady, all the while trapped by the elementals with Ronnie looking on like a neglected child. To make matters worse, the large chest in the corner pops open and out roll the rotting corpses of Victor VonGlauss' victims; men, women, the maid, and the little baby daughter corpse.\n\nRonnie is freaked the fuck out.\n\nRonnie decides he's going to get the party out of here by blasting a hole in the roof with a firebolt, but succeeds only in lighting the entire ceiling on fire. Griffo and Lady stop arguing and start trying to figure out how to escape the burning attic while Ronnie is calmly apologizing for setting magical fire to a dozen corpses and the roof. Griffo reaches for the first thing at hand and, before Lady can stop him, hurls the decaying baby corpse at the weakened timbers of the ceiling, rolls a crit, smashes the baby corpse through the roof just as Ronnie casts a Thunderwave, shattering the rest of the wood and sending a score of burning, thunderfied body parts flying everywhere.\n\nAnd as they walked away from the mansion, the distant sound of a doomed mimic playing chopsticks on itself carried into the night.\n\n(Lady didn't make a second appearance.)",

        "text": "This is an interlude session when only a couple of us were able to play. This is Lucian's “introduction” to the party, so he is being handled as a NPC (which is why he doesn't do much—Reignless is the main character of the session). Reignless is a half-elf wizard who worships Vecna and recently acquired an artifact, the Sword of Kas. He successfully managed to hide the true nature of the Sword from the rest of the party. Lucian is a half-elf ranger. Unlike Reignless, he's a pretty decent sort, but has some nasty tricks up his sleeve. Both are mid levels—I don't remember exactly, but around 12th. This little adventure is taking place in the countryside of a war-torn kingdom where Deities are beginning to show their hands. ^(he he. Pun intended)\n\nReignless finds himself walking out on a path, some distance from the city with the vague realization that, just perhaps, that Sword was able to mess with his head after all. He didn't remember leaving the city, or why he left. Now it's mid afternoon and he's been walking most of the day.\n \nAs he's walking along, someone rides up behind him, a half-elf ranger named Lucian. Lucian questions him about what he's doing out here on this fairly unused path, but the conversation doesn't go far before some arrows are shot at them from the trees to one side.\n \nThe arrows are being shot by the same bandits that Lucian has been tracking. A few hit Reignless but just bounce off of him (protected by an ioun stone). Lucian rides down the path, both to get away from Reignless (who he suspects is in league with the bandits) and to get out of the ambush. He takes 4 arrows and is badly wounded, but far from dead.\n \nReignless looks for the source of the arrows and manages to see one of the archers; he shoots him with a magic missile. Then he envelops himself with his cloak of Improved Elvenkind and draws the Sword of Kas to do battle. And is promptly taken over by the sword. Again.\n \nHe runs into the trees to slaughter the poor bastards. He casts a sleep spell on several of them and is cutting up the collapsed bodies while the other two try to figure out what is happening. (He is pretty much unnoticeable except for his ioun stones, which aren't all that easy to see.)\n \nLucian is riding along and takes a few more arrows before Reignless uses the sleep spell. He can hear the commotion behind him as the two bandits not felled are yelling for help. And he can see help coming, at least 10 well armed bandits on horseback and another 20 on foot a bit further behind. They're at an angle to him, in the trees, and pretty much leave him alone in their rush to help their men. He can see that two on horseback don't have weapons, probably mages or clerics. After a moment, he turns his horse to head back to the city.\n \nReignless is in a blood frenzy, driven by the sword, and is cutting up the sleeping bodies. He barely notices the arrival of help and is contemptuous of it anyway since his ioun stone protects him from anything but magical weapons and spells. A few more arrows fly around, one hitting him, but it bounces off. He goes to attack another fallen bandit when the air starts burning.\n \nLucian rides past where the fight is taking place, but can't see much. The ten riders get close to the fight and after a few moments of yelling back and forth, one of the riders casts a fireball into the battle area. They figure that with this crazy, invisible bastard killing their men there's nothing to lose with the fireball and they might kill the crazy.\n \nIt works. Reignless falls, well done and extra crispy. When his head hits the ground his ioun stones scatter into the burning brush.\n \nLucian keeps riding for a few more minutes, but grows concerned as the sounds of fighting, return... then grow louder. Suddenly there's a horrible feeling that passes through him. After waiting a minute, he starts to ride back. He can still hear fighting, mostly sword-play, and death screams... but from the sound of it, the fight is moving away.\n \nWhen he arrives at the area, he sees everything for dozens of feet is withered, blasted, and very very dead. Including all the horses from before. Several people are dead as well, but they look to have been cut apart. The scene of carnage continues off into the woods, something caused a deadly fight to develop. But it wasn't Reignless, he sees him right there.\n \nLucian barely reaches Reignless in time and his cure light wounds spell barely drags Reignless back to the living. Reignless then uses a magical item (keogton's ointment) to heal himself the rest of the way. After a quick look around, seeing it is safe, Reignless convinces Lucian to help him find his ioun stones.\n \nReignless recognizes what happened, the sword of Kas had cast Blight and killed any non-evil creature in the area. He doesn't explain to the ranger that the sword was probably trying to protect him where he was laying at the mercy of the bandits.\n \nHe and Lucian search for the ioun stones... and it takes them just over four hours. It is evening by the time they finish. In his hurry to get the ioun stones running again, Reignless carelessly throws the Black Pentacle above his head... the one stone that he has no idea the purpose of and it may well be cursed.\n \nWhile before, Lucian was suspicious and a bit put off by Reignless, he feels he's more willing to give the guy a chance. But it takes him a while to realize that there's a difference in attitude there. (Lucian is not very smart, or wise, or charismatic.)\n \nIn a bit of a bad mood, the two take Lucian's horse and follow the tracks the bandits left behind. After an hour or so, Lucian loses the trail. Desperate to get that sword back, Reignless tries using the ioun stone that sends him to the astral plane. Once there, he realizes that he can't see the material plain (it's the Etherial plain that does that). Even more desperate now he tries to contact his deity, Vecna for advice.\n \nAmazingly enough, he actually manages to get Vecna's attention. But Vecna isn't that impressed with his performance so far, and more than a bit miffed that a lowly acolyte bothered him. So Reignless receives knowledge that there is a clue to the location of the sword, as well as a curse on himself.\n \nIn the prime material, Lucian is looking around wondering where Reignless went when there's a vivid burst of lighting that streaks through the sky. He notices the direction it went and suddenly Reignless re-appears, desperate to know if 'anything just happened'.\n \nThe two ride off in the direction of the lighting, occasionally finding a clue that they're on the right track. It grows dark and Reignless casts a light spell and they continue (while both are half-elves, the horse needs light). They see an occasional body. They see where the lightning struck (turning a tree into a stump that is hand-shaped). They find more bodies.\n \nThe clouds gather in the sky above them, blotting out the stars. It grows darker and darker as the clouds thicken. Eventually, they see the glow of fires and can hear a commotion in the distance. They figure they're close to the bandit camp. The glow off the low clouds shows them the direction and they leave the horse and continue on without the light spell.\n \nReignless suddenly decides to stop as he remembers one of the abilities of the sword is to call lighting... and those clouds feel like storm clouds. As they wait they realize they can hear other people moving in the darkness... to their left is either a large group moving very quietly or a small group being noisy. After waiting a bit, they follow this new group to the bandit's camp.\n \nWhen they arrive near the camp, they see the new group, several dozen people, silhouetted against the camp. The camp itself is in bad shape, several tents have been burnt and there's a lot of mutilated bloody bodies. Men, women and children have been horribly mutilated and tortured to death.\n \nWhen two of the new group sneak into the camp, Reignless gets a good enough look to realize that this new party is a small band of desert nomads... the same people that are invading the country (which is, actually, his fault, but that's another story). The scouts return and the nomads split up to circle the camp.\n \nReignless sneaks into the camp as well, Lucian staying behind. When Reignless gets far enough in, he spots the surviving bandits... as well as the sword in the hand of their leader. Rather than the tough badass he expected, the person with the sword is a young-looking, almost sickly, girl... mid teens at the oldest. But she has the sword, and there's just something about her that is nasty and evil, even to his senses.\n \nAbout the girl is arrayed about thirty bandits, mostly women and children, with ten or so pretty tough and nasty men. All of them have blood splattered on them and the things they are doing with a few sacrifices are rather horrific. Reignless also spots two more of the pale, sickly girls in the crowd. Some sort of ritual is taking place.\n \nHe risks using the ioun stone with the ESP spell to scan for thoughts. The leader-girl is so nasty mentally that he shies away from her after a little bit, gathering the distinct impression that she is a powerful, evil entity even without the sword. From the bandits, he learns that these three girls just arrived and took over the place, starting fights and creating confusion. Eventually the girl killed the bandit leader and took the sword from him. Now they are summoning their demon god and the surviving bandits will be rewarded greatly for their help.\n \nJust then, a storm of arrows arrives as the nomads launch an ambush. A couple fireballs blossom in the middle of the group, and a forked-lighting spell wipes out most of the bandits to one side. The three girls don't seem overly affected, though the leader stumbles to one side, waving the sheathed sword about. She was using the bandit leader's body as an impromptu soapbox and fell off when the fireballs exploded.\n \nReignless hurriedly casts a Sure Strike spell on a blessed stake and charges at the leader girl, hoping she doesn't notice him in the confusion and he gets the chance to stake her.\n \nThe confusion is plenty, arrows continue to fly in even as the two pale girl's hurl their own spells into the trees. One casts a 4-set magic missile spell... and a few moments later follows it up with /another/ spell, much quicker than she should have been able to. The other launches her own fireball.\n \nReignless makes it through to the pale leader, but before he can attack her she steadies herself then casts her own spell... luckily it isn't at him, she throws an arc of darkness towards the trees to one side. He leaps at her and, his hand guided by the sure-strike, rams the stake right into her heart!\n \nOnly to discover she isn't a vampire! She twists around in surprise, a growl coming from her mouth, even as black blood fountains from her mouth. Blood splashes out from the wound as well, and where it touches his hand it burns. Reignless dives for the sword, managing to wrestle it out of the girl's grasp, mostly by his body weight and pure surprise, then activates his astral ioun stone and vanishes!\n \nOut in the trees, Lucian hears a new fight starting up. He sees the flashes of spells and hears the sudden yells of wounded. He waits for a while, but Reignless doesn't return. He turns back to get his horse and head to the city.\n \nReignless tries to emerge from the Astral Plane back to the Material about where they left the horse, but misses by quite a bit. He is far enough away that there's no sound or light from the battle and the clouds overhead look normal. After a bit of stumbling around, he gets enough of a break in the cloud cover to figure out what direction is which and heads in the direction he hopes the city is.\n\nHe has plenty of time to reflect on events from the afternoon and evening and realizes that the sword wasn't trying to protect him with Blight, but that someone else was using it at the time. In fact, the Sword was probably taking him to the weird witch girls when he finally woke. Which ticks him off more than a little bit. He also starts wondering what the curse he received is as well.\n \nLucian is riding towards the city when he realizes he knows where Reignless is... he leaves the path and rides a mile through the woods to meet the other man, greeting him easily out of the darkness. At the moment Reignless is too tired to realize that Lucian wasn't surprised to see him so doesn't make the connection.\n\nVecna's curse: Anyone that knows Reignless' name knows where to find him.\n",

        "text": "Not my story. This is a recent comment from over at /r/gaming. It was a response to the original post, which was a meme image: REST OF TEAM IS DEAD / FEEL THEM JUDGE YOUR EVERY MOVE. For those not familiar with Counterstrike, a match is a series of short rounds. The terrorists have a choice to plant a bomb at A or B, while the counter-terrorists attempt to either kill them all or defuse the bomb. If you die, you spend the rest of that round watching through the eyes of your surviving teammate(s).\n\n____\n\nStory/action by /u/SuperCub (on map Dust2)    \nOriginal post: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2yk5bd/counterstrike_players_will_know_this_feeling/cpaa38n\n\nI remember it so well… It was one of the very last rounds of CS:Source that I ever played. I was a Terrorist and my whole team was dead. Someone dropped the bomb at B and I knew all 5 Counter-Terrorists were guarding it. Nothing I could do but head for the bomb, so I snuck out the double doors, picked up a silenced pistol, and somehow nailed the dude in the upper right sniper position.\n\n4 left.\n\nI knew that had alerted them, so I circled back into the tunnel. I tossed a flash bang out towards B and immediately wheeled around to the double doors. As luck would have it, one of their idiots had followed me down to the double doors and just happened to come in right as I was coming out. Boom, knifed a bitch.\n\n3 left.\n\nWithout missing a step, I ran hard up to B from CT spawn. I knew they would be distracted by my flash bang, but hoped I still had a window before they turned their attention back to the main entrance. A quick peek inside revealed two CTs guarding the bomb. No idea where the third is.\n\nLike Peyton Manning, I put up a frag grenade over B and quickly hopped up into the sniper perch above the boxes. The frag exploded, and just like I'd hoped, 1 CT freaked out enough to move from his cover. Boom, headshot.\n\n2 left.\n\n*Oh my god I might actually do this.*\n\nWhipped out my AK-47 and popped a few rounds into where I thought the other CT was hiding. Jumped down from the perch and circled back to the door. Peeked in again. Nobody. But there's the bomb.\n\nI know he's watching the bomb, but fuck it I'm going for it. So I ran out from cover and grabbed it, fully expecting shots to nail me at any second. But nothing happened. Crouching behind a box at B, I looked around. Holy fuck, there he is! Dude is sitting behind a box staring down the tunnel. Boom, headshot. He never even saw me.\n\n1 left.\n\nFuck, I'm not planting at B, that's where the last dude will expect. So I head back out the double doors, running and jumping like an asshole, and head straight through CT spawn over to A.\n\nComing up the ramp, there's nobody. Its a ghost town. I can feel my teammates watching my every move, hoping I'm lucky enough to pull this off. I'm about to hit the corner and turn to plant on the bomb site, but boom… damage… The shots came from behind me. Dude is still over near B but hauling ass towards A. It's a race now.\n\nI grab some cover and plant the bomb on A as quickly as possible. I know he's coming up the ramp, but I get the plant and quickly hop over the wall. I hear his M4A1 firing but nothing hits me. I'm back on the ramp, down near CT spawn, and I know the last dude has a choice: The bomb, or me.\n\nHe chooses the bomb, and I hear the diffuse starting. What. An. Idiot. So I retrace my steps, come around the corner, pull out my knife, and bury it in the back of his skull.\n\nBoom, baby.\n\nWhen I could hear my teammates again, all I heard was a resounding chorus of \"DUUUUUUDE\" and \"HOLY SHIT HE DID IT!\" I think that was the best game of CS that I ever played.\n\nedit: Yes, this was on Dust2. Thanks for the Gold mystery benefactor!\n\nedit2: Wow, thank you for all the replies, I upvoted everyone who hit my inbox. It's awesome to hear how many of you had a similar experience. Some of you even sent me videos of your clutch moments and they were really fun to watch! I havnt played CS:S since about 2006 but I'd love to get back into it.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zo7jz/pathfinder_the_absolute_best_samurai_campaign/",
        "text": "Have you ever played a campaign where everyone in the group plays characters of the Samurai class? If not, you might want to after reading this, as the shenanigans you can pull are *hilarious* if you do it similarly to how we did.\n\nWe finished up our last campaign, hosted by yours truly, and then rotated GM's. Our next GM, coincidentally my brother, gave us the choice of doing a zombie campaign, or an Everyone is A Samurai campaign. The group chose Everyone is A Samurai, giving the justification that they'd be doing more fighting if everyone was of the same class. That comes up again later.\n\nSo, after some deliberation over what time period the campaign would take place in, we settled on the Sengoku Jidai era of Japanese History, going into the end of said era. We picked this era for two reasons – we wanted to have guns, and Oda Nobunaga is a badass. Having picked out our setting and time period, we then sped on to character creation.\n\nOur party ended up being a very oddball crew after character creation, with one being completely normal, some being slightly normal, some being a little odd, and some being completely out of left field. As a gag, some of the characters were named after car manufacturers. Keep in mind that, while the campaign takes place in the Sengoku Jidai, the GM did include some fantasy elements, including some... *interesting* mounts. Let's start with the normal character.\n\nOur normal character in all this is Lee Nakashima. Lee was one of the two Samurai in our initial party that was of the Ronin order. He had been kidnapped from home at an early age, and his wife was recently killed. He was also rather skeptical of the existence of spirits, which our campaign featured rather heavily in the form of *mushi*. Lee chose a regular old horse as his mount, and it was the only horse in the party.\n\nNext, is the peasant-turned-samurai Yamaha. While I say he turned-samurai, he more or less *adopted a samurai identity*. i.e. He killed a samurai and took his name. Yamaha aimed to prove himself as the greatest samurai in the world, and this somehow took him to Oda as a hired gun. He had a *horse-sized elephant* as his mount. BTW, our GM limited us to horse-sized animals.\n\nNext up, we have Bubba Suzuki – the samurai-chef. He served under Oda Nobunaga as a cook, and apparently makes some of the best damn fried chicken in the land. He uses a unique *tri-wield technique* with his katanas, which took a little GM finagling to balance. He *also* has a horse-sized elephant as a mount.\n\nAnd finally, we have probably the only other normal character in this motley crew; the lady-samurai Rayet Areash. Rayet used to be a samurai for her clan, until Koreans attacked and killed everyone she ever loved, after which they burned the place down to the ground. From that point onwards, she swore to never be a friend to a Korean again, and became a Ronin. There is, however, an interesting other side to her, which is revealed later on in the story. She has a Dire Fox as her mount, which has served her well and isn't as outlandish as some of the other mounts.\n\nThese, of course, are only the regulars in our session; there were some other *outlandish* characters that were made by players who haven't played with us for some time. The best example is a samurai with a **giant centipede** as his mount!!!\n\nSo, the stage having been set, we set out on a glorious adventure! To be continued!",

        "text": "I just finished a Pathfinder session with my group as my level 1 Half-Orc Bard, Korgul the Bastard. \n\nNow, Korgul isn't your typical Half-Orc in the sense that he's more about personal fame, filling his pockets with gold and spending time with pretty ladies than honourable combat and being your generic Half-Orc barbarian.\n\nTonight, for lack of a better term, was Korgul's fucking night.\n\nNow to start things off, Korgul and his Bodyguard/Good friend, Briar Bonebark (a Treeman Barbarian known to make people explode in combat) are off on a shopping trip to get Briar some sweet new clothes. After purchasing a straw hat, some fireproof boots and a pair of sunglasses, we leave the store to attend to Korgul's shopping, which involves buying a pair of Cestuses (Cesti?) and a bayonet for his crossbow. \n\nUpon entering the smithy, Korgul approaches the gentleman behind the counter and gets to talking about weapons. After a bit of talk, Korgul decides that he's gonna get himself a discount. Seeing as we're in a small town, the blacksmith says \"Tell you what Bard, for every person you bring into my shop, I'll knock five silvers off of your total purchase\" Seeing as his purchase totals out to around fifteen GP, Korgul accepts and begins wandering the town, singing a catchy tune about the wonders of the blacksmith's shop (Performance, sing: 26 with a situational bonus of +2 because the song I improvised was apparently pretty catchy by the DM's standards). After asking three members of his party to swing by the store and poke around for a few minutes, Korgul returns to the beaming store owner who forks over five gold pieces and says \"You said you'd bring people to my store and you didn't fail to please, you kept your word, so I shall keep mine\" before handing over the Cesti (Cestuses?) and bayonet. \n\nAfter that, Briar, crazy treeman barbarian that he is, decides that he wants to get some free drinks at the bar and we both decide that the best way to do so is to put on a damn good show for those inside the bar. \n\nAfter picking out the two meanest and ugliest people in there (a Half-Orc Warrior and a Gnome Barbarian, more on the Gnome in a bit), Korgul kicks the door in and recites a speech to the onlooking audience with an amazing roll of 25 for singing and 17 for diplomacy, he has the entire bar except for those two on his side as he bellows:\n\n\"THAT'S RIGHT! YOU SEE IT'S ME, IT'S ME, IT'S THAT B-A-S-T-A-R-D, WITH HIS GOOD FRIEND THE T-R-DOUBLE-E!\"\n\nBefore pausing for dramatic effect and reciting:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, elves and dwarves, people of all races...Kord and Gruumsh proudly brings to you, the one and only, TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS OF THE WOOOOORLD! The Bastard Bard, Korgul! The Tree Man, Briar Bonebark! The NEW...AGE...OUTLAWS!\"\n\n(Korgul was inspired mildly by none other than the Road Dogg Jesse James, I'm sure you wrasslin' fans may have noticed by now)\n\nWith that out of the way, Korgul approaches the Gnome barbarian and winds up a haymaker aimed at her head.\n\nCRIT!\n\nUnfortunately he rolled a 1 and the double damage amounted to a light tap on the head. \n\nAttempting to cover up his botched attempt at a knockout punch, Korgul merely states \"My bad, I was under the impression that I was attacking a child for a moment there.\"\n\nThe GM lets me know that the Barbarian is now visibly raging.\n\nMeanwhile, Briar has managed to knock out the Half-Orc with one blow and is now coming over to assist me.\n\nThe Barbarian takes a massive swing at Korgul with her bastard sword (fitting, considering her target) and manages to only glance off of his armour as he sidesteps the attack.\n\nBriar chimes in by saying \"That sword is a bit large for you, isn't it wee one?\"\n\nGM says that the Barbarian would rage some more, but she is unable to do so.\n\nThe entire group has a hearty laugh about this.\n\nMeanwhile, our team pacifist tiefling Cleric is doing her best to stabilize the knocked out Half-Orc, because that's how she rolls.\n\nBriar lands a hit on the Barbarian now, knocking her down 13 Hitpoints.\n\nKorgul winds up for another punch and manages to miss this time, afterwards stating \"Damn my conscience! I just can't bring myself to harm a child!\"\n\nInstead of going after the massive treeman, the Barbarian continues to attack me, finally landing a blow and knocking me down three HP.\n\nBriar, being the wonderful giant tree man that he is, manages to kick the Barbarian across the room after this, knocking her into next week. \n\nUpon defeating our opponents, Korgul bows to the audience and attempts to raise Briar's arm into the air and failing due to how freaking big Briar is. So Briar ends up lifting his arm himself, and Korgul with him. \n\nNaturally the entire bar ERUPTS with applause after this show we've put on for them, showering us with trinkets and small coin.\n\nAfter doing a few mental calculations, Korgul realizes that he's managed to earn enough coin to afford himself the one thing he's been saving up for most of his life. \n\nBidding those around him adieu, Korgul rushes out of the building and down to the nearest Carriage dealer.\n\nUpon his arrival, Korgul finds that news travels fast and that the Carriage dealer's son had witnessed the whole fight and told his pa all about it. Seeing a potential business endeavour in front of him, Urst the Carriage dealer decides to cut our Bastard Bard a deal, seeing as the first thing he did after his massive show was rush right to him and will no doubt drum up a lot of business. For the low, low price of 120 GP, Korgul earns himself a fancy carriage and two fine horses to pull it for him. \n\nAnd to think, I was considering not taking part in tonight's session.",

        "text": "So In our group (half-elf bard, human rogue, halfling barbarian, dragonborn Fighter, shardmind battlemind). \nThe Barbarian was leaving and was being replaced by a new member who  joined our party who was a dumb, but tough as hell, cleric.  there was a long standing rivalry and distrust between the Halfling barbarian and my half-elf bard. It mainly stemmed from when my Bard had forgot how to sing when my sisters char (who later split the party in half) punched him in the face (and rolled a 'nat 20) and gave him temporary amnesia.  After my sister had split the party it was my bard, the halfling barbarian, and the more-or-less evil rogue in a near by town. The dimwitted barbarian tried tribal medicine on the bard and punched him again so he would remember.  He knocked out and injured the bard. He then dragged my bard to the near by church to be healed. There the cleric asked what happened to my bard and the barbarian failed the bluff check. The barbarian got arrested and my char and the rogue wanted to try and get him out as they didn't really have the time for a trial. Alas we couldn't find a way to get him out so we waited, but the barbarian at that point really began to distrust the bard.\n During the time waiting for the trial my bard used his new found fame as the bard-bludgeoned to get services and stuff in return for promising to bring more people to the location. The trial went through and the barbarian, at that point known as the bard bludgeon-er, was tasked to clear out a near by orc camp. he did that but on his way out yelled at my bard and criticized him (we are friends irl, just role playing). This really made the bard mad. later as the group leaved town we were caught by one of the people who my  bard has promised to go to and get more people to go to and to bring the barbarian with him (basically have the bard and barbarian sign auto graphs). This really pissed off the barbarian, who after talking to the man and getting him to go away. slapped the bard. \nThe group then went to clear out and retrieve a head of an orc as proof, which they did. On the way back to town the barbarian fell in a pit trap that was made by the orcs, injuring himself. one orc happened to be down there and fought with the now fairly injured barbarian. The rest of the group ran off to get help and find a  latter. My bard stayed behind to help the barbarian. The barbarian finished off the orc and when he went to climb out. asked for a hand from the bard, still trusting him some what since they where close to town.  As the barbarian stick out his hand, My bard picks him up. He then lifts him above the edge and tells him,\"You injured me and betrayed me. I bet you tried to take me out instead of \"helping\" me. Consider this revenge\". at the end of that sentence My bard drops him back down into the pit where he gets impaled on a spike that was in the pit.\n It was right after this, as my bard stands over the pit observing the results of his work that the rogue runs back from the forest screaming,\"The Minotaur is after me, the Minotaur is after me!\". My bard runs off away from him worried that he is going to get caught. As the frightened rogue sprints past my bard grabs him by the collar and asks him, \"what Minotaur there are none chasing after you?\". The rogue chaises out of my grip screaming,\"he is coming.\" and sprints off before tripping (5 on balance check) on a tree root and falls collapsing of exhaustion and banging his head on a tree. My Bard then picks him up and carries him into town. There he takes him to the clerics. \nHe is stopped by Guards who are looking for the barbarian, who should have showed up by this time. \nMy bard says he died and fell in a pit and that the rogue can prove his story. So the bard then convinces one of the guards to take the rogue with him to the jail to be healed and questioned. My bard is questioned and says that the barbarian sprinted up ahead and that the group had came upon him like he was. They go and take my bard back to the cells striping him of his sword and armor, leaving him only with commoner's clothes. They then wake up the rogue and question him. He tells the truth and says,\" The half-elf was staring over the pit and when he heard me approaching he ran off in the opposite direction.\". It is at this point that my bard is told he will spend time in the cells. so My bard wanting the rogue there to help him tells the guards that he was in on it too. The guards then take both of us down to the cells where along the way I explain in elven to the rogue what I plan on doing. \nWe go to the cells where we meat the dwarf cleric who got arrested for causing trouble when he was drunk. At this point my sisters char and the shard mind who had been exploring some tunnels happen to come out in one of the cells.  down the hall way and around a bend. The Shardmidn splits himself apart and shoots himself through the cell bars. He then follows the sound of my character screaming at the guards, who had left the floor and finds him, the rogue, and the dwarf in the cell with another rogue in  the next cell. \nWe ran out of time there but next session my bard is going to be haunted by the ghost of the barbarian because my char murdered him in cold blood...and also my bard will figure out that he meant to help him by hitting him again and that barbarians are just stupid.\nTl;dr: My bard pulled a 300 and dropped the halfling barbarian down a pit in cold blood because my bard and the halfling hated each other.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zlxls/35_that_time_i_became_the_bbeg_1/",
        "text": "**TL;DR**: This is a long one, sorry. Piracy, magical amulet, betrayal, deals with demons, the occasional Kraken, betrayal, slavery. In that order.\n\nThis was a 3.5e game a friend ran in November. It was relatively short campaign, but was still a lot of fun. Our GM for the time (because we took turns) had a homebrew setting based on the Carribean but with fantasy races. There were pirates and royalists and everything. It was a fairly mid-level (10 or so) campaign, and the party was as follows: Ajrec the human-hating halfing ranger (me), Kragthor the garden-gnome barbarian (who was essentially invincible), and Felicia Night the half-elf sorceress. \n\nThe campaign opened with the party aboard a ship, speaking with the captain about our payment. Suddenly the port at which we were docked was attacked by the Red Pirate Marley, leader of the Crimson Sails. This is basically shot-for-shot the attack on Port Royal from Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Our ship went down, but we got away with the booty. Turns out Marley was after the very special necklace we had, called the Amulet of the Blood-Tide. Which, as luck would have it, could summon an undead fleet every 100 years, and could only be destroyed after tossing it into the volcano that was at the center of this island chain.\n\nWe abscond with the Amulet, burying it like pirates do, then return to town to talk to some contacts, including the provincial governor who has some interest in enchanted artifacts. We happened to have the Amulet's sister artifact, called the Sword of the Ancient Mariner (which could overcome the sea-sickness that came with putting on the Amulet, but we'll get to that), which we sold to the governor for a hefty pile of gold, and information. Then we betrayed his ass and stole a big freakin' ship.\n\nWe head south, to the Tortuga-equivalent of this setting to parley with Marley. Instead of actually getting there, we decide to preempt the destruction of the Amulet and head into the so-called Eye of the Florians. The anticipated dramatically-necessary storm begins, and bunch of merpeople jump on the deck. We are getting our asses handed to us. These merpeople were a good 2 or 3 CRs above us, and there was a Kraken headed our way.\n\nI roll a 19 on Plot Sense (aka metagaming), pass the GM a note saying I go below-decks to try and save our asses. I open the chest with the Amulet, and put that sucker on. I am almost immediately transfigured into this horrible half-halfing half-Davy Jones looking creature, with strong extendable tentacles on one half of my body and mostly a mostly halfling appearance on the other. The transfiguration is painful, and leaves me sea-sick for a time. Meanwhile, the others are actually holding their own against the merfolk, but the Kraken is beginning its attack.\n\nOf course, as if dramatically appropriate, I suddenly have a mental connection with the Kraken, and some amount of control over the weather. I climb onto the deck, and wipe the floor with the merfolk, then calm both the Kraken and the seas. My companions turn and see what looks vaguely like me. They are confused and shocked and variety of other negative emotion, including freaking angry. At this point, I haven't quite gained control over my speech, and it ends up sounding blubbery and muffled, like I'm trying to talk under water, so they can't understand that I was doing this to protect them, and to save their lives. These people were my friends and not human, therefore we were pretty much cool. Until they tried to kill me.\n\nI jumped off the side of the ship and rode the Kraken out of there, to wallow in despair and plan my revenge. Wearing the amulet gave me knowledge of the sea's deepest secrets, including another enormous sea creature called the Leviathan. I had various sea creatures harass those above the water, focusing on disrupting trade and ideally news of my so-called betrayal. Meanwhile, my former compatriots contacted both Marley and the governor, and convinced them to engage in talks on the shores of the volcanic island. Kragthor married some half-orc, and Felicia did Sorceress-y things, I guess. I can't really speak to what they did while I was away, the GM asked me to step out. They decided to stick with Marley, because he paid better and wasn't a complete slime like the governor was. On the eve of our epic final battle, Marley's Crimson Sails absolutely obliterated the Imperial fleet that was dispatched to capture me.\n\nMeanwhile, I was marshaling my own forces. I heard whale-speak of two supernatural ships haunting the seas: a ghost ship, which I blew out into trade routes, further disrupting them, and some sort of demon ship. This was manned by a variety of devilish critters, mostly speaking infernal and that sort of thing. We struck a deal: my soul in exchange for their assistance in destroying human life in the Florians, starting with the fleet gathered against me. I failed to corral the Leviathan (my Handle Animal skill wasn't exactly a focus). With what I could muster behind me, I made for the Eye.\n\nDeath and destruction abound, but not by my hand. At first the waste of human lives brought my character joy, but then I saw that it was mostly Imperial ships that still burned in the water surrounding the island. This should have been my first clue. I walk on shore, and I am once again a halfling. I'm still wearing the Amulet, but the abilities it confers are gone. I scan the wreckage and see the bloated corpse of the governor. There is a note pinned to his chest, which I read, of course. Throughout this campaign my compatriots called me Abednego (as in Shadrach, Meshach, and...) as a joke, because they're asshats. The note said \"Abednego is stupid,\" and had a rather crude drawing of, well, me. Then it blew up in my face, dealing enough damage to almost kill me. Felicia and Kragthor leap out of the sand, formerly disguised as dead bodies on the beach, and they engage. I try to escape, but they knock me the hell out in one hit.\n\nThey take the Amulet and throw it into the mouth of the volcano, destroying it. The Blood Tide does not come, and the undead fleet sleeps forever. Marley arrives with his fleet, and Felicia and Kragthor convince Marley to not kill me, instead I'm sold into slavery. Again, actually. Ajrec hates humans because he was kept as a slave for most of his early life, until he killed his masters and escaped. So, there was I, in shackles and stripped of my belongings and all dignity. Kragthor looks on, still disgusted at my betrayal. Felicia is only mildly perturbed by my being sold into slavery, since she made a fair bit of gold. I'm stuck on the ship, doing my ranger-y/halfling-y thing slipping my manacles, as the ship sails off into the horizon.\n\nFar off in the distance, a ship follows, with black flags and devil's pitchfork on the flag, the distinct smell of sulfur mixing with the salt air. I won't be a slave for long. Not in this life. A knowing smile creeps over my face.\n\nFIN ",

        "text": "I've posted this story in a tale topic thread before, but I decided to make it a post of its own. These events took place almost a year in real time before the other stories I've posted, so the party consists of mostly different people.\n\nNearing the end of a campaign involving the apocalypse, our heroes travel to the icy wastes seeking a villain who has been threatening them for some time and is now working to bring about the end of the world. This evil sorceress has seized control of a cult devoted to the worship of Veccna (who I, at the time, had mistakenly believed to be a goddess of betrayal), so the players decided to infiltrate the group to find her. The initiation process involved betraying someone who trusted them, so they staged a scene wherein two of the characters, our tiefling rogue and our dwarf fighter, appeared to betray the rest of the party. They succeeded in the Performance and Bluff checks to make it believable and were allowed to join the cult of the Traitor Goddess.\n\nNow, right off the bat, the fighter's player was confused by this whole concept. For reference, he's this big South African guy with biceps the size of my head, two black belts, and a knack for philosophy. Fucking love that guy. Anyway, he doesn't see how a cult can worship, and therefore be loyal to, a goddess who encourages and rewards betrayal. I tell him not to worry about it, advice the rogue has no trouble following; right off the bat on the first night, she starts snooping around. The fighter, however, remains troubled.\n\nWhile the rogue is out at nights gathering intel, the fighter spends the session and his days in game much the same way: quietly thinking and asking various questions about the cult and its structure. One night, at the rogue's urging, he leaves his room to wander around. I ask him what he's hoping to find, he says he doesn't know. Then the bastard rolls very poorly and is discovered by a guard. I pull out the table I'd drawn up for interrogation and rub my hands together in anticipation, but when the guard asks him what he's doing out at this time he just says he was going for a walk. I realize that he doesn't have to roll Bluff, because this is actually true. The guard sends him back to his room, and that's that. The rogue, meanwhile, continues to roll well and gather more information about the villain they're here looking for.\n\nThe next day, the fighter strikes up a conversation with and befriends one of the cultists. The other players and I are becoming increasingly concerned that he is beginning to drink the Kool-Aid. He invites his new friend to take a walk with him, and the two head outside the hidden base, discussing the nature of their goddess. Then the fighter slows down a few paces and attacks his new friend from behind. I blink. I tell him to roll. He rolls well. The cultist's skull is crushed, he falls like a sack of wet shit. Everyone at the table is baffled. Fighter walks back inside, other cultists notice blood all over him, ask what happened. He confesses what he has done and explains, his player sporting this huge fucking grin, that by gaining this man's trust and then murdering him, he has committed an ideal act of betrayal and thus done the will of their goddess. I laugh. Then I think about it. Can't find fault in his logic. Fighter gets promoted within the cult's hierarchy.\n\nWe're all getting pretty nervous about the fighter at this point, but the rogue dutifully continues her mission, and that night it pays off. Using the intel she's gathered and a very high roll, she manages to track down the private quarters of the villain they've been hunting. I expect her to use this information to set up some clever bullshit, play the long con. Instead, she goes up and picks the door lock. She rolls well, and enters the room. The villain is sleeping, but she has supernaturally badass senses and the rogue knows this, in and out of character. She rolls to sneak in anyway, and manages to clear the crazy high DC. So this rogue glides into the room like a shadow, and I'm thinking she's just going to sneak around, read her secret plot-important papers and such, maybe sabotage some of her dangerous magic shit to blow up and kill her. She reads the papers alright, but then she announces her intention to walk up and kill the villain. I blink. Tell her there's no way she's going to get that close to this sorceress, considering her badass senses and all the magical wards she's set up to warn her of just such a thing. Rogue rolls anyway. Crits the roll. Walks right up to the sleeping form of a major, plot-important villain, and slits her throat. For all her power, she was still mortal. My next big boss battle dies in her sleep.\n\nThe rogue, understandably, is pretty fucking pleased with herself. When the villain dies, her excess magical power exploded out of her body and blew a hole in the ceiling, alerting every cultist in the base. Rogue rolls to climb out of the hole, and of course she fucking succeeds. She gets the fuck out, and leaves the fighter in the lion's den. Cult's second in command calls an emergency meeting, declares that their beloved leader has been murdered and that revenge must be had. The village where the rest of the party is currently staying is the only town nearby in this frozen wasteland, making it the only logical place the murder could have fled to, so the new leader calls the cultist to mount up and ride to the village and burn it to the ground in retribution. I ask the fighter if he wants to sneak away and try to warn his friends that the mob is coming, he says no. He mounts his horse and prepares to ride. Party is shitting themselves, I am one step away from making the fighter evil and removing him from play. The cult rides out, their new leader at the head of their procession. Fighter rides his horse up alongside the leader. Then he takes out his hammer and slams it into the guy's chest. He rolls well. With the forward momentum he had going, the cult leader's chest cavity collapses and he dies instantly, tumbling down into the snow to be trampled by his followers. My fucking face when.\n\nThe cultists all bring their horses to a stop surrounding the fighter, and he commands them all to be silent. Rolls very well, the mob quiets down. Then the fighter, his player rising from his seat, delivers a well-reasoned, eloquent speech about the folly of worshiping a goddess who encourages the act of betrayal. By betraying this cult and the goddess herself, he has, paradoxically, done her will most effectively. I can't even recall the entire speech, but it was beautiful. I can tell he's been preparing this thesis throughout the entire session, so I have him roll Persuasion. That glorious South African son of a bitch rolls a double twenty. I sit back and pause for a moment while the players lose their shit, then explain that the cultists, hearing the wisdom of his words, put down their weapons and depart, returning to their homes, denouncing Veccna and her cult. The fighter returns to the party, triumphant, and they continue their adventures.",

        "text": "As promised, the Air Force has dropped off a footlocker at the gates of the most magical place in the world. Inside, there's a package of new technology. They're grenades called Screamers. They do exactly what you think. There's also a radio rig so they can stay in touch with their rescuers, and three pounds of C4 with detonators. When Sparks lays eyes on the C4, his eyes light up. \"It's beautiful.\"\n\nThe survivor they picked up in the Water Park says that there's no reason  for them to walk to the Castle for Evac. There's an underground tunnel system, and if there are any survivors, they're likely to be there. Leading the way to the tunnels, the party finds another seven people, all mascots, all immune. Three of these are player characters joining in at the last moment.\n\nPeter Pan, Woody, and Mulan are all armed and prepared for the coming assault. The plan is to use the screamers to create noise in another part of the park, the jungle cruise being the winner of the vote. But if they're going to ensure the survival of everyone, that's going to be part A of the plan. Part B is to get everyone into Cinderella's castle and cut off all but one way in. The main drawbridge is the best option because it can easily be reduced to single file.\n\nMoonie and Sparks take some time to lay a secondary diversion in one of the attractions. This is going to be a combination of Screamers and C4 over loadbearing structures and when it happens, the attraction will be gone, but hopefully, a lot of infected will be as well.\n\nThe last part of the plan, as they get their survivors in through the tunnels to the castle, is to sabotage the horde's chances of getting to the drawbridge in the first place. Sooraya makes the rolls necessary to find a large drum of floor cleaner and between ber and Mulan, they spread it in an arc in front of the castle. With luck, they can get the horde to slip all over each other.\n\nThe last survivor is inside the castle, and mack engages the first event. Even from the castle, the high decibel of the Screamers can be heard from the Jungle Cruise ride. The horde is immediately attracted to it. Everyone who is waiting in the castle takes their positions.\n\n\"Little John, this is Robin Hood. Begin the Evac. We've set up the ones who need medical attention by the Helipad.\" Moonie says over the radio.\n\n\"Copy that, Robin Hood. How many do you have total?\"\n\n\"Fifteen civilians who can't or won't fight. Seven of us protecting them. What's your ETA, Little John?\"\n\n\"Three minutes.\"\n\nWhat followed was thirty minutes of intense dice rolling, as they worked towards getting the survivors out of Disney. All the traps they had laid made it easier for them to conserve ammo, but that doesn't mean it's easy.\n\nAs the second load of survivors is choppered out, it almost looks like how they got into Disney is going to be mirrored as a Smoker extends its tongue into the rescue chopper. Sooraya loses her last butcher knife, burying it inbetween the smoker's eyes. The smoker falls away and the tongue goes limp. Once Peter Pan cuts through it, the chopper takes off without any issue, leaving one more load of survivors before the PCs can get out.\n\nThe chopper taking off has summoned another horde, but thankfully, it's time for Moonie and Sparks to kick in their plan. Two screamers are set off inside It's a Small World, luring the zombies in. After five minutes, Moonie presses the detonator, and the entire attraction goes up with a fireball, because one of the blocks of C4 was placed near an open gasline.\n\n\"Robin Hood, what was that?\" The chopper calls over the radio.\n\n\"A public service!\" Moonie responds and Mulan finishes the thought \"Even the ones who work here hate 'It's a Small World.'\n\nWhen the horde gathers for a final push on the castle, Sooraya whistles, and the Beast infected starts pummeling any infected that get close to his princess. Unfortunately, Beast falls to the combined might of two tanks, but not before the last of the civilians makes it safely aboard the chopper.\n\nThe party has to hold out for another five minutes against the infected, but all move up to the helipad for extraction. When \"Little John\" returns, they're finally happy to be out.\n\n\"Where you guys going?\" The pilot asks as they clear the gates. \n\n\"Fort Dix. We need to report back that it was a successful mission.\" Moonie says. \"And though we lost two of ours, one of them deserves a posthumous commendation.\"\n\nIt's a quiet trip back to the Fort, and as the survivors disembark, they're met by the commanding officer who stares at them blankly.\n\n\"How the hell did you survive? There was no way that you should have been this successful. Your mission was a dog and pony show.\"\n\n\"With respect, sir...if you had wanted the mission to fail, you should have sent the CDC.\" Sparks answers. \"We got the job done. 4 went in, 22 came out. That's pretty good in my good.\"\n\nAt this moment, the radio sparks to life. \"This is Smithsonian Forward Base. We are overrun! Send backup! Send...\" the radio dies down.\n\nMoonie looks at the team. \"Who's up for a trip to D.C.?\" The mascots shake their heads. They have families to get back to. Sooraya nods, however. \"I have to ensure my country's embassy is not overrun. Count me in.\"\n\nThe four main survivors requisition a Jeep and drive off towards the zombies in DC.\n\nTHE END.",

The effect is that the camel has advantage on stealth checks.\n\nOn a quest, our rogue is in a village sowing rumors. Meanwhile, the rest of our party tried to investigate our mark. We needed to roll stealth checks for investigate. Just for laughs, I decided to roll a stealth check for the camel. For the first time in our campaign, I rolled a double crit for the stealth check. So the DM decides that the camel camouflaged so well that we can no longer find the camel.\n\nDuring the next few days, while the rogue is sowing rumors, the rest of the party decides to carouse in the town. The DM decides that the camel is also carousing because of stealth. Of the four days that the camel is carousing, he made a small fortune gambling, then was robbed of all of its fortune, then made 900 gold gambling. Out of the entire party, the camel made more money than any of us. Of course, the DM rules that the camel gets to keep all the gold that he wins.\n\nSo now there is a legend of the camouflaged camel in the town of Bomar.",

        "text": "The ~~terrible~~ ~~awesome~~ insane thing about playing with a GM with a decade of experience in World of Darkness games is when he's trying to think of new ideas to pull in, he pulls *from all of them.* Which is why in our current Vampire campaign, one of our players has been off fucking around with Etherite mages and Void Engineers in the orbit of Jupiter.\n\nI'll back up a bit to set the scene. Early in the game, our Tremere player, Georgia, fell in with an Etherite mage based here in San Francisco. Rather than run screaming for the hills the first time he accidentally half-incinerated someone with a death ray, Georgia became totally enamored with him and his \"Science\" and started hanging around with him in the hopes she might learn something to supplement her own magical powers. Surprisingly, this has worked out well, largely because her character is so cheerfully oblivious to the moral horrors and personal dangers of the World of Darkness, to the point where she is sometimes the creepiest character in the entire game. (Just as an example, she reacted to the prospect of draining six humans of blood in order to reactivate the Tremere Chantry wards with frustration at having to find volunteers.) She didn't bat an eye when the mage asked her to track down werewolf bones for an experiment he's running, and when he later proposed to teleport her to Pluto for another materials-gathering mission, she leaped at the chance to further advance Science.\n\nThe mage tried to teleport her to Pluto, which understandably went awry, and she ended up getting caught in a battle between a *different* Etherite mage and a Void Engineer ship. She ends up trapped on the disabled Void Engineer ship, where she is captured, interrogated, and ultimately offered her life in exchange for using a Tremere-magic blood circle to teleport them off the ship to Pluto, to safety.\n\nThey quickly learn what the players all figured out months ago, that having Georgia as an ally [can be measurably more terrifying than having her as an enemy.](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2015_02_05_pluto_circle.mp3)\n\n(And no, the Void Engineers did not go along with that plan.)\n\nHopefully the new bot will link to my previous posts. \n\nedit: Hmm, apparently it's not working. Alright, well, here they are anyway:\n\n* [Why you don't give a Brujah nice things](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2phxnk/vampire_the_masquerade_why_you_dont_give_a_brujah/)\n* [The Anti-diceshaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2syis9/vampire_the_masquerade_the_antidiceshaming_or_how/)\n* [Why Cellphones aren't game-breaking](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2v0x6a/vampire_the_masquerade_why_cellphones_arent/)\n* [The Economics of Goat Husbandry](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2w7snu/vampire_the_masquerade_the_economics_of_goat/)\n\n[Full-length writeups of our game can be found on our blog.](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com/)",

The famous Spaceship Earth has been burned, leaving nothing but a blackened hull.\n\nStill, they follow the radio signal to a gift shop. Underneath the gift shop is a safe room, built by a madman, but now used by a family. \"Do you have food? My kids haven't eaten anything but sugary candy in a week.\" the mother asks, handing the children out one by one.\n\nOutside the shop, Sooraya flings one of her knives, burying it in the head of a Spitter before it can release its acidic burst. Rather that retrieve it and risk damage that way, she accepts a handgun from Mack.\n\n\"Is there anyone else alive here?\" Sparks asks the woman as he helps her into the Duck.\n\n\"There might be someone left at Soarin'. I remember saying they were going to climb up to the top to avoid the Beast.\"\n\n\"Beast? Another infected mascot?\" Sooraya asks. \"What can we expect from that one?\"\n\n\"Aside from superhuman strength, he has a roar that can shatter brick. He roams Epcot, looking for something or someone.\" She falls asleep in the Duck while her kids get the food.\n\n\"We've got to be careful with that one, certainly. Let's head for Soarin'.\"\n\nMost of the passageways are blocked, so they have to detour through the international alley, and that's when things get weird. A horde of infected, still wearing their authentic international costumes attack. 35 infected against 4 fighters.\n\nMack takes a gash across his arm, and Moonie almost loses his toes, but they manage to pull through and beat the horde, and the Boomer that came around to call more.\n\nStanding at the base of the Soarin' Ride, Moonie lights a flare to signal the guy on top, who slides down the chains of the ride and makes a dramatic entrance.\n\nThis new guy calls himself \"Ronin\" and he's a typical nineties' power character. Trenchcoat, Katana, ponytail.\n\nRonin says he's left a cache of technology inside Spaceship Earth, and they just need to get to it. It's not really useful things, just remote controlled cars that make a loud noise, speakers and sound equipment \"salvaged\" from the nightclubs in the area. Still, they can probably use it, so they head for the husk.\n\nRonin decides he wants to take point to show everyone how it's done. And to be fair to him, he seems to know exactly where to slice at an infected to eliminate mobility.\n\nThe cache of toys and sound equipment is inside what used to be the technology display area, surrounded by a 30 deep horde. This is when the party decides to get tactical. Sooraya is sent up on a high shelf to shoot from the left. Moonie and Mack take up positions under Sooraya and under a \"You must be this tall sign\" and Sparks takes the rear.\n\nRonin however, says \"Screw Strategy\" and wades in, blocking line of sight for all his fellow survivors. It goes fairly well until a Hunter pounces him. Through the incredible luck of matched rolls, Ronin and Hunter start a lethal dance, neither one giving the other any leeway for six turns. By this point, the others have collected his gear, and turn to get the Hunter off him. But this time, the Hunter gets the lucky roll and plunges his claws into Ronin's neck.\n\nIt's the second PC death in the campaign, and it happened even before there was a chance for character redemption. Still after shooting the Hunter, the party searches for more equipment, and finds a few radio components and more food and first aid.\n\nTheir next plan would be to get back to the Mighty Duck, but that's cut short as the wall nearest them is bellowed down.\n\nThere's the Beast, rampaging towards them. Moonie gets knocked into an information kiosk. Mack is pummeled across the room. Sparks is kicked and sprawls to the ground.\n\nSooraya seems unharmed. She looks down, and realizes what's going on. \"I'm wearing Belle's outfit! He thinks I'm Belle.\" She tests this by holding out her hand to the infected and it kneels down next to her.\n\n\"I think we've got a friend now.\" They bring Beast back to the Duck, and after calming down the survivors, put him to work clearing the road so they can make their way to the Magic Kingdom.\n\nAt this point, the radio on the duckboat crackles to life. \"Attention vehicle. This is a USAF rescue team. What is your destination?\"\n\n\"We're going to the Magic Kingdom to rescue survivors.\" Mack answers. \"Can we get an evac there? We're likely to have at least ten survivors, not counting ourselves.\"\n\n\"We can get a chopper to Cinderella's Castle. If you can hold off the infected, we can get those people out of there.\" There's some chatter between officers and finally the comms officer speaks again. \"We're going to drop some useful gear in a foot locker in front of the gate. Use it however you see fit.\"\n\n\"Roger that. See you there.\" It's going to be quite a drive to the Magic Kingdom, but they know they're almost in the clear.\n\nStay tuned for Part 4: Small World, Sonic Disturbance and the Seige of the Castle.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zajkd/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_a_heros_rebirth/",
        "text": "Someone on /r/kamenrider suggested I share a story about a semi-recent Kamen Rider-inspired Mutants and Masterminds campaign. After racking my brain, trying to think of a relevant story, I decided to relate the tale of a PC's triumphant return to the campaign after two months of absence.\n\nBefore I begin in earnest, I've decided to preemptively answer a burning question: “What the hell is Kamen Rider?” Kamen Rider is a Japanese live action superhero franchise that has aired in Japan since the early 70s (the franchise will be celebrating 45 years next year). In it, heroes (usually a lone hero joined by another person halfway through the show) battle monsters in rubber suits utilizing the same sorts of powers as the monsters. This can be everything from using the monsters as power-ups to actually being monsters themselves. If this sounds a bit like Power Rangers to you, you'd be right; they're in the same genre. In fact, Super Sentai, the franchise Power Rangers is adapted from, shares a Sunday morning television block with Kamen Rider (Sentai airs right before Rider).\n\nWhen we decided to play a Kamen Rider campaign, our group brainstormed collectively as to what sort of setting we wanted to run; what we ended up with was an amalgamation of ideas from previous Rider shows that we thought were cool. We then decided on an aesthetic theme for the series; we combined chess and tarot, which gave us chess piece-themed Riders and monsters, powered by tarot card collectibles. We then incorporated a toy gimmick (because Kamen Rider is merchandise-driven); the Riders' Drivers (the belt-like devices that allow them to transform into their superhero alter-egos) have three card slots; two for weapons, and one for a finishing move. Each of the special tarot cards you slot in (modeled after the Major Arcana – collect all 22!) makes a different sound and summons a different weapon for each belt.\n\nWe started off with four people, not including our GM.\n\n* **Kamen Rider Errant**, a *ronin* (used in the sense of 'someone who hasn't passed his college entrance exams') searching for those responsible for his father's grisly murder. A send-up of every asshole secondary Rider that ever lived. (If you're familiar with the franchise proper, he's essentially the bastard child of Kaito Kumon and Mutsuki Kamijo)\n* **Kamen Rider Legion**, a mechanic in Checkmate's motor pool who wants to break free of his humdrum, blue-collar life and become a hero of justice. He was modeled after more idealistic secondary Riders. (Basically Arata Kagami as a mechanic)\n* **Kamen Rider Bastion**, a doctor who believes in the inherit goodness of mankind who is nevertheless grappling with growing dissatisfaction with his working conditions; essentially, he hates his co-workers. This was my character, and his characterization changed so much during the course of the game that it defies proper categorization. (A younger, more pessimistic Akira Date is about the closest)\n* **Kamen Rider Cardinal**, who was the 'main character' of the campaign; a young reporter who thought Checkmate had something to do with his parents' disappearance a few years ago (they did). (A combination of Shinji Kido's occupation, Souji Tendou's general backstory, Shotaro Hidari's demeanor, and Eiji Hino's fashion sense)\n\nLater on, Bastion got framed for murder and thrown in jail. During the course of the \"Get Bastion Out Of Jail\" sideplot, I rolled up another character:\n\n* **Kamen Rider Redoubt II**, Bastion's defense attorney, who has a reputation as \"the miracle worker\". She briefly acted as Kamen Rider Bastion, but took an evil Rider's belt (in her debut fight!) that she used once Bastion was out of jail. (My entire character concept for Redoubt was \"what if Nao Nagisawa had played Kamen Rider Zolda?\")\n\nTogether, they fought a group of monsters codenamed “Dark Players” that have placed a major metropolitan city that is *definitely not Tokyo* under siege. The city, with the help of construction firm-turned-paramilitary outfit Checkmate, erect a wall around most of the downtown area. This splits the city in two; the walled-in area is called the Quarantine Zone, while the area between the wall and the Japan Self-Defense Forces' defensive perimeter is the Occupied Zone.\n\nAfter a few sessions, however, the guy who played Legion had to leave the campaign (he had to move to New York, and after he moved had various technical issues that prevented him from rejoining us right away), and instead of killing his character off, we decided his belt would be destroyed, and his character would live on as an (unpowered) NPC. As the campaign continued, Errant turned “traitor” against the party (actually a ploy to make Cardinal stronger), leaving Cardinal, Bastion, and Redoubt (at this point, I was playing both) as the only “good” Riders left in the campaign.\n\nEventually, our missing player finally resolved his technical issues, and wished to return to the game. He worked in secret with the DM to determine exactly how that was going to happen. When we met up the next time, the good Riders had made a startling discovery; there was a giant hatchery of Dark Players located underneath the city, and there was no way to tell when they would all hatch and flow into the Quarantine Zone. Since we escaped the burrow from a different exit than where we originally entered, we were stuck in the Occupied Zone without our vehicles (Cardinal and Bastion had the traditional motorcycles, while Redoubt drove her car). We returned to the place we had left our rides to discover a family of refugees huddled near the car, being tormented by one of the Dark Player generals and a band of combatants. \n\nWe transform and head in to fight... and we immediately get our heads handed to us by the dice. The general beats the crap out of each of us (I can't remember, but I think someone got knocked out of their transformation). We were considering just telling the refugees to pile into Redoubt's car and booking it, saving the general for another day...\n\n...and then the lead monster gets body-checked by an oncoming motorcycle and sidecar. Before he can parse what's going on, the general then suffers a flying kick from the cyclist. The helmeted rider takes off his helmet... it's Legion. In-character, everyone's surprised (even though we all knew he was coming back this session). And then, Legion grins, jumps into the sidecar and buckles up. He pulls out a black disc, slots it into the belt buckle, and utters the iconic Rider transformation phrase.. 'Henshin!”\n\nThe sidecar starts folding out and changing like a mini-Transformer around him, turning into a brand new suit. Our returning PC had become the campaign's first true secondary Rider, Kamen Rider Draughts. He proceeds to turn the tide of the fight in our favor by virtue of his new powers (a super-speed punching Black form and a stretchy-arm Red form), and we manage to rally behind him, beating the monsters and saving the day. Most importantly, the general in question was the last general before the Big Bad, so we had set in motion the last leg of the campaign.",

The defenders, young though they are, are given full adult status in the local clan structures, and even the clan chieftain, Rorik Baldurrich, seeks audience with the \"Heroes of Azamek.\"\n\nGlorin, Barazun, Sven and Durgen find themselves in Baldurrich's office, where they agree to lead a retaliatory strike against the Duergar stronghold. Baldurrich also mentions that he's heard about the talking painting they found in their last raid on the Duergar, and while he doesn't know exactly what it means, he'd be very interested in any more information the young Dwarves can turn up. \n\nAnd so the newly minted heroes end up at the head of a small army of hardened Dwarven warriors, headed for the Duergar's home. They chant, sing, stomp, and generally make as much noise as Dwarvenly possible en route. \n\nFinding the first Duergar outpost seemingly undefended, morale is up. Clearly their cowardly foes have fallen back to their inner sanctums, fleeing the Dwarven advance. As they pass more deserted defenses, however, the Dwarves start to grow nervous. Something doesn't feel right, down in these tunnels. \n\nThey reach a massive cavern, from the floor of which rise large, squat stalagmites that seem to have been hollowed out for use as dwellings. The grime of centuries or millennia of unwashed Duergar clings to every surface, and the sharp smell of blood hangs in the air, but no Duergar seem to be present. The Dwarves split up to cover the ground more quickly, and Glorin, Barazun, Sven and Durgen are dispatched down the center of the cavern to search for any sort of command structure they can find. \n\nThe first body looms suddenly into Barazun's view as he moves within his darkvision's range of it, a female Duergar impaled on a sharp stone spike. Moving closer, more and more come into view, until all four of the young Deepwardens can see a circle of two dozen such spikes, each bearing the body of a Duergar female or child. Their blood has pooled and dried in the middle of the circle, but a trail of it stretches of into the darkness. Barazun and Sven, holy men that they are, recognize this as a summoning ritual, but neither has any idea what could be so awful as to require this much death to bring into this world. \n\nAfter a brief argument over Sven's desire to animate one of the impaled Duergar for use as cannon fodder (which Barazun emphatically refuses to allow), they follow he blood trail to a set of stairs that lead up into a hollowed out pillar that connects the cavern's ceiling and floor. Within, they find only a stone throne, upon which lies a the body of a Duergar wearing a battered iron crown, his throat slit viciously. The blood trail disappears behind the throne, and as they approach, a voice speaks to them from out of the darkness. \n\n\"The king of this place called me up to perform two tasks. The first is to deliver some sordid message about 'you killed all of his people,' and 'unholy vengeance even at the price of his people's blood.' I wasn't paying much attention, to be honest. The second task, the important thing, is that I am here to kill as many Dwarves as possible.\"\n\nAt which point [this thing](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5505/11625083975_a6f0ce96aa_b.jpg) steps out from behind the throne, and everything goes to hell. \n\nSven and Glorin, crossbows always at the ready, put two bolts in the monster as soon as it comes into view. Barazun prays for protection, and Durgen almost pisses himself. The devil moves fast, circling around the party and opening a gash across Durgen's chest with a flick of it's glaive before the bowmen can reload. Barazun calls on the power of his god, Hanseath, to enhance his blows, and charges headfirst into the devil, headbutts apparently still being his weapon of choice. Sven, meanwhile shouts excitedly in Aklo and turns into a troglodyte. Durgen smacks the thing with his hammer, but the devil hardly seems to notice. \n\nThe dwarves have the thing half surrounded now, and after all they've been through it seems like they can't lose, infernal monster or no. Unfortunately for them, the infernal monster in question has other plans, as well as a reach weapon. Splitting his next attack between Barazun and Sven, he catches them both the blade of his glaive, and the healers quickly realize there is something horribly wrong with the wounds, which refuse to stop bleeding. \n\nGlorin discards his bow to launch his trident at the devil, but manages to cut his own hand on the razor points, beginning to bleed profusely himself. Sven tries to cast a commanding spell on the devil, but the creature shakes it off easily and stabs him again. Barazun retreats to a distance from which his healing burst will hit only his allies, and the devil strikes Durgen again, more severely than before. \n\nGlorin manages to lob his trident without hurting himself this time, but the devil's armored carapace deflects the blow. Sven tries to cast another command spell, but again the devil resists, and as soon as Barazun uses his healing burst, the beast brings the glaive down hard on Durgen, punching straight through the poor bastard's shield and on into his chest. Durgen falls like bag of stones. \n\nGlorin, enraged at the sight of his fallen comrade, takes up his bow once again and manages to put a bolt in the devil's thigh, opening whatever passes for a femoral artery in the thing's infernal anatomy. The devil is now bleeding as profusely as everyone else, but it's still in the fight, and Sven takes the next glaive strike to the stomach, falling near Durgen. \n\nHalf the party is down, and Barazun knows that if he doesn't do something quickly the infernal bleeding will mean the end of his companions. While Glorin puts more bolts in the devil, the cleric steps up to healing burst...but can't overcome the dark magic that keeps the wounds open. He succeeds only in healing the devil, who proceeds to commend him on being such an accommodating foe. Cursing, Barazun steps up again, and smashes his head into the infernal hard enough to drive the remaining life force from the creature, and the devil collapses into a pile of ash. \n\nBarazun manages to restore his allies, and Glorin takes up the devil's glaive (as soon as Sven assures him the weapon isn't inherently evil). The Dwarves also notice a magic ring on the finger of the deceased Duergar king, and Barazun puts it on. \n\nHe immediately receives a vision of another Dwarven aerie, somewhere across the wasteland. The voice of the dead king from the talking painting tells him that the ring he wears is a key to the sealed First Halls of the Dwarves, and that this aerie is Kadharaz, where the next key can be found. \n\nReturning home, the Dwarves get a heroes feast and receive dispensation from Baldurrich to travel to Kadharaz to investigate this business of the key. Baldurrich warns them that the trek will take at least three weeks on foot, and Azamek's larders can only spare enough rations for one leg of the trip. If they're to cross the wastes, they'll have to rely on Glorin's hunting skills to procure food. \n\nThe party spends a few weeks of downtime getting ready. Glorin brushes up on his surface sruvival skills and acquires a long-awaited hippogriff mount, Barazun designs and forges a 'throwing shield' emblazoned with the Holy Tankard of Hanseath, and Sven preaches quietly about the horrors that exist beyond space and time to anyone who will listen. Finally, as ready as they'll ever be, the Dwarves set out across the surface of the wastescape continent of Urnak. \n\nThe first day passes relatively calmly, the only violence consisting of a brief skirmish with a twelve foot scorpion. After the horrors they've seen in the Underdark, giant bugs just aren't as scary as they used to be, and they make camp on a stone spur that juts out of the waste. \n\nIt's only as night falls, and far out over the planes the bonfires of the orc hordes become visible, that the young Dwarves realize that they may be in for more than just a walk on the surface.

However, this does not help you against hackers.\n\nWe were heading north out of Electrozavodsk where we had met up after spawning on the east coast. We hit the main lootspots and headed out of the danger zone before we attracted unwanted attention. When we hit the less densely forested area between Vishnoye and Staroye, we saw a heli crash site in one of the fields. We were in a good mood and had fresh Enfields and backpacks so we thought \"Why not?\". \n\nWe sneaked past the few zeds guarding the wreckage and began looting. Unfortunately someone had been there before us and there was not much left. We picked up some medical supplies, including a bloodbag (now saline kit), my friend found an AKM, and we went on our merry way. Or so we thought.\n\nAn eardrum-shattering bang sent us both flying out of our desk chairs and hitting the deck prone. With sore knees, courtesy of the underside of our desks, we quickly assessed our situation and mutually decided that withdrawal would be the preferable course of action. Or less eloquently put we both shouted \"RUUUUN!!\" and ran about in squiggly lines as two beheaded chickens before deciding on east as a general direction.\n\nWe regrouped a few minutes run later around some trees and bushes next to a dirt path. Our hearts are racing and we are both giggling like schoolgirls from the excitement. After a few moments to calm down we analyzed what had happened and tried to puzzle our situation together in hindsight. We decided that whoever had been at the crash site before us must have set up satchel charges and hunkered down at the northern hill to ambush whoever came second. Why he had not set of the charges when we were close enough to the heli to die from them we did not know. I took the liberty of assuming he had zoned out while waiting or simply did not figure out how to set them off until it was too late.We also both confirmed with each other that rifle shots had been fired from the north hill. \n\nSo we decided to try and hook around north-east, northwest and finally southwest to catch our assailant in his rear. But before we did, another explosion deafened us, this time the explosion and been right next to the dirt path and severely injured both of us. We returned fire and continued on east while taking fire from the woods to our south. At this point we are both wearing our big boy pants and lucky baseball caps. \n\n\"It's on\" - I say with as much drama as I can muster.\n\"And this time it's personal\" - My friend replies, equally dramatic.\n\nAgain, giggling like little girls we both agreed that it had to be an AS50 sniper out little buddy was using. It has quite the distinct sound.\n\nAnother 10 minutes run later and we found ourselves in another shrubbery next to a fields and some ruins, this time the fire came as soon as we stopped, and from the east. We both decided that this is not someone legitimate hunting us, he is moving far too quickly and always knows exactly where we are. We return fire and manage to confirm our suspicions when we see our assailant pop into nonexistence before our eyes.\n\n\"Little bitch!!\"\n\nThe words are said with two mouths as one as we decide to make a stand. I run across the field to find some cover next too some trees, we figure that if we spread out  but stay in range it will be easier to cover each other.\n\nA bullet whistles its merry tune past my ear as I pass the middle of the field. A vicious flow of obscenities pass my lips as I panicked try to find cover where none exist. I hunker down prone behind a rock large enough to cover about three apples and pray to the Arma gods of Bohemia to save me. Luckily, before I make any promises involving chastity or life in servitude my friend sends the hacker scum teleporting once again.\n\n\"I think I hit him this time\" - He proclaims as he scans the ruins and nearby forest.\n\nIm too scared to move, my heart is pounding and I have one of the worst cases of tunnelvision in clinical history, staring blankly at the spot were there previously stood a ghillie draped sniper.\n\nSuddenly, I'm staring at a pair of knees. \n\nMy mind is drawing the blank of a lifetime and after what seems like an eternity I manage to process whats happening. I look up and see the sniper standing just a couple of feet in front of me, aiming for my oblivious friend. I panic beyond the point of communication and a combination of nonsense and hellspeak breaks our silence as i raise my rifle and...\n\n*Click*......\n\nReloading, as it turns out, seems somewhat redundant when taking sniper fire in the middle of a field and what what was previously coming out of my mouth gets stuck on my throat and turns into a quiet squeal as I roll through the menu for my secondary. \n\nA makarov, the only gun in the world famous for being able to miss the side of a barn from the inside.\n\nSomehow my first shot takes him in the back of his head and he collapses as I empty the rest of the clip into the hillside. There's a moment of silence before \"ergs32 has died\" pops up in the chat and we both start cheering and laughing as adrenaline and endorphins rush through our bloodstreams. It takes me more than five minutes before I can bring myself together to loot the hackers ghillied' body.\n\nTurns out he had been going at us with a combination of satchel charges, grenades and 12 clips of AS50 rounds. We decide to take the high road on this one and hide the body with all its equipment before bloodbag-ing ourselves up and moving on.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. It was great fun remembering old times like this :)\n\nEdit: Grammar",

My Barb rages, and attempts a grapple on it.

I then performed anintimidate on the two remaining devils, and roll a 19(+23) and the dm gives an extra +10 due to the event that just occurred in front of them. The devils roll a 1 and a 2. Both have heart attacks, and instantly die. My raging barbarian makes sure they're dead with his handy dandy devil corpse.\n\nAll the while, he is taking damage from the devil's Barbed defense ability. He gives no shits and does around 80 damage to himself that battle. At the end of the clash, I only 250 left /s. ",

Dramatis Personae include Iorveth the Half-Elf Rogue, Davor Stormbreaker the magic-phobic barbarian, and Kirito the dual-wielding monk.\n\nIorveth the rogue has decided to visit a nearby forest to acquire some Spider-Venom to coat his darts in, so Stormbreaker and Kirito are free to wander the city of Paragon for a while. They encounter a mansion house that is in ruins, with the windows boarded up and clearly abandoned. But smoke is rising from the chimney, so Stormbreaker kicks the door in and the duo are confronted with NINE big orcs and a goblin, all wearing rags and rusty armour. The fire is going, someone has a keg of black, viscous grog that smells foul, and other small details that make it clear these orcs are squatting. They're all looking at the two newbies, and thanks to Kirito's timely sense motive check, wondering how they taste.\n\nThe orcs have no intention of letting the duo leave in case the City Watch are brought down on them, so Kirito senses an opportunity for some fun. He pipes up and declares \"I'll let you eat me - if one of you can beat me in an arm wrestle.\" \n\nDown the stairs emerges a seven-feet black orc with six-feet wide shoulders, a brass ring around the tusk protruding from his lower jaw. This is Colon, meanest and biggest of the bunch. Colon reaches the table and slams his elbow on the surface, as Kirito sits down to join him.\n\n(The way I staged the arm wrestle was a series of successive Str checks. Highest D20 + Str roll forced the arm down to forty-five degrees, and another successful roll won the bout.)\n\nKirito, bending his considerable strength to the task, forced Colon down to forty-five degrees before following up with a roll of 5. Kirito's clenched fist cracked the table as Colon slammed it down. Looking around the hungry orcs, Davor Stormbreaker grinned and piped up with \"Best of three?\"\n\nAnd so began the best knock-down brawl I've ever seen. Thanks to a series of wildly unlikely successful rolls, Kirito booted the table from under Colon and sent him flying into the wall. He proceeded to use Flurry of Blows to grab the nearest orc and Brooklyn Headbutt the guy out cold. Stormbreaker kneecapped the next one with the butt of his trident before being bear-hugged from behind. Crit passing his CMD check, Stormbreaker judo-threw the orc onto the groaning body of his compatriot. Most of the rest of the orcs failed a courage check apart from one brave soul who ran at Kirito and connected with a savage right hook (7 damage). Kirito responded by turning with the blow and spinning-hook-kicking the guy into the negatives. \n\nBefore they left, Kirito pulled a charisma check and brought two of the orcs with him as recruits to their cause. And as the players strolled out with their charges, they realised that halfway through, I changed the encounter music to \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" for the Tortuga-style brawl. And THAT is how you barfight.\n\nNinja edit: Clarity.",

In this particular campaign we have decided that instead of a bag of holding, our dwarven barbarian has a beard of holding.\n\nOn this particular day, two of our players were absent, both of which play Tieflings. My wizard is chaotic neutral and ever since contracting lycanthropy, the barbarian's alignment has shifted to chaotic evil so we both care little about how we do the job as long as it gets done. The lightbulb went off above my head and I got the perfect idea.\n\nThe barbarian pulled both Tieflings out from her beard and enlarged. We tied both Tieflings together and she held them in front of her and charged back into the boat, using both Tieflings as a human shield (demon shield?) stopping all of the pig's attacked.\n\nShe pushed it back against the side of the ship and with one nat 20 crit, trivialized the entire encounter. In between losing her shit from laughing so hard the DM award both of us xp and an inspiration point to me for, yet again, breaking one of her encounters.\n\nit's what I do.\n\n**edit:** according to the DM, the inspiration for this encounter was called \"we be goblins too\".",

        "text": "Alright, so today my players and I had our first session of a Warhammer 40k based adaptation of the Open d6 system that I whipped up to give the group something to do while another player sets up a campaign. The party were all Imperial Guardsmen, on the Inquisition transit ship *Event Horizon*, and I started it all by throwing them right in the middle of a Gellar Field malfunction during Warp travel.\n\nThere were three players, though one of them joined late, so for half the day the party was as follows:\n\n- Ven - A scout based off one of the characters from Gaunt's Ghosts\n\n- Jack - A demolitions expert who, at times, showed less intelligence and bravery than a grot.\n\nI allowed each character a piece of special equipment, Ven took a camo cloak, to aid with his stealth checks, while Jack took snare mines. Jack's player had flavored him like an American soldier in Vietnam, meaning he had dumped all his stat points in being a good shot with his autogun, really skilled with a combat knife, and enough know how about explosives to build simple frag grenades in his sleep. This meant that Jack's player was all too happy to request snare mines as his special equipment when he found out that they were essentially claymores. \n\nTo get the players moving along and actually progressing towards the plot objective, I did what every player expects...I threw some bulky enemies they couldn't honestly stand toe to toe with at them, namely a Chaos Space Marine boarding party with the mark of Khorne and flamers. \n\nThey make it to the shuttle bay that their Inquisitor ordered them to and everything looks like it is going to be sunshine, rainbows, and most definitely not daemonic possession or blood for the blood god, when Ven suddenly meets a traitor marine right outside the doors of the hanger. The plucky scout barely wins out on initiative and crosses the hall, into the hanger, at a dead sprint, screaming to the Inquisitor about heretics. A tactical retreat to the Thunderhawk was quickly ordered. \n\nI quickly rolled up stats for this marine and their Inquisitor, William Williamson, whom the party lovingly dubbed \"Billy the Fuck,\" and it turned out that the marine was a fucking tank of a man, heresy and all. His skills meant that he was going to hit almost without question every time he fired his plasma pistol and he was shaking off all the damage the party threw at him as he advanced on the Thunderhawk. \n\nThe Thunderhawk begins to prep for takeoff and I tell the players they have to survive 2 full rounds of combat before they can clear the hanger, allowing the ship to try to drop out of Warp and the engines to warm up on the shuttle. During the first of these two rounds, the marine shoots his plasma pistol at the Jack, who was closest to the back entrance. In his infinite wisdom, Jack thinks the best way to keep from getting shot is to throw your snare mines into the line of fire and hope to the Emperor that it hits one of them. It didn't, but we did roll for it. The two charges dropped heavily to the floor facing the Chaos Marine.\n\nAs the marine goes to take his second shot, the pistol \"Get's Hot\" (Meaning he crit failed the attack) and begins to vent the cartridge, dealing 1d6 damage per round until it stops or he can repair it. The players don't do much more than try to make themselves as scarce as possible and hope that they weren't the next target. The plasma pistol continued to vent onto the heretic's arm, dealing another 1d6 of unresisted damage. In a moment of ingenuity, the marine attempts to chuck the deadly weapon into the ship, in the hopes that the plasma will  \ndestroy all of his enemies within the transport. Of course he fails the strength check. The weapon arcs through the air and drops, directly onto one of Jack's mine, shattering the cartridge and weapon, the directional blast sending a hot wave of plasma back at the heretic.\n\nBy the time they cleared the hanger in the Thunderhawk, his plasma pistol and its various bits and pieces had managed to almost kill this god level npc that they shouldn't even have been able to hurt at this point.\n\nThe players aren't my enemy when I DM, the dice are...\n\n(Edit: Sorry for any typos, I'm writing this up right before bed, I'll fix them as I notice them)",

        "text": "**Author's Note**: Before I begin with the story, I feel like everyone needs a bit of information before I start with my tale. It will be a long text post, and not a collection of images. Pokémon UltraViolet is not a main series game, but a hack of Pokémon FireRed. It adds in all 386 Pokémon from Gen 3, as well as several new areas. There are a few other modifications (such as the option to catch your first pokemon instead of choosing one of the starters), but it is largely the same game that everyone knows and loves.\n\n**The Prologue**\n\nEvery day I wake up and realize that I am still trapped in my home town. The trainers who once lived here and kept the wild pokemon at bay have all gone off to become legends, leaving the rest of us trapped once the grass grew too high to see the pokemon. Every few days Professor Oak goes to Viridian City to get some supplies, but now not even he can pass through it. You're probably wondering who I am now, and why my journal is here. My name is Grey, and I am Pallet Town's last hope.\n\nEarlier this morning I decided that I had to make a break for it and try to make it through the short forest path without getting killed by the wild pokemon. Fortunately, Professor Oak stopped me before I tried it. After seeing that I was willing to die to help everyone, he asked me to come to his lab. After a few seconds of consideration, I followed him to his lab and had to listen as my neighbor whined about not having a pokemon. He likes to think of himself as being \"Blue 2.0\" because he lives in the house that once belonged to Blue. He even goes so far as to act like Professor Oak is his grandfather.\n\nAfter listening to him for a few minutes, Professor Oak finally relents and agrees to give him a pokemon later. He wanted to give me one first so I could contact Viridian City and ask them for help clearing the path. He gave me the standard starter choices that he once gave to Red and Blue, but I wanted something different. I asked him if there was another option. Luckily, he access to a secret research facility full of relatively powerful pokemon.\n\nIt was at that research facility that I met the pokemon that would become my partner. I actually would have passed over her, but she had a unique ability: she could speak telepathically into my mind. This was odd because as far as I knew, Trapinch was a ground type. That ability has come in handy a few times, but at times it could be a little annoying.\n\nOnce I caught her, I named her Imoen, after a character in a game that I had been playing. I could tell by looking at her that she would be annoying early on, but that she would eventually be extremely useful. After verifying that Imoen was the pokemon I wanted, Professor Oak led me back to his lab. It was there that I would have my first pokemon battle.\n\n**Author's Note**: This was my first story here, so any and all feedback is appreciated. What do I need to fix? What do I need to work on? Is it enjoyable, or is it boring? All of these questions are bouncing around in my head.",

        "text": "I am in a party going through the Rise of the Runelords adventure path using Pathfinder. Our party consists of me, a Paladin of Desna (DM let me be a chaotic good paladin if I sacrificed Detect Evil), a Wapriest/Slayer cross class dps machine, a dragon disciple battle bard and an actor bard who inspires us all to victory with rousing speeches and totally is the reason we win all the fights and completely deserves all the credit (how you gunna argue with all that charisma). We are all level 6 at this point, with 2 mythic tiers.\n\nAfter arriving in the city Magnimar and doing some faffing about talking to people and progressing with the plot, our GM informs us that the local arena is hosting a competition, with a large prize to be gained. All we would have to do is last a minute in a fight with a hydra. Hey, we could do this easy we all thought, and we need money desperately. So, off we trot down to the arena, and one of our bards manages to talk the manager into getting us prime billing, thats where all the money is after all. \n\nAfter a small amount of time, we are led into the arena, where across a large open space are 2 rather large gates. Turns out we would be fighting not one, but two Hydras. Luckily we had some time to prepare while the crowd got excited. I imbued my sword with the glory of Desna (gotta love that keen crit range), and our warpriest started buffing himself. Our bards meanwhile used their ludicrously high charisma to get the crowd ready for the awesomeness which was about to happen. \n\nSuddenly, the two gates across from us opened, and two 6 headed hydras thundered out heads writhing and spewing fire (yes, fire hydras). Initiative was rolled, I went first (thanks to my mythic sword ability that lets me add +20 to an initiative roll twice a day). I charged one of the hydras slicing into it and dealing a sizable amount of damage, nothing too fancy mind you. Next up came the warpriest. He also charged, and with his greatsword began to do his ludicrous amounts of damage. By expending a couple uses of mythic power to gain some extra attacks, plus a helpful sudden block from me to stop the hydra's attack of opportunity meant that he dealt considerably more damage than me. In fact, he dealt so much damage that he ended up cutting the hydra in half and emerging on the other side. The hydra would have been next, but it was too busy being in two separate halves and bleeding everywhere. Next came our battle bard, who moved into position to attack the second hydra. with a mixture of attacks from a longsword and his claws, which he had spontaneously sprouted, he cleaved a lot of wounds into the hydras flesh, causing it to roar dramatically in pain. Our actual bard came up next, and being a mythic marshal felt it was appropriate to give our warpriest another attack. He used this to deal enough damage to the second hydra to make it fall unconscious. Now it was the hydras turn. It was unconscious, but had fast healing, meaning this battle wasnt over yet. Initiative came around to me. Time for some dashing heroics. I began to charge, rolling an acrobatics check to dramatically leap into the air as I did so. Unfortunately I rolled a 2, but with a mythic surge I managed to get just enough to not faceplant the earth. so rather less dramitcally than I hoped, I stabbed the unconscious hydra, 12 seconds (2 rounds) after they had been released.\n\nThe crowd was understandably dumbstruck.\n\nOur bard, in what was a very extreme case of tempting fate, raised his sword to the crowd and called out \"ANOTHER,  A BETTER ONE\"\n\nAt this point our DM looked at us and with that evil look in his eye that all DM's possess said \"Okay then, another hydra. Oooh, how many tiers higher should this be? Whats that you say? Two full tiers higher? Of course! Have fun!\"\n\nWhile the arena managers began settting up for our next fight, we did some crowd work. After a few minutes, the doors at the other end of the arena opened again, this time a monstrous 12 headed miasma hydra emerged, and we all began shitting ourselves. Time for initiative. I get my +20 for the last time today and go first. Unfortunately, Desna doesn't technically classify hydras as evil, so I still don't get a smite. I charge in, roll not as well as before, this time I only get a 22 to hit. Unluckily for me, Miasma Hydras have a bit more AC than that, so even after wasting a mythic surge, I do nothing. Battle bard goes in now, claws the everloving shit out of the hydra, but alas it continues to be there. Next came the warpriest, who, you guessed it began to deal fucktons of damage. If I remember correctly, he made around 4 attacks, with a cold iron greatsword, which happens to be the only thing that bypasses a miasma hydra's DR. All of them hit, one of them crit. Later we figured out that he had done something like 120 damage in one round.  Miasma hydra's go. It lifts up its heads, and releases a, surprisingly, miasma of poisonous gas. Somehow, with our mythic power and my paladiny fortitude saves we pass enough to not instantly die, and just take some con damage instead. If the fight went on much longer, the turn by turn con damage would have ended us rather quickly. Our bard started reciting her speech, giving us all the desperatley needed +2's to everything. Now I go. This time I am more successful and mange to confirm a crit and i take a good chunk of health off. It looks very close to death. Wanting the killsteal very much, I expend mythic power to gain another attack, and proceed to miss it. Very sad. Battle bard, in a great show of respect, bows to our warpriest, shouting out his name to the crowd, because to be quite honest, he dealt pretty much all the damage to this thing. Battle bard then jumps up sticks the longsword between the hydras heads and it goes down. We all clamber on top of it, and the crowd goes wild. 3 hydras, 24 heads, 24 seconds of combat.\n\nEdit: My party has corrected some errors. All 4 of the warpriest's attacks did hit, and one of them crit, knocking the hydra back into a wall\n",

        "text": "Good evening Gametales. First time writer here (be gentle)\n\nAllow me to tell you the tale of Karros the besieged boss of the Clockwork Maze under the Emerald Spire (Warning: Spoilers for that module) and the 3 Pathfinders who dared venture in his domain for glory: Laucian, the egotistical half-elf bard (myself), Lunde, the human fighter with his beloved dwarven flail, and Renne, the half-elf Zen Archer with a bit of a mouth, and Kyra, the ever helpful healbot (NPC).\n\nThese three dared enter Karros' laboratory unprepared, as it was only the fourth room they had encountered that day. The Pathfinders exchanged a few meaningless words of threat with Karros before he cast Stinking Cloud rendering the majority of the Pathfinders useless in combat. This caused them to panic and flee from the chamber. Karros laughed to himself. \"Worthless weaklings...\" and called his construct minion back once the pests had retreated. He then returned to his work for a while before retiring with his guard to the throne room where he paced back and forth pondering new ways to keep such pests away.\n\nThe Pathfinders, however, decided to continue their intrusion into the floor. They took a different route hoping to find a better entrance to deal with the evil technomancer. They discovered his bathroom, which was rather opulent, before hearing a figure pacing in the room ahead. Laucian cast Heroism upon himself before kicking down the door to reveal... the Throne Room with Karros and his guard at the other end. Karros blasted the party with an Ice Storm, which unfortunately damaged his own minion allowing it to be quickly dispatched by the prepared Pathfinders' arrows. Karros realised there was no way to win... at least not here and cast invisibility and made for the back door. The Pathfinder floundered, throwing sand and powder in an attempt to find the wizard. He was spotted leaving, however, and was shot twice by Renne as he ran down the corridor. He cackled as he reached the door. \"ITS NOT OVER YET, PATHFINDERS\" he screamed as he cast a Fireball down the corridor, severely injuring most of the Pathfinders.\n\nKarros opened the door to a new room with another of his Clockwork Soldiers within and... a plan. The Pathfinders continued to chase him down the corridor as he retreated to his new guard. Laucian buffed himself once again to increase his speed. He had a plan, one that played right into Karros' hands. Once the rest of the Pathfinders entered the room Laucian ran in to meet Karros. The Clockwork Soldier pulled a lever causing iron bars to be slide up from the floor, blocking the Pathfinders from their cohort. Blows were exchanged and lightning bolts narrowly dodged and the Renne kept his aim true at the evil wizard. The gate was soon lifted via speedy use of a folding pole on the lever and the wizard and his soldier killed swiftly at Lunde's sword. Karros cursed them as he bled out. His plans foiled. His creations in the hands of...the Pathfinders.\n\nLunde looks up from his dice as the clockwork soldier falls. \"Did we just \"Benny Hill\" the boss?\"\n\nTL;DR  \nFound boss room early and were surprised. GM moved the boss to another room but we took out the guard too easily. He ran and we chased him through to one of his traps and triggered it exactly as intended. It was the most fun boss fight I've had in a while",

        "text": "*I didn't finish last time because it exceeded the word limit. Whoops. I didn't want to leave it unfinished or that would drive me crazy. Original post:* (http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2yxpk1/35_dd_mother_and_sun/)\n\nThe group continued to adventure after that. Yo'lun'ma, the Cleric of Pelor, admittedly felt a little better letting all those bottled feelings go after so many years. It was only made better by knowing she had the support of such a caring young man at her side. As for Faeron, he couldn't see her as the 2-dimensional smiling woman anymore. He realized she was more than just an elf that dispensed heals and words of praise, but rather a woman with feelings and desires of her own. He couldn't in his right mind just forget all of that, not after all of her patience and kindness. Whatever challenges the world had in store for them, they felt a little stronger facing them knowing they had each other in their corners.\n\nTheir second to last quest brought them out to sea in a tiny boat, which nearly crashed into what looked like an abandoned ship. They couldn't help but to board out of curiousity. The boat was filled with pirates (of course!) who were none too pleased to have these adventurers on board. They demanded they leave their goods and be gone. The group was having none of that and iniatives were rolled.\n\nYo'lun'ma had since taken up a second domain: travel. *So that I might spread the light of Pelor even more.* She had several new spells prepared she was eager to try with Faeron. \n\nOn the deck, the three pirates were ready with their own tricks. One of them including a gaseous cloud of pure nausea, where Faeron was unfortunately right in the middle. His eyes watered as he heaved and gagged in the gas. Yo'lun'ma gasped, then opened her palm in his direction: \"Don't worry, dearie, I'll get you out in a jiffy! Try this!\"\n\nWith a motion of her hands the sickly Faeron became airborne. If he wasn't feeling sick before, he certainly was then. He was floating through the air, flailing his rapier and arms and spinning like a drunk Peter Pan. \n\nAs he left the gaseous cloud and got used to his air-legs, he caught someone in the corner of his eye in the crow's nest casting spells down below. Aha! A chance to take advantage of this flight! He could go up, push him out, and that'd be the end of it. At least that's what he'd hoped for. Faeron plunged upwards to the crow's nest, pushed the pirate out...but there was no falling involved. In fact, the pirate was darting around the air as nimbly as a bird. Damn wizard pirate prepared 'fly', too! \n\nThe pirate cast a spell that sent Faeron careening to the deck, landing in the midst of the fight down below. He then became part of the fight as he was quickly grabbed by the ship's Captain and used as a club against Sir Dameon in all of his full-plated glory. The force of the blow, as well as their location, was enough to send both Sir Dameon and Faeron sailing off the boat and splashing down below. \n\nAs Faeron emerged from the water, black hair soaked and pressed against his face, he spat out the salty water, \"Did he just use me as a club? ...I'm not even mad, that's impressive!\"\n\nThe group met back on the deck to find the pirates had left. This was the perfect time to go exploring the ship. They investigated every nook and cranny until they got to the very bottom: a hallway with four doors. One door in specific was locked, which perked Faeron's interest. He had grown, too, taking interest in taking the quieter route (he was cross-classing rogue). He was just itching to try out his new lockpicks.\n\nHe tumbled the locks and picked away until, clang!, the door came to a creaky open. Faeron bobbed his head in, his body soon followed suite, and he came face-to-face with a horse-sized African Gray parrot. The parrot looked at him with wide eyes, blank, and sqwuaked in a horrible, raspy voice: \"**GRAWW! YER BOOTYS MINE, PRETTY BOY, GRAWW!**\"\n\nFaeron bolted out of the room and slammed the door behind him, holding the door shut with his own hyper-ventilating self. There was a wild banging and scratching against the door, joined with more ranting from the parrot. The entire group pressed themselves against the door to keep it shut.\n\nYo'lun'ma scurried off to one of the other rooms, in hopes of finding a way to stop this parrot and all of this nonsense. In the room was an elven pirate; she hadn't seen him on the ship before. The raspy obscenities from the parrot and the loud clatter from the hall seemed to fade away. \n\n\"Excuse me-\" she began, politely as always. He jumped in alarm, facing her and had his hand quickly on his scabbard. But he never once moved it. The look of panic melted to one of curiousity. \"No, no! I'm not here to fight. (\"**GRAH!! HEEERE'S JOHNNY!**\" the parrot belched as his head burst through the wall) I wanted to talk things out. This is one big misunderstanding.\"\n\nThe pirate slowly released his grip and nodded. As Yo'lun'ma began to explain their situation (You crashed into our boat, we were hoping to exchange numbers) Faeron burst into the room, \"Yo'lun'ma, there's a giant parrot and---LOOK OUT!\"\n\nFaeron's eyes locked on the pirate as he drew his rapier, flinging himself into an attack. Yo'lun'ma stood her ground, grabbed at Faeron's arm and stopped him. \n\n\"Faeron, no! Stop it! We were talking it out!\" she hissed, giving him a firm, but harmless, smack on the hand. She then turned to the pirate, who was not amused by the almost-attack, \"I'm sorry about that. We've experienced so much we're a little on edge. Especially poor Faeron; he's just a bit protective.\"\n\n\"I certainly don't blame him,\" the pirate replied with a warm smirk that turned Yo'lun'ma to a bright shade of pink.\n\nFaeron rolled his eyes to the side and groaned. He tried to save her from an ass-hungry parrot and here she making googly eyes with a pirate. How wonderful. \n\n\"May I speak with your captain?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Well...\" the pirate thought slowly, but then nodded as his face began to morph and contort until it was that of the captain's they saw earlier. Yo'lun'ma gave a small exclamation as Faeron's eyes returned to the two as the pirate was transforming. His eyes bugged from their sockets as he shouted: \"HE'S A CHANGELING! GET AWAY FROM HIM (Faeron had a paranoid fear of dopplegangers and changelings)\"\n\n\"Faeron, stop it, you're being rude!\" Yo'lun'ma scolded. Faeron protested but was not going to be heard; he was promptly told to go wait in the hallway if he was going to continue acting up. \n\n\"What? I'm a grown man, you can't just-\" \"Hallway. *Now*.\" \"....Yes ma'am...*Rack'm'frack'm'schak'm*...\"\n\nThey had talked it out and within minutes, the screeching parrot thrashing at the door had vanished in thin air (the DM's favorite illusion so far). The group and the pirates all met on the deck and the air was cleared. The pirates were just three changlings that traveled the world and scared people away so they could take their things. No one had excepted anyone to actually come aboard. As an act of peace and goodwill, Yo'lun'ma cast another spell she had prepared that she had been dying to try: Hero's Feast.\n\nThe pirates and the adventurers made merry as they dined. Yo'lun'ma spent her time sitting next to the Captain, talking, giggling, exchanging stories and pleasantries. Faeron sat next to the captain's other side, his face contorted to the best grin he could possibly forge, sword unsheathed under the table. Just in case.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Time for another story from Night City featuring good ol Doc Needles.\n\nBack when we started, we decided early on to make friends with night city pd. Lobos could use a bit of help after the base we were at was destroyed. So, back to the present, the chief of police calls us up about a Vampire.  Some one  had been going around draining the blood completely from their victims. Only 3 bodies have turned up, but one of them is a corporate goon who had high connections with the CEO. So doc and the new pc, ptich, head off to find what the hell is going on. First stop is the police department. We get there and Amy, the chief, opens a maintenance door for us to go to the morgue where the bodies are. Sure enough, bloods been drained cleaned of them. Something wasn't right in Night City...\n\nI then took out a medical scanner and scanned the three individual bodies. Nothing out of the, wait a minute... foreign body? In the arm? I take out a scalpel and find the scar.... small under the shoulder... and then I found it. A small hull for the latest augments... a nanite storage hull linked to the arm. Drained with the blood. Sure enough, all three have had the nanite surgery. This as both a player and the charact, made me nervous, as it was the thing that linked the poor bastards together, and my character had almost all of the augs. They all had nanoaugments. Then, we found out that hey, two of these people worked for a motor company.... so we looked up if there was a car show. There was one at the corpzone.\n\nNow a joke by the group is that Doc looks alot like Steven Steagall, being a 6'5\" native American (Lakota) with a rather muscular build (8 body) and blandish looks (appearance 5). Why is this important? Well, we had to get into the convention and look for more clues. Guess who was at the convention, and guess who lost his ticket and was left in the garage behind a van. Poor bastard didn't stand a chance between an angry russian and a doctor. So... in we went. Cars were everywhere, McLarens, Ford, Dodge, GM, Mitsubishi, you name it. Also, there was a nanotechnology group selling augments. Doc walked down to the group and flashed a few of his augs and was called up to show off ALL of them, so let's do it!\n\nSoon after we booked it out to the garage. Soon afterwards, right as we get to the truck we were in I get pegged with an electrostun round to the leg, sending Doc to the floor as my assailant attacked! Ptich started fighting him, shooting him with a shotgun before he fled the scene. The bastard left behind his car where we found the tool he used to drain his vics and we found out he used to be a ceo for a company the filed for bankruptcy. We returned to the scene and followed the blood trail. This led to the lair, where we ended up returning the favor to him. Turns out he had the same augs as everyone he took the blood from, cannibalizing them for their nanites. He currently has 5 life sentences of brain dance and the corps personally thanked us for our speedy capture.\n\nAnd doc quietly returned home, with plans to attend the auctions of neurotronix, one more building block of his medical corp.",

        "text": "Sup /r/gametales. Today's story is about a session I just played, with a completely new character in a class i've never played in before. He's an [artificier](https://sites.google.com/site/eberronpathfinder/conversion-info/classes/artificer) named Ezzie, who's upbeat, cheerful, and also has no legs.\n\nPlaying an artificier is odd. Almost all of their power comes from preperation and planning, as well as the obvious creation of magical items thing. As he was a new character, he didn't start with much- some armor, a wand of cure minor wounds, a wand of magic missile, and a [Ring of the Ram](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/rings/ring-of-the-ram). The rest was up to his meagre spellcasting- very little of it was geared towards dealing damage, and most of the things that were regarded constructs exclusively.\n\nWhich is why it's so impressive that they can cause so much CHAOS. During one part of the session, we had to stop a mad alchemist from breaking into an old crypt, and Ezzie had the forethought to prepare something special- a [Blast Rod](https://sites.google.com/site/eberronpathfinder/conversion-info/magic/spells/a-c/blast-rod). All he needed was to get into range, so he asked the party fighter to kindly give him a lift.\n\nThe fighter got a nat 20 on the strength check.\n\nEzzie, now traveling significantly faster than he had ever done before in his life, cannoned toward the rogue alchemist, rod outstretched. For good measure, he also triggered as many charges as he could from his Ring of the Ram. The attack roll for the rod was a hit. The attack roll for the ring was a critical failure, and the use of too many charges detonated it on his hand.\n\n&gt; DM: Roll 20d8 damage.",

        "text": "Despite losing one member of their party, the National Guard and Marines that crashed in Disney World gained a new party member and rescued one civilian. In the process, they gained a mobile command center, nicknamed the Mighty Duck.\n\nTaking this behemoth down the roadways makes it easy to shove cars out of the way, while Sparks is already working on a cow-catcher design for the front of the Duck.\n\nTheir course takes them from Blizzard Beach to the Wide World of Sports. And this is where Sparks decided to get creative. His first stop, after clearing out ten zombies, is a restaurant, where he gathers up all the high-proof alcohol and a barbecue lighter\n\nNext, after an unfortunate encounter with a Boomer summoned a horde of fifty zombies, Sparks entered the tennis court, salvaging a tennis ball launcher.\n\nThe rest of the team was working towards a signal in one of the safe houses here. A radio beacon brought two of the team, \"Moonie\" and \"Mack\" to the place underneath the hotel. The two survivors there were all too glad to get out of there, and promptly gave the party better weapons, first aid kits and supplies.\n\nSooraya and Sparks had been traveling through the upper floors of the hotel, trying to find anything salvageable. Sparks managed to find a few laptop computers and some signal boosters for Wifi. His grin caught Sooraya off guard, but she still asked \"What's with that smile, Sparks?\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll see. Let's get back to the Duck. I'm going to need some help.\" Sparks told the princess as he scooped up all the tech.\n\nMoonie and Mack having brought the survivors back to the Duck, were curious as to why Sparks would salvage this junk. He responded \"Just wait and see.\"\n\nWaiting and seeing was not an option for the party, however, as they heard a loud roar coming from swimming pool. Emerging from that area was a Tank, but not just any Tank. This monstrous infected was wearing the now tattered mascot costume of Buzz Lightyear.\n\n\"Kite that bastard for me!\" Sparks shouted as his player started rolling for jury-rigging his salvaged gear into a usable weapon. His rolls were almost perfect, and soon, with Buzz getting closer, he activated his weapon.\n\nThe tennis balls would be soaked in alcohol, fired from the tennis turret, and lit ablaze by the barbecue light. Though Moonie got smacked into a parked car by Buzz, the turret lit him on fire, to the point that as Buzz ran into a horde, the horde was also lit ablaze.\n\nAs the last of the screams died down, Mack made a sense roll to hear something different. Loud moaning, not of infection but of pain and desperation. It was coming from the other restaurant in the park. He and Sooraya went to check it out, and found something far more horrifying than the hordes.\n\nThere was a survivor there, his arms recently sliced open and an improvised explosive device strapped to his chest. He was bound to the inner door of the kitchen, serving as a \"Last Meal\" for any zombies that got too close. And the man responsible for it, still perfectly healthy, hissed at the party. \"Stay away from my trap, assholes! I'm going to get out of this alive!\"\n\nMoonie looks to the man who so callously used another human life and raises his gun. \"No, you won't.\" Two shots to the head. He then calls Sparks over to see if he can deactivate the bomb while he gets out a first aid kit.\n\nSparks, being the supergenius he is, manages to deactivate the bomb. Still shaken by what he's seen, he opts to take the bomb apart completely, and not salvage it.\n\nMoonie heals the victim, and the three of them bring him back to the Duck, where the other survivors offer him food and water.\n\n\"Ok guys, we've got a choice now. Epcot or Animal Kingdom?\" Mack says as he puts the Duck in gear.\n\n\"Do you really want to deal with infected zoo animals?\" Sooraya answers, sharpening her knives.\n\n\"Good point. Epcot it is.\" And they're off.\n\nStay Tuned for Dead Kingdom Part 3: International Infected, Taming the Beast, and a Cache of Chaos.",

Now I will tell how they lost it. \n\nAt this point, the party has gotten to enjoy a session or two of using Wilson the Minor Deity to check for traps and other unsavory tasks, and it has been working out pretty well. Now they're exploring the ruins of an ancient Dwarven city, abandoned two thousand years ago. Some scrubs show up, scubs get wrecked. Business as usual. The cleric rolls to loot, and just like last time, there was nothing on the body. Just like last time, he rolls anyway. Fucking 100.\n\nWell, shit. Once again, I had to free-ball some rare and exceedingly valuable loot. I made up something mostly on the spot, some ancient dwarven artifact attached to an obscure prophecy, utterly priceless. The cleric sees fit to entrust it to Wilson for safe keeping. A while later they stop to rest for a bit, and I quietly make a few rolls for Wilson while the party sleeps. When they awaken, the group discovers that Wilson has thrown the relic into an extremely deep ravine; he is bound to obey the letter of commands given to him and not directly harm his master, but beyond that he can do what he wants and is still hostile to the party.\n\nThe cleric is not pleased with this malicious obedience, so when a wandering patrol of golems rolls by, he sends Wilson to attack them. The low-level god fails to hit, and I roll for the golems. I roll a few times, then smile broadly. A golem smacks Wilson and sends him tumbling into the ravine, lost in the depths of the earth. I count this as a victory, rare when dealing with the shitbags in my group.",

        "text": "Hey guys, first post here. I thought I might share a story of something with you that happened a couple of months ago in a homebrew campaign I am GMing.\n\nA little background: the group consists of four players, but one of the guys, Loros, a martial arts-master, was not present during this whole adventure due to his player being in another country for several months. Anyway, the cast:\n\nSandro Santarra, black mage, hedonist and power hungy conman extraordinaire. He is a guy who can get nearly everyone to do whatever he wants and enjoys the good things in life. Still, he would like more. More money, more influence, more power. Usually he is a guy very unlikely to take any risks. Even though he is a decent fighter (fencer), he prefers to let others do the work for him. \n\nVestor Rothrak: Gold mage, master thief and assassin. A guy who mostly does not like authority (unless it is his own) and can be a surprisingly decent fellow - for an assassin. \n\nAregar \"Bloodsword\": Red mage, warrior champion and leader of a small mercenary company (only a few of his men were around in this adventure). \n\nThe whole thing is based upon a magic system I created (details here: http://redd.it/2sdrlr ). Yes, all the charcters are really high level. They are basically high level classes with added magic. Think crossclass sorceror with something else. \n\nAnyway, the tale itself: the PCs were working for the king of Kerenu. Kerenu's western part is civilized, with many rich cities. The eastern (far bigger) part is rolling grasslands inhabited by many nomadic tribes who swear fealty to the king. Now a brotherhood of shamans/holy men, the \"Shaduwar\", are creating an uprising. Several of the more powerful tribes are backing them, and the king wants to squash the rebellion. The PCs are among the mercenary mages who were hired to combat the Shaduwar's \"evil magic\". \n\nAn army of 12.000, the \"wolf legion\", was camping on the \"plains of Shul\" where the first king of Kerenu had conquered the tribes in a great battle 200 years ago. This legion was meant to provoke an attack from the tribes by any means necessary. The king's generals were certain that the tribesmen couldn't resist the insults forever and would be destroyed in pitched battle. What they didnt expect, however, is the fanaticism of the Shaduwar. They assembled an army of tribesmen and then 40 of them made a magical ritual (where about a dozen sacrificed themselves to add their own lifeforce to the mix) that destroyed the wolf legions camp in the middle of the night, killing thousands and scattering the rest. \n\nNow, the PCs had only (and unluckily for them, funnily enough I didnt expect them to be there at all) arrived in that camp a couple of hourse beforehand. They witnessed the ritual, the most powerful desplay of magic that this part of the world had witnessed for centuries, and survied with minor injuries (they managed to partially protect themselves with their own magic). Now I was expecting them to try to get out of there as quickly as possible. After all, what could they do? Their troops were shocked by the ritual and the destruction, most of the leaders dead, the camp torn apart, and thousands of tribesmen were closing in under cover of darkness. But no. \n\nSandro, the guy who doesnt like to take any risks, used his high charisma to rally about 300 men around himself and Aregar, even though they both didnt have any official power of command within the army. Then they decided to lead a charge of these brave 300 (yes, I know, that number seems to attract heroic madness) straight against the place where they new the ritual had been held. \n\nThey encountered less resistance than they expected (the Shaduwar used most of their forces for the attack, not expecting anyone to be crazy enough and come straight for them), but still had to fight their way through a group of several hundred elite warriors of the tribes (called the \"windborn\") and had to battle three dozen \"soul warriors\" (a type of near-undead creatures made with black magic, powered by the energy of human souls, nearly impossible to kill). And then they reached the ritual grounds...\n\nThey saw the dead Shaduwar that had sacrificed themselves and the 30 or so living shamans. Now a force of that many mages is a great power in this setting. They had maybe 20 men left with them at this stage. What does Vestor do, the cocky bastard? He challanges the Shaduwar leader, knowing that the guy is probably a much stronger mage than himself, to a duel. The guy (Vrasha \"pridekiller\") accepts. Vestor and Vrasha wound each other heavily, then the shaduwar decides to stop playing nicely and unleashes a pretty powerful deamon he had bound to an amulett. He commands the daemon to kill Vestor. So what does our young goldmage do? The sensible thing: he runs away, leading the big, lumbering mountain of muscle, horns and claws on a merry chase through the night. \n\nWhile this is happening Sandro and a couple of warriors have managed to sneak away into the tall grass undetected and are attempting to sneak up on a huge red magical stone which he felt had been the centre of the ritual. He jumps out of the grass and starts pounding on it with his dagger. The Shaduwar are not happy and send several to kill him. A grim battle ensues, with both sides killing and dying. \n\nIn the meantime Aregar charges the remaining 20 or so Shaduwar head - on. The soldiers with him follow him bravely. The Shaduwar unleash a crossfire of destructive magic and nearly wipe them out. But they are weakened now, and Aregar is among them, his sword cutting them down with ease. Still, they manage to throw so many spells at him that he cant stop all of them. Soon he is heavily wounded. \n\nVestor now comes back, after running a full circle, and jumps into the fray, the daemon still coming after him and running over several Shaduwar along the way, instantly killing them. Their leader, Vrasha, himself nearly dead and hidden somewhere in the grass, gives him a new objective: protect the stone. The daemon does so, scattering Shaduwar, Sandro and his followers alike. \n\nNow Vestor tries to find the enemy leader's hiding place. He spots him and is greated by a cone of flame that nearly kills him. With the last of his strength he throws a knife...critical hit! Vrasha instantly dies, the words of one last, powerful spell to wipe out his enemies dying on his lips with him. \n\nThat is when the PCs decide to retreat. All of them are near death, the Shaduwar are in disarray (and had lost about 30 of their number, which is nearly a third of all the Shaduwar in the whole land) and the daemon still stands over the stone, threatening to tear apart anyone who dares to approach. After a long track through the grasslands that nearly kills them, the PCs manage to get back to civilization and lick their wounds...\n\nThis was one of the most awesome (and closest) combat encounters I have ever had in my gaming career, doubly entertaining because it wasnt planned at all. I didnt expect the PCs to be there in the first place, and secondly I *for sure* didnt expect Sandro to take such a huge risk and actually lead an attack. He did, however, become a baron of Kerenu because of that, so it turned out well in the long run. Still, had the dice fallen a little bit differently, the whole thing could have been an easy total party kill. My players for talking about this battle for hours, we were all so pumped with adrenalin, you would have thought the whole combat had really happened. A great evening/night of gaming!  \n\nEDIT: here http://redd.it/2zkzi4 you can read more about the world where all this is happening. ",

        "text": "Hello! This is my first post, and it's not incredibly long, but I think you all will enjoy the read.\n\nSo, I had just started a new game with players who were new to the game. We were college roommates at the time so the tone of this game was rather silly and light, being that they had just started we weren't really ready for a serious game yet. \n\nOne day, while they party is sitting in the park enjoying a nice afternoon break in between quests, something terrible happens (no surprise there!) to many of the local animals: They are all overcome with an exceptionally magical desire to attack any and all humans around them.\n\nNow, as a quick aside, I should describe the layout of their current location. This park is on the edge of the town, and backed up to a rather low cliff leading to a river that connects to a nearby sea. The initial battle consists mostly of wolves and elk, but the players are having way too easy of a time. When one of them is knocked back off the cliff by an elk, clutching to the edge with both hands, it was revealed that a shark had also been affected by this spell and was waiting patiently below for the first unfortunate creature to fall off the edge. The cliff was just high enough that this shark couldn't devour the player, but low enough that it kept trying. The rest of the party decides to try their best to knock one of the few remaining animals over the edge to distract the shark. All of their attempts to help the player on the edge up failed, as they were being attacked by the animals. \n\nThe fighter decided to take this opportunity to get creative. (And remember, these guys just started, so i'm inclined to indulge their creativity regardless of realistic possibility) He tells me he is going to attempt to swing his grappling hook at a wolf, and once it was hooked he  wanted to do his best to swing it over the edge. \n\n\"This is no easy feat, you realize. These wolves aren't giant but are by no means small.\"\n\nhe rolls a 20. And so, shit, what am I to do? he spins his grappling hook over his head, whips it at the wolf, and it catches it right behind it's ribs. He rolls another strength check to see how far he can throw this thing, after all he has to get it spinning again to get any distance on it.\n\ni wish i could say he rolled another 20, but it was an 18. still more than enough to clear the edge of the cliff. The wolf goes flying over, he lets some of the rope go and lowers it to within the shark's purview. While he is doing all of this, the remaining players are occupying the remaining enemies' attention. The shark sees it's easier prey, and within seconds snaps the wolf (along with the grappling hook) up. \n\nThe fighter rushes to aid his friend up from the ledge, and that's how an off-the-cuff encounter that was designed simply to annoy the players and remind them they weren't invincible came to be the most talked about story among our group for months to come.\n\nThis isn't nearly as epic as some of the stories here, and i'm no expert storyteller, but I hope you guys enjoyed the read.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2yxpk1/35_dd_mother_and_sun/",
        "text": "In our older 3.5 campaign there was a decent sized cast of 5 main characters (if you're not counting the characters that were switched, ditched and just plain vanished). Each one was interesting in their own right, but none of them really had much of a dynamic with each other that they didn't have with everyone else. It's not a bad thing; they all got along and had quirks...But there were two characters that got along better than the rest of the group. They had a type of dynamic that I've never played before or since with another player. Lots of campaigns have brotherly -or sisterly- love among characters, and with good reason. It's, for the most part, young men and women traveling and bonding over great adventure. But the dynamic between mother and son is barely ever scratched upon, at least in my experiences. \n\nFirst, there was Faeron. Faeron was the son of a wealthy family and a colossal brat. His mother had died in his youth and his father died as a young man. So with no parents to tell him 'no', Faeron spent the family fortune frivolously on expensive wine, lavish parties, gambes of chance and loose women.  Unfortunately for him, he happened to get close to the wrong woman. He was soon framed for the murder of her husband, sentenced to death and at the last minute switched out with a look alike by his bodyguard. With barely a word, he was dumped in the middle of nowhere to live his life away from the world of luxury he knew so well. Faeron wandered the wilderness with the clothes on his back and his family's rapier his bodyguard managed to give him before leaving for good. Although he was declared 'dead', he made no secret that he was the real deal and how he was hungry for revenge.\n\nThen, there was Yo'lun'ma. She was an elven cleric of Pelor. She was a mother (which was obvious, considering she carried her infant son with her everywhere), as well as a widow. She didn't talk about herself much, so no one really knew anything about her husband or anything prior to being on the adventure with them (aside from her father raising mass hordes of bees). Still, she was as gentle and warm as a sunny afternoon. She was a healer by skill and by personality; she was the first one to be concerned if anyone seemed hurt or upset and was eager to help in whatever way she could. Healer aside, she generally enjoyed talking over a cup of tea and would always try to spin things in a positive direction. \n\nThe two had met on a caravan on the party's trip to the town of Jubilee. The group was attacked by bandits when Faeron had shown his acrobatic skills and fencing abilities. Still, he managed to get scraped and nicked. After the smoke cleared, Yo'lun'ma healed him and asked what a young boy was doing all by his lonesome out in the wilderness.\n\nIn her defense, she saw most everyone who wasn't an elf as a 'young boy' or 'young lady', despite their age. For Faeron, a half-elf about 20 or so years old, she couldn't help but seeing him almost as a child. \n\nWithout hesitation he sat down and boasted about his years of practice with the rapier and how his skills were unmatched. Yo'lun'ma politely listened to his bragging, although she couldn't help but to ask again \"But you're just a child! What are you doing out here?\". \n\nHe had given a salty glower and only a brief explanation of \"I have nowhere else to go\". \n\n\"Oh my. You poor dear, I'm so sorry,\" she replied, holding her fussing infant close. \n\n\"What about *him*?\" Faeron sneered, glancing down at Kolzhis, \"Not a very smart to bring a baby around bandit-infested forests, is it?\"\n\n\"I suppose not, no, but I haven't any other option,\" she chuckled. Before Faeron could ask another question, she turned to him with glimmering eyes, \"You should stay with us. It's much safer to travel in a group. By Pelor's light, I promise there won't be a scratch on you.\"\n\nFaeron paused, staring at the merry band of misfits. He couldn't help but shake his head and laugh, \"Not the craziest idea I've heard. Why not?\"\n\nFrom that point on, Faeron traveled along with the group (as well as the mysterious duskblade, Charna). Why not stay with these peasants? They certainly seemed to know a thing or two about living comfortably off copper pieces, a lifestyle he still grimaced at the thought of. She was certainly right; it would be safer to make company with a group (especially a group with a bonafide healer!) than to wander on his own. As for Yo'lun'ma, she beamed about helping the boy out. She looked down at her own infant son, cooing and gurgling in her arms, '*The poor dear is about as old as my son. ...They could have been play-fellows*'.\n\nOut of character, Faeron was played by a new player. He had a very firm idea of what he wanted his character to be as a person. But he was still not very set on mechanics and combat. I think that was actually a perfect fit for a character like Faeron because as the player learned how to fight, so did Faeron (who, again, was NOT a professional fighter!).\n\n After the group had encountered the bbeg and vowed to avenge his daughter, they decided to head north to the coast so they could sail to his island and defeat him. Through their travels, they had grown closer. Despite all of Faeron's grumbles and complaints, Yo'lun'ma gave a listening ear. When he got his clothes torn, she would gleefully repair them. If he got in a rumble, she'd patch him up and quickly use her thumb to get schmutz off his cheek. For Faeron, it was almost like home to have someone seemingly always willing to wait on him. Except she wasn't being paid to shower him with adoration and affection like so many of his servants were. It was a bit baffling. Still, he couldn't help but find a bit of comfort in it.\n\nThey had passed through Yo'lun'ma's hometown and wound up in an enchanted boutique (don't ask). In the end, it was filled with mannequin shape-shifters (we found out through Faeron kicking one out of frustration) that had turned into lions and were ready to fight. Sir Dameon, our paladin, ran head-on to fight them. Faeron thought it would be a good idea to follow suit. Faeron, however, was a willowy man with an average constitution and light armor. It was no surprise to anyone else when he got his ass kicked and booted across the room. Yo'lun'ma (who was even tinier than HIM) dragged his unconscious body away from the fight and did her usual healing.\n\nWhen all was said and done and the lions were left as stylish rugs, Faeron was back up on his feet and immediately greeted by Yo'lun'ma kneeling at his side. \n\n\"Oh, dear, are you feeling alright?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah, much better, actually,\" he replied, brushing himself off. She gestured him to come closer so she could get a better look at his face and promptly swatted him on the top of the head when he came closer. He clamped his head and barked, \"What was *that* for?!\"\n\n\"For being stupid!\" she snapped back authoritively, \"How could you just go barreling in all reckless like that? Do you know what those things could have done to you? You're not built like Sir Dameon, you can't just go running in all willy-nilly! You could have gotten seriously hurt! What would I have done if that happened?!\"\n\nNo one in the party had ever heard her get miffed, irked, mildly frustrated, surly, salty, cranky, fussy let alone *mad*. So everyone had to stop and stare at the usually merry Yo'lun'ma standing with her hands on her hips, finger wagging in Faeron's face as she mercilessly scolded him. Kolzhis began to wail from the noise, and she stopped only to coddle her infant, quickly sending a dirty look to Faeron: \"Now look what you've done. You made the baby cry.\"\n\nFaeron didn't argue back in his typical haughty manner, explaining how it was a cheap shot or how he totally could have handled that thing. Instead he sat and took it in. Lord knows how long it had been since anyone had truly scolded him, if ever at all. He clasped onto his locket, containing a picture of his late mother, and realized this woman really *cared* about him. \n\n\"...I'm sorry,\" Faeron said quietly.\n\n\"Oh, it's alright, dearie,\" she replied, still rocking her little one while flashing Faeron an exhausted, yet tender, smile, \"Just be more careful!\" \n\nFrom that point on, Faeron seemed to grow as a character into a more caring person. Especially towards Yo'lun'ma. He would spend downtime talking to her, spilling his guts and worries while she listened. Faeron would let her mend his clothes as usual, but no longer complained that it was a ruined piece of art. Faeron would ask how she was feeling, instead of constantly rattling about himself. He would let her have the last drop of tea! He even insisted on watching little Kolzhis while she got to sleep (something she hadn't gotten to do in 20 years!). \n\nIn battle, he got smarter. He no longer rushed head-first but instead would circle about and surprise the enemies. He became quite the fan of stealth and would opt to sneak whenever he could, but whenever it seemed like something or someone was getting too close to Yo'lun'ma and Kolzhis, he would be sprinting to defend. \n\nNot that Yo'lun'ma sat there and did nothing. In fact, during combat she became quite creative in how she helped (aside from casting a spiritual mace and healing). One trick she found was quite helpful for Faeron was 'walk on air', letting him run over the foes and quickly get to the back for flanking and shanking. \n\nIn one instant, Faeron was looking for traps and lo and behold! he found one. Right under his feet. A pit trap, to be exact. He screamed and braced for impact...then slowly opened his eye to see himself hovering over the spikes down below. His eye crept over to the party to see Yo'lun'ma waving and smiling at him. He, though still shooken up from near-death, couldn't help but smiling and waving back with a 'thank you'. 'Walk on air' was a big favorite of theirs.\n\nIn another moment, they were confronted by a horde of undead. Faeron immediately sprung into action, stepping in front of Yo'lun'ma...who quietly walked in front of him and into the horde without a word. Faeron cried out and began to run to her, only for Sir Dameon to hold his arm out in front of him. \n\n\"No. Let her go,\" he instructed assuredly.\n\n\"They'll rip'r apart!\" Faeron wailed.\n\n\"Just watch,\" Sir Dameon replied with an amused smile.\n\nYo'lun'ma opened her palms, letting down the fury of the sun (yes, there were a lot of 'praise the sun' jokes in this campaign) on the undead, leaving them a twitching pile of simmering zombies. She turned back as sweetly as ever and gesturing the group it was safe to continue. Faeron took a moment to find his jaw on the floor and scuttled behind them. (Turn undead is a fun spell). \n\nIn another moment, they were surrounded by dopplegangers (which happened to be Faeron's biggest fear), all in the form of Faeron. Yo'lun'ma had true sight and saw right them, running right to the real Faeron's side. The dopplegangers, instead of being murdered, were let go if they promised to stop their shit and Yo'lun'ma spent the rest of her time consoling a quivering, shaking mess of a swashbuckler. \n\nIn the pyramid of death, there were effects that took place. Each level the character had to roll a will roll. Each level was based off of the 'stages of grief' (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance). Knowing this, I decided to just fail the will rolls. The denial was interesting enough, but it wasn't until the second level that made it memorable. Upon entering the level of anger, she became surly and cruel with her words, lashing out on the party, particularly Faeron (things like a whiny mama's boy, a liar, lazy, a dandy,  claiming he just wanted her to heal him and nothing else). Of course this hurt Faeron, but she refused to talk about it. By the time depression rolled around, she was a slow, weeping mess who refused to move. Faeron would pull her along, even carry her, continue to urge her to keep moving on. She did no such thing, only murmering things like \"It's hopeless\" and \"I should have ended it years ago\". At the end of the dungeon, they were in a vast desert with nothing but a blue dragon. While the rest of the party fought on, she simply held Kolzhis to her chest and lay on the ground. As the fight continued, the party was getting weaker and weaker, but Yo'lun'ma paid no attention. It wasn't until Faeron, badly bruised and slightly fried from dragon's breath, begging for help that Yo'lun'ma snapped out of it. She then flew on the back of a giant bee (thanks, bee-dad!) and smacked the dragon in the face with her mace, taking out its final breath of life. \n\nFaeron couldn't get her words out of his head, though. What did she mean by 'end it'? Was she really planning on suicide? Choking down tears he wouldn't let her go until she came clean. She refused to talk, begging and pleaing to just drop it. He would do no such thing, not until he got a truthful answer. \n\nShe broke down and admitted that if she didn't have Kolzhis, she would have ended her life years ago. She broke down and told him, and the group, about how she always wanted to serve Pelor. How she fell for a young, brash sorcerer who stole her heart and convinced her to stop her studies. How the moment they were wed he became a colder man who kept her at arms' length and was always in his study. How she had to throw parties just to be in the same room as him. How he was drafted to fight and how he brought back a young human man on his arrival home. How this new man got all the affection and attention she was given and promised right in front of her very eyes. How this new man got to sleep in the same bedroom as her very husband. How their child was made not from passion and love, but from persistant tries with a cold vial. How they were sent to war again and sent back home in a box. How for 20 years she took care of their child who strangely never aged, how for 20 years she took care of her husband's now-crippled lover until the day he died, for 20 years she tried to continue where she left off in her studies and finally became the cleric she wanted to be. How for 20 years she dealt with in-laws calling her a gold-digging whore for not mourning their late son properly. How she buried her husband's lover in her intended burial plot and left home to find a cure for whatever strange curse was plaguing her son to prevent him from aging. How looking for a cure for her son was the only reason she was still alive.\n\nFaeron couldn't hold back tears. He could only embrace her and promise he would help find a cure for her son's strange curse, but he would not let her end her life. Not now, not ever. She promised nothing, but only wept into his shoulder. Yo'lun'ma could only internally reflect how much more love she felt now than she ever did in her entire life.\n\n\n*Not the most interesting story, and it's not even finished, but I just liked their dynamic and decided to share.*\n\n",

        "text": "I thought I'd make my first post to Gametales about the time my party managed to (accidentally) make a dangerous antagonist even more lethal\n\nSo, a little background to begin. The party has encountered this individual twice before, both times in which she managed to avoid death by disappearing with a loud pop before the fatal blow hit. After some research and deep thought by the two Tech-priests and a noble with some relavant knowledge, they managed to figure out that this individual had somehow managed to get their hands on a displacement field.\n\nThe party, upon realising this, decided they needed some way to deal with it. Our psyker picked up Haywire, and the plan was to cast it on her displacement field, and then gun her down.\n\nWhilst fleeing a bank robbery (a story for another day), the group got tailed by a hover-capable aircraft that was definately NOT with the local enforcement, so they decided to go down side alleys and try to lose it. Eventually the aircraft swept ahead of them and set down, forcing them to stop, and lo and behold who steps out but Miss Displacement field herself, totting an assault cannon with suspensers attached.\n\nThe party immediately mobbed her as the psyker cast Haywire, causing her field to malfunction. She took a headshot, field triggers, and something goes horribly, horribly wrong. She starts screaming, the warp presses close, and she disappears with a loud crack and a scream, a wave of corruption spreading from where she once stood.\n\nSo now the party is left with a powerful daemoness to deal with, one who seems to know intimate details about the party, and has demonstrated herself capable of appearing just about anywhere she pleases. \n\nOur noble born assassin believes strongly in redemption through service to the Emperor, and as such is determined to exorsize her of the daemon, whilst it appears the rest of the party are being far more pragmatic about it and are stocking up on sanctified weapons.\n\nMETA: This is my first post to Gametales, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve my writing style I will happily take criticism. Also, if there is enough interest in the exploits of this party I will write up their adventures, more or less, in full.",

        "text": "As has been noted in my previous posts, I play it fast and loose with the rules in my campaign. This approach leads to the kind of shit recounted herein, and I am okay with that.\n\nOn their way to the destination of some quest or another, I had my players encounter a party of orcs for shits and giggles. The players are very high levels, and the orcs were mostly just cannon fodder to kill time. The enemies are dispatched easily, and our goliath sorcerer rolls to loot. I tell him there's nothing on the bodies; they're orcs on the lowest rung of their societal ladder. He wants to roll anyway. I let him.\n\nI handle looting of bodies by having my players roll a D100 to determine the value of what they find. If there is nothing that valuable on the corpse, they just find nothing and can fucking deal with it. But if they roll between 95-100, I have to give them something immensely valuable that could, somehow, happen to be on the body no matter how illogical it may be. The sorcerer rolls a 96.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe sorcerer's player is getting pretty fucking pleased with himself, asks me what he finds. I flounder, trying to think what a fucking orc grunt could possibly have on his corpse of any value. Finally, I come up with something: orcs worship Grummsh, this one-eyed god of some shit. So their cleric-type shaman guys are called Eyes of Gruumsh, and they have a bunch of spooky powers. I decide on the spot that in my setting, these guys don't get these powers until they carve out one of their eyes and replace it with a small black orb, an Eye of Gruumsh. These orbs are extremely rare and, thus, extremely valuable to the orcs. The sorcerer finds one.\n\nI explain that the characters are able to infer that this grunt just so happened to have been transporting this Eye, recently created, from wherever it was made back to the village for the ceremony of their shaman's ascension. They all roll fairly poorly on Knowledge checks about the Eye, enough to know more or less what it is and that replacing one's eye with it grants orc shamans their powers, but not enough to know the specific process or what powers the Eye grants. I had hoped they'd just try to sell it to some scholar or ransom it back to the orcs, but no. That's not how these fuckers work.\n\nThey wanted to know what powers this thing grants. So they decided to go to this orc village and ask them. When they arrive, the orcs are all gathered in a central building in preparation for the shaman's ascension ceremony, awaiting the delivery of the Eye. I tell them that there are several dozen orcs in there, and even at their level it wouldn't be possible. The druid informs me that he has an AOE spell which has a wide enough radius to hit them all.\n\nFuck.\n\nGiven their low abilities scores, the orcs fail the collective check to resist the spell. Given their low health, they all fucking die. Every orc in the building, except for the Eye of Gruumsh-to-be shaman, drops dead. So the players stride in like cocky shitbags and ask this shaman about the properties of the Eye. Our barbarian tries to intimidate him and rolls poorly, so the shaman (displaying balls of steel despite seeing his entire village slaughtered in a matter of seconds) tries to attack. He is dispatched with relative ease, but the cleric still wants to know about this fucking Eye, so he rolls to cast Revivify and bring him back to life. Motherfucker gets a natural 20. Rolls to confirm critical success. Another fucking 20.\n\nAt this point I'm already annoyed with these fuckers derailing my plot, so I explain that he sure as shit brings that shaman back to life. He succeeds so tremendously that in doing so, he turns that shaman into a minor deity; immortal, invincible, and still hostile. He lacks any particular power though, as in my setting gods derive their strength from the faith of their worshipers. I figure the players will have to just restrain him somehow and walk away, and I get to teach them a lesson about deviating from the plot. Instead, the cleric tells me he would like to cast a spell called Planar Binding.\n\nFuck. Fuck. FUCK.\n\nThis spell has the power to bind a celestial or extraplanar being, temporarily, to the caster's will. I say that, given the long-ass casting time, there's no way he can get this newly minted god to stay still long enough to pull it off. Sorcerer casts fucking Polymorph. I check, and there's nothing in the rules saying it can't affect gods, and he rolls very high. Minor deity becomes divine tortoise, cleric rolls for his spell. Natural twenty. Rolls to confirm the critical success. I shit thee not, a natural fucking twenty.\n\nMy fucking face when. Chaos. Madness. The players are flipping shit. I am silent for a long time. Finally, I say, quietly and slowly, that the god has been permanently and irrevocably bound to the cleric's will, forever compelled to obey his commands to the letter. He then explains the properties of the Eye as instructed, including the fact that using it binds one's soul to Gruumsh, which turned them off to the idea of using it. Of course, now they have a fucking divine thrall to serve as damage sponge and pack mule, so this doesn't bother them too much. They name their new god Wilson and go their merry way. I did manage to take the damn thing away from them eventually, but that is another story.",

        "text": "For those who haven't played Mark of the Ninja yet, it's a side-scrolling stealth game about ninjas vs. guards and it's a lot of fun.\n\nWhere the story takes place, there are three ways possible entrances. The catwalk, where 2 guards were patrolling; the underground vents, that ended halfway to the exit; and the ground, where there were 2 guards and a dog.\n\nGoing in guns blazing isn't an option; I would get massacred instantly. Methodically killing would be tricky, as the guards would find the body and go into alert. Sneaking would be difficult as the guards had flashlights, there was little cover and the dog could sniff me out anyways.\n\nNow, there's a weapon in the game called the Hisomu Terror Dart. When a guard gets struck by it, he starts hallucinating and becomes jumpy, shooting at any sounds he hears and eventually killing himself. You can see where this is going.\n\nFrom a distance, I take aim and throw a dart at a ground-guard, then climb in the vents. The  guard becomes mad and starts shooting wildly ahead at his surprised teammate. When the dog smells me climbing through and barks for attention, the mad guard, who is seriously tripping out right now, shoots in the direction of the barking, killing the dog.\n\nNow at the end of the vents, I decide to bring the catwalk guards in on the fun. I take a normal dart and throw it at one of the patrolling catwalk guards, who shouts in pain. As expected, the mad guard aims up through the catwalks and unleashed panicked hell on the poor sap and his buddy who happened to walk into the line of fire.\n\nAnd finally, with all his teammates dead, the mad guard took his own life, and I emerged from the vents and carried on.",

        "text": "For those who haven't played Mark of the Ninja yet, it's a side-scrolling stealth game about ninjas vs. guards and it's a helluva lot of fun.\n\nWhere the story takes place, there are three ways possible entrances. The catwalk, where 2 guards were patrolling, the underground vents, that only reached halfway to the exit and the ground, where there were 2 guards and a dog.\n\nGoing in guns blazing isn't an option; I would get shredded instantly. Methodically killing would be tricky, as the guards would find the bodies and the dog would sniff me out. Sneaking would be difficult as there was a lack of hiding spots, the guards had flashlights, as well as the dog being able to find me from behind cover. \n\nThere's a weapon in the game called the Hisomu Terror Dart. When a guard gets struck by it, he starts hallucinating and becomes jumpy, shooting at any sounds he hears and eventually killing himself. This is by far my favorite weapon to play with.\n\nFrom a distance, I take aim and throw one of these darts at a ground-guard, then climb in the vents. The now mad guard starts shooting in front of him at his surprised teammate. When the dog smells me  climbing through and barks for attention, the mad guard, who is seriously tripping out right now, shoots the dog.\n\nNow at the end of the vents, I decide to bring the catwalk guards in on the fun. I take a normal bamboo dart and throw it at one of the patrolling catwalk guards, who shouts in pain. As expected, the mad guard aims up through the catwalks and unleashed panicked hell on the poor sap and his buddy who happened to walk into the line of fire.\n\nAnd finally, with all his teammates dead, the mad guard took his own life, and I emerged from the vents and carried on.",

        "text": "When this campaign started our DM assured us that 'Creativity and roleplay will be rewarded. Don't be afraid to think of non-violent solutions!'. To me that sounded like a dream; I love coming up with solutions besides 'I roll to hit thing'. So I remembered this tid-bit.\n\nThis campaign had changed characters a lot throughout time, but there were only two characters that came in the beginning and stayed until the very end: Yo'lun'ma, the cleric of Pelor, and Pup-Pup.\n\nIn the second or so session, the group was confronted by a pack of wolves. Specifically a dire wolf and a couple regular wolves. We rolled initiative and began our fight. They finally got to Yo'lun'ma, \"Yo'lun'ma, what do you do?\" \"I toss a stick and engage one of the wolves in a game of fetch.\"\n\nThe group laughs and the DM shakes his head, \"What? That won't work\".  \"My character's a pacifist, she's gonna try to play fetch. You *said* you'd reward creative thinking and roleplay.\" The DM sighed, remembering his words and let me throw my stick. He rolled for the wolf's intelligence, doubting this thing would fall for it.\n\nThe wolf rolled a 1 on Intelligence and goes barreling after the stick, returning with it in his jaws.\n\nThe group roars in a fit of laughter once more as 3/4s of the party are fighting angry wolves with snapping jaws...and the cleric is gleefully playing fetch with one.\n\nAs the fight went on, the DM continued to roll for intelligence for this wolf. 1, 2, 6, 1, and finally 19. The wolf seemed to snap out of his stick-stupor when he came back and saw his pack all dead. He dropped the stick and ran into the forest. That was the end of that.\n\nOr so we thought. As the group packed their things and began to head to the next town, we found a familiar wolf. Yo'lun'ma squealed in joy and, you guessed it, tossed a stick.\n\n\"Okay, no. No. There's no way this damn thing's falling for that AGAIN,\" the DM shook his head and rolled int. He rolled a 1. The DM laughed and hid head head in his hand, sighed, threw his hands in the air, \"...Y'know what? Fuck it. This thing is clearly too stupid to live on its own. It now follows you guys.\"\n\nSo Yo'lun'ma dubbed the new companion 'Pup-Pup'. Pup-Pup didn't fight in battles. No. Pup-Pup served a different purpose in life.\n\nPup-Pup didn't really get his shining moment of ~~pure raging stupidity~~ glory until the group (who for the most part became the solid cast for the remainder of the campaign) made it to the manor of Humperdink Chamberpot, a man dubbed 'The Master' and the official bbeg of the rest of the story. He was a rich man of wealthy taste, willingly paying great amounts of gold to our party to do his dirty work. The Master didn't care for our beloved party mascot, though. Upon first meeting Pup-Pup, he scowled and said \"Keep your hound in check.\"\n\n\"What does Pup-Pup do in response?\" I asked. Not sure why I asked, but I just had to know.\n\nThe DM hadn't prepared anything for this. He didn't think anyone would really care! Still, even though he was a new DM, he still had tricks up his sleeve: the d100. He rolled the d100 to determine how well Pup-Pup would succeed. Succeed what? Just life, really. \n\nHe rolled, yet again, a 1. Out of 100. \n\nSo in response, Pup-Pup became a sprinkler of all bodily fluids on this man's nice rug. Of course he got pissed and kicked our poor control-challenged wolf out of his house, but out of character we were rolling laughing. I admit, yes, it was juvenile. But just how this wolf could never catch a break in his rolls. It seemed like the thing was cursed to have the shittiest of rolls (and reactions). This was the defining moment in Pup-Pup's life. It only got ~~worse~~ better from there. \n\nFor the rest of the campaign, we would ask for 'what is Pup-Pup doing?', and the DM would roll right in front of this. So no, the DM was making nothing up. It seemed like Pup-Pup could only ever fail horribly or succeed epically. His rolls were baffling, and honestly, entertaining!\n\n* At one point in a fight, the player playing the swashbuckler had to leave and we needed an excuse for him to leave in character. The dice were rolled for Pup-Pup and he got a 5. So the excuse was that Pup-Pup had cast 'obscuring shits' and the poor dandy of a swashbuckler had gotten in the cross-fire. He spent the rest of the fight whimpering and crying in total shock.\n\n* Another player was out for a week and needed an excuse. Pup-Pup rolled a 17 and fart-rocketed itself and the duskblade miles away for the rest of the session.\n\n* We were curious about what sex Pup-Pup was, so we decided to check. 49 and under = female. 51 and over = male. Pup-Pup rolled a 50. It was impossible to tell just WHAT Pup-Pup was.\n\n* One week there was a great miscommunication and nobody could make it. So we rolled for Pup-Pup anyways....he rolled 100. In game, nobody did anything that day because every character decided to pet Pup-Pup.\n\nAfter that point, Pup-Pup kinda stopped being a colonically distressed wolf for our inner 5-year-olds and became something even stranger...His actions became weirder and weirder, and we can't say we didn't enjoy it.\n\n* Pup-Pup rolled 13 in the forest and 'glitched' through trees. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ELYI7QOEM ) Like that.\n\n* Pup-Pup rolled a 4, ran off a cliff. He then fell off Wil-E-Coyote style. (Yes he lived)\n\n* Upon entering the town of debautchery and hedonism, Pup-Pup rolled a 20 and apparently was one of the 'girls' working the streets, complete with fishnets. They then rolled a 97 and \"Gave one of the most immaculate wolf-jobs anyone had ever seen. \n\n* Pup-Pup had occassionally been spotted sideways, walking up trees.\n\n* Pup-Pup had turned itself into a mosiac just by blinking wrong.\n\n* During a war against a raging orc army, Pup-Pup rolled an 85. So Pup-Pup hang-glided over the fight. Pup-Pup was mildly a distraction to some of the orcs. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tQCNkFoMXM) Kinda like THAT. \n\n* Pup-Pup got lost in a snowwy tundra and wound up creating an army of its likeness. There was a snow-pup army. When the group had traveled to the desert, Pup-Pup and its army decided to wage war on Florida for no good reason. The army promptly melted and Pup-Pup came back to us.\n\n* On a pirate ship, Pup-Pup walked the plank and defied physics. He stood on the underside.\n\n* During a hero's feast, Pup-Pup hovered off the side of the boat and ate.\n\n* Pup-Pup was also the front of the ship for a little bit. \n\nPup-Pup became our bizzarre little mascot for pure insanity. One of the players, out of character, was convinced that he must be some god of Chaos in disguise. He didn't help, but he served to make us laugh by how strange he was. At least until the end.\n\nAs the group neared the end, getting closer to the bbeg, a horde of undead surrounded them. Pup-Pup sprung into action, fighting them off. As there was no time to lose, the group ran to the final room and left their faithful, if not random, companion behind. (As a sun cleric, I could have easily clobbered them...but she had her own agenda and wanted the bbeg **DEAD**).\n\nThe bbeg was beaten, the group was making their way back when they heard a dog's whimper. From the doors Pup-Pup emerged, limping and covered in blood. Yo'lun'ma cried out in anguish and ran to him, readying to heal him. Before she could, he licked her face and promptly died in her arms. \n\nThe group couldn't believe he was dead. I admit I was crying. Yes, he was stupid. He was random. He didn't really accomplish anything, but he was our Pup-Pup. \n\nYo'lun'ma then remembered she had diamond dust on her, and as a high level cleric, she could resurrect him from the dead. Oh, how she tried. (The DM at that point forgot that 'oh yeah, she had some of that, didn't she? Shit. ) It seemed Pup-Pup's spirit was enjoying being a spirit, floating through astral planes...he had even gone to the realm of Pelor and shat on his rug. How did we know? Pelor told her. \n\nShe was, however, promised if she took a part of Pup-Pup, when he was ready he would come back. Yo'lun'ma took his paw, buried the body...and even though the town was rebuilt and she focused her life on raising her son and living life as she wanted, she still has that paw on her mantle. Maybe he's waiting for that next adventure. ",

        "text": "  This is the story of Tirrup Hamble, the first character to die in my 5e campaign.\n \n  He was a simple person, a Halfling Bard, intimidated by the big world. His motivation was  simple, to make others happy and to atone for his past mistakes. When the characters stepped off the boat, he didn’t speak at first. He only found his voice in the tavern that night, giving one of the best performances the quiet little port will ever see. He also tried to jump from one table to another, drunk, he landed on his ass. He wasn’t the luckiest, his first encounter dropped him to zero health, against one panther, with the whole party. This luck continued, and in subsequent sessions he continued to fail, in the second session he performed what we now call “Hambling”, rerolling a nat 1 and getting another nat 1.  It wasn’t until we met an enigmatic character that Tirrup really shone in my eyes, both because the player called the character “Old Man Eyebrows”, due to the man’s prodigiously long eyebrows - they reached down to his toes - but also because with one spell he almost killed the party’s healer.\n\n  Selen, our party’s cleric, had gotten into melee with an owlbear. To “help”, Tirrup decided to use thunderwave. Due to the pushback on the spell, Selen’s arm was ripped clean out of the socket, only reattached thanks to a tribal healer.\n\n  Then came the recent session. The party had infiltrated a cave where Kobolds had been harassing some jungle elves from. On a mission from Old Man Eyebrows to find out for themselves what had been causing the disturbance, Tirrup finally found his feet. He was being useful in fights. Then, there was a dragon. It was a homebrew level, a step down from a young dragon, and it was thanks to Tirrup that the party wasn’t instantly mauled - green dragons love music and he gave a brilliant performance - but he also gave that one last piece of inspiration to our Cleric, allowing him to hit with Inflict Wounds, doing more than a 1/3rd of the Dragon’s HP in one attack. Even after being restrained he fought bravely, throwing insults, magical and mundane at the beast. Finally, it was his poor luck that betrayed him. He was caught in a wall of magical thorns, ripped to shreds by it. After the Cleric gave him his last rights Signa, the cleric’s patron goddess, came down to bring poor Tirrup to where the heroes of old slept. All that was left behind was a scroll with the last song he’d written and a golden, heart locket, in it was a picture; him, his sweetheart and his friend. \nRest in Piece Tirrup Hamble, the bravest small man I ever knew.\n",

        "text": "Characters  \n  \n&gt; We are all level 5  \n&gt;Droobo Hobbersnappertinkle - A 3ft Gnome Monk able to punch dragons 15ft  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Torvigg Burgadan - Our dual wielding fighter dwarf that crits left right and centre  \n&gt; \n&gt;Creighton Thorel - Our Rogue that has a rapier but is usually firing arrows from a distance  \n  \n&gt;Moriair Círchon - Me, the warlock that usually just hexes and eldritch blasts all the time  \n\n**So** as being part of a mercenary group we were tasked with clearing out an old cathedral that a group of paladins wanted to get back. Keep in mind that Moriair was out to make cash so this was the highest paying job we could find, it was going to be hard.  \n  \nWe set off for the cathedral, after a days journey with arrive smelling smoke and hearing the sounds of orcs. After clearing a couple orcs out with clever usage of still image to lure them away, and some nice rolls we entered the cathedral. We climbed through a window on the second floor.  \n  \nOnce we get to the window we see a group of cultists inside; by using the bell Creighton has and illusions Moriair creates we manage to dispatch the cultists easily. This however makes enough noise to encourage the orcs from downstairs to come up. A few dice rolls later the orcs are all dead and we're all pretty hurt.  \nWe decide to take a short rest so that we can explore the top floor. We encounter many different enemies including a black ooze creature and a floating skull. We also managed to find an immovable rod and a gemmed warhammer which our fighter immediately started to use.  \nWe finish exploring the top floor and decide to go down to the ground floor. Nothing is there as we already killed the orcs so we head to the basement.  \n  \n  **This is where it starts to get interesting**  \nAs we get to the basement we hear a variety of screams, Droobo, the good guy monk decides to rush to the door down a narrow hallway and open it. Inside there are 2 gibbering mouthers. We use clever kiting and never get into melee range and finish both of them with ease.  \nWe then have a long rest outside of the cathedral to get some health and spells back. Once we re-enter and go to the end of the hallway in the basement we see another creature, this is a fiend as we are informed and takes us all on nearly killing Moriair and Droobo (Luckily with 3 death saves and 2 failures). We press on! After encountering a ghost and a large red frog creature, which for some reason forces con saving throws on our melee's (I'll get to that later). We end up getting pretty beaten up and so we have a short rest, our DM tells us that we get all the benefits of a long rest **It is boss time**\n  \nThere is a huge double door in the room with a glyph of warding on, using eldritch blast the door finally explodes and no one is hurt, we see gold shining through the smoke and our greedy dwarf Torvigg rushes to the door. When he steps closer the gold is obscured by a figure and then the smoke clears...  \n**It's a mind flayer**  \n  \nWe all roll initiative after being told how doomed we are and luckily the mind flayer can't roll and ends up being last in the order. Creighton uses his turn wisely and sprints away as far as he can, out of the room, he's ready to leave us here to die. Fuck him.  \nOur fighter Torvigg doesn't have the same mentality, and as everyone knows dwarfs are stubborn, that in combination with a fighter he wasn't going anywhere. He rolls his 3 attacks and does some fairly decent damage.  \n  \nDroobo is up, his little gnome body runs over to the floating mind flayer and attempts an attack... he misses. He then expends a ki to do flurry of fists. He **crits** with one and misses the other. We are all pretty happy that he crit and so he proceeds to roll on the legendary crit table (which our DM runs where you roll a d100 and there is a random effect) **he rolls a 100**  \n  \n  Holy shit, he instantly kills the mind flayer.. with a punch... from a 3 ft gnome. We all fell about laughing as our DM puts his head on the table and just sighs.  \n  \nBest part is at least 2 of us would've died if the mind flayer ever got to attack (We played a few rounds as if the mind flayer didn't die so our DM could use his toy)  \n  \n**Back to the con saving throw** 3 months later we find out the con saving throw was because eggs were laid in Droobo's body and he  ends up dying because a baby red frog creature bursts out of him. The end!  \n  \nHere is a picture of droobo and his roll http://gyazo.com/8245aa0c8d8fda14084fc5d21b313636",

        "text": "So we were running a grimdark Monsters and Other Childish Things campaign. New York City had suddenly been invaded by demonic and angelic forces, and everyone had a red number above their heads that got smaller every day--what we assumed was a countdown to the apocalypse. \n\nIn order to survive, we had to intermingle with the demons--our \"monsters\"--to fight the much stronger beings that were now stalking NYC. The GM had gone all out in making each district of the city have scheduled events like riots and power outages, and he had a revolving set of NPCs that reacted realistically according to however we affected the city. I feel pretty bad that we broke the game so much that we never finished. \n\nOur PCs included a baseball player with a hero complex that shot bone projectiles from an exoskeleton and was completely overpowered in every stat (even before he started absorbing new powers from NPCs), a racist hillbilly that only stopped drinking to order his white-hood ghost monster to set black people on fire, a kid who gained complete control over kinetic energy and used his functionally invincible giant zombie-THING to cultivate a massive slave army, and me. My character, Braeden, was the party healer, with a friendly yellow blanket named Buddy as a monster. The only trouble was, Braeden was a closet sociopath. \n\nHe figured out how to use Buddy the Blanket to suffocate people, tear off limbs, drop people from high distances, repeatedly torture and heal victims, and turn a vortex of air into a blender for humans. Braeden made himself a costume out of a bloody robe and was busy building a cult, which he hoped to use to get enough supplies to survive the apocalypse. He had contingency plans to murder every one of his fellow party members that got in the way of his rise to power, and one time, as a joke, he ran over a crowd of civilians with an ambulance. \n\nOur GM kept pulling his hair out as we purposefully or accidentally killed plot-important NPC after NPC. We were the ultimate murder hobos, and we were getting more OP with every session. A small part of me secretly wished for some way to end the madness with a single over-the-top gesture, but I couldn't think of a surefire way to do that without assassinating everybody's characters. Then, the heavens granted a once-in-a-lifetime blessing. \n\nIt had been another long session of wreaking havoc in the apocalypse, and we were all split up. Bone-Projectile Guy had recruited a kid sidekick and a reporter girlfriend to complete the power fantasy, Racist Drunk Hillbilly had stolen an entire bar, Kinetic-Powered Mastermind had grown his zombified army into the dozens, and Braeden was shopping for a fabulous diamond-studded suit. Hey, just because you left your humanity behind in a bloodstained ambulance doesn't mean that you should forget looking snazzy. \n\nAnyway, he ran in to one of the NPCs that we had met before--a nice girl who was always losing her boyfriend to go fight monsters. This time, the boyfriend had really messed up and possibly gotten himself badly hurt. The girl was angry, confused and grieving, and needed a shoulder to cry on. I know you're probably thinking that I killed her, but in this case Braeden decided just to listen to her for a while. He missed pretending like he cared. \n\nThe DM took us into another room and the girl just ranted for a while. Building up a head of steam, screaming that there was no justice in the world, and that she would do anything to remake the world into the way she thought it should be. Just then the heavens opened up. God had heard her plea. The whole thing had been a setup for a new Big Bad to come to power, and I was going to be the one to witness it and tell the rest of the party so we had a chance to survive. The voice of God--also the voice of the DM--spake unto her: \"If you would have this power, the almighty power of justice, with all your heart, state thy name.\" \n\nThe girl opened her mouth, grateful and wondrous tears in her eyes. \n\n\"Braeden!\" \n\nThe girl looked at my character.\n\n\"Fuck,\" the heavens declared. \n\n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck.\"\n\nNext I heard several loud thumps. This was the DM pounding his head against the wall. \n\nThis continued for several more minutes. Then he began screaming into a pillow. \n\nTen full minutes later, the two of us exited the room, him completely silent with a red face, myself with a sheepish grin, with the character sheet for freaking Osiris in my possession.\n\nThe game ended not long afterward.

He at this point had grown bigger than most doorframes and was a huge mass of muscles. He worshipped the god of destruction and at that point used a chainsaw as a weapon. \n\n* Steve - Magic murder-hobo with a slice of kleptomaniac and extra dose of crazy.\n\n* Roxanne Chonite - Punk/Rockabilly Vampire slayer. Huge follower of the 'sex, drugs and rock'n'roll' lifestyle, but with vampire slaying. She widdled the head of her bass guitar to a stake and used it to kill vampires.\n\n* Ivan - He was only there for this one mission. We don't really know much about him other than he was insanely smart. And sane.\n\n* Sanji - Taxi drive ally. We acquired his alliance a couple sessions before. He learned to drive from watching every action movie ever made. He can show up in his taxi, once a day, at anywhere simply by calling \"Taxi!\".\n\nSo, the setting of this campaign was modern-fantasy. It took place in modern-day Chicago and the characters worked for a monster-hunting company. If there was anything monster/occult/folklore/etc. that went awry and started hurting people it was our job to hunt them down. Our group had been given their physicals and two bombshells were dropped with the best of bedside manner:\n\n\"Roxanne, you're pregnant. Seamus, you've got a monster egg in your brain and if it hatches your head will explode. ...Seeya.\"\n\nOf course that shook the great burly flesh-wall named Seamus. How did he get a brain egg?! None of that made sense. He didn't want to think too much about it, afraid he'd be able to feel it move in his head. Thankfully, there WAS a cure for brain eggs. It just required a special ingredient: an angel feather. Thankfully, they could be bought at the Vatican!\n\nSo the group packed their bags and made their way to the Vatican. It was the moment they landed that they split up.\n\nRoxanne and Seamus went off in one direction. Roxanne stayed close, moaning about her life being over and how Seamus might be the dad. It makes sense she'd talk to him about it; he, too, had a tiny living thing inside of him.\n\nSeamus, being as big as a house, covered in animal pelts, carrying around a bloody chainsaw and several swords was a sight to see to say the least. People screamed and ran. Seamus's reaction? \"OH. Is this the Italian version of the running of the bulls? WAIT UP! I WANNA JOIN IN!\"\n\nWhich made people run even more. The police were called and opened fire. Seamus went into a rage and fought back, revving dear Delilah the chainsaw into bloody action. Roxanne, being the resident punk, stole one of their cars and promptly crashed it into a building (I failed a 'drive' roll). The two ran off into the city, Seamus fighting the cops as Roxanne tried her best to evade (several bulletholes in her beehive).\n\nMeanwhile, Steve actually made it TO the Vatican. He made it inside, made his plea for his teammate who was dying of brain eggs and how they desperately needed an angel feather. The cardinal he was speaking to showed him pity and offered to sell him an angel feather at a discount price. For only $200, reasonable for a life-saving ingredient, and a price Steve had and definetly would have been reimbursed.\n\n Steve kicked the cardinal in the balls and stole the feather. \n\nHe didn't stop there, oh no. He made his way to the vault and made off with a handful of relics before he tore out of the Vatican with a fleet of cardinals chasing after him, brandishing rulers. \n\nMeanwhile, Ivan was souvenir shopping.\n\nThe group had met up on the streets of the Vatican in a mad pursuit. Roxanne, Seamus and Steve running as fast as they could from a swarm of police, cardinals and helicopters. Steve used his lightning magic to shoot down a helicopter which promptly crashed into a building full of innocents. Thanks, Steve!\n\nThey managed to get a hold of Ivan, quite literally grabbing him on the way, and tried to make it to the airport. \"TAXI!\"\n\nSo, they quickly piled into the taxi and made a mad dash towards the airport; Seamus's head sticking out the passenger window like a dog. Steve sitting out the other, shooting down more cardinals and cops. There was only one plane left, completely empty...\n\nSo they boarded it themselves, urging Ivan to fly it because he was so smart. Smart people fly planes, right? **RIGHT!?**\n\nFortunately in their case, smart people CAN fly planes (Ivan had rolled a critical success on his intelligence roll. Pretty damn lucky!), and he managed to get the plane smoothly flying towards home. They sighed with relief. Their bosses could easily wipe their records clean for that mishap, they always did. \n\nFlying the plane was the easy part, apparently. Landing it was not. Ivan, in his gloriousness, could fly a plane but couldn't fathom how to land it (Ivan had rolled a failure on his intelligence roll). That wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't making their way towards a mountain.\n\nSeamus, being the ever-ready team leader had the most brilliant idea in the world:\n\n* Seamus: Alright! I'm gonna slice this plane in half. Steve, you cast 'walk on air' and we'll walk down the air. \n\n* Roxanne: Uh, we have parachutes-\n\n * Seamus: (revving the chainsaw and slicing into the plane) NO TIME FOR LOGIC!!\n\n(Yes. This was the actual discussion)\n\nThe plane was sliced and Steve cast 'walk on air' on all of us. So the group jumped out of the plane...and they crashed on the air like concrete. It took a good deal of health from us. Seamus took it just fine, being the walking barrel of HP he was, but for everyone else? They were beginning to fade to unconciousness. If Steve wasn't awake, the spell would wear off, which would mean the group would become adventurer slushies. \n\nSo Seamus picked them all up on his arms (really working that strength roll of his), and making a mad dash down the air like a flight of stairs. They were still above the ground when Steve had finally failed his HP roll and knocked out, the spell vanishing immediately. \n\nIt was at this moment, there was a brief pause. Seamus was calculating some mild gravity physics in his head. From that fall, they were most likely to get hurt, possibly die or be paralyzed for life. Seamus would be fine, being pure strength alone, but the other three? He would take this moment now to save one by holding on to them and taking blow. He had three choices: \n\n* Ivan, who he had JUST met.\n\n* Steve, who had abandoned him several times for loot, sold him out several times, just had to kick the cardinal and steal more crap...\n\n* Roxanne, the hot chick (and maybe-baby-mama?) who was always dtf\n\nSo he puts Roxanne in his arms and braces for impact. The group barrels towards the ground and hits with a great **THUD**. Steve and Ivan hit the ground like rag dolls, bruising and breaking almost every bone in their bodies. Seamus hits the ground like a missile and his right leg explodes on impact (that was a poor HT roll on his part), blood spraying all over the ground, bones cracking like tortilla chips. He groans and screams in agony, trying to stand up on his one leg and hold the fading Roxanne. \n\nShe weakly hands him her bass to use as a crutch as she tiredly bleats: \"I don't care what the results are...you're the dad.\"\n\n\"I know.\" he replies as she knocks out in his arms. \n\nHe grits his teeth, breathing heavily and trying to stay conscious with all the pouring blood from what was once a leg. Seamus gently drops Roxanne from his arms and clutches onto her bass guitar. In the distance the smoke from the crashed plane hovers in the distance. The four of them are surrounded by empty, empty field. \n\nWith his last awake moment, he grunts, winces and slowly raises his finger in the air: \"**TAXI!!**\"\n\n\n*Everyone survived that stupid adventure. Everyone got fixed, Seamus got rid of his brain egg and grew a new leg with magic. No one got arrested...although we were permanently on the Pope's shit list from that point on. Too bad we forgot about that...*\n\n",

        "text": "*So this is a bit of a continuation of ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2yi8h9/o_renaldo_werefore_art_thou/ ), expanding on the bizarre story of the relationship between the goodlyl Paladin and the shifty madame of a brothel. So, as a warning, this story gets mildly saucy.*\n\nAs previously mentioned, the group had come into contact with a woman known simply as \"The Madame\".  She ran the brotel, as well as the entire town, of Avail. The Madame was a business woman through and through; she didn't really seem to care how badly her practices sullied her moral compass. She aimed to please the masses, so she made sure she had something in that house for whatever taste, no matter how depraved it was. Hell, that was her selling point. \n\nThe duskblade didn't bat an eye at the lewd displays or foul character. The swashbuckler closed his eyes and kept reminding himself of his recent vow of chastity. The goodly cleric, while not condoning the selling of sex, couldn't help but taking in a few peeks at the strapping gentlemen of the manor.\n\nThe most offended, however, was the always righteous paladin, Sir Dameon. *How could she sell such innocent people in a decadent, hedonistic manner? Oh. They chose to work here? AND you provide weekly visits to a healer? ...I still stand by my mistrust.*\n\nThe Madame's reaction to him was much more accepting. She saw him in his armor and immediately tried to hire him as a new man-whore. She thought his armor was part of a gimmick. *It's brilliant, shug. Do you know how many women fantasize about being saved'n'fucked by a knight in shining armor? I'm amazed I hadn' thought of it m'self.*\n\n**\"It's no gimmick, I'm a Paladin of the flaming hearts. I'm pure, body and soul. I have never worn this armor to seduce a woman, nor will I ever.\"**\n\nThe Madame took a moment before choking on smoke from laughing. From that moment on, the dynamic between the two was always that of polar opposites. The Madame, whenever he was around, would personally try to prove that no one was 'pure'. She would challenge his alignment, his faith, his role as a paladin, his ideals, morals...And he would face the challenge every time. \n\nI suppose why the rest of the group, out of character, was so okay with him always being tested like this (and seperating from the party occassionally, in the process) was because it was so much more interesting to watch. When Sir Dameon was facing a foe in combat, he was gallant, strong and brave. His answer was always the same: a swift swing of the sword. But when he was facing verbally against the Madame, there was a bit of a change. He seemed to lose a bit of the confidence. He didn't become a stammering mess or started second-guessing himself, but rather he would listen to her. He listened to every word she said, and he would pause. Sir Dameon would mull over the things she just said for a minute or two, thinking.about his answer. I personally found the debates more interesting than combat (and don't get me wrong. I like combat!), and I suppose the group found an interest in them too. It was actually kind of interesting to see a bit of humility and depth to this character, even if it was just because he had to sit and think of a response. Maybe that's just my thought, but it made him seem like a more level-headed and friendly person that he actually thought his answers through as opposed to \"NOPE. I'M RIGHT. I'M A PALADIN.\"\n\nIn one distinct moment, I remember the Madame had pulled Dameon away from the rest of the group once more. Instead of questioning why he did what he did or believed what he did, she began to talk about herself for once. Not about her business, but herself as a person. She asked if he knew the name of Bartholomew Agansheap. He did, that was one of the founding fathers of his order! \n\nShe had told him about Bartholomew being her father ('Father? That was hundreds of years ago!' 'I've been around, shug') and just how her parents had met. Her mother was a nymph living wildly in the woods, as they're prone to doing. Bartholomew was smitten by this pretty little fey and asked her to be his wife. She had no idea what that meant, so he captured her, made her his wife and forced her into converting and living his lifestyle. The Madame didn't bat an eye; she simply puffed her pipe and continued with basically \"Your order was built by a violent brute. How do you feel about your order *now*?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that happened. I really am. But that was him, not me. I follow the teachings and the morals of the orders, not the people. I am unshaken.\"\n\nThat left the Madame stunned. You could hear the tip of her pipe crack in her teeth. She let him go without a peep.\n\nAfter that was the most memorable moment to the entire group. She had once again called him into her office. The Madame had another challenge for him. She wanted to challenge will-power against our Paladin. \n\nShe was half-human half-nymph. So while she loved financial conquest, she was easily distracted by sins of the flesh. In her earlier days, she used that to her advantage, but she had always viewed it more as a handicap more than anything. So, the Madame always wore a pair of glasses that blurred her vision so she couldn't see people clearly and the feeling of lust would vanish. \n\nShe claimed there was no holy man alive she couldn't turn to putty just by loosening a few buttons. It was a game of 'show me yours, I'll show you mine' of good vs. evil (I think I need a drink just writing that line). He would show her some of him, and she would show herself back -no glasses-. \n\nSir Dameon initally declined her challenge, saying his faith wasn't going to be turned into a tawdry burlesque. \"If y'all were so pure, this wouldn't be a problem for you\". That was the line that convinced him to accept her challenge. And this is where it got stupid.\n\nArmor/clothes were discarded and the dice were rolled for will. Sir Dameon rolled a 9, but plus his will bonus he just barely made it out. He was red in the face, mouth agape, swallowing his own tongue. He only had one word on his mind: \"*Daaayum*\".\n\nThe Madame rolled a 1. \n\nCue the roars of laughter from the entire group, including the DM who was hiding his face in how stupid this had become. The Madame launched herself on Sir Dameon like a howler monkey in heat, trying to smother him in kisses and trying desperately to get everything below the belt off. Sir Dameon, while tempted and pleading \"This isn't right!\" searched furiously through the room with Madame humping on his back, trying to find her glasses and stop this madness. \n\nThere was a crunch under his feet and small shards of glass. *Oh, no*. The glasses! Fortunately, only one of the lenses was under his foot, its twin just barely meeting the same crushing fate. \n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party sat quietly outside her office, trying to make small talk to Renaldo. And failing. They paid no attention to the hoops and hollars coming from behind the wall, or at least didn't question it.\n\nHe gave her the glasses and declared \"I won your challenge!\". He gathered his armor and scuttled out of her office. \n\nThey didn't see each other for a long while after that. The recent quest was long and toiling. By the time they made it back, the Madame didn't greet them at all.  As marauders came in to attack the town, she showed up with a carriage. Not a word other than 'get in'. She gave them the boat they needed to get to the bbeg's island, as well as 2 letters. One addressed to the party, the other directly for Sir Dameon. She stayed behind as the town crackled in flames against the crashing waves of the sea. \n\nSir Dameon read his note. In a nutshell it said: \"Hey. Not sure if I'm going to live. But I trust you because you're the most genuine guy I've ever met. The daughter of the bbeg that was drained to an inch of her life (by said bbeg)? That's my daughter. I didn't raise her because I didn't want to give up my job and that'd be humiliating to be raised in a brothel. I'd be an awful mother. I thought it'd be better if he kept her. I'm super pissed at bbeg for it, that's why I've been helping. That and the end of the world is bad for business. Also, I've never met anyone as genuine and pure as you. It's a shame you didn't trust me and a shame with this whole 'end of the world' thing. You could have been the one to save me after all. I think for once in my life I actually feel affection.. Oh well.*' That's the abridged version, anyways.\n\nHe became very quiet after that and wouldn't talk to anyone about it. It was a sullen boat ride, anyways, so no one was feeling particularly chatty anyways.\n\nWeeks pass, the group made it to the island, defeat the bbeg and save the world. They make it back to the smoldering pile of ash that was once the crowned jewel of commercialism and debautchery was now nothing more than broken glass, burnt buildings and and smoke. But, alas, who happened to survive? The Madame -and Renaldo-, staring at the ruins of her precious legacy blowing away in the wind. How her eyes glistened when she saw Sir Dameon tromp up the hill victoriously. She ran towards him, threw her arms around his neck \"Oh, yer alive!\" and leaned in towards his face.\n\nSir Dameon looked down at the Madame, paused, shrugged \"...Yeah, I'll take it!\" and kissed her back. \n\nThey were married in the epilogue. It was a cute and definietly entertaining relationship, if not dysfunctional. \n",

        "text": "So, I started a gametales thread before about a game we called [Fireteam Blobfish](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2q77yj/only_war_fireteam_blobfish_prologue/). Sadly, GM decided to concentrate on his Dark Heresy and we gave it up. Well, we asked our friend ([This Guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2xis9n/only_war_how_my_first_attempt_at_gming_became/)) to start another game for us. Basically, it centres around a Insurgency on a Hive World with an Ork Population, PDF who are pretty incompetent and have access to abhumans, and some Hostile Wildlife we rolled up from the Rogue Trader books. World is called Carinthos and is basically pretty rad world he's created. The practice session went... Well as it did and the next session went just as well.\n\n****\n\nThe Team at the moment is;\n\n**Kai** - The team's Medic, Thief and Impromptu Commander . Was a Medical Student before joining the ULF for reasons related to the Inquisition. After an incident that killed his entire ward while he was off getting high, he started to try find out more about what happened. In doing so he attracted the attention of some of the acolytes still stationed on Carinthos, and after a failed attempt on Kai's life he ran to the nearest place of shelter in the capital hive's underhive. There, he slowly managed to gain contacts and fled to the ULF for safety. While still believing in the Emperor and not really sharing the same ideals as the ULF, he has no real loyalty to the Imperium and is only concerned with his own life. He has however become attached to his Squad, and will try to help them. Played by Myself.\n\n**Steelsight** - The team's 'I can't believe it's not Tech Priest'. A heretek from the Machine Cult of Mars, he joined the ULF as a Specialist. He has no Mechadendrites but has a Baleful eye instead. He is Kai's old Squad mate and is Kai's First Friend in the ULF. Is a coward however and will run from any fight that doesn't seem like the best bet for odds. Played by Lemon\n\n**Bob 'The Stone' Johnson** - The team's resident lifter and Heavy Weapons Guy. Basically is a massive Grimdark version of 'The Rock' who can intimidate just by flexing in people's general direction. He was 'liberated' from a Penal colony by the larger off world ULF forces, and stationed on Carithos because it was the closest to the planet. Played by Bear\n\n\n**KIWI** - The team's hobbit sniper and talker. A Ratling who is friendly, accurate and is filthy as fuck. Played by Fox\n\n**WillySniper** - The team's bigger sniper and close combat specialist. A human who is reckless, doesn't talk much, and blows people's heads up. A lot. Played by D53\n\n**Peg** - The Squig that Steelsight shot and then nursed back to health with Kai's assistance. Is basically a pet kept at base. Raises morale more than anything else.\n\n*Note: Character Backstories aren't finished, will edit when told, which is possibly next Monday*\n\n****\n\nSo the first session started where the Practice session ended, with Kai and Steelsight returning from outpost duty. They brought back Peg, and placed his cage inside their Barrack and reported to their usual CO, which was a Sergeant. The Sergeant was in the middle of training some newbies to the main ULF base on Carinthos, and turned to us with the usual Sergeant attitude of ",

        "text": "So let me start out with saying that while I really dislike incepting other users' ideas, there was one that greatly appealed to me and my players' gambling tastes, and that was [Luciel the Efreet](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2ud1u0/you_find_a_pair_of_smooth_obsidian_dice_inscribed/) (You MUST read this or skim over it before reading this story)\n\n\nSo my players found themselves in a predicament. After being run into an abyssal plane layer that looked relatively peaceful (infinite grassy plane with a single two-story building, which was a quest in itself), they managed to accidentally set fire to the grass, which very quickly spread. The layer's owner wasn't happy, so he extinguished the fire and made the players clean up the damage. Afterwards, since the portal back to their world was destroyed, he forced them to play a game to earn their freedom (he was a devil). He handed the drunkard the infamous black obsidian dice, and thus started our 3 hour session of stats adjusting and curse-giving.\n\n\nThis was a new experience for us. Everyone was enrapt by the games of simply rolling two dice, seeing the outcome, and watching their characters change and warp. The sorcerer lost almost all of her spells due to charisma loss, but gained enough dex and con to be a battle archer with the sorcerer class. The drunkard was mostly unaffected. But the tank, when he took a turn at the game, boy did his stats change. For anyone who didn't read the link, the goal is to roll snake-eyes, else you must keep playing. You can get great rewards, or horrible penalties. Generally, the game is more harmful than it is good, and virtually impossible to win. Vlad Tinpu the tank was the exception.\n\n\nAfter around an hour and a half of just him rolling and recording (which was surprisingly fun and we all loved somehow), he ended up with these stats.\n\n**Str 29**\n\n**Dex 21**\n\n**Con 20**\n \n**Int 6**\n\n**Wis 10**\n\n**Chr 16**\n\n (And a +60 professional wrestler, the skills gained through this had no cap to their limit)\n\n***As a level 7 half-orc***\n\n\nAnyway, even though he had stripped of his belongings from something relatively unrelated prior to these events (he only had a loincloth to his name. That was it), he stood up with his +60 to professional boxer and challenged the efreet after accumulating 7 games needing to be won, and after being denied, pounced on the efreet. After an insane amount of luck and good rolling, the efreet didn't break the grapple with any of his strength checks except for once, which was a very short-lived victory. And the spells he would cast would always yield a concentration check of a nat 3 or lower. Vlad was able to take the efreet down, scoring 11 damage a hit on the poor thing with his bare hands. He isn't even a monk. By the end of the battle, Vlad Tinpu stood with merely 6 hp and the efreet with 23. In that final round, Vlad delivered two blows, both for 12 damage, enough to bring the efreet to -1. So he finishes the efreet, finds a way back to the abyssal layer he was on via a ring on the efreet, and unintentionally intimidates the layer owner with his massive muscles and seemingly impossible stunt. The layer owner rightfully submitted.\n\n\nSo after a little bit of logic, we noticed that with the efreet dead, the players were no longer bound by contracts issued by the efreet to kill any targets, and that they were no longer marked. So not only did all of my players get amazing stat buffs, but they got the buffs for free.",

Once they are about ten minutes away, the sharpshooter pulls out his railgun, and shoots Wallace in the back of the head, shattering the windshield and sending the 120 odd passengers in to hysterics. The pilot then hops up to take control of the bus, but Wallace happens to be quite fat in his old age, the pilot tries to push him out of the seat but then slips in some blood and very nearly falls out the door, luckily this interrupted the sharpshooter, who was getting the passengers to shut up, one by one, with a 44 magnum. Then they team up and with their knives the cut Wallace into small pieces, then throw those out the window, then the sharpshooter finishes off the bus passengers. They then drop the bus off near the cemetery, and then they walk to the high school to see if they can find records of our \"gang\". They find that the person playing the sharpshooter has been missing for 50 years, the pilot is the school administrator, and find that myself, the dungeon master (I lack a better term) has been forced into an insane asylum, known as Bedlum Asylum on the space station London.\n  Once there they take a taxi to the Asylum, but before they enter, a man in a straight jacket jumps out the top story window, he lands with his leg broken, but he sprints down the street, only to be stopped by the Men in Black. They stop the runner, then begin wiping witnesses memories. Before they can get to our heroes, they dart inside to find a receptionist at a desk. They ask her about the man who jumped, and she responds \"What man, we haven't had an incident in over one hundred years.\" Then Ripley jumps up and grabs her gun, but the receptionist grabs her arm, forces her to the ground, and sedates her. Then Aflyu tries to shoot the receptionist, but she tazes him, then sedates him. *To be continued*",

        "text": "*This happened back in our older 3.5 campaign. I just thought I'd share!*\n\nOur party had finally arrived in the city of Avail, the metropolis port town of the campaign. It had something for everybody: gambling, weapons, drugs, booze, magic, temples, men, women, books, you name it! Our party wasn't there for fun, though (didn't stop them), but rather to talk to the head honcho of the town.\n\nThe person in charge wasn't the mayor, though. Through some diving into the skeevy underbelly of the town and getting some answers from some of the beaurocrats, they discovered the real puppetmaster behind the entire city: \n\nShe was strict, boxom half-nymph simply dubbed as \"The Madame\". She ran the biggest and most successful brothel in the city and had built the city up from the ground years ago. The Madame had other people 'in charge' in case of uprisings, foul play, etc. etc. \n\nThe Madame had a thick southern drawl, glasses purely to warp her vision, and an anatomically blessed pipe that made the male characters feel a little imasculated. She had little to no human decency; everything she would do was only ever out of pure financial desire. \n\nBut as concerning as she was (The group, especially the Paladin, was convinced she was trying to kill him), there was one person who put the group at edge. His name was Renaldo.\n\nHe was tall, gruff and had a dead-end stare that would find it's way into your soul. If the Madame was there, Renaldo was sure to be at her side, staring the group down. He was a man of few words, though. The only thing he would ever really bother to say was: \"....*Feed ze bears*...\"\n\nThe group was intensely at unease around him. Everyone felt queasy in their stomach and refused to be alone with him. Whenever he was about, he was just staring and grumbling about feeding bears. There was never a bear in the brothel, and whenever they saw him on the streets there were still never any bears. Just him and a big burlap sack over his shoulder. \n\nRenaldo was actually quite the businessman! He ran his own little inn named \"The Baby Bear\". It never had any customers, though. In fact, the whole building was more of a giant shed covered in splinters, misrepair and cobwebs. All except for the trap door under the floor. It must have had SOME business, though, people say they've heard yelling and growls coming from that direction. \n\nThe Paladin, Sir Dameon, was the most paranoid about Renaldo. While the other characters, distrusting of him as they were, just thought 'He's a braindead lunkhead who likes bears. Just leave him be and he'll leave us alone'.  Sir Dameon, however, was not satisfied with that answer. Sir Dameon was convinced Renaldo was, in fact, a werewolf or a werebear. One of the two. A were-*something*. \n\nAfter the first meeting, he would always have his sword on standby in his hand whenever Renaldo was around. He always was extra sure to keep his ears/eyes peeled whenever it was night to patrol for werewolf activities. He kept a silver dagger at him from that point on. He, both in and out of character, was SO CONVINCED that this character was a creature of the night that would tear the party to shreds if they let their guard down. No matter how many times the DM tried to explain 'NO, he's not a werewolf', Sir Dameon was having none of that. \n\nThe Madame had become our quest-giver, which meant frequent treks with Renaldo himself. Nothing serious, but just Renaldo showing the characters to places. The whole time Sir Dameon just waiting for the exact moment Renaldo would turn and pounce. \n\nBut he never did turn. Which drove Sir Dameon crazy. Instead of convincing him 'He's not a werewolf', it convinced him that he did it whenever the party was out of the area. He just HAD to know so he could kill Renaldo -being a lawful good Paladin, he needed evidence that this guy was actually a pure evil lycanthrope-. \n\nThere was even a time where they had come back from a quest and ran into Renaldo...who seemed like a totally normal guy. \n\n\"Oh. Hello...Renaldo...\"\n\n\"Oh, hello! I see you've made it back. The Madame'll be glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"Uh...t-thanks.....Um.......Why aren't you at the brothel?\"\n\n\"It's my day off.\"\n\n\"Oh. ...So...no bears?\"\n\n\"Bears? **BEARS**? ....*Feeeed za beeeears*....\"\n\nThis happened for the whole campaign. While the other characters just accepted that Renaldo was a creepy, bear-feeding-obsessed lunatic who was harmless, Sir Dameon kept a Dale Gribble level of paranoia whenever he was in town. Even as the town burned to the ground at the end, he sat there waiting for that moment where Renaldo would strike out in full beast mode. But he never did. He simply stood there with that vacant look in his eyes, grumbling in his gravely voice: \"Feed ze bears...\"\n\nSir Dameon and the group had left the port by the time Renaldo finally got to show off his bears. As the town was being attacked by marauders, he released his hungry bears into the frenzied fight. He did, in fact, get to feed the bears. No one in the party was there to see it, though. \n\nWhen the campaign ended, Sir Dameon and The Madame, believe it or not, got married (that whole relationship is another story entirely). I know Renaldo never left the Madame's side. I like to imagine on their honeymoon, Sir Dameon carrying his blushing bride to their bridal suite and placing her lovingly on the bed. They embrace tenderly in the flickering candlelight...the candles reflecting on a pair of empty, unblinking eyes staring from the closet as a quiet growl lurches from the closet doors: \"...*Feed ze beaaaars*...\". \n\nI like to think for the rest of Sir Dameon's life, Renaldo remained in the happy couple's house and just stood there. For their first child, for family get-togethers, for the holidays...Renaldo just never changing, always watching...always feeding ze bears.\n\n*The Madame and Renaldo was actually an inside joke between a friend and I, I just gave the idea to the DM and let him use it. It was funny to see what he did with it!*",

        "text": "[The silliest stories.](http://redd.it/2y5vbe) [Meet our humble party, Pratena the cyclops murderchild, Thoth the shabti magus, Rose the dullahan ranger, and Barrel the ~~storage object~~ halfling rogue.](http://imgur.com/a/4xfYd) Done that? good! Here's what they're up to.\n\nSo, everyone's sitting around in their big old mercenary hideout, doing trivial things like celebrating birthdays and lighting big piles of money on fire to gain the favor of the dice gods. Word comes through the party's boss that some political shit is going down in a nearby area (caused, of course, by the party), and that everyone is being hired to go and rescue some slaves that got displaced during military coup #2356 and were now under the employ of a rather unpleasant micro-nation of frogmen. What was happening was a lot like a merger of two big business, except with slightly less blatant racism and quiet murders. The idea was to go in, save the slaves (and a few mercenaries that Barrel had locked in a basement), and turn them over to a professional slaver.\n\nSo, basically swap out the murderous tyrannical leader for a plain old tyrannical leader.\n\nWell, the party set to it, because the slaves were going to die if they didn't do SOMETHING. They set about planning their cunning entrance into the hostile warzone where all the poor souls were kept. Step 1 would be getting past the border zone filled with orcs and other lovely folks who liked to fight anyone who entered their territory. They got past them by pretending to be traders and quoting regulations and agreements until the charging horde got bored and wandered off. One down!\n\nNext up was a nation of gnomes and dwarves, whose affinity for technology was surpassed only by their obsessive appetite for regulations and neatness. The party had been there a few times, and it wasn't that bad, but there was trouble this time- what looked like a firing squad was going to execute a bunch of deserters who had tried to leave the country without filing the proper paperwork. This would not stand. The party had to do something, but they were iffy about blatantly attacking soldiers in a nation that they were marginally friendly with. They decided to do what they did best- sow the seeds of chaos.\n\nThe party shrouded itself in a thick cloak of smoke, Barrel pegged several gun-toting men with pepper smoke pellets, a very confused winter wolf was thrown into the commanding officer's face, a special guest helper was tasked with smashing all the gunners with a giant log that for some reason wouldn't stop screaming, and oh yeah, they filled the area with about 25 cubic feet of flaming popcorn. \n\nIt could be said that they created a distraction. The party quietly left while damn near everyone was trying to figure out just what the everloving buggernuggets had just happened.\n\nNext on the agenda was a very geographically small nation filled with more magic-y folk. The party was soon stopped by a patrol of soldiers riding pterodactyls, and asked why they were here. The party spouted some bullshit lines about being on a religious pilgrimage to enlighten the unwashed heathens of the world, and thus they wanted to join with those *cough* NOBLE AND WISE FOLKS WHAT RIDE THE BIG LIZARD-BIRDS. The soldiers accepted this explanation and summarily assigned to be ~~cannon fodder~~ ~~arrow magnets~~ VERY FORWARD SCOUTS. Long story short, everyone got rammed into saddles/reigns/a giant burlap sack affixed to one or more pterodactyls, and directed to the massive wall of not-china and the hundreds of archers menacingly wielding bows.\n\nRose critted her animal empathy check and commanded the pterodactyl swarm up and out of arrow range from within her command sack. On the whole it went smoothly, except for the part where Barrel decided to drop some of his alchemist's fire on the wall below and crit failed the attack roll. The flaming, plummeting rogue was smart enough to put himself out before opening his parachute, which his now-riderless mount decided to grab. The party rode onward, with the unfortunate Barrel trailing behind like a majestic, screaming flag.\n\nThey touched down in some nearly uninhabited farmlands to plot out their next move. The first step, obviously, was to raid the giant-ass castle that they had not entirely pillaged on their previous visit- besides, they had locked the mercenaries they were supposed to rescue in the castle's basement, so it was clearly worth checking out. The trouble was getting in.\n\nThe party grabbed some asian conical hats, hid the less conspicuous party members under a bunch of farm crops, and headed straight for the castle's service entrance. To really sell it, they had their speedy guest-star assistant stage an attack on the forces within, complete with a mock attack on the approaching \"supply wagon\". They sold it well enough that the men inside actually sent out an honor guard to protect them.\n\nWith that, they quietly slipped away towards the treasure room while the castle guards were sufficiently distracted. They nabbed what loot they could, got a promising lead on the location of the mercenaries, and gave quite a *supplies* to anyone who tried to stop them leaving (sorry). They high-tailed it out of there while their speedy friend covered the escape by stabbing anyone who looked at him funny.\n\nNext up was the mass of slaves toiling in the port city. Traveling block-by-block wasn't going to cut it, so they appropriated a ship, fired its cannons at anything looking like an authority figure, and had Thoth broadcast a loud message to the city in the sultry voice of Morgan Freeman, instructing anyone who wasn't an idiot to get on the damn boat. And with that, they had gathered up all the slaves in the city. The only thing left was the mercenaries.\n\nThe party sailed up to the warehouse where everyone was sure the mercenaries were being held, and demanded (in a Morgan Freeman way) that the mercenaries be released. The people in the warehouse shot arrows, so the party returned the favor with cannons. They then entered through the convenient door that had just been installed, and found the mercs being accosted by the leader of the frogman nation and a bunch of samurai wielding swords. The berserk emperor immediately started hacking at the unarmed mercs, which the party found offensive, so they moved in to assist. A series of punches, stabs, lightning bolts and hilariously lethal barrels later, the barely-alive mercenaries were escorted out over the steaming corpse of the nation's ruler.\n\nThat just left their escape. They were still neck-deep in enemy territory, and chances were every soldier and their bizarre amphibian dog were advancing on their precious cargo of liberated slaves. They needed a quick getaway, and all they had at hand was about a half-dozen giant pterodactyls.\n\nSo Thoth cast enlarge person on them, along with a bunch of strength buffs, and Rose's Ark rose gracefully over the landscape, making a beeline for freedom. Unfortunately, 500 people is pretty fucking heavy even if they are halflings, and the boat started to lose altitude fast. The pterodactyls had just enough strength to fly the ship out to the great wall of not-china, which they didn't have the height to clear. Fortunately, height isn't so much an issue when you have a great deal of mass and momentum, and the top of the wall was leveled by the world's first flying battering ram. The group of orcs, who had been watching, thought this was fucking AWESOME and immediately charged the scrambling soldiers as the party escorted all of the slaves out of the ruined ship and into sweet, sweet freedom.\n\nIt was a bit awkward when the party's employer showed up, meaningfully waving a set of manacles. The party did some negotiating, and talked the hobgoblin down to half price if they let all the halflings go but kept the mercenaries. The party then escorted the remaining slaves to a safe-ish gnome village, got drunk, and threw a massive party.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Where the hell are the brakes\", KNOCK KNOCK WE'RE HERE TO KILL YOU AND WHY ARE THERE RATS IN MY NEW HOUSE-CART!](http://redd.it/307b54)",

        "text": "In our older 3.5 campaign of D&amp;D, I had given my DM my character's background information. The background information included things like her hometown, her community, the war, and of course her parents. I should also mention that I'm a cartoonist and I have a habit of doodling things when I'm trying to think things through. So when it came to the part with my character's parents, my DM must have thought something was wickedly funny about how I drew them. I admit to describing the father as being a very passionate and 'eccentric' man who took his job as raising bees very seriously. For some reason, I drew him with his arms flailing manically while shouting \"BEEEEEES!\". But again, I doodle stupid crap all the time, so I didn't think it would stick. Now with that information out of the way...\n\nThe cast was:\n-Sir Dameon, Paladin of the Flaming Hearts\n-Charna, Elven Duskblade of mystery\n-Faeron, half-elf noble and adventuring rookie\n-Yo'lun'ma Honeygrove-Stardust, elven cleric of Pelor (my character)\n\nThey were making their way north and were trekking through the forest. The forest was very familiar to Yo'lun'ma and she soon realized it was her hometown. As they had been traveling a good while, Yo'lun'ma promised they could most likely stay at her parents' house (as opposed to sleeping on the ground and potentially be eaten by bears). \n\nThis was the introduction of Bee-dad. They were finding their way through the grove of beehives, literally buzzing with bees, when they came across her father. He was in the middle of breeding assassin bees. More deadly than that was his puns.Oh god, the puns.\n\n\"Oh, you shouldn't wear those. My babies are more fond of YELLOW JACKETS! Like that? That was a real STINGER. Come now, we should go. This grove is BUZZING with activity!\"\n\nAnd every time he said 'bees', he would toss his head back and flail his arms wildly in the air. This happened at a rapid fire frequency. Sir Dameon nodded polietly, Charna raised an eyebrow, and Faeron attempted bashing his head through treebark with each pun. Meanwhile Yo'lun'ma is just \"What? Don't your fathers act like this?\". \n\nThey went back to the cozy Honeygrove household after the 50th bee pun. In came Bee-Mom. In contrast to her father, Bee-mom was quiet. In fact, she was either yawning, falling asleep, or hitting on the other adventurers. Just a typical visit back home. \n\nSo, that particular scene ends with a small living room with our four adventurers and the parents. Sir Dameon polietly sitting in between the two parents, one ranting about BEEEEEES!!, the other stroking his chin. Faeron banging his head on the wall to make the puns stop. Yo'lun'ma, usually so polite, head in her hands, groaning \"Mom, dad, you're embarassing me!\"\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. I mean aside from the DM going to crazy extremes with these characters (Don't get me wrong; I thought it was hilarious!). But he developed them a little on his own.\n\nThe elves were in frequent war with the orcs, who were trying to tear down their forest. As it so happened, when our characters were resting, was when the orcs decided to have another go at the forest. Being adventurers, of course the PCs picked up their gear and were raring to go. But what a surprise to see Bee-Dad and mum joining their sides.\n\n\"What are you doing? Go home where it's safe!\"\n\"I think we've stayed home enough. We can help,\" Bee-dad suggests, as he slides his wife's wedding ring off of her finger.\n\nAt that moment, her eyes bug out and she lets out a frenzied roar, charging ahead of everybody. Bee-Dad pulls out a wand, smiles, and follows after her with his battle cry: \"BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!\" This tiny, frail elf woman was out before anyone, cracking skulls and ripping faces as her husband summoned killer bees and even used 'enlarge' on his lovely wife. The battle then ended with a now giant, beserking bee-mom stomping and kicking orcs out of her way.\n\nIt turns out that mum and pop were more than just harvesting honey. Bee-Dad was actually a wizard. And mum? She was a beserker when they met...he just 'enchanted' their wedding bands to act as a tranquilizer so he could live through their marriage. \n\nMost people are shocked at the revelation that their parents once played guitar, danced, studied, etc....Yo'lun'ma had to process this for a while.\n\nNot the most action-packed story ever, but I thought it was entertaining. I now loving giving extra details to the DM, just to see what he'll do with them.",

        "text": "&gt;I've been DM'ing a Death watch campaign for about six months, we play every other sunday. Being a nice DM I force my players to write a battle-report after each session for their inquisitor (when they can reach one). \nI plan on giving these reports to a group of friends who are not playing with us this time to pass judgement. \n\n&gt;A bit of backstory on the setting, they have been sent to an ancient system in the eastern fringe. The system was lost during the Horus Heresy and contains a lost giant shipyard called Atlas. They have lost contact with the Imperium because of a warpstorm heralding Hive Fleet Kraken. The group haven't yet figured out that the hive fleet will destroy the system in about 20 years. \n\n&gt;Anyway, not much is known about the system and their mission is to cleanse it from the Orcs currently swarming the system. \n\n**The squad: **\n\nTactical Marine Marbas - *Dark Angel* \n\nTech-Marine Kadai - *Salamanders*\n\nPsyker Janos Carstein - *Blood Angels*\n\nDevastator Sarlok - *Iron hands*\n\nWolf-Scout Einar - *Space Wolfs*\n\nAssault Marine Kestyr - *Storm Wardens*\n\nSinguinary Priest Torox - *Flesh Tearer*\n\nHere's their first battle-report.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**The Stratos Campaign - Battle-Report #001**\n\nAs written by Deathwatch Techmarine Kadai\n\nDate: 9800815.M41\n\nLocation: Closing in on G8FC1, code name: “GYR”\n\nPre-Mission Notes:\n\nAfter an unplanned emergency exit from the immaterium approx. 1-2 hrs before scheduled ETA (due to a sudden “warp-storm” - as explained by Janos - our assigned Librarian), we emerged at the outer rim of our destination system. \nOur ship suffered major damage to its systems, but back-up generators and life support seems to be intact. Initial diagnosis made by myself and the crew indicates that we will be able to repair the ship to its former specifications and capabilities - given enough time.\nHowever our navigators was irreversibly lost in the warp during the aforementioned immaterium-exit. Our Librarian speculates that their very souls became trapped in the warp, when we exited... May the Emperor be with them.\nDue to this unfortunate loss it would seem that we are stranded here, without any means of traversing the warp safely… This does however NOT change the mission parameters and we are headed to the eight planet of the system - G8FC1 code name “GYR”.\nRepairs of the ship’s systems are underway, and I have found a way to use the generator of one Stormraven (outfitted with extra fire-power) as a backup to The Undeniable Vengeance’s own generators - to prevent sudden loss of life support. This is of course only a temporary solution, until we can get the main generators online.\n\n---\n\nScans of G8FC1 reveals three moons. All of them seems to have been used as triangulation relays, scanners and gun platforms. GI16C1 have a NOC-headquarters and have been selected as our main priority for the time being. Even though GI16C1 itself has no DS Scanners, the scanners on GI14C1 and GI15C1 would be useless to us without the NOC to link them to The Undeniable Vengeance.\n\n*Librarian Janos has stated that he senses a presence on the moon, but has failed to clarify whether it is friendly or hostile. Our Kill Team is preparing to take a Stormraven and engage the first mission of the campaign.*\n\n\n\n**Mission Report:**\n\n**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - *Secure the NOC and link it to The Undeniable Vengeance*\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE - *Secure eventual relays and link them to the NOC*\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE - *Investigate the presence sensed by Librarian Janos***\n\nAfter a thorough scan of the planet with the Stormraven in close range, we found 2 possible drop sites - one on each side of the moon. We chose the one closest to The Undeniable Vengeance as our first target.\nAs we began our approach we sent the standard imperial identification-codes, and got a “ping” in response - but nothing else. We did however see a gigantic vessel “parked” outside of the base. Neither of us recognized the model or designation of this vessel, but it seemed like some kind of mining barge.The base was shielded from the vacuum of space by a force-field. I managed to appease and talk to the base’s machine spirit by interfacing with it via an external data-port, and it gave me full access to the complex’s internal systems. We decided to make out presence known and asked all the inhabitants to identify themselves, or we would take the base by force by shutting down the life support. This was met by resistance as the inhabitants shut down the power to the outer hangar where we were positioned. We began the cleansing of the now assumed hostile forces by clearing the hangar and continuing to the main hall.\n\nAs we entered, we immediately was attached by greenskins. Our best calculations tells us that the enemy force consisted of approx. 50 or so standard Orks, in two different colored armor-types. It would later be explained to us by our Tactical Adviser, Manfred, that this force was separated into two different clans, and by his best guess and experience with Orks, this would mean that a third - bigger - clan was ordering this force to infiltrate this base.\nDuring the fighting a small group of Orks escaped the base - and ran into the vacuum of space. My assessment is that they preferred to die alone, on the cold surface of the moon, instead of facing the Emperor’s Finest on the battlefield. Xenos scum.\nWe cleared the building of remaining greenskins, and I interfaced with the machine spirit of the NOC in order to complete our primary objective. It seemed like the greenskins had attempted to relay the NOC-signal to their own gain, but I shut it down and linked it up with The Undeniable Vengeance as the mission dictated. We would also put up an encryption on the main terminal, shut down all remaining life support, and set up pict-recorders with motion-proximity-alarms at the entrance, the generators and the main terminal to prevent further unauthorized access. In the search of the base we found a Combi-Tool that could be of great value in the future.\nWe left the base and investigated the Mining Barge. Bio-scans revealed life forms on-board. We entered through a hole in the back of the barge, and by repairing an airlock and bypassing the filthy xenos’ attempt to turn the most holy machine spirit on it’s own devoted servant - we cleared the barge with relative ease. Got it’s identification-codes - and locked it down.\nThe landing-site on the other side of the moon was already cleared. We took the same security-precautions as on the first site. On this site we also found an intact - but encrypted dataslate. It has been copied and are awaiting decryption. \nThis marked the completion of the mission and the return to The Undeniable Vengeance.\n\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n\nAdded Inventory:\n+ 1x Combi-Tool\n+ 1x Encrypted Dataslate (No.1 - GI16C1)\n+ 1x Mining Barge (GI16C1) \n\nNote: After comparing the identification-codes to imperial archives, it would seem that this type of vessel is not part of any known STC-schematics, but is in itself by ancient imperial design. This Barge should be - if at all possible - brought to the Adeptus Mechanicus for study and maybe reverse-engineering. This type of lost technology to mine/harvest directly from a Gas-planet could benefit the Imperium immensely!\n\nLost Inventory:\n- 25x Bolter-rounds\n- 3x Frag Grenades\n\nXP GAINED: 250XP\n\n\nEDIT: Formatting is hard",

        "text": "Hello /r/gametales,\n\nToday I want to tell you a story about a group of adventurers.  Yes I know, not the most original start to a story, but that is where this one begins.\n\nThe young cadre of explorers had been given a task of bringing balance to the forest.  The logging village was under attack from the forest critters.  The forest critters were pissed at an old druid giving them sentience, they were simple folk.\n\nTo bring balance back, the druid had to be dealt with.  Our intrepid band of friends know how to solve problems in only one way, horrifically violent murders.  The druid was quickly dispatched.\n\nUpon this druid, a certain item was found.  A [deck of cards](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/artifacts/minor-artifacts/deck-of-many-things).  The young skald in the group had heard legends of this deck.  Those that drew from the it would be granted a boon, or possibly cursed beyond measure.  Naturally, the heroes looked deep within themselves.  They debated if they had the will for what needed to be done.  They asked themselves the one question they knew needed to be answered.  How do they monetize this?\n\nThe answer was simple.  A village full of god fearing villagers would jump at the chance to prove their devoutness and be granted a gift due in their faithfulness.  A small discussion with the local priest followed.  \n\nThe next day it was announced any person could try their luck and seek the favors of their gods.  If anything was received, a small donation was asked of those that brought the cards.\n\nThe townspeople flocked to the church.  In all, one-hundred and eight villagers showed up to try their hand.  Of those brave parishioners, thirty-two were lost to places unknown, had their souls ripped from their bodies, or were forced to face the wrath of the gods in the form of a dread wraith.\n\nAll was not bad though.  At the end of the day, a lumberer was given back his deceased wife(now pregnant with child).  Eleven citizens were gifted with castles and political guile.  The priest himself was given the experience of a great cleric, and a flaming sword as a boon.  Even young Timmy, the orphan, found himself granted three wishes.  Which he quickly used on looks, wealth, and a harem, as any street urchin would.\n\nBut what of the adventurer's?  Well while the towns people did indeed prosper, they also reverently gave the donations to those that brought them great fortune.  At the end of the day, they rested their heads on bags of gold numbering over 350,000 pieces, inside of their very own castle, with sixteen magic items of their own to carry off on more adventures...or the next town....",

        "text": "Well I'm back with another post about my friends during our dnd sessions. If you haven't read the other post about these idiots then you should go read that one first because I'm not going to recap their characters. \nSo the party finds a tomb down in the cave the goblins were mining, obviously they were trying to get into the tomb. The players enter and follow a necromancer, a man who seems to be the leader of the goblins. A few stereotypical encounters later, they have found a secret passage that leads to a door into a large room in which a band of goblins have camped. They don't really think, these friends of mine, rather, they act on impulse. So what does their instinct tell them to do? Why sing a song! That's right, the bard elf, and cleric all start singing a campfire song. I won't even bother trying to write out the lyrics to their song, especially since it was improved. Needless to say it was terrible. \nThe goblins, being even more idiotic than the idiots decided now was a good time to listen to an area of wall where noise was coming from. They didn't actually realize that there was potentially a passage on the other side. The dwarf slapped the singers. Loudly. The Goblins heard that too. Then the barbarian slapped the dwarf. The little guy bounced. The goblins drew their weapons. Then the party kicked open the door.\nThe door slammed a goblin, smashing it against the wall, but that didn't stop the rest of the goblins swarming. Pretty soon, the barbarian was getting butt fucked. You see, the adventurers didn't really think about their surroundings. The passage was one square wide, not big enough for more than one person at a time, and they can't move through each other (that's a stupid rule). So the barbarian is trying to fight back and all the rest of the part can do is watch. Well, not all of them. The ones in the back fail their perception checks and forget they are actually in a tunnel. The bard runs into a wall. The elf wanders off. The rogue unsuccessfully throws his hammers at the goblins. It was bad for all of them. By the time they actually got out of the tunnel, the barbarian was down and they hadn't done anything to the goblins. And their magical support was nowhere to be seen. The elf completely forgot they were in combat, until reminded by the bard screaming at her while smashing a goblin down the tunnel towards her. The combat ends with lots of frustration and disappointment from all. \nThey rest in that room, and then the sexual advances begin. The only female in the party, the elf wizard, suddenly finds herself surrounded by three different men of different races, all trying to get in her pants. The current standing is barbarian in the lead for sex getting, rogue (with a -7 to getting in her pants) and the cleric (with a lovely -29 to getting the nasty), the bard refuses to participate, fearing he would somehow harm her. After being shot down multiple times, the rogue sits down and starts to build a holster for himself. Yes, you heard me, a holster. How does he do this you ask? he slices up a goblin sleeping bag and uses it to make a holster. But what is he holstering? two of the goblins had hand crossbows, so he decided to take them and use them for his own. I think okay, what's his plan here? Well if his plan was to make a bitchin' holster, then he succeeded. He rolled a 20. He made a masterwork bandoleer, holster and weapon strap all in one, with cloth from a ratty bed roll. That's the idiots in a nutshell, they can't hit shit in combat, but when it comes to utter stupidity, they can always crit succeed. So now the rogue has a holster that allows him to switch weapons instantly, without having to waste a turn.\nMuch later, they have found a large room with an iron maiden in each corner. After being thoroughly fucked by some skeletons (who they only beat because I crit failed four times and accidentally killed all of the enemies), they are now in this large room with a well in the middle and iron maidens on the sides. Also, the bard is on fire. He is fully on fire, and burning up. The skeletons from the last battle included two fire skeletons. The bard got roasted by them and he has yet to put himself out. Rather than help the bard, the party watches. He fails his saving throw, and takes 10 damage. They start to discuss how they could help him, including \"Stop, Drop and Roll\" but in the end just let him roll again. He fails again and takes 10 more damage. The bard is starting to dance while on fire. It is a very intricate dance, with more than a few hip thrusts, but it doesn't help him put out the fire. They point out that they have water, but the elf feels that wasting the water is pointless and just stand back. The bard is very crisped now, and once again fails his saving throw, the next fail will kill him. The cleric, in a spot of brilliance, decides to heal the bard, he also sings staying alive while doing so, in the hopes that having a motivational song will help (it doesn't). But that's all the idiots do. The bard fails again. The bard fails again. Finally, the bard realizes that he can roll around and put out the fire. \nSo that's the Merry Band of Idiots. They are left in a room that stands smelling like burnt goliath bard and with horrible scars, but hey they lived right? \n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ydqen/star_wars_edge_of_empire_the_shirt_bandits_and/",
        "text": "Good day, /r/gametales! Been a while! I mentioned at one point that I was working with a group on an on-again, off-again sandbox campaign for Star Wars: Edge of Empire. Today's session was pretty great, so I thought I'd share.\n\nFirst, some background. The Shirt Bandits are a group of amoral putzes who fell in together while thoroughly destroying the game's intro adventure. Our cast:\n\n* The Furbag: The sole Wookiee on the crew. Thoughtful, kindhearted, introspective, and well-learned. He's the team muscle when he has to be (though not as much as you might expect from a Wookiee), he's basically the closest thing to a moral center and mitigating influence that the group has. This would matter a lot more if anyone else on the crew besides the Killbot actually understood the Wookiee language. Fights with his fists, though he did recently come across a nice vibro-axe.\n* The Dealer: The Bothan on the crew is the negotiator. He doesn't actually take the forefront in most encounters (preferring to leave that to the Pilot), and he's not so good in combat, but he's an absolute master at wheeling and dealing. When the crew turns the Dealer loose on a world, if it's there to be found, he can find it. When he has to fight, he has a very dangerous (and quite illegal) disruptor pistol he usually keeps hidden.\n* The Pilot: The crew's pilot and, generally, the secondary \"face,\" is a flashy Duros with a weird thing for [Cad Bane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoSayqv1TVI), to the point where he's taken the name and is doing his best to imitate the character by purchasing a jet pack (with eventual intent to have it modified into a set of jet boots). He's the most outgoing of the group and handles a lot of the face-to-face work. His imitation of a notorious and dangerous bounty hunter while traveling with a group of people who all manage to have some form of bounty on their heads will *not* cause trouble for the group down the road, I swear. Fights with dual blasters when he does have to fight.\n* The Killbot: Apparently a semi-defective assassin droid, the Killbot is a sneaky, amoral type. Deadly with a blaster rifle but not with much else, the Killbot can be a bit bad about getting the party in trouble. He tends to act as the party translator, as he's the only member of the group who can understand Mate's binary speech and the Furbag's native language, though he has been known to \"creatively\" interpret things before.\n* \"Mate\": Originally a generic NPC R4 astromech unit, the crew took an instant liking to Mate's bloody-minded outlook and tendency to communicate via rebus-style images from his holoprojector. They adopted him as a full member of the crew, and he handles ship maintenance and guards the ship while the rest of the party is off. Refuses to fight, since he's only armed with a simple shockprobe.\n\nFresh off of capturing moderately-notorious glitterstim smuggler Bandin Dobah, hocking him off to Kessel for some nice Imperial bounty cash, and finding buyers for his stash, the party was on their way to Corellia to find someone capable of telling them more about a piece of extremely old, potentially-valuable tech they ripped off of some other smugglers. \n\nIt's at this point that Mate calls a meeting and plugs into the ship's computer so he can communicate through text on a monitor. He tells the crew he has \"bad news, really bad news, and worse news.\"\n\nThe bad news is that Mate, as an astromech droid, is optimized and designed for emergency triage and maintenance work, and that he is neither programmed nor equipped to be the ship's primary maintenance technician. (Gently suggesting that this could be rectified with the proper upgrades, of course.)\n\nThe really bad news is that this ship, a slightly beat-up YT-1300 freighter (same model as the Millenium Falcon without all the nice custom work) which was freshly ripped off from some of Dobah's goons, was not actually in the best of shape and that certain parts, most pertinently the hyperdrive motivator, were actually on the verge of failure.\n\nThe WORST news, however, was the fact that the closest system, in fact the only system Mate could detect which was within what he estimated to be within reasonable \"limp range,\" was so much of a backwater it made Tatooine look like a trade hub. Tatooine is at least frequented by smugglers and nasty types; this place is so far off the beaten path that even the nasty types don't have interest. It has farms and gets visited a couple times a year by traders who pick up loads of fresh food to sell elsewhere, and not much else.\n\nThey land in the space port. It's so small that they couldn't have landed if they were much bigger, it has exactly three berths, and one of those berths is occupied by a ship that looks to have been there so long it's rusted out.\n\nThey're quickly greeted by the spaceport owner, a chubby human with a beard, clothes made from fur and leather, and a big slugthrower slung across his back. \"Why, hello there, spacemen. What brings you to our little neck of the woods?\"\n\nThe Wookiee starts to answer, drawing a slack-jawed gape from Spaceport Bob.\n\n\"I ain't never seen a spaceman that furry before. Nice to meet you, furry spaceman.\"\n\nSpaceport Bob is friendly enough and quickly informs them that Crazy Earl, the local mechanic, would sure be glad to fix their busted hyperdrive parts. Except...\"\n\n\"Problem is, you folks'll be here 'bout three months, on account of Earl's too busy putting up electro-fences to keep people from getting ate by The Destroyer.\"\n\nThat caught their attention. They ask some questions, and quickly find out that the Destroyer is some sort of super-predator that showed up fairly recently.\n\n\"What does it eat?\"\n\n\"Iunno. Nobody never seen it eat. Figure it eats basic'ly anything it wants, we don't usually find much left behind. Even tried to eat a tractor, once, only it didn't much like the taste and spat most of it back out.\"\n\n\"What does it look like?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows! On account of anyone around here who saw the Destroyer gen'rlly don't see much of anything else again coz they all got ate by the Destroyer.\"\n\nThey unload their speeder and go for a ride through the local settlement, taking along Mrs. Spaceport Bob (who has *much* more interest in the big, strong furry spaceman than would otherwise be anywhere near appropriate for a married woman) as a guide. They pass Birdbrain Billy's ranch, who raises some sort of huge indigenous flightless bird with whitish-yellow feathers and bad tempers, and then they make it out to Crazy Earl's warehouse.\n\nEarl is gruff but helpful enough. He says he's too busy to even talk price, it's all he can do to keep putting up the extreme-voltage electrical fences that seem to be the only thing capable of fending off the Destroyer. Of course, while Furbag and the Pilot talk business with Earl, Killbot and the Dealer are *stealing* a half-broken MD-0 medical droid from Earl's warehouse and hiding it on the landspeeder.\n\nThe team quickly determines that they need to either plan a long vacation or find a way to deal with the Destroyer. Owing to the fact that the Furbag is absolutely uninterested in either local ladies *or* in the extremely close interest many of them seem to be taking in him, they start laying plans for the Destroyer.\n\nThey stop by Birdbrain Billy's and offer to buy one of his birds. They ask if they can be trained for riding; Billy laughs and states that the birds are almost pure evil and vicious to boot, showing them his typical gear: it looks more or less like a badly-dented suit of full plate mail.\n\nThe Pilot, meanwhile, has wandered out onto the field to investigate the carcass of one of the birds, which wound up frying itself on the farm's electrofence. The alpha of the group, an especially large bird, quickly charges him and tries to attack him; he jets off the ground using his jetpack to avoid it, and then gets an idea.\n\nThey ask Billy if they can have *that* bird. Billy nods, saying that he'd practically pay *them* to get rid of it, that he'd tried putting it down before but that it's smart enough to hide whenever it sees a gun and vicious enough that when he'd tried to bludgeon it to death it had taken the weapon and chomped it in half.\n\nThe Pilot flies over the field with a long chain and throws it around the bird's neck, catching it with the lasso. The group cheers, because they mean to use the bird as bait for the Destroyer.\n\nIt was then that the Pilot noticed that the freaking thing was climbing up the chain, an evil glare on its face. Thinking fast he flies toward the fence and drops the chain, attempting to dump the bird onto the fence. It flapped its wings and managed to make it over, giving the group one last evil look before fleeing into the woods.\n\nThey finished their preparations, apologizing to Billy for losing the bird (he just sighed, shook his head, and went back inside), contriving to *un-steal* the medical droid (both Furbag and Mate were not terribly happy about what Killbot and the Dealer had done, especially once they found out that the MD-0 was basically the only thing on the planet with anything like modern diagnostic sensors), and heading out to the woods in the middle of the night to try to lure out the Destroyer.\n\nNights pass. Nothing. Nothing on thermals, not even indigenous animals-there should be other large predators, but they're just *gone,* either Destroyed or fled.\n\nUntil the third night.\n\nThe ship is hovering overhead while the Furbag walks around as bait (since Devilbird escaped). He hears something and immediately books it up the nearest and largest tree, but the crew on the ship can see nothing on either thermals or visual.\n\nAnd then something starts to uproot the tree. The Furbag fails to keep his grip and winds up falling out of the tree as it heads toward the ground. He hits the ground and starts sprinting, as The Destroyer starts chasing him... *from underground.* It's a flipping subterranean monster.\n\nHe tries to find a safe spot, but there was nothing. The crew tries blasting the Destroyer with their laser cannons, but the heavy laser can't penetrate the ground.\n\nFurbag, still sprinting, orders the ship to create a clearing by blasting down trees ahead. They do so, and he moves into the clearing, intending to use the fallen trees and debris to protect himself from the Destroyer while the ship picks him up. And then toothy, mawed tentacles burst out of the ground and start blindly feeling around for the Furbag.\n\nHe probably would have been dinner if the Killbot hadn't scored a brilliant hit on one of the tentacles with the laser turret, frying it and sending the Destroyer back underground. Before it can come back, the ship moves in for pickup.\n\nAt which point Devilbird runs in. The bastard was still alive; it turned out that it ran faster than the Destroyer could tunnel, so it had actually been chasing Devilbird around off and on for days without being able to catch it. It ran right past Furbag, giving him a hiss and an evil look as it did.\n\nMy intent, as DM, was for the Devilbird to draw off the Destroyer and keep running.\n\nFurbag had other ideas. He quickly draw his vibroax and, with a bit of luck, lopped off the Devilbird's leg. It screeched, hit the ground, and was immediately snagged by tentacles and dragged underground.\n\nFurbag quickly grabbed a rope ladder and got up to the ship while the Devilbird squawked its last, and the crew jetted off while they worked to come up with a plan to deal with a monstrous creature none of them had ever heard of before.",

        "text": "I'm DMing a campaign right now that started months ago but even now we're all still noobs to D&amp;D in general. I feel like I need to write down what's going on in the campaign both for our sake and hopefully for your enjoyment.\n\nThe campaign started off with the following characters:\n\n1. Karen: A young cute Human female necromancer with a fondness for skeletons rolled by the guy who always makes kawaii female characters.\n\n1. Ogre Face (His character name was literally a drawing of an ogre's face): A dumb Human monk with very low stats who was convinced that he was an \"Ogre ninja.\" He was trained as a monk by Karen's father, so the two go way back.\n\n1. Pipe Sensei: A Gnome sorcerer who was constantly high on \"Wacky Tabaccy\" and only used magician-like spells (such as prestidigitation to cast sparks and light candles and whatnot).\n\n1. Urist Dingy MacWingus: A height-ist five foot Dwarf fighter (he had a hatred for all taller than him) who was slightly insane and kept up the honor of his family through punching things. He also worshiped his great-great-great-great-great grandfather like a god.\n\n1. Buttons Uber McFlapJack: A dual-shield-wielding Gnome paladin with a hard-on for gold and really mediocre stats (other than his AC).\n\nThe adventure got out of hand really fast.\n\nThe party was tasked with delivering a caravan from the campaign's big city, Stonewall, down a road to a small town down south, Trapper's Town. The caravan was disguised as a farming caravan but the actual goal was to deliver magical artifacts in a chest. They started off in Stonewall with a few hours until nightfall which is when they were supposed to head out. Immediately Karen asked where she could gamble away her gold and I provided the arena as a means to do this while Dingy and Pipe Sensei decided that they wanted to fight in the arena. Karen heads to the betting area and immediately loses all of her gold in one go.\n\nDingy and Pipe Sensei were pinned against each other in the arena and Dingy instantly puts Pipe Sensei into a grapple. Dingy whispers into Pipe Sensei's ear, \"We're gonna rob this place clean, laddy.\" and attempts to throw him into the audience to cause a commotion. He fails his roll and throws Pipe Sensei straight into a wall. The crowd goes wild at the carnage. He tries again and succeeds. People start running now that the fight has been taken out of the arena. The rest of the party was spectating as well and stands around wondering what the hell is happening. \n\nMeanwhile, Buttons is inspecting the chest of magical artifacts they were tasked with delivering, realizing that this chest was in fact not locked, but decides not to open it in public out of better judgement and heads to an inn.\n\nPipe Sensei immediately starts running towards the betting area amongst the chaos with the goal of getting away with as much gold as he possibly can. He fits through the teller window, startling the elf working there and through a series of extremely terrible rolls on both ends, the elf attempts to escape through the door, only for Pipe Sensei to heat the handle up and burn him. He attempts to flee from the only remaining exit and ends up stuck in the teller window while Pipe Sensei begins taking as much gold as he possibly can. He then casts Message at the party members to whisper in their heads that they had to help him out of there so they could escape with the gold.\n\nKaren and Ogre Face head to the betting area to rescue their friend. Ogre Face sees the stuck elf and assumes he is preventing Pipe Sensei's escape and punches him square in the face, killing him. He eventually realizes that there is a door that needs breaking down instead and gets to doing that. Once freed, Pipe Sensei casts smoke cloud and the trio all make their escape while people are still panicking. \n\nKaren and Ogre Face go on ahead to the caravan while Pipe Sensei sits around counting out his gold in front of the arena, only to be interrupted by guards approaching from the distance. He pulls out some candles, and starts doing some shitty magic tricks lighting and unlighting them. The guards run up because of the commotion and see Pipe Sensei sitting there and ask him if he knows what's going on. He continues his shitty magic tricks and the guards realize that he's just some street performer and tell him to leave the area because they heard a fight broke loose.\n\nMeanwhile at the inn, Buttons opens the chest and sees that it contains two artifacts: a normal looking leather belt and a light grey gemstone about the size of a fist. Touching neither, he closes the box back up and considers buying a lock for it somewhere but ends up not going for it.\n\n^Side ^note: ^That ^belt ^was ^my ^first ^mistake.\n\nBack at the arena, Dingy is still sitting in the middle of the fighting grounds, both gates closed and he's stuck. The guards arrive and he's the only one there. They attempt to question him as to what happened but he convinces the guards to let him out so he could help them, only to make a run for it. He retreats to the safest place for a Dwarf in any civilized area: the Lost and Found.\n\n^Side ^note: ^Lost ^and ^Found ^buildings ^are ^commonplace ^in ^this ^universe ^and ^were ^invented ^by ^the ^Dwarves ^because ^they ^have ^a ^deep ^respect ^for ^people's ^property. ^This ^also ^means ^that ^most ^lost ^and ^founds ^are ^run ^by ^Dwarves.\n\nDingy has a discussion with the Lost and Found Dwarf about his great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Urist Pingy MacWingus, who was a legendary fighter in his time. After spending some time there, he returns to the caravan, sure that he had shaken off the guards by then.\n\nButtons eventually wanders his way back to the caravan and the party is reunited. This is where the real fun begins...\n\nThe caravan, pulled by two horses, travels down south on a dusty dirt road in the middle of some rolling plains. Ogre Face and Dingy walk ahead, Karen is sitting in the back with the chest, Buttons was driving the caravan, and Pipe Sensei was walking to the side. The landscape was dull and uninteresting, but while describing this to the party, I was passing notes to Karen about voices telling her to open the chest. After a few failed Wisdom saving throws, Karen knew that she *had* to open this chest at some point. \n\n^Side ^note: ^The ^point ^of ^these ^voices ^was ^that ^the ^gemstone ^was ^actually ^a ^magical ^prison ^that ^the ^God ^of ^Trickery ^and ^Chaos ^was ^bound ^to ^and ^that ^the ^belt ^was ^a ^belt ^of ^sex ^change. ^The ^whole ^idea ^was ^that ^Karen ^would ^put ^on ^the ^belt ^and ^would ^no ^longer ^be ^female ^so ^we ^could ^rid ^the ^player ^of ^having ^his ^way ^with ^yet ^another ^kawaii ^young ^female ^character. ^Of ^course, ^the ^God ^of ^Trickery ^loves ^tricky ^stuff ^like ^this ^and ^would ^totally ^compel ^a ^mortal ^to ^do ^something ^hilarious ^like ^that ^so ^it ^all ^works ^out ^right... ^^Right?\n\nA few hours into the trip, the party is ambushed by 4 wolves.\n\nKaren and Buttons immediately hop off the caravan, and approach the wolves. Karen one-shots one of them with a Witch Bolt. This victory was short-lived as the other three wolves immediately knocked Karen to 0 hp. The wolves then kill both horses which somehow got involved in the fight before they turn to Buttons with his dual shields. Pipe Sensei does some minor AOE damage with Acid Splash and Dingy and Ogre Face run towards the action.\n\n^Side ^note: ^Karen ^called ^Witch ^Bolt ^\"Bone ^Bolt\" ^instead ^because ^she ^had ^a ^thing ^going ^with ^skeleton-based ^puns.\n\nDingy arrives and rolls a natural twenty which vaporizes one of the wolves with a perfectly placed punch while letting out a primordial roar that terrifies the remaining wolves. He gets an attack of opportunity on one of them and kills it with his bare fists while the other runs away.\n\n^Side ^note: ^That ^natural ^twenty ^*had* ^to ^be ^super ^amazing ^otherwise ^that ^would ^have ^been ^a ^total ^party ^kill ^way ^too ^early ^to ^be ^fun.\n\nDingy takes the non-vaporized wolf corpse and keeps it with the intent of turning it into a hat later on. It is around this time that Ogre Face finally arrives at the scene of the fight. Karen is stabilized and healed with what little heals Buttons has access to with his mediocre Charisma.\n\nWithout any horses, there's not much of a caravan to be had, so Buttons takes the chest of artifacts and the party decides that they will walk the rest of the way to Trapper's Town... Or so they thought...\n\nUpon being resuscitated, Karen makes for a grab at the chest of artifacts that Buttons is holding. When Buttons resists, Karen casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter on him in order to stun him. She grabs the chest and in the same round Buttons breaks free from the laughter with a good Wisdom saving throw. Buttons attempts to wrestle the chest back from Karen realizing that something is up. \n\n^Side ^note: ^Karen ^called ^Tasha's ^Hideous ^Laughter ^\"Skeleton ^Joke\". ^This ^spell ^was ^cast ^on ^the ^party ^members ^plenty ^of ^times ^prior ^and ^involved ^passing ^the ^affected ^players ^notes ^with ^skeleton ^related ^puns ^on ^them.\n\nOgre Face sees this as an offense against his best friend and stabs Buttons to get him off of Karen. For whatever reason Buttons and Dingy see this as a huge over-reaction and decide to punish Ogre Face by bludgeoning him until he's unconscious.\n\nUsing Ogre Face's distraction to her advantage, Karen opens the chest and holds the belt high above her head and shouts, \"I HAVE THE BELT OF POWER!\" and places it on. She is immediately wracked with pain and collapses. \n\nPipe Sensei sits off to the side and watches the entire scene unfold before him. He casts some sparks for dramatic effect.\n\nDingy and Buttons discuss what to do and decide it would be best to tie up both Ogre Face and Karen as they were clearly threats to the party. Before they can tie up Karen, she grabs for the other artifact, the grey gemstone, and attempts to eat it. Upon touching it, energy radiates out and the gemstone disappears. \n\n^Side ^note: ^Ogre ^Face ^was ^tied ^up ^three ^times ^over ^since ^he ^committed ^the ^brutal ^act ^of ^stabbing.\n\nThey decide they should just remove the belt from Karen, put it back in the box, and then keep an eye on her since she both took the belt *and* managed to cause the gemstone to disappear. They find out that the belt is firmly attached to Karen and in no way will it come off. Of course, they come to the conclusion that if this is the case, they will just cut Karen into pieces in order to continue transporting the items, well item at this point, they were tasked with delivering.\n\nWhile debating on killing Karen I frantically waved my arms and asked them if they were *really* sure that they wanted to kill off their party member here and if maybe they instead wanted to wait *and see what happens*! \n\n^Side ^note: ^I ^determined ^beforehand ^that ^the ^sex ^change ^belt ^would: \n\n1. Take a few minutes to do its job.\n\n2. Cripple the wearer with pain during the transformation. \n\n3. Be irremovable until its job was done. \n\nThe party didn't pick up on any of the hints and slit Karen's throat then and there. The belt was still irremovable and they were getting frustrated. \n\nAt some point a few minutes later, they tried the belt one last time and it came off.\n\nThey also realized that Karen was now a man.\n\nThe party then figured out that my plan with the belt was to get Karen to not be a female character anymore, but they all managed to justify their actions.\n\n1. Buttons said that \"Karen was a backstabbing traitor that tried to disable me to take all the items in the box. I had to stop her because the mission, or somethin'.\"\n\n1. Dingy said \"We needed the belt.\"\n\n1. Pipe Sensei just got high and did some more magic tricks.\n\nWith the belt in the box, the party of Dingy, Buttons, and Pipe Sensei continued their mission down to Trapper's Town, leaving the corpse of Karen and the tied up Ogre Face in the middle of nowhere on this dirt road.\n\nUpon entering the outer reaches of Trapper's Town, the party encounters a man telling them there's a tax on entering the town right now due to heavy traffic, or something along those lines. Dingy successfully intimidates him telling him he just killed two people and doesn't need any of his shit. The scammer runs off scared.\n\nOnce they reached the town center, the party saw a group of villagers crowding around something. They push their way through the crowd and see a cow corpse. A little bit of questioning reveals to them that the goblins were at it again stealing cows from a nearby farm and leaving threats in the town.\n\nThe most natural reaction to the cow corpse was to place the sex-chance belt on whatever part of it they could fit it on to see what would happen. After remembering that the process takes time, they cut it off the cow so they could keep exploring the town. So, they walked around town carrying a slab of cow meat with a belt around it. \n\nAnd, instead of delivering this artifact that they just killed a person over, Buttons and Pipe Sensei decide the best thing to do with their new-found sex-changing powers was to take it to the local brothel to turn some whores into men.\n\nDingy goes to the tannery instead to get his wolf corpse turned into a wolf hat to display his domination over all wolf-kind.\n\nAt some point inside of the brothel the cow meat slips free of the belt. Pipe Sensei scores the party a deal on the prostitutes by sharing some of his Wacky Tabaccy with the pimp. The now stoned pimp thought that Pipe Sensei's magic tricks were awe-inspiring.\n\nButtons and Pipe Sensei go back to a room with one of the fine ladies and slip the belt on her. She screams and cries out in pain until she eventually becomes a man. Upon completion of the transformation, the duo take the belt off the prostitute and he (formerly she) runs out screaming.\n\nThe party decides that this is enough adventuring for the day and they all grab rooms at an inn and sleep for the night.\n\nThe entire time, Ogre Face struggles in his binds repetitively, failing to break the ropes. He begins losing faith in his Ogre-ness and with the last words of \"Me... Not... Ogre?\" he bites his tongue in an attempt to commit suicide. Unfortunately he does this wrong, biting off his tongue entirely instead of biting it to swell and choke him to death, so he's left struggling in the road yelling \"KAH-HEN!\" over and over until he passes out and eventually a caravan picks him up.\n\nI wasn't prepared for any of this.\n\n...\n\nThis was only the first session.",

        "text": "About to start a once-a-month campaign with some friends this upcoming weekend. We've been plotting it for a few months now and I've had my character pretty set... Except, I have no idea what to name a Gnoll!\n\nAnyway, some backstory might add some details too; He's not your typical brute...\n\nIn this homebrew campaign, there is a continent which, up until 1000 years ago, a human civilization existed and prospered. Until a Khan-like swarm of Gnolls came out of nowhere and took over the entire continent / country, staking it for themselves while the surviving humans escaped across the ocean.\n\nOver time, the Gnolls even slowly started to adopt a bit of a \"civilized\" society, taking over the ruins and buildings, much to the surprise of spies from all races watching in. However, not all Gnolls were interested in civilization, and as such, a large bit (let's call it half) of the Gnolls resist moving into society and still roam and keep to their ancestral ways. (In fact, one of the large drives to start soon after Campaign begins I believe is going to be a civil war of sorts. Anywho...)\n\nMy Gnoll represents a Gnoll who was never the strongest in the area while growing up amongst others his age; And while beginning to be civilized, Gnoll society still at this point shuns most \"intelligent\" studies of magic, preferring to show superiority through brute strength / physical combat. My Gnoll tried, of course, but he was a bit of a runt and was picked on a lot.\n\nAs such, he tended to shun away from fights... Though the other Gnolls didn't quite like that and would try to drag their favorite chew toy into it. My Gnoll ran one day from the boys chasing him and wound up deep in a forest, stumbling upon some ancient human ruins.\n\nDeep in the human's ruins, my Gnoll found a black blade scimitar. The second he picked up the curious treasure, it communicated telepathically with him, teasing the Gnoll with promises of power greater than any physical strength alone could match. It convinced him to study magic as well as his body, to learn to augment his strength with spells, become a Magus, and show all the other Gnolls that true power comes in all shapes.\n\nSo, that's about his backstory. He finds the sword, is convinced to learn magic, studies it, and about where the campaign starts (level 3 is when a Magus would find the sword; But that aside, low level campaigns I understand aren't much fun? DM intends to start level 3-5, so whatever...) is the point in which Gnoll-Magus is just starting to get a hang of learning to wield the magic and sword combo.\n\nSo...\n\nMy Gnoll represents a slightly-civilized Gnoll who is not the tallest/strongest of the bunch. He intends to show to the other Gnolls that power can be gained through intelligence as well as ferocity. \n\nI don't think a regular brutish/barbarian-esque name would be fitting... Ideas?\n\n\n\n(And for those curious how the campaign starts, we [adventuring PCs] will be prisoners in an arena / coliseum... My Gnoll personally is prisoner due to being caught practicing what might be considered \"strange magic\" to Gnoll-kind, speaking of possessed swords and such) ",
