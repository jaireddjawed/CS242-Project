Like some parts seem Sci-fi channel film of the week quality, some parts 80s suspense cheese, then all of a sudden there's a beautiful poignant moment, some incredible artistic shots, &amp; some that seem to use similar old old-school in-camera effects like Coppola used in Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n\nJust Reading IMDB trivia on the production, it seems Coppola was kinda whacked about the film, which he told Val Kilmer he was processing his own son's death through the film. Then later the film was delayed because Coppola was trying to pioneer a non-linear, somewhat interactive deliver method for the film - an idea that they could not make practical.\n\nHe produced it through his American Zoetrope, small artistic film that morphs genres and tone.   It struck me as an enigmatic film.",

        "text": "I recently watched Mulholland drive for the second time - a mix of unconsciously and consciously i attempted to create a diagram of how i thought the characters, archetypes, and experiences within Diana's dream convert to her real life. \n\n\\- The director being forced to choose Camila, when he clearly wanted to choose Diana, or Naomi; was a manifestation of both Diana's jealousy over Camila being casted as the lead instead of her, and her narcissism that she's the better actor, that she rightful deserves the role and the director can clearly see it - but outside beings and forces are pressuring him to choose Camila \n\n\\- The scene where the hitman kills three people like an ultraviolent looney toon episode was a manifestation of Diana still feeling for Camila; her wishing that the hitman was too incompetent to kill her and would fail.\n\nEven if an aspect of her dreams aren't a direct manifesation of Diana's life or emotions: there's almost always a link between her dream and real life. For example the outside force compelling the director to cast Camila being a cowboy on a ranch doesn't have any specific meaning beyond the fact that Diana saw the cowboy at Adam's dinner party.\n\nBut I'm stumped on the homeless woman. She never appears in Diana's real life, and she doesn't seem to have an exact reason for existing. \n\nAfter the identity of the man in the diner (in real life) is revealed to be an accomplice of the aforementioned hitman (or at least i assume he was since he seemed to be with the hitman) , i came to the conclusion that the diner scene was another manifestation of Diana hoping that the hitman would fail - the woman killing the accomplice represents an act of god saving Camila. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that didn't sit right with me, because what about the final scene where she sticks the bluebox in the paper bag, or when she stares at the camera after Diana's death?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has some thoughts on the meaning behind her inclusion id love to hear them",

I think it’s won me over. I love that these other countries didn’t have the Hayes Code, so you see serious content and themes in older movies, but still in good taste. Nights of Cabiria couldn’t have been made in USA in the ‘50s. Or Wild Strawberries or maybe even Bicycle Thieves; the latter is too dark and naturalistic, and the guy goes to an Italian Communist Party office to help him find a bike at one point.\n\nAnyone else feeling this preference for foreign films? Any favourites or preferred genres? I really like Italian neo realism, French New Wave, and some of Ingmar Bergman’s work. \n\nI gotta say too, Umberto D by Vittorio de Sica is basically a manifesto for giving people reasons to live. That might be my absolute favourite along with Cabiria and Wild Strawberries.\n\nThis point is pretty all over the place, but I just have all these thoughts I haven’t been able to share!",

The Whale is based off of a play and uses several great techniques to keep you engaged all the while the whole movie takes place only in his house.\n\n2. It features Brendan Fraser who was blacklisted from Hollywood due to sexual assault allegations, and honestly he’s the comeback kid you need to support this season.\n\n3. It touches on many themes included trauma, loss of a loved one, homophobia, fat phobia, and more. The themes are intertwined in a way that make the viewing very raw. Sometimes uncomfortable, but honestly True Films are supposed to make you feel things, and this one certainly does.\n\n4. You’ll probably be entertained by Avatar, but you’ll be cathartically enraptured by The Whale.\n\n5. Supporting smaller films is good, because the main stream ones overshadow and get more visibility.\n\n6. A common reaction to the film is “It’s my favorite movie, hands down.” And “I’ve never cried like that during a movie.” If you love very well written and emotional sequences, this movie is for you. Avatars scenes are predictable and the tale has been told before. \n\n7. Avatar will leave you with a feeling of repetition and the feeling that you’ve seen the movie already - The Whale is a totally unique experience. \n\n—-\n\nPersonal take: The fat suit at some points is noticeable, only in the hands for me. I was never focused on this piece of it and only was interested in the character development. My own parents struggle with obesity, and while they aren’t 600lbs, my dad does struggle with congenital heart disease and had a heart attack about 7 years ago. I think that the struggle with depression presents itself very differently to different people, and that’s also what this movie is about. It’s about people dealing with loss in different ways. The sister/care taker played by Hong Chau swings wildly between enabling Charlie to literally eat himself today to mildly abusive behavior, even hitting him after he choked on a piece of meatball sub that SHE gave him. Yet I found myself empathizing with her too - someone completely estranged by the religious community and having no one but her adopted brothers partner. \n\nI found myself relating to Charlie’s constant apologizing - it’s a common thing that people with a lot of empathy do. They take blame onto themselves. In a way, I think the whale and his body is a literal representation of the pain bodies of him and everyone around him.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

The weird side conflict with Tobey Maguire's character and the mob just feels unnecessary when Nellie and Manny can meet their career ends in a similar way without dragging the plot for an extra half-hour.\n\nAnd because of that tangent, characters like Sidney and Fay Zhu get mostly sidelined, departing without the opportunity to truly examine their emotional climaxes like the other ensemble characters got. I honestly found their characters struggles with bigotry as Hollywood begins to chafe under the Hays Code more interesting than Nellie's arc by the end of the picture.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you feel that the ensemble's screentime was balanced well, or do you feel that the pacing and structure of the movie ended up feeling lopsided?",

        "text": "TL;DR: that stutter you’re seeing during the IMAX HFR presentation of AVATAR THE WAY OF WATER is the 24 frames per second footage post converted using duplicated frames to 48 frames per second.\n\nAnyway, if you decide to read further, enjoy my rant! There are no spoilers here.\n\n—------------------------------------\n\nAfter seeing AVATAR THE WAY OF WATER in HFR IMAX yesterday, I’ve had some lengthy discussions and rants with people about the implementation of it’s “variable high frame rate”, and thought it might be useful to provide a little explainer on why you're (possibly) seeing a stutter during those 24 frame per second scene and why IMO it was a wrong technical choice.\n\nFirst off to those unaware (probably not many), HFR in 3D theatrical presentations is nothing new. To this day, you still hear people arguing about its merits on films like THE HOBBIT series (48fps), GEMINI MAN (60fps) and Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (120fps). For me though, I never hated HFR 3D presentations. Does it have a soap opera effect? Sure. Does it feel disconnected from the visual language of film? A bit I guess. But does that bother me? Not really. I’ve always found 3D to be an enjoyable filmmaking gimmick, and having HFR of either 48 to 120fps just makes that gimmick more effective in its overall presentation. And if I decided I don’t want to watch a film in 3D, I just won’t watch it in 3D. Thankfully there are more options available now than there ever were 10 years ago for non 3D films.\n\nHowever, there is a large difference worth noting with AVATAR THE WAY OF WATER’s HFR implementation, as it’s using a “variable” high frame rate, with scenes “presented” at 48fps and 24fps. I say “variable” and “presented” as that’s where audiences have kind of been told a lie.\n\nWhen it comes to AVATAR TWOW’s HFR presentation, the native frame rate of the master is entirely 48fps, and during that presentation, the 48fps footage is properly displayed natively. However, it’s a different story for the 24fps footage, which has to undergo a post conversion technique to re-interpret that footage into a 48fps.\n\nSo for example, let's say you have 1 second of footage at 24 frames per second (1-24):\n\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24\n\nTo properly conform that footage into a 48fps sequence, you need to re-interpret those 24 frames to 48 frames. Otherwise if left the same, those 24 frames would only equal out to a  half a second of footage at 48fps. This would cause some serious technical issues overall.\n\nThere are two ways to approach this conversion. The first being motion interpolation which generates a new intermediate frame between each of the 24 frames. However, this process is more in line with creating media that emulates native 48fps footage, and not really representative of the 24fps presentation that AVATAR TWOW wants to showcase.\n\nSo the post conversion technique the film has to primarily use is to convert the 24fps footage into a 48fps using duplicated frames:\n\n1a-1b-2a-2b-3a-3b-4a-4b-5a-5b-6a-6b-7a-7b-8a-8b-9a-9b-10a-10b-11a-11b-12a-12b-13a-13b-14a-14b-15a-15b… and so on.\n\nThis is how you’re viewing the 24fps footage in AVATAR TWOW HFR 48fps presentation. At the end of the day it’s cheated to be 48fps. \n\nFirst I will say that the native 48fps footage does actually look fantastic. It still has qualities that many complain about with HFR presentations, but the life that it brings to the 3D (specifically the water scenes) is awesome.\n\nThe same can’t be said for the 24fps footage though and it’s shocking that a 250 million dollar film chose this approach. Personally, I found it so distracting that I was close to walking out an hour in. I am glad to have stuck it out as there is more consistent native 48fps footage later on, and some genuinely good story beats. However, when the 24fps footage comes in and out (sometimes within seconds of each other in the same scene) it really yanks you out of the film with this intense frame stutter.\n\nThe issue behind this stutter is in how 24fps treats motion, more specifically motion blur, as 48fps and 24fps capture on screen motion entirely differently. The addition of extra frames during less static 24fps scenes creates a constant stutter, which is only further exacerbated when there is either extreme quick motion or extreme slow motion happening. This is because those extra frames are unnaturally slowing down what is supposed to be a rapid action, beyond what was originally captured. Some scenes closer to the end are the worst offenders, with 24fps speed ramped footage appearing as if it’s lagging due to what feels like a buffering issue.\n\nIt’s worth noting what Cameron himself has even said about the technical process in an interview with variety:\n\n“Can theatres support variable frame rate, switching back and forth within the movie between 24fps and 48fps? The answer is no, they just run it at 48fps. In any part of the scene that we want at 24fps, we just double the frames. And so, they actually show the same frame twice, but, but the viewer doesn’t see it that way. And so, we just we’re essentially using a simple hack to use the high frame rate platform that already exists.”\n\n[https://variety.com/2022/film/news/james-cameron-simple-hack-high-frame-rate-avatar-the-way-of-water-1235394544/](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/james-cameron-simple-hack-high-frame-rate-avatar-the-way-of-water-1235394544/)\n\nBased on a fair amount of comments I’ve seen and discussions I've had, I would argue Cameron is wrong on audiences not seeing an issue. What’s worse is it actually does make criticisms about the HFR “gameplay” appearance much more understandable. There were times in which it felt like you were watching a pre-rendered cutscene (struggling) to run at 24fps, right before cutting to gameplay footage running at 60fps. \n\nI do wonder though if this might be a situation where Cameron is trying to make a bad situation work out for the best, and maybe due to budget constraints he was not allowed to finish a full 48fps version. It’s worth noting that HFP is not cheap for productions, especially when you consider the expense of 3D rendering and compositing a 3+ hour movie at 48fps vs 24fps. Even some VFX assets used in a few 48fps scenes are noticeably not 48fps and have an odd stutter when there shouldn’t be any. Taking into account that Cameron has said the film needs to earn 2 billion to break even, maybe this was a cost cutting measure. I sure hope this is the case, as it is frustrating to think an experienced filmmaker thought that this cheat was an acceptable technique to use.\n\nIn the end, I hope variable high frame rate presentations don’t become a thing, and hopefully articulating WHY it looks this way might help others understand what they're seeing. Though it’s also possible that the majority of people never noticed this that much or possibly even cared. There are still a large number of people that have motion smoothing turned on their TV (even with filmmaker mode) and express how much they like it, while others notice no difference on their 65 inch televisions when it’s showing a stretch 4:3 SD picture. Maybe technical standards don’t matter much any longer and I’m just Grandpa Simpson yelling at a cloud.",

        "text": "**Looper** was one of the films that I recall with fondness, simply because it was both unpredictable and well-written despite its complicated, non-chronological storytelling. From that point on, I knew Rian Johnson was a director to watch. \n\nHe followed this excellent film with the first **Knives Out** mystery, and also hit that one out of the park, featuring a more grounded Southern Poirot in Benoit Blanc. It was also a masterpiece of detection, featuring a brilliant mystery. \n\n**Glass Onion** is no less scintillating. A group of friends were invited to an island by their eccentric billionaire buddy, Miles Bron. Somehow, Benoit Blanc also ended up being invited as well, to figure out a murder mystery. He initially deduces that Miles will be threatened, as all of his friends have reason to do away with him yet despite that are hanging on his provenance. \n\nI think it's high praise for Johnson that this film reminded me of Park Chan-wook's **Handmaiden**, especially with respect to its unraveling. Just when the viewer thinks that the plot is just Blanc solving the murder mystery on the island, Johnson deftly unleashes an overarching story enveloping the initial mystery, similar to Handmaiden retelling the story again, but with new details the second time around.\n\nIt's just like peeling an onion. However, unlike **Knives Out**, resolving the whodunit is not as difficult, because it's all shown in the film. However, all I could figure out was who weren't the killers, as there wasn't enough evidence for me to exonerate three people. \n\nHighly inventive and, again, masterfully written, Glass Onion is one of the best films of 2022 with remarkable performances from Janelle Monae and Daniel Craig. \n\n9/10",

For the majority of the runtime, his films are pretty normal and just full of dry irony and humour with some short surrealist sequences here and there.

I thought maybe I was being a contrarian and just wanted to pick fights over popular movies. Then I saw Bardo....\n\nNot only was this movie all about how his Hollywood Oscar-bait movies were just Oscar bait but it was far more personal than those other two films. Bardo weaves a wild Fellini-esque tale about a director unsure of his career, unsure of his family, and unsure of his culture as a whiter Mexican living between his homeland and Los Angeles. It's almost like a Spanish \"Knight of Cups (Terrence Mallick)\".\n\nMy question is: Why is this film not being talked about? It was probably the most interesting film of the 2020's so far by a very successful director. I'd love to hear anybody's thoughts on this movie if you've seen it and if you haven't please go to the theaters to check it out.\n\nMy opinion: This movie takes aim directly at Hollywood, America, Mexico and at progressive political culture. Basically calling it all out for their collective political hypocrisies. this isn't my interpretation this is all directly from the movie. I think this film rings so true it's uncomfortable for audiences and the Hollywood establishment. I want to dive into his earlier work hoping to find similar humanity.",

Some examples: the asylum in *Session 9*, the house in *The Haunting*, the forest in *Princess Mononoke*. These settings usually scaffold our emotional memory of the film or show, creating lasting impressions and a sense of having experienced a place we've never been (I've never been to L.A., but I feel like I have a memory of it from Michael Mann's *Collateral*), or come to know a fictitious one (New Zealand-as-Middle Earth). Cities, especially, can create a powerful form of this kind of saudade. \n\nSo, what film or show's portrayal of a city would you consider particularly memorable? \n\nP.S. Please be specific. 'Gotham', for example, has been the primary setting of all the versions of Batman, but for me *The Animated Series* Gotham is the one I have the most powerful sense of being 'Gotham'.

There were some peaks and very powerful emotional moments, but they were sandwiched by bad pacing and poor balance. I mean, the film really slows down in the middle where we watch the kids predictably deal with the bullies in the new village (as usual) and interact with the sea animals. So, there is a lot of air and room to breathe. Then for the next hour, the film barely gets any chance to breathe as it's nonstop action like we're all too used to with modern blockbusters. A lot is happening while, at the same time, not much is happening. \n\nThe first movie executed a classical story very well and mostly everything else felt fresh--the world, the visuals, the characters, some concepts. Here, there's a lot of familiar. They even had to cheaply bring back an established villain. Couldn't even commit to a new villain. Lang's character predictably has a son (OF COURSE) who conveniently factors in as a plot point that conveniently drives the story and dynamics. Also, Spider's acting is just really, distractingly bad. He's just yelling lines basically without much sincere emotion that's felt. \n\nAnyway, the first film had great pacing with memorable setpieces and natural flow of the plot that continually moved the story along. There is really not a lot that's happening in this film. It's even more simple, and a lot of the setpieces felt boring and uninspired compared to Cameron's usual setpieces and vision. Of course, the visuals were drop-dead gorgeous, and the music was beautiful as to be expected. Mostly everything else felt flat for me unfortunately. \n\nWhat did you guys think?",

How do you evaluate the elements like writing and editing? What makes dialogue good or bad? What even constitutes a good story? Who decides what is good and bad cinematography? Why do some things resonate with the public and other things don’t. Why is there often a disagreement between critics and the general public about whether a movie was good or bad? How could there be an objective standard when intuition and personal baggage is such a huge part of whether you like a piece of art?",

        "text": "To me this film was Jordan Peele making his mark on the moviemaking industry with a subtle statement that due to his critical success &amp; accumulated technical acumen that he will henceforth be acting as a gatekeeper of sorts for cultural (particularly African-American) filmmaking to those looking for success in the moviemaking industry.\n\nBeing that he is a comedian this is one of the only merits to the film that I could find seeing as how this concept made me LOL. \n\nGathering from conceptual knowledge of his last two films it was nearly undeniable to me that this film would speak to racial matters in some capacity. The inclusion of Steven Yeun in this film kind of confirmed it to me seeing as how I noticed he was placing non-white actors in traditionally white roles &amp; settings. \n\nI also picked up on Marcus Garvey “back to Africa” tones scattered throughout he film &amp; found that it seems like Jordan Peele doesn’t have a lot of confidence in African American directors in the new decade. \n\nGoing into the film I thought it’d be an ingenious cultural identity type of comedy that exposed or highlighted cultural norms or nuances of the African-American community, but when I didn’t get that is when I started picking the film apart for what Peele was really saying here.\n\nAs to why it was so revered by moviegoers and critics alike, I blame spectacle itself as putting most audience members in a sort of stupor trying to make sense of this film. There isn’t a lot to draw back on if you’re unfamiliar with Jordan Peele’s work in the first place, so I could understand the prevailing thought that this is a “great” director capitalizing on the success of his two prior films. But those who’ve studied film &amp; filmmaking know this simply isn’t the case. \n\nI’m curious as to if anyone’s read any reviews with serious commendations to any of the aspects of Peele’s film here because I agree with OP in saying that there wasn’t much here to love about this movie.",

        "text": "It's a great film in its own right of course. A great comedy first and foremost because there are plenty of laughs to be had. Verbal as well as physical comedy done right and mostly hanging on the shoulders of the wonderful John Candy. Steve Martin makes for a nice straight-guy character of course.  But the execution of emotion in a primarily comedy film made for a nice surprise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe film benefits from its bare premise of the 2 dudes trying their best to get to their families for Thanksgiving. So we are given the emotional hook very early on and there is a very natural desire in us to see Steve Martin back with his family. Credit to the filmmakers for exercising restraint in showing Martin's family at their home. We got a few short glimpses of them waiting Martin and nothing more. Why go for cheese when the stage has been set?\n\nSo our focus remains on the 2 lead characters played by Martin &amp; Candy. This plays out like we expect a (air, rail &amp;) road trip to go like. There are plenty of bumps and hurdles along the way and every few minutes there is a hilarious situation arising out of the mess. We all can relate having a journey with someone we were uncomfortable with. The dialogue and situational comedy is all very very good I feel. John Candy is the MVP here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not just for comedy purposes. Candy is the soul of the film too. Candy brings sincerity &amp; earnestness to his role. A very affable &amp; lovable persona. His actions on the other hand continually cause messes. But this is where the film shows its strength. The bond between Candy &amp; Martin grows as does their chemistry that we are left wanting more of them together by the end. We start out seeing Candy as the antagonist to the protagonist's goal of reaching his family. We end hoping to see Candy &amp; Martin spend thanksgiving together because having learned of Candy's wife, our perception of him completely changes if it hadn't earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I call it potent is because a pleasant comedy movie got a few tears out of me as it ended. It was  a wonderful tribute to Thanksgiving tradition if you will, where a stranger is invited over to dine with family &amp; celebrate the occasion.  As Roger Ebert notes in his review linked below, it is all because of empathy. Candy exhibits empathy right from the start and is a much more understanding, supportive fellow. Whereas Martin is impatient, cold, riles up easily &amp; just tense overall. But by the end Martin displays great empathy in return. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn Hughes wrote a terrific screenplay as this all is done and dusted in 92 minutes. The movie could have easily gone into more hijinks and laughs and may have been equally fun. But it had to focus on the heart aspect of the story which makes it a better piece of art and hence PTA has stood the test of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-planes-trains-and-automobiles-1987](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-planes-trains-and-automobiles-1987)",

        "text": "This article includes a lot of film stills. If you would like to see the illustrated version click here- [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/the-incredibly-strange-creatures-who-stopped-living-and-became-mixed-up-zombies/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/the-incredibly-strange-creatures-who-stopped-living-and-became-mixed-up-zombies/)\n\nThe main problem with *The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies* is the title. The title is comical, and so sets you up to expect something funny, but *The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies* is something different. Something rare. There are plenty of “so bad it’s good” films in the world, but this one is “so bad it’s special.” It has a balance of skill and lack thereof that is unique. \n\nIt was made by schlock auteur Ray Dennis Steckler in 1964. He was living in his car at the time, but managed to raise $38,000 to make the film. Every penny of it went to the movie, and as a result, he almost starved to death during production.\n\n*The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies* certainly has elements of your standard drive-in horror crap, but as the movie picks up momentum, it creates its own aesthetic and mood. Many films try to be surreal and fail. They just end up being weird instead of unnerving. Steckler tries his ham-fisted hand at it, and somehow, through some unintended alchemy, his efforts at surrealism become surreal in themselves. He stumbles upon a delicate balance of bad acting, random filler, and some inept editing to create a strange nonsensical cohesion between unrelated images. It’s a forced association that captures the disorienting absurdity of true surrealism. \n\nIt has been called one of the worst films ever made, and it was lampooned on *Mystery Science Theater 3000*, but, if before letting you watch it, you were told that it was written and directed by [**David Lynch**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/favorite-scenes-%E2%84%9617-mulholland-drive/), I wouldn’t be surprised if you came out of the theater impressed. It’s a little like the thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters thing, but in this scenario, it’s a thousand Stecklers.\n\nThe plot is relatively simple. Angela, a “good girl” with an impressive bouffant, is dating Jerry, a somewhat “bad boy” that her mother doesn’t approve of. The happy couple go to a carnival together, where they encounter Carmelita, the swarthy “gypsy woman”, who sings in the variety show. Carmelita and Jerry exchange smoldering stares, and then things start getting a little odd. Carmelita seems to be part of a strange plot to hypnotize poor Jerry and turn him into a murderer. She is in league with a rogue’s gallery of misfits who are torturing and killing people for no apparent reason.  \n\nThis dangerous group of oddballs is just plopped into the film without any explanation. \n\n We learn nothing about their motivations or who they are, but it works to Steckler’s advantage. The group seems too arbitrary and cartoonish to be real, leaving us to wonder if they only exist in Jerry’s head. It feels as if the chaos and abandon of the carnival has sent Jerry spiraling into madness. It all transpires inside a theater, a classic symbol of the psyche, and as we are in a theater, there are plenty of curtains that can be dramatically thrust aside to reveal something shocking. Curtains can be a cheap substitute for a set, but they can also be symbols for sublimation and hidden trauma.\n\n*The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies* is a bit like a psychedelic version of *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.* Both Jerry and Conrad (The main character in *Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*) are forced to become murderers against their will. Both men are tortured by confusion and dissonance, and both films use a carnival as a “colorful”, ever-moving backdrop.\n\nWhen Jerry is in his hypnotic trance, Steckler indulges in manic montages mixing images of the carnival rides, people's faces, expressionistic ballet sequences, and the obligatory spinning spiral to convey Jerry’s turmoil and confusion. As an added bonus, when *The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies was* shown in theaters, Steckler arranged for actors in masks to run through the aisles whenever the hypnotic spiral appeared on screen.\n\nIn this messy exchange of images, a wide variety of associations surface. Jerry is overwhelmed by the exotic sexuality of this mysterious, otherworldly woman. He is irresistibly drawn to the untamed darkness of the cult and the carnival. The innocent Angela tries to reach him, but the pull toward the forbidden is too great.\n\nThe film begins with Angela caught between her desire for Jerry, the bad boy, and the quiet life of suburban propriety, but it is ultimately Jerry who is caught between the two worlds. Despite her ambivalence, Angela ends up being the only thing keeping Jerry from abandoning the safety of the middle-class American dream and sinking into depravity.\n\n[**Surrealism**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/three-movements-three-adjectives-surreal-absurd-magic-realist/) is about letting the irrational and emotional loose. It made sense in the 1920s, and it made sense again in the 1960s. In the 1920s, the surrealists were reacting to the horror of World War I. They felt society was fooling itself by believing it was rational. The 1960s were marked by a similar illusion. America believed white privilege, mass production and consumerism would save the country, but Vietnam and the draft changed all that.\n\n*The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies* does not have “incredibly strange creatures”, and the “zombies” aren’t really zombies. The unexplained cabal just reads as a dark force preying on consumers’ curiosity. The carnival sideshow offers something exotic and sexual that threatens to destroy those who indulge in it.\n\nLayered on top of this Freudian dynamic are the stage acts. We see the series of trashy lounge acts offered to the masses. The spectacle is meant to be enticing, but Steckler shows us behind the scenes to expose its shoddy underpinnings. We even see backstage, where one of the actresses is repeatedly chastised for making mistakes in her dance routine. When she is on stage, the camera cuts to the disapproving face of the boss as he watches her in the wings. \n\nThe lack of talent and showmanship on the stage hints at the emptiness of our own illusions and rationalizations. To be clear, Steckler probably included the dance numbers just to fill screen time, but the result is something eerie. It’s almost like a self-parody. Steckler billed the film as “the first horror musical”, which it isn’t. Including footage of a few stage acts doesn’t constitute a musical, but it probably sold tickets.\n\n*The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed-Up Zombies* is a bad movie with a bad title made by a bad director, but the lack of craft opens a space for strange things to happen. Whether it is a success or a failure, the film touches on something unique.",

I know Ron Howard isn’t really known for having a signature style, but in nearly every scene, the camera either moves or is positioned in an off-kilter, wonky way, and I think that actually works in tandem with the heavily stylized sets and costumes, and overall the movie has more of a Seuss-ey vibe to it than, *I think* any other big screen adaptation of the books. Even during certain shots that I imagine would otherwise be static, the camera rocks or wobbles about. I struggle to meaningfully describe it beyond that, but I do get a sense of the fantastical nature of Whoville and Mount Crumpit.\n\nI could be way out on a limb here. I suppose the counterargument would just be that the movie either is hyperactive or acts gimmicky because it’s so afraid of losing the audience. I’m only slightly better than I used to be at parsing what a movie does or doesn’t do well, so this could be one big crackpot misinterpretation. But is there anything you notice looking at any of these movies, even if the movie itself doesn’t hold up overall? Something about the story, interesting symbolism, attention to detail, or beyond? Or do these movies simply not have that much to offer?",

I'm not expecting action comedies to have an *intelligent* plot, per se, but I'm expecting the action to be exciting, the writing to be funny, and the story to, well, *exist.*\n\nThe villains literally have no stated motivations at all. The main family we follow is full of characters so flat that calling them two-dimensional would be undeserved praise. I bought a ticket to see a violent Santa Claus go full Rambo, yet the film spends so much time on whether this young girl's parents are going to get divorced and it's just...why did you take this interesting and unique premise and bog it down with a complete lack of excitement or humour?\n\nThe film just takes itself way, *way* too seriously and sincerely. There are a few moments where it feels like David Harbour and John Leguizamo are about to really ham out, but the film is never self-aware enough to say \"yeah this plot premise is insane\" and fully embrace the cheese.\n\nAnd putting aside the weak writing and direction, the sound mix is just god-awful; I don't understand why modern films have no clue how to balance dialogue and sound effects so both can be heard clearly. Match that with lackluster action setpieces compared to 87North's origins behind *John Wick* and *Atomic Blonde*, and it's just a really disappointing movie overall.\n\nThis movie went from theatres to streaming pretty quickly, so I wonder how other people feel about it. Did you get much enjoyment out of this flick?",

        "text": "If Netflix wants to lure people towards their movie collection, AQONTWF is an excellent example. A lot of NF movies have lacked cinematic flair. Even their big budget pictures like Red Notice, Gray Man, Don't Look Up look and sound unremarkable. Imho, Scorsese's Irishman is one of his tamer pictures in recent years as far as technical are concerned.\n\nAQONTWF is perhaps the first time I was in awe of a NF distributed film. Right from the get go the look and feel of the movie is established and it invokes a vibe of a big budget traditional studio epic meant for the cinemas. While watch Western Front I often felt like I was watching a Ridley Scott movie given the color tones, saturation and the way it was shot.\n\nSome look at the visuals of the film:\n\n1) https://reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/yqjh05/all_quiet_on_the_western_front_2022/\n\n2) [Opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyv1Yn2CWeo)\n\n3) https://reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/z6x19f/all_quiet_on_the_western_front_2022/\n\n\n\nThe use of music has to be appreciated as well. The movie employs music efficiently leaving plenty of moments behind where no music is played. This is something I wish more movies would do, to not use music as a crutch as often. Lack of music allowed us to get a more raw, natural feel of the characters thrown within the chaotic situations.\n\nSpeaking of getting close to the characters, this is perhaps the main goal of the movie. To put you in the footsteps of these young kids off to fight in the war. There have been plenty of war movies that focus on exactly this aspect. Recently a big success was Sam Mendes' *1917* (2019) a brilliant picture in its own right. But in comparison to this, 1917 felt too hung over its one take factor. That hung like a cloud over the film and the fact that it takes place over the course of a few days and following only 2 characters restricted its scope. Other war epics often prioritize the spectacle over the drama.\n\nAQONTWF goes into the mundaneness of the life of a soldier in WW1. The kind of food they eat, where they shit, how difficult it is to often find food, loneliness, missing family &amp; home, thinking about future after the war, what a handkerchief worn by a young women means to the soldiers etc. These things give you a closer insight into the lives of the soldiers than perhaps any WW movie ever made. There are 2 scenes in the movie where all that we are shown is that a soldier is asked to pick up the identity badges of the fallen comrades. The movie gives a good few minutes both times and the weight of each picked up badge is felt. This is filmmaking done right.\n\nBut AQONTWF isn't just about the on field matters. As we know, real war is played between officers and officials who hold the power to decide the matters. Daniel Bruhl's character isn't featured a lot but is very effective. The egos and ignorance of the people in power is well portrayed. There are a noticeable shots focusing on food. The kind of foot and cutlery the officers use and what the soldiers get to eat.\n\nThe presentation of this side of the story, of the higher officers and officials, was necessary to provide a contrast and for it all to fit together.\n\nAQONTWF feels like a complete war film, spanning a significant time. The touch of politics adds to the quality. The technical aspects such as the cinematography, production design, score &amp; editing all spectacularly support the narrative and combine together to form one of the best films of the year and a worthy addition to the pantheon of war films.\n\n**Rating: 9/10**",

        "text": "Mary Poppins, Space Jam, Osmosis Jones.  All live action/animated hybrid movies, but they don't *really* blur the lines between them as the live action and the animation are very visibly separate. Then there are motion capture animated movies such as Beowulf and The Adventures of Tintin. These are clearly animated films but deserve a mention as the making of them blurred the lines between animated and live action filmmaking to some degree. Next up, live action films that are very heavily CGI, with often fully animated backgrounds. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was the first one and Sin City and 300 soon followed, among others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I am really interested in are the latest steps of this evolution:\n\n\\- Avatar: 60% CGI, with tons of fully CGI scenes which despite being fully CGI were perceived as live action\n\n\\- Gravity: 80% CGI, in most scenes *everything* is computer generated except for Bullock's face.\n\n\\- The Lion King: fully CGI, except for the opening shot. Sure, most view this as an animated film, but it's the most photorealistic fully animated film yet\n\n\\- Avatar: The Way of Water: 80% CGI according to Cameron. This is the first movie ever that I believe proves that it is now possible to make a completely photorealistic fully CGI movie.\n\nWhich movies do you think have blurred the lines between animation and live action the most so far? Have I left out anything significant? Where do you see this synergy between live action and animation headed?",

The only thing that I have passion for is film, the only thing keeping me alive at this point. However, I've fallen into some sort of crisis that has made me start to overthink and bug me 24/7. Which is if film is actually what I'm passionate about or I just don't know what to do with my life. First, I'll start off with what started this all which happened around sometime last spring. I began to look more into how to appreciate film and better analyze or review one. I still have trouble trying to get my thoughts out on how I feel about a film but can definitely tell the difference between good one and a bad one, just not explain how very well. All I saw just made me more overwhelmed. I saw posts about looking into the IMBD trivia or reading about the BTS on a film on Wikipedia. I started to do this and other things but felt as if watching movies began to be a chore. Instead, now I just correlate me thoughts into a sentence or two, but I don't think this I'll help me better analyze a film or understand it's themes/messages. How could I get better at this? \n\nSecond, I still have tons of movies to watch that I feel I need to. I started going by a director's filmography and watching all their movies to see how they compare from each other. I don't know why but doing this has made me more scared to watch movies from directors like Martin Scorsese or David Lynch. I just feel like I'm too dumb enough to appreciate their films and understand them. I don't want that kind of mentality when choosing which movies/directors to watch and don't know what to do. How do I get out of this mentality? Also, I want to get into Criterion but don't know how. My public library has tons of movies from the Criterion Collection, but I feel like I don't know where to start.  Any advice?\n\nThird, is film school helpful? I've never used a big movie type camera, nor do I know anyone in the industry. I've made tons of home movies with family and friends and even wrote a short screenplay which I plan to film later this spring. I do alright in school and slightly looked into films schools. If your somebody who used too or still lives in the lower middle class and went to film school, which one did you go to? As well as which ones are considered the best and worth taking out loans to get the most out of it? People who didn't go to film school and work in the film industry, how did you get there? \n\nBased off of what I told you, do you think I should continue to pursue film? \n\nThank you to those who responded! I really appreciate it.",

I found the fart jokes completely unfunny, the satire overly obvious, the color scheme drab and unappealing.

It's ZZ-grade. (That isn't a typo - the dialogue is so bad its gone round the clock twice.)  \"Does it look like I have 'cunt' written on my forehead?\" Yes, an actual line from the film. One of the better ones actually. At least it's **so** shit it's kinda funny. And memorable. Most of the lines are so shit they're...just shit.\n\nTo add to this, for a film with such a crazy premise, the action is actually pretty standard. Guy shoots at guy, guy dodges, guy shoots back. I mean, woah. The kind of scenes you instantly forget, even in a film with a narrative you care about, which this isn't. The bit at the end where he's falling out of a plane and makes a phone call is kinda funny, and almost makes it seem like this film might be kind of self aware, but when the lead hits the roof of a car, bounces up into the air (yes, bounces), lands on the concrete, opens his eyes, and some BADASS ROCK MUSIC kicks in with the credits, you realise it was only a momentary, fleeting realisation that the film might be a bit silly.\n\nBut forget all of that. Silliness can be forgiven. It's the kind of film you put on because you think \"Ahh, this might be a bit silly, time to turn of my brain.\" Well, forget that. It you have any kind of standard for film or moral compass, you will not relax at all. Instead you will be invigorated by pure rage that this film has 61% on Rotten Tomatoes. Why? Because the worst aspect of this film is it's mean spirited attitude. To women, to violence, to sex, and to the general public.\n\nWomen - At one point the female lead is quivering and crying and screaming and generally being a hysterical WOMAN (that's what women are like in times of crisis, right?) that Jason Statham literally picks her up like the object she is (she remains rigid to reinforce this idea) and hoists her into a car. Problem solved.\n\nViolence - Statham cuts of a mans hand and 'quips' \"How fucking awesome was that?\" - Answer? Not very. I mean, it doesn't sound that egregious written down, but try and picture it in your head. Statham jumps out of the shadows, chops off a mans hand, and then proclaims it was \"awesome\". How was it awesome? Maybe if you're 15 years old maybe? I'm not sure. I just...don't get it.\n\nSex - I like the bit where he raped the woman and half way through the rape (pleading and screaming and pushing him away while he tried to grab her tits and ass) she decides \"Wait a minute...I like this!\" and starts screaming for him to fuck her. That was a nice. A good message to all the incels and niceguys of the world. If a woman doesn't like something, just keep trying, but harder. She will succumb eventually. \n\nThe general public - The amount of horrible awful things Statham does to people who are in no way his enemy is astounding. In most cases they are simply involved by virtue of standing on the street near where he is doing stuff, yet his character (or the film, depending on how you look at it) treats them with malice, hatred, and scorn, pushing them over, stealing their stuff, shouting in their faces. It seems they are mainly there to be laughed at. Just like people in real life, I guess.\n\nI suppose all of this would be ok if this was the bad guy, but the film clearly wants us to be sympathetic to him. I despair. \n\nTo add to all of that, the number of nonsensical picture-in-picture, split-screen, and super imposed effects make this film look like it was made by a student who just discovered Adobe. But really, that's a minor sin in light of the other things I mention. But still. C'mon guys. Was there no quality control on this thing? Who thought those effects were cool?\n\n-10 stars out of 10. Avoid at all costs. No redeeming features. \n\nAnyway, I'm off to watch Crank 2.",

        "text": "So, today I was watching yet another film that I was not enjoying in the slightest... but I did something different this time, I turned it off. I still appreciate it, I don't think it is bad by any means, I am just not enjoying it; I will probably finish the last half tomorrow just to see where it goes and continue the experience (but mostly because of my OCD and so that I can log it on letterboxd without getting criticized for having stopped a movie because I found it boring). This presented in my mind yet again something I run across almost every time I watch a movie. I find this film extraordinarily boring, but why? I see many people saying it is okay to find a film boring as long as you give a reason why etc. etc. which is odd... you cannot control how you feel. If you are trying to level a criticism to a film, I understand, you should have reasons and arguments, but why do you need to justify your qualia? It justifies itself, or so it seems. What if you cannot give a good reason as to your boredom (we'll come back to this), are you no longer allowed to feel bored? That is obviously absurd. If you want to, it may be useful for multiple reasons to explain why you found it boring, but you do not need to justify your boredom.\n\nMy next problem is when people try to justify why they find a film boring. In fact, this extends to all sorts of 'criticism' of film. Often times (not all the time, there are many examples of criticism that do not fall prey to this) I find that when people share certain aspects of a film that they did not enjoy, or thought was lacking, I can find many examples of films that have this element, let's call it 'x', that they enjoy immensely. They do not, it is important to note, enjoy the film in *spite* of 'x', but often times *because* of 'x'. For example, you may hear people criticise a film for being slow with little to no camera movement... then praise Tsai Ming-Liang, Tar, Ozu, etc. \"Well,\" I hear you saying, \"the slowness in those films work.\" Sure, but then it is still something else about the film that you are disliking. You have no stigma against slow films, it is something else. To then criticize a film due to its slowness without diving in to this deeper aspect is dishonest. It is not the slowness that is the problem, at least not soley, it is something deeper. But even the word 'problem' is problematic. For instance, there are many films I love and many I do not. Stalker is one of my favorites, Mirror is not. Should I have to be able to criticize Mirror to justify the fact that I do not like it? No, that is, as previously stated, absurd. But why then do I like one but not the other? Alot of people, especially on this sub, would try their damndest to find a reason and critique one but uphold the other. No doubt one can do this, and sometimes it may even be justified. But with so many of these great films, maybe there is nothing 'wrong' with this great movie to make you not like it. It just doesn't 'hit' you like that other one does. I love Damnation, but not Werkmeister Harmonies so much... is there something 'wrong' with the latter, do I have a critique to level against it? Absolutely not, it is an astounding film... I just don't feel it. \n\nIt is the same thing with finding a film boring. Why should I feel bad if I find a film boring and turn it off? A City of Sadness and Ran are too slow and boring for me but Stray Dogs, Goodbye Dragon Inn, Uncle Boonmee, and Memoria, while being much much slower, I find riveting. To be told that I am wrong, or that I am not allowed to turn a movie off and do something else, takes away from the enjoyment of cinema quite a lot. Or, you might say that \"it is fine to turn it off etc. you don't need to justify everything, but it may be an interesting exercise to study why one hits but the other doesn't.\" Fair enough. But this very rarely actually works for me. I have no reason why I enjoy one film but not the other (again, I find it hard to believe most film critics do, it seems to be much more of a psychological or philosophical question, reducing it to film criticism seems both arrogant and ignorant). I find elements of cinema that I enjoy and elements that inspire my own work in both the films that I enjoy and the ones that I do not for the most part; again, there are some movies that I have more grounded criticisms of, but my point is that this is not universal.\n\nWhy do I love some Godard moves but hate others that have just as much of a legacy? When I look in to them I find nothing. In fact, I have yet to see *anyone* find anything. The reasons they give tend not to get much below the surface, no matter how deep the analysis is. None of the criticism explains why I love 8 1/2 but don't really like La Dolce Vita. None of the differences between these films really encapsulate the real reason. There is something much much deeper. It is a personal feeling that when put in to criticism gets trivialized at best and is plain lying at worst. You're telling me that you have an actual objective reason why (insert great, loved film you like) is better than (insert great, loved film you hate)? You have a feeling inside of you, a feeling that is mostly indescribable I would say. When put in to words, again, I find there are too many counter-examples to take these so called 'criticisms' seriously. Even when they are just personal preferences (which is much more honest than calling them criticisms) they are often hypocritical. You hate this film bc it has 'x' in it... but you love that movie because it has 'x' in it... There is something deeper, much deeper that is so subjective it cannot claim to be a criticism, but only a preference based off your psychological makeup and all your experiences. I love Breathless but hate Peirot le Fou, do I have an actual reason? No, and I would bet neither do you. \n\nFilm criticism is by no means useless, it still strives to find this indescribable feeling. It is not, however, something objective and true, but much rather like blind people touching and elephant. Tarkovsky uses a beautiful example. Say there was a moment in your life that had a severe emotional impact on you. Re-create exactly for the screen. Will it have the same effect? Not necessarily. There is something so much more poetic and subjective about life, it is almost a gamble if it hits or not. Almost a gamble. We have theories and whatnot that seem to work a bit of the time. But to claim that we can point out why this film is bad but this one is good just seems absurd. It is *so so so* much deeper than that.\n\nI'm not trying to sound rude or pretentious, this is just something that has stressed me out so very much for a long time, so I figured I would ask about it here finally. I am just so confused. This question is twofold. Why am I not allowed to not enjoy movies? I don't enjoy most movies I watch. I respect them, and they change me, and I cry when I think about them and how much they mean to me, but I do not enjoy watching them for the most part. The second part is, has anyone ever given actual reasons why this movie 'hits' but the other one doesn't? It seems too subjective to give this reason to anyone else (unless you happen to find a critic that has similar feelings to you), and far too deep to explain to yourself in words. I don't think we can explain fully what makes one love or hate a piece of art... that is part of the point of art imo, you *can't* explain it in words. That doesn't mean you can't theorize and learn and try to understand... but I feel people go way too far most of the time.\n\nSo, why when I say I disliked a movie is that bad? I don't *have* to justify my dislike of a movie. Its not my job. That being said, it absolutely can be usefull, and I spend countless hours on papers for school talking about what I liked and disliked about a film and writing reviews... and it helps me make my own films and understand film more in general... but it doesn't make me find La'talante less boring. It doesn't open my third eye and be like \"Ah yes, THAT is cinema\"....\n\nThank you for any and all replies!",

        "text": " This article includes a lot of film stills. If you would like to see the illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/noah-baumbachs-interpretation-of-don-delillos-white-noise/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/noah-baumbachs-interpretation-of-don-delillos-white-noise/)\n\nWhen I first heard that Noah Baumbach was making a film version of one of my favorite books, I had the usual mixture of excitement and concern. I was excited to see Don DeLillo’s postmodern novel *White Noise* come to life, but worried that it wouldn’t translate well.\n\nWhen I saw the trailer, it looked like a comedy. I hadn’t thought of *White Noise* as a comedy, but reflecting back on the book, I understood Baumbach’s choice to present the story as a sardonic pastiche. From the very beginning, the dialogue was tinged with an artifice that kept what the characters were saying in postmodern quotation marks. No one talks the way people talk in the film. Everything is delivered with deadpan satire, hinting at the many references under the surface.\n\n*White Noise* can be seen as a highly academic exercise in illustrating the ideas of Baudrillard, Adorno, Foucault, Derrida, semiotics, structuralism, post-structuralism, and a whole host of other college seminar subjects. It does, after all, take place at a college called “College On The Hill,” a signifier containing the signified, so as to construct a humorous redundancy. It could be the opening line to a *Who’s on First* kind of dialogue: \n\nAbbott: “What college do you go to?”\n\nCostello: “The College on the Hill.”\n\nAbbott: “Oh, what college is that?”\n\nBaudrillard’s ideas on simulacrum are threaded throughout the film, but they truly erupt when a “toxic airborne event” is handled by SIMUVAC, who are using the catastrophe as a simulation to see how well they perform. You don’t need to be versed in '60s era French philosophy to enjoy the film, but it helps. It’s actually difficult for me to gauge what the film would look like to someone unfamiliar with Don DeLillo, or the writings he refers to. I suspect that the film would fare well. The absurdity of the world DeLillo creates is recognizable as a satire, whether or not you have read all the prerequisites.\n\nFor me, one of the most interesting ideas presented in both the book and film is the side effect of a psychotropic drug called Dylar. People taking the drug cannot tell the difference between a word and reality. A character explains that just saying “speeding bullet” would send her running for cover. DeLillo imagines a world where semiotics has been turned on its head.  When it comes to comparing the book and the movie, it’s not a matter of one being better than the other. The movie is a successful interpretation of the book and adds aspects that are not possible in literature. There is a sense of timing that only movies can provide. There is also the spectacle of the imagery. Adam Driver stands beneath an ominous black cloud as a *Shell Oil* sign shines through the blackness like a haunted moon. There are also passages in the book that do not translate well into imagery. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the main character goes to see *The Most Photographed Barn in America.* He discusses with a friend how no one can see the barn now that it has become *The Most Photographed Barn in America*. It has become a hollow icon that can no longer be seen for what it is. He looks at the assembled crowd of tourists and says, “They are taking pictures of pictures.” \n\nJust as the book does, the film transforms about halfway through and becomes something closer to a thriller. It’s an awkward transition where laughter gives way to tension, but it is an opportunity to peek behind the spectacle of consumerism and signs and see the gritty fears that drive us all. Although it never occurred to me when reading the book, the movie caused me to think about Woody Allen’s films, especially *Annie Hall* and *Love And Death*. Allen translates the harsh existential angst he saw in Bergman’s films into something more personal and contemporary. He is a Bergman-inspired clown, obsessed with death and addicted to the only distraction that helps: sex.\n\nDeLillo’s main character is equally obsessed with death, but instead of seeking escape through sex, he seeks a kind of intellectual ecstasy by decoding pop culture and imbuing it with transcendent meaning. He and his wife are desperately seeking salvation in the splashy, multi-colored fantasies of consumerism, capitalism, abundance, and dizzy, Disney-esque happiness. \n\n*White Noise* came out in 1985. I read it in 1991, which meant that it still read as a novel set in the “current” time. When I went to see the movie *White Noise* in 2022, I didn’t expect it to be set in “the past,” and was surprised that careful attention had been paid to set it in 1985. *White Noise* is not a timeless critique of western culture or capitalism, it belongs in its context. However, that does not mean it has no relation to where we are now. Certainly “The Airborne Toxic Event” which causes emergency evacuations, lockdowns, and mask-wearing in the film has obvious resonance with the recent pandemic. There was no internet in 1985, no cell phones, and no Trump, but DeLillo’s insights into the American psyche are still revealing. \n\nBaumbach finishes his film with something DeLillo could never have finished with: a large-scale musical number. We watch the credits roll as all the characters dance and sing in the most American and life-affirming of places: the giant-sized grocery store. “Calgon, take me away!” ",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi there,\n\nI'm looking for some recommendations for horror films that are truly terrifying and not just your average horror film. I'm not easily scared by most horror films, but there are a few specific scenes that have really stuck with me and made me feel genuinely uneasy.\n\n[One scene](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/the_poughkeepsie_tapes_nightmare_fuel.jpg) that really scared me was from the film The Poughkeepsie Tapes. It's the scene where the English woman is killed in the Torture Cellar. The shot starts out with a close-up of the woman restrained and gagged, and then the music starts playing and this white, hollow-looking face appears. It turns out to be a mask worn by someone in black spandex, who crawls on all fours towards the woman. The mask is on the back of his head, which gives a really unsettling body horror effect. He then produces a needle-glove similar to Freddy Krueger's knife-glove and proceeds to stab the woman in the neck. It's a truly terrifying scene that has stayed with me since I saw it.\n\nAnother film that really scared me was The Ring. [There's a scene](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1896886/1584x1056/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60;progressive.jpg) where Kayako Saeki has a really frightening expression with her eyes wide open, against a black and dark green background. It's a really creepy image that stuck with me for a long time.\n\nI would also be interested to know if these films fall under the horror subgenre of surreal horror, which often involves the use of dreamlike or surreal elements to create a sense of unease and disorientation in the viewer. It may also incorporate elements of psychological horror, as it can often play with the viewer's perceptions and manipulate their understanding of reality.\n\nI'm interested in finding horror films that are similar to these scenes - ones that are truly unsettling and not just your average horror film. If anyone has any recommendations fo",

        "text": "Please don't take the following post too seriously! I am a neoliberal democrat who is largely ambivalent about the topic at hand and am just curious if anybody else read into the movie like I did! Also **SPOILER ALERT** (although as my boy [Sean Fennessey says](https://twitter.com/SeanFennessey/status/1603082458378866688?s=20&amp;t=R7o7kUSqgE_H9no1N0KcRg), I don't know if you can really spoil this movie)  \n\n\nLarge parts of Avatar 2 came off to me as James Cameron reckoning with 'Cancel Culture' along with the classic Pandoran themes of environmentalism and colonialism that we saw in the previous movie. I know your first reaction is probably to think I'm too online and should get off twitter, but being as outspoken as James Cameron is, and the fact that everyone seems to be quite 'online' these days, I'll hope you'll indulge my argument:  \n\n\n1. **There is a little white boy who wears dreads in this movie to mimic the Navi who have adopted him.**\n\nOk so the white boy having dreads is probably the most controversial point here, as you can argue all day about the validity of *'****Cultural Appropriation****'* and how dreads are not unique to black cultures across history and also how black people have faced discrimination for their hairstyles in America and yada yada yada. \n\n  \nMy point is more that James Cameron, a smart cookie American director who has been working on this movie for 10 years, chose to include the white boy with dreads *knowing* it was provocative and a touchy subject in America, and was doing so because he wanted to illustrate a point about how people should not be afraid to accept races partaking in their culture (as the Navi did), therefore offering up a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) critique of *'****Cultural Appropriation****'*. I understand that this is maybe a 'strawman' argument of cultural appropriation itself, but all the same I think there was intentional provocation from Cameron here.\n\nAlso you can't tell me [this](https://twitter.com/danielgotskillz/status/714904132646113280?s=20&amp;t=R7o7kUSqgE_H9no1N0KcRg) doesn't remind you of that little kid LOL.\n\n2. **There is a whale who gets 'Cancelled'.**\n\nPlease stay with me here. Maybe I was going insane in the theatre, but I genuinely think that the whale got canceled in an eerily similar way to how humans might cancel each other in 2022, wrongfully or not, over stuff like N-word jokes and sexual assault allegations. I understand that animal groups ostracize members all the time, but the way it was done in this movie with the whales somehow being able to talk (why have talking whales? wtf Cameron you had 10 years to come up with a cooler marine space animal) and all agreeing to shun another whale over a singular incident that the whale even apologized about and felt sorry for, gave me strong 'cancel culture' vibes. It just did! I'm sorry!  \n\n\nThe 'canceled' whale also ends up being the hero and saving the day after being redeemed by one of the Navi kids, further pushing Cameron's anti-cancel culture point about how we should not write people off and should give people second chances.\n\n   3. **The villain is shown mercy by white boy with dreads.**\n\nThis point is fairly tame, I just wanted to again point out the recurring theme here of showing compassion and giving people a second a chance, all of which is tying into a broader anti 'cancel culture' narrative. Our Very Evil Villain (who's revenge based motive I thought was the lamest part of the movie) has his life saved by the little white boy with the strongest moral foundation in the movie.  \n\n\nYou can argue that many of these points are part of more abstract themes like **'Compassion', 'Forgiveness', 'Acceptance',** but I hope that I've established enough here that says Cameron was hoping to speak to the current zeitgeist with his themes, as universal as they may seem. I also **do not want to downplay** the other themes, such as the ones to do with Man's relationship to nature, as they are of magnitudes more important.\n\nAs to whether Cameron pulled it off and made compelling points, I can't really say, this writeup was more about establishing whether he did try to tackle contemporary talking points than a critique of them. The movie itself I personally did find lacking, mainly because I found the conflict (10 years just for it to be Jake Sully vs the cloned General again!) really stale. Anyways I'd love to hear all your thoughts, agree with me or not!",

        "author": "OboeMeister",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/zois3x/tár_and_constructed_mythologies/",
        "text": "While many critics have claimed this film is about cancel culture, that narrative is incredibly reductive to the broader themes of the film.\nLydia Tar is presented as an absolute power in the beginning of the movie, in complete control like a conductor who controls an orchestra. She speaks with an air of complete authority, confident and verbose, pulling from a million different references. When a naive but we'll meaning young conductor tries to push back she pounces on his apparent inexperience, using his mention of Varese as an opportunity to prove she knows more. In a brilliant oner that blends Tar's eloquent verbal barbs with the prowess of the direction of the scene. When this scene is shown later in the \"hatchet job\" form, the one take and her verbal performance are mangled, the self she was attempting to present obliterated.\nWe should talk about the self because that is one of the main things this film is about. The films opening narrative thrust is the anticipation of completing Mahler's fifth symphony. While there are many more popular composers within the classical canon, there are few as heavily mythologized as Mahler (probably Wagner, maybe Beethoven). It's hard to explain what exactly I mean, there is something so maximalist and dense about his music, much like Wagner's, that it instills for many a feeling akin to spirituality. This is helped by various factors such as the time Mahler lived in, the height of classical music's social power, and Mahler's own tragic life, which leads to many interpreting his works through the lens of his life, something Tar herself mentions. The main thing to get at though, is that the classical canon is already heavily mythologized, lines are drawn on retrospect to connect everything together in a linear path from Palestrina to Shostakovich. This canon starts to fall apart throughout the 20th century due to the more limited range of music exploding into a thousand styles of impressionist, expressionist, post romantic, serialist, nationalist, avant garde, modernist, post modernist, spectralist, etc. not to mention the popularusic that erupted at that time. Mahler epitomizes this very manufactured mythology, and not only as a composer but as a conductor. Up until Mahler's time the conductor was still not given nearly as much power as they would be after him, and to a degree were still mostly concerned with keeping rhythm, even Mahler's contemporary Richard Strauss, an esteemed conductor, had a fairly straightforward approach to the form. Something about Mahler's more expressive conducting became an inspiration for the idea of the conductor as a translator of the music for the audience.\nTar is aware of this.\nWhen asked in a subtle way to justify her role, her importance, she goes on a long tangent that ends up approximating \"because I understand the music better, I hold the secrets that none else do and only I can deliver them effectively.\" This is her creating her own mythology. She is surrounded by people who have reinforced, and to whom she has reinforced, said mythology until she begins to believe it herself.\nTowards the end when Bernstein talks about how music is how it makes you feel seems so far removed from her esoteric analysis, and this is not to say her analysis are not without value.That is what makes Tar interesting, like many famous artists who were horrible people, she is good at what she does, but the point is that she is too concerned with proving how good she is at what she does that she has lost sight of the reason she loved music in the first place by the time she reached her peak. The tragedy of this film is not her downfall, that was only the predictable results of hubris. No, the real tragedy was an artist who loved art, who become so sebsumed within her own ego that she began to believe that she was the art. It's ironic the one thing she struggled completely at was composition, the part of music requiring pure creation, not interpretation. She uses many lengthy sentences to describe why past music is so important, but I suspect, in part from the VHS of Lenny, the biggest reason is nostalgia and the power nostalgia music can create, and that is where her fixation lies. At one point I believe she refers to music as the closest experience to the divine or something to that effect. In that sense then, she has become a god to herself.\nThis is what jutified all the hypocritical and monstrous things she did, blacklisting Krista and trying to hide the evidence, using her power to gain sexual favors, regularly belittling those she viewed as beneath her, which by the start of the film seemed to be nearly everyone. Because she believed her own mythology she felt free to manipulate others because she was so close to the divine morality was inapplicable to her.\nHowever, it's worth noting this self mythologizing blinded her to the ways in which she was actually being manipulated simultaneously, such as by the cello player who drops her once she has what she wants, nor is she as aware of the way in which her transactional relationships require a transaction from her, leading to mistakes rooted in presumptuousness. However by the end of the film she is reduced to nothing, her self mythology obliterated, and in her humiliation she is forced to see herself unshrouded in the mists of ego. Her experience in the massage brothel forces her to confront how her relationships in exchange for favors have been in no different than choosing a girl from a fishbowl. Her being forced to play with a click track for a gaming convention is brutal in how it reduces her role to that of a visual metronome, unable to at all manipulate time which she talked so much about earlier in the film.\nNow there's is one other big theme this all ties into. Tar is a critique of auteur theory. The film opens with the full credits, showing the full range of people who created it, not letting the audience leave at the end of the movie as they roll. In many ways auteur directors are quite similar to conductors, conductors are even often referred to as \"music directors.\" They orchestrate a large number of people with separate skills to one single goal, and this are similarly mythologized, but as many people through the years have pointed out, are rarely in direct control of every aspect of a film, and disproportionate credit towards them can and frequently does diminish the roles of the countless other artists and workers that create their own works wholly from their own skill. Similarly, conductors tend to be placed in the spotlight and paid disproportionate amounts of money, and a performance's quality is frequently mainly credited towards them. Tar is a great conductor, the film makes that abundantly clear, but what it also makes, especially with the ending, is that the performance can and will go on without her. Though she is able to give many ideas to the musicians as a whole, the musicians ultimately are the ones who's skill are required to realize her ideas, they are the ones with the means of production. And like with any transactional relationships couched in a severe power dynamic, of that sort, she needs them to believe her mythology more than they need her to direct their capabilities.",

        "text": "I just watched **Triangle of Sadness** yesterday. It was the first film I watched since the pandemic started, and while I did laugh at the boorish humor, I never thought that it deserved the Palme d'Or. The film was too heavy-handed and over-the-top, and while I understood many of its messages, such as its upheaval and deconstruction of current social structures, it didn't really cohere well and felt bloated. \n\nOne of the movie's bright points was Dolly de Leon's performance which was clearly deserving of a Best Supporting Actress nod as the one who led a revolution but struggled to sustain it. Other than that, however, it paled in comparison to the meticulous and painstaking construction of **Decision to Leave**. Even **Broker** was less unfocused than it, so I really don't understand why that film won. **Pacifiction** is also better.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same thoughts? I really think it is a weak Palme d'Or.",

        "text": "[I saw and reviewed *Avatar 2*](https://www.popcornflicks.ca/wp/2022/12/16/avatar-the-way-of-water-2022-review/) on opening day, and I was *really* blown away by all the crazy technology that James Cameron was using throughout the movie.\n\nI think it's pretty much indisputable that *The Way of Water* has the best underwater scenes in any Hollywood picture to date; the underwater motion capture combined with the below-water Volume has me convinced I saw living, breathing Na'vi swimming in the ocean with whales on an alien planet. The CGI in this movie is leagues and fathoms beyond anything else animated for the big screen.\n\nI also think Cameron has proven that HFR has a niche with 3D; while there was a bit of an adjustment period to the 48fps framerate, it made the 3D immensely more comfortable to view, especially considering the 192 min run time. My big complaint is that for some reason Cameron intentionally chose to have some scenes hitch down to 24fps for his own aesthetic reasons, which just looked really stuttery and weird after getting the audience visually used to the HFR scenes.\n\nI highly recommend seeing *Avatar: The Way of Water* in a Dolby Cinema or IMAX with a very bright laser projector; the contrast levels during the night scenes had incredible dynamic range, and when most Hollywood pictures use night scenes to cover bad CGI, James Cameron used nighttime for incredibly beautiful bioluminescent settings with alien plants and animals that felt *real*.\n\nHow impactful did you find all the visual elements of *Avatar 2*? I'd love to hear your analysis on the details.",

        "text": "I recently watched Stalker and found it to be a beautiful film, although it’s pacing was really difficult for me to sit through. \n\nWhat motivated this decision? I understand this to be a technique used often by Tarkovsky as noted in Solaris, another film I feel is a near masterpiece also with long droning shots. \n\nI did a little digging and saw his response to a critic who said the same:\n\n‘Officials at Goskino, a government group otherwise known as the State Committee for Cinematography, were critical of the film. On being told that Stalker should be faster and more dynamic, Tarkovsky replied:\n\n“The film needs to be slower and duller at the start so that the viewers who walked into the wrong theatre have time to leave before the main action starts.”\n\nThe Goskino representative then stated that he was trying to give the point of view of the audience. Tarkovsky supposedly retorted:\n\n“I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman.”’\n\nClearly a hill Tarkovsky thought is worth dying on.\n\nWhat are everyone’s thoughts on this?",
