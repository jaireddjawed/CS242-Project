Anyway, we have four stations and each one has a label printer for our vials. Now the computers we use run off a remote server from the main computer in the IT office, and each time our computers are rebooted the \"printers\" revert to the default which isn't a label machine, but an actual printer for faxing insurance etc. \n\n\nAnyway I work with a bunch of older women that only know how to use a computer for work because of conditioning. In the past they've always waited for the IT guy to come in and fix the printer at 10am, which is literally 3 hours after we're supposed to start. So instead, I just go into the devices, change the printer to the label machine and save it.\n \n\nNow every time there is ANY kind of computer/electronic issue (right down to the key fob I have NO control over) people come to me instead of the guy getting paid 70k to sit in his office all day.\n\nAnd that's how I became the unpaid IT guy................",

        "text": "First time posting here, I think this would fit in TFTS.\n\n*Some Background*\nI work for an IT infrastructure company, installing the cables and outlets that make the network work. One of the things our company does is fiber optics. One of the ways we 'terminate' fiber optics is with a fusion splicer - a machine that lines up the fibers to within microns of each other, melts the ends with electricity, and then pushes the ends together and lets the splice cool.\n\n*Players in the story*\n$primes: me\n$boss: my boss\n$oe: employee who is older than me (older employee)\n\nI'm on a day off when $boss calls me. \"Hey $primes, $oe is having problems with the splicer at $educational_institution. Can you pop over and help him out?\" He calls me because I consistently have the most success with the thing, despite having no formal training with it. I agree (because time is time, right?) and head over.\n\nI find $oe in a comms closet hunched over the machine.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Hi, $primes. Look at this.\"\nHe runs the machine through a splicing cycle, and everything looks good...until the splice. When the lightning bolt flashes, the fiber ends glow, then kinda... vaporize. I'd never seen it do that before. As he gets back to work, I grab the splicer's manual and start looking.\n\nI get to the section discussing the electrodes and read that the electrodes need to be replaced every x arcs (I think it was 2000). In between splice attempts I glance at the splicer screen and read the arc count. It's nearly 3x! So I ask,\n\"When was the last time the electrodes were replaced?\"\n\"Today.\"\nme (internally): uh-huh.\n\"And did you run the electrode reset program when you did so?\"\n\"No.\"\n*facepalm*\n\nAs the machine makes arcs to melt the fibers, it damages and dulls the electrodes. The machine can correct for this by adjusting voltage, arc gap, etc. It makes these adjustments based on the arc count. Guess what the first thing the electrode reset program does? Reset the arc count to 0!\n\nI navigate through the menus and find the electrode reset program and start it. It says we will need to perform 40 test splices to calibrate the electrodes. Okay, whatever it takes. Ten splices in, $oe kicks me off the splicer saying he doesn't have time for this right now. He terminates the electrode reset program early and gets back to work. Only now, the splicer is working the way it should be and it reads \"Arc count:10.\"\n\nTo this day I don't think $oe understands what I did to make it work.\n\n*TL,DR: RTFM and tell the very precise machine that you've replaced a part so it can accommodate.*",

        "text": "Hey TFTS,  \n \nI need to get this out. Holy crap guys. We're going through a domain migration at my work this week.   \nThe process is as follows: the user drops off their computer, we run a script on their computer to migrate them and their data, once done we give the computer to a tech to call them to come and test their computer to make sure all systems good and fixing any issues that arise.    \n \nOn Monday I had a user who was migrated last week and was unable to see users calendars and his webex add-in was missing. Spent a total of 4 hours with this guy since email is tricky especially during a domain migration and webex was already a known issue for many people and it's a miracle if you can get it working. Got him fixed up though, so the hours were well spent.  \n \nToday I was assisting with the migration with users checking their computers after being migrated and I recognize the computer of the guy I helped for several hours Monday. I just kind of look at it like, did I imagine him telling me on Monday that he was migrated? Maybe... I have a bad memory so maybe I'm thinking of someone else. So I call him up to come over and nope, it's the same guy... So why did he bring his computer to be migrated again? I didn't wanna be a dick so I kept quiet with my question, and directed him to logging in. He was getting errors upon login regarding incorrect permissions (uh oh) and another weird error regarding our antivirus software that was too fast for me to read. It loaded the desktop though, so I had him test Outlook, he couldn't see others calendars. He gets all pissy and says to me: \"This is the same issue I had when I was migrated last week. When are you guys going to fix this??\"  \n \nI pause. Collect my thoughts. And try to form the question I want to ask and keep down the insults I want to hurl at him. \"Why did you come back today and go through the migration process again?\"  \n \nHim: (dumb look on his face) \"I don't know.\" \n \nMe: \"You were already migrated last week, coming back and having them run the same script when you've already been migrated can really mess your profile up. Hold on, don't touch anything, I'll be right back.\"   \nSo I go to the room with all the other techs and ask how bad this situation can be... They all just kinda look at me like \"Why the fuck would someone do that?\"  \n \nThankfully my shift was over and I needed to leave to grab my brothers so I had to leave it in the hands of another tech, but the tech I left it with texted me an hour later that the dude completely fucked his profile by doing this and it had to be recreated and the issues I helped him with on Monday came back as well.    \n  \n\n Woohoo for migrations, Yeah! (we're all dead inside here, send help) ",

He starts going onto a huge long rant \"I'm not a computer guy, I like to \"keep it simple stupid\" \" etc etc, so I schedule the appointment, thinking this is something simple like a login issue. He wants me to show up outside of normal business hours (open at 9, he wants 7am appointment)...I show up, and he brings out this old DV series HP laptop (one of the ones from the NVIDIA class action lawsuit) and fires it up. Someone has stripped it out, and installed windows XP on there. So, I ask him to reproduce the issue, and he fires into the same rant. \"I'm not a computer expert, I like to keep it simple stupid...\" but eventually he tells me his complaint is that AOL desktop is discontinued, and he hates the AOL shield browser they replaced it with. Cool. I find out he's paying for AOL, and try to download the new AOL Desktop Gold since I know that works.....but not on XP. crap.\nHe brings out this off brand toughbook, with windows 7 installed. nice. He says he didn't want to use that because the layout of windows 7 confused him (seriously wut?) \nSo, I loaded the classic theme, loaded AOL gold, signed in, and all was right with the world. Or, so I thought. I installed his printer, I restarted it, let it do a few updates, and left the customer.\n\nI got a call today that he's freaking out because he gets a now gets a \"not all network drives could be found\" notification, which to him means that he can't access the internet. After yelling at me that he's not a computer guy and telling me he likes to keep it simple, we get him to open AOL desktop, and he screams that it won't show a place to enter his password. I coax him into pressing the continue button so it shows the login screen, and get him logged in. He broke down, telling me that he's not a computer guy and likes to keep it simple, and demanded I get out there tomorrow to fix it or he'll sue microsoft and AOL. \n\nMy solution, I'm going to set up Chrome, with adblock, and make a desktop open-as-an-app shortcut to his AOL mail, put his money he paid me on the table, and block him from calling in again.\n\nThis ain't worth the trouble.\n\n\n\nedit: after turning it off and on again (despite telling me he did that before, everyone lies I guess) it's working.",

We'll call him John.\n\n&gt;Supervisor: \"Hey, sorry to bother you at home, but John has an issue that he needs fixed, or so he says, right now\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Ok, let me remote in.\" \n\n&gt;Supervisor:\"Ok, I'll transfer you and head over there\"\n\nAt this point, I remote in from home, and kick my feet up thinking this was just going to be a simple issue. \n\n&gt;\"Ok, we're here\"\n\n&gt;\"Alright, I'm in, what's the issue.\"\n\n&gt;John: \"After the last update my computer is all FUCKED UP what did you do?\"\n\n&gt;Supervisor:\"He didn't do anything, it's your damn sorting system, you need to use one.\"\n\nAt this point, they go in and out as they argue over who's fault it is. I catch snippets of where the issue is occurring. John was upset because his 'My Documents' folder wasn't sorting Microsoft Word documents first and by Date Modified, \"like it was yesterday\".\n\nI go into his 'My Documents' folder, and change the sort settings to set it up to do what he wanted. \n\n&gt;\"Ok, can you guys hear me?\" (They were still talking about his lack of organization)\n\n&gt;\"Yeah, we're here\"\n\n&gt;\"It's done, everything good?\"\n\n&gt;John:\"No, there are PDF's and folders I've never seen there. I am telling you man, it was perfect yesterday before my nap. I came back from my nap, and everything isn't working.\"\n\n&gt;\"Right, you opened and modified PDF's yesterday, that is why they are showing up.\"\n\n&gt;John:\"I only want Word Documents to show up, nothing else.\"\n\n&gt;\"Ok, I can show you how to do that.\"\n\nI change the view and cycle through the grouping, and options to view by type explaining what they do, until he loses it and says it'll do until tomorrow when I can come in and fix it.  \n\nI end the call, as they are still arguing about his \"system\", thinking they are crazy I dismiss it. And end the remote session. \n\nI wake up to this email:\n\n&gt;Thanks for trying yesterday to fix my computer.  Sorry it did not work.\n&gt;\n&gt;I will be in meetings from 8:45 - 1.  If you guys can fix it during that time, that would be great. If you cannot fix it let me know bc I will see if we can get some outside computer person to fix this. It is too hard for me to work with it not functioning as it did. And I have a ton of work I need to get done in the next few days.\n\nI get to work, and go to John's PC and start to check it out. It needed to be restarted for the 1709 update, so I restarted it, and waited. I go back to my office and get a call from John.\n\nWe set up a time to meet. At 1130. \n\nWhile he is away his PC updates, and I take the time to remote in an check it out. \n\nHOLY SHIT! He has EVERYTHING being automatically saved to his 'My Documents' folder, with no subfolders. It all there. 5286 word documents, 1745 PDF's and thousands of other files. His temporary files are copied there, software has been downloaded and installed there. \n\nI do what I can to clean up the programs, and downloads into folders. But it takes too long and I had to leave to meet up with him. \n\nHis PC restarted, and he goes to login.\n\n&gt;\"What is my login info?\"\n\n&gt;\"What? It is your login info you always use.\"\n\n&gt;\"Yeah, I know what is it?\"\n\n&gt;\"It should be the first letter of your first name, and your last name.\"\n\n&gt;\"yeah that's not working, I don't think it was that, it wasn't that yesterday before my nap.\"\n\n&gt;\"Ok, I'll login and we can see what the issue is.\" I login and confirm his logon information. I begin to go to 'My Documents' folder to talk him through everything.\n\n&gt;John: \"Woah man, let me show you what I am talking about.\"\n\n&gt;\"Ok.\"\n\n&gt;John: \"Open Word, go to open, and you'll see what I am talking about\"\n\nI do this, and file explorer comes up, and take 10 mins to load all of the files.\n\n&gt;John:\"See what I am talking about?\"\n\nExplorer was only showing 3 files. ODT files. So I switch it to 'All Word Documents'.\n\n&gt;John:\" You fixed it! Alright man, I'm headed to the club, I gotta take a nap after that, way to go.\"\n\n&gt;\"Wait, what? That is what was wrong?\"\n\n&gt;John:\"Yeah man, you fixed it.\"\n\n&gt;\"Nothing was wrong. You just opened an ODT file and tried looking for a Word Doc.\"\n\n&gt;John:\"man, I don't even know what an ODT file is, I would never open one.\"\n\n&gt;\"Ok, well you did, and that is why it was selected. You need to select 'All Word Documents' if you want to see word docs.\"\n\n&gt;John:\"Well fix that, I only want to see word docs.\"\n\n&gt;\"You can't do that, you might need to open other documents that aren't word docs. Like text files, PDFs or word type documents from different word processing software.\" \n\n&gt;\"Yeah I don't want that, lock it to that setting. Word can't open PDFs hahaha\"\n\n&gt;\"I can't do that.\"\n\nHe starts to argue, I stop him and sit him down for a 30 min lesson on why that is a bad idea, how it can't happen, won't happen, and how he has to fix \"his system\" of organization.\n\nAfter his classroom time, I go back to my office and turn up his UAC controls, he is too scary to leave his settings normal. \n\nDisclosure:\n\nI work part-time. It is a pretty sweet gig, 5 hours a day, and if I work more than that I can shift my hours around so I work less on other days. \n\nI tell you that, because as the end of the year is upon us, I have shifted all my hours, and my leave to take every Thursday and Friday off from November 1 to Jan 1. Because of users like this. \n\nThis is only possible, because of my users, so I thank you all :)  \n\nEdit: Formatting\nEdit 2: Spelling\nTL;DR User wasted my time, threatened to get \"outside help\" to fix his issue, for opening files in word, while it wasn't selected to search for .doc/.docx files.\n\n",

        "text": "LTL, FTP and NMS. \n\nThis tale takes place some 20+ years ago. It was the age of SCO SVR3.2v4.2 and 9k6 modems. It took place a few years prior to my initiation, but it's the all time greatest story about support in our company, so I've decided to share it anyway. \n\nA little bit of background^z:  I work in a company that makes logistics systems. We sell huge machinery, that can distribute ten thousands of items each hour. Our typical customers would not be able to function without our systems, unless they employed people by the hundreds to do the same tasks. Back in the mid-1990s remote support was restricted to dial-up. While the European telephone network at that time was overall OK, there was local problems. At this particular site, it felt like the final connection from the telco to the modem was two strands of wet string, that only got a fresh spray of water on Thursdays. This happened on a Wednesday.\n\nDramatis personae:\n\n* $CWB: The L2 supporter who earned his spurs.\n* $SRM: The service manager\n* $F&amp;F: Senior managment, and because this was a startup at that time, also the technical intelligentsia.\n\nAnd now, let the story unfold. \n\nAt one Wednesday night, the customer had performed a test for an upcoming upgrade of one of their systems. Everything had gone well, and the new system was all but certified to go into action. But upon switching back to the existing system, things started being not so well. The verification of the old customer system being ready to resume operation failed in a spectacular way:\n\nObjects going into the load points would almost always stay put for 30 seconds, after which they were routed directly to a fault destination. Those few that was routed elsewhere, was almost always sent to a wrong destination instead. \n\nAfter some trouble with the flaky modem not allowing the supporters much tme to guess at the cause, $SRM was convinced by the customer to send a supporter onsite at the first given oppurtunity. As the customer was in fact at a major air traffic hub at that time, it was a matter of getting someone on the first morning plane from AAAA to DDDD with the inevitable switch at CCCC:\n\n&gt; $cust: What do you mean he can only be here at 10AM? We need this system running no later than 4:45 AM. \n\n&gt; $SRM: That's the earliest time a departure fra AAAA to DDDD is possible. \n\n&gt; $cust: That's not good enough. Not having this ready by morning will screw up the air traffic in half^y of Western Europe. Send you man to the AAAA airport; we'll send someone to get him.\n\nAnd so, $SRM calls an underling, $CWB, urging him to check for helicopters with rope ladders, and in their absence, get to AAAA airport right away. On arrival at the totally closed airport (at this time it's 2AM), $CWB eventually find the only two people at work, who are somewhat perplexed about what kind of VIP is needing the service of the airport at that time. But a plane appears, and $CWB get through the fastest boarding know to man, and is whisked away. \n\nAfter 1500 km of flight, $CWB land in an airport terminal that's not shaped like a doughnut, and are escorted around any and all kind of immigrations and customs checkpoints, deep into the bowels of the futuristic concrete palace. Upon arriving in the lair of the logistic system, he can see with his own eyes that the problem is what the customer stated. He also grabs a phone and call the home base:\n\n\n&gt; $CWB: I'm in position, and things suck. Please advice.\n\n&gt; $CRM: While you were flying, $F&amp;F managed to get online, and took a look at it. They're 99% certain that the wiring for the serial links to the two loading positions have been mixed up. Spend 10 minutes looking at the terminal and go hmm, and then ask for the echnician to switch the wires.\n\nAnd so it happened. The crisis was averted, $CWB got his spurs, and panic was averted. However,  $CWB had to take a commercial flight back home.\n\n\n\nz: And a possible rule 0 violation. There are people who will be able to guess which company I work for, based on the fact that it isn't their story. I hope that's acceptable.\n\ny: As it did 15 years later, when a PM from $cust decided that leaving the same system inoperable halfway through a Y2K test was not a big deal, because he wanted to go home NOW!!",

Obviously, the d20 was in my favor.*  \n\n**Dramatis Personae:**  \n$Extension, yours truly  \n$BlazeIT, our beleaguered offsite tech  \n$JoeRogan, the former beleaguered offsite tech  \nA newbie, who shall not be named  \n\nHave you ever been at a job long enough to step back and realize *holy crap, I have seniority now*? Someone mentions your \"senior project manager\" or \"tier 2 lead\" or whatever, and it takes a hot second to realize they're referring to *you*.  \nIt's akin to how you start realizing you're old, but I'm trying to blithely ignore the existential dread for now.  \nPoint being, we're training some newbies, and that always comes with fun. Odd questions that you know by heart, silly mistakes you haven't made in years, and side observations that give you a moment's pause and *wait, why *are** *we doing it this way?*  \nAnd, occasionally, an object lesson in **Things You Do Not Fuck With, Ever^tm .**\n\nDuring the morning huddle, we generally go over on-site trips and big projects, to get an idea of where everyone's going to be. It's also the opportunity to bring up stupid questions you want a group opinion on. So I didn't think too much of it when one of the new guys made an off-hand comment about DNS and email. We quickly determined the issue was over his head, and that the lead tech $BlazeIT would be the better one to take the head on it.  \n\n*(Since I know this will come up: this particular newbie had enough experience and had been with us long enough that it was determined he was OK to get access to our main documentation. Said determination methods are currently under review.)*  \n\nI got a call during lunch that I put off because I was on the phone with a VIP. Skype dinged shortly.  \n&gt;**$BlazeIT:** pls halp  \n**$Extension:** what  \n**$BlazeIT:** I have two servers down I need to get to with a quickness  \n**$BlazeIT:** and a bigwig computer down  \n**$BlazeIT:** can you take a look at the email issue with $client for me  \n**$BlazeIT:** I think it's storage space but I don't know how that could be   \n\nI got a sinking feeling but ultimately agreed. And 10 minutes later as I pulled up the host webpage I knew exactly what was going on, and said feeling was confirmed.  \nEither before we took on this client, or at some point when $Rogan had it, their email was....convoluted. The MX records confirmed they were subscribed to their hosting platform's SpamBlockrPlus, which dumped their email into said hosting platform's webmail client. From *there*, forwarding rules sent the emails to a \"client @domain.test.whatever.google.com\" alias in their Suite, and they accessed everything via that web console.  \nMany moons ago, I was troubleshooting an email issue at that client, not knowing the background, and spent hours searching in vain before ultimately discovering the cat's cradle that was their email setup. I told $Rogan that he needed to fix it. I offered my assistance in doing so if needed. He said he would take care of it, and a bit later assured me that he had.  \nApparently \"taking care of it\" does not mean what I think it means. But that wasn't the (current) problem.  \nTheir MX records' top entries were priority 10, 20 and 30 SpamBlockrPlus. But underneath that, at priorities 31, 33, 33, 35, and 35, were google.com entries. And the problem being reported was that senders were getting bouncebacks saying \"not authorized to relay this message.\"  \nThankfully, their DNS seemed to propagate quickly, and within 15 minutes of deleting the *extraneous* entries, I was able to send a test email to the admin account. And after a quick chat with the client, they were amenable to getting their DNS moved over during the holiday break.  \n\nI got to have a.....talk.....with the newbie in question when they got back from lunch. Mostly consisting of the words \"Do Not Fuck With DNS\" and \"For The Love Of God, Ask Someone First\".",

        "text": "M.I. I.T. – A 33W tale - Power issue\n\nI have a handful of stories that were not work related but barracks tech support related.\n\n\nAs new soldiers came over to Germany, they were put into a 2 week long orientation groups.  Lots of important information was conveyed about the culture and general ways of life in Germany.\n\n\nAs new soldiers were getting settled, I would come by barracks rooms to introduce myself and give some minor warnings about electronics use, internet, and mobile phone plans.  For those who do not know, Germany runs 230Vs at 50Hz.  This was always my first warning to new people.  Some listen, others “know how it works”.  OK bud, whatever you say.\n\n\nOne fine Saturday as I am drinking and playing WoW, a new motor pool mechanic appears in my open doorway.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Good day Private Snuffy.  What can I help you with?\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: what was it you said about the power outlets and to be careful?\n\n\n&gt;Me: Well if you have a TV, PlayStation, or computer you want to use, get a step down converter.  If you can’t get one, I can see if your device is dual voltage.\n\n\n&gt;Snuff: What if you get a plug adapter? That would be ok right?\n\n\n&gt;Me:… Um, No\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: …..\n\n\n&gt;Me: You used just the plug adapter didn’t you?\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: .. Yes.\n\n\n&gt;Me: On what?\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: my gaming computer.  I heard a pop and a little smoke came out.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Well diagnostics are free. Payment for repairs is cash or booze.\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: Booze? Is a sixer of bud light ok?\n\n\n&gt;Me: Get out.\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: what?!  You said booze or cash\n\n\n&gt;Me: (Long lecture about being in the home of beer, American stuff sucks, and if he wanted anything done, it would be good rum or a rack of Weihenstephaner Hefe)\n\n\n&gt;Snuffy: OK! Geez I just got here.\n\n\nSnuffy produced a bottle of Captain Morgan (good enough) and his desktop.  The power supply was dual voltage but he failed to switch it over manually and killed the whole power supply.  Retrieved slightly more powerful auto switch power supply from local place.  Installed it, checked his system, and thankfully he only killed the power supply.  Snuffy thanked me and was on his way.  I can’t count the number of times this similar scenario happened with computers, TVs, and gaming consoles.  Some people accepted the loss and bought new.  Some were fixed. The rest were screaming fits about stupid power outlets and why not be American standard, blah blah blah.   I helped new people for the 4 years I was there and people still failed to listen to the warnings.\n\n\nCheck your power supply, check your device, and when in doubt ask an expert.\n",

        "text": "I used to have my own IT company before I was employed by the company I work for now, I was self employed for many years - but after gaining enough Tales From Tech Support every week to fill this entire forum, I burned out and crashed hard.\n\nI'm glad my work is handed o me in chunks now, instead of taking on too much and never sleeping/having free time/being stressed as my normal everyday standard feeling.\n\nI feel like unloading a few memories to this sub seeing as I've just found it. So here's an oldie, but a goldie..\n\n-\n\nI used to do website design, programming, design work, system building/repair/upgrades.. the usual skill set. Also.. teaching (I'm *very* patient, you have to be..).\n\nAnyway, I get a weird call from a guy who is literally a few doors down from my house. To this day I have no idea how he got my number. This guy doesn't really have an ego, he's too simple for malice or bragging, he just thinks you'll be interested in his achievements. The call (and every time I met him after this) goes something like.. 'Hi, I'm the leading Tax lecturer in the entire country, I need to learn powerpoint to lecture people with slide behind me. Everywhere I am going now no longer has an acetate projector and insists I use a laptop, can you help?'\n\n.\n\nSo, I arrive. The guy has NEVER touched a wall socket, let along a computer. I have to write down every step, from plugging in the laptop, to turning it on, to logging in and I make it easier with icons and text messages with help everywhere. I spent about 6 hours teaching him how to create and save a document before we even got to powerpoint. After all that time, he just threw his hands up and declared 'I'll pay you to do it'.\n\n\n-\n\nSo from that moment on, twice a week, I would walk to his house, read his emails to him (he would also print every SINGLE one and put them in an ever-growing folder on his shelf) and he would print the replies he sent to people as well. \"It's just easier if I can look at the copy without opening the computer\".\n\n-\n\nI am extremely quick with shortcuts and typing, so as he was dictating, I was adding slides, effects, fonts etc. He was quite annoyed at my hourly rate - but I'm not a secretary, I do IT support - he didn't understand the difference. We got in a couple of fights over it all.. he hired someone else one week, then apologised and called me back the next week because the guy was '10 times slower, didn't understand what I wanted.. it took forever just to do a few slides'..\n\n-\n\nOver the 3 years I did this for him he doubled my money at least twice, which was very nice of him. Insisting I take it - as his business grew, he passed the money on to me, which was great. Although no amount of money will fix the dental work I need from gritting my teeth and getting through his infuriating idiosyncratic slide layours and punctuation weirdness that he would not budge on. Boy his slides looked weird.. So, instead of using just bullet points, he would number everything and overuse a hyphens AND a Colon AND a bullet point. So :-\n\n\n-\n\n- 1) :- This is point number one :- here's what it is about\n\nThe two worst things that ever happened were :\n\n1) teaching him to use a bluetooth pointer for powerpoint, so he didn't have to press the 'right' arrow every next slide and getting calls EVERY day from a lecture hall somewhere (on the landline because he couldn't use a mobile phone) asking me how to plug in the dongle. Or, if it ran out of batteries. After replacing them once, he always took a pack of 28 AAs with him everywhere he went.\n\n2) When I told him I was leaving IT and the city and moving to follow my dreams into music. He threw a major hissy fit, I was driving out of his driveway after he screamed at me for leaving him in the lurch (I'd given him 3 months notice and a list of people who could take over from me in the area) and he was hanging onto my window begging me not to drive away. It was embarassing watching a grown man flip out like that.. like I said, some sort of tax genius, but really 'simple' in his own special way.\n\n-\n\nThis was about 6 years ago, I see he has a website now. IT comes across exactly as he does 'The countries best tax lecturer'.\n\n-\n\nCan you think of anything worse to sit through than a lecture on tax - I had to endure reading and writing slides for years about rules, legislations, loopholes, guidelines etc... my head is full of utter nonsense I'll never need. Also - he thought he was hilarious, so after months of text based slides, I mentioned you could put pictures in and he went crazy putting photos of his favourite football team in and making up tax related gags about sport. It was cringe worthy. His website has one page about contacting him about tax, the rest are photos of him and football players and a sweaty picture of him running and boxing. Apparently he trains with 'someone moderately well known' and whoever made the site for him had to put that information and a picture of the dude. He was also into seriously mainstream television )Top model, X factor, 'got talent' etc... and there were slides about what was going on in these great TV shows to break up the monotony of a 3 hour lecture on tax.\n\n-\n\nOh man.. ! Just writing this has brough back so many memories! Soooo many tales! I forgot about the one where the computer was in the snake pit.. or the widow of a psychic who asked me to build a computer that could email 'the other side'. (100% straight face)",

        "text": "An antipattern is a commonly occurring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences. In an organization, an antipattern can be the result of a manager or developer not knowing any better, but it often results from someone \"solving\" a problem in a way that works for their concern, but is suboptimal (!) to the organization as a whole.\n\nToday's Antipattern:  The Labor Saving Intern\n\nOur company has a pretty good ~~bureaucracy~~ culture for talent development.  Part of that is providing lots of (paid) opportunities to review a candidate before hiring.  It's rare to get an IT job without a contracting stint of at least a few months.  In addition, we hire quite a few recent IT grads and  rotate them through several areas to give them exposure to various jobs before they commit to a permanent position.  Since their salary is paid by another organization, they're \"free\"!   \n\nManagers \"bid\" for these interns.  They come up with small set of tasks that cover 30 - 90 days, and interns read the descriptions and rank their preferences.  It's a great introduction to the real world, since the Manager's sales pitch is usually \"We do X. You'll be exposed to sexy technologies A, B, and C.  You'll work with happy smiling people and have lots of fun!\"  and omit \"while filling in spreadsheets and gathering pointless data 40 hours a week\".\n\nSorry for the long intro.  Here's the Amusing Anecdote:\n\nA fresh round of interns has started.  After a week or two of on-the-job training (here's the restroom, here's the trouble ticket system, here's the timecard system), they were unleashed.  Immediately, there's a flood of confused, incomplete trouble tickets.\n\nOne intern was asked to review the CMDB (configuration management database).  I've seen 4 tickets today for missing data - \"what application runs on host XYZ?\" \"Please list cpu, memory, disk for these 12 hosts\".  I IM the requestor - \"Can't you get this info?\"  \"Oh, no, we're not allowed to login to the boxes.  Besides, those are Linux, I don't know that\".\n\nNext ticket - \"We need to run a DR test on application Y123.  Can we do this tomorrow after lunch?\"  Um, No.  Y123 is in production, and generates about $1MM worth of revenue *a day*.  The maintenance window is 2 - 8 AM third Sunday of the month, except we're in a change freeze until February.  And a DR test requires business approval, and support engineers from networking, clustering, storage, OS, database, and application support - for 2 or three applications.\n\nTL;DR - Managers use labor-saving interns to create more work for other departments.\n\n\n",

I use the term \"special\" in that way to indicate that they did some really strange stuff for an ISP.  Such as rebooting their DNS server at 4pm EST every day.  No, not 4am, *4pm* - when people are still at work, doing, you know, work.  So every day at 4pm, we'd lose DNS for about 15 minutes and many processes would grind to a halt.  Extra special points because *they* managed our internal DNS, so nothing could connect to anything on our internal network either.  Since we were a software development shop, and hosted our own web application, this was kind of an issue.  But I had a cunning plan!\n\nI scavenged the back room and found some old parts: a 386sx with *maybe* 1 whole MB of RAM, two 20MB hard drives, and a case.  I pulled down the latest FreeBSD (because at the time, a minimal FreeBSD could be installed into an exquisitely tiny space, such as two 20MB hard drives...) and installed a base FreeBSD install along with BIND on that machine.  I set up BIND to do DNS forwarding and had our network guy point everyone to it instead of the ISP.  Somehow, it worked.  It wasn't going to win any computation contests, but it worked.  \n\nEvery day at 4pm, the ISP still rebooted their DNS server, but it didn't affect us anymore.  ",

It is not a waste of time to ask questions if you don't take up too much time and if the questions are non-repetitive.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFor example he'd ask me questions about the camera app in his phone and I was stupid enough to be nice and show him some functions. The information didn't seem to stick so there was a lot of repetition. I frankly told him the settings are already good and automatic so he shouldn't really need to know the stuff I'm showing him at his insistence.\n\nIt then got to a point where he would take out his Canon point and shoot (a quality model nonetheless) camera took a picture of the wall to compare to a picture of the wall that he took on his phone. Then he remarked, \"look, the quality on the Canon is better. Why is the quality better?\" Well for one, his phone is a Tracphone. It appears to run Android 2.2 tho maybe it's as new as 3, 4 or 5. Definitely no later than Honeycomb. \n\nThe phone also had less megapixels and that was the crux of my answer aside from the fact that a dedicated Canon camera will usually be better than even a not so shitty phone. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy answer wasn't enough, so he pressed me more.. like a bad game of 21 questions. So I go on to explain that the Canon camera has far superior optics to that of a Tracphone. Still not enough! So then I simply try to point out form an engineering POV that there simply isn't any room in the phone to put comparable optics so it should be no surprise tht the quality on the phone's camera is lower.\n\nHe still repeated, took a picture of the wall with each camera and continued his inquiry until I transitioned into passive aggressive and then to somewhat discourteous. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis guy came back right before closing time another time and did the same thing. This time I insisted he needed an appointment an then he asked some questions anyway. I then said, \"I'll give you the next appointment and I'm out of here.. my associate will help you.\" He then played the \"my wife is waiting in the car\" card but I didn't bite. I left because well, after a long day it is my right and interacting with this man is not generating profit nor is it even serving a humanitarian purpose unless he's really lonely.\n\n\nSo he did drift in and both my associate as he helped other customers, ones who were willing to make appointments but eventually left that night.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe came in once or twice since but I was fortunate not to see him for a few months until yesterday. It started with me in the back behind the thin wall talking to my technician buddy. The \"customer\" came up to the counter, saw no oe, said \"hello\" and knocked on the composite wood a few times. I actually purposely took ten extra seconds to come out after that.\n\nThis time he was asking about a problem with his wife's phone. He didn't have the phone on him but he said that it wasn't charging and indicated that he wasn't sure if it was the battery or something else. \"What else could it be?\" Those were his words. \n\n\nI advised that maybe it could be a loose USB port on the phone itself but a sure way to rule that out would be to try a different charging cable. It's not uncommon for them to wear out. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy succinct response had to be repeated because he had to repeat his inquiry. Somewhere in the middle of this five minute period he felt the need to say, \"you know, I sing.\" As in he sings at the bar, karaoke or some performance maybe like a Sinatra wannabe Church event. I didn't acknowledge it because I'm in the zone of work and was already putting on my coat. Yeah, I was putting on my coat pretending to leave for a scheduled departure. If I didn't he would've clenched on and prevented me from getting shit done for a long time anyway.\n\n\"You know, I sing.\" x 3. Literally said it three times in a row until I would acknowledge it. Still didn't give a shit and my expression indicated as much. So I offered to make him an appointment and to allow my coworker to answer further questions but he declined and left.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAbout an hour later I'm back and I'm wrestling a 55\" TV into the box. I'm hauling ass 15 minutes before closing time to get the returns organize into groups of \"ready to re-sell\" and \"send out for repair\" which includes paper work that I'd like to bang out sooner than later in my own interests and and int he interests of the company in terms of saving on labor costs.\n\nThe guy appears out of nowhere, asked the same question about the phone charger, asked if the light should blink on the phone (depends on the phone) repetitiously described the blinking light while doing a hand gesture to represent a blinking light then asked, \"can I bring the pnone back in the next 15 minutes so you can look?\" I answered all his questions to that point so at that last question as I continued to do what I was doing I plainly said, \"I got shit to do.\" He thanked me and left. I mean like not that quick but within forty seconds of me saying that I had shit to do so yay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe also asked me for my name and I forgot to give a fake one. Maybe I'll give him a fake name next time he asks. ",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, I am the Bowling Alley Guy, and I will be caring for you and your sense of boredom during this difficult time. You see...\n\n* * * \n\nIt all started in the spring one fine year, and I found myself working at a new location. This was the culmination of my entire career in the bowling industry to this point, as I had finally moved into the position as Head Mechanic. I was the one in charge of maintenance, which meant I could finally pursue my long held goal of *improving* the state of our equipment and not merely maintaining it in its current state.\n\nOf course, with new power comes new responsibilities, the relevant one this time being that I am essentially the highest level of maintenance technician we have, and it's ultimately up to me to either fix what can't be fixed, or hire outside help to do it for us. And corporate really doesn't like it when we can't do it ourselves.\n\nSo one morning I come in to find the Power Lift (which is the bit on the approach that pulls the bowling balls off of the underground track and places them on the ball rack for the bowler to use again) for lanes 7 and 8 is not working. According to the notes left by the mechanic who worked the night before, they were so busy that he didn't get to try more than a few things before his attention was needed elsewhere and it didn't get fixed before close. He of course, left it for me to solve.\n\nI briefly turned the lanes on to confirm it wasn't running, then retrieved a multi-meter and some wrenches from the back in case the motor had died and needed replacement.\n\nWhen pulling open the floor panel under the ball rack that covers all the inner workings, two things become immediately apparent: there's a lot of wires everywhere and everything is as dirty as it could possibly be. These are very simple machines; just a motor, belt, and a few pulleys, and so little goes wrong with them that we might go years without needing to open any particular one up.\n\nAs I reached in and brushed aside some of the rubber dust that had collected on the 1/2 horsepower motor, I felt around looking for the klixon reset button. Probably about 95% of power issues are just the reset button needing to be pressed, but for some reason I couldn't find one on this motor. Try as I might, there didn't seem to be one.\n\nNaively assuming that this meant the issue was in the relay box, I checked each connection with the multi-meter, and finding continuity everywhere I would expect to, decided the motor had probably died and needed to be changed. I set the multi-meter up on the floor beside me and began to unbolt the motor from its mount.\n\nNow, the big windings of copper wire and plastic we call electric motors aren't exactly light in weight, at least not at these sizes. This motor in particular weighs around 20 pounds (9-10kg) which isn't a lot, but when you're laying on your chest leaning into a hole in the floor you don't exactly have the best leverage to pick one up. So as I began to lift the motor from its mount, I had to reposition my legs to stabilize myself.\n\nAnd that's when I got stabbed in the knee.\n\nApparently, as I was blindly maneuvering myself to stay balanced, my right leg had slid over the multi-meter, and jammed one of the pointy probes straight into the side of my knee. I immediately dropped the motor and began to assess the damage to my leg.\n\nMy pants had done a good job stopping the probe from penetrating very deeply, but there was still some blood, and a bit of dirt around the surface of the wound. After all, I had just been waving these probes around in literal years of accumulated dirt looking for an electrical issue earlier.\n\nWhile going through the standard first aid (wash wound, apply pressure (Ouch) to stop bleeding,etc) I started to Google Bing search how often one is supposed to get a Tetanus booster shot and tried to remember the last time I had one. The last occasion I had received any sort of vaccination or inoculation was in high school, which might not even have been for tetanus, so I immediately called a local clinic and set up an appointment for one the next morning.\n\nAt the appointment, the person treating me asked to see the wound, and noticing it was quite small commented that the tetanus booster would probably hurt more than the hole in my knee. She was right; my arm ached for a full week afterwards.\n\n**TL:DR:** Blood sacrifice gets ball lift working again.\n\n* * * \n\nEpilogue: Turns out the motor did have a klixon button, and pressing it was all that was necessary to restore power. My best guess is the motor had been placed in the mount in the wrong position and the mount had blocked access to the button. Also the recommended time to get a tetanus booster is every 8 - 10 years, which had definitely expired by this point for me.",

Target mode shows no drive. Bad news. I pull the drive (easy on older model) and plug it into a sled to see if I can recover any data. Strangely it loads right up, and I grab the files she needs. Strange that the laptop isn't booting though.\n\nWanting to see what's going on, we try a spare laptop drive in her computer. Again, can't see the drive. Put her internal drive into an enclosure, hook it up to her computer, and tell it to boot from the external drive - no issues. So clearly bad SATA connection in the machine, but she's now at least got a working laptop until she can get the hardware repaired.\n\nAs she left, she asked \"Do you drink?\"\n\nBig smile. \"I work in tech support - of course I drink!\" Scotch is metioned.\n\nI think there's a bottle of scotch in my future.

        "text": "After some of my previous tales where from my newer clients, the glorious Aviation stories by https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeewulfeh got me back into some of my old navy stories. \n#Disclaimer:#\n As usual, English is not my native language. The stories where over a decade ago, and in the military. Some details might be a bit fuzzy here and there. Blame security and my bad memory. \nSo brace for impact, here comes the first one: \n#Setting:# \n*$me*: Young officer on his first ship duty. Normally there weren’t it officers, all the peksy computer stuff was done by lower ranks. But the Navy decided they needed COMPETENCE. So I was send to attend army training courses to become one of the first NAVY IT GODS .. AKA powerpoint 101: How to camouflage a sat dish. My ship was one of our new prototypes and they wanted to have a officer grade hacker and engineer to get the systems running. And because we were a small boat, I didn’t have a big subunit .. it was me and one soldier.  And tow other more ore less useless officers.\n\n*$minion*: My soldier. Nice bloke, ending up being friends till today.\n\n*$rustycar*: Our second IT officer, because the navy HQ in all its wisdom, had decided that these new it officers needed someone with a lot of experience to help these hacker guys. So I got a former radar tech mustang (aka former sergeant promoted to officer) to help me fix windows machines etc ^^. Went great. But that are other stories. \n\n*$skipper*: Well my skipper. Studied computer sience 20 years ago. Still thought he was a computer guru. \n\n*$cook*: The resident cook and quartermaster of the dry dock support barracks we were staying. \n\n*$Helpdesk*: The helpdesk of the big company who won the big military outsourcing bid.\n\n#Setup:#\nWe were in the naval drydock. Like for a long time. Engine exploded. Turned out using steel to counter hold a titanium shaft wasn’t the brightest ideas ever. But I had enough to do, fresh from all the Microsoft certifications I went to work. My inner great idea fairy got me thinking: “We need a windows domain:\n\n*Domain controller, check have this running\n\n\n*DHCP, check, using the normal germanmilitary.gov servers\n\n\n*DNS Server, check, using the normal germanmilitary.gov servers\n\n\nWAIIITTTT … we are a ship … no cable no DNS &amp; DHCP. Also if the Hosts can’t find the AD I’m screwed.  Dammit .. so I went to work:\n\n\n*Building a DHCP out of a crappy pc, only giving out IPs and DNS Info to the preregistered mac addresses of our gear GENIUS !!!\n\n\n*Building a DNS Server on the same pc, cloning our military domain info, but also adding SHIPNAME. germanmilitary.gov and pointing it to our internal domain. \n\n\n*ordering a additional server to be installed, because the crappy pc is not ideal, but will do in the temporary barracks. \n\n\n\nEverything worked perfectly fine, our crew was happy that I finally got rid of the crappy SAMBA server $rustycar build before I joined the unit. $minion was happy that I got finally rid of the sneaker admin style $rustycar preferred and we were on proper remote administration. No more running around to our servers to fix stuff. We could do it from our barracks 1 km away. Great times for everybody. \n#UNTIL the week before Christmas.#\n$cook was bitching inside my office that his computer is not working. Since he was on the normal military system and not in my domain I couldn’t do anything, but I promised to look into his office later. Suddenly our $skipper poked the head into my office. \n\n$Skipper: “Hey LT. Theo there is a call from $Helpdesk coming through our sat com system.”\n\n$me:”What ??? normally we call THEM and normally I would use the landline instead of the 5 bucks / minute sat com. Could you give them my desk telephone nr please and ask them to call there ?”\n\n2 Minutes later:\n\n$Helpdesk: “Hello, are we speaking with the admin from SHIPNAME ? “\n\n$me: “Yes, what is the problem ?”\n\n$Helpdesk:” Well we have a network problem.”\n\n$me:”Yes our cook told me ..”\n\n$Helpdesk:”Yeah our DHCP and DNS infrastructure is down. Had a issue in the server farm. “\n\n$me:” Yeah sounds bad .. and ?”\n\n$Helpdesk:”Well we will not get any replacement till next year. You know holiday season and such …”\n\n$me:” Well that sounds bad, so basically north Germany is dark ?”\n\n$Helpdesk:”Well not exactly .. that is the reason why I was calling you. You see normally duto our new outsorcing and such, yes we would be dark. And right now we would be really in the crapper.You know on the FüAK (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Academy_of_the_German_Armed_Forces) in Hamburg there is this important training. They called earlier that their video conference system is not working. While we were trying to find the flaw it started working again.”\n\n$me:”Well that is great, ….”\n\nI got a bad feeling with the call so far, so while talking I started to look into my logs …yepp there it was video.fueak.germanmilitary.org …….. CRAPPPPPPPP IP lease and a lot of DNS requests my crappy PC was happy to reply … \n\n$Helpdesk:”Yeah you see .. right now your unit is the only one able to reply to all the DHCP and DNS request because we centralised all the servers and we got this problem with the routing and such …So we would like you to operate your server till we can get replacement in place.”\n\n$Me:” CRAPPPP”\n\nTL;DR: Got a great idea as a young admin, spent Christmas hoping that a old crapy PC doesn’t die.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Background: about a decade in IT support - networks, hardware, software. I have worked for different companies that provide IT support to other companies.\n\nDisclosure: English is not my first language, so there probably are mistakes. If the mistakes bother you, please point them out, I will try to correct them.\n\nThe Client built themselves a new office. They also built a dedicated server room in the core of the building. The room was rectangular, the shortest side was wide enough for two rack cabinets side by side, but barely enough room to get behind them (I'm a big guy, but when I sucked my stomach in I was able to get behind the rack cabinets), the long side was maybe a 5 meters (about 16 feet for our American friends) long, the height was about 3 meters (10 feet). The room had one AC unit (it was enough when it worked) and an air moisturizer (apparently to prevent static build-up, I don't know if it had any effect), that made the room smell like burning rubber. The ventilation was really bad, they later drilled a hole through the ceiling, that helped a little.\n\nAt the time the client had 4 servers - A file server, Mail server, test server for their database system  and a server for the telephone system. All were physical servers, because virtualization was not really a thing yet. There were also some switches and couple of UPS'es.\n\nFirst time we noticed that something was wrong, when the monitoring alerts notified us that the servers were down. I went to the site to check it out. I  could hear the fans from the first floor. The fireproof door of the server room was warm. When I opened the door a gust of hot air hit me. The ambient temperature was 45 C (113 F for our American friends), I can't imagine how hot the processors were. And one of the servers was still running! The others had passed out from the heat. I checked the AC unit - it was off. Like no power, pressing the buttons on the remote or on the unit did nothing. \n\nI left the server room door open and went to the fuse box, and found one of the breakers in the off position. Conveniently the schematics of the box were right there - yep, it was the fuse for the AC unit. Turned it on and the AC unit started working. Once the server room temperature was low enough, I restarted all the servers.\n\nI reported this incident to the client and recommended that an electrician and the HVAC guys check the equipment, because this didn't seem normal.\n\nThe same thing happened two weeks later. And then again 3 weeks later. \n\nThe last time it happened on Christmas eve, but guess who was on call? Yep, yours truly. \n\nI was about 150 km (about 100 miles for our American friends) out of the city visiting my mum. Got my first speeding ticket trying to get back to the clients site as fast as possible (\"my servers are on fire\" was not a good enough excuse for the police).\n\nThat was it. I told the client that I refuse to take the responsibility for their servers until they fix the damn AC unit. So they (finally) called a HVAC guy in. It turned out that whoever installed the unit managed to connect the fan wrong way, so when the unit was powered on the fan drew more current than it was supposed to and sometimes tripped the breaker. Once the fan was connected correctly, the problem disappeared.\n\nSomehow we didn't lose any servers or even a single hard disk…\n\nTL;DR - **$me** - \"But officer, my servers are literally on fire!\"; **$Police** - \"Are they celebrating the Christmas too?\"\n",

        "text": "I don't remember exactly what I was doing at the time when my father knocked on my door frame. Playing video games, I assume. I know it snapped me out of a daze, which is a rare event when you're living with your parents between jobs.\n\nMy folks were always good about letting me be an adult: No forcing me to go to church, no making me do chores unless I made the mess, no patronizing me because I was their child, etc., which is why this exchange seemed all the more bizarre:\n\n“Hey $MeatBot, we're all going over to your grandmother's for supper.”\n\n“Okay,” I say, suspicious. \"I have to go?\"\n\n\"Yep. you have to.\"\n\n\"Is something going on?\"\n\n\"We're going to supper.\"\n\nI narrowed my eyes at him. Dad never talks like this, but as he said, I have no choice. I hop into the truck feeling like an scolded child. Further probing reveals nothing, though I suspect I'm going to be put to work somehow.\n\nGrandma, further known as “Mimi”, was happy to see me. \"I'm so glad you're here to fix my computer!\" She said brightly.\n\n*\"FIX YOUR COMPUTER.\"* I inflected toward Dad. \"Why yes. I would be *happy* to do that.\" So this had been Dad's game. After all these years, he was trying to excuse himself from the role of family tech support. By giving the job to me, I would now be branded as someone who knows the mystical art of computer repair and would have no choice but to handle my share of the questions and troubleshooting.\n\nBut there was no time to dwell on that now. I sighed and put it aside, asking Mimi what was wrong.\n\n“Oh don’t worry about that now. Let’s get you fed.” Mimi was always the grandma first.\n\nAfter a delicious supper, I was lead to the back bedroom office, where an old square 16” flatscreen sat hooked up to a generic Dell tower running, of all things, Vista.\n\n“I was saving some pictures and it told me I was out of room, and then it starting running real slow. The mouse jumps around... everything is slow.”\n\nSure enough, I give the mouse a wiggle and the cursor stutters around the desktop.\n\n“Have you been getting any pop-up ads?”\n\n“No, no pop-ups. Just running slow.”\n\nSo much for the easy answer. “Alright, I’ll see what I can do.” She leaves me to it, and goes to chat with my parents. If I recall, Dad gets put to work on something home repair related, so at least he doesn’t get off scot-free, but I digress. I very patiently wait for Task-manager to pull up and see a CPU usage of 100%. Sorting by takes me right to the culprit, a picture management application ($PicApp). I kill the process and immediately the computer is back to normal operating speeds as expected.\n\nHowever, I suspect I’ve only fixed a symptom of the cause. I find $PicApp and open it up, and am greeted with a message “Error: Hard drive is full” and the return of slow processing speeds. I kill the process once again. Time to start digging into some searches: “Vista $PicApp runs slow”, “Vista $PicApp max CPU”, etc. My Google-fu gets a thorough workout the likes of which it hasn’t seen in some time. The results are mostly unanswered forum posts, with a few offering wrong turn solutions.\n\n“Mimi!”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Do you use $PicApp at all?”\n\n“Yes, that’s what I use for my photos.”\n\n“Would you be willing to use a different software?”\n\n“Well, I have all my pictures sorted on there.”\n\n“Alright, never mind.” She wasn’t going to switch apps if she didn’t have to. Alternate software out of the question. I have to find the solution. I dig through more search results, until remember to do something that should have been obvious: search for the error message. “Vista $PicApp Error: Hard drive full” I mean the hard drive being full shouldn’t affect how the software runs should it?\n\nBut of course it does. Suddenly the forum posts I find are relevant to the issue at hand. “$PicApp is slow when I open it”, “Found out $PicApp is copying $VideoFile until hard drive full” WHAT. I open the video folder and sure enough it’s packed with copies. I go on a deleting rampage and open the software again, watching the folder.\n\nOne file populates.\n\nThen another.\n\nAnd another.\n\nI let it run until sure enough: “Error: Hard drive full.” I found the cause. Now what’s the solution? The thread offers nothing. I try moving a video file out of the folder, and the software copies a different file. Okay then, let’s try all videos in a different location! No good. The software finds them and starts copying. Back to Google.\n\n“Mimi! Would you be ok with having no video files on your computer? I’m not sure I’m going to find a good fix for this issue.”\n\n“Well if that’s what it takes I think I can live with that,” she says in a surprisingly optimistic tone. \n\nMy heart broke a little at that. I don’t want to leave my dear grandmother without the option of saving videos to her PC. I keep digging until finally, the magical forum post with the one true solution is found: “$PicApp running slow… copying videos… known issue blah blah do a registry edit on $X registry with this line of text, etc. etc.” WHAT. A registry edit? I’ve never done a registry edit before!\n\n“DAD! It says I need to do a registry edit!”\n\n“Oh, that sounds serious,” he says unhelpfully. \n\nFigures I’d get nothing from him. I nervously follow the steps, restart the PC, and…\n\n…it works! I sit back and breathe a huge sigh of relief. Mimi’s $PicApp can be used freely and with all functions. According to the divine forum post, this issue was not uncommon for Vista and the app in question, though that made me wonder why finding the solution was so difficult. Mimi is thrilled of course, and Dad is happy he didn’t have to deal with it for once.\n\nSo what did we learn?\n\n1.\tAlways search the error message, no matter how insignificant.\n\n2.\tNever underestimate a computer problem just because it’s on your grandmother’s PC.\n\n3.\tAnd finally, be very suspicious of your father if he sounds uncharacteristically happy about visiting family.\n",

        "text": "*[Look Here](https://redd.it/7i0esb) for all the stories in chronological order*\n\n\n*I’ve received several questions about how I received my FAA Airframe &amp; Powerplant Certification and became an aircraft mechanic, and this story should hopefully serve as both instruction towards that goal…and maybe a little bit of what **not** to do.*\n\n***\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, at the end of my Army career, I found myself in Fort Campbell, assigned to the 101st Airborne temporarily so that I could out-process from the Army.  I knew that I needed some sort of career prospects, and seeing as how I was already doing online courses towards an aviation maintenance degree and I’d been fixing helicopters for the past few years, I should see about getting my licenses.\n\nI drove down to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and paid a visit to the FAA office there with my personal records in tow.  I’d brought my ERB (Enlisted Record Brief) to prove my length of time in my job and my training record to prove that I was trained in powerplant (engine) repair, as well as my notes on the different tasks I’d done outside my own job area.  The FAA agents gave me a form to fill out on the spot where I was able to fill in my experience and references and signed off on it immediately, providing me with an Authorization to Test.  This authorization meant that I could now go to an examination site and take my written, oral and practical exams to be awarded my licenses and be a fully certificated aviation maintenance technician!\n***\n*Administrative Note: Later on, one of my former Soldiers from when I was in Egypt would later try the same, except he had the misfortune to walk into an FAA office somewhere of a person who was biased against the military and immediately had his application rejected.  He spent the next two years bouncing around from MRO to MRO (Maintenance Repair Organization) as a contractor (ie, subhuman scum to his employers) getting abused and treated overall very poorly trying to earn up the experience he needed to test.*\n\n*When he walked into a different FAA regional office, he brought along all his documentation from the previous years for them to review.  Instead, they merely glanced at his military record and authorized him based off that alone—the previous years were wasted, in a way.  I managed to get him hired in as one of our contractors, and poor guy was like a skittish, beaten dog for a while.  I’m still trying to undo the harm done by that FAA agent and those MROs.*\n***\nOutside the base, there was a small community college that also ran an A&amp;P testing program.  Basically, for a few hundred dollars (reimbursable by the GI Bill/Army Tuition Assistance) I could take two weeks to study the test guides as part of a program and take my written tests.  Once those were complete, I would be able to visit the FAA Designated Examiner with an office in-building and take my Oral and Practical exams.  \n\nThe one problem was…\n\nThe class started at 0700.  Physical Training formation for my unit was at 0630.  \n\nOn the bright side, I was already in ‘out-processing’ which meant I didn’t need to actually *do* PT, just show up in the morning…and then run back to my room, swap into civilian clothes, and then drive like a bat outta hell to the school every morning.  This madness happened for the first few days of the course, until one morning at PT formation , I heard a very, very loud and angry voice call my name.\n\n&gt;**First Sergeant**  “SERGEANT ZEEWULF, GET OVER HERE!”\n\nI immediately dashed up to him and fell into a position of Parade Rest before the First Sergeant, a man who hated the fact that I was here, in his unit, using up one of his valuable NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) slots.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “What can I do for you, First Sergeant?”\n\n&gt;**First Sergeant** “Get lost.  I don’t ever want to see you in my formations again.  I don’t ever want to lay eyes on you.  Go away.”\n\n***\nI mentioned while I was doing this course, I was also supposed to be out-processing from the Army.  Stuff like dropping off my equipment at the Central Issue Facility (CIF—That’ll strike fear into the heart of anyone military.), arranging the moving service or swinging by medical.  I’d sneak the occasional appointment in during lunch, but otherwise I was counting on doing everything else in my last week before I went on Terminal Leave, after I was done with testing.  The two weeks of study and written exams flew by, and I soon was ready to face my Orals and Practicals.  I managed to get in on Monday and Tuesday, which left Wednesday through Friday to finish out-processing.  \n\nThe oral exam was easy-it was just a bunch of questions with lots of “Check the Manual” and anecdotes from stories in the Army, with the examiner providing his own stories.  Day 2 was much, much more of a test, in my opinion—now he wanted to see my ‘skills’ in action. \n\nHe had me do tasks like time a magneto on a reciprocating engine and safety a turnbuckle, and at one point he started leading me towards an engine on the far side of the hangar we were in.  \n\n&gt;**Examiner**  “When we get over there, I want you to look that engine over and tell me three faults it has.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “You mean, that Allision 250?  I can tell you at least ten, standing right here.”\n\nFor the record, the Allision 250 is also known as the Rolls-Royce T703, and is mounted on the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior….and damn near every other small helicopter and plane in existence.  It is, in fact, one of the most ubiquitous and used engines ever—It’s even the main powerplant of a Star Viper!  (Ref-Battlestar Galactica, several seasons, it can be seen on a stand in the background of many hangar scenes)  Needless to say, he didn’t bother leading me any closer and left it at that.  \n\nThere was one test, however, that I was dreading: Sheetmetal.\n\nI’m an engine guy.  Not Arts &amp; Crafts.  I did some structure, enough to get the authorization to test, but it wasn’t pretty—just rebuilding a stringer for a Blackhawk that had a mountain punch through its belly (Why isn’t my weight on wheels light on?  We’re touching down but the wheels aren’t touching!  Let me pound it on the ground a few times…) and helping around with sheetmetal work through the years.  \n\nHe led me over to the sheetmetal tables and handed me a couple pieces of metal.  \n\n&gt;**Examiner** “I want you to put six rivets in that, along the long edge, using proper edge spacing.”\n\nHe left for his office to let me work, with instructions to get him when finished.  I, in my wisdom, took his instructions quite literally, hooked up my air tools to the air compressor lines, and measured out exactly 2.5 rivet diameters between each hole and the edges of the metal—the bare minimum standard edge distance.  And then I drilled and hammered the rivets in place.  \n\nI fetched the examiner, and to his credit once he’d seen my work managed to refrain from facepalming.  \n\n&gt;**Examiner**  “…No.  I meant I want all six rivets down the ENTIRE length of the metal.  Please do it again.”\n\nThis time he stood to wait and watch as I worked, but much to my chagrin after I’d laid out the appropriate rivet pattern and went to drill, my drill started losing power.  I ended up mangling the first hole.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “I don’t get it.  This was working fine earlier.”\n\nThe drill weakly buzzed and died, and I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the air line.  Suddenly, in the back of the shop there was yelling and several guys ran towards the back door carrying a fire extinguisher.  They came back in within a minute and straight over to the table I was working at.\n\n&gt;**Random Guy**  “I’m sorry, the air compressor just caught on fire.  All the air in the hangar is out of order.”\n\nThe examiner looked between me, the metal, the guy and the door leading outside to the compressor.\n\n&gt;**Examiner** *defeated sigh*  I’ll just count this as a pass, let’s move on before something else starts on fire.”\n\n**TL;DR:** When in doubt, start a fire.\n",

        "text": "Was reminded recently of one of my first big oops moments.  Fresh off some Microsoft cert courses I found myself with my first IT job as help desk support for a construction company with offices in Dallas/Austin.  About two months into the job came a day when a support tech was set to look at servicing our AS400 server which I knew nothing about.  The backups were failing and the tech suspected the tape drive.  To confirm he needed to remove it which required a shutdown of the AS400.  Knowing this system was important and used by many of our users in the office for several programs I had the receptionist make an announcement for users to log off (a procedure I had witnessed previously).  After enough time had passed I gave the OK to shut down the server.  The drive was pulled and the server brought back up.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I received a call from my boss who happened to be down in the Austin office for a few days.  He wanted to know why everyone in that office had been kicked off the AS400 and lost their work progress...\n\nNeedless to say my temporary contract was not extended past the 90 day mark.  ",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, mobile, etc. \n\nAs with most people here I am tech support for my family. Although I am not in IT by trade, everyone calls me whenever they have a problem.  Normally I don't mind, but sometimes they give me a laugh. This is one of those times. \n\nMy grandpa had been using a computer from 2003. It took about 2 hours to start up, and would not run for more than 4-5 at one time without cutting off. Fortunately for me, I did not get blamed for this problem, my grandpa was cheap and he knew it. So my dad and I decided to get him a newer refurbished computer on the cheap, slap an SSD in there and he would be good to go for years. We ended up getting him a used workstation which would be harder for him to accidentally kick over like his old one. \n\nSo last weekend I drove up and installed his computer and all his programs and moved all his important files off the old hard drive. We went through how to use everything, and double checked all his files were there. Everything seemed good so I left the next day after a wonderful dinner only grandparents can provide. \n\nOnly an hour after leaving while I'm still on the road, I get a call from him. I'll me $Me and my grandpa will be $GP. \n\n$GP: I just turned the computer back on and it's not starting windows!\n\n$Me: What does it say on the screen?\n\n$GP: It says ... 'Press F1 to continue.' What should I do?\n\n$Me: Press F1. I forgot to change the settings after we transferred the files from your old drive. Sorry about that. \n\n$GP: Do I press F and 1 at the same time??? \n\n$Me: (Trying to contain my laughter) No, just press the F1 key. It's located above the number one, just to the right of the escape key. \n\nEventually he figured it out and had no further problems (so far). It had turned out that after I unplugged his old hard drive we had not turned the computer back on. The motherboard had a feature where if more than one drive was plugged in it would try to open the RAID configurator. Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed my short story.",

It has been a learning process but, I always wanted to try to teach her something from an issue that I tried to fix if I deemed it within reason. Stuff like: \"If the computer says insert disk 2, then insert disk 2\" and progressed from there. And she has learned. At one time I had to visit her because she wanted to transfer video from old VHS tape to her computer and was actually damn close in doing it herself, she just misread a manual and got a wrong component that could not convert the signal correctly. So whenever she calls I start to assume that she at least have tried herself until she felt she could progress no further or had a good idea about the issue.\n\nWith that in mind, I answer the call.\n\n&gt; Me: Hi mom, whats up?\n\n&gt; Mom: Hi, I need to sort this screen cable issue out!\n\nI have recently exchanged my moms big desktop with a small NUC PC and she loves it. Problem is that the only screen outputs are DisplayPort and mini HDMI, but she doesn't want to replace her old screens so I had to come up with DisplayPort to HDMI cable for the first screen, but we never got around to the second. And at this point, I forgot what interfaces the screen had.\n\n&gt; Me: Ahh okay, so the first cable is a DisplayPort to HDMI?\n\n&gt; Mom: You mean the almost square plug to the wide narrow one? Yes.\n\n&gt; Me (Impressed): Ahh good, and do you know what the other output on the NUC is?\n\n&gt; Mom: Yes, it is Mini HDMI.\n\n(Told ya, she is not that lost)\n\n&gt; Me (still impressed): Nice, If you look at the other screen, can you tell me which interfaces that one have?\n\n&gt; Mom: No, I can't.\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, can you take a picture with your phone?\n\n&gt; Mom: No, I can't.\n\n&gt; Me: But You are calling from it!?\n\n&gt; Mom: I am at work, not home!\n\n&gt; Me: FFS MOM!!!\n\nCue me explaining how it was impossible for me to troubleshoot without information and that she just lost 150 points on my mother-knows-IT meter.\n\nEdit Typos: DisplayPort, Cue",

Just when you thought Mondays couldn’t be more crazy, the most unforeseen issues appear from the depths of the wild... \n\nOur cast involves:\n\n$Sleeper - Me (Helpdesk)\n\n$Mags - Accountant\n\n$Bossman - Boss\n\n$Ike - Pro Helpdesk Tech\n\n\nSo, its a typical Monday morning on the helpdesk with phones ringing off the chain. Its been a whopping 9 minutes since I have arrived and $mags calls in. \n\n$sleeper: Good morning, this is $sleeper speaking, how may I help?\n\n$mags: Hey $sleeper, my laptop won’t stop turning off on its own! It’s done it three times in one minute. \n\n$sleeper: Well that’s no good! (Thinking that’s pretty impressive) Let me have $Ike swing by and take a look. \n\n$Ike goes over and takes a good look. Laptop is definitely going to sleep on its own. No sleep buttons or power buttons are being pressed... I check out the event log and it says reason for sleep is lid closed or button pressed.\n\nI went ahead and adjusted power settings so all sleep options are disabled / do nothing. \n\n$mags calls in.... Hey $sleeper. Laptop is not going to sleep anymore, but now blacks out. \n\nEvent logs show the same. Laptop is trying to go to sleep, but no to avail. Ended up calling $LaptopMF and got the “check your drivers” run around. I’m not trying to waste anymore time here, so I spin up a laptop, swap it with $mags. I brought it back to the lab and can’t recreate the issue. All goes well for a few hours.\n\n$mags: Hey $sleeper, sorry to do this but the laptop is still trying to sleep.\n\n$sleeper: (dies inside) of course, I’ll be over shortly. We are going to try a new dock.\n\nEnded up swapping the dock, and right as I was on my escape route, screens go black, and we are back to square one... at this point, its been almost 5 hours and no amount of google foo or vendor support has done the trick. We get together the Helpdesk wizards in one room. \n\n$bossman: What helpdesk issues we got going on fellas? \n\n$sleeper: Got an issue with $mags laptop(s). Computer is going to sleep on its own. Swapped laptop and dock. It also does it when not docked. \n\n$bossman: so its not the computer. Its not the dock. Is has to be.... the user.\n\n$sleeper: whatcha mean $boss?\n\n$boss: you’ve got to figure what it is and what it isn’t. The only thing that it could be, is the user.\n\n$Ike: She’s got a lot of jewelry, she could be hitting the sleep keys.\n\n$Bossman: no not likely, but you say she has a lot of jewelry on?  \n\n$Sleeper: Yeah, probably not hitting the wrong keys. Also turned sleep mode completely off.\n\n$Bossman: Do you think they have magnets on them?\n\n$Ike and $sleeper: Magnets??\n\n$Bossman hands us stylus with magnet end: Take this and run it across the laptop keyboard. \n\n$Ike and myself take stylus to $Mags.\n\n$Sleeper: $mags, we have a theory..\n\n$Mags: Go for it.\n\nI run the stylus across the laptop near the mousepad... computer goes to sleep, and all our mouths drop.\n\n$Sleeper: $Mags.... your bracelet..\n\n$Mags: Yes...\n\n$Sleeper: Does it happen to be magnetic?\n\n$Mags: ..... Yes. Its new!\n\nI turn the laptop back on. \n\n$Sleeper: $Mags, put your bracelet on the laptop near the mousepad.\n\nComputer goes to sleep, $mags jaw drops to the floor.\n\n$Sleeper: Looks like it was the bracelet, not the computer... \n\nToday was a good day :-)\n\nTL:DR User laptop was going to sleep on its own.

Now what do I type.\n\n&gt;$Me- R - E - M - O (She needed everything spelled out)\n\n&gt;$Me- Okay so if you click my name it will download something.\n\n&gt;$CEOW- Oh I see your name $Me, its downloading.\n\n&gt;$Me- Okay when it asks you please make sure you run it when it tells you and it will connect me to you.\n\nWhile this is going on my supervisor is holding back a laugh at how difficult this was. I was being perfectly clear and my supervisor just loves to see me struggle. It had been 20 minutes up to this point. It would only go down hill from here.\n\n&gt;$Me-It should have installed in an instant are you sure its not done?\n\n&gt;$CEOW- It wants me to click run but I don't want a virus.\n\n&gt;$Me- that's a good attitude to have but I need you to run it so I can connect.\n\n&gt;$CEOW- Okay I clicked run.\n\n&gt;$MyInnerThoughts - Finally almost done\n\n&gt;$Me- Okay I should be connected shortly. \n\nIt shows me her screen. I see the word document behind our remote chat screen. I had finally made it in. She wanted to minimize the chat window. It happened too fast before I could react. She hit the **END SESSION** button instead. My Supervisor is starting to laugh and ran out of the room. I could still hear him in the hall just busting up laughing. \n\n&gt;$Me- Wait $CEOW, you ended the session, I can't see your screen anymore. \n\n&gt;$CEOW- I didn't do anything, I just want this to be single spaced anyway. Just help me.\n\nI had to spend another 5 minutes getting the connection back.\n\nThe rest of the call is my showing her how to set it to single spaced and removing the default space after a line break. Every time I would show her how to do it she would select everything and hit delete and type again and would get mad at me saying it didn't work. I made those her default document settings and was finally able to leave. My coworker and boss both were laughing about this for this last week. What should have been one of the easiest fixes took a 45 minute call. \n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "How was your start of the week? Mine featured a WhatsApp voice message from my dad telling me his WiFi is down, and if I can please call him. My girlfriend tells me I should call him, so I reluctantly do.\n\nTurns out he can't see his WiFi at all. So that's weird. I ask him to unplug and plug his router. \"What, the yellow cable?\". No, dad, that's the internet cable, leave it where it was. Ok, I don't care if you had it plugged directly to the computer to bypass the router, that's not what I meant. No, the blue cable isn't the one either. The power cable. Yes, the black one. Thank you. \n\nRouter reboots and the WiFi is still not there. Ok, what networks do you see? \"There's a TPLINK-something, I thought it looked suspicious because it's new and it has a lot of signal\". Yes, that's your router, it got factory reset somehow. Let's set it up. So I tell him to plug everything back into the router. The cable from the ISP modem into the WAN port, the cable to the computer into one of the other ports. Yes, I'm sure that's how it works. Yes. No, it doesn't matter that the WAN port is painted yellow and the cable to the computer is yellow and the LAN ports are painted blue and the cable to the modem is blue. No, I'm sure it wasn't always like that. Look, last time your internet was down it was because you had it plugged in backwards, so just trust me on this, ok.\n\nSo computer plugged in, I tell him to go to open a browser, go to 192.168.0.1. Keyboard doesn't work. He jiggles the connector, lights turn on, then off, still doesn't work. Turns out it's an older PS/2 keyboard. Yes, my dad doesn't do bleeding edge tech. I tell him to make sure it's plugged in to the keyboard connector (PS/2 mouse connectors are identical, right? or at least I seem to remember that). Turns out a few of the \"legs\" of the connector are broken, so he needs to go see if he has another keyboard and he'll call me back.\n\nOk, so time to try to get the kid ready for daycare. We're already way too late. She's already dressed, pooping, when grandpa calls again. We get the \"I want to talk to the girl\" part out, then resume. Connect to the router setup page, it won't load. Check network settings, while I google \"windows 7 network settings\" to see what he should be seeing (I've been using linux exclusively for over a decade, I have no idea how windows network settigns look), everything seems fine. Still, router setup doesn't load. \n\nThen a voice inside my head tells me it has to be something in the browser blocking it. Maybe some extension, or maybe some shady thing my dad installed? No idea. Try ctrl-shift-N, type 192.168.0.1 there. And it loaded. Use username and password admin/admin, then go to quick setup (fortunately all these tplink routers have the same crappy menu, so I can basically do it in my sleep). Select PPPoE, then username password. What do you mean you don't know? It's your password. Yes, the one the ISP gave you. Ok, good, you found it. Then the SSID, security, etc, reboot. It worked, awesome!\n\nSo now I want to prevent this from happening again. My theory is that there's a mess of tangled cables and that the router was probably hanging from the table (the mess of tangled cables is a reality, the router hanging is an educated guess), and somehow the reset button got pressed against the mess of cables. So I start telling him that there's this button and he interrupts me. \"Oh, yes, the one that resets the router. Sometimes the Chromecast tells me it has no internet connection and I should try restarting the router, so I press that button. It doesn't do anything.\" So apparently my dad has been pressing the factory reset button on his router regularly to restart it, which doesn't work. The button does nothing unless you keep it pressed, so it didn't cause any issues, until maybe he pressed it for a little too long or something, and the router got factory reset.\n\n*sigh* I told him that from now on he should just unplug it and plug it again if he needs to restart it for any reason. And I'm just now realizing I still don't know why the router setup page wouldn't load except in incognito mode.",

The software doesn't play nice with other software packages or settings that shift resource demand so we require people to run a low-end standalone workstation with non-essential processes turned off. We send out a document to all our tool owners with instructions on how to set up their control PC.\n\nThis doesn't stop people from ignoring our advice.\n\n---\nThe coffee is flowing, the day is going smoothly, keeping the call queue empty. A call rolls in - \n&gt; $Me - Good afternoon, Technician /u/SocksTheFox here.\n&gt;\n&gt; $Cust - Yeah, I'm having an issue with my machine not cutting consistently. \n&gt; \n&gt; $Me - Can you send me a picture with some more info to describe what is going on?\n&gt; \n&gt; $Cust - Sure, I'll email them over \n\n___\nThe customer sends the pic and it's fairly obvious something is happening on his computer in the middle of his operation. I suspect the computer is going to sleep or there is a program running. So I get ready to send him our computer setup doc but I notice another ticket in this customers history\n\n___\n\n&gt; $Me - OK, I got the pictures and know what's happening, but I see that someone here spoke with you in the past about a similar issue and sent over our computer setup notes. How did that process go?\n&gt; \n&gt; $Cust - Yeah I did everything in there and it didn't help.\n&gt; \n&gt; $Me - (Me thinking, 'Yeah, OK sure you did'), OK well why don't we get a remote session set up so I can see what you are seeing\n___\n\nI get remotted in to his PC after a little back and forth and get the pleasure of staring down the full Norton suite (Antivirus is a no-no with our software, the document actually says in big red bolded letters to fully uninstall anything that isn't Windows Defender lest your tool not work right)\n\n___\n&gt; $Me - OK I see that we still have a 3rd Party Antivirus installed on this PC which we need to remove according to our PC Setup Doc, what happened?\n&gt; \n&gt; $Cust - Well it was on there when I bought the computer so I thought it was important to keep.\n&gt; \n&gt; $Me - (thinking 'Yeah right you didn't even read the doc') - OK well why don't I run through these steps and make sure your PC isn't going to affect the operation of the tool.\n\n___\nI take about 10 minutes to turn some processes off, uninstall Norton and fix his Power Settings.\n\n___\n&gt; $Me - OK everything is set up, you should be good to try the tool out again\n\n___ \nthe customer thanks me for my time and is off\n\nLater that day we get an email in the support box from the customer saying:\n\n&gt; $Cust - \"Wow the tool is running great! Must have been a glitch, thanks so much!!!\"\n\nI really wanted to reply that, no, the tool did not have a glitch, your brain had a glitch when it heard that it needed to follow instructions ya' dingus.\n\n___\n\nAnd now time for another cup of java.",

Since you do not wish to do the troubleshooting to fix the issue; and since you have a great deal of technical knowledge as you’ve mentioned, it sounds like you have that issue well in hand.

If you have a problem with your computer or printer or something, you call me and I come to your house to fix it. The ideal side job for an IT student.\n\nLast week I was installing Windows 10 at a woman's computer. She (50 years old) mentioned her mom (75 years old) had a slow laptop and wanted me to also look into that. To prepare for that, she called her mom to get some information about the laptop (I don't need that to fix her laptop and mentioned that, but she wanted to do it anyway, so whatever).\nHer mom could not send her a picture of the laptop, since she had an old fashioned cellphone. Instead she had to just read out all information on the laptop, so her daughter could write it down and give it to me.\n\nI said it was mostly useful to get the brand and the model, and said that on the top of the laptop the brand was probably written. The daughter asks this and repeats after her mom: \"On the top it says s-n-s-v\". My brain starts spinning. I don't know all laptop brands, but I'm pretty sure I know about 90-95% of what is normally bought. But I have never heard of a snsv brand.\nThen it clicks and I try to hold my laughter, which doesn't go so well. The mother was reading it upside down and was just in possession of an Asus laptop.\nI mention it and luckily they could both also laugh about it.",

        "text": "So, I work for a tech company offering support to clients that are fairly non-Tech friendly.  One day we had a client come in to pickup her computer that she dropped off.  Looking at it I saw she dropped it off earlier in the day and had paid an expedited fee to be worked on immediately as if she didn’t it would have been almost half a week as we were back logged.  This lady from the start was impatient as I helped someone else so I started to multi task with her and her pickup.  The notes stated she wanted us to diag why her machine wasn’t working/ having weird boot problems and after running our diag the hard drive failed as well as some weird problems for motherboard tests.  Not exactly a fail but just some red flags.  The machine was opened up and it was noted that the capacitors on the motherboard were bulging and some had leaked.  So, a new motherboard was quoted and a hard drive however this was a Windows XP machine that clearly had seen better days.  \nI explained to her the hard drive and when I got to motherboard she went on about how her “IT friend” had looked it over with her and how it was perfectly fine and all the capacitors were no issues and wanted to know what I was talking about.  She began to get frustrated and I offered to open the computer for her and look at it with her as she was adamant.  I opened the machine and almost all the capacitors around the CPU had leaked and some were even rusting and corroding as how bad they were.  She immediately threw into a fit and demanded we replaced her “new XP machine” and when I told her there was no way it could be new as this damage happens over a period of time she started pounding on the counter and demanding we fix it or replace it.  I was still with another client so I told her as she was screaming at this point she would wait for me to finish and she could yell afterwards at me but it wasn’t fair to him.  She began to pound on the counter and knock our flyers off the desk and at that point I called a manger over because of how erratic she was getting.\nManger comes over and it goes something like this.\n\n&gt;C: Your technicians are horrible they broke my machine it was perfectly fine and they broke it.\n\n&gt;M: Whats the problem.\n\n&gt;C: The capacitors they broken them all back there see, power it on and see it should work.  It only had a program boot problem.\n\n&gt;M: This clearly isn’t something new you can see the rust and corrosion.  \n\n&gt;C: I am electronics engineer and they were fine I examined this thing.  You need to fix it and im not leaving.  You want me to leave call the cops.\n\n&gt;M: Look were not fixing it.\n\n&gt;C: Then call the cops because you’re a big thief.\n\n&gt;M: Okay fine (Manager proceeds to call the non-emergency number)\n\n&gt;C: Talks on phone with who I assume is a police officer explaining the same story.\n\n(hands phone back to manager)\n\n&gt;C:  You only called them because im black. That is no way to deal with a customer you are not professional.  If i wanted them i could have called them on my phone.\n\n&gt;M: I am sorry you feel that way.\n\n(client storms out with her PC now)\n\nI show up next morning and this lady is in speaking with another manager about the previous night about how she was so polite and he was rude and called police.\n\nOther manager refunds money to customer -_- .  They said why argue with someone so irrational, if it makes her feel better it isn’t worth the fight.\n\nBackground information:\n\nWe don’t work on XP machines as most of the tools we are allowed to use don’t really play nice and the last time we accepted one we had a pain getting it to activated and Microsoft was less than helpful so it became a rule.  If it isn’t supported by Microsoft it isn’t worth the pain.  She was also mad because no tools are sold in the store to fix her XP machine as it isn’t old all the financial industry apparently still uses them.  We knew it was XP but she was apparently so persistent that we diag it for her before she bought a new pc.\n\n\n\n\nNot very good a story telling but this was too good to not share.\n",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, all that jazz.\nThis was from many a year ago. More specifically, when most of you were still youngsters.\n\nThis isn't necessarily tech support, but I am a technician at the local telephone company central office. My first year at Bell East-Coast Ocean (now Big Red Check) was rather uneventful until the news that we would be installing a new switchboard came. I was the junior technician at the central office, so I figured it would be my chance to \"shine\". With my training fresh in mind, and the old switchboard almost entirely disconnected, we began to make the (what we thought was) seamless transition over to the new fully automatic one easy. \nUntil I tripped.\nYes, that's right. We had the lines at a point that if you yanked the frail primary copper line, it would disconnect from the board. Unfortunately, this is what I tripped over. I hit my head pretty hard on the old Western Electric equipment too. My coworkers got to work immediately to reconnect the lines, while I went out to test. I picked up the phone we had in the service room. \n\nNo dial tone.\n \nThat's a problem. Once everything was connected, the phone began to ring off the hook. People were complaining that their conversations were cut off, their internet disconnected, their heart monitors weren't sending information. It was then we  realized we (more like I) had accidentally cut phone service to the entire local office area for around 3 minutes. My boss wanted to see me and fearing reprimanding, I went in with my head down. I got much worse. I was placed back into installs and field repairs. I am still in this position today, 23 years later.  ",

        "text": "Detective Y7 sits down at the desk. His two assistants sit next to him, on his left side. He leans back. The chair snaps. He gets another, but that one snaps too. He finds the perfect chair, and delicately rests back into it, ready to get to work.\n\nHe finds before him the Windows login screen. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to login. Pretty standard stuff. He hits the buttons. Doesn't work. Doesn't work twice. Moves which USB port the keyboard is in, and jiggles it a bit. Tries again.\n\nHe's in, and on a roll now. He starts typing in his username, finger-poking each key one at a time, step by step, second by second. It takes time, but it doesn't matter - you can't rush perfection.\n\nUsername finished. He slowly moves his hand to grab the mouse, moves it just below where he entered his username, and... nothing. Hm. There's no password box anywhere to be seen. He clicks around for a while - maybe it's in the top right, or the bottom left, maybe he just has to click where it normally is and enter normally - yet, through all his best efforts, he can't seem to find the password box.\n\nMaybe it's just a temporary thing. He waits a few seconds - no, no, it can't be that - that would be too obvious. He has a revelation - maybe it's just not loading, and he needs to back out and go back into the login screen. He tries it - he cautiously moves his mouse over to the back button, and tries the entire process again. CTRL+ALT+DELETE - check. Username - check. Password - no luck.\n\nWell, third time's the charm, so he tries again. CTRL+ALT+DELETE - bingo. Username - done. Password - nada.\n\nHe wipes his head. He's running out of ideas. He tries restarting his monitor - no go. Taking out and putting in the keyboard? Nothing. Mouse? Nah.\n\nHis assistants notice his struggles. They begin to aid Y7 in working out this devious device. The first assistant yells out, and tells him to simply hit CTRL+ALT+DELETE. He replies that there's no password box. The second assistant suggests trying again, but alas, the trio still have no such luck.\n\nNew clues are being uncovered by the second. There's a big picture in the way when you get to the login - maybe that's covering the password box? They click, drag, scroll, type, spam all over this bizarre imagery obstructing their progress, but yet still they make no progress.\n\nThe assistant suggests restarting the computer - it could be a bug. Y7 agrees, and clicks the blue button in the bottom left. A menu pops up, with lots of boxes and buttons. He's not certain on how to operate this - it is truly unmarked territory. He clicks on the first button. Nothing. He clicks the second. A spike of lag, but nothing of interest. The last one just closes the window.\n\nY7 decides to take a risk - he checks all of the boxes, and hits the second button again. The lag is longer this time, raging on for an eternity, but it finally ceases. The blue screen has turned black and purple, the clean appearance has transformed into a demonic mosaic of windows, buttons, toolbars, options, possibilities. A deep, horrific voice throws curses at Y7. He quickly realises his mistake, unchecks all the boxes and hits the second button one final time. The torture ends, and the blue login page is restored.\n\nY7 is truly stumped. Has he finally come against his final match? An enemy so powerful, that not even the claw from Satan's hand could destroy it? Has he found what is truly unbeatable, absolutely indestructable, so tough that even the stronges-\n\n\"Oh, yeah, that one's locked. You can't use it. Go find another.\"\n\nAnother problem solved. I go back to osu!mania. Another ruined combo - two minutes in, too. I can't believe that this song is five minutes long! It's seriously, truly ridiculous...",

I have a shipping computer that runs software from major $Vendor.  We have been using a older version of the software for a few *years* now and it's long time to upgrade not only the software, but the machine as well.\n\nNew machine has been acquired and the latest software from $Vendor has been downloaded and installed.

So, here is the exchange....\n\n&gt; $Vendor: This is Steve.\n\nUm, yeah, right.\n\n&gt; $Me: Yes, I am unable to authenticate the software.

So, I relay this information to the $Vendor.\n\n&gt; $Vendor: Ok, I will need to call the number on the account and verify some information.\n\nThat's fine...whatever.  So, he puts me on hold and I wait a minute and hear this over the PA...\n\n&gt; $Secretary: /u/zygntwin, Line 2\n\nNo...couldn't be.  So, I place the current line on hold and picked up the second line...\n\n&gt; $Vendor:  Yes, this is Steve from $Vendor and I just need to verify if you have an employee by the name of /u/zygntwin?\n\n&gt; $Me:  Yup\n\n&gt; $Vendor:  Ok, that's all I needed.  Thank you very much and have a nice day.\n\nHang up the second line and took the first line off hold.  $Vendor comes back on the line...\n\n&gt; $Vendor:  Ok, I have verified the information correctly and will authenticate the software for you.  Have a nice day.\n\nWell, that was easy...Didn't even change my voice.  Go figure.\n",

This is another event that happened during that time. $Selben arrived in the office, the building was still a bit eerie to him as he approached. Entering through the side door he could hear $Scoff’s TV show along with the night janitorial services running industrial vacuums in the distance. He walked up to his desk to find a decapitated gummy-bear lying on top of a post-it, $Snickers handwriting was atrocious;\n\n&gt; $Snickers Note: Left cheese in freezer - for you! Lonely and bored - heres a sacifios!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Cheese… Sacifios?… Oh, Sacrifice!\n\n$Selben recalled $Snickers had been talking about learning to make cheese in a cooking class and assumed that’s what he meant… And then there was the gummy bear…\n\n&gt; $Scoff: What cheese are we sacrificing?\n\n$Selben looked up, $Scoff had wandered over to $Selbens cube and was leaning against the wall.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Nothing… What’s up?\n\n$Selben dropped the sugary gummy corpse in the trash.\n\n&gt; $Scoff: Like, that email doesn’t make sense.\n\n$Selben couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow at the lack of information.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Email from?…\n\n&gt; $Scoff: (Scoffed) The email from $Sup2… Duh… Passwords or something?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Scoff wandered back to his seat, or so $Selben assumed. Pulling up his emails, $Selben found the one marked critical from $Sup2. It simply said there were a series of possible security breaches and they would be putting into place a much improved set of rules for the security policy regarding passwords. $Selben nodded to himself, it made sense and was fairly straightforward, at midnight the changes would take effect - so he would need to work with $Scoff to change some of the passwords used to access assorted internal systems. After a substantial amount of ‘sigh’ and ‘scoffs’ - $Scoff simply said ‘Whatever’.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe email had been sent out company-wide - explaining people would be required to change their password and the new rules (Cannot reuse an old password, can’t include your name, needs to include numbers and letters etc…) This was a substantial change compared to the old policy during which ‘password’ was commonplace.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe phones rang occasionally and were mostly panicked office managers who had nothing better to do beyond checking their emails at 9pm at night, $Selben was able to easily talk them off the edge and gave some suggestions for their passwords. Shortly after midnight things got fairly quiet, $Selben stopped by $Scoff’s desk to see what he had changed the logins for the internal systems to, he needed to record them so they could access the systems during the day as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; $Selben: Can I get that list of passwords, so I can update the main list?\n\n&gt; $Scoff: Em… About that… It wont let me.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Won’t let you?..\n\n$Scoff pulled up the AD tools and entered a password for one of the service accounts. ‘Error: Password does not meet the current security requirements.’\n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay… What are you using?\n\n&gt; $Scoff: Password2 (I swear it wasn’t this, but really close.)\n\n&gt; $Selben: That wont work… It needs to be 10 characters and have numbers as well as capitals.\n\n$Scoff tried several more times and eventually let out a sigh and got out of his chair, indicating $Selben should do it.\n\n$Selben created a password easily ‘Never Eat Shredded Wheat…1234!’NESW01234!’\n\n&gt; $Selben: See, just use a common phrase or a mnemonic phrase.\n\n$Scoff was still confused and headed towards the kitchen, $Selben followed - they were having an argument about the policy being ‘Stupid’ - compared to it being a ‘Smart change for once.’ $Scoff grabbed a cup then went for some ice, he swung open the door to the freezer and $Selben made a realization and spoke quickly.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Don’t drop the frozen cheese!!!\n\n&gt; $Scoff: That’s a weird password isn’t?… OUCH!!!\n\nLuckily $Scoff did not actually get injured, the 2 lbs frozen wheel of cheese in the freezer had fallen out and landed squarely on his foot. However for the next couple years, DDTFC1234! was the password for one of the service passwords. ",

        "text": "Gather 'round young ones while I tell you a tale.  This hearkens back to the days when dial-up Internet was your only option, home computers were sold in cow-themed boxes, and Computer Shopper was a magazine so thick it could be used for home defense.\n\nA little background to get us started.  Shortly after I started in IT in 1993, our department was moved from inside the hospital to a building about 2 blocks away.  It was to be a temporary move (HA!) that would only last 18 months.  Eight years later, we moved back inside the hospital.  Here is our story of how that happened.  \n\nIt was a known complaint that we needed to be inside the hospital, since that is where all of the users were.  But here we were, walking 2 blocks in the wind, rain, snow, and ice to service printers, replace dumb terminals, and troubleshoot network issues.  At the time, 95% of our system was a mainframe in another city, and we were just client devices off of the mainframe.  We had a few small 3-5 user Novell networks, but nothing too big.  \n\nAs time passed, we started seeing more and more PCs rather than dumb terminals.  Finally, a decison was made that we needed to consolidate the growing Novell networks into one system.  As 250-user single server. I was now working days, and was made our site admin for this project, and would be given all the training I could handle.  Our main financial and patient systems were still mainframe, but we used terminal emulation software on the PCs to access these.  \n\nTwo things led to our move back to the hospital.  The first was by design.  My design, from my dark evil lair.  \n\nWe were migrating to a new M$ Office suite.  As part of this, we required that *everyone* go through training since we would be moving from text-based mainframe email to $Lookout email.  We spend 6 months running all of the staff through classes in our crappy building.  Heat and cooling were inadequate in our building due to the age, and the fact that it was chopped up and walls moved with no planning for HVAC zones.  I had complained multiple times to our administration, but we were not a priority.  Since we weren't, they weren't.  I planned them last in the migration to the new office suite.  I scheduled them for 2-hour afternoon class.  In August.  In a training room that faced the west side of the building.  Temperatures on the desktop in that room consistently reached around 100-105 degrees by 2:00.  \n\nWhen the class was over, and our senior leadership team was drenched in sweat, and had a whole new understanding of our complaints about the building.  Yes, I am evil.  I know this, and now they do.  I also scheduled them for various classes in the same room for morning in the winter months.  You could *almost* see your breath in the room.  Too bad they coudl not type with their gloves one.  \n\nThe final event that helped us move back into the main building was out of our control, but we made some sweet lemonade out of lemons.  Since this was an old building, and we were leasing space, we did not have generator power in this building.  We relied on UPS units to maintain power on our file servers that housed our local applications, including our terminal emulation software.  Payroll was run every two weeks on a Monday.  Payroll was managed on the mainframe which required terminal emulation software.  Power company had a multiple zone power outage that just so happened to land on a Monday.  A payroll Monday.  \n\nI watched as the last LED on the UPS for the file server slowly faded away.  It was dark in the room where the servers were.  It was also eerily quiet.  Then the phone rings.  Payroll clerks were complaining.  Sorry, out of my control.  Executives call:  What can we do?  Buy a time machine, go back, and listen when we said that this was a setup doomed to failure?  Best advice I coudl give was to stick payroll staff in any office in the hospital where someone was on vacation and hope for fast data entry.  \n\nThe next week, it was announced that we would start renovating an area for a server room in the main hospital that included generator power.  \n\nPatience is a virtue.",

        "text": "Hi there, I'm back again with another tale! I always told myself after my last post, [World time affecting Internet Speeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/78easc/world_time_affecting_internet_speeds/) I'd come back for another post. Well, sadly nothing that interesting has happened and in my opinion I don't really want to post here until I can make you guys laugh. Well, today I've got one that will by god tickle your funny bones more than it probably should.\n\n**———**\n\n**Background on me:** Can be found on [World time affecting Internet Speeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/78easc/world_time_affecting_internet_speeds/)\n\n**Update on me:** I've settled into the job quite nicely now, I've took my Microsoft Exams and smashed them, I'm well on my way to finishing them (and my apprenticeship) and it's not going to stop me from getting my MCP status. I'll take all the Microsoft exams I have to so I can get there and further my knowledge!\n\nWe have customers that have all sorts of different backup solutions and software. This can range from simple tape backups using BackupExec or more complicated on-site/off-site backups with Altaro or Veeam. Today I got a phonecall, and honestly, I was crying in my chair with laughter, I just didn't think I'd ever get this call..\n\n**———**\n\nFor the purpose of this let's go with:\n&gt; $me - *IT Apprentice*\n\n&gt; $msp - *My manage service provider company*\n\n&gt; $cust - *The customer who has called*\n\n&gt; $cust2 - *The other employee working with $cust*\n\n**———**\n\n&gt; **$me**: Good morning $msp, $me speaking how can I help?\n\n&gt; **$cust**: Hi there $me, it's $cust calling from $cust I've got a problem with this backup drive from last night?\n\n&gt; **$me**: Not to worry. Do you know what type of drive it is? External hard drive? Tape?\n\n&gt; **$cust**: Yeah I think the gal told me it was an RDX drive?\n\n&gt; **$me**: Yeah RDX drive sounds about right. So $cust, what's the problem?\n\n&gt; **$cust**: Well, it wouldn't come out this morning, I tried all sorts. I'm pretty new to this, in fact its my first time dealing with this RDX backup drive. The two girls who used to do it have left and now me and $cust2 have to take over but we've got no idea how it works - no one ran it past us.\n\n&gt; **$me**: Okay, not to worry I can give you some more information about the RDX backup after we have got this sorted out. \n\n&gt; **$cust**: Yeah that'd be great cheers pal. So shall I tell you a bit about what happened this morning?\n\n&gt; **$me**: That'd be great, start from the beginning if you can please with as much information as possible.\n\n&gt; **$cust2** *[Quite faint in the background]*: Make sure to tell him about the vaseline\n\n&gt; **$cust**: Yeah don't worry I'll tell him everything\n\n&gt; **$me** *[Pretty shook at the fact I've heard the man mention vasaline now..]*\n\n&gt; **$cust**: So the drive wouldn't come out mate, I've spent all morning trying to get the damn thing out. The girl who left literally told me to come in every morning, take it out and push the new one in. Simple as that.\n\n&gt; **$me**: Yeah that sounds about right she's given you the right information so far. There is a bit more after that you need to know but we can get to that.\n\n&gt; **$cust**: Well yeah you can explain that after, I need you to sort out this now though. I can't get it out, there's no enject button like a disk drive in your PC or on your XBOX like what kind of f******* s*** piece of hardware is this?\n\n&gt; **$me**: Well RDX drives will automatically eject themselves when the job is finished, you can manually eject them using a reset button at the back but we don't recommend it incase a job is still running. Let me see if the job is sti-\n\n&gt; **$cust2** *[Extremely loud crack, shouting in the background, sounding quite pleased about himself]*: DON'T WORRY $cust, I'VE F******** GOT IT! DON'T NEED $msp ANYMORE I'M A BOSS!\n\n&gt; **$cust**: Okay.. Urm.. $me, we have a problem now.\n\n&gt; **$me**: Urm, did $cust2 just do what I think he did?\n\n&gt; **$cust**: He smoothered the RDX drive and his rulers in vaseline, pronged two rulers down the side and he's pulled it out $me..\n\n&gt; **$me** *[What the f****k??]*: Wait.. Seriously? He covered it in vasaline and pulled the RDX drive out?\n\n&gt; **$cust** *[Extremely disapointed with $cust2]*: Yeah.. I tell you what, send me a quote for a new RDX system and drive please. Can you arrange to come out and teach us how to use it properly too? Cheers mate. \n\n**———**\n\nI think its fair to say that honestly, I couldn't contain myself this was something I never expected to have a call like this, nor do I ever expect to get one later on in my career but by god I f****** hope that I do. I'm currently on my way there, to access the damage and see if a new RDX system is actually needed.\n\nNeedless to say, after speaking with $cust regarding $cust2, he's no longer allowed to look after the backups.",

I inform her again that she cannot access other users folders.\nOMGUSER: why not, I should have complete access to everything\nMpodalP : no you don't.\nEnter: DR Fussypants: ( OMGUSER works for DR Fussypants)  explain that OMGUSER is scanning to someone else's folder, no big deal.

I que:idgaf, shrug my way out while DR Fussypants is tearing OMGUSER a new porthole...  \n\nAnd finally; OMGUSER seems like a sweet lady, just a little dim, I'm really not trying to give her a hard time.

He not them decides on the right one for them. He buys a new server and 2 workstations to the tune of 10k.\n\nHe comes in a couple of weeks after hardware arrives and sets up the network and installs software. Fast forward a little over a year. Hey we have these computers nephew bought, we don't have the program up and running can you help us? Sure go to log into server does anyone have the password to server? A day later they find it. Go to log into program, nope no license key. Call the company, sure we can provide you with the key just pony up close to 1k for 1 yr of tech support cause nephew never got it.\n\nWe want last years data in the system too. Well that's gonna take some time. A few weeks later I get it done and they just have to enter in last 2 months. Ok thanks we'll take it from here, great I hate this program.\n\nFast forward 1 yr. or so. Hey we never got around to doing that can you enter in all the back data to catch us up. Sure whatever money is money. Ok all you have left to do is enter in this month and you're good to go.\n \nGet a call the 1st of the year is coming up can we just start running that program as of then? This program is picky once you set a date to start that's it. Either enter in all old data or roll back if you can. If not you have to start all over. Let me see what backups you have maybe we can use one and just adjust the rent and enter in new tenants.\nGo to office where do you keep the backups? On this Dell usb drive uh don't see it here. Plug it into another port nothing, another computer nothing great. Get back check some of my old backups and find 2 one for condos one for apartments. Ok this may work. Send them an email with condo database backup. It's labeled CONDO and I tell them you have to restore the condo database.\n\nText me I can't unzip it. You don't unzip you restore it. Ok. I restored database it's still showing entries for rent etc. If you restored the condo database and it's still showing entries then the restore didn't take. I'll see if I can find another solution. The condo database, oh I didn't check the condo database.I'll check it in the morning. Yes these are the people I have to deal with.",

        "text": "Oh hey.\n\nTime for another story from my life as a network engineer(NE).\nThis one happened a while ago, when my employer was building a brand new R&amp;D campus which of course had to be provided with a network. When building campus networks, an even remotely sane NE will do subnetting. This means provide each and every building with it's own IP address range(s).\n\nE.g.\n\n* 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 for building A\n\n* 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255 for building B\n\n* 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.255 for Servers\n\nand so on.\n\nWhat we also do here is reserve parts of these address ranges for our switches in order to manage them remotely (yeah, we don't have a management VLAN, but the reorganized design team finally realized that it might be a good idea to have one).\n\nIn the case of this story, it was somewhere like this:\n\nNetwork 192.168.10.0-255 separated into 192.168.10.1 to 25 for network components and 26 to 255 for servers to be used.\n\nAll was well documented and communicated.\n\nPeople involved:\n\n$SOP: Server Operator (not the same one as in the last story, but his direct colleague)\n\n$GL: My group leader (2nd level leader)\n\nPhrewfuf: Yours truly.\n\nI sit at my desk, minding my own business, my colleagues all out for lunch, when $SOP hastily walks into our office.\n\n&gt; $SOP: Is anyone here? I need help with the network!\n\n&gt; Phrewfuf: 'sup? What's wrong?\n\n&gt; $SOP: Ah, hi $Phrewfuf. The network at the new location is broken or you changed something. *at this point i casually opened my monitoring to ~~hide that i'm reading TFTS~~ check if there is actually anything wrong with the net.*\n\n&gt; Phrewfuf: All looking good over here, no issues. What exactly is wrong anyways? Are there any tickets?\n\n&gt; $SOP: No, no tickets. The local directory server is not reachable any more. You must have changed some filter or some firewall. You need to revert that ASAP. Why would you install filter rules that block our server????!!! *of course i knew he was going to blame the firewall*\n\n&gt; Phrewfuf: Hm. Well, you see, i'm kind of busy right now, so i'll need a ticket with a detailed problem description assigned to my solution group, before i can do anything. I'll need all the info. IP-addresses, what's working, what's not working etc.\n\n&gt; $SOP: BUT IT'S URGENT! I can't access the server any more, your firewall is blocking it.\n\n&gt; Phrewfuf: Well, then why are you still standing here, the faster you give me a ticket, the faster i will solve your issue.\n\n&gt; $SOP storms off.\n\nFive minutes later i get a notification about a new ticket in my queue. And yes, he even provided all the info i needed. The directory server has the IP 192.168.10.15 - did you notice? -  and was working fine until half an hour ago, when it stopped replying to anything but pings. Inb4 \"He was right, it was the firewall!\": Nope. He wasn't and it wasn't.\n\nWhen i saw the IP address and knew that it - as the IP address, not the server - was replying to pings, i knew what happened. \n\nYou see...the network on this campus was still in construction, including the server network. Not all switches were installed, but they were already configured. And that day, some additional switches were installed in the server network. Now here's a riddle for you: Which device can reply to an ARP request (resolution of IPs to MAC-Addresses) faster than a server?\n\nI start nmap and scan the IP for open ports. Alas, for some reason, the windows server is listening on port 22. Very unusual that a windows server stops listening to RDP and starts listening to SSH. Did it suddenly transform into a linux box, because of some personality issues? I connect to this IP via SSH using my network management user. The device tells me that its uptime is about half an hour.\n\nI throw in a screenshot of the nmap into the ticket. Also add one of our network documentation which $SOP has access to anyways.\n\nTicket resolution: Handling, User error.\n\nResolution text:\n\n&gt; The server is unreachable because it was setup with an IP address that was reserved for network components. There were some switches installed today in the server network, and the network doesn't like having duplicate IPs. The switch just responds faster to any requests than your server. Please reconfigure.\n\nEmail from Phrewfuf to $GL and $SOP:\n\n&gt; Hi $GL, i had a clash with &lt;$SOPs department&gt; today, regarding ticket #xxxx. For some reason they ignored the documentation and installed a server using an IP reserved for our hardware, which of course led to the server becoming unresponsive. Additionally $SOP came to me and started blaming firewalls and filters that were configured incorrectly. In regard of the time $SOP has been working in IT at this company, *i coincidentally happened to know it as i spent a few months working in &lt;$SOPs department&gt; during my apprenticeship* he should know that there are no firewalls or filters within our internal company network. And he should know better than to come into our office, ignoring the ticket process and starting to blame us for breaking his systems. If he needs help, he can come and ask for help, but i expect people wanting my help to be friendly to me.\n\nThere was another email from $GL, but i don't remember what he wrote. Though i do remember that i was happy with his response.\n\n**TL;DR**: Windows Server suddenly acts like a linux box. Non-existing firewalls are blamed. Someone gets a paddlin'.\n\nPrevious Stories:\n\n* [Don't do the thing - Oops, i did the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4eqzlr/guys_dont_do_the_thing_it_breaks_stuff_oh_i_did/)\n\n* [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/)",

This hearkens back to the days when dial-up Internet was your only option, home computers were sold in cow-themed boxes, and Computer Shopper was a magazine so thick it could be used for home defense.\n\nCast of Characters:\n&gt;$me:  Then, a fresh young computer geek ready to conquer the world.  Now, a wisened, cynical IT professional.\n&gt;$nurse:  Close friend of mine.  \n$sbil: $nurse's Stupid Brother-in-Law  \n\nIt was a pleasant Fall day in the mid 1990's.  Our hero, $me, was enjoying a weekend with little to do but game and play around on AOL.  I know, but I was young and didn't know any better.  \n\nMy Nokia brick of a cell phone rings, and $nurse is on the line.  Seems like her daughter had received a webcam for her birthday, and they were having issues.  \n\n&gt;$me:  What kind of problem?  \n$nurse:  Well, $sbil bought her a webcam. We got it hooked up, and he said he knew how to install it.  \n&gt;$me: &lt;inner monologue&gt;hmmm.  I've met $sbil.  He could not install lint in his own pocket.  Sure he can install a webcam.  \n&gt;$me: $nurse, what kind of problem are you having?  \n&gt;$nurse:  When we open the software and click on the button to take a picture, the computer reboots?  What would cause that?  \n&gt;$me:  Nothing in a normal universe would cause that behavior.  I will come over.  \n\nI drive  5 minutes to $nurse's house.  I walk into the birthday party finishing up, and $sbil sees me.  \n\n&gt;$sbil:  Camera must be bad.  I will take it back and get a new one.  I know I did it right.  I know about computers.  I use one at work all the time.  \n$me:  Let me see what the issue is.  You stay downstairs and I will go look at it.  \n\nI get to the computer and check it out.  It is a $well_thought_out_tech camera that connects to the Windows 95 computer game port.  I find that the software is installed, and launches with no problems.  I click the button to take a picture, and the @#%^@ computer reboots.  \n\nHmmm.  I must have kicked the power cord.  Let me try that again.  Wait 10 minutes for the reboot, and launch software.  Click button to take picture, and the @#%^@ computer reboots again.  Intrigued, I decide to dig deeper.  Try again, and another reboot.  \n\nTime to uninstall and reinstall.  Navigate to Control Panel, find $well_thought_out_tech software and uninstall.  Dialog box pops up *que pasa?*.  What the hell?  How did he install the Spanish driver for a webcam on an English install of Windows 95?  Uninstall software and reboot.  Install English drivers and test.  Multiple pictures taken and no reboot.  Time to explain technology.  \n\n&gt;$sbil:  Bad camera wasn't it?  I will go box it up and take it back.  \n&gt;$me:  It is working like a charm.  Daughter is up playing with it now, having a blast.  \n&gt;$nurse:  What was wrong?  \n&gt;$me:  $sbil not only does not *know computers*, he doesn't know what damn country he is in.  He installed the Spanish drivers.  Windows freaked out from a *literally* foreign command in the software and rebooted.  \n&gt;$sbil:  But I did it right!\n$me:  But I did it *more* right, and it works now.  See you on Monday, $nurse.  You owe me cookies!  \n\nAnd back to games I went. \n\n",

        "text": "**[Timeline](https://redd.it/6v3az8) of my other stories separated by company.**\n\n***\n\nIt’s a been a while since I posted something. I still have *plenty* of stories about $Senseless that I’ve been typing up for you guys, but this story happened earlier this week that I have to share. As some of you know, I work for a company that provides back office software (**$BOC**) for convenience stores, gas stations, and whoever else wants to buy it among a few other products. I am a part of our implementation team that conducts remote and onsite installation of our products, so I typically work based on appointments.\n\nOne of our products is a software that utilizes your scanner to scan invoices into our back office website so our data entry team can input them into our system for the customer so they don’t have to enter it themselves.\n\nI had an appointment earlier this week to install our scanner software with one of our customers. We’ll call him **$Derp**. I have $Derp let me remote into his store’s computer via $PopularRemoteTool and I start to set it up. I download and install our software onto their PC. While this is going on I open up Paint to see if their scanner is compatible with third party software. That “From scanner or camera” button is the way we check. If you didn’t know that, now you do.\n\nAnyway… I see that the option in Paint is greyed out, so I figure one of three things: 1) his scanner/MFP is turned off, 2) his scanner/MFP isn’t connected, or 3) his scanner/MFP is straight up not compatible. So, I start to probe for answers and the following conversation happened.\n\n&gt;**$Me**: Hmm, looks like your scanner isn’t compatible. What kind of scanner do you guys have there at the store?  \n&gt;**$Derp**: The one at my register? It’s a $POSScannerBrand.  \n&gt;**$Me**: No, I mean the one for your computer.  \n&gt;**$Derp**: I have a laptop. Is that a problem?  \n&gt;**$Me**: No, having a laptop isn’t a problem. But what kind of scanner do you use for it?  \n&gt;**$Derp**: Huh…? What’s a scanner? …Is that like an app?\n\nAt this point I am stunned and shocked. This guy sounded like he was in his 20s or early 30s, so surely he must know what a scanner is right? So, I say the only logical thing.\n\n&gt;**$Me**: No, it’s not an app. It’s a physical device. Depending on the manufacturer it could be roughly the same size as a printer, smaller than a printer, or built onto a printer. It’s used to basically make a digital copy of pictures, paperwork, basically anything to store on your computer or other storage media.  \n&gt;**$Derp**: Oh… Well, my boss says your software can do it!  \n&gt;**$Me internally**: What!?  \n&gt;**$Me**: Uh… No, our software is just that. It’s a program that requires a physical device. Similar to how if you want to play Call of Duty or Halo you need an Xbox or PlayStation.  \n&gt;**$Derp**: Oh… Okay… Well… Where would I buy one?  \n&gt;**$Me internally**: What?! Did he just…?  \n&gt;**$Me**: *face palm* Well, you could go to $MalWart, $WorstBuy, $RainForest, or a local computer shop.  \n&gt;**$Derp**: Cool. Uh, bye *hangs up*\n\nI am still completely dumbfounded. I mean… like for real? We have an app and I was tempted to point him to that, but our app is so buggy and we don’t have a dedicated developer working on it. So that’s out. I basically stared at my phone for a good five minutes with this huge confused expression on my face until my coworker asked me what was wrong, to which I explained the above.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: User checked out. Clean up on aisle 3.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot a word or two.",

        "text": "One of our clients asked us to segregate their application servers on our network to maintain security compliance. We kicked and screamed, but ultimately, we like their business and want to keep selling them our services. There's no hardware outlay for this work, it's all done virtually in the software.  \n  \nSo we reIP the test environment, and the client complains that intermittently, their users are unable to get to the server. Some troubleshooting reveals that they are sometimes unable to resolve the hostname of the test VIP.  \n  \nYou may recall, that the VIP is on the Internet side of the load balancer, and it connects to a pool of web and application servers on the inside. External VIP hostnames are resolved on the external DNS server.  Our change only impacted internal IPs. We didn't change the VIP.  \n  \nWell...I DID make a change to the external DNS zone files the week after Thanksgiving. But the client has been having intermittent connectivity issues since April. Which corresponds to the LAST time somebody updated the external DNS.  \n  \nSo we start digging. We get one of their network engineers to check name resolution from inside their network. And discover something fishy. When they are unable to resolve the VIP, their name server reports that our domain SOA (Start of Authority) is from a name server we don't have. Also, the serial number on the record indicates that it's from 2004. When they try to resolve the name of the test server VIP, they ask a name server that doesn't exist. As a result, the name resolution fails and their proxy pukes on itself.  \n  \nWe have 3 external DNS servers. Call them ns4, ns5, and ns6. Two are in the production data center, one is in DR. The SOA record calls out ns**2** as an authoritative source for our domain. Which it was. Back in 2004. So we take a look at the zone file. There are NS records for the domain for ns4, ns5, and ns6. We search for ns2...and find an A(ddress) record for it with an IP address owned by an old hosting provider. We discover a large number of A records in the external zone pointing to the old provider's subnet. A disturbing amount.  \n  \nApparently, these zone files had NEVER been cleaned up after the move from that hosting provider back in 2008. Instead of removing references to old nameserver IP addresses, they removed the NS records and left the old A records in place.  \n  \nThere are a number of clients complaining about poor performance...and we've been unable to find it. This particular client was more willing to work with us on troubleshooting because they need us to make this work for their compliance requirements.  \n  \nWe didn't remove the records for ns2 and ns3...we just pointed them at the addresses for ns5 and ns6. So far today, the client has seen no issues with the test environment. Time will tell if their other performance issues will be resolved by this same fix.  \n  \nTL;DR - Clean up your damned DNS zone files!",

No problems at all?  \n\n&gt;$SOL:  Only when I changed the ink.  I had trouble catching the little thing that moves so I could change the ink.  \n\n&gt;$me:  Ok, you had no trouble before....wait.  What did you say about \"catching\" something!!??  \n\n&gt;$SOL:  You know how that one thing moves to the right, and then back to the left when you turn on the printer?  \n\n&gt;$me:  &lt;internally masking thoughts&gt; Yes?  \n\n&gt;$SOL: I almost never caught it.  I had to turn it off and on about 6 times to catch it.  Then, I had to hold it while I changed the cartridges.

        "text": "The following tale takes place at my previous place of employment. I was working at a smallish research center (~40 staff) in the Midwest as one of their scientists. We lost our sys admin/desktop support/all-in-one IT guy and I was volunteered/offered to fill in until we found a new one. [Here's a different tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/439uwh/never_mind_we_figured_it_out/) from that time. Let's just say it was a bumpy 8 months.\n\nWe were stationed at a large university, but had our own separate servers for most things. That meant we used Lotus Domino/Notes while the rest of the campus had Exchange or had migrated to Office365. \n\nHere is just one of the nightmares during that time:\n\n**Spam Filter Fiasco** - We had [third party spam filtering software](http://www1.maysoft.com/SpamSentinel_for_Domino) that did a pretty good job for the most part. One day our director emailed me and asked if I could check the spam filter for an email he was expecting from a university official. They were in the same room when it was sent, but nothing came through.\n\n  I checked the quarantine, and to my horror, there were hundreds of emails from various university personnel that were flagged as spam. Apparently our university's domain get blacklisted by our spam filter and nothing got through for about three weeks. We were in the midst of a huge multi-million dollar project and apparently the lack of progress that month was due to emails not getting through, who'd a thunk it? Most of our staff hated working with university folks, so maybe that's why no one told me they weren't getting emails from them? Who knows.\n\n  After a few hours on the phone with the spam filter company, the best solution we could come up with was to just use a pattern matching rule to allow them through.\n\n  This solution caused a catastrophic failure of our Lotus Domino server. A little background: about 80% of the spam we received came from spoofed addresses using our domain. We were a sub-domain of the university. Our domain was XXX.YYY.edu. Our newly implemented rule white listed any messages coming from addresses containing YYY.edu. Within a few minutes our server got hit with thousands of messages and couldn't keep up. It crashed hard.\n\n  All of this occurred while on the phone with the spam company, so we rolled that white list rule back and finally ghetto-rigged a whitelist rule that allowed our university domain, but not our own spoofed domain.\n\nI'd say like to say that that was the worst problem with our Lotus setup, but that was only the start. Within a week of the new IT guy starting, he discovered our server was setup as an open relay. It had tremendous amounts of third party traffic on it. Now we understood why the server would crash on a weekly basis.\n\nI'll save our ID file debacle for another time...\n\n**TL;DR: Lotus Notes, not even once**",

        "text": "*[Behold!  I went and made a chronological ordering of these!](https://redd.it/7i0esb)*\n\n***\n\nOne of the downsides to the civilian aviation industry at a Large $AviationCompany is seniority.  Being towards the bottom of the totem pole meant I was on third shift, working from 2100 to 0700, on a rotating on/off schedule that was almost impossible to follow.  Average seniority to *get* day shift in my department—Intermediate Maintenance (IMX)--was a 1984 start-date…and I had started in 2010.  \n\nNaturally, when an opportunity to work Day Shift, 8 hours a day, Monday-Friday for three months arose, I jumped at it.  None of the high-seniority guys wanted it, so a small group of us low-seniority mechanics found ourselves with a rather sweet gig doing what were called “Reliability Visits.”  (A Reliability Visit is basically a routine visit where we take care of or modify systems with reliability issues.)  And for three months, it was an excellent time of learning, hanging out and actually having a normal life for the first time in years.  Only downside was when someone stole my VivoTab from my bag in the locker room, but $AviationCompany kindly replaced it with a brand new Surface after I’d reported it stolen.\n\nIn the last month of the project, a trio of positions were announced in the Continuous Improvement Group for two Maintenance Planners and one Improvement Guru.  We would remain part of our department, just seconded to this special group for an indefinite duration of time and could, at any time, return to the floor.  It would be a day shift assignment, 10 hour days, 4 days a week…which sounded absolutely wonderful.   I decided to go ahead and apply for the Improvement side—I’d just finished my business degree the year prior—and was selected for an interview.  On the day of said interview, my interviewer (a lead from my department who had disappeared into this group a year prior) asked me which position I was applying for, and if I was interested in the planning roles once I’d told him I was looking for the Continuous Improvement guru—which I said I was, on a lark.\n\nAbout a week later, I receive a call—my old lead informed me he’d selected me for a planner position, effective almost immediately.  Over the next week I was issued my ~~leash~~ company phone, wifi hotspot and laptop and began working upstairs.  I found out I’d be working with a High Profile Customer ($HPC) on our Maintenance Repair Organization (MRO) side of the operation planning the checks for their aircraft.  It was pretty exciting, all in all, as I would be wearing normal street clothes, would be working daytime hours, still had three-day weekends, and could actually work from home if necessary.  And if I ever got sick of it, I could head back to the floor and resume holding a wrench, which I likely would after a year or two of holding down a desk.  In the meantime, I would enjoy being a part of my organization’s leadership team.\n\nWithin a few days of my moving upstairs, I was also notified that I’d been chosen for Employee of the Quarter on the behalf of the entirety of Base and Intermediate Maintenance (IMX) and was sent to The Mothership for an award, pictures, and lunch.  My name would be engraved on a little marker and attached to the giant plaque in the hallways outside our hangars, and I was told to take my wife out for dinner and submit the receipt.  (We ended up going to a *very* nice and none-too-cheap steak house…)\n***\n\nThe email came suddenly and very unexpectedly in the late afternoon during my third week upstairs.  Our facility director was notified only a few hours before, but the rest of us in the leadership team were completely taken by surprise.  The announcement was simple and straightforward:\n\n&gt;EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY: Intermediate Maintenance will now fall under the umbrella of Line Maintenance and become separate from Base Maintenance.\n\nThere were three of us upstairs from IMX (the lead, myself, and one other guy) and our first question the very next day was our own fate in this sudden ‘schism’ we were caught up in.  Our boss offered us a choice: We could immediately return to IMX, the floor, and our normal schedules….Or we could continue working in the Continuous Improvement group as planners and the lead.  I thought hard, saw that bridge burning away, and decided not to cross back home.  The three of us were formally Exiled from IMX and shuffled over to Base Maintenance (BMX) Administration.\n\nSince my Employee of the Quarter award was for IMX and came so close to the Schism, the plaque was never updated for that quarter and as far as most leadership is concerned never happened.\n***\n\nI settled into my new role quickly, and was introduced to a new [Very Special Mod]( https://redd.it/77fdb6).  Yes, you see that correctly.  The VSW I (very poorly explained) have found myself coming back to every so often for the past two years.  This was, however, my very first introduction to it.  \n\nWhen an aircraft receives a standard modification, it is performed using a ‘Service Bulletin.’  (SB)  The SB is basically the description of the modification, the instructions to perform it, and any testing and other pertinent information required by maintenance.  My lead passed me the four service bulletins required by this modification and told me to study up on it and get with the Head Inspector about any changes he sees that need to be made to the paperwork—this mod was not yet FAA approved for this aircraft type, so it was still in the engineering phase and we could request changes to the paperwork easily.  \n\nI read through them the first time and died a little inside.  The instructions were almost literally “Install Modification Piece per drawings” for each step.\n\nIt was obviously unacceptable.  I got with the Head Inspector and we re-wrote the engineer’s instructions to be clear and step-by-step complete with signature blocks for mechanic and inspection accountability, emailed them to him and got him to change them entirely.  And then we did the same for the testing instructions.  It took a couple of weeks, but when $HPC showed up with their first plane, we were ready to go...\n\n…at least, we thought we were.\n\n***\n\nIt was a minor detail, really, as far as the engineer was concerned.  In fact, he didn’t see why we were having any issues with the drawings at all.  $HPC’s Aircraft, a Model-X, used the same exact fuselage tube as a Model-Y.  The mod had been done successfully on the Model-Y aircraft, and since the difference is mostly that a Model-Y has two more engines than a Model-X, it shouldn’t be a big deal to copy/paste the same exact installation templates.  Obviously we were doing something wrong if the frames and aircraft structure weren’t lining up with the drawings.  \n\nThankfully, the engineering firm had sent the engineer out for on-site support for this first-of-type install and we were able to drag him onto the plane to look at things.  Of course, while boarding the aircraft he didn’t pay any attention to where he was stepping and put his foot through an open floor panel and the ductwork below, wrecking the duct.  After making sure he was fine, we lead him to the installation site for the majority of the modification equipment, where he very swiftly learned that while yes, the fuselage tubes are the same in measurement, they aren’t the same in internal structure.  \n\nWhile he was being led back out of the plane, one of the techs installing the wiring runs and auxiliary mod equipment pulled him aside to ask an important question.\n\n&gt;**Installer** Hey, you’ve got the wires running down the overhead ceiling area on the right side of the aircraft.  We can’t put it there.  Can we move all of this to the left side of the aircraft?”  \n\nThe installer pointed up, and it was immediately apparent to all but the engineer what the issue was.\n\n&gt;**Engineer**  Can’t you just move that duct over to the other side and get it out of the way?  We never had this issue on the Model-Y.\n\nFrankly, I’m surprised the engineer didn’t just burst into flames right there from the looks he was getting.  Allow me to explain—Down the right side of centerline ran the air conditioning ductwork for the interior of the plane as well as all the supporting structure.  The left side had the majority of the wiring runs because there was no equipment installed on that side and in the way.  On the Model-Y aircraft, this is actually reversed—yet another instance of copy/paste instead of actually looking at the aircraft they were modding.  \n\nUsing small words, we explained the issue with modifying the system to appease him and eventually, he understood.  We escorted him back to his hole and eventually gave us new drawings to fix his mess. \n\nLater on, at the very end of the visit Engineer was left unsupervised in the aircraft while the testing crew was up front.  Deciding he was getting hot, he took it upon himself to open an aircraft door.  Thankfully the slide was disarmed, however it was a very windy day…and was caught by the wind immediately and ripped fully open, leaving the now wrecked shroud he’d attempted to grab in his hand.  He made up a story, was caught in the lie and was asked to leave and never ever set foot in our facility again.  \n\n***\nDuring the visit, I was called by the lead running the $HPC aircraft visit who was looking for a specific drawing for the mod.  I did a bit of research and soon discovered exactly what drawing he’d asked for…\n\nIt was for this mod, specific to Type DCCLXVII aircraft, produced by the competitor of the manufacturer of the Model X and Y aircraft.  Once again, his copy/paste habit had struck.  I would eventually learn it was part of the Engineering Firm’s culture—they burned through engineers so quickly that there was no one expert on the mod they were issuing, so I’ve been finding copypasta from competing aircraft manufacturer versions of the mod for the past two years. \n\nTL;DR: The grass isn’t greener on the other side, just better lit.\n",

        "text": "First off, a little background info: I work in the help desk of an reinsurance company. It's usually a pretty chill job since we are like 5 supporters for around 350 users.\n\nBut! This lady from HR is an absolute dragon, by far the worst user I've ever seen (and I've been in support for a few years). She somehow manages to have some \"Outlook error\" every single day and you can be sure that she reports every single issue to us, even if it's something where the error message says it should suffice to restart Outlook. And she gets angrier every time. We have tried everything to have her not call anymore: rebuild the ost file, reset her profile, gave her a new laptop (with windows 10 when we haven't started migrating yet), she still has problems every single day. And it's not a network issue, we made sure of this as well!\n\nWell now, she opened up a ticket stating that she can't even send mails with attachments anymore. The error message was in Word and it was something along the lines of \"All send using email options are currently disabled because you have an email window open\". Now I was sure this was her fault, but at first, I wasn't able to reproduce this error. But my co-worker showed me how Adobe Acrobat DC blocks itself and Outlook after you hit \"send file as attachment\", and both programs can't be used until you send / close the mail. This also makes it impossible to send attachments from word while this draft with the pdf attachment is still open. Learning this made me very happy because I now have PROOF THAT IT'S HER FAULT! \n\nI wish I could rub it in her face somehow, like telling her over and over again \"it IS your fault\", the same way Robin William's character told Will Hunting \"it's not your fault\". IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT BARBARA!!! WHY DO YOU HAVE OVER 30 DRAFTS OPEN AT ALL TIMES!\n\n...At least I had sent her a link to a forum thread were someone passive-aggressively questioned the used way of sending attachments. I mean really, why don't you just use drag-and-drop or the paper clip icon??\n\n",
