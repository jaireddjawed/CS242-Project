It might still work but helium fusion produces only 9% the energy of hydrogen fusion. But helium also goes through fusion faster.

In our sun there might not be any fusion, but, carbon should fuse in a larger star. But would the fusion of carbon be enough to counter gravity without the outer fusion layers of hydrogen and helium to add onto the outward pressure?",

For example, if we called just positrons promatter and electrons antimatter:\n\n**Promatter** | **Antimatter**\n-|-\nUp | Antiup\nDown | Antidown\nPositron | Electron\nElectron neutrino | Positron neutrino\netc. |\n\nI know that all the quarks have baryon number either +1/3 or -1/3, thus if the up quark is called promatter, then it is desirable that the down, strange, charm, top, and bottom should all be promatter as well because they all have the same baryon number, and then their antiparticles would be called antimatter. Or vice-versa.\n\nLikewise, all leptons have lepton number +1 or -1, so the electron, muon, and tau particles and their respective neutrinos should all be grouped together, and their antiparticles grouped separately. So my last example above would actually be a bad classification, because it does not group leptons with the same lepton number together.\n\nBut is there any physical or mathematical reason that we group the quarks and leptons the way we do? If we decided that the electron and all it's relatives were antimatter and the positron and all it's relatives were matter, while leaving the quarks as they are, is there any reason this system would be undesirable?\n\n**Promatter** | **Antimatter**\n-|-\nUp | Antiup\nDown | Antidown\nPositron | Electron\nPositron neutrino | Electron neutrino\netc. |\n\nOr\n\n**Promatter** | **Antimatter**\n-|-\nAntiup | Up\nAntidown | Down\nElectron | Positron\nElectron neutrino | Positron neutrino\netc. |",

Perhaps, during within this time frame the images can be obtained to observe what actually happens from the perspective of people who are passing on. I have a theory that a smaller sample size of subjects will show nothing on the recording device (i.e. pitch black) but a larger sample size could render a few outliers that are deviating or a few standard deviations from the mean could actually tell us that there is some activity in the particular recording from a patient. \n\n‚ÄúMany of life‚Äôs failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up‚Äù - Thomas Edison\n\nMaybe there will be something interesting in that one recording.

Thousands of years ago we thought the Earth was flat and someone who said it might be different was attacked by people who thought to know better.\n\nIf the universe however is curved on a very large scale we would not be able to measure it until our measurements are getting better.

On paper these should appeal to any  organization that routinely handles and distributes a lot of data.

Is there any reason why these  projects would or would not be appealing to them? I presume that these  institutions are already used to handling their data storage and  distribution 'in-house', and for them to be interested in  blockchain  services they would need to be cheaper than whatever the in-house cost  is.

However, of all the arguments he has presented to the table, the one about a human's irreducable complexity is the hardest one to contend with, and I was wondering if you could help.\n\nHere's the argument that the man makes:\n\n\"The human brain is very complex, and as far as we know, nothing could've made itself into something intelligent, even if it was given billions of years. Life cannot create an intelligent human brain from non-life because of how it is so complex and how it is more competent than so many other creatures and species. Furthermore, even with our current technology, we cannot artificially replicate a human brain, let alone transfer one's consciousness from the physical mind, digitally. Scientists estimate that it will be a while before we are able to make an artifical human brain as complex and as intelligent as ours. So somehow, humans cannot create a brain that can imitate their mind, yet nature created something us modern humans couldn't produce?! How could nature just create a very intelligent human brain while humans find it so difficult to replicate? It's simple, humans couldn't have evolved because nature is too incompetent to do so... an intelligent designer had to have designed us human beings. Thus, because of the complexity of the human mind and how scientists can't simply remake a copy of the human brain, we had to have been designed by a higher power.\"\n\nThat's basically the most of what he said, and I have a feeling it's still an assertion, but I don't know how to refute that argument.

The idea is that global warming is caused by excess CO2 in the atmosphere contributed by humans. Interestingly, other pollution caused by humans - smog (or particulates) actually reduces global warming by obscuring the sun. We have passed many laws that have successfully reduced smog - which has actually made global warming worse.   \n\n\nThey estimate that if we were to cease ALL human-made CO2 emissions today, it would tak 145 years for the world to recover. They have a suggestion to speed this up: introduce particulates into the atmosphere, worldwide. Either by fitting ships to spray water into the air (adding salt into the air) or by even building a giant pipe and sending up huge quantities of particulates to obscure the sun.   \n\n\nDoes this strike anyone as comically dangerous? I see a new ice age coming on if we try to set our weather at a planetary scale. Impatience in this area seems to be extremely dangerous. If it takes 100+ years to fix things, why not wait? As long as we know we‚Äôre heading in the right direction, do we really want to tempt fate?\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/emission-cuts-will-fail-what-to-do-then-fusion-nuclear-energy-geoengineering-solar-radiation-air-capture-myhrvold-climate-63f65873](https://www.wsj.com/articles/emission-cuts-will-fail-what-to-do-then-fusion-nuclear-energy-geoengineering-solar-radiation-air-capture-myhrvold-climate-63f65873)",

The physical conditions on the planet (atmosphere, gravity, climate) are unchanged. At any time in the past, have there been any potential roadblocks or tightly passed bottlenecks for our technological advancement?\n\n1. Availability of a certain natural resources that allowed for further development. At what point could our technological development halt if not for a certain resource? What alternative, less efficient paths could we have taken? \n\n2. Have there been unexpected or sudden scientific discoveries or inventions that, in hindsight, seem well before their time? In the same vein, are there any technologies that now seem \"objectively late\", as in \"why haven't we done this sooner, all conditions were there all along?\". \n\n3. This one is the most vague, sorry. Suppose humanity disappears today, poof, everybody gone. \n\nOn the timescale until the planet becomes uninhabitable due to the sun's expansion, is there a possibility of another intelligence in our wake to develop a civilization sophisticated enough to leave the Earth in time?\n\nWill the ravens or octopi have enough time to evolve complex tool use, language and everything else necessary? Let's assume their evolution moves towards that. \n\nWill they have enough resources left? Will anything remain from us to kickstart their tech on those timescales? \n\n\nI appreciate any insight you can offer, and sorry if my questions are too loosely connected or too unscientific to ask.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/114rgc8/how_can_i_compare_my_grip_strength_to_a_redtailed/",
        "text": "I recently got a hand dynamometer for grip strength evaluation and I'd love to be able to compare my strength--which the dynamometer gives in pure kilograms--with a red-tailed hawk's--which is given in kg/cm2 (or psi). But I'm unsure of how to convert either of these into the units of the other.\n\nHere's one idea I have. To convert my dynamometer reading into a kg/cm2 reading, I can measure the area that my fingers come into contact with on the \"bar\" portion of the hand dynamometer. Then I can simply divide my kg reading by that area. But then I'd be unsure whether to count the non-bar portion of the dynamometer that my *palm* comes into contact with (I'd guess not, because the dynamometer just gauges the downward force on the bar portion -- the palm contact just stabilizes the pulling process).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas? Thank you!!",

I've often wondered why people who get radiation sickness get incredibly sick, seem to get better, and then get worse again? What is happening to people when this is all going on? Is what they depict happening to people on that series accurate or just embellishment to make things more dramatic?\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to read this.",

It's now been 15 years, and I never heard about this again. It looks like he began working on the problem in the 80s, but around when this article came out is when the FDA had approved human trials.\n\nSo, where has the research gone in the last 15 years? What happened to keep this from already going mainstream? Was it never as good as he claimed, were their terrible side effects, or was it something else? I found Dr. Hillman's university page (https://dental.ufl.edu/profile/hillman-jeffrey/) with links to several more recent papers, but the abstracts are pretty dense to me, and I'm not sure if/how they relate to the previous research.",

        "text": "Hi (sorry for any english mistake or quirk you may find in the following message, I'm no native speaker)\n\nPlease, do not hesitate to tell me if this message is gibberish, I'll try my best to reformulate.\n\nMy question may be a \"silly\" question, but I can't help wondering about it : is osmotic pressure strictly speaking a \"force\" ?\n\nIn   other words, in the classic expermient of a U-shaped tube with a   semipermeable membrane in the middle separating a pure solvent (e.g.   water) from a solution of a solute in the same solvent, is the resultent   level difference between both parts of the tube caused by an actual   force (comparable to hydrostatic force) exerted from the \"pure solvent   part\" (hereafter part A) of the tube on the \"solution part\" (hereafter   part B) of the tube ?\n\nYou may wonder why I'm asking this silly question. Well it's because I've seen this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OOvMiKCp8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OOvMiKCp8A),   which seem to imply that the reason for the level difference between A   and B is only that solvent molecules from both part of the tube move  on  average in the same way and, equivalently, have the same forces  applying  on them (I really hope this sentence is clear), but because  many of the  solvent molecules from the solution part are linked to the  solute  particles and therefore cannot pass trough the semipermeable  membrane,  there is, on average, less solvent molecule going from B to A  thant from  A to B. So the reason for the level difference is, so to  speak,  statistical, rather than straightforwardly mechanical (this last   sentence is clearly not rigourous, at least more clearly than the rest   of my message, but I think you get what I'm trying to say).\n\nLooking forward to reading you !",
