        "text": "Original post was removed - reposting with anecdotal and subjective advice only, please consult with your primary care physician or psychiatrist for more info \n\nHi, just wanted to hop on here and share some tips and advice with y’all. As the title says, I’m a doc with ADHD myself and the shortage has finally hit me, going on ~2 weeks without my meds for the first time in many years! We all know how tough it is to get through the day without our meds so you can imagine the fear and anxiety I have about caring for people’s lives in this shortage. Unfortunately, nothing will replace stimulants and you probably know that already. However, there are some things that can help. Typically, these tips are hit or miss, the irony being that having ADHD makes a lot of these things nearly impossible to do. But the current shortage can provide some motivation to adopt some new habits. Here’s what I’ve been telling myself and my patients: \n\n1. Sleep is one of the most important contributors to ADHD symptoms; not getting enough means even when you take your medication, it won’t work as well. Start taking 1-3 mg of melatonin nightly (if you don’t already) about 2 hrs before your bedtime. Do whatever you can to get AT LEAST 6-8 hrs of sleep every night consistently. \n\n2. Exercise is a natural stimulant. It releases dopamine much in the same way as medications and has a lot of other benefits too! If you’re able to, spend a few minutes in the morning getting your heart rate up in some type of activity, even better if it’s something that makes you happy doing, like yoga or dance or jogging outside.\n\n3. Mindfulness and meditation essentially teach your brain how to focus. Meditation can also reduce stress and anxiety, two big contributors to ADHD symptoms. I personally really like the app Balance and I’ve heard that Headspace is great as well. I’d suggest downloading a bunch and seeing which ones work for you! Buying yourself a cute and comfy new meditation cushion helps too :) \n\n3. Natural supplements - omega-3 fish oil, I suggest about 500-1000 mg daily; make sure you check labels for mercury-free versions! Unfortunately, the research on other vitamins and minerals like magnesium, iron, B6, and zinc are too inconclusive to recommend. However, a daily multivitamin likely won’t hurt! \n\n4. If you’ve been struggling to get meds refilled for months with no end in sight and are open to different medications, there are some non-stimulant options that may work for some people and probably aren’t in a current shortage although I have heard of some places being out of Strattera recently. Some people see benefits with Wellbutrin and Qelbree is a new one that some have liked as well, but it’s up to you and your doctor to pick the right one for you. \n\nAnd lastly, a few things to know if you’re going to call pharmacies and try to send your prescription around - be sure that you have a doctor that responds quickly as pharmacies may have them in stock that day but not the next. Also, be careful with this as most states have a prescription tracking system that lets providers know when you last filled your meds, where, and by whom, and unfortunately, it flags you if you go above a certain number of pharmacies and prescribers within the calendar year. Ridiculous given what’s going on with the current shortage and hopefully your doctor will be understanding but not everyone is. \n\nAgain, I know that these changes won’t be easy but they will work if you’re able to implement them and can even enhance the effects of your medication when you do finally get that refill! Here with and for you all ❤️ Hopefully we won’t have to deal with this much longer!",

You may be thinking, “how tf do you do that?” Well, I did.. \n\nI went to take another medication because I had stayed up late gaming, and never took it. I take the med to improve my skin, and have nearly 0 side effects, so taking it at 2am isn’t a big deal. \n\nI pick up the bottle, open it, and as I swallow I hear the tiniest maraca.. (that’s how I think the little adderall beads sound), and then I panicked. I wasn’t super awake, I was watching a video, and my adderall used to be in a different bottle because I got it at a different pharmacy, and my other med was also in a different bottle.. well they essentially flipped bottle shapes. Obviously I know that, but I just accidentally took it..\n\nAnyway, it’s been a horrible night. I usually am not too terribly affected by stimulants, like I have taken naps after taking my adderall, but I haven’t truly slept. I am so wide awake, it has been torture.",

        "text": "rule disclaimer: I've read them. I am not asking for a diagnosis nor a treatment, but rather how to measure my reaction to a very first treatment, in my daily life.\n\nHey guys. My age is 31 yo. I have been questioning about ADHD for a couple of years, and my psychologist finally recommended me to a psychiatrist for an assessment. After the first session, this psychiatrist is not sure if my attention is dysfunctional enough to be called a disorder. But he has agreed there are indeed behaviours that might impair me, as in, an attention lower than average. He based this argument on the fact that no one is 100% neurotypical, and that some traits related to disorders occur naturally, but in a manner that's usually manageable. Anyway, as a result, he went and prescribed me a daily dose of Methyl phenydate: Concerta 18 milligram. This was 2 weeks ago.\n\nAccording to him, I would just try it, and see the change, and decide if it is helping me out or not. I feel a bit iffy about this, especially since there are horror stories about the molecule becoming addictive to neurotypical persons. But that's not my question here.\n\nMy question, how am I to measure the benefits of this medication on my own and then report to the psychiatrist? I cannot be sure there's no placebo effect at work. What I have done, in these last 2 weeks of \"trying\", I skipped a dose every other day, to be able to compare 2 days side-by-side, one with, one without.\n\nIt seems to show higher attention when I speak to someone, especially in the foreign language I'm trying to learn (I am expat), I have less the fear of \"forgetting what I was about to think of\", and I feel a bit more focused on the thing I decide to do on the moment. But on the other hand, it doesn't seem to correct some distraction in the workplace, that I believed to be related to a possible ADHD.\n\nI am looking for support and advice from other persons who tiptoed themselves, at an older age, in their process of the very first assessement of ADHD, and had to observe their own reaction to a treatment.\n\nThanks,",

        "text": "I figured I wanted to make a thread where those of us frustrated with current shortages have managed to coordinate a fill (even if it ended up being a different medicine to hold you over) what hoops have you jumped through this month?\n\nToday my goal was to get my 20mg adderal instant release filled. From the past 4 months, I know now to call the pharmacy i intend on picking up from, before the prescription is even valid or able to be filled. I do this because for several months my anxiety has spiked on days where I need to get my medicines filled. It is more intense and more of a headache than dealing with most drug dealers now.\n\nMonday (Mar. 13) : call pharmacy that I filled with last month (they filled 60 10s instead of 30 20s as it's all they had) they tell me it's going to be 10mg again as 20mg is on a long back order. They said I had to wait one more day (tried to get it 1 day early because of an impending snowstorm the day of pickup) they said nope which I can understand.  What they didn't mention was they didn't even have my script.\n\nTuesday (Mar. 14) Next day I wake up and head to the pharmacy in the snow as I'd rather risk driving in the snow than spend the entire day being dysfunctional or sleeping. I didn't call because I presumed they would have informed me yesterday when I had spoke to them if it wasn't in stock. This is a local pharmacy as well, not a chain.\n\nUpon hearing they were out i was shocked but I've become seasoned and well versed in handling this. Or so I thought.\n\nI do what I always do when any question arises, drove in person to my psychiatrists office and inform the girls at the desk that once again I could really use their help both finding a pharmacy that can fill 10mg or 20mg today. They say that a local CVS 10 mins away should have it in stock. I say ok, and ask what should my next step be. They said to wait 30 mins before heading there so the script will show up. It took 3 hours for the script to show up, it wasn't ready when I went to ask for it because the doc office is slow to send in new scripts. When i asked the tech once again failed to mention that even if they did receive the script that they didn't even have any.\n\n3 hours later, i have to call and see if the script xferfed yet to CVS. it has, so I ask if I can fill it, they then inform me it's on backorder.\n\nSo I again drive to my psychiatrist office as reaching them by phone is near impossible. They eventually find a target that can partial fill. I ask if I can go now, the girl says no I had to wait for yet another new script to be sent out (and old one cancelled) and doc approval. Took many hours and I eventually call the pharmacy to make sure this is actually going to happen. The doc sent the script to the wrong pharmacy so they didn't have the script to look at, but the pharmacist was nice enough to say she will hold the last 50 adderal 10s they had so long as she can see that the script gets sent in today. .\n\nHours go by and I get a call from the doc office girl saying he sent the script but it needs his approval, I said ok what do I do she says she will call me. Closing hours pass and I never got a call so I drove to the pharmacy who put the 10s aside and she did in fact have the script on file. I finally thought I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. She says she needs 20 mins to fill it, so I go shop. 20 mins later I go back and she says she couldn't technically hold it because my doctor had for some reason put Don't fill until tomorrow even though it's been more than 30 days. So now I have been trying to get any fill from 8am to 6pm and still nothing and now I have to get up and be at the pharmacy and probably annoy them right when they open to make sure they're not given to someone else. Anyone ever had it this bad?",

        "text": "for those of you who first got diagnosed with adhd how did you figure out that you also had bipolar? \n\nMy psychiatrist and doctor suspect i have bipolar ll, because of my extreme mood shifts and at one point i didn’t sleep for 5 days which pointed to a hypomanic episode. But i was also taking Wellbutrin and Vyvanse at the time (which apparently can trigger hypomania even if someone isn’t bipolar). I’m getting a second opinion because im not entirely convinced since bipolar-like symptoms are commonly caused by adhd. But i also know the opposite is true where bipolar can be overlooked and mistaken for symptoms related to adhd.\n\nHere are some examples of symptoms/tendencies of mine that i think could be suggestive of bipolar:\n\n1. Extreme moods- usually about 80% of the time i feel emotionless/flat just meh and have low energy/motivation. The remaining 20% will be either/both: \n\n-extreme highs where im giddy, more talkative, have more energy and i feel like my thoughts are racing \n\n-extreme lows where i can’t get out of bed and/or feel like im in despair, my life is unbearable and have meltdown(s)\n\n(I also tend to notice that there isn’t always a clear trigger/reason for my moods)\n\n2. Irritability/anger-sometimes I feel so irritable and angry at people and even when i know it’s disproportionate or there isn’t really any reason to be it’s hard to turn off. And sometimes it’s over things from the past too and I’ll feel so mad to the point where it feels like im going crazy. But then after a few days/week(s) of holding that grudge I’ll wake up one day and decide im completely over it \n\n3. Episodic patterns-even though my moods can change/shift in the same day, I notice usually over the course of days/weeks there’s a noticeably more prominent mood. (And it doesn’t seem to be influenced by my life circumstances) \n\nas an example scenario, for 3 consecutive days i might be giddy/energetic for the majority of the time but then after that for a certain period of time i just have low energy/mood and no matter what i do i can’t feel giddy, happy or energetic \n\n\nLet me know your thoughts/if any of those things i listed resonate with you!",

How long did it take for you to begin to notice it working &amp; what did that look like?  \n\nI’m 32 male on 40mg for the past 2 weeks  titrated up from 10mg to 20mg. \nThis is my first time taking ADHD meds after a recent diagnosis.\nSome days I get this amazing calm focused feeling - like I’m at the optometrist and they flick the lens over my eyes and everything becomes clear. The noise and thoughts in my head going a mile a minute slow down and I feel calm. It’s a very foreign feeling to me but one I’ve been trying to reach for a long time. Some days the meds don’t reach that level of effectiveness (and I realise this is probably just due to it having to build up in my system) but thought I would ask anyways for some perspective.\n\nThanks",

We usually visit each other every weekends and it has been awesome. Until 2 days ago- he suddenly did not contact me at all, and changed out of the blue. He did not reply and practically ghosted me. I already had a ticket to go there to spend a whole week with him as well as my birthday. I called him but he still did not answer. He knew about the ticket, he planned it. I casually asked \"You're gonna pick me up at the usual spot, right?\"\n\nHe answer \"No. I need a break. It was too fast for me, I skipped the dating phase and it's unhealthy for me I have to decide where we should go\". \n\nI am very confused. Normally when I have this situation with my ex, I would talk it through, and we find solutions, not just ghost me rightaway after 2 months of beautiful relationships (we were very happy and passionate). \n\nAnd so, I remembered one day at his house, he was very hyperactive on something, and suddenly he lost focus on talking to me. He suddenly mentioned \"Yeah, I have ADHD but it's totally treatable. I have the medicine, I drink it, and that's ok\". I didnt have a chance to ask more about this.\n\nAfter he \"dumped\" me, I got to learn about how person with ADHD has this cycle of love bombing and ghost people rightaway. I read many threads on Reddit as well about this. \n\nMy questions:\nI really care about him. How could I talk him out that I genuinely care about him as a person and I would willingly to walk through with him to find a solution? Do you think he would contact me again? Do you have this experience as a person with ADHD or non-ADHD? I am actually thinking he has found someone new that boost up his dopamine by now, but as he lives alone, broken home, his parents left him, I really think I want to be there for him. Please, any suggestions are welcome.",

I also have bad perfectionism, so I tend to fail most activities that I do. I'm disabled in many areas of functioning at this point, if not all, including activities as simple as cooking and shopping. Obviously it isn't just ADHD, but my attention issues worsen my other difficulties.\n\nMy question is, how is it that so many people seemingly have no issues and go undiagnosed, only to seek out diagnosed as adults? What prompts you to get the diagnosis if you are doing well? To be honest, if I had a job, friends, all that sorta stuff, I don't think I would ever pursue a diagnosis that gives me a stigmatized label, no matter how difficult it's making my life. \n\nThe reason is because when I was labeled as a child, I felt immense shame and was heavily bullied for being ADHD and being different, and spent much of my childhood verbally and physically mistreated for my hyperactive behaviors. I still feel ashamed of who I am to this day, and would get rid of the diagnosis if it meant I could pass as normal.\n\nI'm kind of a bit jealous of that to be honest, because I wish I could've been a little bit less of a textbook case. I'd rather miss a diagnosis if it meant I could feel a little less tormented, unsuccessful and alone. Diagnosis as a child did nothing for me, and once I grew up I feel like they sorta threw me for the wolves. And since I can't make my own income and seek out resources for myself, I'm pretty much trapped in a loop of subpar medical care.",

I'm now 26 and have a job I absolutely love however I'm starting to notice my symptoms of ADHD affecting my performance outside of what I used to be able to control through different strategies. My impulsivity and lack of motivation is at an all time high despite having a true passion and interest in my job. This has become an issue outside of work too, and I'm becoming very unproductive despite knowing how easy and beneficial it is to get up and keep moving. I started going back to the gym daily to keep physically fit thinking this will help with discipline and energy etc. however this hasn't done much at all. I think it's time to bite the bullet and begin medication, so I thought I'd come to this lovely community to see if it would be helpful and what I should be careful of.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11rnlpr/tips_from_a_doctor_with_adhd/",
        "text": "Hi, just wanted to hop on here and share some tips and advice with y’all. As the title says, I’m a doc with ADHD myself and the shortage has finally hit me, going on ~2 weeks without my meds for the first time in many years! We all know how tough it is to get through the day without our meds so you can imagine the fear and anxiety I have about caring for people’s lives in this shortage. Unfortunately, nothing will replace stimulants and you probably know that already. However, there are some things that can help. Typically, these tips are hit or miss, the irony being that having ADHD makes a lot of these things nearly impossible to do. But the current shortage can provide some motivation to adopt a couple habits that have been proven to work. Here’s what I’ve been telling myself and my patients: \n\n1. Sleep is one of the most important contributors to ADHD symptoms; not getting enough means even when you take your medication, it won’t work as well. My recommendation is to take sleep hygiene as seriously as ever during this time. Start taking 1-3 mg of melatonin nightly (if you don’t already) about 2 hrs before your bedtime. Do whatever you can to get AT LEAST 6-8 hrs of sleep every night consistently. \n\n2. Exercise is a natural stimulant. It releases dopamine much in the same way as medications and has a lot of other benefits too! If you’re able to, spend a few minutes in the morning getting your heart rate up in some type of activity, even better if it’s something that makes you happy doing, like yoga or dance or jogging outside.\n\n3. Natural supplements - the only one at this time that has some credible research  backing it’s claims is omega-3 fish oil. It has been shown to improve focus and a couple studies looking at kids with ADHD found that many of them have lower levels of omega-3 in their blood at baseline. I suggest about 500-1000 mg daily; make sure you check labels for mercury-free versions! Unfortunately, the research on other vitamins and minerals like magnesium, iron, B6, and zinc are too inconclusive to recommend. However, a daily multivitamin likely won’t hurt! \n\n4. If you’ve been struggling to get meds refilled for months with no end in sight and are open to different medications, there are some non-stimulant options that may work for some people and probably aren’t in a current shortage although I have heard of some places being out of Strattera recently. \n\nAnd lastly, a few things to know if you’re going to call pharmacies and try to send your prescription around - be sure that you have a doctor that responds quickly as pharmacies may have them in stock that day but not the next. Also, be careful with this as most states have a prescription tracking system that lets providers know when you last filled your meds, where, and by whom, and unfortunately, it flags you if you go above a certain number of pharmacies and prescribers within the calendar year. Ridiculous given what’s going on with the current shortage and hopefully your doctor will be understanding but not everyone is. \n\nAgain, I know that these changes won’t be easy but they will work if you’re able to implement them and can even enhance the effects of your medication when you do finally get that refill! Here with and for you all ❤️ Hopefully we won’t have to deal with this much longer!",

Basically I just want to sit somewhere and not move or do anything. \n\nMy sleep is also a bit worse with Strattera, I wake multiple times per night for a short period and then immediately fall asleep again. But my current exhaustion/ tiredness feels different than that from lack of sleep, so I'm pretty sure it is from the meds.  \n\nAnd I'm currently almost falling asleep at my PC and I haven't even done anything today, is that normal on strattera? When should I stop, or do I have to push through?\n\nSo how do I know if the dosage is too high or if it's just the wrong med for me?\n\nI also tried ritalin and vyvanse, vyvanse works quite well, but only alleviates around 50% of my symptoms and doesn't really have an effect on my executive dysfunction, motivation and energy (which are my biggest problems).",

The only other time this has happened was after I drank two ice coffees in a row (yeah dumb idea). \n\nOther that that my HR has not changed at all so I’m confused as to why this is suddenly high? I thought maybe it was due to my period (I’ve also had my period over the last 2 days) but I wasn’t sure whether that logic follows through or not. Didn’t notice it on my last period but I can’t think of any other reason. \n\nAnyone else experience this? / is this a massive concern at all (I’m super anxious about messing up my heart because I’m so young haha) \n\nIf I’m completely wrong are there any other reasons this could be happening because as per my understanding 20mg is a pretty small dose (but it’s effective for me so maybe it’s enough to damage as well?)",

Due to a heart condition, it was tough to actually find a medication that didn’t make me feel physically uncomfortable and was still effective in treating the ADHD. \n\nBut back on topic, once I really thought about the symptoms and how they’d affect relationships, I was a lot less harsh on myself. After taking the medication I settled on for a bit, thoughts about this person pretty much disappeared.\n\nUnfortunately I’m fairly certain that I’m starting to develop a resistance to the meds, as I’ve been starting to have a really tough time focusing on really anything recently, and the fixation feels like its coming back.

She confirms that I have ADHD inattentive type and major depressive disorder. \n\nWhen I see my psychiatrist, he tells me that he hasn't read the report, asks if the evaluation was \"done by a PhD,\" and proceeds to skim the letter during the visit. He then insists that my attentional issues are due to depression and refuses to believe the report??? Mind you, I have spoken with my psychiatrist twice before this, so he doesn't know me very well at all.

I was seeing about working part time at the moment but I’m worried that part time hours will be the only thing I can handle. When it comes to physical work, I get tired. If I sit at a desk too long, I get tired. Yet an office job would be something I’m up for, if just need to get up for a few moments. \n\nMy main concern is doing decently at my work. Because of chronic fatigue, the constant amount of energy I need to focus or to tasks, or anything that throws me off for the rest of the day, I worry that I’ll struggle with work. I don’t mind monotonous, repetitive work but if it’s a bad day, I’m bound to make mistakes. It doesn’t help that I also can’t retain large amounts of information. \n\nI’ve been on Wellbutrin for a couple of months now, I know it’s made a difference but I am unsure if I would need a higher dose or to go on a different medication to help me more. I just want to know how other people have found a way to get around similar problems? Thanks.",

I always struggled in school but was always a socialite during middle/highschool. But once I turned 17/18 my mental health plummeted, and ever since then it’s just been a living hell to deal with being bi polar and now finding out I have adhd and just looking back at how I was never diagnosed (my sister was at the age of 7, I never got checked because my mom said I never showed any signs )My gpa in highschool was barely even a 1.0 and it didn’t change until I was put in an alternative program. Sadly I never graduated, but anyways. I was hoping to get some advice on how you guys have managed to cope with your guys adhd and bi polar if you also are. Lifes been so difficult and I just wanna be able to be who I wanna be without constant hell. Thanks for takin the time to read and maybe helpin :)",

        "text": "While the discussion about bad memory on this sub has referred to inability to recall, ADHD has an emotional component that leaves unpleasant memories burned into our brains for years to come.\n\npwADHD have at least 4 of 5 criteria needed to qualify as ODD. It's not the forgetfulness or inattentiveness that leads to the firings and divorces nearly as much as the impulsive emoting. Others naturally self-sooth where we have to make a much more deliberate effort. Others restrain themselves so as not to step on toes while we suffer from foot-in-mouth disease. Over and over throughout the day, memories of embarrassing interactions from years ago distract me. I can recognize them now as being ADHD/ODD-related, which helps me compartmentalize them and fear recurrences less, but I do envy those who didn't have a disability to leave them with so much to move on from.\n\nI now better understand the line from *Citizen Kane,* that memory is one of the great curses to beset Man. Unfortunately the bad memory of ADHD doesn't cancel out the bad memories caused by ADHD.\n\n*The flair is misleading. This post is more of an observation, and sharing of an irony. No flair for that.",

I wanted to ask him about raising the dosage if possible. Truthfully I use more on the weekends than I do weekdays since I have more available time to get my life sorted. How do I go about asking him to raise dosage? Do I just tell him I feel it is not as effective as it used to be? Do I mention I feel side effects but no benefits? Do I tell him the effect isnt as strong as I want so I redose earlier than usual? Do I tell him I will take 3 or 4 on a weekend if I have a lot to get done and just skip days later in the week? Just wondering how everyone else’s conversations went with their doctors.\n\nOn a similar topic: is it possible to ask your doctor to prescribe specific brands of adderall? This shortage has made me realize one of the manufacturers I have been regularly getting gives me CRAZY side effects compared to the others I had in the past few months (lannett vs teva/sandoz). Is there even a brand name for adderall IR? I looked up that teva owns adderall but is still considered generic? Main question being: can I ask my doctor to prescribe specific brands? Or is it on me to call the pharmacy and find out what they are currently carrying and call my doctor accordingly?\n\nAny tips or anecdotes would be appreciated. Thank you",

I have a very hectic schedule and my psychiatrist thinks I’m only using the medication to stay away . Not true it helps me with brain fog , confidence , staying on top of things . Enrolled in a CDL course and have been doing good so far . Finished 7 classes to get my hsed diploma only have 4 more to go yay . It’s helped me all around . I gues my question is is it possible that he just doesn’t want to prescribe it due to having to call it in every month or to fill out more paperwork or does 4x a day push the limit ?",
