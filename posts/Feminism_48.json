I’ve only worked  like six shifts and I’ve been groped or someone has tried to force themselves to kiss me everyday. \n\nThe people groping me are clients of the lounge. Left to my own devices, I would probably punch them or yell at them but I also feel compelled to be as cordial as possible because I don’t want to lose my job or cause a scene at work.  So, there’s a weird power dynamic. \n\nSo far, two managers have witnessed  it happen. They seem sympathetic.  But, one has said “you need to smack their hands” and the other has said “you can’t just let people feel on you”.  These feel like hurtful  responses to me, almost as if I’m being reprimanded somehow.  Last night, a guy asked me out on a date, I refused, and he tried to force me to kiss him. So, they sent me home an hour early because I guess I was visibly upset. I just don’t understand how that was an appropriate solution.\n\nAm I blowing this out of proportion or is this just wrong and what do I do about this? It’s just exhausting. I want to quit but I need to money. \n\n",

I have read more widely since then, and I am supportive and love my gorgeous women friends who are trans. However, I am not active in feminist activist spaces anymore except a few rallies. \n\nI was confused by some terminology being offensive to various areas of feminism. I used the term “trans rights activists” and did not know it’s a term loaded with offense for trans women. I literally just meant activists for trans rights — so I am trying to learn how to be a better ally but also just learn the language changes and how and when it transformed so it’s not just me avoiding words but understanding more deeply. I have listened to podcasts and about to read some books. But I thought this would be a good place to start. I don’t want to burden my trans sisters with my education on this stuff. \n\nTLDR: which words or terminology is loaded in feminism — eg: ‘trans rights activists’ I did not realise was loaded and offensive. Where can I learn what is offensive and learn more about the divide in feminism here?",
