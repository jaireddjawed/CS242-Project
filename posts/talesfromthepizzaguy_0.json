Like 30 seconds later I hear \"Who is it?\", I say \"\\[Store Name\\] Pizza!\" The dude opens up the door and I immediately see the gun in his hand, I'm not a gun dude but, it looked like it was a submachine gun and he had it pointed at the floor not directly at me. I started shitting myself but the dude seemed nice, when I saw the gun I showed him the delivery bag and said: \"is this \\[address name\\]?\" He gave me the right directions and apologized for having a gun out and likewise, I apologized for disturbing him. Needless to say, this scared the absolute shit out of me and has got me rethinking being a delivery driver. Anything similar happen to any of ya'll?",

Eleven hundred men went on this delivery. \n\nTips went down in 12 minutes. Didn't see the first tip for about a half-hour. Sweet old lady - 3 dollars in change. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by how many wheels they have on their walkers.  \n \n\nWhat we didn't know, was that our delivery mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even tell us it was a timed delay order. \n\nVery first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.  \n \n\nSometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... 'til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces. You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many deliveries there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour.  \n \n\nMonday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. \n\nAt noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. \n\nI'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, February 27, 2023.  \n \n\n Anyway, we delivered the pizza.\"",

        "text": "I was a pizza guy for 4 years. Started at 16. Quit at 18. Came back at 20 and left again at 22. I saw a post from a pizza guy on r/ama and I didn’t have a question for him, but I wanted to reminisce a bit. I’m 23 now and to be honest I miss the grind. Just wish people tipped more. Here are some short stories I can potentially elaborate on if anyone is interested :)\n\n1. Naked man streaking the highway being chased by cops. I didn’t see much as I was driving 60 mph and on the clock, but he was definitely buck naked.\n\n2. Stopped for gas and had two large men run out the store. They were fighting (mostly pushing) one threw a trash can at the other’s truck as he drove off. I know anyone can see that not just drivers. It just stuck with me since I wouldn’t have been there if I wasn’t working.\n\n3. Delivered to a bachelorette party and got invited to be the pregame for the real stripper. I was recently 18 and was debating saying yes ($100 tip) but the real stripper showed up so they were no longer interested in me. I was not informed of the party, but I was very suspicious when I saw tons of cars, and I had like 2 pizzas and the door said “please CUM inside” it was like 2-3 weeks before the first time I quit.\n\n4. Entrance to a road I needed was blocked by a fatal car accident. I pulled over behind the fire trucker and hopped out because my delivery was like 2 houses away figured I’d just walk (no other entrances anyway so I would’ve had to wait) The firefighter I asked said I was fine to do that just don’t look at the wreck when passing by. I wasn’t super close, but I looked. I wish I didn’t.\n\n5. Went to the wrong house. The homeowner pulled in after me. I was in the process of saying something like “oh hey did you order—” when he decked me in the mouth. I ate the punch like a badass and was like “this the wrong house?” He said yeah then realize I was just a pizza guy. Many apologies and he paid me to not say anything. So I left. I didn’t have a topper on my car at the time. Our store didn’t have any for awhile.\n\n6. Got bit by a little yapping dog. I kicked at him cause he bit pretty hard. The owner yelled at me. While getting yelled at I made sure he knew I didn’t give a shit if he sued me since his dog broke skin I’d win. Gave him the pizza. No tip.\n\n7. Almost got mauled by 3 pit bulls. Fenced in yard. I wasn’t sure I had the right house. No number. So I called them and no one answered so I decided screw it and went in the gate. As soon as it closed behind me I saw 3 pits bolt out from around the house. They stopped. Stared at me. And I froze till they came charging again. I used the pizza bag as a sort of shield while trying not to fuck up the pizzas. I was swinging it like it was a torch and they were zombies scared of fire. Opened the gate and finally the customer came out from the noise and was very apologetic, but no tip. Shitty neighborhood.\n\nThat’s all I can remember right now, but I know have more hidden in my soul somewhere.",

        "text": "I work night shift as a pizza driver in my local college town and tonight (Wednesday the 15) on one of my deliveries in the last hour we were open a guy who was very drunk called the store and ordered delivery to a nearby dorm. The guy called back 9 minutes later to check where the pizza was, to which the manager responded, irritably that it was just coming out of the oven. I got the pizza and drove to deliver it with a warning about the guy being drunk from my boss. I get there and tell the guy his total and exchange the pizza as he hands me the money. I know I should always wait to hand the pizza over until I count but typically people are nice especially when drunk, and if they do short you it’s by accident, I haven’t had someone intentionally try to short me before (most students don’t want to screw over someone else their own age who’s working), but this time as I’m telling the guy he’s 10$ short of his 29$ total he just keeps walking inside, as I hurry after him I realize it’s a dorm that locks at night and I’m now locked out. Luckily for me it’s got windows throughout the whole lobby and I can see that he has gone maybe 10 feet from the door and sat at a table with two girls right next to the windows. I go up to the window after attempting to call him and knock on the glass. He doesn’t seem to hear so I try a few more times by which the girls have both looked at me wondering wtf I am doing. I mouth the words at first but worry they can’t understand me so I write on Snapchat and turn the phone so they can see “you still owe me money” to which he ignores intentionally refusing to look at me but both girls suddenly start to realize the situation looked shocked that he is refusing to pay me and ignoring me. At this point I’m getting irritated because I’m expected to turn in that cash at the end of the night and whatever I get extra is what I keep. If I lose 10$ I’m losing any tip, the gas I spent driving there, my time, and the literal 10$ so I tell them by typing on my phone I’m expected to pay for whatever he doesn’t so we all clearly understand the choice he’s making. The dude continues to ignore me and it’s only 10$ so I’m only willing to waste so much time before I gave up a minute later. As I was walking away both girls jaws had dropped in disbelief and although the fact they had lost all respect for the guy was satisfying, it wasn’t enough and I wish there was a better way to get back at him (*legally* I can’t lose my job obviously) with his name, number, and dorm. I thought about messaging the dudes mom on Facebook and telling her that the money she sends her son gets spent on getting shitfaced at 2 am on Wednesday nights and stealing from minimum wage employees. I decided not to do anything yet to see if my fury subsides but man is it dehumanizing to be disrespected to blatantly and just have to take it.",

My store is in a strip mall on what is mostly a 55mph divided highway, 2 lanes in each direction, with a few intersections and stop lights along the way.\n\nI am returning to the store in the Southbound 55mph zone, probably doing 65mph. Karen pulls out of a neighborhood on the left. Crosses the 2 Northbound lanes and doesn't even slow down in the median where most people would stop. She just pulls right into the left hand Southbound lane that I am in. She's far enough ahead of me that it doesn't even phase me though. I calmly move to the right hand lane to pass her then get back into the left lane.\n\nAbout a mile later I see in my rear view mirror that she has caught up to me and is riding my ass screaming bloody murder and flipping me off. Being 30 years ago I can't remember if I laughed out loud or not, but I was definitely wondering wtf?\n\nAnother mile later I pull into the store's parking lot. She missed the 1st entrance so was pulling in the next one as I walked to the store. I go straight to my manager to tell him about her. We see her park and get out of her car so he tells me to go in back and he will handle it.\n\nI'm not sure what she said at first because I was telling the story to other employees, but then I crept back towards the front of the store where I could hear her saying that I was flipping her off and she had a child in the car what a bad example blah blah blah etc. etc. So I calmly walk to the front and say \"Actually she was flipping ME off and screaming the f-word repeatedly in front of her child.\" She said something stupid I can't remember and stormed off. Manager and other employees laughed with me.",

Delivery instructions say to look for a white picket fence, don't see any but there's a regular wooden fence at the end point (Lol idiot customers). To set up this road, it's a small artery in a subdivision, 2 driveways in front of a single house, woods everywhere, and then another driveway that leads into the woods and 2 other houses. All of this on the left side of the road at a dead end with no street lights.\n\nGPS takes me to the 2 houses set in the back, as I pull up I notice one house has all the lights on and a women out front waving at me. Cool, thanks for making it easy lady! She meets me at my car and the conversation goes something like this:\n\nMe: That'll be $xx.xx\n\nHer: My husband was supposed to pay for it with a card?\n\nMe: Oh... Nope, sorry it's not paid for! We can call the store and you can pay over the phone if you'd like...\n\nHer: I don't have a card...\n\n*... Awkwardness intensifies*\n\nShe walks away and I apologize for basically taunting her with the pizza in my hands that she can't pay for. Feelsbadman.jpg\n\n**BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!**\n\nGet back to the store, and am told I went to the wrong place. Guy doesn't even have a wife.\n\nThat wasn't the right house. The house I was supposed to be at was behind the first house I saw. Turns out this lady has been stealing this guy's deliveries for a while which is why he switched to cash orders. I drove back and finally find the white picket fence, which is set like 20 feet back from the road (Lol, idiot drivers) and meet this dude who tells me all of this.\n\nThe audacity of some people is crazy man. Also, how the fuck was she so ready for me to get there?!?! Does she just sit by the window waiting for strange cars to drive down so she can grift them for free food? Who has that kinda time? And her acting skills were amazing. At no point did I think something was wrong with her story. I just thought her husband was a dick.... Does she even have a husband?",

It wasn’t a serious accident though. \n\nI got a letter from a lawyer filing an enclosed “complaint and discovery.” Basically it seems she is suing me and my old pizza place for “bodily injury” which is total bullshit, and GEICO denied the claims because I told them I was delivering pizza (stupid mistake) and had to have a different type of insurance for that. I have only liability insurance. \n\nThis goes beyond my policy limits, but I was told by my insurance company that they are gonna set up a defense lawyer, but I may be responsible for my own “council.” But I can’t really know much until my claims agent is back in her office on Monday.

My manager was even more tired and walked out on us last week. Now the district manager is coming in to pick up the slack and well... he's cracking under the exact same pressure as our old AM was. Dude's posting on our work chat app about aprons that haven't been put away properly and not putting personal objects in the \"office\" area. Like sure maybe that's policy, but if the first thing you do when taking over for an overworked AM who quit on the spot maybe you're not tackling things the right way.\n\nI honestly dread going to work, I don't want to deal with the DM's bull, and last time he had to emergency cover for an AM he shut down delivery two hours early and I left my shift with f'all in tips. I'm considering moving to another store, but this franchise controls all the chains of the place I work currently. One of the other big three might be appealing, and my roommate was a former manager at one so sliding in shouldn't be too hard, but I'm worried I'm walking into the exact same type of mess given how all delivery places are hurting for staff.\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be helpful.  \n\n\nEdit: I want to mention, I've been a driver and a manager before.

        "text": "Ive been looking for a new job. Something easy, not to hard, laid back.\nI thought about a pizza delivery driver and that sounded cool the more i thought about it. I get to just drive around, deliver pizzas, listen to music, how hard can it be?(ofc i know it might be more than that and not that simple but i feel like thats the jist of it)\n\nAnyways, i applied to dominos pizza for the position last night. No longer than 30 minutes later a number texting me asking me about my application and if i want an interview the next day. \n\nIs this a red flag?? I see this as the place might be understaffed and they are desperate for drivers and if thats the case, what if they over work me(i applied for a part time position about 20-25 hours, 3-4 days). This makes it seem like the workers there might not be happy working there.\n\nAs well as what are some questions i could ask that could clarify all this and really make sure this is the job for me? \nIs working at domino’s even worth it? The place is in a relatively nice area as well i forgot to mention. I hear every location is different in pay. What would be a base pay that would make it worth it ? Because im not willing to work this if im paid a base pay of 12 and + tips its about 17 that seems like bs to me\n\nTL;DR: i applied to dimonos and they got back asking for an interview the next day, is this a red flag ? What should i consider when going to this interview or working at doninos?",

On my typical day, I have to do pretty much every things: Washing dishes, sweep, mop, takeout trash. It takes at least 2 hours to wash all the dishes at my store. However, on a busy day, I have non-stop order until the last minutes, guess what? I have to work over time to finish all of these tasks. And Domino is so cheap, we used to have 2 people closing, now they cut off the labor and only 1 person to do all the work. Is this normal to you guys? Or this can be considered as  labor exploitation.\n\nThere's one day this week, we only have 2 people at the store: 1 insider and me as a driver where we're supposed to have 4 workers (the other 2 had emergency). I worked non-stop without taking a break until 11pm, We close at 12. And I refuse to take order after 11, because I had to clean up the store which take more than 2 hours. The next day, I heard the supervisor criticized my manager that: \"why not taking order, if you have driver there, just \"use\" him.\"\n\nAgain, is this normal to you guys? Or this can be considered as  labor exploitation.",

However, I eventually decided to just resume my delivery. I didn’t pay much more attention to it until I was turning into the neighborhood I was delivering to and the same car had followed me two turns in. At this point I knew something was up so I made a different turn not towards the address and sure enough the car followed me again. At this point I turn out of the neighborhood and call my manager , all while the car is still following me. My manager tells me to wait until they get to the store and to go there once they are there. So I keep driving and meanwhile this car keeps following me after every turn. At one point they drove parallel to me and stopped next to me at a red light. I didn’t make eye contact with them. Eventually my manager told me to go back to the store, and after I made another detour into a neighborhood they stopped following me. Do you think they were going to just yell at me? Or do you think they had a more malicious intent?",

        "text": "So I'm not a great story teller and this happened literally last night, so this is largely a string of consciousness. I'm not sure about a lot of stuff still and I'm still processing it. But hey at least I'm in the club for having a crazy fucking story delivering pizza.\n\nAnyway, I got a delivery for a place about a mile north, northwest of the pizza place I work. I head over there and see a guy standing outside of the building I am delivering to, he's wearing a spotted mask so I figure OK, this must be the guy, his place must be behind another house and it's awkward to get there so he probably figured to meet me outside. I exit my car and ask the guy how he's doing, his name and that I need a signature. I notice at this point he's clearly drunk having a hard time comprehending what I'm saying and balancing. He was saying gibberish  that sounded like \"Ial ready bpaind\", \"shedd payed paizza\". Getting closer I realize his mask is lopsided and rather than spotted, it was covered in blood, he's bleeding from his nose and busted his lip.\n\nAt this point I figure it's an orange flag leaning towards red, I think he's not doing great, but that isn't necessarily a sign that he's in danger. I figure he's drunk and fucking ate shit outside of his apartment and busted his lip. He even said fairly coherently \"I bussed my lip\". Sucks, but not the end of the world. Over time however he's stumbling more and more and having a harder and harder time standing. He's having a REALLY hard time comprehending what I'm saying and has only brief moments of sapience. Saying nonesense like \"shepep paid\" and \"cardica arres\" between \"I bus lip\", and \"fell over\". So I figure, OK he's severely concussed, I need to call 911. \n\nI tell him to lean on something, and he gives me a big fucking hug, say \"I lvovoe you\", normally I'd be like fuck off dude. But I just think to myself gross but not important right now. He's clearly injured and his health is more important than my comfort right now. (As an aside, he's a great hugger and by some miracle of God or Satan, I didn't get any of his blood on me, but somehow it got on the receipt and pizza box). In retrospect this must have been a weird sight to behold, a pizza guy refusing to give this guy a pizza and now these two fat guys are hugging.\nHe then gets the picture and instead grabs my hands with his huge hands to try and keep balance using my hands. His hands are **covered in grime and grossness** and are fucking FREEZING. \n\nI think I got the whole idea on what happened at this point. It was wet outside and he probably tripped while walking out, he probably tried to break the fall and landed in the soft soil while his head probably hit the sidewalk. He gets spooked by the idea of 911 coming saying \"they're gonna get me, they're gonna kill me!\" and he tries to bring me into his apartment and close the door behind us. I say no, but I am willing to stand in the threshold to make sure he doesn't hurt himself. He's freaking out and eventually the EMTs come and help him out, asking me a few questions about what he knows and such and they tell me I'm free to go. As another aside, I had no reason to believe he was going to try and hurt me or anything. I don't believe I was in danger, but he clearly was, If I felt I was in danger I would have not left the sidewalk.\n\nI get back in the car and I try to find some wet wipes to wipe down my hands, when I realize, wait a minute, they're completely clean. Then it fucking hits me. His hands weren't grimy, they were purple/blue in the dark and clammy. His hands weren't getting any circulation. He wasn't dirty, he was grey and desaturated because he wasn't getting blood circulation, **\"cardica arres\" = \"Cardiac Arrest\"**. This man may have been actually having a fucking heart attack. Of course I don't know for sure but the symptoms seem consistent.\n\nAfter that fucking mental crisis realizing that Oh fuck I might have been the only reason that guy is getting help and he probably would have died if I wasn't there. I make one more delivery because \"Ain't No Rest for the Wicked\" started playing on my playlist on fucking cue and I can't just let that slip by. I get back to the pizza place and tell my co-workers about what just happened and I found out the most wild part. According to the person who took the order, HE DIDN'T ORDER PIZZA, HIS FRIEND DID OUT OF THE BLUE FOR HIM. I don't know if it was a spur of the moment thing or if I was a very strange wellness check.\n\nSo...yeah.\nI have a job interview next week for an IT position for a nearby city. If I get that job, I'm not sure if I should believe in fate or something. I have been having such a hard time using my CS degree to get a job, and if I get one RIGHT after doing that I feel as though I was meant to flounder around in this pizza place for a while to help this guy out. Anyway... glad to be a part of the crazy delivery stories gang. Do I get a 20% off on pizza here?",

My most concerning one is when my chest tightens up and I get short of breath really easy.\n\nI went to the drs and got checked and its all fine, it really just seems to be like stress caused muscle tension.\n\nBut if I have to constantly be fighting shortness of breath while like physically straining myself im just gonna panic constantly.\n\nShould I be fine?

If the customer doesn't pick up the phone then what? \n\nGoing inside a screened off area is basically walking inside someones house which we arent allowed to do and it just feels extremely intrusive so I always call people when they order and they have a screened door. \n\nI also see many houses with a doorbell, BUT its inside the screened door. What the hell is even the point of the doorbell? It may as well be inside the house.\n\n I cant knock on the door either since its airgapped from the front door and the house. \n\nSo last night that exact situation happened. I drove to a customers house and their patio was screened off so I called them. No response, tried again 2 more times and nothing. Left a text and waited 5 minutes. Nothing. Called my manager at the store and they called and left a voice mail. Nothing. So just in case they replied I waited for like 10 minutes since it wasnt too busy. They never replied so I headed back to the store.\n\n\nFast forward one hour, I am at home since my shift is over and I get 5 missed calls and a text saying \"Im outside.\" Not sure if this dude was expecting me to wait an hour for him or what but thats what I got. He then finally got the hint to call the store instead of spam calling my number 5 times. Apparently he was angry because driver didn't knock on the door. Go figure.

I once delivered a pizza to a woman and the bill total came to $9.99 (this was also before they added tipping charges to the bill). I got the pizza there on time and perfectly fine and when she goes to pay she hands me a $10 bill. Okay, whatever I take the money realizing she isn't gonna tip me and start to walk away. The woman goes \"okay then\" so I stopped and turned around sorta confused but also a little jokingly said \"oh, did you want the penny?\" and she says \"yeah, I collect them\". So I had to stand there and look for a penny, which I didn't have in my pocket because no one ever asked for the penny back on a delivery and had to go find one in my car as she stood there waiting for her \"change\". I will never forget that. Every time I drove by that house I wanted to throw a bunch of pennies on her front porch, but I wasn't gonna waste my time or money to do it. I almost get it if you are broke and \"need\" that penny, but if that's the case why are you ordering pizza? Spend 10 dollars on actual food from the store that'll last longer than a pizza. I almost wanna say, am I the asshole? lol",

That said, I had a thought and wanted to see what you all think about this.\n\nOk, so we all acknowledge that photography is art, right? \nWe also acknowledge that a photo of a mountain peak is art, but the mountain itself is not art, right? The art is in the act of the photographer choosing the right angle, lighting, weather, etc to capture the mountain in that specific way. \n\nLet’s also set aside the issue of copyright with AI art, and assume that there’s some way to fix that with AIs that only generate art off images specifically created for an AI to use with the permission of the original artists. Big assumption, I know, but work with me here.\n\nIn that situation, how would AI art fundamentally differ from photography? In both cases, a human is not creating the subject matter of the image, they’re just selectively choosing what subject matter to display. The art would not be in the subject matter but in the usage of the tool to generate the desired subject matter and then in choosing the preferred image to fit the vision of a human.\n\nThoughts?",

I love delivering but I don’t know if I will be able to drive for awhile. I got shaken up pretty bad. this is up there with the worst things that I’ve ever experienced.",

She asked why, and I told her that my family was 150 miles away, so if I worked at all, I didn't get a holiday.  She said she'd talk to the district manager, but I doubt she did.\n\nSo the schedule came out at 9:45 on Sunday night, you know, as last-minute as you can get and wouldn't you know it?  She has me opening on Xmas.  I immediately texted her that I wouldn't be there that day and her response was to be upset that I was texting her about work so late.  I told her I was willing to get fired over this and she was just like \"GOOD NIGHT.\" I simply replied \"I texted you as soon as the schedule came out, the timing was not mine.\" \n\nImagine posting a schedule at 10 pm and getting upset when you get a text at 10 PM.\n\nXmas is the busiest day of the year?  So what?  What shift is the owner picking up?  Is the district manager delivering pizzas?  No?  Then they can fuck right off.  \n\nThis job is disposable, my family isn't.  Seeing mom and dad for xmas is mandatory, working at Papa fucking John's is not. \n\nSorry to rant, I'm just pissed and feel like the company has mistreated me.",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nI just want to vent about a situation, I know I am in the wrong for being inconsiderate but I just wanted to get some thoughts.\n\nMy wife and I ordered a pizza and we have a 3.5 year old English Bulldog. Like most English bulldogs she is dumb, stubborn, but sweet loving and a cuddle monster. She is always excited to meet new people and go sniff them.\n\nWell when the pizza delivery guy came, I stupidly didn’t think of crating her and just tried to hold her back at the door with my foot while fetching the pizza. But she slipped out of the door and went up to the pizza guy to sniff and say hi. Unfortunately, the pizza guy freaked out saying a need to get her in and telling me “he carries” which sounds like some thinly veiled threat. \n\nHe then was talking kinda panicked about some pst experience where a dog bit him. I tried to get my wife to help either grab the pizzas or fetch the dog but she did neither because she was in her undies so I was out on a limb. Anyways, after an agonizing 20-30 seconds the dog came back inside. \n\nAfter that the guy calmed down, I had been repeatedly apologizing because I felt embarrassed and I sympathize with the guy since he had bad experiences around dogs. I am pretty upset myself though about the statement saying “he carries”.\n\nRight when he said that I immediately panicked a bit internally myself, “is this guy about to shoot my sweet dog out of fear?”, I only responded with “I understand, we will get her inside”, but that seemed like a very unnecessary escalation.\n\nAgain, I am in the wrong for not properly controlling my dog, and I take this as a learning experience to always crate her, not everyone responds to dogs the same way. I also get that he was scared and probably just speaking out of fear, but I am a bit worried if someone gets that spooked over a dog that isn’t showing any signs of attack and already starts talking about pulling out guns.\n\nAnyways, thanks for letting me vent. Never thought I would be stressed over a pizza delivery.",

I paid for her food and told the store I delivered it and she paid for it.

        "text": "I live in an apartment building.  My across the hall neighbor is an older lady, very much a drunk, who goes through phases of not shutting her apartment door.  As in she will prop it open from when she wakes up to whenever she passes out at night.  The one time we questioned it with building management I was very sick and her constant cigarette smoke was aggravating it.  We were told it was a fire code violation and she would be spoken to.  Soon after we had her banging on our door screaming that she's lived here forever and can do whatever the f*** she wants.  After that we mostly try to ignore it.\n\nNow...she also considers herself a \"dog rescuer\".  So there are often times where she has some dog or other in there.  With her door still propped open.\n\nWhy does all this matter?  Well, when I got home from work last night  I ordered delivery from a chicken place.  My husband was the one who went to the door to retrieve it.  I heard an awful racket.  Apparently the dog my neighbor has over there right now has been barking and growling and lunging at anyone moving in the hall.  And I guess my takeout chicken was a tempting target?  My husband told me that the dog lunged at the delivery guy and the guy literally used my bag of food as a shield/peace offering.  Hubs rescued it before the dog got it but...I'm still wondering what to think here.\n\nI feel annoyed at my neighbor obviously, but a mix of annoyance and guilt regarding the driver.  Annoyance that his solution was apparently to sacrifice my food to the dog to save himself and guilt that he was put in that situation to begin with.  I'm wondering if I should be trying to call the restaurant and apologize - I ordered through the app and have no idea who the delivery guy was so I wouldn't even know for sure what to say.  It also wasn't my dog (we don't even have a pet) and I don't think the guy was hurt at all - just startled.  My husband said he'd intervened and my neighbor had managed to get the dog back before anything actually happened.\n\nSo...do I actually need to do anything?\n\nWhat do you delivery people think of having to deliver to places with pets?",

        "text": "I’ve learned a lot as a consumer from you all on this sub so I wanna get your take on what happened last evening. \n\nOrdered a large pizza delivery from a local chain about 1.5 miles from my home. Paid $12 online and included a $3 tip. Turned out, my pizza was made wrong…so I called the store, offered to return the incorrect pie for a corrected order and got told to keep it and they’d have another out to me asap. Manager, obviously looking at my order history and seeing I have rarely ever call back, was apologetic about their error. I’m not a Karen, so it was a pleasant convo because, hey, we all make mistakes. \n\nI tipped the first driver already &amp; I dont know why, but I was expecting to see the same driver for my 2nd delivery. A different driver actually delivered my corrected pizza so I had him wait while I scrambled to grab my purse and handed him another $3 tip.  \n\nQuestions: Is it common to send 2 different delivery drivers to the same house when a 1st pizza is wrong? Did I do the right thing by tipping the 2nd driver? Or does the first driver have to split tip from my 1st delivery with the 2nd delivery driver? I guess not seeing the same driver on the 2nd delivery threw me off and I’m asking so I handle a situation like this the right way. \n\nAny feedback/thoughts/opinions welcome. Thanks!",

I'm trying to figure out which one will get me more tips at the end of every night (Friday through Sunday). I asked the drivers at each store, but none of them wanted to tell me how much they made, and some simply said it depends on the night. I think the Papa John's location has to see more orders due to it being near a college, but Domino's in the gentrified area should see bigger tips since the people there live in luxury apartments and 600k + townhomes.",

At a pizzeria, this could mean you want all the toppings that the restaurant has, or it could mean that you want a pizza they sell called \"the works,\" which happens to have a lot of toppings. Today is dedicated to eating these pizzas, except there is one caveat: you can't have any anchovies on them! \n\nEnjoy ;) [https://generatorfun.com/pizza-generator](https://generatorfun.com/pizza-generator)",
