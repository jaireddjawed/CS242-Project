        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/10f9ij5/gov_kathy_hochul_is_preparing_to_sue_senate/",
        "text": "A few weeks ago, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul nominated Hector LaSalle to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, replacing Chief Justice Janet DiFiore. Up until now, Hochul has been a fairly lowkey governor who usually would work with the legislature to pass their agenda.\n\nHowever, the NY State Senate is not too pleased with Hochul's pick. Democrats, who have a supermajoirty in the chamber, are opposed to LaSalle's nomination, citing LaSalle's [anti-union and anti-abortion rulings](https://www.commondreams.org/news/hector-lasalle). Hochul has argued these rulings only tell one part of a story and should not impact the impartialness of LaSalle.\n\nAs per NY Senate rules, any judiciary nominee must first pass through the judiciary committee, and it is heavily implied LaSalle will not survive a committee vote, therefore denying him a full floor vote.\n\nIn response, [Hochul's office retained a litigator, ex-state solicitor general Caitlin Halligan, for a likely legal battle with Senate Democrats over Hector LaSalle's nomination. At issue: whether nominee can be voted down in the Judiciary Committee or requires a full chamber vote](https://twitter.com/ChrisBragg1/status/1615500689643388929?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), effectively bypassing the judiciary committee where Hochul will seek Republican votes to confirm her nominee since she does not have enough Democratic votes.\n\nMy questions are: does this legal strategy have any chance of succeeding? And second, does this signal a return to Cuomo-style politics? Cuomo was incredibly involved with the legislature, to the point of being able to strong-arm a lot of members, which is why the Senate jumped at the chance to impeach Cuomo when his scandals broke. Does this seem like Hochul is trying the same strategy?",
