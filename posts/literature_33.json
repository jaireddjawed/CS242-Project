        "text": "Hello, r/Literature, I have a few thoughts on a recent read and wanted to see who might discuss with me.\n\nI just finished Faulkner's *Light in August* last night after an admittedly rough couple months trying to get through it. I am also no stranger to Faulkner, having read 5 other novels by him. I consider him to be my favorite author, and *The Sound and the Fury* remains my favorite novel of all time by far. With this in mind, I knew I needed to grapple with this novel at some point, it being the only one of his four 'masterworks' many critics and fans alike claim to be his best. So I dove in, and have a few thoughts on the book. First of all, I truly believe the book is about 100-150 pages too long. The book seems to drag in many points, and even as someone who can enjoy the Faulknerian pacing and lyrical flourishes in prose, much of it seemed rather inconsequential to the narrative arc as a whole. That being said, the plot was fascinating, and featured some of Faulkner's most memorable characters. While Lena seems to fit pretty narrowly into the standard Faulkner \"sympathetic fallen/sullied woman\" category, Rev. Hightower and Joe Christmas provide a very cool character study. Joe Christmas's struggle with his mixed race heritage was not quite as well fleshed out as it gets with the Sutpens in *Absalom, Absalom!* in my opinion, but the scene where Joe was running back and forth between the white and Black sections of Jefferson was nothing short of phenomenal. Rev. Hightower's arc was also interesting, and the scene in which his life flashes before him and he mentally and spiritually prepares for death very much reminded me of *Ray* by Barry Hannah. (Does anyone know exactly how much Faulkner influenced his fellow Mississippian?) The plot kept me very much paying attention when Faulkner actually pushed it forward, but he lost me more than once in his forays off into his own writing. Faulkner's attention to detail on the human psyche and his undertanding of America and its many complex and curious attitudes remain unparalled, but his clumsiness on matters of race and gender still do remain. (I do think most fans of Faulkner still acknowledge and accept this, even me as a Black person) Overall, the book clearly has merit and gave me some incredible characters and scenes to remember, but I find it to be the least enthralling of Faulkner's masterworks, and it honestly probably comes to 5th of the 6 Faulkner novels I've ever read. At any rate, it's still a cool book, and a phenomenal intro to Faulkner due to its lack of narrative experimentation. \n\nWhat do you all think of the book, or Faulkner in general? Am I off base in my criticisms?",
