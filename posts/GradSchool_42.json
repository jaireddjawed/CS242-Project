        "text": "Starting a Masters in Social Work program in January with the eventual goal to earn my LCSW and practice psychotherapy. \n\nIn my undergrad I took several courses in Social Work, one of which gave me concern for the post I'm writing now. To cut long matters short, I received poor grades in one of my classes on social justice due to what I believe were idealogical differences between my professors and myself, despite putting in good effort into my assignments and involvement in class discussions.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with SW, it is a field with a heavy emphasis on social issues. Ultimately I don't think it's a bad thing in and of itself given the nature of many SW jobs. It can, however, lead to intolerance of challenging views that do not coincide directly with what is expected.\n\nFundamentally, I agreed with the vast majority of my professors views in our class discussions. But I felt that our discussions were always too much a matter of virtue signaling and uncritical agreement for the sake of believing in what the professor wanted us to believe. In my undergrad, this ultimately didn't matter too much. I dropped the course and went on to graduate from my program without it hindering me in any way. Having said that, I am more concerned now that I will be studying at the graduate level.\n\nAs I mentioned, I am planning to practice therapy after graduation. At the same time, I have many, deeply critical concerns related to psychotherapy as a field. This is due to many years of my own experiences in therapy, as well as personally knowing many therapists personally for a very long time. My criticisms are well thought out and, I believe, can be substantiated through other academic literature in the field. These criticisms truly cut to the core of what it means to practice psychotherapy, and I know they will inevitably come up at various points throughout my program.\n\nEven so, I believe that psychotherapy has the potential to benefit many people when undertaken in the right way, and that is why I've decided to do this program. Ultimately, I believe my critical but thoughtful views of psychotherapy will be my biggest assets in my studies and my practice.\n\nHere is where my concern lies. I am afraid that, due to my strong criticisms of psychotherapy, I will eventually receive retaliation from my professors in the course of my studies. I am not willing to sacrifice what I believe is right just to pass. \n\nWhat is your advice here? What steps can I take to protect myself academically? Should I disclose my views upfront to my program and professors? For context, they are all well-practiced in the field. Thank you.\n\n**TLDR:** I'm concerned about retaliation from my professors due to likely idealogical differences, and looking for advice about how I can address this issue.",

I did two internships last year and so moved back to my parents because they were closer. So now, I'm back in my tiny hometown with no library or cafes or any place outside my house to study.

My first two chapters are 99% done (a few words or footnotes I may want to change), chapter 3 is textually fine, but has 3 sources in its entirety. My fourth chapter has footnotes but little substance and I haven't started on my introduction or conclusion yet. I'm literally doing 1-2 hours of work everyday which is like reading 2 pages. My big goal was to finish in 2022 and I haven't even come close. I'm aware it's my own behavior but I'm just so disappointed, I don't know how to tough it out anymore.",

When I first came into college I was very much so into the Army and wanted to make it a career but have since grown far more interested in my academic endeavors within Psychology and realized I want to pursue a PhD and ultimately conduct research and teach.\n\nI can fulfill my commitment either by going active duty which would delay my entry to grad school by 4-6 years based on when I get a slot to go to training and when I am able to get out, both of which are hard to predict exactly or by going into the Reserves. The Reserve route might require me to defer admissions for a year to go to my job training or possible take a LOA one semester, but would allow for me to hopefully enter immediately following undergrad. The caveat is that for the next 6 years post undergrad I will have training ~1 weekend a month and 2 weeks in the summer.\n\nI think given my career goals and lack on interest in being an army psychologist I'd be most happy going the Reserves route, my only concern is if I'd be setting myself up for failure in my academic endeavors. I've heard so many mixed things on the matter. My Cadre has all told me it is certainly manageable, and I've had two professors agree with them and two disagree. Was hoping to hear specifically from someone who has done it themselves or knows someone who has done it. Or if you just have general comments on the feasibility of such a commitment while in a PhD program. I understand the likelihood I won't finish as fast as some of my peers.",

Everything honestly looks wonderful on paper. \n\nMy program is halfway across the country from my home. It's also in an area that I honestly wouldn't have moved to if it weren't for school. I adapted to life here and at one point even considered staying in the area after I graduate. \n\nOne of my trips to visit home in the past year is where things started to change. It just really hit me how much I love and miss being with my family. We weren't really ever family-oriented, but I feel like we've all come to value spending time together ever since I left our home state. I find myself basking in simple moments like being able to walk over and chat with one of them when I feel bored, or just sitting in silence with them. \n\nI just got back to school after the holiday weekend. And it has been very, very hard to come back. I do have friends here, but I feel like we're all always stressed and don't have as much time for each other. My friends also have families and outside support systems here. So I guess having to be at school also brings out this sense of not feeling like I have somewhere to belong to either. Given my living situation here, I also feel a sense of loneliness and sadness on a more regular basis. I thought that things would get easier as time goes on, but I feel like I only feel worse after having to leave at the end of each of my visits.\n\nThat being said, does anyone have any survival tips or comforting words that can help me toughen this out for the next few years? I've decided that I want to apply to internships and post-docs as close to home as I can, but I just want to find a way to manage these intensifying feelings while I have to stay here.",

I know grad school is no walk in the park and I'm prepared to put the work in. I've taken some non-matriculated philosophy and psych courses after graduating, I can study hard for the GRE, and might even have a couple of good references/letters of recommendation, but I don't have research experience and thus no published pieces (and the writing sample for the application is quite daunting because of this). I graduated in 2020 and am 26 next year if that matters.\n\nTL:DR - Bad GPA and no research experience but I want to turn it around. Can I get into a decent grad program?

        "text": "Helloo! I was wondering if anyone had any advice regarding feelings of wanting to drop out? \n\nI loved my biology undergrad course, did really well with it and figured my next move would be postgrad. I came across a last minute masters by research project advertisement that looked interesting and it was funded (!!) so I of course applied and managed to get it. \n\nI'm a couple of months in now and really unhappy. I don't get on with my supervisor and feel very out of my depth with everything. I'm behind on my coursework and experimental work and have an upcoming presentation assessment which I'm absolutely dreading. I don't feel at all invested in what I'm doing and everyday feels like a bigger and bigger task just turning up everyday. Dropping out is on my mind pretty much constantly! \n\nOn the other hand, I enjoy being in a university environment, I'm making lots of new friends and doing new things, and living in a new city which is making me happy. If I drop out, I'll lose access to all the things I'm enjoying outside of my course, and I also won't have any income. \n\nI'm really torn on what to do. My hunch is that I should stay, but I don't have it in me to give this year all my effort like I did at undergrad. Is it very bad to stay on a course with the mindset that you're going to do the bare minimum to get by? I feel like I'm sh*tting on my supervisors and industrial funder, but on the other hand I feel unsupported and overwhelmed. \n\nI'm pretty sure I am very much capable of postgraduate level study, but I think the circumstances of this project and personal circumstances (long term relationship ended suddenly and unexpectedly in the midst of a very complicated start to the year due to funding/ accommodation difficulties) have sent me in a bit of a spiral early on that I'm struggling to pick myself up from in time to catch up with the project. I also wonder if, once I get into experimental work, I'll feel better about things. I really want to learn new skills in academia/ research, it just feels like the wrong time or maybe wrong project for me. \n\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thatâ€™s quite common. They know the basics, but theyâ€™ll need me to teach them the ropes. Sometimes related to our discipline, sometimes more workplace specific stuff. \nSometimes they actively ask, other times I notice that they might need to know something and let them know. Itâ€™s not a full time job to mentor them, but Iâ€™m available and will answer them if they need anything. I wouldnâ€™t dream of ignoring their requests.\n\nNow I have a very friendly and lovely supervisor and so far Iâ€™ve been a strong and independent student. \nHowever I do need their help.\nIâ€™ve currently been waiting for a reply to an email for over a week, concerning very specific and important questions regarding analysing my data. Itâ€™s kind of a crossroad.\n\nIâ€™ve followed up the email with suggestions and also suggested several times and dates for a meeting.\n\nI havenâ€™t received a reply, which I find kind of strange. I donâ€™t have all the time in the world here.\n\nOne of the reasons Iâ€™m in this situation is because they advised me to do something thatâ€™s just way too complex for an MA. Itâ€™s more the scope of a PhD.\nI therefore get the impression that the particular theoretical framework Iâ€™ve chosen, is outside of my SVâ€™s expertise. Thatâ€™s fine, and I understand that it can take time to familiarise oneself with stuff. But thatâ€™s kind of their job, right?\n\nHowever maybe Iâ€™m totally wrong in terms of my expectations? Maybe theyâ€™re not a mentor after all, but more like a lifeguard who will throw you a rope to avoid you from drowning, but other than that, itâ€™s the studentâ€™s responsibility to try to swim and avoid getting out of our debt (spelling?)? \n\nI have a hunch this will be very dependent on the person, but yeah. Any thoughts and input in particular from those of you who do supervise, would be greatly appreciated! Who am I and who are they in this strange relationship!?",

No published papers but I have two presentations under my belt, one at a regional ACS meeting.\n\nTons of extracurricular activities. I have been the president of an organization that facilitates food pantry donations for two years. I have applied for and gotten $30,000 in grants for this organization. I have also been a part of the DEI chemistry cohort for 1.5 years now. I organized a DEI symposium at a regional ACS meeting on the cohorts behalf. \n\nI have 3 letters of rec, 1 from my PI I work with, 1 from a current chem professor, and 1 from a current stat professor. I predict that all of them will highly support my application.\n\nHere are all the places I am applying:\nBerkeley, Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, Notre Dame, Colorado State, Carnegie Mellon, and Northwestern.\n\nWhat do you think my chances are of getting into any of these schools? I am nervous because I never did an REU; I had to spend my summers catching up on classes due to my double major. I just donâ€™t want to get my hopes up if my chances are minimal. Thanks!",

On paper, I am Hispanic/Latina (hence, BIPOC). But because I am mixed, I am also White. When I applied to undergrad, I applied to all the Latinx scholarships and did not really think anything was wrong with it. But now, I worry that it is wrong for me to apply, as someone who has the privilege of white skin. Do any other multi-racial/-ethic friends here have thoughts or feelings? Should I just go for it and acknowledge this experience? I think this internal conflict speaks to my greater struggle over the years with my identity and how to identify myself. Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI recently started grad school (MSc) at my current school about three months ago, and I am getting to my breaking point and I'm not sure how much longer and I can hold up. My supervisor has made me cry multiple times, is not encouraging, and is never happy with the work I put in (and does the same to all their students). I also have lost interest in my project topic and it feels like a chore to get up to the bench and work on my research. I have to force myself to get out of bed to go to school and I wake up every morning in tears at the thought of going and working without support from my supervisor.\n\nThe biggest issue I have, however, is where my school is. I stayed at the same school, in the same city, with the same supervisor as my undergrad thesis. I never liked this city and never liked my supervisor.. I stayed because my family was super unsupportive of me moving far away and my boyfriend is in the same group that I'm currently in (which I know is not the best reason to have stayed). I had a direct-entry PhD offer at my absolute dream school in my favourite city in the world with an amazing supervisor, but I turned it down because of the distance from where I am now (it is a plane ride away, not just a drive like where I am now). Every single day I cry at the thought of giving up such a great opportunity and how I made myself stay somewhere that I hate when I could have been somewhere that I love.\n\nThe further I get into my current degree, the more I realize that I can't put myself through this for two more years. Is it unheard of to quit a degree partially through and re-start somewhere else? How complicated is it in terms of getting reference letters from the past supervisor, cutting 1-year scholarships short, and putting those three months on my CV?\n\nThank you for reading",
