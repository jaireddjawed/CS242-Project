Adjacent cells of same value form a group, and clicking on a group increments the value of each of its cells. Similarly, right-clicking decrements a group. Increment/decrementing costs 1 move.  \nThe goal is to have only one group left on the board (ie. all the cells have the same value), with the minimum number of moves.\n\n[Here](http://entibo.fr/lvlr) is the prototype.  \nSo here's the question: how to determine the minimum number of moves required to solve a level ?\n\nI feel like there exists an algorithm to properly find it but i can't figure it out.  \nI tried a shortest-path algorithm on the graph of game states but of course starting at N = 4 or 5 it grinds to a halt. Am i doing it wrong ?  \n\nAny help would be much appreciated, even pointers to maybe similar games and how they are solved!\n\nthanks!",

        "text": "I want to show that the following problem is NP-Complete and need a bit of guidance as I think I might be going at it wrong. \n\nThe problem:\n\nWe're looking at a meeting booking system. The input is a list n of possible times as well as m lists (where m &lt;= n), one list per person containing their choice of possible meeting times. For each possible time, a priority number is also given. For each reservation time in the list of n, a cost is also given. (Cost of booking the room). The algorithm should assign times so that the combined priority for those who have booked should be as small as possible while the total cost of booking should not be higher than M.\n\nThe Decision problem would be something like \"Is it possible to to verify if that the total cost of meeting booking does not exceed K and that the total priority is lower than V?\" \n\nNP\n\nSo first to show that it's in NP we should show that given a correct solution it can be verified that it is indeed correct. I guess it should verify that that the cost is below the threshold of K and that the priority of the correct solution is indeed the minimum - both of which can be done in Polynomial time I assume. We traverse through the lists of people, assert that each one has a time granted to them, add up the cost in a variable and at the end of this list assert that the cost is below K. The priority can be dealt with in similar fashion I suppose?\n\nNP Hard\n\nThen to show it's NP Hard I can use the Knapsack Problem since they're rather similar. With input S, size of bag, a list of items with weight w and value v as well as the goal W which is the goal-value. I guess it's clear that S can correlate to cost and that W correlate to the priority? So we want S, the size, to be below S i.e we have the similar condition for the problem above where the cost has to be below K. Then W, the total value should generally exceed W, but in our case we want it to be as low as possible which seems doable.\n\nThe reduction to show it's NP Hard is perhaps not thought out all the way. Some pointers would be very helpful! ",

Currently hovering around 1.8 GPA which is considered as academic probation in my school. The three courses I took were intro programming, discrete math 1 and Calc 1.\n\nDiscrete math was hell. I couldn't fully grasp the concept that was taught in class. Propositional logic, Predicate logic and binary relations were fairly straight forward. Everything after that such as proofs and combinatorics was when I got lost. I spent majority of my time studying discrete math rather than Calc 1 and programming. Went to office hour EVERY WEEK to ask for help. Ended up with 70% before finals then failed the whole course because I didn't pass the final exam.\n\nCalc 1 wasn't as brutal as discrete math. I think I would've done better in Calc if I have done more practice. Ended up with a C in that class.\n\nIntro programming was simple, only learned intro python. Ended up with a B even though I didn't do much studying\n\nIs there any advice that can help me improve my letter grade for next semester? Thanks.\n",

        "text": "Animagraffs research team here. We're learning how microprocessors work and we think we have the steps/ path of information down but would like some feedback. Here's what we have:\n\n1. Fetch - The input (from a user device like a keyboard or mouse) is sent through the input/ output (I/O) bus to the control unit. The control unit retrieves an instruction via the address bus from the memory (either RAM or ROM).\n\n2. Decode - The control unit \"decodes\" the instruction into commands that the ALU can understand and sends them to the ALU. The control unit also sends the input data to be processed to the ALU via the data bus.\n\n3. Execute - The ALU, with the use of registers (which act as small, temporary storage space), executes those commands on the given data and produces and sends output to the control unit via the data bus.\n\n4. Store - If the output needs to be stored, the control unit sends the output data back to the memory (RAM, in this case) via the address and data bus. The output data is also sent to a user device (like a monitor) via the I/O bus.\n\nA few questions: \n1. How does the control unit know which instruction it needs?\n2. What does the \"decoding\" process look like? The instruction from memory is in bytes, right? What form (or language) does the ALU need to understand the instruction?\n3. What sort of computation, if any, is performed by the ALU for basic functions (like typing)?\n4. In what situations would the output need to be stored?\n\nAny help would be appreciated. If we're off on any of this or if you have any great resources to help point us in the right direction, let us know! Thanks!",

I am a computer science senior at university, and will finish my undergrad next spring and finish Master's next spring. Obviously, this means preparing for and (hopefully) acquiring interviews are looming ahead. I had a question regarding projects to show employers. I know a it is common and helpful to work on side projects apart from school and contribute to open source. I have not done a lot of either. How will this affect me, if I have had previous internships, have good grades in the subject and can answer technical questions well? Also, I do have several projects that I have done for school that I am very proud of and would love to show an employer, but many of them use files and libraries that have high cost licenses and as such I had to run them on the school's cluster, not my personal computer. How would I go about trying to show these off to an employer? Sorry if  these questions sound naive.",

All right I'm not a senior software developer with 30+ years experience but I know how to copy a text... Also every example we solve in Programming Language class is super easy. They show algorithms in first 6 week and it's been 1 month since we started to C Language, still our associate professor show us the basic printf-scanf functions...\n\nI ain't learning anything.

Each data splice would have a packet marker that would allow a merge sort to maintain their context relative to other data, allowing for the HMM to increasingly make sense of context per merge.

        "text": "So more than two decades ago, I was a camper at a summer camp where we learned to program.  There was this game we had that, if you were good enough at it, you could play.  Essentially, you wrote the \"software\" to control a little \"robot\" on the screen, and it they fought each other.  The \"robots\" looked more like tanks.\n\nThis is what I remember about it:\n\nThe language was BASIC-ey.  You had only a handful of things you could do...drive forwards, drive backwards, rotate (either direction) the radar, gun, or body of the tank, \"ping\" with the radar (which would give you distance if it came back), and fire the gun.\n\nEach of the parts rotated at different speeds, with the radar being the fastest, and the body being the slowest...this was where a lot of the strategy came in, or at least what I remember spending the most time on.  You could turn the \"radar\" which was how you located your enemies, the gun, and the body of the tank independently, or you could lock any two (or all three) of them together, but they rotated at the slowest speed of whatever was locked together.  Basically, if you locked your gun and radar together, you could fire as soon as you got a ping back, but when you rotated them searching for enemies, both the radard and gun would rotate at the gun speed, which was slower than the radar could move.\n\nThe software supported a compile-like feature...evidently there were contests (how big, I don't know)...so that you could send your robot to someone but they couldn't see the source.  It came with, what was apparently the champion of one of these contests called \"R2D2\", that was VERY well written...in fact, that was the metric everybody compared their code too...how well it fared against R2D2.\n\nIt was otherwise very simple.  The graphics were not great; it had an editor and the arena and that's about it.\n\nI have no idea what this program was called, and I've on and off looked for it on the internet for the better part of the last 10 years with no luck.  Robocode looks a lot like it (perhapse with graphics improvements), but it was definitely not in java, and this was around 1995 or so the last time I played it.\n\nI would reward anybody who can help me find it.  The camp was called National Computer Camps (NCC) and was located in Connecticut.  I have considered getting in contact with the Camp, but about my 3rd or 4th year I want as a Counselor, I left on bad terms.",
