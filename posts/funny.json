[{"title":"Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.","author":"funny_mod","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/funny\/comments\/uq9pjw\/going_forward_comics_may_only_be_posted_on\/","text":"Hey there, folks!\n\nAs you're probably aware, there are quite a few very talented, very funny artists who offer their comics in \/r\/Funny... but there are also a growing number of \"comics\" here that are little more than low-effort ways of bypassing Rule 9. Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns\u00b9 that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.\n\nBasically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the \"Ennui Engine,\" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in \/r\/Funny.\n\nTo address this, we're going to experiment with a new approach:\n\nGoing forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), and only by the people creating them.\u00b2\n\nOur hopes with this are is twofold: \n\n1. By limiting \"comic days\" to two days a week, other original content will get the chance that it deserves. \n\n2. Wednesdays and Sundays will come to highlight \u2013 with the help of discerning voters, of course \u2013 the best comics submitted to the subreddit.\u00b3 \n\nThose of you who have had nothing better to do than [read our rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/funny\/wiki\/rules) and stay up to date on all of our announcements will know that we aren't *really* changing much, but even so, we wanted to mention the update, explain the reasons behind it, and give folks the chance to discuss\u2074 everything.\n\nWe'll be trialing this over the next few weeks, and we may end up adjusting things\u2075 slightly. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to share them here... and thank you, as always, for subscribing to \/r\/Funny!\n\n------\n\n^(\u00b9 These concerns have ranged from eloquent critiques to \"BLARGH BAD COMICS BAD!\")\n\n^(\u00b2 That is to say, comics may only be posted by the people creating the comics. We're not sure who creates Wednesdays and Sundays.)\n\n^(\u00b3 We thought about \"Comic Deathmatch Days\" as a label, but we didn't want comedians to get startled and start attacking each other.)\n\n^(\u2074 No doubt these discussions will be well-informed and well-thought-out, and definitely not text-based screaming matches.)\n\n^(\u2075 This turn of phrase wouldn't have sounded naughty without this footnote.)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1652632131.0},{"title":"Subreddit of the Month [March 2023] r\/ScenesFromAHat\/.
