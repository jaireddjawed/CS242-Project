        "text": "Roguelikes have always been a weird genre to me, when I first heard that when you die you start over, I was super skeptical about them. My first real experience was with the first Binding of Isaac, I just couldn't for the life of me understand what people liked about this game. To me it was a weird, gory Zelda 1 ripoff with permadeath, with nothing else to it. I put it down and never played another Isaac game ever again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward many years when a lot of critically acclaimed roguelikes was coming out and the first one I tried was Dead Cells. I ended up loving Dead Cells because I was huge Soulsborne fan at that point and Dead Cells took a lot of what I considered the best elements of both the original Dark Souls (weapon variety) and Bloodborne (fast combat with health regain). It was brutal, but I powered through and it took me 70 hours before I finished my first run, and I *liked* it, because no matter how difficult a situation was, it was always entirely *my fault* for losing. Another really good one was Risk of Rain 2, it had a god tier soundtrack and a selection of characters that all played very differently from one another, I bought it not long after it entered early access and only managed to finish a run a few weeks ago. Then I got Hades on the Switch and it amazed me how it managed to create a compelling story in a game where you basically die over and over. It took me about 60 runs to get to the credits and I read up later that on average it took people 30 runs to beat Hades, so that confirmed something I suspected for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI *sucked* at roguelikes, big time, and I felt bad about it. Typically I'm fairly decent at most genres, be it RPG's, RTS, Platformers, Rhythm games. But every roguelike I touched, destroyed me again and again and I always just thought that was how it was, and yes roguelikes ARE brutal. But recently it dawned on me that part of the reason it's hard to me is because of how I personally view the genre itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo many times I've found myself starting a run, picking up a few upgrades and already envisioning a build of what my character was to become towards the end of the run. *This was my fatal flaw,* **I was playing a roguelike as if it was an RPG***.* For example I'd pick up a powerful AOE attack that absolutely decimates crowds of enemies and think to myself \"this is the run\", I'd pick up upgrades that contributed to that AOE attack and nothing else, only to eventually fight a boss monster and get decimated myself because the entire run I've done nothing to actually counter powerful single entity enemies, oops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo every experience I had with a roguelike was basically me bashing my head against a wall over and over again until I *finally* was lucky enough to end up with a build that was in line with what I wanted, and half of the time I'd still lose. Then I played Against the Storm, it ended up being a roguelite city builder of all things that made me actually *get* the genre, because in this game so many different resources are being juggled around that you *have* to be considerate when choosing the right option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt made me realize that roguelikes are actually about testing your adaptability more than anything else. You can have the most specialized ludicrously powerful build possible but it can *always* be countered by something the game can throw at you. Every time you make a choice you have to pull back from what you want your build to be and take everything you know about your survival into consideration. So you have to play it safe and only through playing it safe can you eventually get the insane damage dealing juggernaut, just not the exact one you initially imagined.",

        "text": "As a quick test, think of some games which doesn't take place in either \n\nA: Fantasy land\n\nB: A Sci-Fi setting\n\nC: A fictional country\n\nD: A fictional town\n\nE: World war 2\n\nWhile games that do exist, they are vanishingly small, and frequently there are games which despite making obvious references to the real world still take place in some made-up country. Modern Warfare either take place in \"Unnamed Arab Country\" or \"Urzikstan\", Far Cry 2 in \"UAC\", Far Cry 3 I'm not even sure where it's even supposed to take place, Far Cry 4 in not-Nepal. Paper's Please takes place in \"Arstotzka\", Life is Strange despite clearly being Oregon still felt the need to completely make a town up from nothing. *Condemned* for some reason takes place in a fictional city, same with *This War of Mine.* I can understand it in cases like Silent Hill, but does it need to be almost *every* game?\n\nOther games which do take place in the real world lack real world markers. *Rise of the Tomb Raider* despite taking place \"somewhere in Siberia\" have barely any Russian or actually culturally Siberian characters to speak of. In the first Reboot game there's alsoa strange lack of stranded Japanese sailors, despite taking place on an island off the coast in Japan. *Alpha Protocol* goes the extra mile of having at least around 50 % Russian characters in Moscow, however Rome is completely populated by Americans. Deus Ex 1 is good at having its settings informed by the real world, but in *Invisible War* there's barely a single Arab in Cairo. *Human Revolution* even takes place in an unrecognizable Detroit and a completely fictional Chinese City.\n\nThis also extends to dialogue. Part of the reason might be that game characters rarely talk like actual people, but I can't barely think of game characters which even reference actual events, organizations or concepts. Again Deus Ex does it a bunch referencing FEMA, United Nations, The European Union, Rockefellers, Self employment rate etc. Which is such a rarity that Deus Ex has the reputation of \"that game that references actual politics\", like it's actually the only one to do it. \n\nThere are games like *Life is Strange 2* which has an obvious evil Trump-voter stand-in, who even references \"Build that wall\", but the game itself never actually references Trump, the Republican party or even having \"Make America Great Again\" written on red caps, leading to these stand-ins which feel more like the writers talking directly to us, rather than talking about real events. You want to talk about immigration policy, but can't even name Trump because...it would offend people?\n\nWhy I care about this at all is because there's a richness and wealth in setting stories in real world locations that I feel is being squandered. *Spec Ops: The Line* despite having a pretty bizarre idea about how sandstorms work still gains thematically by setting itself in *Dubai*, a symbol of consumerism and oil-politics. The history of *Chernobyl* lends a strong air of real world mystique to the setting of *Stalker, Fallout 3* can make incisive references to Americana and the nations culture by setting itself in the capital, *Bioshock: Infinite* tapping into the real world massacre at the Wounded Knee lends greater authenticity to the history of racism, moreso than if they would've invented some fictional massacre. There's nothing lost by setting Sleeping Dogs in actual Hong Kong rather than not-Hong Kong, and I would argue a big part of Deus Ex's staying power with its writing is that despite how silly it can be, it benefits from talking about complicated real world concepts, rather than simplistic fictional made-up concepts invented and resolved in the same entry. \n\nThe problems with using these fictional stand-ins is that they quickly can run out of control and lead you to saying things you don't want to say. *Mankind Divided*'s idea of supplanting actual racism with augmentation-based discrimination leads to unfortunate implications when the reason augmented people are discriminated against is because they actually every single one of them went kill crazy. Similarily in Dragon Age the discriminated mages are *actually* constantly in danger of being possessed by demons. The application to the real world starts falling apart here. If you want to discuss racism, just discuss racism, people are smart enough to see through your shallow allegories, but most people are also smart enough to generally take it seriously if you take it seriously. If you don't want to talk about serious issues that's fine to, but that doesn't mean you have to completely invent a world to do that.",

        "author": "Treshcore",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yyn6z3/completely_random_outcomes_independent_from_your/",
        "text": "All of us love games with different endings. Well, not all, but most. This is why we have them in different genres, should it be open world like GTA, immersive sim games like Deus Ex or Dishonored, interactive movies (or how else can I call it?) like Heavy Rain or Life is Strange and role-playing games like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Dragon Age and so on. Different endings can appear both in main quests or in side quests. People love it, and in really big games it's even sad when we have only one pre-determenied ending.\n\nHowever, all of them are based on our choices. **What is \"our choice\"? Basically, it's a combination of chemical processes happening in our mind and making us think and act in some way.** Sometimes it's even based on how you slept and what you ate this morning. Even when you're making a choice in a video game, you may choose one option today and choose another next week.\n\nThe problem of video games is that they usually track only what YOU did. **They give you outcomes and endings based on your choices... but when it comes to non-playable characters, they're very constant and dependent on your actions.** However, if other characters are not programmed robots, they should have their own head on their shoulders - and they have... But kind of don't use it. This makes replaying games, especially old games, quite boring from a story-telling point of view.\n\nThe biggest example of it that flows in my mind is \"Lights Out!\" quest in Solitude, Skyrim. This quest is absolutely linear, and when you start it not for the first time, you already know that &gt;!Jaree-Ra will betray you - without even double-thinking it!&lt; (yes, I put a spoiler for eleven years old game). I mean, he's a living person too, and he could at least discuss it with his bandits because, well, you're not just some random idiot, and all of them could give different outcomes based on their mood. So it applies to the many quests in Skyrim... But I guess even Bethesda didn't expect for it to be the latest TES game (excluding TESO) for over a decade to create such a comprehensive system.\n\nIt would be even more valuable, however, for completely story-driven games. Despite telling of examples which straightforwardly made certain NPCs actions based on your and only your actions (like Life is Strange or maybe Mass Effect), I know at least one game which did it right. It's Blade Runner, and I wish to play it some day just because of this line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)):\n\n&gt;Which characters are replicants is randomized each time a new game is started.\n\nSaw it? Every time you start a new game, you have to guess who is who, and even though I don't know how impactful it is for the story of the game, I think it's great from replayability point of view.\n\nWe're living in an era when video games reached the same level of narrative as movies. However, even a plot is a gameplay feature. **While action-oriented games may have randomized positions for enemies, plots may also have randomized actions performed by different characters, so it would make every of your playthroughs unique, will make you think.** Finishing my quite spontaneous post, I'd like you to express your opinion on every new playthrough being a completely unexpected experience and share more modern examples of games like this - because I believe that this approach isn't very new and I simply wonder how it was welcomed if it was used in more AAA games.",

        "text": "I think its very peculiar that there is no option to have random enemy placements in stealth games sometimes. Because 1 of my gripes with 'Pro Stealth Gameplay' is usually planning. Which is perfect and very immersive. Yet it breaches a certain boundary that actually makes it Completely immersion breaking. You are not planning on the fly after looking at level designs and enemy pathway patterns. You simply play the mission WITH knowledge that is only obtainable from having already explored the mission and finishing it beforehand.\n\nThat concept might be such a wierd thing to have a gripe with but its a just small one. Missions aren't done out of true first time planning and intelligence. More likely you went that way because you know the enemy wont be here until later, you used this door because you know its a secret entrance from previous playthroughs, you know the password from before, etc. Nothing came from truly analysing and planning like your 1st playthrough. But if you were to imagine yourself as the player in the game you somewhat break the 4th wall and have this godlike future know ledge of maps and enemies.\n\nI think it would be really beneficial to have the option of switched enemy placements, Switched entrances maybe, Passwords are handled well in dishonored (Its created specifically for you in that specific playthrough so you actually have to find it). You might say that this just creates a whole different map and i disagree. Its slight changes that require planning and analysis but the very structure of the map is mostly the same. Think of it like instead of entering the building from the 1st floor window only the 3rd floor window is open, Instead of cameras now they have lasers or sensors, stuff like that.",

And yea I had fun with it, was nice, the game had some grand vistas that I expect from a fantasy epic and there were some cool moments but otherwise, I felt that I had already played this game a thousand times.\n\nI've been gaming since the early 90s and I've played countless \"Elden Rings\" since then to the point that this game just isn't that interesting. Yea, it was fun, like a marvel movie is fun but nothing I have never seen before. I can say the same thing about most of those other nominees there as well. Btw, I do think Elden Ring will win because it's very popular, if you wanted my opinion on that.\n\nI think gaming has just lost it's appeal to me, gaming has changed and evolved in a way that no longer appeals to me, I don't watch gaming channels anymore except for one nor do I care about gaming reviews or anything else anymore. Since I might buy at the most one game a year at this point.\n\nI still play games, but mostly old games, but I really see myself maybe one day stop playing games completely, as eventually I'll get tired playing these old games over and over and with the lack of any real interest in gaming, I will probably move on. And ofcourse getting other newer interests have pretty much replaced most of my gaming time as well, which hasn't bothered me.\n\nYeah, not sure on the point of the thread but just wanted to talk with other people about this and not just with the usual suspects such as friends and family.",

        "text": "This is quite a short question but what I mean is how much does God of War 2018 and R's \"unbroken narrative\", that is to say the fact that the camera \"never cuts\" and is filmed in a \"one shot\" style, really matter? Because while it is certainly a commendable effort, the player will constantly be ripped out of this illusion whenever they open the pause menu to change equipment or look at the map. Not to mention dying or, hell, the game being long enough that the player will turn it off and turn it back on again many many times. \n\nDunno but just kinda thought of this after finished Ragnarok. I must've opened the equipment and map screen, i dunno, maybe 200, 300 or hell maybe even 400 times. What with checking the map, checking the lore scrolls and codes, changing equipment, swapping Rage styles.  \n\nOther games have done this. Dead Space comes to mind. In that game however all the menuing was done in the context of the game, the inventory is a holographic display that Isaac physically brings up. So the illusion isn't broken there because it's still in the world. The health bar and stasis are better implemented but that's a different conversation. \n\nMGSV for the most parts attempts this but travelling from Mother Base to wherever triggers a loading screen but again all the menuing is done in the world through a holographic display. \n\nSo yes it is cool that theoretically you could sit down and, if you never open the menu or pause the game or die, play the entire game and the camera will never cut away, but let's face it that'll never happen. \n\nI don't even really mean is it a worthwhile in that maybe you couldn't do any cool shots (because they do) or transitions if the camera is mainly focused on Kratos's right shoulder. But was it a worthwhile effort if it can't really be experienced properly by anyone? Because yeah sure you could probably play for like an hour straight without the camera cutting if you never change equipment or check the map etc but most people will never do that. It's an RPG (kinda) so you're gonna be changing and upgrading your stuff pretty often. \n\nThis isn't a movie where maybe it's like 2 hours long and you will be able to experience the narrative as the unbroken direction as it was intended. This is like a 20 30 40 hour video game where that reality is simply impossible. \n\nSo do you think there's value in it?",

At no point throughout this game did I feel powerful controlling Kratos. From the beginning of the game to late game I felt the same. A regular mob still posed a challenge (health/def sponge). I had most skills unlocked, armor set to level 7, weapons at 6, increased health/rage and I still felt weak where enemies drop you in a few hits.\n\nWhere is the brutality from past God of Wars gone? Why do enemies vanish like fucking paper mache after killing? Why does the level design feel like a walled garden? I think Atreus was more powerful than Kratos which makes no sense to me. \n\nDoes anyone else share similar views?",

        "text": " Went into this game with high hopes and would watch the trailers daily since I was extremely hyped to see this game drop - however it fell short for me compared to its predecessor which I feel is the more superior game, God of War 2018(2018). Just care for spoilers ahead if you haven't finished already. Starting off a bit tame with the first point.\n\nI'll start with the combat first. When swinging the axe against an enemy for the first time in Ragnarok I noticed something was very off; I feel it ultimately boils down to how the character animation reads. In 2018 whether it was the Leviathan Axe (LA) or the Blades of Chaos (BoC) there was always a sense of weight whenever Kratos swung his weapons and upon connecting blows with an enemy there was resistance that you could easily read on both Kratos and said enemy. The only time in Ragnarok where I felt that same level of weight and resistance was when you hit a fully charged R2 with the LA. That doesn't mean I thought the combat was terrible by any means; Ragnarok definitely improved upon how you'd go about chaining different weapon attacks/abilities and with the addition of the Draupnir Spear (DS) and mod tokens, it opened up another avenue for players to take in regards to combat which I thought was awesome. (Not a complete deal-breaker but I was a bit saddened that the series of attacks you'd get with the LA by holding R1 in 2018 was removed.) \n\nThe scale and scope of the world/realms was a lot larger this time around since everything was going to be open for us to explore; this got me super excited since I loved how much depth and care it took to create Midgard in 2018, with the different biomes and branching paths which stemmed from Tyr's temple. Having that level of creativity transposed onto the other realms in Ragnarok I thought would lead to an experience I could immerse myself in but unfortunately I could never fully lose myself in the fantasy Santa Monica Studios was trying to create. I don't mean to be harsh with these coming comments and I'm in no position to professionally critique world/level design in games but again I will use 2018 as a mode of reference when it comes to this topic. In 2018, Midgard was used as the central realm from which our adventures would branch from and return to. Having that hubworld you would always come back to was something that resonated with me which in turn would get me attached to the world itself - also the world was very stunning. In Ragnarok, due to the narrative this has been relegated to Sindri's House due to Fimbulwinter and the dangers of which it brings as well as Odin. The issue I see here is that we never get attached to \"Sindri's house\", we only go back if the narrative demands it but we never spend any more than one cinematic at a time there and then we're off. The argument can be made that our attachment is to those at the house, most notably Brok and Sindri which is a very valid point. Not relating to world design but Sindris character was further explored in Ragnarok which I enjoyed, but Broks character was kind of left behind in the previous game. I want to break down when you pull something like that near the end of Ragnarok (you know what).\n\nBack on topic but In 2018, looking out across the Lake of Nine you can see just how vast the world is, making you the player feel very small. And I know thats unfair to say since in Ragnarok, Midgard has been ravaged by snow but not once throughout the entirety of the game and in all the realms had I felt that level of vastness. Speaking about all realms here but everything in Ragnarok felt very close and in regards to the world/level design made it feel very dungeon-like - even realms like Svartalfheim and Vanaheim (and yes the huge arid biome as well). Experiencing these realms felt like I was always on tracks, only deviating from the path for a chest which had hacksilver or some other miscellaneous item. Exploring these new realms felt like more of a chore than anything else, and the atmosphere that was created in the realms of 2018 (maybe not Niflheim) made traversing those realms a lot more enjoyable. \n\nAtmosphere and scale was implemented superbly in 2018, a place that comes to mind although it might not be a first choice when thinking about these two things, is when you reach the Heart of the Mountain and the events leading from there. Although its in an enclosed space, that sense of scale is still prominent and the level design itself is sensible and appropriate to sell the atmosphere of a once functioning mine. The place is massive and as the player you feel the strides of traversing from the heart, all the way to the summit - the views at the top were really breathtaking too. Also you fight a dragon along the way which totally caught me off guard on a first play-through which was very exhilarating - also you get a great and well deserved unlock upon slaying the dragon. Another place worth mentioning from 2018 is Alfheim and the areas within and surrounding the Temple of Light; the grand reveal upon seeing the structures was really magical. The temple-like space under the waters and the temple itself held some very interesting set pieces and was somewhat glad to see them making a return in Ragnarok - although the atmosphere in Ragnarok feels very lifeless (maybe that was intended).  Although there are plenty more locales I could touch upon from 2018, for me personally, even though Ragnarok boasts large realms for players to explore, they lack the substance that made 2018 more immersive and likable.\n\nAnd now onto the narrative, I have very mixed feelings on the direction of Ragnarok. It picks up very sensibly from the events of 2018, and starting in a similar fashion with a high stakes battle between Kratos and Thor. From there, Kratos and Atreus must traverse the nine realms either together or with other allies to bring about 'Ragnarok' and end Odin's reign - very brief and not entirely true for the first half of the game since Kratos doesn't seek war against Asgard. Side note but the portrayals of both Odin and Thor I thought were phenomenal throughout the game, props to the acting and writing that went behind them. Also Christopher Judge gave one of the best video game performances ever in this one and deserves all the praise he has been getting for this role.  \n\nSince a considerable amount of time has passed within the world from 2018 to Ragnarok we are able to see much of Kratos' humanity return to him throughout the story and I really enjoyed his insights on matters between other characters which I always thought were accurate and appropriate. I didn't have any qualms with the Atreus gameplay and I do agree that the level with Angrboda was a bit drawn out; Atreus' story was one I was relatively interested in, especially when it came to Asgard. The story beats from Ragnarok aren't as memorable as the ones in 2018 and suffice to say, I've already forgotten some bits of the story even though I completed the game two days ago. The addition of these new characters was cool and refreshing to witness their stories, however I was partly irked at how Brok was handled in this game. We find out quite early that Sindri has been accompanying Atreus on adventures behind Kratos' back which would have been very out of character for him in 2018. Seeing this was great since it shows how he has developed as a character from the frail and always hygienic dwarf, to one that is more confident and outgoing. We learn more about him as a character and a dark secret which he wishes to keep from his brother. Brok on the other hand, we barely spend any notable time with him - the only thing that comes to mind was when he accompanied Kratos to retrieve the spear. In 2018 the constant feud between Brok and Sindri was always entertaining and there was a sense of relief from seeing them since they'd always make some remark about the others handiwork and improve upon the axe within a cinematic. Along with being super helpful, they are among one of my favourite side characters in all of gaming and ones that I grew very attached to whilst playing 2018. Sadly that attachment wasn't re-invigorated as much for Brok in this one, which made his death near the end not impact me as much - although him defending Atreus' honor just before his demise was one that almost got the tears welling.\n\nGoing back to that point about story beats, the manner and execution of some of the events in Ragnarok felt quite off. At times the main quests were no different to the favours that I would come across - and would involve very repetitive steps for the player to take. Progression in Ragnarok didnt feel as rewarding as 2018, most notably when it came to level traversal and unlocks. In both games you would have certain obstacles that presented themselves - some of which you wont be able to overcome until you unlock a certain key ability. In 2018 you had to slay a dragon, bring down a giant hammer shortly followed by fighting Magni and Modi, traverse through Alfheim and cleanse it along with a couple more to unlock key abilities. Whereas in Ragnarok, Freya augments your chisel freely, you retrieve the moon for Hati, and give a ring to the Lady. Nothing feels earned and these unlocks are given to Kratos on a silver plate. These next ones are more of minor peeves. I was annoyed at how Skol and Hati were relegated to an ingame mechanic to change time of day to open different paths. In the trailer it is made out as if this is a major plot point that sets certain events in motion but nope. I might have missed some dialogue but I didn't see Atreus tell Sif that Thrud would make a good valkyrie.   \n\nThe ending of the game is one I wasn't too impressed with. Yes it had Endgame vibes when Kratos and Freya is hyping up the incoming battle but seeing the battles resolution I was left disappointed. I know there was a change of heart when it came to the actual 'Ragnarok' after seeing the Midgardians in the frontlines, but it felt pointless in the end. Surtr was a bit of a letdown and even going to his realm to get his help was underwhelming although the Valkyries fight was refreshing (Valkyries &gt; Undead Knight things in Ragnarok). When Freyr sacrificed himself I saw that as another Titanic Jack and Rose situation. The buildup of the mask and the knowledge that rip in space contains was just that, 'buildups', the way in which they handled that was very safe - not to say I want to see whats actually in that tear but at least insinuate that the existence of such things isn't easily squashed because Atreus breaks the mask, maybe I'm missing something. The emotions thrown around during and after the last Thor fight was great, however the Odin fight left much to be desired. I expected more than what we got, being All Knowing and all why didn't he have a gimmick like Heimdall? Thought that was quite a cool fight in hindsight. I know the challenging fights are often reserved for optional content, but Odin himself wasn't challenging at all which is a shame since his restraint which is evident throughout the game could have made for a very brutal end game fight.\n\nWhen thinking about 2018 the narrative for that was sound and engaging and I didn't feel that as much in Ragnarok. In 2018 the constant figurative and literal climb experienced by Kratos and Atreus was one I was fully invested in, moments like encountering Baldur at the start, seeing Freyas home, meeting Jormungandr for the first time, traversing Helheim atop a floating ship, fighting Svartaljofurr, retrieving the Blades of Chaos, taking on the challenge of the Valkyries, and reaching the highest peak in Jotunheim. Those moments will stick with me and would give me goosebumps when experiencing them, I can't say the same for Ragnarok to the same amount of reverence. One portion in Ragnarok that did give me chills was when Kratos, Mimir and Freya sought audience with the Norns. That bit to me held a sense of presence and mystery and expanded upon the world inadvertently - whether it is Greek or Norse mythology there is existential constants which their realities abide by. This moment felt very God of War to me. \n\nI must admit the resolution to Ragnarok was very touching, seeing Kratos and Atreus part ways along with seeing Kratos's heartfelt reaction to the mural of him being worshiped - I don't see how this game is being considered a masterpiece and leagues above its predecessor. Sorry for being quite sloppy near the end with my reasoning - tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: Combat didn't feel as weighty, world/realms were big but lacked the substance that made God of War 2018 memorable, Brok story arc non-existent, progression didn't feel earned, story beats missed their mark, ending was disappointing.",

        "text": "You know... I love cinematographic, realistic, story-oriented and visually outstanding seventh generation games. Also, I love Sony for preserving their spirit. These guys do everything to impress players, to give them the quality of a true PlayStation game. **They're great... But personally, I'm tired of them being on the same level as other games.**\n\nThough many years, Sony uses a simple formula: create smooth graphics with effects, make a game look like a movie with camera angles and lesser HUD, create smooth gameplay, add plot with some social message or deep characters... and create a hype around it. Usually, they don't change this formula because that's what people love. They tried to be experimental with Days Gone and Ghost of Tsushima, but these games were not as successful as games of that formula. **However, the games which utilize it are automatically labeled as possible Games of The Year - and so it is with Horizon: Forbidden West and especially God of War: Ragnarok.**\n\nPersonally, I'm feeling very sad for some other good games of 2022. They're not flawless, but at least they're unique even in what they're doing not good. For example:\n\n* **Dying Light 2.** Not perfect, and I don't like zombies, but was it bad? No: many people played and play it.\n* **Ghostwire: Tokyo.** Checked this one today, and even though I understand that it has it's flaws, it's still a visually-impressive game about horrors of the unique Japanese culture.\n* **Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.** Another interesting RPG game, with character creation and multiplayer.\n* **Weird West.** Don't know much about this one, but it's story-oriented, has unique graphical style, interesting characters - I would play it some day.\n* **Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.** I don't really like Mario, but for someone, it's a big release as well.\n* **Sonic Frontiers.** Despite initial criticism, it appeared to be really good. Some may say that it's released too late for TGA... **But wait, isn't GOWR released on the same day?**\n* **TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.** I'm not a big fan of pixel art games, 1987 Turtles and whole 80's nostalgia thing, but it would've been not objective for me to not to include them.\n* **Sifu.** Maybe a minimalistic game, but it has so many funny mods, so I think that it's the game of the year for many people.\n* **Bayonetta 3.** Another great game by Platinum Games, what else can I say?\n* **Gran Turismo 7.** Who said a racing game can't be nominated?\n* **Total War: Warhammer III.** Who said a strategy game can't be nominated?\n\nI agree with Elden Ring, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Stray and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 - all of them are either unique or trying to be like Sony games, but can't beat them due to not having \"Sony\" as a loud trademark near their name, but having less money for all this cinematography and details. \n\nAlso, this year's games are The Callisto Protocol, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Need for Speed: Unbound and, of course, Goat Simulator 3. However, they're not released yet, and that's why I have a question for The Game Awards in particular. A few actually. \n\n* Why are you in such a hurry? Aren't mentioned games less 2022 than the ones you nominated? \n* Why have you decided to start a this voting in less than a week after GOWR release, before all hype goes away?\n* Didn't you overlook Sonic Frontiers? It's released on the same day as GOWR, but has no nominations despite having good reviews. Why do you put GOWR so easily just after a week, but ignore Sonic Frontiers? \n\nI don't expect them to be properly answered though. Let's get back to the topic. \n\n**I think that Sony games should be given an \"Outstanding\" award for being anticipated and living up to this anticipation, yet not offering something really unique.** I don't have PS4 or PS5 and maybe it makes my opinion less valuable, but from what I see, all their biggest games like Uncharted, God of War, Horizon or The Last of Us look the same, maybe felt the same, discussed as \"serious stories with deep characters\". Obviously, they are Games of The Year... because they were initially made like that: with the highest quality, with lots of money, with greatest development process organization, in a normal pace without crunches or lollygagging. \n\nThis is why other games should have bigger attention. They're not perfect, but they're created mostly \"as is\". Nobody's giving them additional couple of years of development, everyone's expecting results from them, so they just release it and hope for the best. Usually, these games are released pretty good, but they become sold pretty poorly and forgotten pretty fast. **Game awards' nominations could've been an additional promotion for these games, and some of them winning may be a lesson to everyone else that they can fight and can win by just being good and original - not perfect in every aspect and not anticipated by almost anyone just because of rich promotional campaign.**  \n\nI don't expect this post to be highly supported, but I don't want every game awards ceremony of 2022 to become a God of War: Ragnarok celebration party.

But then MW2 had a scene where you gun down helpless civilians in an airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is going too far in games? And does it matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially I was offended, because I thought it was tasteless, but then I thought, \"is there a way to make it tasteful?\" But I thought about it even more, and that \"tasteful\" perspective felt shallow. Even if you made a Diary of Anne Frank game; with the same production value of Heavy Rain, where it's meant to show you what it was like it hiding from Nazis. Would that get a pass? It's an art game and art games are meant to push boundaries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if you made \"[Maus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus)\" into an action stealth game with graphic novel elements, and the game was actually really fun? Like you had branching dialogue options, social links, and the source material was fully realized in game form. Does that excuse it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the game is good, but offensive, does it get a pass? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game Cost of Freedom gives off the impression of Dead By Daylight, you would play as an SS officer chasing down prisoners. Or you could play as a prisoner and try to escape. It's an interesting idea, and I think there's alot of potential for interesting gameplay. They could have taken it step further and made a full day in the life of a Nazi simulator. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut me saying that puts a sour taste in my mouth. I guess you could skirt that line by just making it fanatasy WWII era like Valkyria Chronicles, but I think there's merits to showing actual nazis. This game [was canceled](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ukraine-developers-forced-to-scrap-auschwitz-themed-video-game-after-outcry/), so ultimately no one will be able to judge it's quality or artistic merits, and I don't know if that's a good thing or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is why I'm asking the question and see how others feel about the limits for artistic expression. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think games should be canceled for being too offensive? I think a game should be finished and judged as a final product and shouldn't be scrapped during production. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the devs should have had some foresight and figured it was going to be canceled, but was it right to cancel them?",

Most major releases have elements of action/RPG/adventure altogether, the boundaries of genre are harder to define now. You end up in a situation where Elden Ring is competing for the best RPG with other JRPG titles like Xenoblade and Pokemon instead of competing for the best action game. Also, some genres have very limited releases in a year which makes the award itself pretty awkward. \n\nAnd for the awards that are directly related to the released game, they more or less suffer from similar problems. There is an award for best video game adaptation when there are barely 5 video game adaptations in a year. Comparing esports teams from different games is also quite meaningless.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yv58wc/i_feel_like_im_going_crazy_seeing_all_this_praise/",
        "text": "To preface: I thoroughly enjoyed GoW 2018 and consider it a great game. Although I have my issues with it (namely how it incorporates homogenized gameplay mechanics which plagues so many AAA games today), it was a complete game with a well-paced story and a highly likeable father-son dynamic. If I had to pick a single game to recommend to anyone it would be GoW 2018, because I know for a fact there’s something in it for everyone to enjoy. That is a huge accomplishment in my eyes and I can’t say the same for most games.\n\nThat being said, I am roughly 12+ hours into Ragnarok, having done all the side content while progressing the main story, and I have to say I do not enjoy playing this game at all. I have so many problems with the sequel that I was ready to put it down a couple of hours in but decided against it to see if it would improve (it doesn’t).\n\nI need to mention that I have nothing but respect for the developers and am happy that millions of people around the world are enjoying the game. I have no issue with the popularity and commercial success of the game, but I’m just completely baffled at its reception.\n\nI’d like to apologize about the post title. It might appear a bit click-baity but that’s how I genuinely feel after seeing universal praise and non-stop 10s. I’ve seen debate about whether this is the greatest game of all time. I’ve read reviews that called it a masterpiece. The only mixed review I encountered was from IGN Korea, who gave it a 6/10 - the reviewer was subsequently sent multiple death threats from people who disagreed with his take.\n\nAll this being said, I think it’s worth stating some of the many problems with this game:\n\nGameplay: the game feels like a complete chore to play. Control is taken from you so frequently, and when it’s not, your character is constantly slowed to a halt and forced into a certain perspective. The puzzles are so unbelievably mindless and pose zero challenge. Despite how easy they are, your sidekicks are eager to shout out the solutions so quickly, sometimes only a few SECONDS after reaching the specific “puzzle” where you don’t even have the time to process what you need to be solving. I found NO way to turn these verbal hints off in the menu which doesn’t make sense considering the sheer amount of accessibility and difficulty-altering settings there are.\n\nCombat: the combat does not have any weight or satisfying feel to it. Hitting enemies with the Leviathan axe feels like slapping them with a wet towel. The camera is so far up Kratos’s ass that you have no visual clarity on what the hell is going on during fights. The indicators are a band-aid solution that do not address the problem at all, it only makes it a guessing game as to when attacks and projectiles are coming so you spam the dodge without being able to time anything in a reasonable sense. I understand this was an issue in the first game but it’s more prevalent here because of the higher number of projectiles that enemies throw at you. And even if so, it’s all the more reason to improve it considering it’s a sequel. Just zoom out the camera during fights, it’s really that simple.\n\nWriting: this has been said countless times already but it really does feel like a Disney / Marvel adventure movie. I personally don’t mind this narrative structure at all, in fact it would make sense in a story-driven game. But why is the quality of dialogue so god awful in this game? There are so many jarring, bizarre lines that do not fit the setting and universe. “My ex”, “Dumbass!”, “Yikes”, “Daddy”, I can go on and on. The characters will simply NOT shut up and bring up the same topic over and over again while you’re drudging through the main story and side content. Seriously these conversations have absolutely no depth to them and provide nothing of substance. Less is usually more in this case, but the developers seem to disagree. I don’t know if I’m alone with this, but the way these characters interact with eachother and what they say REALLY detracts from the experience to the point where it becomes difficult to take the story seriously.\n\nHardware: the game does not take advantage of the upgraded hardware at all, and as such the game still feels like a PS4 game first, with PS5 being an afterthought, even though the PS5 has been out for over 2 years now. In a world where Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart has provided a stellar showcase of what SSDs in consoles can achieve, it’s frankly embarrassing that we still have these climbing sections, tight walkways, and fast travels that take over a minute long. There was so much potential here if they had utilized the PS5. I understand that alienating the PS4 audience does not make sense from a financial perspective but the reality is that GoW: Ragnarok will be primarily played on the PS5 for many, MANY years to come. These useless sections do nothing but hamper gameplay as well this game’s longevity. \n\nThat’s a summary of my major gripes with the game. I have a multitude of other minor issues, mostly pet peeves and super-personal gripes, most of which are too nitpicky to mention. I hope this post spawns some discussion criticizing the game because most of what I’ve found in other subreddits are either downvoted heavily or outright deleted.",

        "text": "I am a huge fan of the Mafia series. I consider them one of the most well written, tightly crafted games in the past few decades easily. However there was always one thing about these games (particularly Mafia 2) that bothered people: For an open world franchise, there really wasn't much to see or do. Mafia 2 especially suffers from this. Aside from a few activities here and there there really isn't anything to do. So, for Mafia 3 the devs decided to change that. And boy did the change it...did they change it indeed \n\nMafia 3 prooved, at least in my eyes, once and for all that these games should've been linear stories with some free roaming instead of open worlds. Mafia 3 hurts me especially because the story is just so god damn good. The pacing, the voice acting, the facial animations, the atmosphere, the writing, the realistic way in which everything flows, the perfect capturing of late 60's Louisiana, and the fact that they managed to make the basic revenge story cliche feel fresh by just how well executed it was, everything about this game surrounding these aspects is flawless\n\nWhich is why it hurts oh so much when that great narrative and storytelling is shoved into the most boring, repetitive, monotness, cookie cutter open world gameplay i've ever seen. The open world of Mafia 3  (besides being gorgeous which is another thing i'll give it) literally feels like a template open world. It feels like a pre - alpha stage where the devs just shoved a bunch of expected activities that were supposed to be filled with something interesting but the intern spilled coffee on the machine or something and it got released like this",

        "text": "Now that the digital hardware trends have been leading us towards bigger and more power hungry devices that aren't quite built to last, even though we can do much better than that with the technology that we've come to now, I got an idea. Why aren't we bringing back the idea of gameboy, tamagotchi, or even LCD game watch into the 2020s?\n\nWhen I mention a gameboy like modern console, I think the first thing that comes to most people's mind are the Arduboy and Playdate. The Arduboy is a great product made of completely off the shelf parts, but unfortunately the maximum file size allowed for the games is measly 32KB, the amount of internal flash storage it has, and it's still not as cheap as I'd like. The Playdate has a disappointingly dim screen, high price, mediocre battery life, small and cramped buttons, and a crank control which I have a mixed feelings of. I think they're okay products, but I don't have much a reason to get them when handheld emulators exist, and my phone has better battery life and more games anyway. I think we can do better than this.\n\nSo last year, I came across [this thing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411839). The ENGAGE, a battery free gameboy emulator. It is an interesting concept, a gameboy emulator that never runs out of power, since it harnesses power from button presses. That sounds cool, but I'm questioning the feasibility of it, like turning buttons into power generator. Wouldn't such a thing have durability issue? Can we easily fix and replace them when they're worn out? And how could we build this thing at a cheap price? It sounds expensive.\n\nSo I looked into the technical stuff, and it caught my interest how the whole system only consumes 11.5mW of power, with the screen only consuming 0.3 mW. It's a reflective LTPS screen, which means it has no backlight and consumes very little power. With that much power efficiency, I think there's much to gain from making it non battery powered. You could put in a couple of AA alkaline batteries and they would power the console nonstop for a week. However I think we could do even better than that.\n\nWhat if we actually made a gameboy or wonderswan-like console with modern technology? By replacing the 32 bit MCU in that gameboy emulator with a modern low cost 16 bit PIC or Renesas MCU, we would achieve a maximum power consumption of 4.8 mW 3V at 8MHz. That would be a whopping 33 days with a single AA alkaline cell, or 65 days with two of them. Of course MCU wouldn't be the only thing the device needs, so I made a small list of the parts that would be included in it. Note that I'm not a computer expert or an electrical engineer hence I have little clue of what would be needed, but I did a little research, and this is what I came up with. \n\n* The 16-bit MCU, with as many pins as possible like 96 or 128, it would be the heart of the console. Renesas sells them for less than $1 in a bulk, probably even less if it's possible to replace the flash memory inside with a mask rom. That would make the MCU more reliable rugged also.\n* The screen, a low resolution reflective LTPS LCD screen with black and white screen to minimize the pins needed for the display, so we wouldn't need another MCU for that. I might be wrong here though. An alternative would be an STN LCD screen, it would be cheaper but the image would be less sharp and any movement might produce a ton of ghosting. I'm not sure where you could get either one of them for a low price, they're pretty rare nowadays, but they should be really cheap to manufacture.\n* The LED frontlight, since the screen is reflective, you gotta need to turn on that frontlight when you play in the dark. Sort of like the GBA SP.\n* The RAM, a Infineon 4Mbit 2.2V SRAM, my idea is to dump the entire game's data from an external flash storage into this low power RAM so that the console would consume very little power while running the game. SRAM also consumes very little power while dormant, which means the memory would be retained when the system is turned of. 512KB is more than enough for beefy black and white games. That would be around $2-3 in a bulk according to mouser. \n* 1 or 2 channel audio IC. It would sound like doorbells I guess, better than nothing.  \n* Bluetooth and 64MB flash storage module to transfer the game from a phone app. I'm thinking of a storefront app for community developed games you could send via bluetooth into this console. No piracy protection of course. \n* Mask ROM game cartridge, an alternative for the bluetooth and flash module. I think it would be nice to re-release the most popular games on cartridges, just like the nintendo switch carts, many would try to get their hands on it, and it wouldn't be quite as vulnerable to piracy or bit rotting. \n* 2 or 3 alkaline batteries to power the device. The first two battery would be essential to run the whole system, and the last one would only power the frontlight LED, bluetooth, and speakers, you could still play games without it. Those two batteries should have enough power for at least a month of constant operation while the last one should provide enough for 20-30 hours or so. \n* An optional crank power generator with a small ultracapacitor power storage unit, sold separately. Now you can play it forever without a single battery. \n* Simple plastic dome silicone buttons. The layout consists of two dpads on each side (great for twin stick shooters), two shoulder buttons on each side, and one start button. Having a dedicated switch to let the player seamlessly switch between left handed and right handed controls would be wonderful.   \n\nAnd that's the reason this handheld system would be really cheap and long, long lasting. 16 bit CPU, black and white screen, and no lithium battery. This is the kind of system that would survive the post apocalypse while offering more modern and better games than the original gameboy. A bulk of the games should be community made, and development tools (game engine, assembler, emulation software) would have to be provided for free, although the killer apps would be professionally made. With 512KB you could create action RPGs or Sim City clones, that's as much space as the biggest NES games and IBM 8086 PC games used.\n\nI don't know whether this is a brilliant idea or I'm just a delusional idiot, but I'm really fond of this idea of a cheap and rugged console that lasts a century. I have obsession with environmentally friendly products, electronics for the masses, and entertainment devices that could survive the collapse of a power grid or even the entire human civilisation. Sure brick game and tiger LCD are all of those, but who could play them for more than 3 minutes? And that's where the idea stems from. \n\nSo anyway, I thank anyone who wasted their precious time to read my poorly grammared and meandering essay lol, and I appreciate every valuable input.",

Too much contemporary words and tone deaf sentences that break immersion:\n- \"Geological differences\"\n- \"Sonic waves\"\n- Odin talking about his \"ex\"\n- Durlin asking to be allowed to finish playing the song because its so in \"tuuuuuune\" with the alarm\n\nThis does not match the serious tone the game started with in the first act. And the writing keeps going downhill:\n\n- Thor being upset about his sons being dead and then just forgives the \"blood debt\" \n- The bear cubs scene felt super forced\n\nAnd then the entire game just becomes a less fun Ratchet and Clank, but because it lacks zanyness it feels much more repetitive. In R&amp;C the map was truly open and easy to navigate and each map threw one or two totally new mechanics.\nIn Ragnarok the levels are fully on rails with very obvious secret chests that result in an eternal puzzle-gate-battle loop. I guess this is a separate topic.\n\nOn a different thread I read that they are trying to write it like a Marvel game, which does make sense but is truly dissapointing. The game sufferes from a huge identity crisis between serious epic tone and contemporary oneliners.",

Some dialogue felt a bit overly sentimental or pretty Marvel/Disney Channel-esque with how cringeworthy it is at times. Some moments can feel a bit contrived and poorly thought out. A certain character has a transformation at the end that felt way too over-the-top and edgy to me. It was hard to take seriously and it was pretty cringey at times.

Overall, I thought the story was good and even pretty heartwarming at times but I can't help but find some of it to be pretty disappointing. Any of you feel similar? Or am I just being a bit cynical?",

        "text": "The thing is I didn't really grow up gaming. Maybe it was because I was religious or financial issues or whatever. \n\nBut I remember when my dad bought a Wii one day which came with wii sports. It was so fun playing with my family and trying to beat them. Even though I was scared of the mii and the music for some odd reason I still fucking enjoyed it. \n\nAlso I remember playing all those cool flash games as well. Even though I wanted to play some other games, seeing all the creativity fleshed out in these fabulous pieces of art, I still wanted more. In a way, I've always been like that. I've always thought that being materialistic and owning tons of gaming devices meant you were cooler.\n\n\nOver the lockdown it was one of the worst times of my life as my mental health was going down the drain and had no one to talk to. I played some mobile games but it didn't help. Then after it ended I'd try to research about gaming as much as I could. My brother bought me a ps4 pro in late 2020 and I was pretty angry because I wanted an Xbox (most of my friends had one). I played a few games on it but as much as I played they'd eventually get boring. These games were mainly multiplayer oriented so that's probably the reason. Splitgate, Rocket League, Fortnite, Ark, Warzone and Apex ( I seldom played these ones though).\n\nOf course I've learned that I shouldn't care what my friends have after making some posts on reddit (which I deleted for some reason). They gave me tips to help me and some interesting responses. Also my friends have long forgotten and don't care what system I have. \n\n\nBut thats not the problem anymore. A few months ago I lost my controller. I can't even find my spare one. I keep seeing playthroughs and gaming videos but it doesn't help. Rather just increases my frustration and jealousy. And ignorance.\n\nAll I want to do is play games (with friends). But also experience why people love God of War or TES, Halo, Mass Effect, Mario, Zelda, The Witcher, Soulsborne, Final Fantasy, Asssasins Creed, Persona, Smash, Pokemon, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Red Dead Redemption, Portal, Half Life, GTA, Crash Bandicoot, Sonic etc\n\nI. Want. To. Experience. Something. At this point mainly singleplayer. But to play a game and feel satisfied. To feel connected to a character. To have fun with the game. I don't care about the graphics. I just want to have some fun with my life. Religion and whatnot hasn't helped me. And in some ways restricted my freedom. \n\nIf you have any recommendations or insightful advice regarding this post, I'm all ears.\n\n\nTLDR: I just want to play video games and experience the wonder of the medium. The joys of escapism and entering a new world, controlling everything with the press of a button on a controller. Please help me!!!!!!!!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yu639g/why_does_god_of_war_ragnarok_feel_like_a_disney/",
        "text": "I’ve been enjoying GoWR but some aspects of the level-design feel a bit... Off? I can only describe it as Disney theme park-like. \nAt first, I thought it was because of the abundant boat sections (there was that one sequence that was literally just Splash Mountain), but I realized that a lot of the “normal” gameplay moments have a similar vibe.\n\nI can’t narrow it down to one specific thing, but here are a few things that probably attribute to this. \n\nExtreme Visual Detail and Low Interaction: This game is definitely impressive when it comes to visuals. Almost every corner of the game is filled with hidden items and small creatures. But despite how much life is visually conveyed on-screen, it still feels kind of sterile. \n\nThis game has a TON of invisible walls. Entire rooms and areas are completely inaccessible and seem to have no purpose beyond adding visual flavor. In most instances, you can’t even drop down to a small platform until you’ve completed some arbitrary task. The game will also throw invisible walls around characters and objects in the middle of animation sequences. The general rule seems to be “look but don’t touch.”\n\nThis contributes to the Disney-theme park rideiness because a lot of those attractions work in a similar way. You have a fixed path to move, and while there may be a lot of cool animatronics and characters in the background, you can’t directly interact with them. It’s fun in real life, but in a game, I think we should expect more interaction?\n\nRiding Sequences: I already mentioned this earlier, but this is another big factor. The devs must have thought that the boat in GoW was their crowning achievement because GoWR really goes out of its way to fill every level with them. When you’re not fighting monsters or solving puzzles, you will either be sledding, boating, or riding an animal. I just don’t understand why this is a core feature of nearly every level… \n\nUnlike real open world games where the mount or vehicle is intended to make traversal easier, it feels like the devs designed the levels to make the boat/sled a necessity. Which is bizarre because the boat/sled is not a terribly interesting mechanic on it’s own. It just seems like they made the boating/sledding areas to give the characters extra time to chat. The boat/sled dialogue varies in quality from college philosophy class to Avatar: The Last Airbender exposition. Probably not worth building an entire mechanic around.\n\nFalse Peril: This might be a bigger problem with GoWR’s story than gameplay, but the scripted action sequences never feel as perilous as the devs intended. Kratos is strong enough to endure blows from gods, titans, and giants. Yet, the game still expects the player to feel suspense when a tree or a rock is about fall on him during a quick-time sequence. This might work when your protagonist is Nathan Drake, but when your protagonist is the GOD OF WAR, it just feels like empty spectacle with no real stakes. \n\nOverall, I really enjoy GoWR’s characters and combat mechanics, but it definitely exemplifies some of the less admirable qualities of AAA level design.",

But even with hardcore gamers I really wonder where they find the time.\n\nGames, especially AAA ones, are incredibly time consuming. Gamers the world over have been demanding bigger games and companies deliver. It seems the consensus is that if a game isn't at least 100 hours it isn't worth the money.  MMO games are even more time consuming as they essentially never end.\n\nIt was the videos of Josh Strife Hays about his opinions on MMORPGs that really triggered this question. Where do you find the time!? And not just time but also the time when you actually want to play. \n\nMe, I don't want to play all the time. I play games usually in short bursts of a few hours and often take long breaks. There's also other stuff I like to do besides gaming. So I do wonder: is it really so that the hardcore gamer ONLY playes games in every moment of their free time? Don't they have other hobbies?\n\nIf I read how many games people complete then it really does seem like everybody is a hardcore gamer without any other hobbies. If not, how DO you manage?",

Here's their pedigree: the Just Cause series, Rage 2, Mad Max, Generation Zero, and a few others. These are fun but flawed games, middle of the road, minimally competent but nothing to write home about. I expect Legacy will be along the same lines, but hope to be proven wrong.

It makes me think writers/devs of large projects are so hopped up on their own universe they've created that they assume you want to play it and immerse yourself despite them not making it fun or enticing to do so.\n\nI'm not saying these games are bad once you get into the thick of it, but this is the standard experience to introducing yourself to a new hit game nowadays:\n\n\\-Hour long cutscene that isn't that interesting with various walking-simulator segments\n\n\\-On-rails tutorial outlining some of the gameplay for an hour that you'll probably forget and have to look up.\n\n\\-The map finally opens up and you have an expansive open world with a bunch of sparkly dots that you walk up to and press a button on to collect.\n\n\\-You then get introduced to the most advanced crafting/cooking/etc. system(s) in the world to utilize said sparkly bits\n\n\\-The game finally begins.\n\n\\-3 hours later you either get invested or realize it's just not a game you enjoy.\n\nGames like those can learn a thing or two from roguelites. Simple gameplay and combat to jump in and enjoy, fewer systems, fewer consequences for screwing up, etc. with enough depth and complexity for the players that want to dive deeper (e.g. Binding of Isaac or Hades).\n\nA lot of gamers as they get older tend to stick to the same franchises they're familiar with and get heavy new-game anxiety. If games showed the bulk of their hand early on and utilized fun gameplay from the start to grab your attention, it would make them a lot more accessible. Frankly I understand the feel of getting overwhelmed by starting RDR2, BotW, Nier Automata, Elden Ring, etc. - it's almost like learning another language with the raw amount of content, and the slow initial 5 hours of games like this (I still haven't got to playing Elden Ring, so it may not be like this.) doesn't help.\n\nIt's like teaching board games to new players - there are games out there that you can jump into and teach as you go vs games that require a massive infodump before you can even start the first turn. The former are the games that attract new players and keep interaction up (I host board game nights regularly). Most importantly, simple games can still be complex, but it has to be in a clever way. Complicated does not equal complex, and having 200 actions you can do doesn't inherently make one complex either.\n\nAny type of media that requires you to devote 5-10 hours to it before you can start truly enjoying yourself is kind of bullshit, and that's why simplicity and interaction early on is so important.\n\nForgive me if it's a bit of a ramble, but it's something I've been thinking of.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you find yourself reluctant to start massive games in terms of content and story as you get older? What would make them more accessible for you? Are there peeves you have when starting a new game?",

That being said, I’m stunned at how slow the game feels at times. I just finished the &gt;!Ironwood!&lt; section and my God, it’s boring. First of all, you do the whole thing as Atreus who, while fine to control, is just not as fun as Kratos as there is just not as much depth to his skills. Second, you spend almost the whole area circling around the main area very slowly doing these random errands. Eventually after more boring walking and some light combat you get to the main area boss which is fairly well done, but overall it’s such a slog and this whole thing is like 3 hours of gameplay. Oh, and this is basically a side-story that feels very disconnected from the rest of the game. \n\nIt just made me think of other parts of the game that had similar issues. For a narrative-based game, it’s extremely stingy with story moments. Yes, the beginning with Thor is cool, but when you do the whole &gt;!Svartalheim part to rescue Tyr!&lt;, there isn’t even a major boss at the end of the realm! You’re constantly told that you have all these enemies out to get you, but they seem to completely ignore you — even Freya, who is established in the first scene as constantly trying to kill you. Yet, she barely has a presence. The story is mostly relegated to Mimir dumping vaguely irrelevant exposition at you while Kratos and Atreus mutter about war. It’s just so slow that I find myself getting bored. \n\nNow, I’m still fairly early in the game so I’m sure things will change, but it just feels like they’re holding too much back. \n\nOh, and gameplay-wise, I’m sick of picking up just hacksilver from chests! There seems like way fewer unique weapon and armour accessories for how many chests I’ve come across. Anyone else agree?",

For example, the nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor/War. \n\n\nFor me, it’s a 2-parter. There’s this old game made by Activision and Raven studios (and probably sledgehammer or infinity ward) called Singularity (PS3/Xbox360 era). In this game, you’re a soldier who’s platoon crash lands on an island when your chopper is hit by an EMP. On the island, you discover a device called the Time Manipulation Device, or TMD. \n\n\nThe device is what the story revolves around. It allows the player to age or de-age items (like repairing broken boxes to complete a puzzle), and jump back and forth through time. It also could help in combat. \n\n\nA device VERY similar to this one shows up in a single level of the Titanfall 2 campaign. It also allows you to jump back and forth through time, which allows you to flank enemies easier. All in all, it’s a beautifully done level that really reminds me of Singularity.",

However, recently I've seen that open world games which have these activities on the map are seen as a big red flag and the comments are a huge negative. \n\nWhat game made people feel hostile against optional content? Or did games try to make this mandatory which turned people off? On the other hand, why are people's perception on Sony games (such as God of War, Spiderman, Ghost of Tsushima) able to avoid these sentiments even though they have this optional content?",

        "text": "This is going to be the most first-world-problem rant ever made.\n\nThroughout the past year I was really excited for (you guessed it) - God of War Ragnarök. I watched every trailer as it first aired live, I marked November 9 on my calendar and I pre-ordered as soon as it became available. I kept waiting and getting excited to finally be able to play it. I even made a huge investment and got a PS5 to play it (along with all the other exclusives). The past few weeks, my social media feeds were bustling with marketing and hype, like it's a holiday. I was really excited to play it on the 9th.\n\nYesterday was November 9. I picked up my pre-order on the way home from school, glad to finally see the game physically with my own eyes. I got home, installed it on my console, but then - I couldn't get myself to hit \"Play Game\". I thought \"Am I really feeling up to it now? Am I too tired? Is my head foggy right now?\" I didn't want to \"waste\" experiencing the beginning of the story on a time where I am feeling too tired, or not \"up to it\" and mentally sharp. Like, I was worried that maybe I'll be too tired to fully appreciate whatever I'm about to see, It'll just unfold before me without me being really engaged and later I'll look back and regret not waiting until I feel 100% there.\n\nIt's worth noting I have anxiety issues such as OCD - that may certainly have something to do with it. Now I'm just scrolling Twitter and seeing everyone get hype about the game and I feel like I'm missing out, but I can't get myself to start the game because I fear that I'm not fully there. I mean, video games are supposed to be *entertainment,* a way to wind down at the end of the day and stop worrying, but I've gotten so hyped about the game that it triggered my anxiety and now I can't even start it because I'm afraid I'll \"waste\" the experience on a time where I don't feel like I'm at full cognitive capacity. So now I'm just playing my old games and staring at the Ragnarök game box sitting on my table.\n\nI think I'll start the game in a week or so, when the launch hype will die down a little and I'll be able to start the game without giving it too much significance in my head. Though I wish I could get excited for games without blowing their importance out of proportions in my head and then being unable to start them.",

        "text": "I remember when I was a kid, my dad was really into the original PS2 Ratchet &amp; Clank games. He never really got into the PS3 games though, saying that the changes and additions made things too complicated for him. All he wanted out of a sequel was new maps to play around in and some new guns, but otherwise the same gameplay. Churn the same game out endlessly and he'd be happy with it.\n\nI haven't gotten _that_ far into God of War Ragnarok yet, only 3-4 hours so far, but this game feels very conservative for a sequel. The boss fights have been an improvement over the previous game's reliance on Big Troll bosses, but thus far, there hasn't been a new mechanical hook or iteration on the combat system that I've really noticed, no fancy new feature to differentiate it as a sequel. At the point I'm at, I've seen previous maps reused but changed by Fimbulwinter, and paddling the boat around the big open part of Svartalfheim feels strongly reminiscent visually of the Lake of Nine- blue sky, clear water, towers along the shore, giant monster hanging out nearby, trading stories with Atreus and Mimir. Maybe my memory is faulty, but I don't really even notice that much of a graphics improvement from the last game. It feels like a direct continuation from the end of God of War (2018), like the game was the post-game DLC second half of the game. If you loved that game, great, it's more of what you came for. I _liked_ Dad of Boy 2018, but I was a bit lukewarm on the gameplay, and I've been a little disappointed that it didn't try for more changes that would have made it stand out as its own game and that might have made it connect more with me.\n\nRight before this, I was playing Horizon Forbidden West, a game that by the end of its tutorial (and intro tutorial map zone), has shown off new monsters, new weapons, new minigames, new systems, new tools to explore the map, new kinds of overworld puzzles, and a much-improved, much more lifelike level of animation to dialogue scenes that had been stiff and lifeless in Zero Dawn. It feels like a distinct mechanical improvement over Zero Dawn as a sequel. We've probably all had series that saw such improvements in the sequels that it makes it hard to go back to the original again.\n\nAnd then I'm sure we all know of games that iterated too far and ruined their gameplay. The mechanics from Mass Effect 2 to Mass Effect 3 stayed largely the same (ME1 to ME2 saw major gameplay changes, but overall had a similar feeling), but some of the features were iterated on, like having the talent trees split off and giving weapons more customization options with weapon mods. But Andromeda drastically iterated on the gameplay mechanics to the point that I lost the feeling of playing a Mass Effect game.\n\nIf you connect with a game strongly, do you just want more of that same game? Do you prefer (overall) for developers to take risks and evolve- even if it potentially turns out bad? When do you think staleness starts to kick in for you even for games that you love(d)? Is it an issue of development time, as it takes longer to create a game, do the iterations (or lack of iterations) just feel more pronounced than when games had 1-2 year development cycles and could adapt to changes in the industry over time?",

There's no inflections to denote certain emotions, no range in terms of his vocal performance, and it's really difficult to try and surmise Atreus emotional state when he seems to never change regardless of context. I'm not someone who usually criticizes acting. As long as someone's performance doesn't seem counter to what the game has presented in characterization or context, I'm not that picky. But this was actively distracting.\n\nI don't know if it was an issue of a rushed acting schedule, poor direction for the actor, a bad performance, or something else, but I could not believe that a game with this much money and prestige behind it had one of the most important characters in the story turn in such and underwhelming performance, which just makes one realize how good the other performers are in the story.\n\nAm I alone on this? Did anyone else find Atreus' performance in this game to be actively dragging down the storytelling?",

The best description I can give is that it seems like the writers thought they were writing for a James Gunn movie. The purely dramatic scenes are alright or even good (Thor and Odin's introductions were spectacular, for example) but almost all of the dialogue involving Mimir and the dwarves is completely caked in that stereotypical millennial-brand sarcastic/ironic humour that I just can't imagine anyone above the age of 30 enjoying.\n\nThere must be a trope for this style of writing. I saw a meme once with a caption that said **\"Well THAT happened...\"** and that one line perfectly encapsulates the kind of dialogue you hear in this game. \n\nAm I just a crusty old man that needs to lighten up, or has anyone else noticed this?\n\nAlso, it probably doesn't help that the boy's voice actor is *really* bad.

Now that I've played many other titles, I realize that there's not really anything like it (except maybe the last two Deus Ex entries and other Arkane titles). The last Hitman trilogy is one of the only recent stealth game that compares in terms of level design and gameplay diversity.\n\nI'm sad the see that Dishonored 2 did pretty poorly in terms of sales and that Arkane studios are now going for more \"mainstream\" titles (Deathloop was a action heavy and streamlined version of dishonored and Redfall looks.... Not great). I just hope that it's a series that won't only be remembered by a few stealth game aficionados.",

By the time I’m done playing COD or something I’m just frustrated and not satisfied with the experience at all. I felt this way for a long time with multiplayer games and yet I keep coming back to them. I realize now that I don’t get the same enjoyment out of them and now leaning towards quitting them in favor of single player games and overall a better experience and mental stability",

To be fair, they do both look spectacular in screenshots.\n\nIn motion or from the wrong angle though the screen space reflection seams and artifacts are super noticeable and I would rather have a nice cube map any day. \n\nLikewise with subsurface scattering, I've seen screenshots of cyberpunk 2077 where its making something glow in a really natural way. During gameplay though it'll often just look like little bright speckles reflecting the light in a really unnatural way. \n\nIt seems to me like game developers continually latch onto some graphical effect that they're impressed by while the community wants nothing to do with it. Hello enabled by default motion blur, depth of field and TAA.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't just hate new graphical effects. I actually quite like the looks coming off of new raytracing features. Not all effects are of equal quality though, the ones I mentioned above in my experience and opinion 'always' look worse than the alternatives outside of still images.\n\nIs it just me?",

This is ironic, because my wife and others call these very chill experiences.\n\nDays feel too short, so between cultivating your crops, keeping necessary consumables stocked, crafting and gifting things to your preferred partners, brushing and farming your pets, completing quests, developing your town so that you're not bottlenecked from other story elements, exploring dungeons, fishing, sorting your immense inventory, etc. etc. there's not much time in the day to fit other things in. On top of that, once you finish this incredibly busy day, you wake up and have another.\n\nThe great part about games like Animal Crossing and, you know - life - is your days are separated by hours so you have time to take care of everything you need so that you can focus on more chill optional stuff. Unfortunately, when days only last 15-30 minutes, it feels like my standard work week is condensed into 20 minute segments and my brain begins to fry.\n\nSeasons aren't incredibly long, but they're long enough for you to be motivated to accomplish everything you can in the first season since if you miss anything, you'll have to wait another in-game year to do it again, which is long.\n\nIs it a me problem? Absolutely. Nothing in these games will explicitly end your game if you don't complete them. BUUT, your crops will die, your relationships will stagnate, you won't be able to experience the seasonal events, your gear will be underleveled, and your game will go from being completed in 60-80 hours to 200, which imo, unless you're a very select few games, don't deserve that time commitment.\n\nDespite it being a me problem since there's technically no consequences that can't be made up with time, it feels that the game can push you in that direction naturally, especially if you're mentally wired a certain way. It's like how gambling can be relaxing and harmless fun for some but can be a crippling addiction to others.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? How do you approach these games?\n\nI just dropped Rune Factory 4 due to emotional turmoil lmao.",

As it's release day for God of War Ragnarök I'm hype as hell, so, as you could likely guess from the title, this one's going to be covering Norse myth. This isn't meant as a be all and end all, rather a starting point or brief overview. I'm sure there will be some other great suggestions in the comments too.\n\n\n\n* **Gospel of Loki** - Joanne M. Harris\n\n Norse Myth written from the perspective of Loki. A flashy, sometimes shallow, novel about the God of Tricks from the beginning all the way to Ragnorok. A fun, relatively quick read for those who want to see a fresh twist on well-trodden tales. Even if you REALLY enjoy it the sequel **The Testament of Loki** isn't worth your time as it drops the mythology for a Loki in the Modern Age twist. Gospel stands well on its own regardless.\n\n\n\n* **Norse Mythology** - Neil Gaiman\n\n A series of chunky chapters, with each centring on one of the core Norse stories. Gaiman is a great writer who excels with his grandfatherly authorial voice. By his own admission in the introduction this isn't a perfect retelling of the stories, rather his remix of stories that have been passed down for centuries for you to then twist and retell yourself. A fun way of getting to grips with the larger concepts if all you know the Gods and their stories is from Marvel or God of War 2018.\n\n\n\n* **The Prose and Poetic Edda**\n\n If you want to learn more about Norse Myth you might as well go straight to Mimir's well. The formal source of our collective Norse knowledge. Pieced together over time it's a series of manuscripts and cobbled together notes that have been pulled together to create an (almost) complete series of tales. Not the easiest way of diving in but maybe an interesting journey for those with a more historical/literary mindset. Some codices can be livelier than others, which leads me on to...\n\n\n\n* **Havamal** - Odin(?)\n \n Whilst technically part of the Codex Regius that makes up the Poetic Edda, I wanted to point to this one as a personal favourite. Want to read a great poem supposedly written by Odin himself? Oh boy, will you enjoy the Havamal. Great Uncle Odin will impart his timeless wisdom upon you, such as how to treat foes, and how to woo a woman. Not an overly long read and surprisingly insightful at times. Not too hard to locate a used copy or a cheap paperback version.\n\n\n\n* **The Penguin Book of Norse Mythology** - Kevin Crossley-Holland\n \n If you want your myth more digestible, if a bit workman like, and a bit closer to the original (although no such thing technically exists as they were mostly lost to time and re-edited later) here is where you start. A comprehensive, largely agreed upon as \"accurate\" retelling of Norse Myth, top to bottom. Includes a good bibliography at the end which collates where Kevin Crossley-Holland sourced all his information.\n\n\n\n\nI hope some of you found this list interesting. Feel free to message me to give me your thoughts if this leads you to finding a good read. And most of all have fun! Readings a hobby to be enjoyed and engrossed in.",

        "text": "One of the things that can keep me coming back to a game is experiencing a progression system that feels like a rewarding journey.\n\nIn Terraria, as you progress through a world, you not only obtain more gear and shape your playstyle, but you also are constantly given the opportunity to exercise your power by defeating bosses. Either you beat the boss and you can see the direct impact of your preparation, or you don't, creating a point of reference for your future progression which can be very clearly surpassed. If you start a new world, or just re-fight a boss, the ease with which you pass the previously more difficult challenges puts your character's growth into perspective. Even increasing your max health involves going out and searching for physical items. With all that in mind, I would say the biggest strength of Terraia's progression system is that you are always shown, materially, the results of it. No advancement feels arbitrary or lacking impact.\n\nIn Vampire Survivors, the progression is aimed towards a very fast experience, with a larger progression happening in the background. For each run, you get the feeling of massively improving your abilities, but in a ~30 minute timeframe. Each new item and upgrade is immediately reflected in both the growing amount of enemies you're able to fend off and especially visually with the eventually huge amount of projectiles flying everywhere. By the end of a run, the beginning seems plain. The game does not only provide short-term satisfaction, but also long-term enjoyment and variety. There is so much to unlock in this game, and the most important are relics, which unlock entirely new game mechanics. That and all the stages, characters, and weapons you can unlock provide variety to sustain the short-term progression.\n\nIncremental games, too, such as Cookie Clicker or Universal Paperclips are all about progression as you see numbers exponentially increase.\n\nSo, what other games are noteworthy for a progression system that blasts dopamine into your brain, whether it be short-term or long-term?",

        "text": "I recently dug out my old PS2 from storage and started playing one of my favorite games of that era, Jak 2. It's a game that doesn't get enough credit for how good it was, despite being made by Naughty Dog, who would eventually create the Uncharted and Last of Us franchises. However, Jak 2 is an undeniably weird game. It's a mishmash of clashing tones, graphical styles, and gameplay systems. It should have been a complete disaster, yet it all comes together and works. The reasons behind the game's direction were a result of a giant industry-wide shift that could be described as gaming's embarrassing teenage years.\n\nThis shift was caused by a lot of demographic factors and the nature of the rapidly growing industry, but the flashpoint that triggered it was in 2001. That October, GTA3 was released to the Playstation 2, and a month later Halo: Combat Evolved was released on the Xbox. In retrospect you can easily point at these dual releases as one of the biggest turning points in the video game industry. Today you can point to the oversaturation of open world or FPS games as a result of the successes of those two games.\n\nWhile this was happening, a similar shift was happening in the music world. In October the song \"The Middle\" by Jimmy Eat World rocketed to the 5th spot in Billboard. This breakthrough hit would pave the way for similar bands like Dashboard Confessional and Saves the Day. This explosion of post-hardcore pop-punk would eventually gain the label \"emo music.\"\n\nThe combination of these two shifts, games with adult oriented violence and music filled with angst and smoldering rage, resulted in some absurd and hilarious decisions by video game studios. Jak 2 was one of the first examples of this change.\n\nThe original Jak game was a bright and cartoony collectathon platformer similar to Mario 64. It featured a silent protagonist exploring a natural environment collecting \"power cells\" by finding them in the world or beating challenges. It was an excellent game, but it came out 2 months after GTA3. For the sequel, the game pivoted hard. It was set in an oppressive urban city. The main character was now an emotionally tortured madboy who could shoot guns and steal vehicles. While silent in the first game, he has a gravely angry voice where his first line is to shout that he will murder the game's antagonist.\n\nA few years later the sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time would come out. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within had a similar high standard of gameplay, but the tone completely changed. What used to be a whimsical fairytale tone became desaturated, dark, and violent. The Prince, who was witty and likeable in the previous game, became a moody 15 year old. It's Arabic themed music was (I swear I'm not making this up) replaced with Godsmack tracks.\n\nA year after that, the most infamous example of this came out: Shadow the Hedgehog. It was an \"adult\" take on the Sonic franchise, where Shadow acted like a giant edgelord (a hedgelord if you will), fired realistic guns, and would say curse words like \"damn\" and \"hell.\"\n\nThis tone change wasn't limited to just cartoon platformers. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was one of the most critically acclaimed and financially successful franchises in history. However, around this time it started to release the \"Underground\" games, which featured a storyline that began to focus around Bam Margera and Jackass style \"extreme\" stunts. The Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX games ended up losing the Dave Mirra name when they released BMX XXX, a game that inexplicably combined freestyle BMX with boobs and strippers.\n\nThis industry-wide mandate to \"be grown-up\" affected many franchises in ways that aren't as well remembered or embarrassing as BMX XXX or Shadow the Hedgehog. Ratchet: Deadlocked was a dark reimagining of the Ratchet and Clank franchise. Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness had \"dark\" right in its name. After Windwaker received a huge amount of backlash for being cartoony (yes this happened, I was there), Twilight Princess was seen as a darker, more adult game. Even the sequel to Metroid Prime featured a somewhat darker storyline.\n\nI can't pinpoint a time when this trend ended, and you can make a decent point that it's still happening. However, it certainly slowed down quite a bit, and I like to think that this slowdown was caused by a game that was so stupid and embarrassing that it ended up shaming the entire industry to knock it off a bit. That game would be Bomberman: Act Zero. Yes, there was a dark and gritty version of Bomberman.\n\nWhile this was a major trend in the video game world, it certainly didn't affect everyone. Nintendo (for the most part) kept on doing what it always did, and companies that were already making more mature games continued, albeit with much more financial success. But that little era of time signified an industry that was previously built around a child audience suddenly and desperately pivoting to adults. Ultimately this pivot is incredibly cringeworthy, and I think it's for the same reason that our own teenage years embarrass us so much. It's because we were trying to act like grown-ups, which is inherently the most childish thing you can do.",

It being handheld has never been a factor into buying it and playing on a handheld, I have never thought \"I love that this is handheld.\" because almost 100% of the time I'm playing it in the living room or my bedroom like any other console.\n\nImagine this scenario. You have a console in the livinf room and a console in your bedroom. I cannot think of any scenario here within this scenario where you would have time to get a meaningful session out of your handheld where you actually got anything done in the game. The only scenario I can imagine handhelds to be useful is people who travel a lot. I can guarantee that isn't the main demographic of people who buy handhelds though.",

I turn off Vsync off in Documents file of assasins3 where you can config vsync and hz. I set it to my refresh rate and turn vsync to 0. Still when i open the game my fps are locked on 60-62 like before. Anybody can help ? I have original version of ac 3 not the remastered one.",

        "text": "Alright, so I really love open world/exploration games.\n\nA few of my favourite games are Witcher 3, Sea of Thieves, World of Warcraft (begrudgingly included), and Red Dead 2 (probably my favourite game ever). \n\nI've recently started playing Outer Wilds, and I really like it, but I feel like it's lacking the resource preparation that I really loved in Red Dead and Sea of Thieves. I really like the idea of spending a little extra time doing \"boring\" stuff to better prepare you for the actual gameplay. \n\nI feel like this is a weird search, but does anyone have any recommendations for open world/exploration games that do include resource management or cooking? I've tried to search, but I'm getting a lot results on cooking simulators, which isn't really what I'm after. \n\nAny suggestions are more than welcome!",
