        "text": "Hello All!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this actually started out as a post to discuss Kerouac's \"On the Road\" but now I am going in a different direction. In your views, where does hate/racism/sexism/homophobia fit into deciding if a book is \"good\"? \\\\\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a homosexual white male. Kerouac was not all that kind to gay people in his novels. Not that he was violent but used derogatory language with respect to them. That being said I really don't care. In 1950's America that was the reality of the situation for most gay people and Kerouac's thinking is a by-product of his time. I don't ascribe to moral relativism per se but I think looking in the past we need to be forgiving for hateful \\*thoughts\\*. Actions are another story. And ultimately I find the homophobia in his work to be such a small part that it is hard to notice. I remember a few scenes of homophobia (possibly in Dharma Bums) but I couldn't find them again without having to reread the whole book because of how rare and small they were.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like Kerouac because of the level of sentimentalism he writes with and how it seems that a lot of his prose is approaching poetry. For some reason I can easily sink into his writing and enjoy myself but there seems to be an undercurrent that I should be ashamed of that given his negative views. I can separate his writing from what he wrote if that makes sense??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing along with this we can talk about Conrad's Heart of Darkness where the natives are treated as nothing but a back drop for the Europeans. But then the point of the book I don't think is about race relations but about human nature and the hypocrisy of the white man \"bringing civilization\" to different parts of the world. Does this disqualify the book? And then we have to ask the question that the story is being narrated by Marlow who was a Belgian ivory trader employee. Anyone familiar with the Congo Free State will know that terrible atrocities occurred that may have decreased the population by around 10 million (although this number is contentious with some going higher and others lower; it also includes disease).  So then in my mind Marlow hardly taking the time to talk about the native's actually fit's the story. He was working for a regime that could rival the Nazi's extermination campaign in some respects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne final example is H. P. Lovecraft. The man was a racist. There is no two ways about it. I once read, although I don't remember where and it could be hyperbole, that his neighbors/community in 1920 considered him to be \\*too\\* racist. That's pretty damn racist. But then his stories are generally not about race but about the unknown horrors. The Horror of Red Hook comes to mind. The immigrants from (I think) Syria were basically written off as evil and devil worshipers.  I am not an immigrant to the US nor of Syrian heritage. Does my reading and enjoyment of the story speak poorly about me as some seem to suggest? I do not read it for the racism but for Lovecraft's strange way of building this \"I don't know what's happening but I'm scared\" feeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there we go. What is your thoughts? Can a book still be \"good\" even if there is hate/bigotry in it? And is there a limit to how much can be in the book before it becomes an insurmountable problem? Does a person enjoying a book that is misogynistic (arguably On the Road) speak poorly of them? The three examples I tried to show differing types of hatred of various degrees to give talking points.

I felt a lot of 451's prose was unbearably dry, with the odd few interesting passages (such as the opening). I also noticed a lack of sublty which bummed me out but didn't really surprise me based on the book's plot. \n\nSurprisingly, what piqued my interest for SWTWC is that it was praised for its sublty. I'm extremely interested in reading it, and hope Bradbury was just holding out on me with 451.\n\nAfter SWTWC, I plan to read The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving. Obviously, it's a classic. I'm also excited because I know almost nothing about the text except that it has a headless horseman and there is a character named Ichabod Crane.\n\nIf there's any time left after that (I'm a slow reader), I would like to read The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. That's been on my reading list for quite a while.\n\nSo, what are you reading this Halloween season, r/literature?",
