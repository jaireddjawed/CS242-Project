I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question, but I’m looking for some historical/folklore context for the Ladies of the Lake in Arthurian Legends. \n\nI’m currently reading Le Morte D’Arthur by Sir  Thomas Malory and I’m noticing there aren’t any clear explanations about who these Ladies are. \n\nWe are introduced to the first Lady of The Lake when Arthur gets Excalibur, and then she reappears in book 2 when Balin kills her.\n\nIn book 3 (although not mentioned) and Book 4 we are then introduced to a new Lady Of The Lake: Nimue. Here the title is plural hinting that there might be multiple Ladies of The Lake. Wether that’s in title or they are an organization I’m not sure. \n\nMy questions are: \n\nWho are the Ladies of the Lake? \n- are there multiple ladies? \n-are they all magical? \n- What are the historical or folklore traditions surrounding these Ladies? Especially pre-Malory since he is clearly pulling from a Arthurian tradition. \n\nIs there some historical or symbolic significance to their presence in Arthurian Legends?",

I heard that Chigi vase is the only contemporary visual description of the, potentially, Hoplite phalanx.\n\nSo with that said, can someone, please, provide me any *contemporary quotes or surviving sources that confirm that Hoplites fought as a tight phalanx at all?* Or, if there're no such contemporary sources to indicate that a phalanx was used as a formation, why do we have this popular impression that they did fight in a tight phalanx formation (even if we can't agree how tight it was)?\n\nAnd lastly, are there any good sources of reading that go into the depth of the question beyond easily available literature like Osprey publications? Would \"A Storm of Spears\" by Christopher Matthew be a good and informative reading on the matter or are there any other authors you'd suggest?",

So how did they keep warmth after taking a bath? Were there dedicated \"clothing\" such as towels for an event? Because that sounds a bit \"expensive\" (by that I mean, it's a lot of material for something you wouldn't use daily).\n\nI'm sorry if I'm meandering but I really want to understand how did these peoplee bathe without getting out of the water and being extremely cold.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "In western Europe, for many centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, ancient Greece and Rome were seen as the epitome of high culture. Greek philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and many more, exerted a great deal of influence that came to shape mediaeval and modern European thought. And even throughout the Middle Ages, Roman culture prevailed through the almost mandatory use of Latin in higher circles, especially academic, and the survival of Roman law in many of its aspects (though it is true that Justinian’s Digest played a huge role in this regard). So even though Europe went through enormous political-cultural changes, a relevant core of Greco-Roman culture lived on to influence us until today. Even the Germanic conquerors of the former Western Roman provinces adhered to this cultural core, respected it and later some even came to idolize it.\n\nIn the eastern half of the Empire, however, this has not endured. Even though the Byzantine Empire survived in anguish until 1453, it doesn’t seem that ancient Greek philosophy and culture, or Roman culture and Law exerted the same level of influence as it did in the West, even as the Arabs, and then the Turks, came to conquer Greece itself – and taking into consideration that Byzantium was the Roman state. I’m not saying the Arabs and Turks didn’t know anything about the ancient Greeks and Romans, since it’s well-known that the Arabs read Greek philosophy. But even as they conquered Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Anatolia and then the Greek mainland, which had been in Greek or Roman hands for hundreds of years, it doesn’t seem that this Greco-Roman cultural core came to influence them as much. And it is strange, considering the immense relevance it had in the West, where the Roman Empire fell a thousand years prior. \n\nFor example, during the Arab conquests of the 7th Century, they conquered Alexandria right off the bat, an important metropolis pulsing with Greek thought, and it doesn’t seem this had any lasting relevant effect in the sense of bringing them closer to Greco-Roman thought. I can understand that after the Greek war of independence in 1821 their culture could be seen as “undesirable”, from the governing Ottoman perspective. But throughout the hundreds of years of coexistence between Greeks and Turks under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, it doesn’t seem Greco-Roman thought penetrated deeply in their society, philosophy, and Law (even if the Phanariotes, a small ethnic Greek elite lived on and served the Sultan). In the same vein, some Arab scholars read Homer’s Iliad, but it didn’t have the same impact it did on the West. And I found no evidence that the Ottoman Sultans were familiar with Greco-Roman culture or history, or if they studied it at all, even as they held court in Constantinople itself, a city still packed with Greeks. I also know that Islam has its own Law, much as the Christian churches have theirs, but Roman Law doesn’t seem to have influenced the Arabs and Turks in their court system as much, if at all.  \n\nI don’t doubt influence was exerted at some level (state, political, philosophical, etc.), but nothing like in the West. Was this because the Greeks and Romans and their cultural heritage were seen as inferior, conquered peoples? Or because the Arabs and Turks, as conquering empires, thought they didn’t need to incorporate this culture, since they had their own Islamic faith and their own customs and traditions? Could this be because Persian culture was seen as more sophisticated? Or because Byzantium had forsaken part of this culture?  Language could’ve been a barrier, but Germany embraced Latin and Greco-Roman culture and was not even a part of any of their empires. In sum, even though cultures aren’t monolithic blocs and are prone to blend with one another, why didn’t Greco-Roman culture exert more influence on the Arabs and Turks?",
