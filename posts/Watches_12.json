        "text": "I do not know a lot about mechanical watches and I have this old Orient Crystal 21 Jewel automatic watch, which had a broken strap to clip it in place so I went to a watch repair shop to get it done. 2 days later I got it however they did not do a good job on it because the pin fell out of the link and the watch sipmply did not work well. I tried to wind it up and give it a bit of a light shake, the watch started working but then stopped after a few seconds, which has never happened with this watch (I don't really know a lot about watches). this issue of the watch slowing doen really quickly has never happened before becuase it always worked and was working for about 2 days when it was winded up. Now after haveing my watch repaired I am concerned at the fact that it wil not work as before and that there is also a sort of rattling noise when I first picked it up from the guy who repaired it, he told me to give it a shake and I could hear a rattling noise, which i have never heard come from my watch before. Is the anything that I can do to sort this out? Please let me know",

Baroncelli looks very similar so probably that's why I liked it too!\n\nDo you know any other mechanical model that is still being manufactured or has been until very recently?\n\nOpen to any brands.

They all had a chronograph with the tell tale Swatch style 4 prong lugs. I cant find anything only about it but at least 4 characters have them. Maybe they were given out as gifts or something to cast if not a product placement.",

        "text": "So after having this watch for just over a month now, I feel like I can give an honest review.\n\nI bought this watch after originally being in love with the Rolex James Cameron and not being able to buy one through AD channels.\n\nWhen I saw that Omega had taken the concept and gone a step further, I decided to pull the trigger and get one.\n\nThe pros start with build quality being exceptional and it has a decent amount of weight. I like big watches and being used to large G-shocks, this didn't feel out of place. \nAlthough I'll never get anywhere close to the depths that this beast can ensure, I still marvel at the engineering. \n\nNow for the cons. \nThe blue centre of the black dial is barely visible and it is much more pronounced as a gradient on the Rolex version.\nThe bracelet width tapers down quite thinly as it approaches the clasp. This, in my opinion doesn't suit the chunky watch and it should be a uniform thickness.\nThe diver extension part of the bracelet opens too easily and I'll often bend my wrist a bit too far and will feel a pop as it undoes itself. I'm forever clicking it back into place. \n\nAll in all, I love it and will have it for life but I hope that Omega will be able to address those small aesthetic and bracelet issues with future releases.",

The ones I have bought were not particularly trendy so were bought at a discount to MSRP and without any wait.  Buying a watch at MSRP that is below the market value is new for me.\n\nI have inquired several weeks ago about a steel Sky Dweller at my local AD, and yesterday I received a call, and the watchtender said he had something to show me.  I did not ask what it was because I am interested in playing out this Rolex buying experience for myself.\n\nI assume there is a high probability that the watch he wants to show me is not a steel Sky Dweller, so my question is:  What models would you go ahead and buy at MSRP to move up the list toward the model you want?  Obviously one would be an idiot to pass on a steel Daytona.  Are there others that are more likely to be offered where the MSRP is so far below market there is no downside to buying at MSRP?\n\nThanks.",

May need recalibrating every now and then. Needs servicing every 5-10 years costing about $100-$200 depending on the watch.\n* Manual (Handwound): Requires manual winding often. Not ideal for those who want a grab-and-go watch without fussing.\n* Quartz: Most accurate and generally more affordable than automatics. Battery needs replacing every \\~2 years which can range from $10-$30.\n* Solar Quartz: The most hassle-free watch. Essentially a quartz that doesn't need battery replacements as long as it gets some light exposure.\n* Kinetic Quartz: Essentially a quartz that doesn't need battery replacements for a LONG time as long as it gets some movement.",
