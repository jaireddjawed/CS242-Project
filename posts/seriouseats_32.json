I came to it as a second career, but I know it's the one I want to stick with. But I also know that hospitality food service (restaurants, hotels, even corporate dining, etc), while fun and exciting, isn't what I'm meant for. It isn't where I can best utilize my talents to serve my employers/customers/guests/clients. And I know it isn't where I'm going to be able to find the life I really want for myself (working 9 days a week, 26 hours a day, was great when I was in my teens and 20's, but those days are long past me).\n\nSo what else is out there? What can an intelligent, 30-something gal with a passion for food, a killer personality, 5 years luxury service experience, and a work ethic that just won't quit, do to make sure she and everyone else is getting her full potential?\n\nTest kitchens and the like require degrees and training I just don't have. Working sales for someplace like Sysco or US Foods is just as bad as kitchen hours in some ways. I'd love to get involved with Food Network or magazines or some other kind of food-enthusiast line of work, but so far most of the openings I've found are either way above my experience range, or waaaaay below (must be a recent college grad? C'mon man!). Breweries? Wineries? Farms? Big ol' corporate entities? Food show representation?\n\nI know there's a whole wide world of food out there, and its so much larger than just food service. I just don't even know where or how to start looking. So any advice, suggestions, (resume requests, coughcough), whatever, I'd love to hear it.\n",

        "text": "I decided to try to use Kenji's Carne recipe using chuck roast. \n[Here is how it looked] (http://imgur.com/KdXcWQ3)\n\nFollowing the [Chefsteps recipe for turning a chuck roast into a steak] (https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/ultimate-grilled-chuck-steak), I decided to see how it would work with Kenji's [Carne Asada recipe] (http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/09/food-lab-carne-asada-best.html). I had a bag of the frozen marinade and just popped it with the bag as I cooked the chuck roast sous vide for 25 hours at 145 F. After it finished cooking, I seared the steaks in a cast iron skillet.\n\n\nThis was really amazing. I have to admit though, I do prefer using skirt steak, it just seems to have a better, beefier flavor, but chuck roast is so much cheaper, and given that this is less work than firing up my grill, I feel that this a great meal to pull off in the middle of the week. Another bonus is that since its chuck roast, it doesn't overcook even if you cook it to well done, so if you are serving anyone that will absolutely not touch meat with even a little pink in it, then this would also be a great option for serving guests. I actually purposely sliced some of the steaks into 1/2'' thick slices to try this out. This technique actually isn't bad if you like medium done steak for tacos. You can make a taco with half the meat at medium doneness, and then mix it with a half portion of thinly sliced well done meat for more crispy, charred bits. \n\nBy the way, this marinade was a year old, and it wasn't even stored in a \"freezer\" Ziploc bag, just a regular old sandwich bag, and it still came out great. Kenji's Carne Asada marinade has to be one of the greatest recipes ever. So, if you guys ever end up making his Carne Asada, make sure to make extra portions of the marinade if you can.\n\nTip: The bag juices make a great sauce too, since its got all of that connective tissue in it. Just reduce it on the stove top until you get the desired consistency. It really adds to the flavor of the meat.",

But I just got done devouring Kenji's oven-fried buffalo wings - they were amazing.  Every wing had that crispy flavor of the perfect fried wing, without fail.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I only had time to let them rest ~6-7 hours as opposed to the 8-24 that the recipe recommends.  To make up for this, I set the oven to convection instead of conventional (or maybe this is all in my head) when I cooked them and it worked out great.  Maybe I got lucky?  But it was encouraging that they didn't need the full overnight resting in the fridge to get great results.  \n\nDefinitely recommend if you're a fan of buffalo wings.  (Recipe link here)[http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/the-best-buffalo-wings-oven-fried-wings-recipe.html]\n\nPS - first time posting on this sub, longtime lurker.

There seem to be a dizzying array of vacuum sealers out there now and after browsing the web I've realized that there really aren't very many in-depth reviews. They either boil down to  \"Which Food Saver is the best one?\" or \"Only buy chamber vacuum sealers.\" (Cooks Illustrated has a review, but there's a paywall, and their review seems to be more geared toward food preservation and not sous-vide.). In particular, I'd like to see a review covering the following topics:\n\n1. What is the difference between a chamber style vacuum sealer versus an edge sealer type vacuum sealer (e.g. food savers). Are chamber style vacuum sealers worth it?\n\n2. Which vacuum sealers provide the best user experience for sous vide? (Robustness, vacuum sealing liquids, long cooks with higher temps, etc).\n\n3. Which vacuum sealers are good for storage?\n\nSince number 3 may require a couple years to do (as vacuum sealers can preserve food for a very long time) I think a review for vacuum sealers only in the context of sous-vide would be enough to help us out. Does anyone else out there feel there needs to be an equipment review for vacuum sealers?",

And in the heat of the moment, I thought 'oh, well, I'll just add some more water, blend it, and then cook it off remaining water off later'.\n\nIn hindsight, I don't think that this was a very good idea :P \n\nBecause what I got was definitely soupy and watery, both from boiling it for too long and from the water itself, I think.\n\nI also had to make a few substitutions because of what I had on hand - namely I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs instead of the chicken breast halves, I used ground oregano instead of dried oregano, and I unfortunately had to use water instead of the chicken stock. \n\nBut for when I want to try this recipe again (what I did have was pretty good), how can I reduce the spattering that an immersion blender seems to do? Does substituting water for the stock make that much of a difference? And finally, do you guys have any general advice for this recipe?\n",

My big thing with cooking or baking is I have no problem following directions and doing it \"your way\" but I want to know WHY. I wanna know WHY you suggest doing things this way. Lots of you can probably agree that lots of cooking websites just throw the recipe at you and say cook this and it should come out like so. Great Fantastic but I'm not a zombie, I want to know why you should use cold water that is a few centimeters over the top of raw pasta, and cook it for 9 minutes. I was talking with someone who said if you like alton's style check out serious eats. And so I did! Ironically enough, I managed to see Kenji twice on \"The Chew\" (live in audience) in 2016 which was great and he did a fantastic job!

        "text": "I think Gritzer and Kenji are at their best when they do American food.  I prefer Gritzer's Italian recipes to Kenji's because I think he has more of an appreciation for Italian techniques and recipes, and the rustic simplicity that makes Italian food so good.\n\nI have tried Gritzer's polenta recipe a few times and it isn't bad.  It's better than most polenta recipes out there.  But it's never yielded polenta that was excellent.  The problem is that he assumed that the Italian grandmothers who spend all day in the kitchen stirring polenta are wrong, and that it's just about the right ratio.\n\nRatio does not matter for polenta.  If you're making polenta with a recipe, your polenta will be wrong.  I read Bill Buford's Heat (a must-read for any fan of Italian cooking) and he describes how many Italians insist on cooking polenta for 3 hours.  \n\nEager to elevate my polenta, I gave it a try.  Now the 5:1 ratio that Gritzer recommends must go out the window if you intend to cook your polenta for three hours.  At the one hour mark, you must treat it like risotto, continuously adding another ladle of hot water so it never becomes to thick.  \n\nThis is a pain in the ass, for sure.  But I've never had polenta outside of Italy that came even close to tasting as good as my three-hour polenta.  It was fluffy, soft, completely free of any grit, creamy (despite using only a small proportion of skim milk along with water and just a small pat of butter and some cheese at the end), and bursting with corn flavor.  I was surprised today to discover that it hadn't hardened in a solid block in the fridge--it retained it's porridge character and I was able to easily reheat it.\n\nTLDR:  For the best polenta you can make, throw out the recipe book and cook your polenta for three hours, stirring and adding more water frequently.",

Is there any chance of this potentially putting food in the dangerzone after the sear and then resting for so long while still raw inside? Not sure how the temperature gradient might affect things when bringing back down to fridge temp.\n\nI don't mind the extra work associated with the sear in the AM and then right after the cook, but it seems to me that this will allow me to get the most uniform steaks with the least amount of work when people are around.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/6ezusm/the_ultimate_se_manicotti/",
        "text": "This afternoon I found myself craving some kind of pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese.  After sending the last work email around 3pm in that magical \"I'm probably not going to have to deal with this until Monday\" moment, I wondered if Kenji had an article on stuffed manicotti.  \n\n[He does.](http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/10/spinach-ricotta-manicotti-italian-american-pasta.html)\n\nI got pretty inspired reading through it, particularly to get out the Kitchenaid dough roller I bought during a ravioli phase.  I was familiar with the issues involved with spinach and moisture, having already pretty much gone down the par-cooking plus aggressive drying route to stuff as much spinach as possible into a pizza without it qualifying as a stew.  Kenji's ideas made total sense.  \n\nBitten by the \"I'm embarking on a project tonight\" bug, I remembered Kenji advocated making your own [ricotta cheese](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/how-to-make-fresh-ricotta-fast-easy-homemade-cheese-the-food-lab-recipe.html).  Sold.\n\nTo round it off, I decided with not nearly a reasonable amount of time left in the day to go for broke with the [slow cooked tomato sauce](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/09/the-best-slow-cooked-italian-american-tomato-sauce-red-sauce-recipe.html).  Its Friday and I don't have anywhere to be tomorrow.  \n\nAfter a trip to store, I got the sauce in the oven asap.  The only alteration I made was adding 12oz of pancetta I had in the freezer, lightly browning it in the olive oil before adding the garlic.  I love pancetta in tomato sauce.  You get these delicious flavor bombs of nearly disintegrated tangy, salty pork goodness, plus the fat.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly other than eliminating the butter.  Okay, not quite.  The only canned organic \"San Marzano Style\" tomatoes available to me were whole peeled.  I tried mashing them several hours into cooking like I normally do and realized I was mashing the unpeeled carrot into the sauce at the same time.  Whoops.  I managed to fish out the onion and carrot just before assembling the manicotti and mashing things to the desired consistency, along with half a can of uncooked tomatoes.  My wife loves tomato chunks in sauces.  Came out fabulous.  \n\nAnway......on to the ricotta.  The comments on the SE article showed a sharp divide between people who loved the recipe and people who had a tough time with it.  Filtering out the unavoidable element of folks who can't follow basic directions, the one consistent theme was that people who heated the milk before adding the vinegar always had great results.  Needing a full pound,  and not sure about the heating rate of my cheap ass microwave, I decided to follow their advice.  [It worked.](http://imgur.com/a/ktCRW)\n\nI will concur that there was a slight vinegary overtone that I (highly sensitive to vinegar, salad dressing amazes me that it is a food) was slightly off-put by but my normie wife thought was fine.  Texture and odor was bang on store bought, minus the gritty undertones.  I made another batch with the second half of the gallon of store-brand, regular pasteurized whole milk except I changed the following:\n\nSalted the milk while heating (forgot to salt the first batch)\n7Tbs of vinegar instead of 8 to 8 cups (half gallon)\n\nEverything else was kept the same, including the single figure 8 stir of the vinegar into the hot milk.  Both batches were heated to within .5F of 170F.  The second batch had within the same yield in ounces but had noticeably finer curds.  Both were drained for 15/20 minutes on paper towels and were nice and stiff like store-bought but creamy instead of gritty.  [Success!](http://imgur.com/a/OfuZ0)\n\nI then made the SE recommended basic egg pasta recipe except I made it all in my stand mixer with the dough hook.  Worked perfectly fine.  I rolled out the sheets to number 4 on a Kitchenaid dough roller attachment.  I then prepared the manicotti filling per the SE recipe using 15oz of mixed baby spinach and arugula (all I could get at the local store).  \n\nI was able to make 1 9x13 dish and 1 9x9 dish with the sauce and filling.  I ended up with 2 roughly 6x6 inch sheets of dough left over.  Finished briefly under the broiler and garnished with chopped parsley and basil: [finished product](http://imgur.com/a/k56gN)\n\nThe taste was amazing.  Sauce was rich if bordering on too acidic (for me) but a depth of flavor that was amazing.  Wish I tried it with some fish sauce or anchovies.  Filling was creamy without being watery and the spinach/arugula flavor was bang on.....spoke through without being overpowering.  Delicious!  The pasta seemed to be just the right thickness, so if you are using a Kitchenaid dough roller you may slightly under-run rolling to setting 3 and may have some extra if you roll to setting 4.  Your call, as proportioned with your sauce and filling.\n\nOh, huge disclaimer......I made the sauce with three cans of tomatoes instead of 4.  Wasn't short, but didn't have leftovers for the batch I made.  \n\nOverall absolutely delicious.  I can add ricotta to the list along with [pickles](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/quick-dill-pickle-chips-recipe.html) that I can't see ever bothering to buy premade again.  Fast and delicious!  \n\nThanks again to Kenji and the Serious Eats staff for sharing their expertise!  ",
