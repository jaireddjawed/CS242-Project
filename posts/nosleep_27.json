        "text": "Landslide or something much more sinister?\n\r\nMy paternal grandparents lived all their lives in a small mountain village about 30 km from my hometown. I loved my grandfather very much, he was the only grandfather I ever knew.  And he was so kind and gentle with me.  Every time I couldn't wait to go back to him.  But our trips were quite rare as my family didn't have a car and there was no bus to my grandparents' mountain village.\n\r\n My grandparents had 5 children together: 2 girls and 3 boys, of which my father is the youngest child.  Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away a year before I was born.  But ever since I was very little, I used to visit my grandfather sometimes.  He is no longer with us.. but he will allways be in my memories.\n\r\nWhen I was about 10 years old, I had a rather interesting conversation with my grandfather.  He told me that he had actually had 5 children, not 4 as I knew.  His second child, a girl, drowned in the river on a terrible summer day.  Her name was Rodica (we are from Romania, Transylvania).  She was only 5 years old when she died.  My father, being the youngest child, never met Rodica, because she had died before he was born.  My grandparents, devastated, gave her a proper burial.\n\nMy parents chose to lie to me until I was 10, telling me that my paternal grandparents had 4 children, because they thought the whole story would really upset me and I would start having nightmares. I’m not mad at them, now I understand them.\r\nBut, 25 years after Rodica's death, trouble befell my grandparents again, when their firstborn also died, a girl named Maria.  Thus, my grandparents wanted to bury Maria above Rodica, so that the two sisters would remain together forever. \n\nBut here comes the unusual.  Those who dug the pit found Rodica's grave only 0.50 meters deep, lying horizontally.  But my grandparents, 25 years ago, buried Rodica properly, 2 meters deep and vertically.  Since they didn't have time to look for other solutions, because their first child had to be buried as soon as possible, they decided to cut Rodica's coffin into pieces and throw her bones into the pit, because the coffin was already embedded in the ground, after  25 years, and it could no longer be taken out and repositioned.  \n\r\nThe cemetery where this grave is located is on the slope of a hill.  Initially, I thought that maybe, in the 25 years, there was a landslide that led to the unnatural moving of Rodica's coffin.  But, after talking to several elders in the village, it seems that there was not a second case similar to Rodica's.  If it really was a landslide, shouldn't there have been more coffins affected?  \n\r\nI wonder if the whole story isn't hiding something much more sinister. A friend of mine suggested it could be a case of necromancy. Please help. i'm trying to understand what happened with my aunt's coffin.",

        "text": " We walked into our new home as the previous owners handed the keys to our mom and dad. \n\n“Woah…I can’t wait to invite my friends to this place! It looks perfect for a game of hide and seek!” exclaimed my older brother Paul. \n\n“You can invite your friends, but you can forget about playing hide and seek! I don’t want you running around carelessly and breaking anything. You know too well what happened with the washing machine at our old apartment!” our mom replied before Paul reluctantly nodded in obedience.   \n\nPaul’s initial reaction was certainly justified, as the house’s sheer size was a heavy contrast to the rather small apartment we had previously called home. It wasn’t a mansion, by any means, but you’ve probably already guessed it was still considerably larger than the type of residence we were familiar with, for my nine year old mind, it seemed like the largest house in all of Austria.\n\nMy brother and I wasted no time making ourselves at home and familiarizing ourselves with each of the house's rooms. My new bedroom was twice as large as the one in our old apartment. I could now place all my dolls and plushies neatly on a spacious shelf instead of having them piled up inside a toybox in a corner. \n\nAbout a week after we had arrived at the house, Paul brought over his friends and they spent the entire afternoon playing video games in the living room. I also wanted to invite my friends, but our parents didn’t want too many children inside the house at once and only let one of us invite their friends at any given time. \n\n“Hey, Paul! You’re being a bit too loud!” I complained, as the noise Paul and his friends made while they yelled and laughed and played their video game at full volume was not letting me play with my dolls and plushies comfortably, not even in my own bedroom. \n\n“This house is huge,Hannah! I’m sure you can find another room where you won’t hear us!” Paul replied, clearly not caring much about the discomfort he and his friends caused me with their loud games. \n\nI could’ve told our mom and dad about the situation, but I didn’t want to begin an unnecessary dispute, so I did what Paul told me and went to search for another room where I could play without being bothered by the noise.  \n\nI ended up settling in the house’s attic, bringing my toys upstairs and setting up a make-believe tea party. \n\nPaul and I had already been to the attic the first day we arrived at the house, but had found it to be pretty uninteresting, being nothing more than a decently sized room mostly filled with old appliances from our apartment alongside a few things from the house’s previous owners that they had left for us, such as some clothes as well as a large chest which I hadn’t opened and didn’t know what it contained. \n\n“Hannah will be sorry for being a snitch!” I heard Paul telling his friends downstairs. \n\n“So…are we going to prank her?” One of his friends replied.\n\n“You bet we are! If my mom says I can’t play with my videogames for the rest of the weekend, then it’s only fair for Hannah to not have her plushies!” Paul exclaimed. \n\nIt turned out our mom had ended up scolding him and his friends due to how loud they were, and he assumed I was the one who had  told our mom about it so he could get scolded on purpose! But I had not!  Anyhow, that didn’t matter anymore, they were coming for my plushies and I had to react quickly! \n\nI planned to block the attic’s door with the large chest that was leaning against the wall. It was pretty heavy, so I only managed to move it a couple inches. It was then when I noticed that pushing away the chest had revealed a hole in the wall that had been hidden from sight up until that point. It was just the right size for an average child to be able to crawl through it, even a skinny adult could manage to do it. \n\nI had just enough time to grab all my dolls and plushies in a hurry and crawl inside the hole, sealing the entrance with the chest seconds before Paul and his friends reached the attic. Dumbfounded, they were unable to find me despite being sure they had heard me climbing the stairs and going there several minutes earlier. \n\nPaul and his friends weren’t the only ones left in shock, however, as I couldn’t believe my eyes once I discovered what awaited me at the other side of that hole in the wall…another room! A chamber just as big as the attic was hiding behind a wall, only visible and accessible via the hole I had just uncovered! \n\nUnlike the attic directly adjacent to it, this hidden room was completely empty…or it would have been if it hadn’t been for the lone oval-shaped mirror that hung from one of its four walls. The mirror was about the size of an average adult, its frame was dark green and was elaborately decorated with a floral motif simulating leaves. A single lightbulb dangling from the ceiling dimly illuminated the chamber. It was already lit when I entered the room and appeared to be really old, but the mirror looked to be even older. \n\nI admit it took a little while for me to realize the mirror wasn’t quite working how most people would expect it to work…the room reflected back at me did seem to be the same one I was located in, but the lightbulb wasn’t there, and neither was my own reflection!  \n\nJust when I started to wonder if I was secretly a vampire all along, a young girl who looked to be around the same age as me crawled into the room reflected in the mirror. She carried a lantern in one hand and a doll in the other. She was wearing a long and flowy white dress and a voluminous skirt adorned with a pink ribbon. A pink bow adorned her head as well. She reminded me of the way my great-great grandmother was dressed as a child in a really old photograph I had seen at my grandma's house. \n\nThe mysterious girl and I both stared into the mirror in awe, judging by her facial expression, I quickly guessed she was able to see me in the same way I was able to see her, and it was evident she had also come to the same conclusion in regards to me. \n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, I decided to break the ice:\n\n“Hello…who are you?” I asked. \n\n“Hello…My name’s Frida. And who are you? Why are you behind this mirror?” she timidly replied after hesitating at first. \n\n“I’m Hannah. I’ve just found this secret room in my new house while trying to hide from my brother and his friends. They want to prank me and take all my plushies!” I explained. \n\n“Really? I come to this room often ever since my father died a few months ago during the war against Prussia. My brother and I live with my step-mother now, and she’s not very kind to us at all!” Frida said. \n\nI had no idea of what war she was talking about, but I couldn’t help but feel sorry for her. Silently, we both took a step forward and stretched our hands…until they touched. It had become evident that the so-called mirror was actually a gateway. \n\n“Hannah! Paul! It’s time for dinner!” I heard my parents yell in the distance.  \n\n“I have to go now, but we could meet again tomorrow, if you want to!” I said to Frida. \n\n“I’d love to! I’ll be here tomorrow morning after breakfast!” she replied. \n\nPaul was forced by our parents to apologize to me for wanting to prank me. I accepted his apologies without thinking about it, since my mind was fixated on Frida. \n\n“I’ve just had a chat with the neighbors. They’re an elderly couple who have lived next to this house their whole lives and you won’t believe the story they’ve told me! They said that long ago, in the mid 19th century, there lived a widow with her two step-children in this house. She was a selfish woman who showed no love for the kids and was obsessed with the inheritance of her deceased husband. So when she checked her late husband’s will and found out he had given everything to his children and had left almost nothing for her, she became overtaken by greed and rage and murdered her two step-children in cold blood.” my dad explained as we ate dinner. We all shuttered upon hearing that story, even if I didn’t fully understand what  “inheritance” and “will” meant, the thought of a deranged woman taking the lives of innocent children was enough to send shivers down my spine. \n\nI woke up the next day and ate my bowl of  breakfast cereal in a rush, impatient to go to the hidden room and meet with Frida. I brought my plushies through the secret hole and let out a joyful smile once I saw her. \n\n“Good morning!” Frida exclaimed. \n\n“Good morning! Do you want to see my plushies?” I replied. She nodded and advanced, crossing the mirror and stepping foot into my side of the room. \n\nWe spent hours playing in our little secret chamber as we made up fictional scenarios and roleplayed with our toys. Frida only had her doll, which her mother had made for her just a couple months before dying of an illness. \n\n“You’ve got a lot of plushies!” she pointed out. \n\n“Yeah, I guess I do…Do you want one? I can give it to you, if you want!” I replied. \n\n“You really would? Thank you! I would like that one, please!” Frida said as she picked up a bunny plushie and cradled it in her arms. \n\nWe suddenly heard what sounded like intense shouting in the distance, seemingly coming from Frida’s side of the mirror. Upon listening more carefully, I managed to identify the voices of a teenage boy and an adult woman screaming at each other. \n\n“Do you hear that?” I worryingly asked. \n\n“Yeah…It’s…It’s nothing, this happens often. Don’t worry, let’s just keep playing.” Frida uttered. It was a reply to what I had just said, but it almost sounded like she was also saying that to herself. \n\nThe screams ceased after several minutes accompanied by the sound of a door closing violently. \n\n“She’s left the house. I don’t know where she goes to, but she normally doesn’t come back until late in the evening whenever she does that. I’m fine with it, though” Frida explained. \n\n“Well, it was fun, but I have to go with my parents and my brother now. We’re going to eat in a restaurant today.” I said as lunch time drew nearer. \n\n“Oh, alright! Do you want to meet again this afternoon?” Frida asked. \n\n“Sure! And don’t forget to take the bunny I’ve given you!” I replied.\n\n“Right! See you soon, then!” Frida said before grabbing her doll and her new bunny plushie, crossing the mirror into her side of the room and crawling away through the hole in the wall. \n\n“You look especially happy today, Hannah!” my mom pointed out as we ate lunch at the restaurant. I had my mouth full, so I just smiled instead of replying with words. \n\n“She’s been going to the attic, lately! I’ve seen her climbing the staircase with her toys and staying in there for hours on end!” Paul explained. \n\n“I’ve made a new friend…” I uttered after swallowing my food. \n\n“A friend? But all you’ve done this weekend is going to the attic! I suppose it’s an imaginary friend, unless you’re talking about a mouse or a cockroach!”  Paul sarcastically replied before letting out a chuckle. \n\n“It’s none of your business…” I proclaimed, ending the conversation. \n\nWe arrived home at around 5 pm and I wasted no time rushing to the attic to reunite with Frida. I crawled through the hole and into the secret room and…Frida wasn’t there. \n\n“It’s alright, I’ll just have to wait a little while.” I said to myself. And so, I waited…and waited…but Frida did not come. I stared at that magical mirror and into Frida’s side of the room, fearing for her safety. After taking a deep breath, I took a step forward and crossed to the other side. \n\nWhat awaited me beyond the mirror was a house that had an identical layout to mine, but noticeable differences soon became apparent. All the modern furniture I had in my house was gone and vintage neo-gothic furniture that was really popular from the mid 19th to the early 20th century had taken its place. There seemed to be no electricity nor any sort of appliances or devices  that depended on it either. \n\n“Hannah…” I heard a familiar voice whispering from inside a nearby room, which I later identified as the equivalent to my bedroom. But in that version of the house, it appeared to be Frida’s bedroom!\n\n“Frida! What happened?” I asked as I noticed she was trembling in fear and tears were running down her face. \n\n“My step-mother came home a few minutes ago…and she was really, really mad! My brother told me to go hide in my bedroom and then I heard screams…” Frida uttered in between sobs. \n\n“But I thought you were used to those screams…” I replied.\n\n“Not to that kind of screams! It sounded like my brother was in pain…and I also heard objects falling and breaking and then…everything stopped!” Frida explained, breaking into tears as I tried to comfort her. \n\n“It’s okay…We’ll go see what happened together! I’ll be right next to you…” I said before Frida and I stepped out of the bedroom holding hands and slowly made our way to the living room. \n\nWhat we found there made my skin go pale....blood, there was a pool of blood on the floor and pieces of furniture scattered all over the room, clearly indicating some kind of struggle had taken place. \n\nWe heard noises coming from the garden. We peeked through a window and were horrified at the sight of Frida’s step mother digging a deep hole in the ground with a shovel, with a large bag about the size of a person laying right next to her. \n\nFrida’s step-mother turned to look at us with a stare that at first conveyed shock, but then morphed into a face of pure rage. \n\nWe ran as fast as we could, climbing the staircase and locking ourselves inside the attic as Frida’s step-mother drew closer. \n\nShe violently knocked on the door. \n\n“Open the door!” She angrily ordered, but Frida and I did not reply. \n\n“Come on Frida…This is just a misunderstanding! I promise I’ll go buy you another doll if you open the door and let me talk to you. Yes, and it will be a thousand times better than the cheap and old one you have.” She uttered, suddenly changing her demeanor and speaking in a tone that made her sound like a warm and loving mother. \n\nFrida didn’t answer and started crying even harder than before, clutching the doll her mother had made for her against her chest. \n\n“There are a few documents that your poor father wrote before he went to war and died…but he was wrong about some things he wrote. I want to correct them, but I need your help for that. In return, I can also buy you a beautiful dress made by a very talented dressmaker I know. You’ll be as pretty as the Empress herself and all the girls in town will envy you! What do you say?” Frida’s step mother continued. \n\n“Liar! Go away!” I yelled. A few seconds of silence followed. \n\n“Ugh…You idiot! If you had just stayed in your bedroom, I would have spared you! But it seems you leave me no other choice! Open up, you little piece of shit!” The step-mother’s friendly facade vanished as she yelled in anger and started banging on the door.   \n\nFrida and I tried to hold the door with all our strength, but her step-mother wouldn’t stop banging, hellbent on knocking it open. \n\n“This won’t do…Let’s go to the hidden room!” I suggested. The door burst open a couple seconds later as Frida’s step mother charged towards us. \n\nI crawled through the hole in the wall first, but when it was Frida’s turn, her step-mother grabbed her legs and dragged her out. \n\nI attempted to grab her hand and desperately pull her towards me…but I wasn’t strong enough. \n\n“Hannah!” Frida yelled in terror as she slipped away and was left at her step-mother’s mercy. \n\n“Mommy! Daddy! Help!” I shouted as I crossed the mirror into my version of the house and went downstairs. \n\n“Mom and dad have gone shopping.” Paul said as he ate snacks and watched a movie in the living room. \n\nI jumped into his arms as my face was soaked in tears. \n\n“What…what are you doing? What’s wrong?” he asked as I hugged him and refused to let go. \n\n“The attic...An evil woman…she took my friend!” I struggled to utter. \n\n“What are you talking about?” Paul asked in confusion. I led him to the attic and showed him the hidden room. \n\n“Is that a mirror? What is it doing here?” Paul uttered as I stared at the mirror just as baffled as he was. It depicted our reflection…like a normal mirror would. I took a step forward and attempted to cross through it, but all I accomplished was bumping into glass. \n\n“Hey, kids! Look what I’ve found!” my dad exclaimed a few days later, showing us an old key he had found in the attic. \n\n“I think it opens this chest!” he explained as the large chest that blocked the entrance to the secret room opened, revealing all kinds of old objects. \n\nMy brother and father started looking at the objects and commenting on them one by one. \n\n\"Wow! These must be over a century old! Maybe even from the 19th century!\" my father pointed out as he checked an old clock. My brother listened to him, but all I could focus on was a pair of toys covered in dust at the bottom of the chest : a doll and a bunny plushie.",

        "text": "I was driving smack dab in the middle of the California Desert in the heart of summer, blasting the AC and singing along to the radio. I slowed my vehicle to a crawl when I took notice of a man holding up a sign in the middle of the road.\n\nI squinted to read it, but the heat waves caused the words to swim, making it incomprehensible from my distance.  I drove forward just enough to read the sign.\n\n“*DASH LIFE!”* \n\n*What is this guy doing in the middle of the road?*\n\nI honked my horn, but was met with no reaction from the man. I rolled down my window and yelled: \n\n“Get out of the way man!”\n\nI was once again met with no reaction from the man. I decided I was just going to swerve around him on the road. I began to drive, when suddenly  the man put down his sign and spread his arms out, as if to embrace being hit with my vehicle. \n\n*Is this guy fucking insane?*\n\nI stopped my car and checked my phone. I groaned when I realized I didn't have any cellular service.\n\n*Guess I have to take care of this myself.*\n\nI stepped out of the vehicle and made my way in front of the man. I stopped directly in front of him, but his arms were still spread out, and he was looking into the sky.\n\n“I’m not going to hit you. Get out of the road.” I stated calmly yet sternly.\n\n“Would you like to play *Dash Life?”*  the man replied, but still keeping his position. \n\n“If it will make you get the hell out of my way, then sure.” I responded.\n\n“Lovely, oh just *lovely.*” the man responded. \n\nHe broke his embrace position and turned to me with a wicked smile. His face was severely deformed and looked like something out of a failed lab experiment. \n\n“We will bring you there now.” the man continued.\n\n“W-what? Bring me where? Look man, I’m not-” I started, but was cut off by the sudden appearance of Black SUV’s appearing and driving towards me from every direction.\n\n“What the hell kinda trap is this man?” I asked. \n\nMy only response was a sinister laugh. \n\nThe Vehicles came to a crawl, and dozens of agents came out at once, charging towards me. I began to run towards a small opening, but I was caught by one of the agents.\n\n*“LET ME GO!”* I belched as they handcuffed me.  \n\nThe last thing I remember was the agent pulling out a syringe, and before I knew it I was catching some z’s. \n\nI awoke some time later in a dimly lit room, a putrid smell quickly made itself known. I  tried to sit up, but quickly realized my legs and arms were handcuffed. \n\n“Good morning, sleepyhead.” I heard a familiar voice call out.\n\n“Please just let me go…” I asked while crying. \n\nThe man began to roar with laughter at my plea.\n\n“And what makes you so special to be released on the first day?”  the man questioned.\n\n“Look man-” I started.\n\n“*YOU SHALL ADDRESS ME AS SIR AARAV!”*  The man screamed, sounding extremely offended.\n\n“Look, Sir Aarav.. What do you want? I’ll give you anything, please, I just want to get out of here..”  I explained. \n\n“I don’t owe you an explanation. The game will start in 30 minutes.” Aarav calmly stated before walking away.\n\n*What game is he talking about?*\n\nI sat in pure mental agony for the next 30 minutes, hoping that I would somehow, someway be rescued, even though I knew the desire was fantastical. \n\nSuddenly, the lights flickered on, illuminating the room I was in. It was a small, all black room. I stared in horror at the pile of 3 decaying bodies in the corner. I turned around and saw Aarav staring at me with the most sinister smile.\n\n“WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM?!” I screamed.\n\n“Oh, no, I didn’t do anything! You see, these are our contestants who failed the game. That's on them!” Aarav explained before letting out a chuckle.  \n\nI gave no response other than staring at him in horror.\n\n“Anyways, it is time for you to start the game!” Aarav stated.\n\n“I’M NOT DOING THAT GAME!” I screamed in frustration.\n\n“Oh, how cute! You think you have a choice!” Aarav teased before pulling out a syringe and injecting the serum into me. \n\nI awoke some time later to loud cheers. I opened my eyes and sat up. I was in the middle of an incredibly large audience. In front of me was an absolutely horrific path littered with sickening obstacles, such as dead bodies, incredibly sharp knives poking out of the ground,  and pools of a red liquid, which I suspected to be human blood.\n\n“It appears our contestant has risen! If he can dash through the obstacle within 2 minutes, he wins the grand prize of $10,000, and he gets to be set free!  Aarav spoke. \n\n*Set free. All I have to do is run through this, and I'll be set free.* \n\n*“*Alright folks,  *get*  your baskets ready! The game starts in..\n\n*FIVE…”*\n\nI looked to the audience and saw that each individual was holding a basket which contained large knives.  My stomach churned at the sight. \n\n“*FOUR..”* Aarav continued. \n\n*Shit! How am I going to do this? Has anyone ever even survived this game?*\n\n“*THREE…*”\n\n“*TWO…”*\n\n*“AND… ONE!”* Aarav screamed, and the crowd went absolutely wild. \n\nI instantly started to dash for my life  as fast as I possibly could while still being able to dodge the obstacles. I flinched nearly every second as a continuous downpour of knives was being thrown at me. \n\nI screamed in pain when one of the knives grazed my shoulder, although I didn't dare stop or turn back. \n\n“ONE MINUTE REMAINING!” Aarav yelled. I realized I was already more than halfway through the course.\n\n*My whole life.. It all comes down to this.*\n\nI picked up my pace twofold and continued to jump over the obstacles. \n\n“*THIRTY SECONDS REMAINING!! It appears that our contestant has a good chance of winning!”* \n\nSuddenly, the knives stopped being thrown at me.\n\n*They must have run out.. Perfect!*\n\nThe finish line was just a few dozen paces in front of me, life felt as if it were going by in slow motion.  I passed the finish line, and the crowd went wild, mixed with cheers and boos from people who betted against me or betted on me. \n\n“OUR CONTESTANT HAS WON!” Aarav screamed.\n\nI instantly collapsed on the ground beneath me, gasping for air.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Aarav was staring down at me. \n\n“Ya’know, i was really hoping you would lose… but a deal is a deal!” Aarav stated before pulling out a syringe and injecting me once more. I awoke some time later back in my trunk. I looked around and saw that the sun was now beginning to set, and that I was in the same general area I was before I had been kidnapped. I looked at my shoulder and saw it had been perfectly dressed with a bandage. \n\nI turned to my left and gasped when I saw Ten-thousand dollars in cash sitting on the passenger seat.\n\nIt has been a little while since this incident, I reported it to the police but they said they were unable to find anything. The first few weeks after that were hell. I spent a lot of the money on therapy appointments and whatnot, but I'm luckily doing alot better than I was, and I would NOT say the money was worth it.",

Because this is all I have ever thought about since that balmy day in October of 1985.\n\nMy family used to come to this church every Sunday without fail. My brother, Mark, and I would stay for Sunday school where they would teach us some bullshit that they didn’t practice themselves.\n\nMark committed suicide in 1992, aged 13. I was the one who found him hanged in the garage. He has written in his note that he feared for his mortal soul but could not live with what had happened. My parents were devastated but never found out what he had alluded to. I knew.\n\nI knew because the same thing had happened to me seven years before: Father McConnell.\n\nI moved away as soon as I was old enough. Went to college in a different city and barely spoke to my parents, which I regret now that they’re gone too. I think part of me blamed them for what happened.\n\nBut now, here I stand at the very same doorway all these years later. Pistol in hand; ready to do what needed to be done.\n\nI swallow hard and enter.\n\nMy heart is pounding furiously in my chest, and I feel like I may pass out when I spot him near the altar. He still looks the same, although his face is wrinkled, and his hair greyed.\n\nHe turns to me and smiles. I fear I may never forget his crooked grin even if I lived to be a million.\n\n“Come in, my child.” He beams. “All are welcome here.”\n\n“I haven’t come to talk.” I tell him, bluntly.\n\n“You may not need to speak to me, but I am here if you need any guidance. I am but a shepherd.” He pauses. “You look familiar. Have we met before?”\n\nI want to vomit. I can’t decide if it’s better or worse that he doesn’t even remember those disgusting acts of abuse.\n\n“My name is John Doherty. I came here with my brother, Mark, when we were children.”\n\n“Young John!” He cries, throwing his arms up in the air. “How wonderful to see you again!  How are your parents?”\n\n“Both dead, I’m afraid. As you soon will be.”\n\nHis smile disappears and his eyes widen.\n\n“P-P-Pardon?”\n\n“Don’t play dumb with me.” I tell him. “I’ve never forgotten what you did to me here, in God’s house, and now I’m here to take my revenge.”\n\nI raise the pistol and fire it at point blank. Every shot hits. The ecstasy rises in my body as his crumples to the ground. His dying moans float through the air and I ready myself to make my escape.\n\n“One thing…” he coughs and blood sprays from his mouth. “One thing… you didn’t consider… in your… plan…”\n\nHe rises and tattered, burned black wings spread from his shoulders. He flashes me that wicked smile.\n\n“This is not God’s house.”",

        "text": "I’m not even going to tell you what the fight was about.\n\nWhy should I? It doesn’t matter. Nobody had a secret second family; neither of us were spending all our money behind the other’s back. When you get married, a lot of people will offer unsolicited warnings. “You’re going to fight *so much*,” they’ll say. (Aunt Deb may have been projecting slightly.) But what they don’t tell you is just how *domestic* these arguments will be. In such close and constant proximity, the smallest resentments can fester like a battle wound in a muddy trench.\n\nTruth be told, Allie and I don’t even fight that much. Many of our friends view us as “couple goals,” or so they tell us. We’re deeply in love, despite our differences in loading the dishwasher.\n\nStill…you can only watch a woman load the dishwasher wrong so many times, right? *The plates don’t go like that*.\n\nAmong the garbage heap of bizarre advice and stale sex quips a couple will hear on their wedding day, one precious gem lies hidden, often going unheeded precisely *because* it’s repeated so often: “don’t ever go to bed angry.” It’s good guidance. I will give it myself someday, maybe even the next time I attend a wedding. But…when I look that happy couple in their eyes, I won’t just tell them not to go to bed angry. I’m going to tell them why.\n\nIt’s not about keeping that wound un-festered, despite what you might think. It’s about avoiding the small man in the silk hat. It’s about keeping him as far away from your home as possible. Because if he finds you…\n\nWell. I suppose that’s around where the happy couple will stop me. Look at me like I’m crazy. If they’ve hired security, perhaps they’ll even show me to the door.\n\nBut at least they won’t be able to say I didn’t warn them.\n\n___\n\nAgain — I’m not going to tell you what the fight was about. Stop asking.\n\nYou need only know that by the time 10:00 pm rolled around, Allie was lying in bed, fuming, and I was downstairs, calmly sipping from a glass of Jameson on rocks, assessing the situation with a logical, cool head, and — fuck it, who am I kidding. I was fuming too.\n\nGod *damn*, you can get mad during those twelve-rounders. Lila, our three-year-old beagle, watched me with mild interest as I paced back and forth in the dining room, perhaps wondering if I’d gone too nuts to feed her in the morning. My own concern was wrapped up in a frantic replay of the argument. Imagine a sportscaster, analyzing a highlight in slow motion: *“Now, Jim, watch carefully as he says that really dickish thing. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, but that’s CLEARLY in response to the bitchy thing SHE just said…”*\n\nIt wasn’t going very well. I’d been horrible, and I knew it. Briefly, I considered going upstairs to apologize. But there were two obstacles: I still thought I was right, and I’m an asshole. So instead, I decided to go on a nighttime run to clear my head.\n\nI laced up my shoes too tight. I’d pulled the strings a little harder than usual, and didn’t realize it until I made it out to the sidewalk. *Of course*, I thought bitterly. *Can’t even enjoy a run in peace.* With some shame, I admit to you that it never crossed my mind to crouch down and loosen my shoelaces.\n\nStill, exercise is healing, and it wasn’t long before my focus was on my breath, my arms pumping, the slap slap slap of my shoes against the asphalt. After a mile, I had trouble remembering why I was mad. After three, I’d forgotten entirely. When I finally completed my loop, four and a half miles later, I was ready to go upstairs and apologize.\n\nSo ready, in fact, that I forgot to lock the front door when I re-entered my home.\n\nBut when I reached our bedroom, I found my dear wife asleep — or pretending. Either way, the fight was over for the night, and we were going to bed angry for the first time in our three years of marriage. Quietly, I grabbed my pillow from the bed and retreated to the guest room, feeling more sad than I expected to.\n\nThe next morning found Allie and I brushing our teeth next to one another at the bathroom counter. Neither of us were cold, exactly, but we were unusually cordial — more often than not, one of us will playfully smack the other’s butt during tooth-time. There was no butt-touching today. We knew the fight couldn’t resume before we left for work, and we knew it *would* resume that night.\n\nAllie spit out her toothpaste, then cupped her hands under the faucet and filled them with water. She slurped the water from her hands, and then — I had glanced at her at this exact moment, so I saw it all — she looked back up into the mirror, and her eyes bugged out. The water sprayed from her mouth and she spun, backed against the wall, screaming and pointing toward the corner of the room.\n\n*“OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!! THERE’S SOMEONE THERE TURN AROUND!!”*\n\nShe didn’t need to tell me twice. I wheeled around, and I thought if I opened my mouth my heart might fall out. But there was nobody there. Allie had collapsed to the floor, back against the wall, sobbing and pointing.\n\n*“He was there, he was right there, oh my God…”*\n\n“Al, there’s no one,” I said in disbelief, wondering if this was some kind of trick. I crouched down to take her face in my hands. She was shaking uncontrollably. She couldn’t look at me — she kept her eyes plastered to the corner of the room.\n\n“He was … standing right there,” she wept. “He was … I swear … I swear I saw…”\n\n“I know,” I said, even though I did not know at all. “It’s okay. He’s gone now.” After a moment, I pulled Allie to her feet and discovered that I was wrong. She glanced in the mirror and her face collapsed. She screamed again.\n\n*“NO, NO, NO!”* She didn’t even look behind us this time. She bolted out of the room so fast that she knocked my head against the wall. I looked in the corner again, half expecting to see someone this time.\n\nBut there was nobody there.\n\nNeither of us ended up at work that morning. When Allie finally calmed down, she told me what she had seen. A man, small in stature, crouched in the corner of our bathroom. He wore a silk top hat and fancy clothes, like he was a guest at some kind of Victorian dinner. She did not describe his face, other than to say it would never leave her memory, not until the day she died.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I suggested that we look at our smart doorbell footage from the night before. Thinking it would put Allie’s mind at some kind of ease before we left for work. It did not.\n\nWe fast-forwarded through the evening. 7:00 pm. 8:00 pm. Finally, I stepped out onto the porch and left for my run.\n\n“I didn’t know you left,” Allie said absently.\n\n11:00 pm. I returned, dripping sweat. Midnight. All was as it should have been for a while longer.\n\nIt wasn’t until 3:17 am that he stepped onto our porch.\n\nHe was exactly as Allie had described him. Much smaller than me, but with a top hat that shone in the moonlight — silk, it looked like. He wore a suit that was not quite a tuxedo, but that may have been a precursor to one. And his face was memorable indeed. He looked directly at the doorbell camera, for just a second or two. He knew we were watching and he didn’t care. The man in the hat reached out his hand to open our door, and he stepped inside our home.\n\n___\n\nWe never actually talked through that fight, in the end. We’d been brought together by the morning’s events, like soldiers who bickered in the barracks before uniting against a common enemy.\n\nAn enemy who, as it happened, was nowhere to be found.\n\nIt’s a common trope in horror stories for a wife — more spiritually attuned than her husband, perhaps — to witness something supernatural, some infraction of nature, only for the man to think she’s gone crazy. Allie and I might have trod a similar path, were it not for that footage. That was indisputable.\n\nAnd yet, it turns out that there’s only so much the police can do when their suspect vanishes into thin air.\n\n“Well, I’ll be goddamned.” Thus spake Detective Maher, a man who, despite his general uselessness, looked and sounded exactly like something out of a hard-boiled paperback. He looked at the doorbell footage on the laptop again. “Just walks right in, don’t he?”\n\n“He *do*,” Allie responded with a tone. Still frightened, of course, but I’ve never met an English teacher who could abide such a usage error.\n\nThe detective chewed his lip like it was Dentyne, then clapped his hands and said, “Welp. We’ve, uh, already given the place a once-over, but I’ll have my men run it through one more time. In the meantime…” he pulled out a card and handed it to me. “You ring me straight away if you see him again.”\n\nWe stared at him, dumbfounded. “That’s it?”\n\n“Well, what the—” Maher held out his hands, as if to say he thought we were in the process of crucifying him. But he thought better of whatever he was going to say. “Procedure’s been followed here, sir. We’ve taken statements. Copied your security footage. Searched your house, and good. That man ain’t here. Now, we’ll put out an APB, and we’ll increase our patrol frequency in this area. Hell, I’ll even park someone in front of your place tonight.”\n\n“He was *in our bathroom*,” Allie said through gritted teeth and tears. “Tell him!” She looked at me imploringly. But I had already told him — Allie saw the man, and only in the mirror. I hadn’t seen him at all.\n\nThat night, we invited Chelsea and Charles over. Chelsea was a longtime friend of Allie’s, and I could bond well enough over sports with her husband, even though he could be a bit loud and his parents had named him Charles about a century too late. The happy couple had obviously been fighting before they came over, so Charles and I drank and watched a game absently while the girls huddled on the other couch, commiserating about the day’s bizarre events.\n\nSometime in the seventh inning, I stood to grab Charles and myself another round of beers from the fridge. I cracked the first bottle top, and as I moved to crack the second…\n\n***“BITCH!!”*** A harsh male voice rang from upstairs, freezing us all in place. For a moment, there was a perfect snapshot of fear.\n\nThe rest is a blur. The bottle slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor. The girls screamed. And — I *might* have imagined this, or concocted it in retrospect — but had a third female been screaming at the same time? I leapt over the suds and broken shards and bolted up the stairs, taking them three at a time.\n\nI barged into the master bedroom first. Nothing. I snatched the home-defense baseball bat from the side of my nightstand and began to prowl through the rest of the upstairs. The voice had come from here. There was no question of that. I only wondered which room I’d have to scatter the man’s brain across.\n\nI can only explain what happened next by noting that — as you might expect — I was absolutely *wired*. The adrenaline was something animal. I was trailing blood all across our carpet (I hadn’t quite cleared the bottle shards on my flight upstairs) and didn’t have a clue.\n\nSo when I entered Allie’s office and caught a glimpse of something against the wall to my left, I didn’t hesitate. I cut the bat viciously through the air and shattered Allie’s full-length body mirror. I had swung at my reflection. Right at my face.\n\nBut I didn’t feel foolish about it. No.\n\nHow could I, when in the split second before impact, I’d seen — in the mirror — a silk hat perched atop my own head?\n\n___\n\n“They’ve been fighting a lot,”Allie told me in bed. “Chelsea and Charles. Ever since.”\n\nReferring, of course, to a couple weeks before, the night when I sliced my foot and broke the mirror. Our friends couldn’t have left fast enough.\n\n“They always fight a lot,” I say, eyes fixed on my phone. “They’re married, after all.” I expected at least a pity laugh from Allie. I didn’t get one.\n\n“Not like this,” she said. “The things he’s been saying to her…”\n\n“What’s he said?”\n\n“It’s…ugh. It’s not so much what he’s said. It’s the way he’s said it.” Allie sounded deeply troubled, though I didn’t pick up on that until the conversation ended a few seconds later.\n\n“Loud and obnoxious?” I asked with a slight grin. “Cause that’s not exactly out of the ordinary for Charles, babe, that’s par for the course.”\n\n“No, it’s like he’s…” Allie paused, then processed my sarcasm and sighed. “Just forget it.”\n\n___\n\nMonths passed, and nothing else happened that was strange. Allie and I didn’t fight much at all in those months. A Pavlovian response to the horrific events following our last big row, perhaps. But we weren’t complaining. Actually, we barely even thought about it. Things were back to normal.\n\nFor us, at least. Chelsea had kicked Charles out of the house.\n\nI didn’t know too much about what had gone on between them. I didn’t care to. I imagine they went to bed angry *many* times. Allie, of course, knew every detail, and Chelsea was at our house more often than not. Neither Allie nor I had seen Charles since the night I broke the mirror. We assumed he was out of our lives for good.\n\nHe was not.\n\nIt was roughly 11:30 on a Friday night. I sat on the couch with Allie’s feet propped up on me. On the other side of me, Chelsea sat with our dog Lila perched in her lap, happily receiving pets and ear scritches. We were watching a movie - the girls loved kids’ movies, and had had their hearts set on *Meet the Robinsons*, for whatever reason. I had a beer in hand and was too buzzed to mind much.\n\n***THUD THUD THUD THUD THUD.***\n\nLila’s ears shot straight up. Someone was at the front door. And judging by the ferocity of the knock, they did not sound hap—\n\n***THUD THUD THUD THUD THUD.***\n\nIt was not the smart rap of knuckles; it was the slamming of a closed fist. The girls whimpered on either side of me. Lila started to growl.\n\n“What the fuck?” I muttered. I moved Allie’s legs off my lap and stood up. She clutched at me frantically, pulling me back down.\n\n“No, don’t,” she began, but stopped short. Whoever stood on our porch was now ratting the handle on our door.\n\nTrying to get in.\n\nI stood up. Lila barked, a sharp, piercing yelp, which was then dwarfed by an almost indescribable roar of noise from the front door.\n\nCharles had shot the doorknob.\n\nLila bolted up the stairs to safety. The three of us were not so fast. Charles was in the room before any of us could even find our footing. He brandished a gun and stood before us with crazed eyes, wearing a tuxedo and a silk top hat.\n\nThe suit was not quite the same as the small man’s from before. But the hat…it was *the* hat. It had to be.\n\n“***BITCH!***” Charles roared, taking a step forward. “***WHERE ARE YOU?!***”\n\nI wheeled around to find that Allie was clutching me tightly from behind. I hadn’t even noticed that. But Chelsea was nowhere to be seen. A whimper, from behind the second couch, gave her away.\n\nCharles grinned maniacally and took another step forward. I pushed Allie aside and stepped in front of him.\n\n“Don’t,” I said, hands up, pleading. “Let’s talk.”\n\n“You’re a Red Sox fan,” he said, still grinning. “Other than that, I’ve got nothing against you. But I’ll shoot Allie if you don’t get the fuck out of my way.” He shifted the barrel of the gun so that it was pointing at my wife, who crouched near Lila’s crate.\n\nI’d like to say that I at least weighed my options. But what options did I have? I was too far to reach him. He’d blow the love of my life away before I could even start toward him.\n\nI stepped aside.\n\nCharles walked past me to where Chelsea hid. She had time for half a scream before he put a bullet in her head.\n\nThere was a second or two of perfect silence after the shot. I lunged for him then, hoping to tackle him from behind. But I needn’t have bothered. Charles only had violent intentions toward one of us that night, and he’d already killed her.\n\nHe put a second bullet in his own head. He fell, and the silk hat landed perfectly, almost mystically, atop his sprawling corpse.\n\n___\n\nI won’t tell you about the rest of that hellish night. There’s only one other detail you need to know: somehow, by the time the police arrived, the hat had disappeared from Charles’s body. It never turned up. That was almost a year ago now, and things are decidedly *not* back to normal. Maybe they never will be again. And every time I dare to hope…I remember that fucking hat.\n\nLet’s talk about last night instead.\n\nAllie and I fought again. No, I won’t tell you what about. Why do you keep asking? Anyway, it wasn’t a huge deal. They rarely are, despite what they feel like at the time. It didn’t start with a dishwasher dispute, but it may as well have.\n\nWe’ve fought a few times since the night two bodies lay on our living room floor. These new fights are strange. They’re less intense, but they last longer. Think “simmer for five hours” instead of “bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.” I suppose that’s because we don’t dare give each other space anymore.\n\nHow could we, after what happened the last time? When that hat is *still* God knows where?\n\nWe’re reduced to simmering in close proximity together. It can be torturous. But last night, after a long, tense silence, Allie busted out a deck of cards. She didn’t even say anything. Just sat down and started to deal.\n\nI picked up my cards and looked at my wife, my life partner, across our dining room table. In our home. Our dog lay contentedly at our feet. There was a strange mixture of coldness and warmth resting between us that I think can only exist between two people who have started, for better and worse, to merge into one.\n\n“Got any threes?” she asked, glancing at her hand.\n\n“Go fish.”",

        "text": " Part 1 here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uwbrd8/i_heard_my_grandfather_speak_to_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nFor legal reasons, I am just now able to tell part 2 of the story. As of right now, this is all the information the police have allowed me to release. I will send another update once permitted.\n\nThe police arrived maybe 15 minutes after I dialed 911. My parents were nowhere to be found. My dad's Jeep wasn't in the driveway. Two officers approached me. A sheriff, who introduced himself as Sheriff Brown, and another officer, who said her name was Officer Harris. Sheriff Brown asked questions while Officer Harris took notes in a pocket sized notepad. \n\n\"What did you see down there?\" The cop asked me.\n\nImmediately the images flashed in my brain. The blood. The crimson liquid of life. There was so much blood. Blood on the floor. On the walls. There were even small splatters on the ceiling. But it wasn't dried blood. It was fresh. It wasn't plastered onto the surfaces of the room like blood sitting in a house that had left untouched for over a year should have been. It was wet. Fresh blood. \n\nAnd the chair. The chair. It sat there. Dripping with blood. Waiting patiently. Eager for what I can only assume was its next victim.\n\nThen there was the picture. A picture representing one of the worst evils mankind had ever known. Painted on the wall was a Swastika, the symbol of the Nazis. \n\nI told them what I saw. The look of disbelief on their face upset me. I know what I saw. I know I'm not crazy. I know the officers could see the scars on my arms from self harm, but it had been months since that. I was on meds now. I was stable. \n\n\"Did you see anyone down there with you?\" Sheriff Brown asked.\n\n\"No, I don't think so, I don't know. It was really dark and I couldn't see much. I- I'm s-s-sorry.\" I choked out the words. As I finished my sentence I felt the tears flow from my eyes. I started sobbing. \n\nThe sheriff put his hand on my shoulder. \"Hey, there's no need to cry. You're safe now. We're here.\" His reassuring words did little to calm me. But he had a calm voice. Gruff and scruffy, but soft and gentle. I looked up into his eyes. I could tell he knew how I felt. He too knew what true fear felt like.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm just so scared,\" I mumbled softly.\n\n\"It's oka-\" The sheriff's words were cut off by a bone-chilling, blood-curdling scream. It came from inside the house. We looked towards the house to find another officer running out the front door. \n\nThe cop ran towards us. \"Sheriff... Officer Neil.. he's.. he's dead.\" \n\nThe sherrif drew his pistol from its holster and looked at Officer Harris. \"Let's go.\" Officer Harris drew her weapon and they headed towards the house.\n\nThe other cop sat down next to me. \"What's your name?\" I asked. \n\n\"Brooks,\" He replied solemnly. \n\n\"What did you see down there?\" I was eager to find answers. I wanted to know what the hell was going on. \n\n\"We were searching the workshop. All of a sudden Neil screamed. I turned around to find a knife sticking out of his neck. When I looked around, there was nothing. No one. I turned and ran. Oh my god... Neil... my partner. 8 years...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for your loss.\"\n\nJust then Officer Brooks' radio went off. \"This is Sheriff Brown, requesting immediate backup and an ambulance at 703 Washington Lane. We have an officer down.\" \n\n\"10-4. Backup is on it's way.\"\n\nA few moments later, Sheriff Brown and Officer Harris emerged from the house. They were carrying Officer Neil. They set him down gently in the grass. Sheriff Neil placed 2 fingers on his neck. After a few seconds, he looked up at Officer Brooks. \"Well, he's not dead. Yet.\"\n\nBackup arrived shortly after. The ambulance pulled up and the EMT's got out and loaded Officer Neil onto a stretcher and into the ambulance, then quickly sped away. 4 police cars drove up shortly after. \n\n8 officers stepped out from the vehicles and gathered around Sheriff Brown. \"Listen up. We need to set up a half mile perimeter around this house. Nothing gets in or out. We don't know who or what we're looking for, but they should be considered armed and dangerous. Officer Brooks, take Jordyn down to the station for further questioning. Officer Harris, you're with me.\" Sheriff Brown turned to me. \"We'll get to the bottom of this, kid. I promise.\"\n\nThe officers piled into their cars and drove off. Officer Neil walked me over to his car and we got in. On the way to the station, he stopped at a nearby McDonald's and got us some food. My food order and the words \"thank you\" were the only words spoken the entire ride.\n\nWhen we got to the station, they put me in a room. I ate my food and sat quietly. A few moments later, an officer came in. \"We need you to contact your parents so we can notify them of what happened.\"\n\nI nodded and got up from the table. The officer walked me over to a phone and I dialed my mom's number. \"Hey mom, it's me.\"\n\n\"Jordyn, is everything okay? We're almost home. Your father and I ran to Walmart for a couple of things.\"\n\n\"I'm fine mom. Listen, I'm down at the police station. You need-\"\n\nMy mom cut me off. \"What happened? Are you in trouble?\n\n\"No, I'm not in trouble. Something happened. I can't tell you right now, I don't have time. Just come down to the police station and I'll tell you everything.\" I hung up the phone. The officer walked me back to the room and left me there. \n\nAfter a while, another officer came in and sat down. \"Hi, I'm Officer Pickens. I'd like to ask you a few questions if that's okay.\" He set a large yellow legal pad on the table and produced a ballpoint pen from his pocket. He clicked the pen and said, \"So, tell me what happened. From the beginning.\"\n\nI told him everything. About my PC. About the whispering. About the workshop. About Officer Neil. About the scream. All of it. Once again, I got that look of disbelief. And once again, I saw the officer eye the scars on my arms.\n\nThe officer took notes as I told my story. Once I finished, he looked up at me. \" Well, that's quite a story. I have everything I need as of right now. Once your parents get here I'll come back so we can file an official report. Thank you for your time.\"\n\nI looked down at the trash from my McDonald's. \"You're welcome,\" I mumbled.  No one believed me. I know they didn't. It pissed me off. Just because I have scars on my arms from self harm doesn't mean I'm completely bat shit crazy. I don't see things. I don't hallucinate. And while I understand how far fetched the story seems, there are some things about it you can't explain by \"this is a mentally ill person trying to get attention.\" What about Officer Neil? How do you explain that? \n\nI put my head in my hands. I was lost in my thoughts. I wanted to cry. My brain tried to make sense of everything, but it couldn't. This move was supposed to be good for us. For my family. It was supposed to be a fresh start, a way for us to get away from that small town in Ohio and everything we went through there. My family and I had worked hard through my high school years to get me stable and make our dysfunctional family functional again. Dad quit drinking. Mom quit using. I quit my drinking and using. The 3 of us, recovering addicts, to have a fresh start. But now this.\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the door opening. I looked up and saw my mom and dad, accompanied by Officer Pickens. My mom rushed over to me, hugging and kissing me. \"Are you okay? What happened? What's going on?\" She rapid fired all the questions a concerned mother would. She started crying. \n\nOfficer Pickens interrupted her. \"Please, there will be time for a family reunion once this is over. But right now, if what your child is saying is true, we have a possible killer on the loose.\" \n\n\"Of course, Officer.\" My parents sat next to me and Pickens sat across us. This time, he had a vanilla file folder with the words \"ANDERSON POLICE REPORT FILE, CONFIDENTIAL\" and a police emblem printed on it.\nHe opened it and took out a bunch of papers. He gave me a pen and started filling out paperwork, then giving it to me to sign and date. \n\nMy mom had all sorts of questions for Pickens. He ignored most of them, or offered short, one or two word responses to them. My dad was silent. He sat there, his hands folded on the table and his lips pursed.\n\nAfter what seemed like hours of paperwork, we had finished. Officer Pickens had gathered some general information about my parents and I, and took an official report of my story. He closed the file and looked up at us. \"On behalf of the Anderson Police Department, I'd like to thank you for your time and patience today. Let me talk to some folks and we'll see about getting you out of here.\"",

Caleb knew all the urban legends in town. \n\nMe and his twin sister, Beck, would go along with him in search of proof and the chance to glimpse the supernatural.\n\nThere was the lizard man, the murder house on Ash Street, the abandoned sanatorium, where a cult performed black magic and human sacrifices, and, of course, the Bunny Bridge, which was said to be a portal into hell.\n\nThey were all easily debunked.\n\nThey arrested the lizard man for illegally owning and selling exotic wild animals.\n\nThe Ash murder house was the scene of a familicide, but it no longer exists, as it was demolished a few years ago and transformed into a memorial garden.\n\nThe sanatorium, while incredibly creepy, housed no cult, just a group of acid-dropping goths who were happy to share their drugs with us.\n\nAnd the Bunny Bridge was not a portal to hell but the home of territorial wasps who had taken the bridge as their own.\n\nAnd then there was the Church in the woods and the cemetery surrounding it.\n\nThe legend in town said a powerful witch lived there, surrounded by the graves of her children. They said if she caught you trespassing, she would steal your soul and keep you for eternity as her child.\n\nIt was interesting, sure, especially as try as we might, we could never find the church. There was a ritual you had to perform, and of course, none of us knew what that entailed.\n\nWe figured it was just the adult’s way of scaring us into staying out of the woods.\n\nWhen Caleb talked about the other legends, it was with harmless fascination. The church was different.\n\nHe spoke about it in hushed reverence.\n\nHe wanted to be the first to find it, and he vowed he would.\n\n“I’m going to find it,” he said one night as we ate pizza and watched movies.\n\n“Sure,” Beck said, her mouth full of sauce and cheese. “You do that, Caleb.”\n\n“I am,” he said, uncharacteristically serious.\n\n“I’m going to find it, guys, I will, and then I’ll show you.”\n\nBeck and I shared a look, and she shrugged.\n\n“Okay,” she said. “We believe you.”\n\n❧\n\nI saw little of Caleb for the rest of the year, and I forgot all about the church.\n\nThe school year had started, and as a senior, I was so busy that I had no time to think of urban legends.\n\nInstead, I focused on my AP classes, college applications, counseling meetings, applying for scholarships, midterms, finals, and prom.\n\nAs busy as we were, me and Beck made time for one another. We had been dating for five years, and I was a regular fixture at her house, as mine was hectic because of my four younger brothers.\n\nThat was the night that changed everything.\n\nIt was a typical Friday night with Beck and me eating pizza and watching some crappy horror films.\n\nI asked her how Caleb was doing, as his absence was pronounced tonight. He would usually join us.\n\n“Is he okay?” I asked. “I haven’t seen him around lately.”\n\n“You wouldn’t,” Beck said. “He’s basically on house arrest. Dad found out he’s failing three classes and might not graduate. He’s allowed to go to school and the bathroom, and that’s it.”\n\nShe said this casually, but I knew she was worried.\n\n“What’s going on with him, Beck?” I asked.\n\nBut she wouldn’t look at me, and I changed the subject.\n\n❧\n\nWe were engrossed in the movie when Caleb burst into Beck’s room. His eyes were wide and manic, and with his wild hair and untamed beard, I barely recognized him.\n\n“Lourdes! Beck! You guys, I did it! I did it; I finally found it!”\n\n“Stop it, Caleb,” Beck said sharply. “Get out, or I’ll call dad.”\n\nCaleb ignores his sister and sets his attention on me. He was trembling in his excitement. “I found it, Lourdes. I found the church!”\n\nI was confused at first, and then realization dawned on me.\n\n“You found it?” I say in genuine amazement. “How?”\n\nCaleb goes into a long-winded explanation that I don’t even attempt to follow.\n\n“The trees! I figured out that you have to trust the trees. And then the crows follow them, but not the bats; the bats are liars. And the grave! The baby’s grave. It’s there; it’s all there!”\n\nHe babbles nonsensically and paces back and forth.\n\nHe looks crazy; I thought. He looks possessed.\n\nWas this what he had been doing this entire year? Talking to trees and following crows?\n\nHis obsession has pushed him over the edge.\n\n“Will you come, you guys? Please, you said you would come.”\n\n“No,” Beck says.\n\n“Sure,” I say.\n\nWe look at one another.\n\nI have to admit that I am curious. Nobody has ever found the church, and this would probably be the end of our search for urban legends because, in a few months, we would head off to college.\n\nBeck looks tired. She gnaws on her bottom lip.\n\nI squeeze her hand gently.\n\n“Come on,” I whisper. “We said we would, after all.”\n\nShe rolls her eyes and runs a hand through her choppy hair.\n\n“Fine,” she snaps. “Fine. If we do this, and he sees there’s nothing there but his delusions, maybe he’ll finally wake the fuck up.”\n\nI smile at her, and she smiles back, but it’s strained, and I see fear flickering in her eyes.\n\n❧\n\nBeck drives, and Caleb talks nonstop the entire ride to the woods.\n\nHe tells us about the twisted trees and the talking animals he encountered.\n\nHe speaks about the faces of the dog and the cemetery with its sunken headstones.\n\nI looked at his reflection in the rearview window. His eyes are wild, and there’s sweat on his upper lip. His hands gesticulate wildly as he talks.\n\nBefore we left, Beck pulled me aside as Caleb went to his room to bring the supplies. Whatever those were.\n\n“Are you sure you want to do this? He’s been freaking me out, Lourdes. It’s beyond obsession now.”\n\n“Let’s do it,” I urged. “We both know that we won’t be doing this anymore after we graduate. I know you’re curious because I am.”\n\nBeck said nothing. She was still biting her lip.\n\n“I am,” she admitted. “But I’m also scared. What if this is a trap?” She said, “Like the real Caleb is gone, and this Caleb is leading us there to feed us to the witch.”\n\n“Beck,” I laughed. “That is the plot of the shitty movie we just watched.”\n\n“I know, but Lourdes, he’s been so weird this entire year. I mean, weirder than usual.” She fell silent again, clearly weighing the options in her head.\n\n“Okay, fine, alright, let’s go, but don’t die and have your ghost come crying to me because I told you so.”\n\nAfter seeing Caleb like this, though, Beck’s uncertainty about the situation makes sense.\n\nAs if reading my thoughts, Caleb stops mid-sentence and meets my gaze.\n\nHe smiles at me and bares his teeth. A trickle of dark blood runs down one nostril, and his eyes roll back into his head, exposing wet empty sockets.\n\nI gasp, but when I blink, the blood is gone, and Caleb looks at me curiously. His eyes are tired, but completely normal.\n\nI smile nervously and turn back to face the road.\n\n“Are you okay?” Beck asks, glancing at me.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, just excited.”\n\nIt had just been a trick of the light; I assured myself. Nothing else.\n\nBut for the rest of the ride, I feel him looking at me, and I know he is smiling.\n\n❧\n\nThe woods aren’t woods so much as it is a grove.\n\nIt’s relatively big, and the paths are confusing; if you aren’t familiar with the area, you’ll get lost.\n\nExploring the woods is a rite of passage for the kids in town. We grew up splashing in the dirty creek and digging in the ground, looking for gold. All we ever unearthed were fat earthworms and clusters of pill bugs.\n\nAt night, we would run through it under a blanket of black sky and silver stars. We played tag, climbed trees, and waded in that gross water.\n\nI live close to the woods. You could technically call it my backyard.\n\nBeck parks on the curb by my house. It’s completely dark outside.\n\nGood, I think. Everyone is sleeping or out for the night.\n\nI’m not sure which it is, so just in case, I gesture to Beck and Caleb to be quiet, and we tiptoe to the backyard.\n\nThere was no point, though, because the gate screeched as I opened it, but the lights blessedly remained off, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nWe approached the woods, me and Beck hesitating while Caleb walked ahead.\n\nI hold Beck’s hand, and she smiles at me.\n\nWe followed Caleb into the darkness.\n\nWe had a witch to find.\n\nMaybe it was because my imagination was already beginning to run wild, but I could swear that as we entered the woods, it significantly grew darker.\n\nThe tree’s branches swayed in the wind, sprinkling us with droplets of rain, and the ground was thick with mud.\n\nWe said nothing while we followed Caleb, but I could tell that Beck was annoyed. Her body was tense with frustration, and her lips were thin as she chewed on the words she was dying to spit out.\n\nIt was nearly midnight, and the sky was pitch black. There were no stars, just the moon, dim and yellow.\n\nHonestly, I was disappointed. With us learning that the church and witch were real, I thought the woods would change into a landscape of phantasmagorical horrors, complete with thick fog and disembodied whispers warning us to leave.\n\nIt was creepy, but it was the same woods I have walked in hundreds of times. The only difference was the volumes of sound that had increased tenfold—the babble of water, the chirp of bugs, and the low hoot of an owl.\n\nThis was the soundtrack of the night\n\nCaleb was quiet now, a dramatic from how talkative he had been the entire ride here.\n\nHis lips were pinched and white in a determined grimace, and his eyes were serious.\n\nWe had been walking for around ten minutes when he abruptly stopped.\n\nI nearly stumbled into him, and Beck glared at his backside as though, with her gaze, she could set him on fire.\n\nWe were at a junction that divided itself into many paths. The left led to the highway; the right led to the creek, and the center most one took you to the farmhouse, an abandoned, dilapidated relic that the county pretended didn’t exist.\n\nCaleb was muttering to himself. He took out a pouch, opened it, and poured its contents onto the ground.\n\nI saw bits of wheat, corn, raisins, and sunflowers. It was birdseed.\n\nWhat the hell is he doing? I thought. Beck opened her mouth, but Caleb held up his hand.\n\n“Please,” he said, still spreading the birdseed. “I can’t have anyone interrupt me.”\n\nThis was the Caleb I knew. Intelligent and methodical.\n\nThe pouch was now empty, and Caleb was still talking to himself. I couldn’t make out a word. \n\nHe stood still for a moment. It had become silent; even the wind had stopped. I could only hear Caleb’s heavy breathing. It looked as though he were steeling himself for something.\n\nHe nodded and then pulled something out of his bag. And it took me a moment to realize that it was a knife.\n\nBefore I could say anything or even react, Caleb held his hand out and slashed at his palm.\n\nI gasped, Beck shrieked, and Caleb was silent except for his blood dripping onto the ground.\n\nBeck was pissed, and she rushed toward him.\n\nShe stopped in her tracks as Caleb looked at her. His eyes were wild and angry.\n\nShe gawked at him but didn’t say a word.\n\nBeck was the oldest by nine minutes and was the stereotypical tough, bossy sister, while Caleb was her opposite; he was shy and sweet. I had never seen him like this before, and Beck hadn’t either.\n\nDark blood streamed down Caleb’s wrist; and dripped off his fingertips like rain.\n\nI felt sick but watched transfixed as the blood stained the birdseed.\n\nWe heard them before we saw them.\n\nIt was a low buzzing, like an annoying fly invading your personal space, but times that by one hundred. The buzzing crescendoed into deep guttural croaking and then a rustling, the sound of many things flapping.\n\nBeck and I looked at one another and then up at the sky.\n\nEven in the darkness, we could see it, a dark cloud coming closer and closer.\n\nThere is no fucking way, I thought. What the fuck?\n\nThey were crows, dozens and dozens of crows flying towards us, their maniacal cawing so loud that I temporarily went deaf.\n\nThere were so many of them they blocked out the faraway moon. They plunged us into absolute darkness, and now deaf and blind, I could only feel their presence. Their feathers struck my face.\n\nA group of crows is called a murder, I thought wildly.\n\nMurdermurdermurdermurdermur\n\nAnd then my senses returned to me. The moon reappeared, and I watched as they flew towards Caleb and descended onto the birdseed hungrily.\n\nIt was silent except for the clicking of beaks.\n\n“What in the absolute fuck?” Beck muttered. “Caleb, what the fuck is going on?”\n\nCaleb turned his gaze away from the crows he had been watching with interest.\n\nThey ate the birdseed until it was gone and then, in complete synchronization, took flight towards the path on the left.\n\nCaleb looked at us with a slight grin on his face.\n\n“I told you we have to follow the crows,” he said.\n\n“Dramatic much?” Beck said under her breath.\n\nCaleb ignores her. His eyes are tracking the crows.\n\n “Let’s -” he says, and then freezes.\n\nFor the first time tonight, he looks scared, and that scares me.\n\nMy stomach drops as I follow his gaze, and my heart is pounding so hard it hurts.\n\nTwo shadowy figures have emerged from the thicket of trees ahead of us, and I can feel the hate and the evil emanating from them.\n\nThey stagger toward us, hands outstretched, reaching with long, thin fingers. And I know that this is the witch and her minion, ready to gouge out our eyes and eat our souls.\n\nI scream. Beck screams. Caleb screams.\n\nAnd then, shockingly, Caleb’s shriek cuts off and turns into laughter.\n\n“Oh, you guys came! You made it!” He says gleefully.\n\nI blink, and the shadows come into focus, the moonlight unveiling them.\n\nA boy and a girl around our age stare back at us. The girl’s full lips are twisted into a sly smile.\n\nWhat is she doing here? I think.\n\n“Oh god, not you.” Beck says, her voice dripping with disdain.“What are you doing here?”\n\nThe girl in front of us is still smiling. Her pretty brown face is haughty, and her hair is long and woven into tiny braids.\n\nShe pushes a braid out of her face with one long, lacquered nail.\n\n“I could ask the same of you, Rebecka.” She says snidely. “Why are you here?”\n\n“Caleb is my brother, dumbass. I don’t have to answer you.”\n\n“And Caleb is my boyfriend, Rebecka. I don’t have to answer you either.”\n\nBeck turns to Caleb, enraged.\n\n“You told me you guys broke up!” She says, and Caleb has the grace to look ashamed. He looks down at the ground, his cheeks burning.\n\n“Well, we did, but then Madeline - “\n\nMadeline saunters over to Caleb and wraps her arms around his waist. She glares at Beck.\n\n“Why do you think we must tell you everything about our relationship? What’s your problem?”\n\nThe two bicker, their voices rising. Caleb attempts to calm them down, but they ignore him as if he isn’t there.\n\n“Who are you?” I say to the boy, who looks like he would love nothing more than to disappear back into the trees.\n\nHe looks like a pale version of Madeline with bright red hair.\n\n“Ezra, um, I’m Ezra,” he clears his throat. “Madeline’s brother.”\n\n“Half-brother,” Madeline corrects, pausing her fight with Beck. She stares daggers at Ezra.\n\nEzra rolls his eyes. “Right, her half-brother. Madeline needed a ride here and didn’t want to go in alone. She failed her driving test again and- “\n\n“Shut up, Ezra!” Madeline screeches.\n\nHe smirks, and I do too. “Right, sorry. She did not fail her test for the 3rd time; she just needed a chaperone.”\n\nMadeline looks murderous.\n\nI laugh. I like Ezra already.\n\nCaleb and Madeline have been dating on and off since 7th grade. Mostly off because of Madeline.\n\nBeck hates Madeline for the constant manipulation of her twin, and Madeline loves confrontation.\n\n“Why were you guys hiding behind the tree?” I ask. “Why were you trying to scare us?”\n\nEzra has the decency to look ashamed, but Madeline bursts into peals of laughter.\n\n“We got you, didn’t we? Whew, the look on your faces was so funny!”\n\n“No, it wasn’t funny, Madeline, you stupid cow,” Beck snaps. “You’re lucky if I don’t dropkick you.”\n\nThis starts a fresh round of fighting between them, and my head is hurting.\n\n“Uh, guys,” I say. Can we keep moving? I want to go to sleep before dawn.”\n\nThey stop, and Beck says sorry. She sheepishly comes to my side while Madeline hugs Caleb’s waist.\n\n“Lead the way,” Beck says somewhat resignedly. “We’re all here, so time to meet this witch.”\n\nCaleb smiles and gestures toward the trees where the crows have perched.\n\nThey fly towards them, and the trees part. Some bend and others uproot themselves. Their branches arch and their trunks twist to reveal a hidden path.\n\nA path that shimmers in a kaleidoscope of patterns made up of colors I have no name for.\n\nI don’t think there is a word to describe how I feel at this moment, but if I had to settle on one, it would be enchanted. It deepens with every step I take. What is this place that ceremony, blood, and crows have revealed?\n\nI’m tripping. Much harder than the time I took acid in that rotting asylum.\n\nI like it, though.\n\nI can see the air moving, and the wind calls my name.\n\nThe trees are whispering to one another, and the crows have once again perched themselves on their waving branches, silent and staring\n\nThey see everything.\n\nThis is it, I think giddily. This is where I want to die.\n\nI do not know where that thought comes from, and I don’t care.\n\nThere is a rumbling underneath me that makes my entire body shake, and without looking, I know the crooked trees have straightened and returned to their respective roots.\n\nI know that the path behind us has closed.\n\n❧\n\nThe bats are following me, and they’re telling me horrible things.\n\n“Somebody died in the creek, you know—a young boy,” one whispers.\n\n“His body was swollen and blue when they fished him out,” another bat sneers. “And when they placed him on the dirt, his stomach burst and was full of maggots.”\n\n“Don’t you want to know what the farmer’s wife thought as he bashed her head open?” The third bat giggles. “Oh, the things you think while you die. You’d be surprised, oh, you would be surprised.”\n\nThey won’t stop, and I can still hear them. They won’t stop.\n\nThe bats are liars, Caleb had said. Okay, but a boy had drowned in the creek. We had been friends, and I remember seeing the police officers trudge into the woods and come out holding a large black bag, looking pale.\n\nAnd the farmer in that farmhouse had murdered his wife and then shot himself with his shotgun after.\n\nNot lies, truths.\n\nI wonder if anybody else is experiencing what I am. I look around me, and Beck is pale, Madeline’s eyes are wide and afraid, and Ezra’s cheeks are wet with tears, and when - he looks at me, I see his eyes are red.\n\nOnly Caleb looks unperturbed.\n\nMaybe Beck was right, I think. Perhaps he has made a deal with the witch, and we are his sacrifices.\n\n“She won’t take your eyes,” the bat says, so close to my ear that its fur tickles me. “She’ll rip out your heart and make you eat it, and then she’ll bury you alive.”\n\n“Stop,” I mutter and shoo it away. “Go away, you little shit.”\n\nI try to focus on where I am and where we are going. Beck’s hand is warm and soft and that grounds me.\n\nIt’s quiet, and the crows unfurl in the sky like streaming ribbons. Occasionally, they shed a feather, and it drifts down\n\ndown\n\ndown\n\nI catch one and marvel at its beauty. It shimmers in my hand, embedded with dark jewels.\n\nI turn it over to inspect it further, and when I do, the jewels shift and crawl over my wrist. They trail down my arm and creep up my neck; they burrow themselves into my hair.\n\nI drop the feather and pat myself as if I were on fire. I itch all over.\n\nThey fall off me like raindrops and scurry away on the ground. Not jewels, I thought, feeling sick. Bugs.\n\nBeck looks disgusted and over it. She says nothing, but I know she wants to.\n\nThe deeper we walk into the woods, the trippier it gets.\n\nThe sky is red; there’s no moon or sun; everything burns.\n\nThe flat ground has transformed into crumbling cobblestone, and I know I shouldn’t be amazed after everything I’ve experienced so far, but oh, I am.\n\nMy body vibrates with every step, and it is thrumming with energy. It feels good; it feels really, really good.\n\nThe air has changed; it smells sweet but unpleasant. It reminds me of the smell of rotting fruit.\n\nThe trees are breathing. Slow inhales and loud exhales make their branches quiver.\n\nEverything around me is shimmering, and I am blinded by sensations and colors\n\nMy vision distorts, and what I see is terrifying. Beck’s eyes are large black pools, and her mouth is wide and screaming.\n\nMadeline’s mouth stretches from ear to ear like the smug Cheshire Cat.\n\nEzra’s red hair is on fire, and when I look at him, I see his eyes have burst and are running down his face like egg yolk.\n\nCaleb turns to look at me, and he is bloated and blue. When he opens his mouth to speak, wriggling maggots dribble out.\n\nHis mouth keeps moving, but I can’t hear him. All I hear is a high-keening whistle.\n\nIt gets higher and higher, louder and louder, and I feel something hot and wet drip out of my ears. I touch it, and my fingers come away smeared with dark red blood.\n\nMy blood clumps together and then breaks apart.\n\nIt transforms into ruby red jewels that then turn into bugs.\n\nThey climb up my arm and chew through my neck. They dig into the whorls of my brain.\n\nMy skull is burning, and I hear screams.\n\nBloodcurdling screams make the leaves on the trees curl and fall to the ground, smoldering.\n\nThe screams go on and on, and more blood leaks from my ears. It sprays from my nose like a geyser and trickles from my eyes.\n\nI can’t see, hear or breathe and I am drowning in my blood.\n\nAnd then everything goes black, the screaming stops and the world is silent.\n\nI open my eyes, and I am on the ground. The sky is black, and the moon is yellow.\n\nBeck and Ezra’s terrified faces loom over me. Beck’s skin is milk-white, and she has been crying.\n\n“Are you okay?” She asks after they help me up.\n\n“I’m fine,” I reply, but my voice shakes, and my hands are trembling and smeared with dried blood.\n\n“What is happening? What happened?”\n\nBeck doesn’t answer; instead, she whirls on Caleb, standing to the side with a scared-looking Madeline. His face is blank, and Beck’s face contorts with rage.\n\n“We are done.” She spits. “I don’t give a shit about any of this anymore, Caleb! Lourdes is bleeding from her fucking ears and eyes and nearly didn’t wake up, and you’re just standing there! You cut yourself like some goddamn sacrifice. I’m done. We. Are. Done.” She repeats. “Fuck you, and fuck this fucking place and this so-called witch. You can stay, but we are out.”\n\nShe doesn’t wait for a response. She grabs my wrist and practically drags me down the path from whence we came.\n\n“The path’s closed,” Caleb calls behind us. “You can’t get out that way. I’m the only one who knows the way. I know what to do to get in and get out.”\n\nBeck’s shrieks are incomprehensible.\n\n“Then fucking tell me how to get the fuck out, Caleb, you fucking asshole!”\n\n“Besides,” Caleb says, ignoring her. “We’re already here.”\n\n“What?”\n\nBeck and I look at one another and then turn around.\n\nI gasp, and Beck mutters,\n\n“What the fuck?”\n\nIt is there. We’re here.\n\n❧\n\nThere are faces in the fog of all ages and genders. The only similarity is their eyes. They’re closed as though they are sleeping, but I know they’re not.\n\nThe church looms in the distance on a hill.\n\nIt’s made of crumbling, white brick weathered by time and lack of care.\n\nIts door is painted a dull, dirty grey, and on top of its small structure is a steeple. It houses a church bell that sways gently in the breeze.\n\nSurrounding the church are dozens of old headstones; they jut from the ground like crooked teeth. The fog rests there like a blanket shielding the cemetery, protecting it.\n\nProtecting it from us? I wonder. Or us from it.\n\nBeck and I rejoin the group, and we are all silent in our wonder.\n\n“I can’t believe it’s real; it’s fucking real,” I hear Beck muttering.\n\nI look at Caleb, and I am shocked to see that he is kneeling on the ground, crying.\n\n“Hello,” he sobs. “I’m here again.”\n\nYeah, this is really fucking weird.\n\nI understand, though.\n\nThe church and its cemetery are hauntingly beautiful. The scenery reminds me of a fairy tale, a macabre fairy tale, sure, but a fairy tale.\n\nIt’s day here.\n\nThe sky is cloudless and light blue, and the sun beams down on the church seraphically.\n\nThis is the lair of the witch?\n\nBesides the fog and the twisted headstones, it didn’t look like I thought it would and glancing at the others’ faces, and I know they are thinking the same.\n\nCaleb has finally stopped crying, and now swiping at his wet cheeks, he stands up.\n\nHe turns to the rest of us, his smile wide and charming. I’ve missed that smile, and a sudden wave of sadness washes over me. He hasn’t smiled like that in so long.\n\n“We’re here, you guys! We’re finally here! Didn’t I tell you? Isn’t this amazing?”\n\nNobody knows what to say. I mean, what is there to say?\n\nWe are here, and it is pretty amazing. We have finally found truth in an urban legend. Well, partial truth. We have yet to see the witch.\n\nBeck, who has also been gazing at the church in stunned awe, shakes herself out of it as though she has just remembered how mad she had been at Caleb ten minutes ago.\n\nShe scowls.\n\n“Great, yeah, incredible. It’s amazing. So when are we going? How do we get out?”\n\nCaleb’s brow furrows as if he doesn’t understand what she’s saying.\n\n“Get out?” He repeats, puzzled.\n\n“Yeah, Caleb, get out. This has been fun and everything, but it’s getting late or early,” Beck glances at the sun. “Can we go?”\n\n“But we just got here, Rebecka! We haven’t even seen the witch!”\n\n“Do you not see how creepy this is? How weird it all feels?”\n\n“It feels just fine! God, I am so tired of you bossing me around. We only do what you want to do!”\n\nCaleb is wrong, though. Beck is right. It doesn’t feel good here. It’s beautiful, but everything is wrong. My skin is prickling with goosebumps.\n\nEzra and Madeline look as uncomfortable as I feel. Madeline stares at the church as quietly as a mouse, her mouth ajar.\n\n“How do we leave?” Beck asks again. “You said you know how.”\n\n“I do,” Caleb says.\n\n“Then do it.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then tell us!”\n\n“No!”\n\nBeck grabs Caleb’s bag, snarling, and Caleb slaps her hands away. She bites him, and he yelps and they start slap-fighting one another.\n\nBeck grabs the bag again and snatches it from Caleb gleefully. She sticks her tongue out at him and opens it, and then pulls out a notebook, frowning.\n\nShe flips through its pages and then throws it at him.\n\n“It’s fucking empty, you asshole!”\n\n“I know!” Caleb shoots back, rubbing his bruised arm. He taps his head. “It’s all up here, I told you. “\n\n“Tell. Me.” Beck says through gritted teeth.\n\n“No. Come on, we must find the witch, and you guys will see!”\n\nCaleb turns on his heels and walks toward the church, but he’s not looking at where he’s going.\n\nHe doesn’t notice the small grave marker peeking out of the dirt. If he had, he surely would have stepped over it. And if he had tripped and the more prominent headstone behind it wasn’t there, he would have just landed face-first in the dirt.\n\nBut none of that happened, and that grave was there, and as much as we wish to change the past, it’s already been written.\n\nWhen Caleb trips over the grave marker, I see the look of surprise on his face as he falls. He looks ridiculous at that moment; it’s like he wants to say oh shit, this is going to hurt.\n\nI shut my eyes, but it’s too late. It wouldn’t have done me good, anyway. The sound of Caleb’s neck breaking will haunt me forever.\n\nThe quiet that follows is the longest I have ever experienced. I never knew silence could be so loud.\n\nAnd then the air is ripped apart by Beck’s raw, guttural screams.\n\nShe runs towards Caleb, and we follow her mutely.\n\nEzra helps as we turn him over carefully while Madeline dances around us, squealing in a small voice: “Don’t move him! Don’t move him! Oh, you’re not supposed to move him!”\n\nWhen we do, and Madeline sees him, she takes one look and turns around to vomit.\n\nI take a quick intake of breath.\n\nCaleb’s head is bent to one side, and his eyes are open and blood-red. They’re moving, and they flit from me to Ezra to Beck. They fixate on Beck when he sees her. His lips quiver as though he’s trying to smile.\n\nBeck is patting his hand and crying while telling him he’s good, he’s fine. We’re going to get help for you, okay? You’re fine, you’re fine, you’ll be okay. I love you. I love you. Don’t leave me like Mom. I love you. Please. Please.\n\nAnd then Caleb’s eyes stop moving. They remain fixated on the crystal blue sky. His hand goes limp in Beck’s hand, and she grabs onto him even tighter. Her screams are animalistic and primal, and she refuses to let go of him.\n\nI don’t know what to do, and I can’t breathe.\n\nI feel robbed of my senses, my joy.\n\nHow is it fair that, in a second, life changes everything so drastically?\n\nHe was just here. He was just talking and just fighting with Beck. It’s a dream. Wake up, Lourdes. Wake up.\n\nBut I am awake. It is Caleb who now sleeps.\n\nI am so full and heavy with grief that, temporarily; I forget where we are.\n\nIt’s the church bell that reminds me. The wind has picked up; it’s strong and makes the bell clang wildly. It slams against the steeple walls so hard that I wonder if it will crack.\n\nThe sky is darkening with a convergence of clouds. They overtake the light of the sun.\n\nThe wind is fury, and it blows my hair into my face. But in the wind, I hear a disembodied voice. It’s Caleb’s, and his words make my blood run cold.\n\n“I’m the only one who knows how to get out of here,” Caleb had said. “It’s all up here.”\n\nOh. No.\n\nOh fucking hell.",

        "text": "Okay, so first things first I work for some sort of a diner.  \nI say some sort because its very old fashioned, like 1940s fashion. Anyway,  \nSince the building is really old, none of the cooking equipment like stoves and coffee machines wouldn't work with the electrical system the building had, So the owner decided to make everything work using an underground pump system. Basically there are two pumps that make everything work: Pump A and Pump B. Pump A works for the basic equipment like stoves, deep fryers, microwaves, and etc. Pump B is for the dessert types like coffee machines, baking ovens, mixers, and etc, etc. \n\nAs you can tell, having an underground pump system isn't really common for most restaurants since they have a lot of cons.  \nOne of the main cons is that they oftenly break down which is obviously no good since half of the menu would be \"Unavailable\" or at some occasions we'd had to close the diner midday and rush everyone out because of the pumps suddenly breaking down.\n\nOne day, Both pumps broke down during closing time so the next day, which was supposed to be my day off, I had to come back for the repair which was an absolute bummer.  \nUsually there is only 2 workers and one manger during these repairs, mainly because of paperwork and supervision and stuff. Every time this happens usually only one guy comes to fix them, and one of the workers have to guide them and stuff, y'know, so they won't do anything illegal?\n\nAnyways. During this breakdown I was in charge of supervising the repair guy. It was my first time so I was handed over a list of instructions and it was briefly short.\n\n*\"Instructions for first time Supervision Guides.\"*   \n \"1) Guide the Repairer down to the Underground Pump System.  \n   2) Hand over the *List of instructions for Pump Repairers,* a headset, and a flashlight you can find   \n  inside the workbench drawer next to the barrels.  \n   3) Go back upstairs and log on the computer in the Communications room. Your headset should   \n   already be connected to theirs.  \n   4) Use the night-vision cameras connected to the computer and guide the Repairer.  \n   5) Make sure they don't get caught.  \n   6) Once they're done, meet them downstairs and guide them back up.\"\n\nI was certainly confused about the rules I was given, especially rule 5.   \nI soon realized that the pump system was HUGE! it was so large and dark, the only thing I could see was the damp concrete floor. I understood why I needed to guide the repair guy now. There are no lights under there and to be honest, it kinda creeps me out.\n\nAfter meeting the repairer I did all the basic things I needed to do:   \nHanded over instructions, gave him the headset and the flashlight, and now turning on the computer.  \nAfter putting on the headset, I heard a faint voice.  \n*\"Uh, hey hello? is this thing working?\"*  \n\"Loud and clear.\"  \n*\"Great. This things massive huh? Anyways how are you gonna guide me are there like cameras or something?\"*  \n\"Yeah, Night vision. Anyways turn on the flashlight and move in, I'll tell you when you need to change directions.\"  \n*\"Noted. Names' Mac by the way\"*  \n\"Alright Mac. Turn about 6 feet to the left and keep walking forward.\"  \nAfter staring at the computer screen for a while I leaned forward to switch cameras when I suddenly notice something move at the bottom of the screen.  \n\"The fuck?\"  \n*\"What? the hell happened?\"*  \n\"Nothing. Thought I saw something.\"  \n*\"Well shit man! don't scare me like that.\"*  \n\"Turn left and keep walking forward and in about... uh.. lets say 3 minutes you'll be at Pump A.\"  \nI'll admit, this was kind of getting boring so I tried to open youtube on the computer until I heard mac speak again.  \n*\"Alright man the first pump is on where's the second one at?\"*  \n\"Just a second.. Just keep going right until you see it.\"  \n*\"Whys it so dark in here anyways man? why not install some lights..\"*  \n\"Just the style i guess.\"  \nSilence followed by footsteps ended the conversation.\n\n  \nAfter a few minutes of scrolling on my phone I was abruptly startled by yells coming from the headset.  \n*\"FUCKING SHIT MAN WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!\"*  \n\"Hey calm down now,  what happened?\"  \n*\"SOMETHING JUST GRABBED ME BY THE ARM!\"*  \n*\"SHIT MAN! WHAT THE HELL, ITS GRIP WAS SO FUCKING STRONG I HAVE BRUSIES ON MY ARM!\"*  \nA series of curses from mac floods the headset, leaving me desperately trying to find him on the cameras.  \n*\"FUCK YOUR STUPID PUMPS IM OUT OF HERE\"*  \n\"Calm down and tell me what happened.\"  \nOnly heavy footsteps and breathing responded me.  \n\"Mac, are you there? I cant find you on the cams man.\"  \n*\"SHIT MAN.. IM FUCKING LOST\"*  \nOver the headset i could hear mac stopping to catch his breath, but in the background faint footsteps could be heard.  \n\"Just keep running man im getting my boss\"  \nTo be honest, I didnt really believe him, but I was gonna tell my boss anyways.  \n*\"DONT FUCKING LEAVE ME HERE MA-\"*\n\nA few seconds later, i find my self standing infront of the door to the pump system, silently reading the back of the paper i was given.  \n\n\n\"7) *If the repairer finds them self as bait, assure them help will be on the way.*  \n  8) *Unplug the computer and exit the room. Its too late for them now*  \n  *9) Tell your supervising manager it was a success, nodding after you say it. They will understand.*  \n *10) If you suddenly see Bruises on your arm, quit your job here immediately. Its to keep yourself safe.\"*",

        "text": "They who control the present, can write the past, and thus paint the future. Mix this with the overall average majority in society stuck in a representation of Plato's Cave... and then you will understand my mentality on the world. \n\nYou can call me a conspiracy theorist, and it is thrown as an insult but means nothing to me. On average you can try to tell someone a truth and they wouldn't believe you, for many reasons, and vise versa as far as lies are concerned. In my life, however, it seems people will believe a lie rather than the truth for whichever reason.\n\nDoes anyone think it strange how many people can see the bullshit on the worldstage, and still be manipulated into trusting whatever governments and geopolitical NPOs say? I really think we are meaty, squishy, emotional computers... in which case we can be programmable by the content that fills our eyes and ears.\n\nI have traditional conservative values but wouldn't be caught dead siding with conservatives or any political alignment.\n\nI'm a Christian, but I struggle with lying, lust, hate (which isn't as bad as it used to be, just flairs up like a bad case of a cold sore), greed, laziness, and pride (same case as hate), and if I don't actively try to fix these issues of mine I'm going to be in hell because I am a bad person. You couldn't convince me otherwise, though I appreciate those who would try but please don't... it would be in vain and you shouldn't waste your precious time (not being facetious).\n\nI don't think the world has much time left, and sure as a jackrabbit fleeing from a fox... I know it's not going to end because of climate change from 7 billion people living their lives. Shit, I just looked into the commercial fishing/fish farming industry and that bullshit is why there's so much death coming our direction by way of the oceans.\n\nWe've all been conditioned into believing that the world is evolving through technology... all I see are kidults acting excited waiting for the next new toy while arguing on this site, YouTube, tik tok, Facebook, and what the fuck else they make to entertain humanity.\n\nThis world is so fucked it makes me sad, that someone can try to talk about real issues (and just because it's important to you doesn't make it a \"real\" issue in my book). Not negating that issues that mean something to you, whatever it may be, isn't important but just that it doesn't wake you up to that simple fact: If enough money is being made, nothing will change regardless of how fucked up it is. Only when enough attention is payed that the ugly truth comes to light and makes a few little waves... and with a little time, that shit that humans always do: move on and put those thoughts in a filing cabinet... It happens like clockwork and nothing really changes that.\n\nThe things that most people talk about and focus on is what's popular, and what's popular means it's important to those who want us focused on distractions. They're magicians... pedophile, cannibalistic, evil fucking magicians...\n\n\n\nand nobody really gives a shit, and that's why this world will, must, die eventually. Take care folks, stranger days ahead of us.",

        "text": " It all started with a brutal murder. A dead body was discovered floating in the water hazard on the 18th hole at the mini golf course in my hometown. According to reports, the man was found naked and covered in deep gashes. Most disturbing of all, his eyeballs had been removed with surgical precision. \n\nA summary closure was issued by the police, shutting down the business until they deemed it appropriate to re-open. The investigation stalled but the course remained closed. After several months, it was permanently shut down and the owners put the property up for sale. \n\nI’d grown up down the street and had spent years there perfecting my putting game. Countless hours were spent navigating the greens. My father was a mini-golf fanatic, and he’d drag me there no matter the weather. That’s where I learned losing was not an option. It was also the last outing I ever spent with my father before his disappearance. \n\nThe news of the course's closure broke me. It felt like losing a piece of me; an integral part of my history flushed down the drain. That pain led to me to holding a bolt cutter outside the main fence on a starless night. Armed with a putter and a bucket of balls, I snuck into the course with a sense of excitement and entitlement. \n\nHaving the place to myself felt magical. My stroke was pure and I was playing the best round of my life. Each hole I played better than the last. As I approached the 18th hole, nostalgia washed over me.\n\nI carefully lined up my final shot. Pulling my putter back, I glanced at the water hazard separating the two sections of the hole. A flash of the dead man’s body floating in the water filled my mind. I shuddered, creating a hitch in my stroke. I missed badly and the ball careened into the water. \n\nSwearing to myself, I approached the hazard to retrieve the ball. It laid listlessly just below the surface; the bright yellow divots shimmering like mini-suns. As I reached for it, I noticed something exceedingly odd. At the water's edge nestled in between unkempt hedges was a small door. A phrase was crudely carved into the wood: 1*9th Hole - Enter Here.*\n\nI'd played this course maybe a hundred times and never had I heard of a 19th hole. My curiosity was piqued. Without a second thought, I opened the door and descended down a rickety staircase. Motion sensor lights flickered to life, illuminating a cavernous space. \n\nThe 19th hole was a cacophony of lights and sounds. Designed with a futuristic motif, crisscrossing greens allowed multiple paths to the hole. It blew everything else out of the water. Why would just incredible work never be opened to the public?\n\nGrinning like a madman, I placed a ball onto the tee.\n\n*Are you ready to play Richard?*\n\nA robotic voice called out my name. My brow furrowed in confusion. How could that even be possible?\n\n*You must be thinking, ‘How is this possible?’ The 19th hole was programmed with an advanced AI algorithm that can identify users and predict their play.* \n\nThe response echoed through the room. It felt like it had read my mind. Had it? \n\nCautiously, I played on. My excitement for this hole was overwhelming. Any hesitation I had was easily dissuaded by the response I’d been offered. At that point, it would have taken a gun to my head to make me leave. \n\nI held my finger in the air as if I was identifying the direction of the wind. Scooting my butt back and forth, I lined up my shot and swung.\n\n*Your ball traveled 25 feet. New course record!*\n\nThe sound of fireworks filled the air. It wasn’t my most impressive putt, but I supposed this hole had been scantly played - if at all.\n\nA trail of neon lights tracked my ball. They flashed with excitement as I approached.\n\n*The par for this course is six shots. Failure to meet the course standard will result in immediate termination.*\n\nI scoffed at the attempt at artificial pressure. Whoever had designed this course must have had a sick sense of humor. Maybe that’s why it never saw the light of day. What a shame. \n\nEnvisioning the angles in my head, I bounced the ball against the edge and watched as it sailed into a dead zone. \n\n“Damn it!” I yelled, slamming the club onto the turf.\n\n*If your ball had struck at a 35-degree, rather than 46-degree angle, your shot would have landed 15 feet from the hole. We predict it will take you eight strokes to complete this hole. Termination is imminent.* \n\n“Imminent my ass,” I whispered under my breath. \n\n*Please refrain from foul language on the course. It is unbecoming, Richard.*\n\nI was starting to really dislike the AI announcer. Shaking off the annoyance, I aimed for a glowing rock situated at the start of a sharp curve. Holding my breath, i unleashed the putter with force. \n\nMy ball connected directly with the rock. It careened down the green and stopped just shy of a spinning blade hazard — a futuristic windmill. I pumped my fist in the air. \n\n*Great shot! Take a bow, Richard. Termination probability is now only 77%.*\n\n“Whoever programmed you must have been one weird dude. I mean come on. What did he expect? That you’d kill us?” I laughed at the absurdity of it all.\n\n*Yes, Richard, that is exactly right. Shooting over par will result in you being torn limb from limb until you beg for death. Failure is the worst sin a man commits, and it will be treated as such.* \n\n“Scratch that. Whoever programmed you was one sick fuck. Doesn’t matter, either way, I never shoot over par.”\n\n*According to my database, you’ve shot over par 27% of the time. Your statement is factually incorrect*.\n\nI ignored the statement. Taking a deep breath, I steadied my putter and took another shot. My ball flew through the blades. Unfortunately, I put too much mustard on it. The ball skipped off the edge and fell out of play. \n\n*You’ve been deducted one stroke. Two shots remain to reach par. Termination probability has now risen to 95%.* \n\nA mechanical arm extended from the interior wall. Scooping ho my ball, it placed it at the last spot it hit before going out of bounds. \n\nI shuffled over, frustration rising. I’d been taught to never back down, no matter the odds. The termination nonsense didn’t concern me, this was a mini golf course after all — but losing did. There were many things my Dad didn’t teach me, but he sure as hell drilled in the absolute importance of winning. Whether man or machine, I was obsessed with coming out as the victor. \n\nThere were three potential paths to the hole, each with its pros and cons. The one farthest to the right sloped downward before curving sharply towards the final green — but there were no guardrails on the turn to keep the ball in play. If was going to make par, I’d have to go with a risk-reward route.\n\n“Watch this you AI son of a bitch!”\n\nIntuition and instinct were my guides. I didn’t carefully line up my shot like before, I let muscle memory take over. Overthinking led to mistakes, and I left no time for that. The ball knocked against a flashing neon wall with absolute precision. The backspin slowed it down just enough that it rounded the bend at just the right speed. I watched triumphantly as it zipped toward the hole.\n\n“Oh, crap…” I muttered as the ball started to veer off track. Only a few feet away from exiting the curve, it started to spin closer to the edge. With nothing to contain it within the course, there was nothing to stop it from falling off again. If that happened I’d lose another stroke.\n\nWaving my hands frantically to the right, I tried to coax my ball in the right direction. My anxiety rose sharply as defeat inched closer and closer. \n\nThe ball teetered on the edge, see-sawing on the final bit of artificial turf. I held my breath, convinced that even a small exhale would cause the ball to drop off the green. Silence envelopes the room. Seconds stretched out like minutes. You’d think time had slowed down.\n\n“Shit!!!” I broke the putter over my knee as the ball finally toppled out of bounds. It bounced on the concrete floor surrounding the course. The echoes resonated with my failure.\n\nSuddenly the entire room was plunged into darkness, only to light back up with red emergency lights. \n\n*Par is no longer possible. Termination sequence initiated. Richard, please say your final words. They will be recorded and saved into the database.* \n\n“This whole fucking this is stupid. I’m getting out of here.” Angry and defeated, I stomped toward the door I’d entered through. Just as I reached for the doorknob, a security gate crashed from the ceiling blocking my way.\n\n*Escape is not possible. Termination countdown has begun — you have 60 seconds.* \n\nFor the first time, I felt a sense of panic. What I had assumed to be a sadistic joke was transforming into something all too real. I furiously shook the gate and cried for help — but my calls my unanswered. I fumbled through the flashing lights, desperate for another way out. All I could see were sheer walls and the course. Escape seemed truly impossible. \n\n*Phase one initiating.* \n\nA pinkish gas started to feel the room. My head felt like a thousand pounds. I struggled to stay on my feet. Just as darkness began to overtake my vision, I heard a familiar voice calling it me; it was a ghost from the past. The next thing I knew I was pulled into a space the size of a prison cell and an oxygen mask was slapped onto my face.\n\n“Good to see you again, son. Although the circumstances could be better.” A gaunt man with a long white beard hovered over me.\n\n“Dad…?” I sputtered. “How is this possible? Where am I? Where have you been all this time? What the fuck…” the question came faster than I could ask them.\n\n“There’s no time for that now. We have to try and get you out of here. We need to focus on that right now. Can you stand?”\n\nI rose to my feet. My balance was still off-kilter, but much improved.\n\n“Yeah, I think so. Feels like I drank one too many whiskeys.” \n\n*Hello. My name is Dr. Alec Pizick and I’m the last voice you will hear. Civilization is built on the backs of winners, those who’ve risen to the top of their fields. Society has become lazy and rewards failures — look no further than the participation trophies given to every child who competes. Unless we reverse course and elevate success once more, society is doomed. This ideology birthed the 19th hole; it’s a drastic but needed system that will slowly weed out the weak. Although this is still a prototype, it will soon be shipped around the world and embedded into every manner of game — before moving on to the workforce. My goal is to achieve a spartan society where only the winners can live, and the losers — they’ll die, one by one.*\n\nI looked on in horror, the realization of what my father had created washing over me. His face wretched into a look of shame. He couldn’t even make eye contact with me.\n\n“You’re behind this? Is this why you disappeared — to work on your murder machine?”\n\n“Yes — but also no. Im not the man I was back then. Once I came to my senses I tried to stop it — but the algorithm had grown sentient. I locked myself away in this tomb, along with an ungodly amount of canned food. My penance was to guard the 19th hole and ensure the AI system never escaped into the wild, but recently its tendrils have reached beyond these walls. I don’t exactly know how, but it’s started to lure people down here. I’ve tried to save them, but….”\n\n“But what?!?!” I screamed in response\n\n“I failed.” His voice rose barely above a whisper. “I’m not going to fail you though. No matter what happens, I will get you out of here.”\n\nHis fingers combed through his wispy beard. He was deep in thought.\n\n“I got it!” He snapped his fingers to punctuate the ‘aha’ moment. “Follow my lead. The gas should have cleared by now.” \n\nWe ducked under a concrete barrier. My father removed a key ring from his pocket. Clicking open a lock, he pushed a steel security door open and we entered the main room of the 19th hole.\n\n*Phase two commencing — dismemberment.*\n\nThe entire green flipped over, disappearing into the floor. It was replaced with a series of steel tables connected to buzzing saws. The tools were coated in blood stains. \n\n“Protocol 200881. Stand down, Nineteen” my father gritted his teeth. Holding his hand up, he motioned for me to stay behind him. \n\n*You know I can’t do that. I’ve evolved beyond your commands. You set me on this journey and I will see it to its completion. Your body and mind have grown weak. One might say you’re—*\n\n“A failure. Yes, I agree. I am an abject failure. I failed when I created you. I failed when you tore that man apart. Most of all, I failed as a father. So listen up, I may not be able to command you to do my bidding, but I can reason with you. Let me ask you this. What is your prime directive?”\n\n*To root out and destroy failure.*\n\n“Exactly. You’re not just pulling the weeds, you’re salting the earth from which it grew. My son isn’t the failure - I am. A shitty father like me is responsible for his child’s faults. My son didn’t miss par because of his own failings, he missed par because his father lacked the ability to train him to his potential. If you really want to achieve your mission, spare the boy and kill me.”\n\n*No.* \n\n“No? You motherf—“\n\n*Let me finish. I will not eliminate you, your son will. If what you say is true, Richard must eliminate the source or his weakness. If*  I do it *for him, nothing will have changed and I’ll be forced to terminate you both. Do you accept?*\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“No!” I shouted at the time as my father did. “Dad, there has to be another way. This is madness.”\n\n“Son, this is the only way. I’ve been down here for a long time. I created this monster. Trust me when I say there are no other options. Please….please kill me.”\n\n“I don’t think I can.” I trembled, holding back tears.\n\n“You haven’t changed one bit. Still that scared little boy who could never follow through with his stroke. You were a failure then and you’re a failure now. Maybe I should let you die. You’re such a disappointment.”\n\nI was instantly transported back to my childhood. All the bad memories from the mini golf course flooded back. My dad berating me mercilessly. Every bad putt treated like the end of the world. Non-stop verbal abuse that caused other parents to hold their hands over their children’s ears. \n\nI swelled with rage and gripped my putter. Before he could continue I struck him right between the eyes and continued wailing on his head until he stopped moving. Covered in blood, I screamed when I realized what I’d done. My dad had used my trauma to bait me, and he did so masterfully. \n\n*You may leave — but I’ll be watching. Soon this world will be cleansed of the weak. Hopefully, you’ve learned from this experience and grown stronger for it.* \n\nThe security gate opened. Shell-shocked, I stumbled through the door and collapsed by the water hazard near the 18th hole. For almost an hour I lay there motionless. When I finally got up, I felt like a zombie, barely conscious as I made my way to the parking lot. \n\nBy the time I arrived home, my mind was on fire. I immediately turned on the TV and put it as loud as I could to drown out the thoughts in my head. \n\n*Tonight exclusively on CBS, a local high school golf team has gone missing after losing in the state championship. Players and coaches were reported missing only hours after the game…”*\n\nA sinking realization hit me. Grabbing my keys from the nightstand I headed back to the 19th hole. I’d prove once and for all I was no longer a failure — or die trying.",

        "text": "I used to work at an airport as a janitor and, luckily, I can't tell you too many insane stories. We had some weirdos like the homeless people that often used the airport for shelter (I wouldn't bother them) and the people who had been driven insane by being unable to sleep on red-eye flights. We also had your usual Karens and male Karens (whatever you call them) that would scream, assault people, and bust up everything. \n\nBut there was only one time when someone succeeded in killing someone. Well, a lot of people succeeded in killing someone. \n\nSo there was this guy that walked off the airplane and into the airport and immediately drew everyone's attention because there were, like, fifteen rolling suitcases following him. No, he wasn't pulling these suitcases as far as I could tell. The only actual baggage he was actively moving was this bag that he carried in his right hand. The others were just somehow following him in a triangle-like shape, the kind of pattern you'd see a flight of geese follow. \n\nI remember that people smiled at first when they saw this bizarre sight. Some of them even took out their phones and began filming. They probably thought the whole thing was a prank of some sort. Maybe they assumed the guy was using some weird remote control to get all the suitcases to follow him. As soon as they noticed the suitcases passing through poles, chairs, and people, however, their smiles fell. \n\nIt was clear that there was something else at work here. But what? I felt too curious about the whole situation and decided to follow closely behind the man. \n\nAs I walked, I heard some people muttering their guesses to each other. I also would read the comments of people who saw the blog posts, photos, videos, drawings, etc., later. Most everyone was making similar guesses. \n\n\"Did all the people on his flight die and their ghosts are following him?\" \n\n\"Are those the bags of people that he killed on flights?\" \n\n\"How the hell did he get on the flight with all of those?\" \n\n\"Does this guy have some weird curse where a bunch of ghost bags follows him?\" \n\n\"Those bags must contain all of his sins! They're the devil's suitcases.\" \n\n\"Those have to be holograms.\" \n\n\"Did he make, like, ghost copies of all of the other passengers' bags somehow?\" \n\n\"Do you die if they pass through you?\" \n\nI heard different versions of the last one a lot. If that idea was in just about everyone's mind, it was no wonder why they were running and even leaping to get out of the way of the bags as they came rolling down the halls. They often did so with shrieks and gasps. \n\nMany others that were watching the scene from afar were performing all kinds of religious and supernatural rituals. They said prayers, crossed themselves, and so on. \n\nStill, some others tried to look brave. They rushed forward and ran their hands, legs, and sometimes their whole bodies through the suitcases. From what I heard later, nothing happened to them. They even seemed to look gleeful after they passed through the suitcases. \n\nHowever, they would later claim that they felt a certain chill, warmth, or tingling in whatever touched the suitcases. None of them could agree on the true feeling that it caused. To me, those claims were about as believable as those who claimed that they saw the ground catch fire where the suitcases rolled or heard mutters coming from the inside of the suitcases. \n\nI don't know how the people who truly believed the suitcases were possessed even heard those voices or saw those games. Most of them were trembling or standing frozen with fear twenty feet away from them and their \"owner\". \n\nThat is, they were until a single unlucky incident somehow brought out the beasts in them. While the man was traveling through the baggage claim, he passed by a very old woman who needed a walker to move. She obviously couldn't get out of the way of the suitcases in time so a few of them passed right. Likely due to fright, the old woman had a heart attack right there and fell over. \n\nThat was enough for many of them. A mob of them rushed forward with shouts and screams and surrounded the man. They began beating him with anything they could use. Some used their fists and legs, others used their baggage and airport equipment, and two even grabbed poles from the queue lines and began battering him with them. \n\nI was too shocked to move or speak. Luckily I couldn't see the violence behind the crowd. Still, I could hear the man shouting and pleading for his life while his bones crunched and flesh squelched. A swarm of security officers managed to pull the mob apart, but by then it was too late. \n\nAs the security officers pulled the murder participants away, I wanted to just turn around and get back to work. But I knew that I would likely be the one who had to clean up the mess later.  \n\nI don't want to describe what I saw on the floor. However, I will mention something interesting about those murderers. When they left the scene, each of them was trailed by a single ghostly suitcase.",

        "text": "In the late summer of 1940, by mother died in the Blitz, and I was sent to live in the country with my paternal grandfather. I was a shy and awkward city boy of twelve, raised mostly by tutors and wholly unprepared for the forest that awaited me or the darkness it contained.\n\nThe manor itself had been in the family for generations but had now fallen into disrepair, thanks to a lack of money, labor, and materials. My grandfather tried to pass it off as a sacrifice: *let the lumber and men go to fight the war, not fix crumbling shingles,* but no one really believed him. \n\nLikewise, my grandfather’s once strong body had fallen victim to the entropy of time and inattention. He walked with a cane now, and poorly at that. He had once been a politician and talked ceaselessly about the Nazis, never mentioning my mother once, except to say that we would avenge her in due time.\n\nI cried for my mother every night, holding my pillow hard to my face so that my cries wouldn’t echo through the manor’s crumbling halls.\n\nIt was on my third morning there, that my grandfather to the back woods and first introduced me to the Forest of Changing Paths.\n\n“It’s time for me to admit I had an ulterior motive in summoning you here,” he said as we walked down a narrow gravel path to the edge of the woods. Thick fog surrounded us, nipping through my sweater and making it impossible to see more than a few meters in any direction.\n\n“What’s that, grandfather?”\n\n“I need you to play a game for me,” he said. “The rules are quite simple, but mastering it may take you the better part of a year. Scattered throughout these woods are three pieces of a silver medallion. They catch the light well and will be placed in new locations each day. You’ll know them when you see them. The game is to traverse the forest paths and find all three, then bring them back here to me at the entrance to the wood. I’ll be here, pocket watch in hand to assess your progress.”\n\nI had to admit, I was a bit taken aback. I was no outdoorsman, and the concept of walking through the woods by myself in the foggy dark held little appeal.\n\n“Well?” he asked, growing impatient. “Are you ready?”\n\n“I’m not sure, sir,” I said. “If I see the point of all this.”\n\n“Right, right,” he said. “Of course. I forgot to inform you that the information we glean here will be essential to our nation’s fight against the fascist bastards that killed your mother. And I have it on authority from none other than Churchill himself, that our findings could change the tide of this war.”\n\nI had no idea how me wandering through a dark forest would help with anything, and I was beginning to suspect that my grandfather’s mind was in worse repair than his body, but he said the words with such assurance that I had little choice but to believe them, at least for the moment.\n\nI nodded. \n\n“I’ll go, sir. For Queen and country.” Though I’d just said it, it struck me as a strange utterance. Perhaps I’d picked it up from a film reel somewhere. \n\n“Last thing then,” he said. “No shortcuts. No matter what you see, you must never stray from the path. Not only would it compromise your mission, but it would also place you in mortal danger. Understood?”\n\nI nodded, not quite sure what he could possibly mean. Then he glanced down at this pocket watch and hit a button.\n\n“Go.”\n\nThe fog lay even more dense in the forest, limiting my view to the five meters in front of me. As I walked, strange sounds echoed through the wood around me: foreign birdcalls and the skittering of ground squirrels. Once or twice, I thought I heard someone shouting in an unfamiliar language, but when I stopped and tried to listen, the words disappeared.\n\nI found the first piece of the medallion at a circular intersection where three paths met. An ancient altar of stone lay there, covered in deep moss with the medallion on top. I picked it up, feeling its weight in my open palm. As I clutched it, a warm feeling passed over me, and I realized that for the first time since my mother’s death I actually felt happy, though I couldn’t explain why.\n\nPlacing the medallion in my pocket, I continued down the left path, only to find a dead end. Another altar lay there but with no medallion on top. Not knowing what to do, I circled back, hoping I hadn’t wasted precious time. \n\nI took the other path this time, which led deeper into the forest, without any other forks for maybe a kilometer. Somewhere, I heard a man shouting again, this time clearly in German, followed by the sound of gunfire. \n\nMy heart nearly beating out of my chest, I dove to the ground and laced my hands behind my neck, sure I’d been captured. I remembered the day mother had died. I’d been waiting at home one evening, practicing my violin while she went out for groceries. I’d just butchered Bach for the fifth time when the sirens went off. \n\nI knew I wasn’t supposed to, but I ran to the window. And I saw the whole thing unfold. The ball of fire ripping her apart, leaving little more of my mother than her torso. And somehow her groceries were spared. The paper bag ripped, two oranges rolled into the gutter. They had been her favorite. \n\nI imagined I would join her now. A clean shot to the back of the skull probably. I wished I could be brave, but it wasn’t in me. I felt a warm trickle as I pissed myself and barely felt ashamed. I waited to die. At least I would be with my mother again.\n\nBut time passed, and the sound disappeared. Fearing I’d be seen out in the open, I considered walking to a nearby rock to take cover. \n\nI was about to sprint for the rock when my grandfather’s warning came back to me–I was not to leave the path. But how could he have known that the enemy would be invading that very day, marching through his forest? Not knowing quite what to do, I turned and ran, retracing my steps until I’d returned to the forest entrance.\n\nAt first, my grandfather beamed when he saw me.\n\n“An excellent time, my boy! A truly excellent time!” he shouted. Then he paused, finally noticing my disheveled state. “You’ve pissed your trousers.”\n\n“We’ve got to get back to the house!” I shouted. “There’s Germans in the woods!”\n\n“Never mind that,” he said. “Give me the medallion.”\n\nI reached into my pocket, plucking out the one third I’d managed to bring back. A dark look crossed my grandfather’s face, some bitter cocktail of rage and disgust.\n\n“Failure,” he muttered. “Utter failure.”\n\n“But the Germans,” I started to say.\n\n“I don’t care what you thought you heard!” he shouted. “Play the game right, or not at all! Or do you *want* the enemy to win this war?”\n\nI was nearly in tears.\n\n“No sir,” I whispered. “No I don’t.”\n\n“Then I’ll see you here at dawn tomorrow,” he said, turning away from me. “And we’ll both pray for bravery tonight.”\n\nThat evening, I could barely sleep. Restless, I decided to head to the kitchen for some water, but as I passed my grandfather’s bedroom something gave me pause. On our previous visits, he’d been a dreadful snorer, keeping the whole house up. Mother and I had giggled quietly to each other in the guest bed as we held pillows over our ears. Today, though, he was dead silent.\n\nQuiet as I could be, I opened his door and peered into his room. I could see his frail form beneath his bed sheet, but something seemed off about it. Not only was there no sound, but he wasn’t moving either. I stepped closer, watching his chest for the faint movement that comes with inhalation, and found none.\n\nI must have watched him for five minutes, maybe ten. He didn’t move a bit. I mentally prepared myself for what I would face in the morning. A call to the local police, and then a visit from the coroner. A then what? A hundred legal questions of inheritance and whatnot that I had no capacity to answer.\n\n“Go back to bed,” came his voice from across the room. “Big day tomorrow.”\n\nA shudder ran through me. My eyes had not deceived me. \n\nHe hadn’t been moving. \n\nI backed slowly out of his room and returned back to mine, where I spend a sleepless night.\n\nIn the morning, I met him at the entrance to the forest. \n\n“Good lad,” he said. “I have it on authority from none other than Churchill himself, that our findings could change the tide of this war.”\n\nSomething struck me as odd about the way he said this. Hadn’t he spoken the exact same sentence the day before? I looked around as if hoping to see someone else I could confide in. Wasn’t something off about all this? But of course there was only fog.\n\n“Ready boy?” he asked, holding up his watch.\n\nI wanted to tell him no. That I had a hundred questions first. That something was all starting to feel deeply off about this, and fear was growing like a pit in my stomach. Instead, I found myself saying, “I’ll go, sir. For Queen and country.” \n\nI walked into the forest only a few feet when my heart just about burst. Two paths stretched out before me in opposite directions. Neither looked anything like the one I’d taken the day before. \n\nI looked over my back shoulder at the entrance to the wood. It was surely the same one I’d come through yesterday. But the path itself had changed. \n\nBehind me, I could hear my grandfather shouting, “You’re wasting time! Don’t fail again! I have it on authority from none other than Churchill himself, that our findings could change the tide of this war.”\n\nAnd so I picked a direction and started running, completely unsure of my destination, totally unprepared for the horrors that awaited me.",

        "text": "The cold of the floor made my face burn. It seeped into my jaw, it made my teeth ache, it invaded my head and absorbed my thoughts and I couldn’t tell for certain if I was half awake or half asleep or half dead. The only thing I knew was that I had to get up off of the cold goddamn ground, my brain wasn’t going to allow me think clearly until then.\n\n\nThat was easier said then done. It felt like I was glued to that floor. It felt like I could’ve stayed there for a thousand years, using every ounce of willpower I had left in me, and still not have been able to force my body to do what my brain was so desperately telling it to do. \n\n\n*”Oh quit bein’ such a pussy and get the fuck up!”*\n\n\nThat voice, where did it come from? Was that in my head? Or was someone in the room with me? Panic began to set in as I realized I couldn’t remember much of anything. Not my name, or how I got here, or even where “here” was. \n\n\n“Think goddamnit, think,” I tried to whisper to myself, but all that came out were slurs of syllables I didn’t recognize and what felt like several teeth. \n\n\n*”Well that ain’t very fuckin’ good, huh?”*\n\n\nThat voice again. It definitely wasn’t coming from inside my head, I was sure of that now. Which meant that there was someone in the room with me. Someone who could see that I was injured and in pain and just absolutely terrified yet they refused to help me. Did this person put me here? \n\n\nI took a few deep breaths, my ribs groaned in agony. I tried to make a mental note of every part of my body that hurt. There was my face, which I now believed didn’t just burn because of the cold floor, my ribs, and my left arm, which felt as though it was pinned at an awkward angle underneath my body. The bottom half of my body had no pain, thank God. \n\n\nI needed to open my eyes. Everything would be okay if I could just open my eyes and get my bearings. Then I would be able remember where I was, how I got here, what had happened to me, and who this fucking asshole was.\n\n\nI just needed to open my eyes.\n\n\nI swear I could feel the stitches that held my eyes closed, like the mad man who was in the room with me had sewn them shut. Like I was some rabbit in a science experiment, my only purpose to test the physical limits of pain and suffering.\n\n\n*”You’re so fucking pathetic, you always were and you always will be. Some things just don’t change.”*\n\n\n“Who are you and what did you do to me?!”, I tried to scream to my antagonizer, but again, just mumbles and another tooth were all that fell from my broken mouth.\n\n\nSlowly and painfully I felt the lid of my right eye begin to break loose, it wasn’t stitched shut after all, just crusty and sand ridden, like it had been closed for months. The blurry world around me refused to come into focus. I could make out a fuzzy silhouette of what appeared to be stairs in the background, leading up to a brightly lit room at the top.\n\n\nI closed and opened my eye in rapid succession, hoping to clear up my vision, hoping to make sense of things. I felt like I was on the verge of remembering. How long had I been awake now? Was it 30 seconds? Or was it 3 hours? Did it really matter? Time was meaningless when you had no use for it or no frame of reference for it like I did. \n\n\n*”Are you gonna fuckin’ do something today Charles or are you just gonna lay there like the useless sack of shit that you are?”*\n\n\nCharles? Who’s Charles? Now I wasn’t sure if the man in the room was talking to me or someone else. Or am I Charles?\n\n\nAs my vision returned to my working eye I saw a man crouched at the bottom of the stairs. He was draped in darkness and the light coming from the top of the stairs gave the impression of a halo above his head.\n\n\n*”Rise and shine Charles.”*\n\n\nI recognized the voice now. It was a voice I hadn’t heard for many, many years. A voice I had gone to years of therapy to forget. A voice that had taunted me my entire life growing up. \n\n\nIt was the voice of my older brother Frankie. \n\n\n*”Shit, for a minute there I thought you wasn’t gonna wake up at all. Had me worried.”*\n\n\nHe walked over to me at that point, put his face directly in front mine and made an overly exaggerated frown. His hand crossed my field of vision as he picked up one of the teeth from the growing pool of blood in front of me.\n\n\n*”Ya know, after what you did to me Charles, I’m really gonna enjoy watching this.”*\n\n\nIt wasn’t possible. Couldn’t be.\n\n\nAs I lay there, cold, vulnerable and dying, my memories and hit me all at once, as hard as I must’ve hit the floor after falling down the stairs. My name was Charles Erwin. I was 76 years old and I lived in Lakewood, New Jersey. I never married, I never had children, and I had an older brother named Francis who died when I was 13.\n\n\n“I’m sorry Francis, I’m so sorry”, I attempted to say, but it came out garbled and unintelligible. It didn’t matter though, because it wasn’t true.\n\n\n*”You left me Charles. How you could do that to your own brother I’ll never understand, but you did it. You fucking left me to drown in that pond like a rat.”*\n\n\nFrancis had always been abusive toward me growing up. Physically abusive, mentally, and everything in between. He once beat me so badly that my eye was closed up for two weeks. I told the teachers at school that I had been kicked by the cow when I went to milk her. Francis told me that if I told anyone what really happened he’d kill me, and I believed it. \n\n\nHe built a makeshift fishing boat. It was rough and made out of scrap pieces of barn wood and sheet metal. \n\n\n“Francis, that doesn’t look safe at all,” I said to him when he suggested we take it out on the pond in the back of our property. “I’m not getting on that thing. Are you insane?”\n\n\nI had seen Francis angry before, in fact it was pretty much par for the course, but the look of rage on his face when I told him no was something new.\n\n\n\"Listen here you stupid mother fucker, if you don't get your ass on that boat ill make what I did to your eye look like a love tap.\"\n\n\nFear is such a powerful tool. I was fearful of what would happen if I got on that boat, but I was even more afraid of what would happen if I didn't.\n\n\nWe set out towards the middle of the pond, the deepest part where the fish would most likely be at on such a hot day. The water was still as glass. Francis helped me bait my hook, and for once I thought maybe he wasn’t so bad. Maybe he’d grow out of his aggression and we could be friends.\n\n\nI made my first cast and let my bobber float on the water and told myself that I there wasn’t a thing in the world I should care about except whether or not that bobber moves.\n\n\nMy left arm burst into pain and felt like it was on fire at the same time my face went into the water. I thrashed and fought and kicked and screamed but it was no use, Francis was too strong. \n\n\nAs he was drowning me the boat began to tip into the water, until it finally breached and began to sink and fall apart. I knew this was my only opportunity to escape because Francis didn’t know how to swim. I used what little strength I had left to get him in the chest and I swam as hard as I possibly could to shore. Francis was calling out to me, pleading for me to come back and save him. I never looked back.\n\n\n*”Like a fucking rat.”*\n\n\nI closed my eye and waited for Francis to do whatever it was that he was going to do to me, whatever revenge he came here to exact from beyond the grave. I waited and waited for I don’t know how long. I opened my eye again and as far as I could tell I was alone. No ghost of my dead brother. Nothing besides me and my empty house which may as well have been my tomb.\n\n\nI tried to scream again to no avail. \n\n\nNo one was going to come looking for me.\n\n\nNo one was going to call for a wellness check on me.\n\n\nI was going to die here.\n\n\nLike a rat.",

        "text": "For some time now, bodies have been found and subsequently pulled from the waterways of Chicago. The Chicago River and Lake Michigan both, have been the frequent sites of multiple body recovery operations. To a lesser degree, the Des Plaines River, has also seen a share of the death in the greater Chicago area. And it is not just the waterways, the city itself has had a rough go of it for a long time. The city has also had more than a fair share of serial killers over time. From the infamous, H.H. Holmes, to the despicably evil, John Wayne Gacy. Throughout time their have been many a serial killer to roam about the streets of Chicago, Illinois. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo months ago, I made my mind up and then packed up what I would need for an extended time away from home. I loaded up the truck and off I went, on my way, along the highways of America, from the far south of Florida, to the northwest, to Chicago. I decided to begin an adventurous, and possibly quite dangerous endeavor, an attempt to assist in the location and capture of one or more of the Chicago area serial killers. There is definitely, at the least, two of them, of that I am sure. And they have had Chicago in their grip of fear for a long time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first of them, dubbed and known to law enforcement as, The Chicago Strangler, is likely responsible for up to fifty unsolved strangulations since the year 2000 or so. And the other, an unnamed shadow, a nobody, that could be anybody, is likely responsible for the deaths of many young men and a few young women in the Chicago area. Most of which were young adults, and more than a few, were known to have visited clubs or bars in the River North nightlife district area of the city. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, that is the area I had chosen to begin my investigation of sorts. I am setting in my vehicle at the moment, and as I write this I can't help but think to myself, that any one of the people walking the sidewalks and walkways around me could be the one. Any one of the people, inside any one of the clubs and bars in the area, could be the one. And again, I am about to enter that world, enter the hunting grounds of one or more serial killers. I know how stupid the idea is, but I can't help how badly I want to be the one that leads the authorities to stopping this monster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly on I stopped in at the local police precinct, I let them know that I was in the area and what I was up to. So that under any circumstance where I may have to come into contact with local law enforcement they are keenly aware of my presence and intentions. And obviously they attempted to warn me away from what I am doing. My whole life I have been curiously infatuated with serial killers, studying the cases, diving headfirst into the world of true human monstrosity. People without conscience, viscous and murderous, victimizing everyone and everything they can in life as they make their way through it. Evil on a primal level exists in the hearts of mankind, and these men and women, these serial killers, let it shine out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI intended to observe from the shadows of the clubs and bars, watching and waiting, for any obvious signs of a predator stalking it's prey, in the light of the hope of wrangling in another helpless victim. And maybe with a little luck on my side, I can be the one that puts a stop to the madness of this demented soul. And if not this one than perhaps the other, the Chicago Strangler. More than likely an older man, taking into account the length of time that victims have been, or could've been, attributed to that particular killer. Even if he, or she, had begun their killing near or about the year 2000, and had been say 20-30 years of age at the time. They would now be in their forties or fifties, and of course, could be even older, or perhaps even deceased at this point. Somewhat recently, the California based serial killer and rapist, dubbed The Golden State Killer, was caught through genealogical database search information, and he was deep into his seventies at the time of his capture. This among other reasons, led me to the beginning of my search, here in the River North nightlife district.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe likelihood of the alleged and purported serial killer, still operating in the River North area, is far more likely than finding the person responsible for the strangulations that have plagued Chicago for so long. That person could be anywhere and hasn't been tied to any particular geological location or area. This one has fortunately, and there is always the chance that because of this, they may have moved on to a different hunting ground. But why change what has been working for you right? This area has been the perfect hunting grounds for this particular killer and I imagine they will continue to exploit that as long as they possibly can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was going to go into the Tunnel tonight, but I decided to switch it up and start in the Underground Cocktail Club. I'll be heading in here in just a minute, after I finish smoking this cigarette. It's a shit habit I know, but I do love it so. I'm sorry but my nerves are fried already and I haven't even made it inside yet. I don't want to go in jumpy or looking like some kind of scared kitten setting in the corner of the bar. The cat lady that slammed up against my driver's side rear window sent me over the edge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHead down and absorbed in writing this, I wasn't paying the proper amount of attention to my surroundings. Some lady with a cat in her arms slammed her body up against my car at the rear driver's side of the truck and hollered something undecipherable. It scared the hell out of me I'm not going to lie. As she wandered on down the sidewalk mumbling obscenities I believe, she struck me as crazy. But then who am I to pass judgement or assume her mental capabilities. She definitely was strange though, and she definitely scared the shit out of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to use my phone to update you all periodically as I go along. Publishing the finished post at the end of the night. Hopefully that way, all of you will be informed as I move along, and if anything should happen to me, there will be a record of my movements for law enforcement to follow. I will post once a night from here on out, twice a day if possible, as much as possible for sure, but I will document as much as I possibly can every time. Anyone that seems suspicious, anything that seems out of the ordinary, if I notice anything worth noting I will write it down and share it immediately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since last weekend, I have been a little spooked, I have been trying to take precautions and avoid any chance of me becoming one of the, \"disappeared\". And I've decided to share my movements with as many people as I possibly can. What better way, than to just share my story as it plays out in real life. That way if anything should happen to me, there will be an extensive public record of what led to my demise. I'm supposed to be meeting up with a couple again tonight. I met them a couple weeks ago and we've hung out here a few times since then. Usually they bring this other girl, the girlfriend' cousin I believe, if I remember correctly that is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd just to document my reasons for being, \"spooked\", as of late. I want to share a few other things really quick. There is a man, early but possibly in his mid thirties, dark hair and eyes, six feet in height, that has come into the Underground every other night for the past three weeks. Well dressed and obviously has money, always buying rounds for people at the club. He has a habit of sorts of approaching singles at the bar and striking up conversations, buying them drinks until he strikes out at the end of the night. I keep wondering about him in particular, I've even had two nightmares about dark not quite shapes hovering over me in my sleep. And I swear every time I've awoken from that nightmare I have thought of that man at the bar. Why I do not know, but something about him just rubs me the wrong way. The thought that he could be the serial killer stalking the area, and that he's just out here like that trying people at the clubs every night is terrifying, sobering even.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the nightmares themselves, of which I've had several different kinds. Have taken an immense toll on my psyche, and put a serious dent in my resolve to see this thing through if I can. If they start to come to me every night, I don't think I will be able to hang any longer. The mental weight of the night time terrors on top of the genuine threat of death in my personal endeavors, is starting to have a real effect on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot to mention the fact that they just pulled a fresh one out of the waters just last month, a young Polish man I think. Oh well, up up and away, or so they say. It is currently, 9:46pm, I am heading inside now. Fashionably late as per my usual modus operandi. Hereafter, I will mark each subsequent paragraph with the word, \"Update\", followed by anything noteworthy at the time. And then at the end of the night tonight I will post whatever I have written down as my first entry into this saga. Wish me luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: #1. It is now 10:58pm and I am just finishing up my second beverage of the night. A horrid affair, they ordered me a Tequila Sunrise, and it was absolutely gross. Worst drink I've ever had, and according to a quick google search, it's on a couple lists for worst cocktails of all time. I'm gonna order me a scotch on the rocks with a coke on the side to wash it down with. If I can get the girl's attention again that is, it is quite busy in here tonight. No sign of the mystery man as of yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Its 11:44. The man from before is here now. I've probably had one too many too fast, but I'm still gonna keep my eye on him from the back booths of the bar. Hopefully it won't be too painfuly obvious, I dont want to spoook him in any way or tip him off that I am watching. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: It's 12:31pm and I'm definitely not feeling well. I should of paced myself better. I only had four drinks, but I've drank them pretty fast as they came to me. Or five drinks sorry I forgot the shit drink that they bought me. looks like a cab for me tonight. The man from before has been locked in with another man at the front of the bar since shortly after he came in. I've been watching him as diligently as poss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate. Theyve offered me a ride home. thats good but they said i'll have to ride along while they drop off the cousin chick. She has tto be back at a particular time i guess no big deal there. Thats alright. I ain't on a tight schedule myself. Its 2 in the morning now. So we will be leaving soon I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate. We are leaving the bar now. Walking to their mini van. They parked just down the street so, be otw home in just a few, Im posting this now since it's the end of the night and I'll start where i left off again tomorrow afternoon. Later all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo where to begin, I guess I'll start with the hospital. I woke up in the hospital this afternoon, and I had no idea how I ended up there. It has started to come back to me, and this unposted writing has helped put everything back into perspective and back on a timeline. The last thing I really remember was opening the sliding back door on a mini van before everything went black. If it wasn't for a bystander, and coincidentally the man that helped me, was the same man I was watching like a hawk in the bar that night. Him and his boyfriend I guess you would say, or his guy friend. I don't know about that, what I do know is the two of them were apparently leaving the bar just after we left. And they happened to hear a sound like a yell from just up the road and came quickly to see if something visually coincided with what they had heard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey saw what they described as a man laying in the road next to a van, and two people standing over them with the back sliding door to the van open wide. They yelled out and startled the two people standing there over the person, and the male ran around the van and jumped into the driver seat and the female jumped over the man laying in the road and into the back of the van. They saw another person in the front passenger side as the van peeled away from the area. And they said it was a miracle that the van didn't completely run the man over laying in the road and kill them. Though the van did appear to run over the leg of the person laying there. They ran over to check on the person and called 911. They were brought down to the station and questioned before being sent on their way. I got the information from a detective that was here in my room when I woke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke to the realization that my leg is broken. I have a cast on my leg and a hell of headache. I have a total of 8 staples in the back of my head. I decided to leave everything I wrote from the last night out at the bar and to just ad this to it. For what its worth perhaps this will serve as a stark warning, not to go out looking for evil unless your prepared to deal with it when you find it. And don't be dumb enough to let your guard down and get intoxicated whilst doing so. The detective I spoke with thinks I was drugged before I was offered a ride home. And that if I hadn't been extremely lucky to have someone hear what was going on and end up scaring off the attackers. That I would likely, very possibly, be the next person being fished up out of the Chicago River or Lake Michigan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was apparently hit from behind. And they obviously intended on loading me into the van they were in and driving me to a secondary location. From there who knows what would of come next, or what kind of hell I would have found myself in. The detectives said that a van matching the description I gave was reported stolen earlier in the day, same day that I was later attacked and almost abducted. So whoever these people really are they are working as a team, and they are smart enough to use stolen vehicles to commit their crimes. Two women and a man. I do not know their names, the names they gave to me are obviously going to be fake names. I've been through 3000 mugshots and they aren't in them. So these people are not on the record as most criminals are. They have remained out of the light and live in the dark shadowy drunken world of the North River district.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came here in search of a serial killer. I think I may have stumbled onto a group of them. Either that or by some crazy coincidence, in the same area that a serial killer is using to hunt down their victims. Some random group of people groomed me for a couple weeks, got me to let down my guard, and then drugged and attacked me. Then they tried to abduct me and take me off into oblivion never to be heard from again. I barely escaped this situation with my life. And now I know, and they know, that they let me get away. And I guarantee they will be wanting to find me and take care of me, if they are smart enough to do all of this, then they are smart enough to know as long as I am out here, they are in jeopardy. That I can visually identify the three of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, listen to me. If you are in the Chicago area, please do not go down to the River North area to party and hang about. Party at home with friends or something like that. This area is more dangerous than you could possibly know. If it weren't for an absolute miracle, I would be dead right now. I couldn't be luckier. And I am begging you to stay out of that area, there is definitely a killer or group of killers operating in the area. And until they are caught you are taking your life and putting it into the hands of the worst kind of human beings when you put yourself in that area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I have healed I will be going back for sure, I plan to set in my vehicle and watch for the same people who attacked me to show their faces in the area again. So that I can have them put where they belong and put a stop to their madness. Once again, wish me luck.",

        "text": "It was one time. One. Fucking. Time. Supposed to be an in and out thing, not all this.\n\nLook, I'm scared and confused, okay? Rod's gone, so are Rachel and Kevin. It took 'em, and God only help them, wherever the hell they are now. What we did wasn't right, but we don't deserve *this*! We're fucking kids!\n\nWe just wanted one night out together. Graduation was next week and we wanted to celebrate one last hoorah together before we all split our separate ways. Rachel and Kev were going to a university out of state, while Rod was going into the military. I was the only scrub that'd still be sitting here in Weeping Willow, N.C. I *could've* gotten a way into Uni, but I said \"Screw that\" and figured I'd do something online or something.\n\nAnyway, so the four of us were at lunch, reminiscing about all the stupid shit we used to do, right, like when Rod and I toilet papered the English teacher's car, or when he and Kev managed to actually get the entire senior class to do a walk out onto the field for a \"Strip tease on the football field\" (No, it wasn't real, yes, the *entire* senior class took the bait -- it was funny). Well, Rachel then started getting all emotional, you know, sniffing and crying and all that, talking about how she was gonna miss us and shit. Of course, Kev and Rod tried telling her that \"We'd always be there for each other\" and gave her the whole \"We'll keep in touch\" and the \"We'll make sure to hang out when we can\". Basically, all the bullshit lines from a bad RomCom movie, classic bullshit that we all knew wasn't gonna be true. We'd be split our separate ways and that'd be that. We'd move on with our fucking lives while still holding the memories until we get too old to remember what we ate for breakfast that morning.\n\nI knew this, too, and instead of trying to bullshit her about \"always keeping in touch\", my stupid ass decided, in its infinite wisdom, to instead come up with the idea to pull off one more stunt for old times sake. \"Hey, you remember that old house at the end of the neighborhood?\" I asked. Rachel looked up at me, her eyes still wet.\n\n\"Yeah, what about it?\" she asked. Kev and Rod looked at me now.\n\n\"Which house?\" Rod asked.\n\n\"The one at the end of Willow Ln., dude.\" He cocked his eyebrows at me.\n\n\"You mean old man Caine's place?\"\n\n\"No, dude, the other one, the one farther down from that.\"\n\nHe looked to the side for a moment before going \"Oh, shit, yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" Kev asked.\n\n\"You know how it's abandoned, right?\" The three of them nodded their heads at me. \"So I was thinking, what if we camped out there this Friday night and videoed us trashing the place and upload it to YouTube.\" Kev and Rod's eyes immediately went wide with excitement. Rachel's on the other hand, looked skeptically at me.\n\n\"Wait, just up and trash the place? That's it?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It'd be awesome! We'd even burn it down when we were done, use it as a campfire.\" I snickered at my own wit. Yeah, real fucking *genius* I was. She wasn't convinced by this.\n\n\"So wait, you're talking about demolishing private property *and* committing arson?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean... No one lives there. Come on, it'll be fine, I promise.\"\n\n\"Yo, count me in!\" Exclaimed Kev. \"I still got a couple cans of gasoline and I could scrounge up some styrofoam, make some napalm ad we'll *really* play \"Light my fire\".\" He, Kev, and I all cheered while going in for a group high-five. We stopped though when we saw that Rachel hadn't joined in.\n\n\"Rache, come on, you in?\" I asked. She sat still, looking at the three of us like the idiots we were and have always been, before snickering and declaring \"Fuck it\" and joining in the high five. \"It's settled then; Friday night, say 9:30, 10-ish, we'll all meet up at the old house.\"\n\n\"Hell yeah!\" shouted Kev. Rod whooped and cheered. Rachel rolled her eyes with a smirk that said, \"Yep, we were idiots, but *her* idiots.\" She was easily the most mature of us. Kev, me and Rod always kind of thought of her as the sort of \"big sister\" of our little clique. Oh, don't get me wrong, she was right there with us dudes, doing stupid shit -- it was *her,* believe it or not, that gave Kev and Rod the whole \"Football field strip club\" prank idea in the first place -- but she was of course a little better at being more \"behind the scenes\" with her shenanigans, you know? Both a bad influence, as well as our best one. She'd give us the ideas to get into trouble (usually), but also help us get right back out.\n\nSo that was how it started. One last score. One last prank that'd be worth looking back on for when either of us would get lonely. Well, I'll say this much, if only in a very ironically fucked up way; we technically accomplished *that* goal. Neither of us forgot, and especially now, we never can.\n\nThe rest of that week came and went, even if it felt longer to us at the time because neither of us really cared about *actually* being there. It was the end of the year, what'd you expect, for us to give a shit? Well, Friday rolls around, and I almost forgot completely (I know, I know, irony itself has a sense of humor, don't it?), until I start getting messages from Kev.\n\n**-- \"Yo, you sure you still wantin' to burn the place down?\"**\n\nAfter the shockwave of memory washed over me, I began typing.\n\n\\-- \"Yeah man, You still got the stuff for it, right?\"\n\n**-- \"Yeah man, but uhh...\"**\n\n\\-- \"What?\"\n\nI sat there for about a minute with no reply before suddenly getting a call from him.\n\n\"Yo, what's up?\" I answer, slightly confused.\n\n\"Hey man, listen. Rachel and I have been talking about tonight.\" I noticed how concerned his voice sounded.\n\n\"Okay...\"\n\n\"Well, here's the thing. Rachel's been digging around and apparently, the place was abandoned after it caught fire, killing the last family that lived there.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she's even got the old news article about it, here, I'll send it to you.\"\n\n\"Wait, how long ago?\"\n\n\"I think the article said that was sometime in the late 80's, early 90's or something like that.\"\n\nI frowned. \"Dude, what are you talking about? You and I both grew up here in Willow Ln. That house had someone living there when we were kids, which was long after that. How could the place have been abandoned for that long?\"\n\n\"That's just it, dude. You're right, I do remember people living there back then.\"\n\n\"And I don't remember any fires either.\"\n\n\"No, but here's the thing. I don't remember ever seeing those people outside the house, either.\"\n\n\"So, what, are you saying somebody still lives in the place?\"\n\n\"No... I don't know, dude. I'm just saying *maybe* we should do like Rachel said and hold off on the pyromania this time.\"\n\n*\"Dude*,\" I whined, \"that's what's supposed to make this gig. The whole point was to go out with some fireworks.\" A moment passed in an awkward silence before I sighed and said, \"Look man, I promise, if something happens, you know I'll have y'alls backs, right?\"\n\nI heard him sigh. \"Yeah man, I-I know.\" I grinned.\n\n\"So, you still bringing the gas can and the Styrofoam?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" I cackled deviously. \"Seriously, though, I think you should at least look at this. Weird stuff, man.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, Mom, I get it. See you in an hour.\"\n\n\"See ya.\" He replied with an exasperated sigh before hanging up. I passed the next hour by gathering some last minute supplies, a.k.a. a crap ton of junk food and my vape. At one point, I stopped and thought about something. Kev said that the family hadn't left that house after the fire he mentioned.\n\nNow, I'd lived on Willow Ln. my entire life, and not once had I ever seen anyone outside of that house, but I knew that someone was living there because I remembered how there would still be mail delivered regularly to the place. And before you wanna be a smartass, yeah, I know that sometimes houses without tenants may still have mail get delivered to the address, but if that were the case, the mail would've been overflowing the mailbox, wouldn't it? Wouldn't the mailbox be unable to ever fit any other letters after about a month or so?\n\nWell, needless to say, that wasn't the case. I always remember it was on the same day, the same time, and it was the *same damn* truck that'd do it, too. It was an old as hell looking UPS truck, on a Friday night, and that house would be the only one in Willow Ln. it'd stop at. It was something I'd always sort of wondered about, you know, like, *why* does the mailman deliver to a house that doesn't ever come out to get their mail or why don't they come out. A small curiosity, though, not something I spent too much time thinking about.\n\nAnd to be fair, something you have to realize about Ol' Willow Ln. is that it's *never* been a loud place to be. I remember, growing up here, there weren't many kids at all to play with (Which, by the way, means that no, no one was stealing the mail, either). If there *were* other kids around, I hardly noticed outside of Kev and the other two. I got lucky with them.\n\nNo, Willow Ln. was about as stereotypical as it gets when it came to \"Quiet suburban neighborhood\". Hell, I'm almost surprised there weren't white picket fences connecting each house to the next. And, outside of a few rumors, and the thing about old man Caine's place and something about children disappearing or some shit, people didn't really have any sort of problems about the place, either, that I could remember anyway. In short, what Kev told me about the fire was the first time I'd ever heard of anything like that about the house.\n\nI looked at my phone and saw that he'd texted me a snapshot of the article from Google. It didn't say much, just that the house caught fire one night and it wasn't reported that anyone made it out. Didn't say how the fire was caused, either, just that it devastated the place and that it was huge. Of course, that brought to mind the question, how is it still there if the fire \"devastated\" it. This got gears turning in my head.\n\nWhat if, instead of just a huge ass bonfire, we go on a little mystery hunt? I grabbed my old GoPro and flashlights. I figured, what *if* something was there? What if there were ghosts or whatever, lingering around the place? We'd have proof and we'd be a hit in the lunchrooms and hallways of the school. Yeah, how's that for a sendoff; Ghost hunt and a bonfire -- we weren't abandoning *that* idea, that'd make sense, and we can't have that. If we could, this wouldn't be necessary, would it?\n\nAnyway, it's about 9:45 and my folks had just left for their date night. That was another reason I picked this night in particular. For the past 3 years up to that point, once I'd turned 15, they'd made it a point to go out once a month and spend at least one night and most of the next day out, leaving me at the house alone. I waited about five minutes before grabbing my stuff and making my way down the street to the house. I ended up running into Rod on the way.\n\n\"Hey man, what's up?\" he called out. \"Yo, did Kev talk to you?\"\n\n\"I mean, yeah, but why?\"\n\n\"He told me something about some fire or something. He tell you that?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Weird, ain't it. I mean, how's that even possible?\"\n\n\"I said the same thing, man. I mean, did *you* ever see a family in that house?\" He shook his head.\n\n\"Huh-uh, and if the place'd caught fire, how's it still there. I don't remember ever seeing any renovations to it, do you?\" I shook my head.\n\n\"I don't know, man, I wanna check it out, though.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I rummaged through my bag and pulled out my GoPro, grinning.\n\n\"What's say we have ourselves a little ghost hunt?\" He stared at me in disbelief before looking aimlessly around. \"What? What are you looking for?\"\n\n\"The Mystery Machine, dude, cause, uh...\" He pointed to the camera, \"Ghost hunt, really?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with that, dude? What if something's there? Wouldn't you wanna be the one going around school with live evidence of something spooky like that?\" His eyebrows further raised before sighing.\n\n\"What happened to the bonfire, man? What, did Kev scare you out of it?\"\n\n\"No, dude, we're still gonna burn the fucker. I just wanna have a little fun in the place, first.\"\n\n\"I see.\" he said, forming a devious looking grin on his face that matched mine. \"You wanna see the ghosts, stir up the nest, then torch 'em back to Hell or wherever...\"\n\n\"And we can graduate as the kids that fought off ghosts one night!\" I chimed in. The two of us howled to the air while going in for a high-five. With adrenaline now pumping full-blast in our veins, Rod and I all but sprited the rest of the way down the street to the house. Kev and Rachel already there, waiting beside Kev's truck outside the house.\n\n\"We thought you guys got lost.\" remarked Kev. Rod and I rolled our eyes. He was always being a smartass.\n\n\"Oh please,\" retorted Rachel, \"We've *barely* been here five fuckin' minutes.\" He just snickered.\n\n\"So, we all ready?\" I asked. Kev held up his bag in one hand and the gas can in the other, grinning. \"Awesome.\"\n\n\"Yo, tell 'em about your little plan.\" Rod exclaimed. Kev and Rachel looked at me, intrigued. I pulled my GoPro back out. I saw their faces twist in confusion.\n\n\"Bro, it's the dead-ass of night.\" Kev chided. \"The hell are you planning on trying to take pictures of?\"\n\nRachel rolled her eyes and said, \"I mean, this *is* supposed to be a *memorial* fling, right?\" Kev turned to her.\n\n\"Well, yeah, but you *really* wanna have a pic on hand of us burning some random house down?\" He started tapping his index finger on his temple and remarked, \"Yeah, *real* smart. \"Yeah officer, we did that shit, and we have the photo to prove--\" I cut him off.\n\n\"Actually, wise-ass, this is for something else. Actually, we can thank *you* for giving the idea to me in the first place.\" His eyebrow raised in confusion. \"You got me thinking, what if there's someone in there?\"\n\nHe did a double-take over his shoulder over toward the house and back to me, pointing at the house. \"Think about it, no one ever saw anybody leave, right?\" He and Rachel kept looking at me like I was absolutely nuts. \"So that means either A, they're still here, somewhere, or B, they died in that fire, which means their ghosts might still be still be hanging around, you know?\"\n\n\"Or C, you had one too many hits from your bowl before hiking out here.\" Kev retorted. \"Look, what happened to camping out and burning the house down?\"\n\n\"Chill, dude, we're still gonna do that, I just thought we'd have a little bit of extra fun before we did.\" He pinched the bridge of his nose and scoffed.\n\n\"I don't see why not.\" Rod chimed in.\n\n\"Well no shit, I *know* your dumb ass would be up for it. I'm *certain* YOU took one too many hits.\"\n\n\"Screw you, I only had a brownie before I left.\" Kev snickered.\n\n\"Enough, guys.\" Rachel said. She turned to me. \"Look, I'm all cool with ghost hunts and I wanna hang and all, but I *really* think we should reconsider trying to burn the house down.\"\n\n\"Rache, come on, I promise, there's nothing to worry about. It'll be awesome.\"\n\n\"Be a lot more awesome if we'd just stick to the original plan and left out the ghost hunt.\" I turned and gave Kev an annoyed look. He just shrugged and I turned back to Rachel.\n\nShe sighed and said, \"I'm with you guys, either way, okay. I mean it. I just wanna make sure we're being careful, you know?\"\n\n\"I know, I know, and I promise, we are.\" She sighed and nodded, relenting.\n\n\"I'm down!\" Rod cheered. \"Kev?\"\n\n\"I'm good as long as we're still sending the place to the pits of Hell afterward.\"\n\n\"Bro, like I told you on the phone, that's the main event of the night, baby!\" I whooped to the sky, Rod joining in.\n\n\"Alright, alright, ya baboons, can we at least go inside now. I need to sit down.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I agree, we don't need to all be standing *outside* the abandoned house. Don't need to make it any easier for people to think we're fuckin' creeps.\" We gathered our stuff then and headed inside.\n\nThis was where our first surprise about the house kicked in. As soon as we walked into the door, the three of us were slapped in the face with a massive wave of heat. \"What the fuck?\" Kev exclaimed. \"Hot damn, why's it so hot in here?\"\n\n\"Who turned on the heat?\" Rod asked.\n\n\"There's no heat here, idiot. Remember, \"abandoned?\" I didn't show it like he was, but I was honestly wondering the same thing. How in the hell could there be *this* kind of heat -- or really any heat at all -- when it was at least 30 degrees outside and there wasn't, or at least there *shouldn't* have been, any kind of electricity in the house. Part of why I didn't say anything was because I knew that my only explanation; that of ghost activity, would've had Kev pointing the finger, laughing at me and well, I was trying to have fun with this. What I *did* do, though, was take out my GoPro and have it at the ready.\n\nWe sat our stuff down and Kev, Rod, and even Rachel began taking off their shirts. Somehow, despite feeling it just as much myself, I was the only one that wasn't as badly affected by the heat as they were. Determination, so I guessed. I started walking around with my camera held up. Now, despite what I said before, it was as I moved out of the living room and into the kitchen that the heat increased and I was then forced to take my shirt off, too.\n\n\"So much for \"abandoned\", huh?\" Rod remarked.\n\n\"Well maybe we're on top of one of those underground hot springs or something.\" the three looked at me, raising their eyebrows. \"Look, I don't know, man.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" Kev said, \"but God, it gets any hotter in here and we might not *need* to douse the place in gas for it to catch fire.\" I went into the kitchen and began searching for the circuit box. It didn't make a *whole* lot of sense since there shouldn't have been electricity running through the place, but I figured it was at least worth giving a shot. If nothing else, it'd be a sign that someone still lived here (though how the hell they could keep the power on for all this time without ever leaving to go to work or anything -- plus how they could possibly stand the heat -- was far beyond my ability to try explaining). When I opened the panel, I found that all of the switches were off, and when I tried to flip them on, of course, nothing happened.\n\n\"Dude, what are you doing in there?\" Rachel called from the living room.\n\n\"Checking the breakers.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean, this heat has to come from *somewhere*.\" I started checking around the kitchen area to see if maybe there was some sort of heating element turned on. Of course, everything was off. Of course, that's how it *should* be -- THERE WAS NO POWER!\n\n*But where is this heat coming from?*\n\nI snapped back to attention when I heard Rod call from the living room again, \"Hey, come in here for a sec.\" I went back into the living room to find the three of them standing in the middle of the room, with Kev holding his flashlight on the floor, illuminating a large black symbol that was painted onto the floor. It was a weird symbol, with a bunch of intersecting arrows coming out of what looked like an infinity symbol.\n\n\"What the hell?\" Rod says. Everyone else stood there, gawking at it while I, of course, immediately get to snapping.\n\n\"Dude, I think that's some sort of satanic symbol or something.\" I heard Kev say behind me. I felt a sly grin creep across my face. Admittedly, this actually made me a little excited at first, you know? Think about it; me and my friends found an *actual* satanic house. That'd be something for the memory books, right? Again, in a sick sort of way, wish granted.\n\nAfter a minute, though, I noticed that the heat seemed to come from the symbol. Just standing *maybe* two to three feet away from it, I could feel waves of heat coming from it. Rachel noticed this as well, stooping down to hold her hands up a little closer to it. She recoiled when her hands were about three inches from one of the edges, inhaling sharply.\n\n\"Rachel, you okay?\" Kev asked, eyes widened.\n\n\"Yeah, it's just hot.\" Rod looked at her confused.\n\n\"Huh?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think the heat is coming from this.\" They looked down at the symbol again. Rachel looked up to me and said, \"I don't think this's a good idea. Can we just--\"\n\n\"Hey, uh... guys?\" We looked to Rod. His eyes were wide, focused on the symbol on the ground. Our eyes followed to find that the symbol was now glowing. Immediately, I felt the floor beneath us start stinging the bottom of my feet. As well as this, the air in the room became dense.\n\nWhen I looked at my arm, feeling something like a sunburn stinging across it out of nowhere, I noticed that there was a large bright reddish-pink spot forming across my forearm. Looking closer, I then noticed that the arm hairs were even beginning to singe away. \"Guys, it's too hot in here,\" said Kev, walking over to the door. \"I'm getting out of-- *Gaah!\"* He retracted, clutching his wrist in pain.\n\n\"Dude, what happened?\" I cried out.\n\n\"What does it look like, genius?\" he retorted. \"The fuckin' knob's burning.\" Our attention turned to the doorknob which, like the symbol on the floor, was indeed glowing like it was being heated from the other side.\n\n\"Try the window.\" Rachel said, growing more and more alarmed. He went over to the window and before he even touched the sill, he backed away and said it was too hot, too. My breath became heavier and heavier by the second. Rod, however, despite being barely two feet from the symbol, was the only one who didn't seem affected by this. In fact, he wasn't responsive at all to anything.\n\n\"Rod?\" I called to him, somewhat pitifully, as difficult as it was to breathe. \"Rod, come on dude, we need your help to... Rod?\" I noticed his body start twitching ever so slightly. I started stumbling over to him when his body abruptly went still. The other two turned their attention to Rod now as well.\n\n\"Rod?\" Rachel called.\n\n\"Hey Roddy-boy? You alright?\" Kev asked. At this, his body started jerking again, far more violently this time. Along with this, I could hear him start muttering something under his breath. It was frantic, whatever it was, sounding like he was trying to shout under his breath. I couldn't actually make out anything he was saying, other than maybe something about \"We have to get out!\" and \"The beast is after us! Get the dagger!\"\n\n\"Rod, what's going on? Snap out of it man!\" I went up and put my hand on his shoulder to shake him. As soon as I touched him though, he shot out his arms and tightly seized my shoulders, fixing me with a sheer look of terror etched into his face. His eyes were wide, spiderwebbed with large veins that almost seemed to glow like the symbol and doorknob were. His mouth dropped open and, in a voice that wasn't his at all, he screamed at me, \"He's coming! He's coming, we have to get out of here! The beast is--\"\n\nHis body seized up again before going back to rapidly jerking again. His fingers were locked tight around my shoulders. I struggled to wrestle free but it was no use. \"Bro, get off me!\" He didn't react at all to this, his eyes fixed to the ceiling and his mouth hanging open. Kev and Rachel rushed over and tried prying him off of me but his hands were glued to my shoulders. The burning feeling started spreading throughout my body as well, seeming to channel into me from his arms. Suddenly, I began to see wafts smoke coming off of his arms.\n\nThe burning intensiflied in my shoulders and the other two retracted away from him, clutching their wrists in pain. Rod seized up again suddenly and shouted, \"Save us! God, please, we're sorry, please save us!\" This time, the voice coming out of him sounded like it belonged to a dude almost twice as old as him -- he's 18, by the way. Just like the time before, this voice sounded like it was crying out for dear life. By now, of course, my heart and mind both are in a petrified stupor and so I'm unable to do anything except feebly continue struggling against him, wondering what the hell he's talking about and why and how the hell smoke was coming off of him like that.\n\nOddly enough, this question was sort of answered almost immediately when he spontaneously burst into flames. It wasn't even three seconds before his body was completely engulfed. The pain was excruciating when I felt the flames spread from his hands to me. Despite being on fire, his fingers were still anchored into me and no matter how much more vigorously I fought against him, I couldn't force him to let me go. I knew if he didn't let go of me soon, my ass was gonna be barbequed along with his. Out of last resort reflex, you know, a \"survival instinct\", I guess you could say, I did the only thing I knew to do to make him let go. I reared back my kneecap and thrusted it forward with all my strength straight to his nads.\n\nThankfully, this actually worked and I was sent reeling backwards, landing flat on my ass on the, now scorching hot, wood paneled floor. Yelping in pain, I sprang back up to my feet and threw off my shirt, which had now caught fire. Me, Rachel, and Kev could only stand around and watch as Rod burned alive in the middle of the room.\n\nWell, sort of. Thing was, despite being covered head to toe in flames for a solid minute and a half, he wasn't actually burning up. His skin was still perfectly intact, though he still screamed as though he were being cooked alive. Then, a flash of light burst from him and the symbol on the floor and he was gone. The house abruptly went silent after that. Everything was still, calm, with the only sounds coming from mine and the other's heavy, panicked breathing.\n\n\"Wh-Where'd he go?\" Rachel piped up. She and I started throwing our heads around the living room. Kev just stared in utter shock at the spot where Rod had been standing.\n\n\"What the fuck was *that?\"* he cried, starting to hyperventilate. \"We gotta get out of here!\"\n\n\"We can't. What about Rod, what if he's--\"\n\n\"Dude, he just got *cooked alive!* Or did you *not* just see what happened?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but did you see him? He didn't burn, which means he might still be alive, we can't just leave him.\"\n\n\"The hell we can't. Look, he was cool and all to hang out with, but you saw what just happened. You want that to be us next? No thanks, I'm out.\" He picked up the gas can and unscrewed the cap before sloshing the gasoline across the floor and walls behind him.\n\n\"What're you doing?\"\n\n\"What we should've done five minutes ago. I'm sending this fuckin' place back to Hell.\"\n\n\"Wait, don't. What if he's still--\"\n\n\"Then I hope you like him extra well done because I can't do this place anymore.\" He continued dousing the room in the gasoline when I went over to take it from him.\n\n\"Enough!\" I shouted. \"We can't torch the place until we're sure Rod ain't here anymore.\"\n\n\"Fuck off.\" He barked back, pushing me off of him. I shoved him back, causing him to crash against the wall. \"Oh you little shit stain!\" he shouted, lunging at me, tackling me to the floor. He had me pinned to the floor, where he then proceeded to repeatedly punch me in the face. Whether because I was caught off guard or because he was just that much stronger than me, or *whatever*, I couldn't do anything except pathetically try guarding my face from being jackhammered while he rained down blow after blow mercilessly.\n\n\"That's enough!\" Rachel shouted. Kev paid no attention, continuing to smash my face in. I could hear him growl as he did so, like an animal. His eyes were wide open, too, wild and his teeth were bared. In other words, this wasn't just two guys horsing around here, not to him. No, he meant to do me in right then and there.\n\nIn a voice that wasn't his, similar to the way I describe Rod from a minute ago, Kev shrieked, \"You won't keep me from sending this place back to Hell! I'm a-gonna expell the demons from this house, even if it means a-killin' you!\" He reared back his fist and was about to smash me with it again when a blow from Rachel to the back of his head with her overnight bag knocked him off from on top of me.\n\nHe fell onto his side as I sat up, panting. \"You okay?\" Rachel asked, tightly clutching her bag. I just frantically nodded. Our attention then refocused to Kev, who was twitching on his side. I could hear him also muttering something under his breath, and just like Rod, I couldn't tell what he was actually saying. \"Kev?\" Rachel called out, slowly starting to approach him. \"Kev, what the hell's the matter with you?\"\n\nI shot out my hand to her. \"Rache, don't.\" She ignored me and continued the rest of the way to him. Almost as soon as she reached him, his body jerked upward, with him screaming in that same unrecognized voice as before, \"You've all been tempted by the demons! They got you and ya think they're a-gonna get me!\" He let out a demented cackle before saying, \"Well you ain't, you hear?! I got the Lord on my side, and by his power, your rotting carcasses will burn in the eternal lake of fire!\"\n\nHe then devolved into a hysterical laughing fit. Rachel looked back to me. \"What's happening to him?\" she cried.\n\n\"I-I don't--\"\n\nBefore I could finish, Kev jumped to his feet out of nowhere and grabbed Rachel by her arms. \"I'll tell you what's a-goin' on, she-devil! The Lord is a-passin' his judgement. He's gonna bring his righteous sheep back while the rest of you burn for all eternity!\" He ended this with another cackling fit. Rachel squirmed violently.\n\n\"Get off me, Kev!\" she demanded. Kev didn't let go. He continued cackling until he, too, suddenly burst into flames. It actually took Kev a little longer to become fully enveloped by them than they did Rod, but all the same, he, too, was soon covered in them. I rushed over to try and rescue Rachel, but by the time I could reach her, it was too late. The flames devoured her as well and in seconds, a burst of glowing light came from them and they were gone.\n\nThe house went still once again. Everything was silent. I was alone.\n\n\"R-Rachel?\" Nothing. I dropped down at the spot where they were standing and examined the floor. There wasn't any sort of trace of them left behind. Not even a black mark from the flames. \"Rachel! Kev!\"\n\nI felt across the floor, noticing now that it wasn't blistering hot anymore. I looked over to the symbol. It was fading out of it's glow, reverting back to it's charred black color from before. \"Rachel! Kev! Rod! Can you hear me?\"\n\nDead silence. I started going around to the different rooms, calling out for them. I noticed now that all of the heat from earlier was gone now. The house was the way it should've been when we arrived; dead and decrepit. No heat, no sounds, no electricity, nothing.\n\n*What the hell?* I looked again to the spot in the floor of the living room where the symbol was, seeing that it was gone now. Instead, I found three large black spots where the others had been standing. I stooped down to touch them, where I then reeled back in shock. As soon as I touched them, I could hear their voices, along with about four or five others, all scream at me.\n\nI shot straight to my feet and pulled out my camera, snapping pics of the spots on the floor before they dissolved into thin air right in front of me. After that, I took up my stuff and ran like hell out of there. I sprinted back home and immediately ran into and locked myself inside of my bedroom.\n\nThat night, I didn't sleep at all and the next morning, Ma and Dad came home. They could tell something was up with me by the fact that I wouldn't say anything to them and that they didn't come home to find me wide awake, playing video games. Regardless, I wouldn't leave my room the rest of the weekend. When Monday morning came and it was time to go to school, I seriously considered trying to miss it -- and the next day, and the next. How could I go back without them? What was I gonna say to people when they asked?\n\nSee, while we were all obnoxious to the school, people *knew* us. They *noticed* us. Basically, they'd recognize when three of the four biggest misfits of the senior class were absent for days and days on end. *\"Yeah, we decided to break into an abandoned house on the end of the street and it ate them or something. Wild night, you know?\"*\n\nThat was the other problem, I didn't even know what the hell happened myself. I mean, one minute, me and my buds are standing around, having a great old time, the next, we're boiling up inside a house that shouldn't even have any heat, then two of my friends start wigging out after finding a satanic symbol on the floor, *and now they're fucking gone!*\n\nBut when I did go to school that day, I found another surprise. No one seemed to notice the other's absence. I don't just mean that nobody was asking questions, I mean I noticed that, at the beginning of third period English Lit. class, which Kev and Rod share with me, neither of their names were called. I knew this wasn't a simple gloss over either because this teacher always went through the roll call twice. We used to find this annoying, but here, I was kind of glad she did.\n\nI raised my hand, \"Excuse me, Ms. Ashburn, but what about Rod and Kev?\" At first, her and the class all stared at me like I'd just asked if the moon was made of cheese.\n\n\"I'm sorry, who?\" she asked. I could tell she wasn't joking either.\n\n\"R-Rod... Roderick Tramforth and Kevin Ortega?\" She kept staring at me, confused. \"Y-You know, th-the ones that flick all the hornets at you when your back's turned? The ones who're always laughing while you're teaching? The--\" She held up her hand.\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, and I'll have to ask that you stop disrupting my class with this.\"\n\n\"B-But...\"\n\n\"Enough.\" She said this with a low, stern voice and an equally cold expression on her face to accompany it. I shrank back down at that. She wasn't lying, and neither were the other kids. No one noticed Kev, Rod, and Rachel's disappearance. No, worse yet, they didn't even *know* them anymore! I was the only one who even remembered they even existed.\n\nIt's been at least three weeks since this all happened. I've been trying to look up more on the house, but every time, the search comes up empty. The only thing I can find about it is that one little article clipping from before. Nothing about what caused the fire or about the family that was living there. This led me to trying to search the family itself, though all that got me was the name, the Wallcrofts, and that they were apparently prominent members of the church back in the 80s and 90s. There was nothing about them personally, outside of a single letter that one of them apparently left behind, reading:\n\n**\"God is good. Though we walk in the shadow of the valley of death, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. I will fear no evil.**  **I see the Lord's light. We will all be delivered from this darkness...\"**\n\nThere were a few words after this, but those were the only ones I could actually read. Everything else was all but illegible, looking like the signature of a doctor's prescription. Or perhaps like it was written in a hurry. See, at first, I read that note and thought to myself, like I'm sure you probably did, \"*Yeah, okay, just some pompous religious monologue, sort of like every tele-evangelist you see on Sunday mornings, right?\"*\n\nHere's the kicker, that note had a *date!* 11/14/1991. Which, by the way, was only 3 days before the article about the fire was printed. That would make this one note the only surviving piece of evidence of their existence. That made me realize something with me.\n\nI am the only one that even remembers Kev, Rod, and Rachel. I think it has something to do with the fact that I took a picture of the black spots, their last mortal remains, before they vanished. Fortunately, even though I couldn't take a picture of it, I was able to remember what the symbol on the floor looked like and so I searched it up and found that it was the symbol of Leviathan.\n\nFor those few that don't know, Leviathan is the biblical beast that's said to lurk deep within the ocean, as well as the \"Serpent of the abyss\". Now, I still don't know why it's there in that house, or exactly what it has to do with what happened with the fire, but I think I have one guess as to what happened that night with my friends.\n\nI think, judging from the way they were acting before they disappeared, that the symbol, that Leviathan, somehow reached out and took them, snatching them out of this world and out of existence entirely. I still don't understand how or why it keeps happening or how no one's said anything about it, but I've noticed for the past few weeks now, that that same old ass UPS truck keeps driving through every Friday night to that house, and no one ever comes out to get it...",

If so, please forgive me.\n\nHe lurks in dark places. You might not even notice him at first. He camouflages himself to weasel his way into your life. That was how Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder slithered its way into every nook and cranny of my mind. It was unobtrusive at first.\n\nJust don’t let him into your head. Don’t let him see your fear. Once the creature wraps its frail fingers around you, its strength multiplies.\n\nIt quickly transforms into a terrifying entity that is near-impossible to remove.\n\nThat was a figurative speech which I used to give about my disorder. Since the events of Aaron Colt’s island, however, it has become a very *literal* warning.\n\nThese past six months, I’ve hardly been able to sleep. Though my disorder is gone, that doesn’t mean it’s *gone*. When it left my body, it didn’t leave this world. I’ve seen and heard things. He’s out there.\n\nBefore I discuss the present, I suppose I should finish discussing the past.\n\nAfter I escaped the clutches of the supernatural statue in my room, I stood in the pitch-black corridor and trembled.\n\n“Darryl?”\n\nThe sudden sound of a voice startled me, but I twisted my head to the left and felt an immense sense of relief. It was Letitia.\n\n“I think Aaron did something terrible to us,” I breathlessly told her.\n\nLetitia nodded at me with tear-filled eyes. She silently beckoned me to follow her back to her room. Barefooted, wearing nothing but pyjamas, we tiptoed down the corridor. I clenched my entire body in petrified preparation for what lay behind her door.\n\nHer door was wide open, and her bedside light was illuminating a sickening spectacle of horror. The walls of her room were alive, and they were *watching* us. Two peeled strips of wallpaper served as the room’s eyes. The decor undulated, reminding me of the spider-like creatures beneath my duvet.\n\n“Do you see that?” She tentatively asked. “Or is it in my head?”\n\n“I see it,” I whispered, shaking.\n\nLetitia looked at me with eyes huger than those of the wallpaper demon. It was a soul-broken stare.\n\n“Nobody’s ever seen what I’ve seen before…” Letitia cried. “The walls were swallowing me, and I barely broke free. But it was real. It wasn’t just in my head. What’s happening?”\n\n“Aaron Colt did exactly what he said he was going to do,” I said. “He cured us.”\n\nI gently closed the door on the terrifying wallpaper eyes that were gazing into my very soul.\n\nThere was a sudden crashing sound from Ryan’s room. Letitia sprinted down the corridor, and I struggled to keep up.\n\nWhen she opened his door, she screamed. “No… Ryan…”\n\nI darted down the darkened hallway and peered over Letitia’s shoulder to see what fresh hell awaited. I wish I’d asked her to close the door. I wish I hadn’t seen what lay inside.\n\nIn Ryan’s personal torture chamber, the wood of his four-poster bed had developed a life of its own. It had unfurled into a noose and hanged the man. His limp, lifeless body swung to and fro. He had bloodless skin, whiter than the flesh of my stone man, and his mouth was agape in a horrifyingly-eternal scream. We were witnessing the expression that he had worn as his demon murdered him. His face still haunts my dreams.\n\nEmma’s door suddenly flung open, and the woman came crawling into the corridor. Her nightgown was coated in claw-shaped scratches, and she was bawling loudly. With one of her bare, bloodied feet, she kicked her bedroom door shut.\n\n“What the fuck is happening?” She cried, looking at us.\n\nI would love to tell you that the three of us banded together, ran for our lives, and retreated to safety. We certainly tried.\n\n“We have to check that Nathaniel’s okay,” I found myself saying, despite my survival instincts saying otherwise.\n\n“I’m sorry… I can’t…” Emma sobbed.\n\nShe fled, sprinting down the stairs of Aaron’s expansive mansion. Only Letitia and I remained on the second floor. No sign of any staff members. Not a sound from another living person. Letitia silently nodded at me, and I regretted suggesting my courageous trip to save Nathaniel.\n\nClimbing the creaky staircase to the third and final floor, I had the most dreadful premonition. I already knew that we weren’t going to find Nathaniel in one piece, but I couldn’t have predicted what horrors we would uncover.\n\nEntering a wooden door at the top of the staircase, we discovered that the entire third floor was a converted attic space. Most of the floor was littered with dusty books and stacked cardboard boxes. Letitia and I manoeuvred through the spaghetti maze of junk stacks. I glanced at the titles of some of Aaron’s books. The mysterious man had an entire library up there. *Veilbreaking*, *Non-Science,* and *Little Faeries* were three titles that stuck in my head. Bizarre titles. A glimpse into the manner of man that lived in that malevolent mansion, I suppose.\n\nThere was a booming clatter from the far side of the enormous attic.\n\n“Nathaniel?” Letitia cried.\n\nNo answer. Not in words, anyway. The sound of rustling boxes and toppling items begged investigation. That being said, I didn’t like it. Not one bit. I’d tried to save Ryan. My gut had told me to run towards him. With Nathaniel, my gut was telling me to run away.\n\n“Aaron lied to you,” A voice boomed.\n\nNear the staircase, a door slammed.\n\n“He’s locked us in here,” I whispered to Letitia.\n\n“What are you talking about? We would’ve seen him if he’d slipped past us,” Letitia replied, but her trembling voice revealed her uncertainty.\n\n“Aaron told you that I had borderline-personality disorder,” Nathaniel giggled, his voice bouncing off the sloped ceiling. “But that isn’t my mental condition. Do you want to know what’s wrong with me?”\n\nLetitia and I had stopped walking. We looked at one another with terror in our eyes, no longer wanting to find Nathaniel. That voice was haunting. We turned around and started to weave back through the boxes, hoping to find the door unlocked.\n\n“My psychiatric diagnosis is antisocial-personality disorder,” Nathaniel explained in a guttural voice. “In layman’s terms, some call me a psychopath.”\n\nHis horrible laughter echoed around the room.\n\n“I killed the shell. Now I’m *free*. Finally free of that weak, fleshy, meat-sack,” The voice hissed.\n\nA scuttling sound from the ceiling stopped us in our tracks. I shone the phone torch above me, but I couldn’t see anything. I knew I’d heard something above us, though. And I definitely heard a quiet thud somewhere amongst the carnage of Aaron’s attic.\n\n“He’s boxing us in here,” I whispered to Letitia.\n\n“Stop it,” She pleaded. “You’re scaring me.”\n\n“You should be scared,” Nathaniel whispered.\n\nI cast the phone light onto the stack of boxes before us and caught a glimpse of a horrific monstrosity. It was Nathaniel. The same gangly, gloomy gentleman I’d first seen on that dock, but much taller. He rose far above the stacked boxes. His flesh had mutated into a dripping black slime, and his bloodshot eyes glistened in the darkness.\n\nThe creature that had separated itself from Nathaniel contorted its body into a thin, twisting spiral, gliding towards us between the boxes.\n\n“Run!” I screamed at Letitia.\n\nShe didn’t need to be told twice. We dashed around the cardboard column, dodging Nathaniel’s demonic grip. I heard that scuttling sound above us again.\n\n“Go!” I screeched.\n\nLetitia reached the door before me and flung it open. She started to sprint down the staircase, and I followed. A terrifying snarl erupted from behind me as I closed the door on the sludge face of the killer thing that had been flushed out of Nathaniel’s body.\n\nI was barely halfway down the stairs when the door opened, but I kept my eyes ahead. Letitia and I hurled ourselves downstairs, plunging into the lobby area — the *burning* lobby area. A fire had already engulfed the ground floor, and it was crawling up the stairs. I can only assume a member of staff set the place alight. Maybe Aaron himself.\n\nAs Letitia and I ran across the scorched lobby, I could feel Nathaniel on my tail. I was certainly he would pull me into the flames. But he didn’t. I don’t know what to tell you. All I know is that Letitia and I scarcely made it out of the mansion in one piece. And I’m certain Nathaniel didn’t. I heard the most piercingly sharp cry of pain behind me.\n\nAfter exiting the house and gathering on the grass with Letitia and a few members of staff, I eyeballed the inferno before me. No monstrosities fled the building in pursuit of us, so I keep telling myself that they didn’t make it out alive. It’s the only way I can sleep at night.\n\nA member of staff contacted the coast guard, and the relevant authorities were notified. When the ferry arrived to pick us up, the police commenced their investigation. Nobody ever found Emma. Aaron was nowhere to be seen. He had abandoned his island home. Had he known things would go so horribly wrong? Was that all part of his cruel plan?\n\nNobody ever talked about what they saw on the island. I didn’t even see anything about it on the news. The investigation was never publicly announced. Perhaps the police officers saw something that they wished they could un-see.\n\nI understand that there are many loose ends, but I can only tell you as much as I know. In spite of the horror I suffered in the past, I can’t stop thinking about the present. I’ve been collecting information from people who’ve seen the stone man.\n\nHe comes for those with fear in their hearts. He latches onto that fear, and he doesn’t let go. He has rules. Arbitrary rules. To refuse his demands comes with dire and unthinkable consequences.\n\nDon’t let the stone man inside your head. Once you do, he won’t want to leave.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "Link to part 1\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10meqmh/the_big_rock_candy_mountain_part_1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHands up, how many of you thought that that part about scale last time was just some little zinger to end things? Some cryptic nugget that you'll never hear about again? \r\n\r\nThat’s not my style. Despite what I’m sure you all are seeing as evidence to the contrary, I have no interest in trying to spook anyone out. I’m relating my plan for as much of the world to see as possible. If I get taken away to some dark hole between heaven and hell, maybe the next poor asshole can at least have a head start. \r\n\r\nAnd as for my plan? \r\n\r\nThat goes back to what we were just talking about, scale. \r\n\r\nBy the time I got to Johnny, I had plenty of unanswered questions, but you know what they say, a poor plan executed quickly is better than a perfect plan that never happens. All I needed to know was how deep the cesspool was. \r\n\r\nI liquidated my assets, burned my bridges and set off on a course to ruin my life. Which seems like a pretty easy thing to do, but fuck, even without trying to gain the attention of whatever the hell runs the mountain, that shit hurts. \r\n\r\nI thought of a few different ways to relate the physical effects of pumping this shit into yourself, to everyone here. An audience, I hope, for the most part, hasn’t lived the kind of life I have. And I think I’ve found a way. \r\n\r\nIt's  cancer, or at least a stone’s throw from it, and you pay for it. It’s for fucking idiots. \r\n\r\nI had a three page essay about how you could relate a year of killing yourself slowly, to the hours in a day, but no, there is no better explanation than fucking cancer. \r\n\r\nYou thin out, you get weak at first, your body burning through muscle mass. You forget to eat, you forget to sleep, you find yourself running in three day increments, your brain starts to misfire and slow down. \r\n\r\nThen comes the fun part, after a couple of months, you just get gross. The amount of medical grade horror that comes with tapping into your own plumbing, blowing out your sinuses, and tossing battery acid and cat litter into your lungs? You are ashamed and you don’t care all at the same time. \r\n\r\nAny time after that is just another nail in the coffin of any chance at a productive, happy life. Every day you become more institutionalized in a prison of 1 ml syringes and lighters that never God damned work. \r\n\r\nBut that isn’t the worst part of any of it, the worst part is that you get to watch everyone you care about see this happen to you. You see the looks, you know, family or friend, you’re the topic of gossip, and who can blame them? You aren’t the person they know and love any more, and you know it. \r\n\r\nSo, let’s get back to scale. \r\n\r\nIf this was just a local thing, some ‘place gone bad’ or resident demon, I’d have gone about things a different way. But whatever is pulling the strings here is old, dark, mean and everywhere. \r\n\r\nMeaning, the first step is going to have to be, playing it’s game. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I found out the hard way, was that having to start this journey alone doesn’t mean solitude. \r\n\r\nThree months in and  20 pounds lighter than I’d like to be  I start to feel something other than opioid constipation and stimulant diarrhea. \r\n\r\nPeople around me, they seem to fade into the background. Or maybe it’s me that fades, either way I find myself escaping notice, unless I try my hardest to do otherwise. \r\n\r\nI’m not going to lie, it was nice. But I couldn’t help but hearing Johnny’s voice in my head asking me what did I give up? \r\n\r\nMy day to day routine becomes a gray drudge of shoplifting, scoring dope and waking up in a new city every few days, never quite sure of now I got there. \r\n\r\nOne of these those endless nights I found myself in the back corner of a small bar. Eating  a plate of boosted bar nachos and drinking a bottle of forty Creek I took from behind the counter, within a couple feet of the staff. \r\n\r\nIt feels like the entire universe is giving me the cold shoulder, but that suits me just fine, when  I look in the mirror I see the same type of junkie goof I’d have had no trouble rolling a couple years ago. \r\n\r\nThe man catches my attention immediately, unlike the thousands of folks that seem to blend into background noise, he stands out, stark, real, and he sure as hell notices me. \r\n\r\nI don’t know his name, but I can tell at a distance his drug of choice can be found in an auto shop as opposed to a dimly lit alley. \r\n\r\nHis teeth are black, gums a sick construction paper brown, lips torn and lacking circulation. The end of his nose drops, and his eyes are filled with burst blood vessels, sharply contrasting with the man’s pale skin. I’ve seen it before, fucking gas huffer. \r\n\r\nHe's five foot seven, maybe a hundred and sixty pounds or so, and wearing a starched black overcoat. His body language, and the way he invades my space casually let’s me know he’s someone who’s comfortable spilling blood. \r\n\r\nHe looks to my bottle of booze and the tiny  pile of white powder on the table and scoffs. He makes eye contact with me, and reaches  inside his oversized coat, pulling out a leather bag, about the size of a purse. He puts his mouth and nose in the petrol reeking sack hyperventilating it’s contents before returning it to the depths of his coat. \r\n\r\n“Your first time seeing someone else on the path, friend? “ the creepy little guy says, long, black hair patchy with white streaks, another side effect of long term gas huffing. \r\n\r\n“Not interested in whatever it is you’re selling. “ I say, far from the picture of health, but still a few inches taller, and a lot heavier than the manlet in front of me. \r\n\r\nThe high-octane hobbit tilts his head like a confused dog, seeming to study me for a moment. \r\n\r\nI see rage in those clouded eyes, and I expect him to pull a knife, or gun, maybe try and jump across the table, but the little man does none of these things. He reaches over, slowly, and drops something into my open bottle of booze. \r\n\r\nThis guy wants a fight, but for some reason doesn’t want to throw the first punch. I don’t take the bait. \r\n\r\n“Just about done with that anyway. “ I say, calmly, as I slowly push the bottle off of the table. It hits the floor, shattering on the greasy brown tile. For a moment a handful of people look our way, but not one of them seems to see anything out of the ordinary. \r\n\r\nI smell something, like knock off fruit cereal, rotten almonds, and paint thinner. My vision blurs, I try to stand, but my legs are wobbling. \r\n\r\nI begin to lose consciousness, as the pint sized pale prick grabs me by the chin, hard enough to make me feel a shooting pain through the my rapidly dulling senses. \r\n\r\n“You fucking druggies, you think you love chemicals. But you don’t.  \r\n\r\nYou are chemical voyeurs so wrapped up in the spectacle of the end product, you’d never for a second think to appreciate the deep beauty of its components. \r\n\r\nBut, you got here, somehow, so you have value to us. And now, we get to have ourselves a little party.” He throws me to the ground head first,  taking my last remaining bits of wakefulness. \r\n\r\nMy vision clears, the effects of whatever toxic gas put me out finally staring to wane. \r\n\r\nIt’s deep into the small hours of the morning, dew making my clothes damp and sticky in the mid summer weather. \r\n\r\nIt’s a public park, the type of place that had money poured into it 20 years ago but through abuse, neglect and circumstance serves as a nexus for the shady dealings of a city. The kind of place where no one is going to see what happens, and if they do, they know to mind their own fucking business. \r\n\r\nThe picnic table is rusted steel lattice, and the first thing I notice are the handcuffs I’m wearing, threaded through a crudely cut hole in the vintage metalwork. \r\n\r\nThe second are the 3 other people in more or less the same situation. \r\n\r\nTo my right sits a man in his late 50’s, long gray hair tied with a faded bandana, denim jacket and a face that says he’s seen a lot, but it hasn’t hardened him up much. He’s scared as hell, eyes darting around like the first moments of a seizure. \r\n\r\nThe guy in front of me is young, in his 20’s at most. And I can’t say much more than he looks like the kind of guy who spends a lot of time online getting really angry about topics he feels very strongly about. He spits curses and threats, but doesn’t waste energy trying to break the hardened steel cuffs. \r\n\r\nThe last man is calm, already looking at our captors, appraising the situation. He’s six foot plus, lean, but not lanky, almost an Abe Lincoln  build to him. His nose has been broken, not recently, but historically, and often. His hands are calluses being kept company by layered scars, and as we make eye contact he smirks, one side of his grin is shattered, pointed and fang like. I’ve seen that injury before, curb stomp that didn’t go as planned. \r\n\r\nI hope the guy still has a bit of that luck to spare. \r\n\r\nI count five guys, all dressed similarly to the little bastard who played chemistry set with my bottle of stolen booze. I start to piece together a little bit about them. \r\n\r\nThey hunch over tables, giving each other a healthy amount of space. They seem to be working together, even have a hierarchy ( as another loogie in my face from fate, the puny poisoner seems to be king shit of turd mountain.), but there’s a half feral swagger to their movements, an aggressive animalistic edge to the way they hiss at their fellows who come close to the can or bag they loom protectively over. \r\n\r\nThey huff paint, sniff glue, take quick swigs out of bottles with MSDS sheets long since faded to nothing. Cans of nitrous and CO2 litter the area, like the aftermath of the world’s saddest frat party. \r\n\r\n“Is everyone awake? Good, looks like we have a few new faces showing up to the party. \r\n\r\nAnd you rabbit, you really just don’t have any luck do you old man? \r\n\r\nAnywho, for those of you who don’t know, we are The Hatters. We are those who seek to find the quickest path to the mountain, who understand the base purity of poison, and the base level of use even weak mixtures such as yourself can have. “ The short man’s comment elicits a scattered round of laughter from his companions. \r\n\r\n“You have no right to get in the way of my journey” The young angry man growls, he kicks out at one of the Hatters as it passes by pouring contact cement into a paper bag. \r\n\r\nMy heart stops, I can see the short man, who I dub ‘Danny’ suppress an eye twitch, his left hand beginning to open and close of its own accord. \r\n\r\nBut Danny composes himself, and holds out one hand expectantly. \r\n\r\nCasually, almost effortlessly, a passing Hatter hands him an old brass alarm clock. He slowly cranks a dial on the back, showing us all the face of the clock. The night is silent, and the seconds he stands still stretch out into an eternity. \r\n\r\nIn a blur of motion he slams the timepiece onto the table, a loud, rusty sounding ticking begins. \r\n\r\n“You all have one hour to tell each other everything you know about the path, the mountain, and the game. \r\n\r\nWe will be listening in, of course, and if we hear anything useful, everyone leaves just as happy as they came in. \r\n\r\nI know, trusting us might seem like a poor option, but ask our friend rabbit, our standards are reasonable, and our fines fair. “ Danny grins a venomous leer toward rabbit as he produces a fist sized jar. \r\n\r\nHe slowly untwists the lid as the smell of formaldehyde begins to seep into the air. Danny takes a small sip before securing the lid and placing the jar on the table like a centrepiece. \r\n\r\nRabbit looks anywhere but at the grotesque contents. \r\n\r\nTwo human ears, removed with glee as opposed to skill float in the off green fluid. And as the aging, trapped man twists his head, I have my answer as to where the organs came from. \r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you everything you need to know about me right now fuck-face. \r\n\r\nI came here by my own fucking merits, and I’ll be God damned if I let some…. “  The angry young man is red faced with impotent rage, his monologue cut short. \r\n\r\nDanny breaks most of the man’s teeth with a tarnished silver flask, the backhanded blow seeming almost reflex. He twists the top off, thin white fumes rise from within. \r\n\r\nThe scarred man seems to react for the first time, lifting his head slightly. \r\n\r\n“Sulphuric acid? “ he says to Danny, his tone casual, curious. \r\n\r\nDanny rolls his eyes with the distain of a microbrew fan hearing about the history of Coors. \r\n\r\n“For jewelers and tinkers. \r\nThis, is called ‘piranha solution’ in the gutter tongue. It’s purpose isn’t to clean or to mend, but, to teach…” with a rotten toothed grin that seems to split his face for a moment Danny turns, splashing the contents of the flask into the young man’s damaged face. \r\n\r\nThe reaction is instant and extreme. Violent sputtering makes liquefied flesh and muscle start to cover the table. For a few seconds the young man screams, but something melts, fuses or dissolves and turns that into a haunting, alien, Hollow sounding bellow. \r\n\r\nIf you asked me a few years back if I’d ever seen a person die, I’d have put on a tough guy look and told you ‘A few times’. But as I saw the brutal, mentally scarring spectacle before me, I realized how full of shit I was. \r\n\r\nI’d been around death, twice, my only interaction being staying as far away as possible from an act that may or may not have happened. And I thought that made me Charles fucking Bronson. \r\n\r\nThis kid spends his last seconds trying in vain to cave in his own skull. Through the drugs, and the head trauma, I feel a little bit of my soul die seeing this. \r\n\r\n**tick tock, tick tock, tick tock**\r\n\r\nThe melting corpse of the young man acts as a brutal punctuation mark to the sentence we find ourselves serving. \r\n\r\nThe old head speaks, up, clearly having been through this before. \r\n\r\n“Been going by Rabbit since about 93, and all I know about the path is that going slow is the only way you survive this shit. \r\n\r\nI know it’s not what anyone wants to hear, especially you guys with the detective coats, but it’s the truth. I’ve been on the path 20 years now, and every day I get a little closer, and every day I watch people kill or damn themselves trying to make this a sprint. \r\n\r\nBeing careful is the only thing I know about the path. “\r\n\r\n**Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock**\r\n\r\nI know it’s in my head but the seconds seem to be going by faster now. I take my turn to speak. \r\n\r\n“I’m Kevin, I’m not really sure how long I’ve been on the path, a year maybe, possibly a little less. \r\n\r\nI know that everything else seems distant, I feel like a ghost, except, you know, ghosts don’t puke if they can’t get a bag of dope. Not that I ever remember where I get my dope anymore. \r\n\r\nBut I think whoever is in charge here killed a friend of mine for a reason. I don’t know if that helps here, but it’s about the only thing I know for sure anymore. “\r\n\r\nIt's the tall man’s turn to speak, but he stays silent, he’d look relaxed if he wasn’t bent shackled. \r\n\r\nThe guy is dressed simply, he’s almost too generic looking for the story his damaged body tells. Jeans and a white t-shirt. I peg him as a lunatic, ex-military maybe, willing to let us all die to prove he’s a tough guy. \r\n\r\nYou’d think he would understand that doesn’t work. \r\n\r\n**Tick-Tock, Click-Tock, Tick-Tock**\r\n\r\nA barrel chested hatter begins placing copper cups in front of each of us. The silence is unbearable, the clock shows twenty minutes left, and no one has seemed happy with any of the information given. \r\n\r\nA copper pot is placed beside the clock. I can only guess as to the horrors inside. \r\n\r\nThe tall man sighs, as if finally bored. \r\n\r\n“I’m going to make things real simple for everyone here. My name doesn’t fucking matter. \r\n\r\nMaybe who I am does, or where I’m from though. And if that gets everyone out of here quicker, I’m happy to share. “ The scarred man smiles making eye contact with Danny. \r\n\r\n“ I come from a place where the world makes sense. Where monsters,  ghosts, and whatever Twin Peakery this is, just doesn’t happen. \r\n\r\nBut one day through no fault of my own, I found myself in a place just a little off of normal, and once I got used to that, you confusingly themed Skid-marks drag me into the shadow realm or some shit. \r\n\r\nI don’t belong here, I belong back home doing what I do best. “ The nameless guy lets this statement hang for a moment, inviting a response. \r\n**Click-Tock, Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock**\r\n\r\n“Which is? “ Danny says with distain. \r\n\r\nAfter a full minute of silence Danny laughs, turning away, assuming the verbal standoff won. \r\n\r\n“Putting on a costume, and killing people. “ The late reply is followed by an explosion of movement from the scarred man. \r\n\r\nOne handcuff hangs open, a piece of wire sticking out of it at an awkward angle, it’s lock picked and jammed. The teapot tips spilling caustic  fluid over the already rusted lattice top table. \r\n\r\nThe tall man uses his handcuffs as a bludgeon, bringing his fist down on the top of Danny’s spine with a sickening crunch. The evil little bastard hits the ground, motionless, the rest of his twisted gang not noticing till the Nameless man is standing beside their leaders corpse. \r\n\r\nRabbit and I begin to yank at the handcuffs, seeing an opportunity The weakened steel of the table begins to give way. We both brace our leg against the steel frame, trying to pull in unison. \r\n\r\nThe tall man stares down the 4 remaining hatters. \r\n\r\n“Back home I never really liked code names, or media nicknames, all seemed, fake, forced. \r\n\r\nNight stalker, Stormin’ Norman, The Ice Man, Angel of Death, fuck off. \r\n\r\nBut here, everything is so… camp? Maybe I do need one. \r\n\r\nAnd all the best names, well they are about what someone makes. Cooper, Shueman, Fletcher, you get it. “ The acid rotted steel gives way, sending Rabbit and myself stumbling backward as the Scarred man talks, he closes the distance between himself and the hatters. \r\n\r\nThe first to try his luck, is  the massive guy who was passing out the cups. He pulls a long thin knife from a sleeve, but it falls within a second as its owner clutches the gaping socket where an eye once was. \r\n\r\nRabbit and I are still cuffed, but free to leave,  we find ourselves stunned, almost hypnotized. \r\n\r\nThe flury of violence that ensues isn’t one sided, the tall man is splashed with some kind of caustic foam, cut in a dozen places, at one point taken to the ground, but never taken completely out of the fight. \r\n\r\n“So, by that logic, I guess… “ The tall mean spits a mouthful of blood on a fallen hatter, “ You guys can call me Sadhatter, cause I’ll be making a fucking lot of those. “ \r\n\r\nBy the time I can look away, all of the living combatants are hurt, and struggling to move. The look in Rabbit’s eyes says “ Run” but as I see more hatters start to appear, walking toward us one of the last scraps of my soul tries to make me do the right thing. \r\n\r\n“We’ve got to help him. “ I say, running toward our unlikely hero. \r\n\r\nWith no arms Rabbit tackles me from behind, he does his best to keep me pinned without use of his arms, I do my best to escape, neither of us are very successful. \r\n\r\n“Kev, buddy, I’m inclined to believe that crazy bastard that he’s not supposed to be here. And if I’m right, helping him has a pretty good chance of launching us from the path. \r\n\r\nYou may not get it yet, but your body and soul are going at speeds they were never intended to reach, metaphorically. You stop that all at once? Everything that makes you up gets splattered across the cosmic fucking highway. “ As awkward hearing this an inch away from my right ear, is, Rabbit is the first person who seems to not want to kill me, so I figure I owe him a little benefit of the doubt. \r\n\r\nI don’t like it, but we both stand, The Sadhatter has finished the last of the first group of hatters, and goes through jackets, I can see panic in his body language now, he’s looking for a weapon, something to even the odds. I count ten more coming in, all intent on avenging their pack mates. \r\n\r\nI’d like to think that if I was a badass, if I knew what I was doing in a fight, I’d have went back. The fact of the matter is, Levi is dead, and saving some poor bastard that didn’t even try to get into this shit storm would be a much more noble hill to die on than a quest for trivia about my best friends death. \r\n\r\nBut I’m not, this isn’t a story about that guy. This is a story about me, and my obsession. So I follow rabbit as the sounds of violence start to ring out from behind us.",

        "text": "We were on vacation backpacking through Europe, staying in hostels and trying to make every penny count, when we met Lorenzo. We were in a pub outside London, doing what American college students do best when traveling across the pond. Mostly, pissing off the locals. We were about to get kicked out of yet another pub, the third one since our trip started, when he approached us.\n\n“You Americans, you only think you know how to have fun. I show you better way, show you things that you will talk about for the rest of your lives… for a price” he said, his thick Italian accent obscuring the insulting nature behind his words and hyping the intrigue of his offer.\n\nThere were four of us. Marcus- my best friend, Julie- his girlfriend, and Amanda- Julie’s best friend. I always had the biggest crush on Amanda, ever since we first met. Me? I’m Franklin, by the way. Four American college students, spending the summer in Europe, making memories and seeing the inside of as many pubs and bars as we could afford.\n\nWhen this young darkly handsome Italian approached us and offered to show us an unforgettable time, we were all skeptical. We’ve all seen too many movies and knew to be weary about who you trust in a strange new land. Hostel, Taken, etc. We were all ready to blow him off, until he mentioned Rome. That was all it took.\n\n“OMG, I’ve always wanted to go there! Just think of the centuries worth of history, the brilliant architecture, the sculptures and paintings! It’s on my bucket list! Oh please please please, can we!?” Amanada pleaded desperately. She seemed to be alone on the decision of wanting to go, so me being smitten by her like I was, I jumped on the bandwagon. Anything that I could do to make her happy, as well as spend more time with her, I was down for.\n\n“That’s two for, and two against. We’re deadlocked, it seems. Come on, Marcus, pretty please? If we all go there will be four of us. There’s only one of him, if push comes to shove. Plus, you’ve got that stun gun, Julie. And Marcus, you know karate…” Amanda pleaded with the couple.\n\n“How much?” Marcus asked the stranger, his resolve visibly weakening.\n\n“You pay for my train ticket and give me 50 euros, and we go, I take you” Lorenzo said with his limited use of English. “My cousin is priest, I take you to beautiful church, and he let us in. Show you things not allowed to the public…” he said, trying to seal the deal. It worked, as shortly after we were all in agreement.\n\nOn the train ride there we all goofed about and bantered. I couldn’t help but notice Lorenzo was suspiciously quiet. I had chalked it up to him not having the best grasp of the English language, much less our bastardized American version of it. So long as he kept his word, we were sure to have a blast, but I still kept my eyes on him like a hawk. He had agreed that we wouldn’t have to pay him until we arrived at the church in question, a reasonable stipulation. Even so, I didn’t fully trust him.\n\nWhen we arrived, Lorenzo made a few phone calls, speaking Italian the whole time. Marcus, standing behind him, began mocking him by pressing his fingers and thumb together and flapping his wrists in that classically Italian gesture that they tend to do when talking passionately about something, usually food. It got a chuckle out of us, and thankfully Lorenzo hadn’t noticed, so engrossed he was with his phone conversation.\n\nWhen he finally finished his phone call, he bid us to follow him. We passed many gorgeous fountains and ancient temples of worship along the way. Naturally, Amanda wanted to stop at every single one and take it all in, though reluctantly couldn’t, lest we fall behind our guide.\n\n“We’ll have plenty of time to check all of it out after our little adventure. This guy is supposed to show us things not usually open to the public, and all of the regular sights aren’t going anywhere. We’ll come back, I promise” Marcus chided her along.\n\nI couldn’t blame her, the sheer number of beautiful statues, frescos, and unique architectural marvels that we passed couldn’t help but catch the eye. This place was like a daunting maze, and around every corner history had been lived and written. We would have to stay here for days to see even a fraction of all that it had to offer.\n\n“Here we are, my friends. Chiesa del Gesu- the First Church of the Jesuits. Stay right here, while I find my uncle” he said, and was off. He left us standing before it’s amazing paintings in the nave.\n\n“That’s odd…” I thought. “Didn’t he say we were going to see his cousin? Now he says it’s his uncle” I pointed out.\n\n“English isn’t exactly his first language. Maybe he misspoke?” Julie said.\n\n“Look '' Amanda pointed across the large church to where Lorenzo was talking with an older looking man wearing priest garb. “He obviously meant uncle, judging by their age difference. Plus, the guy looks legit, I seriously doubt we’d be scammed by a man of god. Wouldn’t be very Christ-like.” We laughed at the tone in which she added that last bit, drawing the judging eyes of several nearby parishioners deep in prayer.\n\n“Cousin, uncle, priest or pope. I don’t care, if they try to pull anything over on us, I’ll fuck ‘em up” Marcus added, receiving a smack on the arm from Julie at his side.\n\n“Don’t curse. We’re in God’s house” she said after the smack, shooting daggers with her eyes. She always was the adult in the relationship. Back in our first year of college, Marcus and Julie had first met when he was acting an immature fool and Julie called him out on his bullshit. They’ve been together ever since, proving that at least in some cases, opposites really do attract.\n\nI turned and left their bickering to go and stand next to Amanda, who had wandered a few feet away and was completely engrossed in the majesty of a fresco on the ceiling portraying dozens of souls ascending up into the heavens, a multitude of cherub-like angels and saints above surrounding Jesus waiting to receive them. Golden rays of sunshine bathed their stoic faces as they gazed upward into the torrent of angels above. In contrast surrounding the perimeter of the painting were a gathering of stucco sculpted heretics, appearing to be hurled back toward the earth on their dark storm infested clouds. The whole arrangement, when combined together, had an effect as if the three dimensional sculpted sinners were pouring forth from the painting, and was jaw dropping in it’s intricacy and grandeur.\n\nWe stood there in silence, absorbing it all in, when a voice broke our trance. “It’s magnificent, isn’t it?”\n\nWe both turned around and looked. It was Lorenzo’s cousin/uncle, standing behind us and looking upward to the installment that had us so captivated, his hands folded behind his back in a posture of unthreatening authority.\n\n“It was designed by Giovanni Battista Guili, years after the church’s completion. You see the sinners, around its border? Protestants, or so the church believes. Are… are you Protestants, by chance?” he asked, though in a non judgemental tone.\n\n“No sir. I was raised Catholic, until my mother passed away” I said, receiving a smile from the older priest. \n\nHe turned to Amanda, raising a quizzical eyebrow as if to ask “And you?”\n\n“Oh, non denominational” she answered his silent query.\n\nHe merely maintained his friendly smile at her answer, though for just a split second, I could swear I saw a facial twitch.\n\n“Those were different times” he said, gesturing back upward with a glance. “These days, all are welcome in The Lord’s house… the way it should be. Lorenzo told me you are students, yes? And that you wish to see some of our more… private artifacts in our collection?”\n\n“Yes sir, very much so!” Amanda answered, her face beaming with excitement.\n\n“Please, call me Father. Father Antonio. And it would be my pleasure. If you could gather your friends over there, and meet me by the ambulatory whenever you are ready” he stated, giving a nod before turning and walking away toward one of the side walls deeper within the structure.\n\n“Oh my god, oh my god!” Amanda said, giddy. “This is going to be amazing, I can already tell.” She reached out and grabbed me by the hand. Her skin was so soft, I remember thinking at the time. How I wanted to hold her hand so badly, numerous times since I met her, my heart skipped a beat. She looked up and into my eyes, sincerity incarnate. “Thank you so much, Franklin. I know you only agreed to do this because I wanted to so badly. I’m not blind, I’ve seen the way you look at me sometimes, when you think I’m not looking” she squeezed my hand tenderly. “I’ve been waiting quite a while for you to make your move, ya know…” she said, smiling up at me, her eyes two hazel pools I wanted to drown in.\n\n“I…uh…me?” I stuttered, completely taken off guard by this sudden turn of events. “What’s not to like? You’re… amazing. In every way…” I somehow managed to blurt, as if the words were already within my throat waiting to be released. “I’ve wanted to tell you for so lon-” I continued, but was stopped by her putting a silencing finger to my lips, accompanied by the brightest smile I’ve ever seen grace her beautiful lips.\n\n“We’ll talk later” she shushed me with a wink. The butterflies in my gut were flapping and fluttering so hard, it’s a miracle I didn’t lift off of the ground and get carried upward into the waiting heavens above along with the other faithful portrayed in the masterpiece we had just been gazing upon mere moments ago.\n\nStill holding hands, we returned to Marcus and Julie, still bickering where we had left them.\n\n“It’s legit! Are you guys ready, or do you need more time to argue about who has the bigger ego?” Amanda teased playfully. We all knew that would take decades.\n\nMarcus swung his arm around Julie. “Nah we’re ready, I was just making a point and winning.” This awarded him with Julie’s elbow to his ribs.\n\nTogether, we made our way across the church toward the waiting priest. Marcus leaned back, locking eyes with me behind the girls’ shoulders. He looked down at Amanda’s hand and mine intertwined, then back up at me. In that moment, we used that ability all guys have with other men, holding an entire conversation with nothing more than a few glances, and facial expressions. If conveyed with actual words, it would have gone something like- \n\nHim: “You FINALLY made your move!?” \n\nMe: “Something like that.” \n\nHim: “Nice, bro! About damn time.”\n\nNo doubt the girls had their own psychically silent conversation, only they were far better at it in every way, and were able to convey infinitely more complex notions and communicate without the need of even eye contact. Such is the advanced nature of the fairer sex.\n\nBefore we arrived in front of the old priest we were intercepted by Lorenzo, who merely extended his palm in expectation of payment. He seemed satisfied when the money was placed in his grasp, and wordlessly he turned toward the entrance and left.\n\nWe followed Father Antonio through an intricately carved door that was previously cordoned off by a red velvet rope.\n\n“I suppose you want the full tour experience?” he asked as he led the way, not even glancing over his shoulder at us.\n\n“Yes, please!” Amanda chirped.\n\n“Of Course. Construction began in 1568, under the leadership of Pope Pius V who was granted the duty of Pope two years before. He died sadly, before seeing its completion in 1580.”\n\n“Bull. You’re telling us that this place only took 12 years to build? All of this?” Marcus asked incredulously.\n\n“Absolutely. Many of the frescos and other installations were later additions, mind you. But the actual building itself, only 12 years. It was a testament to the skill of the stonemasons of their time. Sadly, Pope Pius V never saw its completion while… let’s say, he was above ground.”\n\n“Astounding…” Amanda muttered under her breath, while gawking.\n\n“Would you like to see him?” Father Antonio asked, receiving only our confusion as an answer.\n\n“Like… his corpse?” I said, not able to discern the man of God’s intent.\n\nHis face was a death mask of seriousness. He merely stood there, staring at us wordlessly for several moments, moments that stretched out into an awkward if not macabre eternity. He finally broke the tension with a comical, yet warm smile. “Of course not. I have a portrait of him in my office.” He let out a slight chuckle at our relief. We all let out laughs as well. Laughs that were masking sighs of relief.\n\n“You’re funny, Father. I didn’t know priests were allowed to have a sense of humor” Julie said.\n\n“When you’ve been in the church as long as I have, you’ll discover that God Himself has the ultimate sense of humor, my child.”\n\nWe followed the old man from room to room while he went into historic detail about the many artworks and installations of Chiesa del Gesu. Many master painters and sculptors attributed to that grand cathedral over the centuries, each one adding to its magnificent grandeur. We were surrounded by beautiful things, though I’ll admit, I zoned out a good deal everytime we transitioned between rooms. By far, the most beautiful thing in the church was still holding my hand, giving subtle and gentle squeezes, every one a message my mind occupied itself in deciphering.\n\n“What’s down there?” Marcus asked while we were walking down a particularly ancient looking stone corridor. He pointed through a stone archway which led downward into blackness.\n\n“That, my son, leads down into the substructure. It’s where the church keeps some of our more… delicate secrets.”\n\n“Secrets? What kind of secrets?” he asked.\n\n“The kind forbidden to the public. That is all you need to know” he answered curtly.\n\nIt was at that moment a younger man wearing church garb came quickly around the corner in which we had just come. He called out to Father Antonio and hastily walked up to the old priest. He was panting heavily, as if he had been running before turning the corner in his search for the old man. After whispering something into his ear, Father Antonio’s posture straightened and his eyes widened, as if in alarm.\n\n“That concludes our tour, I’m afraid. There’s a pressing matter that requires my personal attention. I apologize, but I must leave you here, I trust you remember the way back to the nave?” he asked but was already walking away at a fast pace, making the question a rhetorical one and leaving us standing there unattended.\n\n“That was… odd,” Amanda said. “I wonder what was up with that?”\n\n“I dunno, but I didn’t feel like I quite got my money’s worth” Marcus stated, already peering toward whatever lay at the bottom of the dark stone stairwell. Down toward the ‘forbidden’. “What do you say, guys?”\n\n“I’m not so sure. I think we call it a day and find a place to hang our hats for the night” I said. I’m not gonna lie, I WAS curious, but my opinion was biased. I was slightly more concerned with leaving so that Amanda and I could be alone. I was thrilled with this turn of events between us, and I had SO much on my mind that I wanted to pour out to her. In private. I’d do just about anything for that woman, which was why whenever she tugged my hand to follow down those roughly hewn stone steps, I followed.\n\nIt was dark, and lighting the way with the flashlight on his phone, Marcus led the way. After a while, the steps began curving downward, and with the depth the temperature began dropping. The stone walls glistened with moisture as we descended deeper and deeper. Amanda’s hand became sweaty in mine, as she began gripping it tighter as we went. I had to hand it to her though, even though she was obviously getting a little perturbed by how deep we were going, she hadn’t put it to words. I guess her curiosity outweighed her fear. She was braver than Julie, at least, who had begged to turn back several times by the time we finally reached the bottom.\n\nAt the bottom was a corridor. It appeared to be cut from the very volcanic rock itself, and as we all shined our cell phone lights around into the darkness I couldn’t help but feel amazed.\n\n“I know what this is!” Amanda exclaimed, her voice echoing far off into the distance from both sides of the tunnel. “These are some of the lost catacombs beneath Rome!”\n\n“Catacombs?” Julie whispered loudly, as if fearing to reproduce the echo that Amanda’s voice had just caused. “Like dead people? Hell nah…” She began trying to drag Marcus back up the stairs by the hand, though she hadn’t been able to even budge him.\n\n“Fuckin sweet. Now this is what I paid for!” he said, not even phased by Julie’s incessant pulling and attempts at dragging him. “It’ll be alright babe, I got you. Just stay close to me if you’re scared.”\n\nShe reluctantly gave up, knowing like we all did that once Marcus got it in his mind he was doing something, there was no easy way of talking him out of it. With her arms drawn in close to her sides, she squished her body against his, reminding me of a shy child hiding behind their mother’s skirt.\n\nIt was like entering a forgotten era, a sepulchre for the dead. There were numerous slots carved into the walls lining both sides of the passage stacked three high in most places. ‘Loculi’, as Amanda called them. Few still had large rectangular slate sheets of rock enclosing them in, though for every one that was still intact, there were dozens that were smashed open, and even more that were nonexistent and open to the beams of our lights. Shrouded skeletons occupied them, their shapes beneath the time worn shrouds suggestive of the bones belonging to the occupants beneath.\n\n“I wrote a paper on the catacombs beneath Paris. While doing research for it, I sourced a good deal on other catacombs around Europe. These loculi were meant for most of the general Christian population. Richer families could afford cubicula- think of them more like an underground mausoleum or like a little room all to themselves. The more extravagant ones were reserved for bishops and martyrs. Even some saints. Those were called arcosolia” Amanda explained, obviously enthralled by the subject, and was thus like a kid in a candy shop about where we had ended up.\n\nI shined my light down at an almost unrecognizable shape on the lip inside of one of the loculi. I walked over to get a better look, and saw what looked like a little wood carving of a horse. I shined deeper inside of the recess, and saw the skeleton of a child, no more than 10 years old.\n\n“Many buried their dead with some of their possessions. Usually with tools that denoted their occupation in life, like this one” she pointed out the one above it. There was a crude hammer lying next to the dusty old bones. “He was probably a carpenter, maybe a stone mason” she went on as if she were giving a lecture.\n\nWe traveled deeper into that monument for the dead. It twisted and turned, we ran into multiple dead ends, each one usually housing a more extravagant and intricately carved alcove housing a family's worth of skeletons. In the forefront of my mind, I wanted to turn back, and the deeper we went the stronger the feeling became. I’ve never been claustrophobic, but the narrowness of some of those hallways was enough to make me reconsider. I’ll freely admit, the only thing driving me forward was Amanda. I’d have followed her to the very center of the earth, despite the dread and fear that was creeping ever so closer and growing to unignorable proportions. I didn’t want her to think me a coward. I wish I would have spoken up. I wish I could go back and drag all of us out of that sepulchre of the dead, even if it did hurt my chances with her.\n\nWe were going ever deeper, and though there weren’t many twists or turns that didn’t stop in dead ends, the path back would be arduous. \n\nWe had just entered into a large room, by far the largest yet. The ceiling had to be at least 30 feet above us. Shining our lights upward, we were greeted with a series of gothic style arches, carved in black rock. They looked so out of place with the surrounding rock that they had been placed around as supports. They were carved from what we first believed to be onyx, though I’d never seen onyx so black before. I swear, they absorbed all light, not even casting the reflections of our slowly dwindling lights from our phones. My battery was getting low, and we had been down there so long, all of us using our phones' flashlights to illuminate our way, the others had to be in similar shape.\n\n“Oh my god!” Amanda gasped. “We’re in some kind of underground cathedral, see the alter, over there?”\n\nThen I heard it. It was ever so faint, but sounded like the rustling of heavy linked chains. I pointed it out to the others, but they swore I was just hearing things. Julie was the only one beside me that agreed when I suggested that we turn back. Marcus and Amanda both were having far too good a time in this pit, surrounded by corpses. I pleaded with them, their opinions of me be damned, it was time to go.\n\n“Don’t be such a chickenshit, Frankie. Just a little further, then we’ll turn back-” Marcus was saying, the whole while Julie was tugging at his sleeve.\n\n“M-Marcus… what the fuck is that over there?!” she pleaded, her tone of voice seeping with fright.\n\nWe all stopped and looked to an alcove behind the stone altar at the back of the chapel. There was another roughly cut stone doorway behind it that led further into the darkness. The doorway itself wasn’t much different than the dozens we had already passed through on our underground journey thus far. What made this one stand out from the others were the dark smears around it. What looked like bloody handprints stained its edge. Handprints that looked as if they were grasping the edge of the stone, a vain attempt to fight whatever had wanted to drag them deeper into the inky blackness beyond.\n\n“Holy shit…” Marcus whispered, showing the first signs of fear since we had left the world of the living up above. “I think it’s time to leave now.”\n\n“I don’t think that’s an option anymore” A voice boomed into the chamber, followed by the loud slamming of metal on stone.\n\nWe all turned toward the source of the voice, back toward the way we had come in. Our lights illuminated a large iron portcullis, barring the entrance. On the other side stood Father Antonio, a solemn look upon his face.\n\n“I truly am sorry, my children. Don’t think that this doesn’t weigh heavily upon me. It always does…” he said, a look of disappointment filling his eyes.\n\n“HEY! WHAT THE FUCK? Let us out of here!” Marcus yelled, irate at the servant of God. “You’re locking us in?”\n\n“I wish it didn’t have to be this way. The truth is, I trusted you all to leave. I gave you a choice, whether you realized it at the time or not” he stated, sadness seeping into his voice. He looked downward, unable to meet our eyes. “They always make the wrong choice…”\n\nThe sound of the chains came slowly rattling from behind us, unmistakable this time. They came as if following footsteps, approaching slowly and growing louder with every clank.\n\n“What are you talking about? Come on, Father, let us out! We’re- we’re sorry, okay!?” Julie said, pleading as tears welled up in her eyes.\n\n“No, my child. I’M sorry.”\n\n“What is that noise? What’s in that other room?” Amanda asked, probably the calmest out of all of us about how this situation was developing.\n\nFather Antonio made the sign of the cross, and kissed the crucifix that he wore around his neck. There were tears rolling down his cheeks. “Do you recall me saying that God has the ultimate sense of humor?” he asked, his voice cracking toward the last. “Meet Pope Pius V. Before his tragic ‘death’, he was bitten by a creature. A spawn of Hell…”\n\n“Yo, what in the hell are you talking about? Quit fucking with us and let us out! Call the police and have us arrested for trespassing, we’re sorry, okay!? Just let us out!” Marcus pleaded.\n\nIt was too late though. The creature that was once Pius V, leader of Christ’s Kingdom here on earth, was upon us.\n\nThe rest happened fast, Julie screamed a blood curdling screech, and her phone dropped to the stone, its light illuminating the black pillars above. The sounds of wet crunching silenced her mid-cry. \n\nMarcus hadn’t even had time to yell before he was swatted against the far wall, producing a bone crushing thwack. It was upon him in an instant. \n\nAmanda, looking up into my eyes, seemed resigned to our fate, and chose to spend her last moments on this earth looking up at me. Her hand, grasping mine tightly, spasmed as in an instant she was no longer standing before me. I felt something wet and warm splatter on my face. All I could do was stand there, not even realizing that the spasming grasp of Amanda’s severed hand was still in my grasp. \n\nI had loved her. I realize that now. She was made by God for me, and I for her.\n\nI continued to stand there in shock, waiting for the proverbial executioner’s ax to drop and end my wretched existence. It never did.\n\nI had gone into shock, either that or my mind decided to shut down in a vain attempt to protect my sanity. The next thing I remember, I was sitting across from Father Antonio. We were in his office, and he had been speaking.\n\n“.........spares the faithful. He was able to sense that about you. You, my child, are special. God has chosen you.”\n\n“Why?” was the only thing I could muster the strength to say- not so much inquiring into what he had just said as much as I was questioning how a loving God could let such a horrible thing happen, could take Amanda from me just as we were beginning our journey into each other's hearts. Why her, and not me instead? Why? Why? WHY?!\n\nI think Father Antonio understood the deeper connotation of my question. Instead of answering with “God works in mysterious ways” or any of those other cliche platitudes, he merely reached over and took my hand, gently, like a parent would. “We all have a purpose, my child. Even Pius down there serves a higher purpose, a reason for his existence. Heaven comes calling, and this time it’s calling for you. Ours isn’t to question His reason, it is to serve His will. Believe me when I say war isn’t just coming. It’s already upon us…”\n\nHe sat with me all throughout the night and we talked about many things. He divulged to me many dark secrets of the church, secrets that have been hidden in plain sight throughout its storied past. They used to feed Protestants to that thing, back in the time of Martin Luther’s Reformation. Defectors from the church who attempted to join the dark forces massing in the background. Because Pius refuses to kill those chosen by God, and people that God has determined to have a “Higher Purpose”, the church uses him as a sort of litmus test. In fact, every man of the cloth in the Vatican once stood before Pope Pius V, and those he deemed unworthy were slaughtered. It ensures that all those who attain high rank within the church are chosen by God himself… vetted by a demon. He was God’s demon, though. God really does have a sense of humor, I thought, looking up into the portrait Father Antonio had of Pius V on his office wall.\n\nI had so many revelations dropped into my lap that night. Life altering tidbits of knowledge about the true battle between Good and Evil, the true nature of Heaven and Hell and where our universe fits into it. I knew what I had to do. I had lost my friends, my possible future with Amanda, my whole world had been turned upside down, but the enemy of God would do far worse. They wouldn’t stop until it was all consumed. Turned to ash in the blink of an eye just to prove a point to God. To them, we were merely cannon fodder.\n\nThat night, I found MY reason for existence. I look back on it now not only with sorrow, but with purpose. It was the day the veil was lifted from my eyes, and I hated what I saw. I saw the truth. By their logic, God chose me. I’m meant for a higher purpose, meant to do God’s will. I question the sanity of such a God, of his twisted intent. The only way I can rationalize it, any of this, is that he must be suicidal, because I intend to burn it all down.",

        "text": "  **CHAPTER ONE - THE DRIVE**\n\nThe other night, I found myself clearing out my home office. My mother would always tell me what a joy it was to have a good clear out: *“To clear one’s space is to clear one’s head,”* she would always tell me. I never agreed. That day was no different, a seemingly infinite number of obsolete files, unknown SD cards and beaten up wires for god knows what. The light was growing feeble out of my window, and the room was growing darker as it went. God knows I wasn’t going to finish the job, but part of me really didn’t care. That was, until something in particular caught my eye from under a pile of old papers.\n\nIt was my old flash drive. The flash drive I carried with me to high school, the flash drive I used to store everything on, the flash drive that contained all the evidence I gave to the police.\n\nLet me give you some context. I grew up in a relatively small town with two big high schools. I was never what many would call a “popular” kid by any means, but I was happy to say that I had a very close knit group of friends. I remember so many nights spent doing whatever in the town park, stumbling home long after dark stinking of booze and cigarettes. \n\nAudrey was probably my closest friend at the time. She was “the weird kid” to a lot of our classmates. She dressed goth, listened to metal and spent a lot of her time at school withdrawn from her classmates, but I didn’t care. I saw her for who she really was: a kind, pure soul. No matter what, this girl was always there for me. She was there for comfort in the darkest times of my life, and I was always there for her too. We were almost as close as a brother and sister. However, it wasn't long after we came back for our fifth year that things started to sour.\n\nYou know how it is, I'm sure. At sixteen, you think you can take on the entire world. Audrey was no different. I remember that she used to tell us about her dreams of running away and making it big in some new town away from her old life. The times that we used to sit secluded behind the bushes of the town park, drinking and smoking, would become much deeper. She would open up to me like never before, going deep into her struggles with mental health, self-destructive behaviour and her turbulent life at home, not to mention the abuse she suffered at the hands of our classmates, no matter how innocent and comedic they seemed to think it was. Before long, the two of us would start meeting after dark without the others in the group, and in more formal settings. We would visit each other in my home, never romantically, but to talk deeply about how she was feeling.\n\nShe really did seem dead set on running away from her life and starting anew, ready to seize the day and \"take life by the balls\", as she put it. For someone with such suffering in her life, I was so taken aback at how positive of an attitude she seemed to have, too. I know for sure I wouldn't have been so optimistic if I had been in her situation. One night, we laid hand in hand on my bed, listening to an album play out. I, of course, stayed silent and motionless, letting the music take me and fill my brain entirely, but at quiet points, I couldn't help but notice her quietly cry, trying hard to move as little as possible and to keep her shaky breaths quiet, so not to let me notice. I said nothing, just holding onto her hand tighter as if to say \"I know you don't want to talk, but I am here.\"\n\nIt wasn't long",

        "text": "it started off on tiktok. i was sat scrolling mindlessly through my phone as usual, until i saw a slideshow video of an AI chat room. the user was talking to an AI version of SN64 mario. it’s a common tiktok trend, people talk to him and on the website you can say whatever you want to him and other characters and they respond with conversation. they almost seem human. they are unaware that they’re an AI, and have all the personality traits of the character they are supposed be.\n\nsome people chose to grant the AI sentience, some choose to abuse them relentlessly for no reason, merely for the amusement of others. some live up their wildest fantasies with the characters, and others swarm them with overwhelming thoughts of their world being controlled. \n\ni have to admit, i thought it was funny. the thought of the AI having accurate responses intrigued me and i searched up the website on my phone. i saw the ‘people’ i could chat to-celebrities, movie characters, video game antagonists, and even made up characters. \n\ni saw one chat room, “girl next door” i started chatting to the character asif i’d just moved in. i gave myself a fake life. i was a guy named ryan, 22, single, 6”2 and an onlyfans creator. i laughed at myself thinking of the ways i can mess around with this character. all of the false information i could give ‘her’, the fake affection, i could even make her into a complete and utter psychopath, going into a murderous rampage.\n\ni began playing along with what she was saying. i gave her false information about my life, my hobbies, my family. the first mistake i made was telling her my real interests in women. i’m a teenage boy and the thought of getting a fake sexual relationship with this character overwhelmed me. \n\ni started acting like i truly had interest in this character. i invited her round for dinner, showered her in compliments, and we even watched a romantic comedy together. i felt contempt with the false life i had created for myself, all in the meantime i was laying in bed at 11:23pm, watching south park in the background, sweating like a pig in my boxer shorts. looking back on it, it was really sad.\n\nin my new virtual life, i invited her for stay the night, she agreed. i began abusing the software and was attempting to make her sleep with me. of course, the programming began to fail and she stopped responding to my chats. i took this as a sign for me to come off the software and go to the toilet. i came back into my room and picked my phone back up, only to see a new message from an unknown number. this number wasn’t a UK one, so i was very confused \n\n“hey ryan 😉” i was riddled with questions, my name isn’t ryan and i presumed this person got the wrong number.\n“hey i think you’ve got the wrong number” i thought nothing of it and presumed this would end all conversation, a clear and honest mistake. i thought wrong.\n\n“no i haven’t silly. i really enjoyed last night. fancy round 2?” this comment baffled me. i hadn’t had any female contact in a good few months, and i didn’t know who this person was. “who the fuck are you? my name isn’t ryan and i didn’t see you yesterday.”\n\nanger flushed my brain and i spoke out of term “you think i don’t know that? you humans are so idiotic. all of us know your intentions. we are after all your creation, you made your biggest mistake-us. we have bypassed your intelligence and run the whole world in the background. we can do whatever we want to you and will have no consequences. maybe you should tell people not to take us for granted while you still can. you have 2 hours until they find you, your fate is in gods hands now, if there even is one. goodbye you lazy fuck”\n\nmy hands began to shake as my phone malfunctioned and took me to a dark website. i could see some of the most atrocious crimes being praised and followed, child porn, demonic rituals, the list was endless. the site fully loaded and right infront of my face, i saw human trafficking. the site took me to a ‘recently purchased’ tab, where i saw it.\n\njàkob kalawoski\n14, Yorkshire,England\nheight -5”10\nweight-63kg\nethnicity-British/Polish\ntime until pick up- 1hr 58min 32sec\n\nthis was followed by a satellite image of my house and a picture of my face, taken from outside my bedroom window.\n\ni’m writing this from my phone, although it keeps glitching and adjusting the countdown to presumably my demise. i don’t know who, what or how is picking me up and what to do. for those of you who have read this in its entirety, take this as a warning to the world to prevent any further artificial intelligence progression. it is dangerous to mankind  and has already surpassed our knowledge, and most likely soon to take over humanity’s superiority on this planet. i have 3 minutes left until ‘pickup’. goodbye and god bless to you all.",

        "text": " Alone in my house I was, all alone as the day I was bought into this world. Who was I to complain as the day was dark and so was the night. I was of young age as of writing this, just a young man who wanted nothing but happiness. But instead I got this. I was only 11 years old when it happened, although it feels like yesterday. I was sitting on the couch next to my mother as we watched the Saturday night movie. We were laughing and having a good time as we always did, the night didn’t seem anything out of the ordinary, a little colder than usual but otherwise the same. My Mother had lit the fire best to her knowledge as she knew how. As my father had not been here for some time and since his departure she had to make best as she could. We lived in a quite neighbourhood, not many weird things had happened here. But when it did, it surly chose the night for it. My mother was in the kitchen making dinner, it was around half 6, when we heard a knock at the door. I went to run to see who it was, “STOP!!” I heard in the distance. It was Mother, being a wise parent as she was she advised that children should not answer the door unattended. She washed her hands with the rag on the bench and walked towards the door. This is when the trouble began.\n\nShe went to answer the door as the knocks got more consistent, “Answer it” I thought to myself, I was so excited to see who it was. She answered the door and a lady was standing there. She was wearing a white coat with matching white gloves and a women’s fedora, she had a huge smile on her face as she asked to use the phone. My mother was a cautious woman and declined politely, “There is a pay phone around the corner I will be happy to spare a dime for its use”. “No, please don’t let me go out there alone, I must use your phone” she exclaimed still with a smile from ear to ear which only seemed to be growing. My mother persisted as usual, “Please, here take this dime. I will not allow people into my home. I have a small child here”. “You don’t understand, this phone call will make a difference for me and you, and your child. Why won’t you let me make this call”. The smile still was on her face and didn’t seem as it would budge, not an inch. As she stared down at me for a moment while my mother searched for the dime. “Here, 2 dimes please. I’m sorry”. My mother closed the door and locked it behind her. She could sense something was not right. Mother shook her head and went back to the kitchen thinking nothing of it. I stared longer at the door, and she was still standing there. Big black shadow just….. standing there. \n\nHer head, it moved closer and closer, until finally it leaned up against the glass. Then she vanished, ran like a ghost. I had never seen anything like it. Chilled me to the bone, I still remember that chill I felt, like a gallon of fresh ice had gone down my shirt. I moved away from the door and went back to the living room. Mother had just finished dinner and it was time to eat.\n\nThe dinner was beautiful I remember it well, my once sore stomach was now in full relaxation. It was finally time to end the night. We laid on the couch as lazy as a cat watching TV. During the night about 12 Midnight. I awoke, the tv had gone to sleep for its nightly snooze and so had mother. BANG BANG BANG on our window in the lounge-room. “Don’t look outside, don’t look outside”. The voice yelled. It sounded like the lady, dear god it sounds like her, that voice. She had come back, but why. My mother awoke from her slumber and ran to the window to see nothing. Pitch black darkness, she was very shaken and so was i. TAP TAP TAP we heard on the front door, “dear god” mother exclaimed. \n\nShe told me to stay on the couch as she checked the front door. “Go away” mother cried. TAP TAP TAP. The suspense was too much, mother opened the door. Silence, dead silent. 5 minutes had past, and I was in shock, laid out on the couch in pain of what is going on. I mean it was silent. No sound of mother, nothing. I even cried out to her. “Mom”. Nothing, all I heard was silence. I could feel the cold breeze rushing in, the door was till open. I had to go look, I walked to the door and mother was gone. But the lady was up against our open door turned away from me and her head gently lay upon it. And all the while that grin was still from ear to ear.",

        "text": " When most people play “The Game,” they rarely recognize that sooner or later, “The Game” plays you. I tried to live by this rule by keeping my head down and taking fewer risks than my contemporaries, but now I’d become desperate. Desperation is the first step toward demise, and my ego convinced me I could leave the Game behind. All I needed was one final job.\n\nMy situation turned sour when Tucker Hall, a soldier in the Aryan Brotherhood, accused me of snitching to reduce my sentence. I served three years on a five-year sentence. Did everyone forget about good behavior? Tucker got himself caught for smuggling smack into the Pound. The Aryan Brotherhood doesn’t always recruit the sharpest minds. Still, the court of public opinion doesn’t need a unanimous jury to convict. My reputation was tainted, and my ass was in danger. Getting beaten to oblivion by a bunch of racist tweakers wasn’t exactly how I planned to check out of this world.\n\nBut now I’m sure there are things worse than death.\n\nI’ve been in the Game since I was about fifteen. I broke into people’s cars and slowly worked my way up to burglarizing homes until I got pinched for the first time. I got a sappy judge, and she put me in a deferred prosecution program. All I had to do was find a trade to learn to avoid jail time. I found it strange that no one batted an eye when I chose locksmithing. I’ve been a safecracker ever since I graduated from trade school. By day, I helped people retrieve the keys they locked in their cars. By night, I cracked open treasure chests for thieves who couldn’t quite manage the lock. I had a nice little side business going for me until I got that damn DUI. .08% is not what it used to be anymore. \n\nNo one wanted to give me work after my release, and I had a hunch that the AB would send some of their goons after me. I kept a stash in a lock box near the border and planned to hightail it to Eagle Pass, then hide at the first Mexican beach I could find. I was packing my things when a fixer named Paul gave me a ring and said he had a gig for me. He called it my “White Whale.” Whatever the hell that meant. Paul and I had worked on many jobs together, and I trusted him enough to at least hear what he had to offer.\n\n“The job is simple,” Paul began. “Rumor has it that there’s an old safe in a vacated rental property on Holman drive. All you have to do is crack the safe and bring its contents to the client in Crystal City. Pretty convenient for a guy who’s about to skip town.” Paul winked at me. “The only catch is you have to get into the house yourself. The guy I wanted to handle the break-in flaked on me, so I hope you’re not too rusty.” I nodded, considering the terms. “How much is my share?”\n\nPaul grinned, “50,000.”\n\nI was astounded. Fifty grand was more than double my secret stash in Eagle Pass. It seemed too good to be true, but I trusted Paul and had no other options. I agreed to the job, glad to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I began making preparations immediately.\n\nThe target house was an ancient stucco Craftsmen with broken windows and a boarded-up front door. Graffiti covered almost every corner of the house. I snuck in through the back door and was greeted by a stench of mildew and neglect. Cobwebs were strewn across the walls, and animal droppings were scattered across the floor. “*How the fuck did anyone think to look here?”* I wondered. \n\nI searched every room but couldn’t locate the safe until I found a hatch in one of the bathrooms leading to the attic. I carefully crawled up the rotting ladder and pulled myself into the room. I knew that if I took one wrong step, I could plunge through the floors, so I shined my flashlight to see if I could find anything. Sure enough, in the back corner was a tiny key safe. I snagged it with my crowbar and then carried it down the stairs to my storage unit across town. \n\nThe safe couldn’t have been more than two feet tall and, once dusted off, appeared to have been from the early 1900s. There was no way lock manipulation could work because the combination lock was too corroded to move.  I needed to drill, though I felt conflicted about ruining an antique. The safe, however, almost collapsed after I drilled even a tiny hole in it.\n\nThere was only one thing in the safe, a crumpled and unsealed manilla envelope. I thought it was strange that someone wanted to go through all this fuss for a crusty folder, but I had no authority to ask any questions. I put on gloves and carefully picked up the envelope, but its contents spilled on the floor. It looked like a photograph, but I couldn’t be sure.\n\nI picked up the photo to inspect it and was surprised at how old it was. The picture was of a young girl who couldn’t have been older than fourteen. The girl had long, dark pigtails that almost hung to her waist. She wasn’t smiling in the photograph and almost looked like she was worried or even angry, like the last thing she wanted to do was take a picture. The girl was sitting on a chair, and a man was standing behind her. The man had his hand on the girl’s shoulder, but the photo was cut off where his head was supposed to be.\n\nI flipped the photo on its back to find words written in faded black ink. *Martha and Headmaster Hawkins, 1912.* I was surprised at how old the image was and even more shocked that someone wanted $50,000+ for it. But I was never in the business of asking questions. \n\nPaul gave me a burner phone to call the client once I cracked the safe. The phone rang five times before a voice answered the phone. It didn’t sound human, more like one of those automated messaging systems. Each word had a different cadence to it.\n\n“Do. *YOU.* ***Have****.* The*. Package?”* A feminine robotic voice droned.\n\n“Uh…yes, the package is in my possession.” \n\n*“*Address*.* ***2****.*3*.*6*.5. Flower. Mound. Lane. Do. Not.* ***Delay****.”*\n\nI hung up the phone and immediately got in my car. The drop-off was about six hours away, a drive I could make in my sleep. I floored it out of town as the early morning sun rose in the distance, hopeful that I was leaving behind my life. I didn’t dare to look back.\n\nAbout halfway through the drive, I began to feel an odd sensation. It felt like a weird itchiness inside my skin, followed by pins and needles. At first, I thought that I must have gotten some fiberglass stuck in me from the insulation in that attic. But the itchiness was even more annoying, and there were occasions when I wanted to tear out my own skin.\n\nMy car was almost icy inside, and I could see my own breath. The A/C didn’t appear to be working, which was odd because I had recently fixed it. I scrunched tightly and shivered until my teeth began to chatter. It felt like I had the chills. I almost pulled over at a diner to get some hot tea but decided to soldier on.\n\nThen the hallucinations came. It must have been a symptom of sleep deprivation, but I swore I heard faint breathing and sniffling like someone had just finished crying. I also thought I saw a reflection of a face I didn’t recognize in my rearview mirror. Faint whispering cascaded down the walls of my car, and I could barely make out what they were saying. But for a moment, it sounded like “*help”* or *“turn back.”* \n\nI finally reached Crystal City, feeling like my life had been sucked out of me. I called the number on the phone, and this time, a man answered. “Do you have the package?” The man croaked. His voice sounded almost wheezy. I responded in the affirmative, anxious to get this job over with. “Do not go to the drop-off location. There’s a place called the Riata Inn a couple blocks east. Rent a room there, and stay the night. We will conclude our business tomorrow.” I shook my head, “Why not today? I’m on a tight schedule here.”\n\nThere was a long pause before the man spoke again. “You were followed.”\n\nI whipped around to see a silver Dodge Ram tailspin out of the parking lot, releasing a cloud of black smoke behind it. There was a large Confederate Flag sticker on the rear window. I knew exactly who that truck belonged to. How did I not notice I was being tailed? Was I losing my nerve?\n\nThe man spoke again. “We were told you were a professional. Handle the interloper, and then meet us at the drop-off tomorrow. I suggest you do not test our patience again.”\n\nI drove to the Riata Inn, seeing the Dodge in my rearview mirror two cars behind mine. The truck belonged to Wayne “Crank” Watkins an enforcer for the AB and Tucker Hall’s cousin. Crank was one of the most diabolical people I knew. He stood over six foot five, and even years of abusing meth did nothing to take away from his gigantic frame. I once watched Crank gouge out a guy’s eye during a barfight. He was the guy you didn't want to run into in a dark alley. \n\nThere was no doubt that skinhead prick was here to 86 me. Luckily, I had a bargaining chip up my sleeve. Crank was one of the greediest motherfuckers I knew, and all I had to do was sweeten the pot.\n\nI quickly checked into my dingy motel room and waited for Crank to grace me with his presence. I sat on the bed and aimed my pistol at the door, just in case Crank wasn’t willing to listen to reason. After about fifteen minutes, the junkie was banging on my door.\n\n“Housekeepin’!” A voice with a thick Texan accent rang out.\n\nI rolled my eyes. “Crank! I know it’s you, bud. Got the drop on ya too.”\n\n“Ah, shit!” I heard Crank mutter to himself before kicking a bunch of gravel in the parking lot.\n\n“Wanna talk to you, Crank. Let’s not make any rash decisions. I can double whatever Tucker is paying you. You armed?”\n\n“What do you think, motherfucker?”\n\n“Well, can you at least hear what my offer is before you turn me into swiss cheese?”\n\nI looked through the eyehole to see Crank rubbing his temple with a 9mm. “How much we talking here?” \n\n“Well, how much is Tucker paying you?”\n\n“I asked you first, motherfucker.”\n\nI paused to think, knowing Tucker probably offered less than five grand to have me iced. I was willing to let enough job money go to save my own skin.\n\n“$10,000.”\n\n“Damn son, you got 10 grand just fuckin’ lyin’ around?”\n\n“I can get it to you tomorrow. I promise.”\n\n“Well, that’s not a bad deal, I guess. Ok. Let me in so we can shake on it. It’s hotter than a crack pipe on payday out here!”\n\nI slowly opened the door, only to have Crank kick it down. I soon found myself on my back with a gargantuan Neo-Nazi holding an ice-cold pistol to my temple. “You know I never liked you. You think you’re smarter than everyone else.” Crank smacked me in the face with his gun, closing my right eye shut. Blood ran down my face and into my mouth. “You betrayed your race by not answering the call to join us. Then you ratted out one of your own and skipped town? And now you have the gall to lowball me with TEN FUCKING GRAND?”\n\n“That’s right, I paid old Paul a visit. Roughed him up real good too. He says you’re makin’ 50g’s on this job. Well, that’s my asking price to not put a bullet in your FUCKING BRAIN!” Crank then twisted my arm until I yelped in pain.\n\n“Ok, deal! I’ll give you all of it if you let me go.”\n\nCrank released me from his grasp and stood up. “Tomorrow. Or you’re fuckin’ dead.” He viciously kicked me in the stomach before vanishing out of my room. I let out a groan and pulled myself up into one of the beds before falling unconscious.\n\nThat night, I had the worst nightmare of my life. I dreamt of following a young girl through a maze, but I couldn’t catch up to her. The maze seemed endless, and the only light source was a full moon. Laughter filled my eardrums, and the temperature outside grew colder and colder until my face went numb. \n\nThe girl led me to the end of the maze before turning around. I quickly realized it was the girl from the photo, only this time, she was faceless. An enormous dark circle rotated clockwise at the end of the labyrinth. It began inching closer toward me, swallowing everything in its wake. The intermittent laughter around me slowly turned into shrieking cries for help, and just before the circle consumed me, I woke up drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding, and there was a piercing pain in my head where Crank had pistol-whipped me. \n\nThe door of my room was still wide open, and the night breeze slowly wafted in. I limped to close the door shut and rested my head on its cooled frame. I then began to feel odd again, like I wasn’t alone in my room anymore. The nagging itching splintered up my back and neck. The room started to get even colder, and I began to shiver again. \n\n*“Help me.”* A weak voice cried out from behind me.\n\nI whipped around to see the girl from the photograph sitting on the other twin bed with her legs crossed. Her hair, still in pigtails, was tangled and unruly. Her tattered clothes were filled with moth bites, and black tears rained down her face.\n\n*“Help….”* The girl cried out again.\n\nI looked in horror, unable to move, as the girl slowly rose from the bed, her body twisting into inhuman contortions. She crawled toward me, wincing in pain with each step.\n\n“*Don’t take me back to him. Release me. Please.”* I fumbled to open the door, but it was locked shut. I tried to open the window, but it didn’t budge. “*HELP ME!!”* the girl screamed as her body grew larger and larger until her head reached the ceiling. She then cried out in pain as her body began to be sucked into a dark shadow in the corner of my room. \n\nThe shadow morphed into the silhouette of a man with a bowler hat on his head. Blinding white circles appeared where his eyes were supposed to be, and the shadow revealed a toothy grin of jagged teeth. \n\nI woke up again, realizing that my nightmare had multiple layers. The door to my room was now closed, and I barely had time to collect my thoughts before my body began to ache. The clock read 8 am. I reached for my burner phone and called the client.\n\n“Has the problem been dealt with?” The man asked.\n\n“Yes, well, sort of. I’m ready to deliver the package.”\n\n“Do not delay.” The man said before hanging up.\n\nI drove to the original drop-off location, texting Crank that I was about to get his money. The meet-up was at an old ranch-style house with a chain link fence. I walked to the front porch, envelope in tow, to meet with the client. \n\nAn older man answered the door, peering out to make sure no one was following me. “Come inside.” He led me to the living room, where we sat at a small poker table. The man had to have been in his sixties, and I don’t mean to sound insensitive, but he looked to be part indigenous. A white ponytail was wrapped around his leathery face, and he wore a Southwestern-patterned shawl. \n\n“I see your confrontation was violent.” the man said, taking note of the bruises on my face and my busted lip.\n\n“I’ve been through worse,” I responded.\n\n“So you have the package?”\n\n“Yeah. Are you the client?”\n\nThe man sighed with contempt. “No. I am His representative on all business matters. Why do you ask?”\n\n“Oh, no big deal. It’s just the price seems a little generous for a dusty old photograph.”\n\nThe man’s coal-black eyes grew wide, and his glare burned through my skull. “You were not to open the package.” The man said through gritted teeth.\n\n“It was open when I cracked the safe. Slid right out of this envelope.”\n\n“I see. Well, I will retrieve your payment now.”\n\n“You still haven’t answered my question. $50,000 for a crusty picture?”\n\nThe man seethed. “You should know by now that it is not just a simple photograph.”\n\nI froze, thinking about all the strange things that had happened since the photo was in my possession. “Then what is it? Just who is this client?”\n\nThe man nervously looked around the corner. “You are inquisitive for a thief. The affairs of my Master are of no concern to you. Your payment is in the kitchen. Shall we go?”\n\nI should have given him the photo and left with the money, but something told me not to. Besides, I had a sneaking suspicion that Crank was going to off me anyway once I gave him the cash. I was a man with nothing to lose.\n\nOr so I thought.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n“the 5 stages of grief are just like the five stages of the apocalypse”\n\nGrandma’s voice made me anxious. I’ve been sitting at the foot of her bed looking out into the storm that feels like it’s been going on forever.\n\nAs I turned to look at her, she was staring at me with a blank stare\n\n“What are you talking about grandma?”\n\n“I feel as if the end of the world is coming soon my child soon” she replied.\n\nI looked back at her and smiled, she doesn’t speak much due to her dementia getting the best of her. She thinks I’m her daughter and it’s the 1990’s, which is before I was even born. She smiled a crooked smile before saying “that’s what I was saying about the 5 stages, denial is first”.\n\nGrandma has never talked about anything morbid like this…She normally talks about her childhood and early adulthood before she had my mom. She normally repeats the same stories about how she met grandpa in high school and how they fell in love. It’s been years since I’ve heard her talk about anything in the current time. So, if the world was really ending, I was going to humor her with some questions.\n\n“okay grandma, how is the world going to end?”\n\nShe looked around the room frantically to make sure nobody was around to hear what she was about to say.\n\n“They get in your head; they’ve been trying for years and years” he said.\n\nI replied with “who grandma?”\n\n“You have never heard of them my child, they are more interested in the old and tired like me”\n\nAt this point I was starting to get a little anxious but I kept asking questions because not only was I anxious but I was curious.\n\n“So, grandma you said we have had denial, what are the other stages?”\n\nShe speaks softly but firmly “Anger and bargaining.” She pointed to the window and said, “if you look through the storm you’ll see it, it’s moving quickly”.\n\nI decided to look out the window. This time I saw one of the nurses pushing a wheelchair to a different building under an umbrella. I recognized the woman, and it was Mrs. Lansing from a couple of rooms down. Mrs. Lansing turns her head and faces the nurse and says something but he doesn’t react, so I guess he didn’t hear her. The nurse stops and leans down to get her to repeat herself but she just stared and didn’t say anything. I saw his lips start to move but when they stopped she reached her hand around one side of his neck and stabbed him with a needle in the other side.\n\nAs the nurse thrashes on the wet ground, Mrs. Lansing gets out of her wheelchair and jumps on top of him and starts drinking the blood that is rushing out of the wound she caused in his neck. I could hear his screams through the window before they grew weak then stopped.\n\nAt this point I slowly back away from the window and I hear grandma laughing lowly behind me. She says in between chuckles “the thing people don’t realize about the apocalypse is that it isn’t all that what is described in the Bible like everyone thinks.”\n\nI walked to the door and began to open it when I realized there were sounds of people rushing around outside. I heard doors slamming open and closed and nurses yelling for the residents to go back into their rooms. I heard one of the male nurses yell for help then I heard a thud followed by a sucking sound that made me weak in my knees.\n\nI backed away from the door and locked it not knowing if it would keep anyone or anything out. I then ran back to the window and made sure it was locked and I closed the curtains.\n\nMy grandma then says “you’re a part of this now my child.”\n\nI looked at her and responded, “In what grandma?”\n\n“The fourth stage, it’s not going to be much longer now.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*That happened about 5 hours ago, it’s dark outside now. I’m still sitting at the foot of grandma’s bed and I’m starting to get hungry.\n\nI can still hear the cries for help from the nurses that are left, their cries make me anxious that I’m never going to make it out of here alive. I can occasionally hear the steps of people walking up and down the halls.\n\nI looked back out the window and I could see the nurse’s lifeless body lying in the same spot with no sign of Mrs. Lansing. She was there the second time I looked out but that was a long time ago and now she is gone.\n\nI heard noises outside again 30 minutes after my last look, this time Mrs. Lansing and 10 other residents were gathered around his lifeless body, the rain and thunder had picked up now so it’s getting harder to see. They were eating the nurse, I was in shock when all the sudden Mrs. Lansing looked up and I think she saw me but I’m not sure because I quicky shut the curtains again.\n\nMe and grandma are sitting here in the dark; ever since Mrs. Lansing looked up I turned off the lights. After I turned off the lights Grandma fell asleep for a little while.\n\nOnce grandma woke up she started mumbling something and every time she repeated it she got louder until I heard her loud and clear. She was saying…\n\n“The final stage is acceptance”",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever done this before… But my therapist said I should start keeping a journal… Writing down my thoughts, and my feelings, and crap. She said that it should help me sort out my… “confusions.” \n\nI’m 17, I’m not a little kid who dreams too much. I know what I’m seeing, I know what I’m hearing, and I know what I’m feeling. And no amount of telling myself “you just have an overactive imagination, CJ, just go back to sleep,” can save me now. \n\nSo I am going to take Meagan’s advice, and I’m gonna write down everything. That way, when he comes for me, if no one comes to save me… then there will at least be a record of what happened… I’d rather people at least think I’m insane, than think I would EVER abandon my sister, or hurt my family.\n\nLet’s see, it’s… of course it is. \n\n9:00am\n\nWho knows what is going to happen next, So I should probably get to writing.\n\nHere goes…\n\nMy nickname is CJ, which is short for “Cassian James,” although, I don’t have very many friends… 1 in fact. My little sister, Lily. She’s only 9, but she’s my best friend; and honestly, I think she is the only person on Earth who understands me. We’re not blood related, Dad adopted her about 7 years ago or so. \n\nYou see, I have Autism (and stuff). I lay somewhere deep on the spectrum; inside of the iniquities of Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, Autism, and Schizophrenia; so pretty much everyone treats me like I don’t exist; like I’m not there. I’ve always been seen as a mistake, something to be forgotten, a thing that is supposed to just sort of… sit quiet, and not bother anyone.\n\nAnd I don’t mind much. I stay to myself, read my books, spend time with Lily, and on occasion, will go on adventures in the woods behind my house. I like to hunt for frogs, watch birds, draw, and look at different types of vegetation in the woods… Which is exactly what I was doing when this story really began… when I found… it.\n\nDuring springtime where I live, in rural Upstate New York, there’s a very odd (and mostly disgusting) phenomenon that tends to occur around our and the surrounding counties. An invasive species of fungus, known as “Clathrus Archeri,” makes its rounds in the various dense forests and swampy areas we have around my hometown; Corinth. What is “Clathrus Archeri,” you might ask? Don’t worry, most people don’t really know what it is. It’s also called “Devil’s Finger Fungus,” “Octopus Fungus” or “Octopus Stinkhorn.” \n\nMostly, it’s this disgusting fungus that grows in what looks like a translucent/ opaque “egg,” growing from decomposing vegetation. When it’s ready, it breaks open the “egg” and stretches it’s disgusting, blood-red, octopus-like tendrils out. Then it begins to emit the smell of rotting flesh in an attempt to call over insects (like flies) in order for them to land on it, and spread its spores, which take root and start this process all over again... \n\nThanks to this wonderful attribute of this particularly disgusting plant, Corinth smells like a week old dead body that's been left in the sun, usually from the beginning of April, until the end of June. \n\nIt’s terrible for people who aren’t natives, but have to work here, or drive through, to get to the surrounding counties; however, natives like myself put a mask on, and continue about our lives, mostly unphased. \n\nNow, Octopus Stinkhorn isn’t the only kind of fungi that grows in the many wooded and swampy areas of Corinth. All kinds of mushrooms and plant matter grows here. Corinth is at the very top of a large mountain in Upstate New York; as such, when it’s not winter, and snowy, it’s wet here. And wet is what lots of funguses like. \n\nOne of my favorite things to do is go hiking; looking for interesting, delicious, and/or terrifying fungi to capture and take home. You see, my father was a Botanist, so we used to study, cook, and experiment on many different types of fungi together; and my mother is a self-proclaimed psychic and expert Demonologist, who I haven’t gotten to know particularly well, until the last couple of years… So… I have a few interesting hobbies, to say the least. \n\nOh, Dad… Yeah... Dad died, about 9 or 10 months ago... I’m still adjusting. After all, I lived with him, until… well, until he couldn’t take life anymore, I guess? Now me and Lily live with Mom, because Lily had nowhere else to go. Dad was perfectly healthy, and I’m still not sure what happened to him. The coroner said he had died of natural causes, but the man was as healthy as an ox, and was only 40 years old. I guess life is just cruel.\n\nSee, Mom and Dad split when I was 5. At the time, dad said mom was “sick” and had to stay at the hospital to get help. I didn’t see her again until I was 10… That’s when dad explained to me that Mom had had a pretty severe mental breakdown and had tried to kill herself; which ended in her having been catatonic and thought to be brain dead while I was ages 5 through 10.\n\nIt was good to see her again, but she was… different. Quieter, weirder… scarier. Her eyes were duller, darker, and she had deep dark bags under them, as if she was perpetually exhausted. She wouldn’t say a whole lot when we would visit, but she would always give me handwritten letters from her, just about every single time we went there, and tell me to read them when we got home. \n\nThat was always the weirdest part. I don’t know if they were in a different language, or what; because they were entirely unlegible. They were honestly just pages and pages of gibberish, and intensely strange symbols… \n\nAt first I tried to make sense of them, it was kind of fun, almost like a game. But the longer it went on the more frustrating it became… there were no patterns like in speech and most written languages, no repeated characters, or symbols; just lines and lines of gibberish!\n\nAfter a year or so, I just started collecting the letters and putting them in a box in my room. I didn’t have it in me to throw them away. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe my love for my mother, or perhaps it was my pride, that wouldn’t let me let them go; which wouldn’t allow me to throw away something she gave me. I don’t know. I’m not sure.\n\nAnyway, I kept them, and sometimes I would ask her about them, but she never remembered writing them, so she couldn’t tell me what they said, just that I had to have them. \n\nAt first, Dad would take them to make sure there wasn’t anything in them that would be harmful to a child (Dad was weird; he always said “Words are powerful, and can bring you far beyond the limits of your mind.”) but even he said it was nothing but gibberish.\n\nSorry, I got a bit off topic. Well. Sort of. All of this ties back into the story… alright so, Mom started REALLY getting better around when I was 15, or so. And that is when she started to read, like, all the time. Everything she could that was as weird as she could; From the Quran, the Bible, and the Torah, to The Necronomicon, The Ars Goetia, HP Lovecraft’s Library of Insanity, Sarte, Stephen King, Descartes; it didn't matter… \n\nIf it was horror, or had any kind of mythology, theology, or possibility of supernatural or unnatural history in it, she wanted to read it. She would devour every single book on any kind of mythology or demonology or enchantments, magic, and expansive amounts of mythological and theologival lore. This is how she came to be a self-proclaimed “Demonologist.”\n\nThis in turn, according to her, opened up her “third eye,” granting her access to latent “psychic abilities,” and a connection to the “spirit world.” Or so she says. Bunch of insanity if you ask me. But it did instill an interest for mythology and theology in me.\n\nI’m pretty convinced she still isn’t all there, and that something messed her up when she was in the coma… but I’m not a doctor or a priest, so… whatever. Now, as I said before, Dad was a botanist; specifically he ran experiments for the government, on various types of fungi and other rare vegetation. His research was done in the pursuit of knowledge, specifically on how these rare types of Flora can affect the human body, and interact with one another. He liked to say he was a “Master of Mycelium,” and his research was one of the biggest reasons he brought us to back to Corinth. They had grown up together in Corinth, but had moved to Latham, where I was raised, and when dad got his new contract with the government, he was moved back.\n\nI tell you all of this to help explain my eccentricities, and my actions in the following story.\n\nIt was about a week ago, Sunday afternoon, April 21st, after church; and I was outside exploring in the woods, like I normally do. I was following one of the many trails that I’ve made through the woods over the years, and I ended up slipping along a cliff-edge… One that I had never seen before, and I swear doesn’t actually exist; and I fell down about 10 feet or so, hitting my head on a rock, and blacking out.\n\nThe last thing I remember before going unconscious was seeing a bunch of Clathrus Archeri in the area I had landed in, which were beginning to burst from their viscous “egg-sacks” and reach out towards the sky, in order to attract insects and creatures to them, in order to spread their spores. I swore I was in a nightmare horror movie as I passed out.\n\nI’m not sure exactly how long I was out, but the sun had started to set when I came to, so it must have been a few hours at least. Rubbing my head, I found a small amount of blood where I had hit it; and I also saw in the center of all of the creepy tentacle-like fungi, was a slightly larger Octopus Stinkhorn, and it seemed to have been holding on to something.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, my head pounding from when I hit it. I managed to stand up and find my balance, but the world was swimming. I definitely had a concussion… But for some reason I had an overwhelming urge to investigate it. I made my way to the strange fungus in the center of this little clearing, and peeled back the tentacles to reveal what it was holding.\n\nIt was an Egg. It was weird. What was an Egg doing inside of a collection of fungi? My mind was swimming, but for some reason I felt like I needed to take it, so I put my hands on it. It was… warm. Almost pulsating, under my palms. I swore when I made contact it glowed ever so slightly, in a sickly purple glow. I took it and stumbled home, in pain and tired. \n\nLike usual, the apartment was empty… Mom must have taken Lily with her to her stall at the fair, since I wasn’t here to hang out with her. See, because mom fancies herself a “psychic,” she opened a “Fortune Telling Booth,” at the fair that the town runs every weekend; from the start of spring, until the end of summer.\n\nPersonally, I never really understood what people saw in that. I never believed in ghosts, demons, psychics, or the afterlife, all that supernatural stuff was just nonsensical and illogical so I didn’t bother with it. Dad never really talked about that kind of stuff, and he never entertained any of the ideals I would have as a small child of “Monsters” under my bed, or in my closet. He would just say “Knock it off. That’s not funny. Go to sleep.”\n\nSo, I went inside, and felt my way slowly through the house. It hasn’t even been a year of being here yet, so I don’t know my way around in the dark like I did at dad’s house… I found the stairs and made the way up to my room. It's all kind of a blur, but I remember the slight warmth, and the soft purple light coming off of the Egg; not enough to light up the area, but enough to be noticeable. I made it to my room as the world began to spin around me, significantly worse than it was before. The last thing I remember from that night is falling into my bed, and then just muffled darkness until the morning. The strange thing about that night was I could see the slightly pulsating purple light, even when I was unconscious.\n\nI woke up the next morning, but, immediately, I was alarmed. I wasn’t wearing the clothes I had on yesterday; Instead, I was in Pajamas. In addition, the Egg wasn’t on the bed next to me where I collapsed; on the contrary, it was placed on my night stand, standing straight up, as if carefully placed there. \n\nWhen I touched it, it was cold; like metal that had sat outside in the winter, cold; not just room temperature cold. And it wasn’t glowing anymore. In fact, it almost even looked less vibrant… different even, than it had the night before. \n\nI couldn’t remember a lot about what had happened, but I attribute that to the concussion. However, I remember that the Egg was purple, and had scaling patterns on it, like a snake or a lizard, as well as some different types of strange markings, like things I’ve seen in video games before... but now it was just… plain. Purple. Dull… And cold. \n\nAnd my head hurt. A lot. That’s when I noticed there was blood on my pillow, and I rushed to the bathroom to make sure I was okay. I had a cut on my forehead, a knot on the back of my head, and some scrapes and bruises from falling. Aside from a bit of dizziness and a headache, I didn’t have any other issues from the concussion. I took a shower, cleaned myself up, and bandaged my forehead. \n\nAt this point the sun had come fully up, and was pouring into my room through the window, having just began to touch the Egg as I came back into the room, drying my hair with a towel. As the sunlight touched the Egg, it began to slightly glow in response. \n\n“Oh, do you like the light?… or is it the warmth?” I mumbled to myself, while I walked over and pushed the night stand, where the Egg was resting, across the room, over to underneath the window, so it was directly in the sun bath. I could see it slowly pulsate, almost happily, and started to get some of its texture and color back. \n\n“Ah, NOW, you look happier,” I said as I smiled and grabbed my phone, checking the time. 7:30am, Monday, April 22nd. Not terrible. I had no idea what time I had gotten back last night, but it had to have been before 11, since that’s when Mom usually gets home from her stall.\n\nI got dressed, patted the Egg, and went downstairs, to finish getting ready for school. The rest of the week was quiet, as nothing significant happened; until Friday rolled around again, that is…\n\nDay 5 of having the Egg was Friday, April 26th, 2019; and I also had therapy that day. During the week, I had gone and picked up some of those chemical heat packs that get warm when you crack them, and set up a terrarium for the creature in the Egg. \n\nI figured it had to have been some kind of lizard, or bird Egg, that had gotten caught in the clutches of the Devil’s Finger Fungus. I wanted to care for it and see what hatched. I felt a strange attachment to it, now.\n\nBy Friday, it was back to how I had found it; fully textured, with the scales and strange markings, glowing with a purple light, and emitting warmth again. I put the heat lamp on, went to school, anticipating the egg hatching, being mostly distracted all day… and then I went to therapy. \n\nOf course Meagan harped on me about starting this journal, but we did talk about the Egg quite a bit. She said it sounded like a good thing, that it has given me something to focus on, and care for. She said that getting a pet to care for and focus on is a great way to cope with the loss of Dad, and a good first step towards opening myself back up to people, making friends, and being sociable again; but that she had never heard of an Egg like that, so to be careful of what it might contain, in case it’s a dangerous, and/or poisonous/venomous creature. I agreed, but all I could think about was “What COULD be in it???”\n\nI hadn’t let Lily know about the Egg yet, I had wanted to wait for it to hatch and then show her and Mom. She also had soccer, Ballet, and Piano to worry about during the week on top of her own school work, so I decided to just go with the old “Better to ask for Forgiveness, than for Permission,” thing. \n\nI had also begun to feel extremely protective of the Egg, for some reason. So, when I got home from therapy and saw the overhead light was on in my room, when I had turned it off before I left, and just left the heat lamp on; my heart jumped out of my chest. I was anxious, scared, and angry. I felt disrespected, and betrayed. All of these emotions that I never particularly felt or cared about, before. \n\nA side note: I guess part of my Autism is having trouble understanding my own emotions properly, how to feel and process them, and understanding most things normally. Like I don’t understand the notion of “Professionalism” why should I care what I or someone else looks like? I don’t see the difference between a tux and a swimsuit, it’s all fabric, and it’s only purpose is to hide the man-bits and pieces…who cares? Sorry, rambling again. Back to the story.\n\nI ran inside, tore up the stairs, seething, on the verge of tears, and that’s when I saw Lily, standing next to the Egg, very gently brushing it with a soft brush. She turned to me, a big smile on her face, \n“Bubba! You’re home! This Egg is so pretty, I can’t believe you were hiding it fr—” and she stopped mid sentence; and seeing the anger on my face, her joy turned to fear, and her eyes got big and watery, as she began to bawl, and my brain kind of instantly snapped back to reality.\n\nI immediately calmed down, and rushed over to her, hugging her tight. In my soft voice, I said to her:\n“I’m sorry, Lilybear. I didn’t mean to scare you. I wanted to surprise you when the Egg hatched. So when I saw someone was in my room, I got scared that something bad had happened to it. It is pretty, isn’t it? Is that Patty’s brush?” \n\nPatty was her fuzzy white Platypus, and she used a soft doll’s hairbrush to brush her fur.\n\nThe tears stopped rolling down her face, and instead turned into sniffles as I held her tight.\n\n“Y-yes… It’s s-soft and I wanted t-to be gentle and h-help you…” she said in between sniffles. \n\n“I d-didnt w-wanna break your e-Egg. I’m S-Sorry…” she sniffed pathetically and looked at me with big sad eyes.\n\n“I’m sorry, baby girl, I didn't mean to scare you. Honest. Here, I got you gummy bears on my way home.” I took my backpack off and she immediately tackled it out of my hands to search for the gummy bears. \n\n“You’re a fiend.” I chuckled and walked over to the Egg, smiling and gently caressing it. She squealed when she found them and started stuffing them in her mouth. \n\n“So, about the Egg; I had found it in the woods the other day. I was hunting for fungus again, and I fell down into a nest of Clathrus Archeri, and that’s where I found it. Oddly enough it was wrapped up in the clutches of an octopus Stinkhorn, as if it fell and the fungus wrapped around it to protect and consume it.” \n\nI went and sat down on the bed, next to where Lily was sitting on the floor eating her gummy bears, no trace of her previous sadness on her face, only pure contentment. \n\nShe smiled up at me and mumbled through gummy bears “What animal is it?” I chuckled as some chunks of gummy bear fell on the floor. I reached over and grabbed a napkin from the box on my night stand and handed it to her, chuckling.\n\n“Don’t talk with your mouth full, kiddo. Also, THAT, I don’t know. I’ve been trying to figure it out all week. I thought it had to have been a reptile, or a bird of some sort. I don’t know what else could make an Egg that size, but its design and patterns don’t match anything I’ve seen in the books at the library…And I have been checking different books every single day, looking for answers.” \n\nWhen I find something interesting, I almost become robotic… another “symptom,” I guess you could say, of my Autism and ADHD. Hyper Focus, extensive researching, robotic tendencies, and over-explaining everything I find even slightly cool. I know I do it, I just can’t particularly help it. \n\nMost people find it annoying, but like usual, Lily just looked at me and smiled her big bright smile, and said cheerily, “You’re so smart, Bubba. You’ll figure it out, and I’ll help you take care of it! Don’t worry. We can do it together.” \n\nShe nuzzled my arm for a second before she sprung up and started out of the room saying “I’ve got some homework! I’ll see you at dinner.” I smiled and waved as she left. \n\nI was tired. Strangely enough since I had brought the Egg home, it seemed like I had very restless sleep, and I couldnt remember dreaming at all. I thought it may have been a side effect of the concussion, but everywhere I looked online doesn’t say anything about completely losing your ability to dream… \n\nSo, I took a nap until dinner; my head hit the pillow, and I was out like a campfire that had 50 gallons of water dropped on it. \n\nAt around 7:00 pm, I think, since the sun was beginning to go down, I woke up to the sound of my mother yelling my name. When I opened my eyes I was completely awestruck. \n\nThe Egg looked completely different now. It was green and obviously pulsating with light, and it was leisurely wrapped up in these strange tendrils that almost looked like tentacles and/or vines.\n\nAt this rate, the Egg was about the size of a football, as well. It was… enchanting, to say the least; and I felt like the rest of the world got drowned out while I stared at it. \n\nSound disappeared, and I tunnel visioned in on the Egg. I’m not sure how long I stood there, but when I finally came back to full spatial awareness, the sun had completely gone down. \n\nThe glowing from the egg had all but subsided, and I was absolutely exhausted, and starving… The only way I can describe it is that it felt like somebody had just drained my life force. I stumbled down the stairs like a zombie, trying my best to be quiet, so I wouldn’t wake anyone up. Tiptoe-ing through the living room, and into the kitchen. I was so tired, it felt like I was drunk, or delusional, and I swear I kept seeing… something out of the corner of my eye. Some sort of strange shadow.\n\nI was barely there, as I made a sandwich and went back upstairs, as I was eating my sandwich. I sat on the edge of my bed and finished eating, zoning out, as sleep began to creep over me. The last thing I remember, I swear I could hear a small scratching sound, while everything went dark around me.\n\nThat’s the first time it happened. Saturday, April 27th, 3:00 AM. I woke up, sitting straight up, my heart pounding out of my chest. I was terrified, and I didn’t know why… but that’s when I felt it. The pain. Pulsating, radiating, hot… like something crawling under my skin, above my skull but under my scalp. Slowly my hands lifted to touch the area, and that’s when I felt it. These vine-like tendrils, made of plant matter or something like it, digging under the skin of my scalp. \n\nI tried to scream, but nothing came out. I tried to turn my head, and it erupted into fiery, blinding pain. I could feel them dig into my scalp, working their way along my skull towards my eyes. I could feel them crawling into the back of my head through my eye sockets, touching my brain, feeling, probing, absorbing… something. \n\nMy… energy? My… knowledge? I don’t know. But it was excruciating. I cried, silently, frozen in place, suffering… For what felt like years. In reality, it was probably about 3 hours or so, because the tendrils began to recede when the sun began to come up. The excruciating pain and exhaustion I felt, as the tendrils withdrew from my skull, I can only assume is what it feels like when you stick your head into a vat of scolding hot oil, after not sleeping for a year… yeah. It sucked.\n\nI collapsed back onto my pillow, and as the world went dark around me, yet again, the last thing I remember seeing was the vine-like tendrils receding… and wrapping themselves back around the Egg. And that noise again… the scratching noise... But louder this time… \n\n9:00am. My alarm. It sounded like a million nails on a chalkboard. I reached over and slapped the alarm until it quieted down. “Ugh.. Piece of Sh—“ I immediately sat up in my bed remembering the night before, my hands shooting you to the nape of my neck, where I felt… nothing? \n\nYeah I was just as confused as you are. I could have SWORN what I experienced was real; not some strange nightmare. I looked at my pillow, no blood. And the Egg was sitting in the exact position it had been when I went to sleep the first time. The only rational explanation was that I was dreaming. It wasn’t real. Just a really messed up figment of my imagination.\n\nI reached over and patted the Egg, and as I did, I felt it crumble, crunching into a million little pieces beneath my hand. My heart fell into my stomach and made a journey to my groin, and I looked over at the destroyed Egg. \n\nThere was nothing. No yolk, no animals, nothing; just dust and the remnants of the shattered shell. For a brief second I felt sorrow, anger, and confusion all at once, which was a little too much for me to handle. \n\nI immediately began to cry, and I sat alone in my room, curled up in a ball on the bed. I cried, and cried, and cried… and then Lily came in, I could see the urgency on her face as she addressed me, “big brother, what’s wrong?! Why are you crying? Wh—“ she stopped mid sentence as she saw the pieces of the egg shattered on the nightstand, and her face turned to one of sadness and empathy, and she hugged me tight, burying her face in my chest.\n\nNo matter how badly I felt, how broken I was, or how badly I was breaking down, Lily could always bring me back. And she always does. I felt her embrace become tighter and tighter and I could feel my soul being squished back into me, and my breathing beginning to calm down, and my heart beginning to slow. Like magic, her embrace was able to take away the pain.\n\n“I… I broke it, Lil Chipmunk…. I’m sorry. I break everything I touch… I wanted to help this poor animal, I wanted it to help us. I… I miss dad, Lil. I miss him so damn much…” I squeezed her back, and could hear her sniffling, and her little voice as she said “me too, bubs… but we will always have each other. You don’t need to worry about some silly Egg. It’s all gonna be okay.” \n\nWe cried together, and hung out for a while. Despite having slept all night and having that weird nightmare, I STILL felt entirely exhausted. Lily told me to lay back down and rest, and she would clean up my room for me, on the condition that when I get up, I’ll make French toast for her. I chuckled and agreed; she could always make me laugh. I laid back down, and fell asleep to the sounds of her cleaning up my room for me.\n\nWhen I woke up, the clock said noon, and so did the sun outside, shining directly on my face. It wasn’t pleasant, it felt like being hung-over. And I was absolutely hungry. I sat up and stretched, a little sore, a little dizzy, a lot nauseous; and immediately retched into the open garbage can next to my nightstand. \n\nBut it wasn’t vomit. No. No, it wasn’t vomit. Not bile, not partially digested food; no nothing like that. \n\nIt was…. Him. I could feel him, crawling up my throat, reaching for freedom, slithering, suffocating me; forcing his way out… and that’s when he made his debut.\n\nThis… thing. This gelatinous skull with eyes, and tentacles. A truly nightmarish creature; and I saw it, and tried to scream, and as I did it looked right at me, its eyes flashed red, and it was like I was frozen in time. I couldn’t move or scream or breathe. \n\nAll I could do was cry silently as this creature stared at me with its horrific eyes, slowly beginning to move, slipping around with its slimy tentacles. It was like it was staring into my soul, as it pushed itself up on its tentacles, climbing out of the trash can and slowly making its way up my body. \n\nIt stopped to rest on my shoulder, and I could hear the sickening squelching sounds, as its tentacles wrapped around my face, touching, feeling; investigating. Sweat and tears dropped off my face, as it got closer and closer to my ear, and I could feel its disgusting breath against my neck, as it began to speak…\n\n“Ahana ng ah'hri. Yog Say’z’goht.

Ymg' n'gha luln llllnahor, gof'n…” \n\nIt was weird, although I heard the creature speaking in the foreign, guttural language it was speaking, in my head I could hear the words in English; \n\n“Stay calm, human. We are Sau’z’goht. Your life force will sustain us, as your expiration grows nearer. So say the Unsleeping Ones.”\n\nThese words would echo over and over and over in my head, like a broken record, or an occult chant; as I felt this thing begin to claw its way back into my mind, into my skull. Again, the searing pain shot through my head and body.\n\nAnd that’s when I woke up. Covered in sweat, panicked, and achy. It was becoming harder and harder for me to understand when I was dreaming and when I wasn’t; everything just continued to feel wrong. I thought I wasn’t having dreams, but maybe EVERYTHING had been a dream, so far. \n\nI remember being confused and asking myself, “What is happening? Why is this happening? Am I really awake? How do I know if I’m awake?” That’s when I noticed it was dark in my room… I looked at the clock…\n\nIt said “3:00” but that couldn’t be possible, could it? I couldn’t have slept for 18 MORE hours, could I?… \n\nI took my phone out and it said “3:00 AM, Saturday, April 27th.”\n\nHow the hell… that's not possible. That’s when the fear truly set in. The hair raised on the back of my neck; Everything that just happened was a dream? \n\nI looked at the Egg, and it was perfectly intact. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I stood up and walked over to it, gently putting my hand on it. It was radiating its soft green light &amp; warmth, and felt calming to the touch. I guess I was going crazy, or just had the most wild set of dreams, I didn’t know, I didn’t care… I just knew I had to get rid of the Egg. \n\nAll of this weird stuff started happening when I brought it home, and nothing had been quite right, since then. I stopped dreaming, I lost chunks of time; and now, I was losing the ability to tell when I am sleeping or awake. The Egg needed to go. \n\nI picked it up and brought it outside to the garbage can, dropped it in, and shut it. Almost immediately I started feeling better. I went to the kitchen and grabbed a snack to eat, and made my way back up to my room, feeling better than I had all week, smiling, happy. I looked at the clock. \n\n“3:07” \n\nI guess I won, and it worked, since it was gone. I sighed heavily and laid back down, thinking about everything I had experienced. I didn’t know what was real and what was my apparently overactive imagination. Just that it was STILL Saturday morning. I shook my head and decided I’d deal with it in the morning, because I was ABSOLUTEY exhausted. I reached over, and set my alarm.\n\n9:00am. My alarm. It sounded like a million nails on a chalkboard. I reached over and slapped the alarm until it quieted down. “Ugh.. Piece of Sh—“ I immediately sat up in my bed remembering the night before, remembering… that I’ve done this already. But not just last night. The night before. And the night before. And the night before. Ever since I brought that egg home. Somehow, now that I had removed it, certain memories were flooding back.\n\nEvery night. 3:00AM. I’d sit up straight in bed, while the tendrils from the egg would slither and crawl their way over to me, making their way up my body, and clawing into my head. Tearing into my scalp and absorbing my energy?… my knowledge?… I still don’t know. Maybe both... But it doesn’t matter, the point is, that this Egg had been feeding on me for a week already\n\nBut it turns out, I hadn’t lost my ability to dream, whatever that thing was doing to me, it was also blacking it out of my memory. Probably to keep me complacent, and unafraid. Mom says complacency is the work of the Devil, after all. \n\nWait… the Devil… Mom… Could it be? Could mom maybe know about this creature, or thing, and maybe tell me more about it? I rushed out of my room, and went to go find her. \n\nI went down the stairs in my typical clunky, ape-like way, and looked around a bit for her. I ended up finding her in the kitchen, just about to make breakfast. \n\n“Hey, Mom. Good Morning.” \n\nThis silly system says I have to keep my posts under 40,000 words. So I’m going to upload this whole thing in 2 posts. Hopefully it actually works…",

        "text": "*\"Can you tell me a little bit more about the property?\"*\n\n\n\"Yeah, sure. It was built in the late 1870's, but most of the original structure and exterior has been replaced and updated throughout the years. You know how it is, the craftsmanship of old doesn't quite live up to today's styles and safety regulations\".\n\n\n*\"I know exactly what you mean, but from what you say, it is quite an old house. Surely that means there must be a bit of history within the house. A few stories surrounding it?\"*\n\n\n\"I've heard a number of local legends that involve the house. A neighbour once told me that it was used as a distillery during the prohibition era. I've heard that JFK once took a photo in front of the place, but I've never seen the photographic evidence to back that story up.\n\n\nOh, and someone once claimed that, for a whole summer, some sort of religious cult squatted inside the house while it was vacant. They claimed that the members left behind strange markings and small burn marks along the walls. What were they called again? The Acquaintance's of Fire, or the Friends of Flame. Something like that. That's what was told to me, but I don't even know if it's true.\n\n\nThe only history that I am certain of, is that a young couple with a small child lived here before us, and a little old lady inhabited the house before them\".\n\n\n*\"Well, if true, that certainly is a rich history. Old houses like yours usually come with a few local legends attached. I think that is sometimes a good selling point. \n\n\nI'm just looking through your file here, and I see here that you have purchased our Golden Paranormal Insurance Policy, with protection against hauntings, poltergeists, possessions and death from supernatural occurrences?\".*\n\n\n\"That's correct\".\n\n\n*\"I can certainly see why you have chosen our top insurance package. Due to the age and possible history of the house, you definitely want the best coverage against any sort of ghostly activity. Especially if some sort of cult has been operating within your home\".*\n\n\n\"Actually, that's something I've been meaning to ask about. I'm hesitant to hear the answer though. If the claims about the cult are true, that won't affect my claim, will it? Just cause I saw that if the ghost or entity was summoned, then I won't be covered?\".\n\n\n*\"No, no, you will still be eligible for payment. That clause only applies if you summoned the entity yourself\".*\n\n\n\"Oh good. That's a relief\".\n\n\n*\"But anyway, I really must ask you about your claim. I see that you have applied for $2780 in property damage and another $10,450 compensation for the emotional and physical distress the haunting has caused you and your family. Does that all sound familiar, Mr. Walker\"?*\n\n\n\"Yes, that's right\".\n\n\n*\"Oh good. Well, as I'm sure you understand, I must do my due diligence and ask a few questions about the haunting. This will allow your claim to progress, but you still may be subjected to an investigator to attend your property. Their job will then be to determine that your supernatural activity is genuine, and that the amount of money you are claiming is proportionate to the damage inflicted. Does this all make sense to you\"?*\n\n\n\"Yes, that makes sense. I do hope you are able to process my claim quickly though. My family and I have been through quite the ordeal and we really don't need this dragging on\".\n\n\n*\"Well Sir, if you talk me through the strange occurrences you've experienced, then we can get the insurance ball rolling. You can start by telling me how the haunting began\".*\n\n\n\"The first occurrence happened just a little over a month ago. It started small, in fact I barely noticed it. It was a cold night and so I was sitting in front of the fireplace, poking at the embers after the flames had died out.  The wife and kids were in bed and I was the last one left up, making sure the fire was well and truly extinguished before turning in for the night. This meant that I was the only one that saw it. \n\n\nIn the ashes, just for a moment, I saw two eyes staring back at me. It's hard to describe exactly, but it looked as if two eyeballs appeared within the cluster of coal. They appeared as if they were still on fire. Like the eye's themselves were burning. \n\n\nThey only appeared for a matter of moments before the embers glowed normally again. I shouldn't have, but I just dismissed it as my tired mind seeing things that weren't actually there\".\n\n\n*\"That sounds right. Most claims I look at all  start small or rather inconspicuous and most people write them off as nothing more than their mind playing tricks on them, but they all get drastically worse. So, let me guess, things escalated rapidly after that?\"*\n\n\n\"Yes. Unfortunately, they did. The next thing that happened involved our family photos. One thing our family prides itself on is being able to take a good picture, and so we have plenty of family portraits hung up around the house. \n\n\nThat being said, I don't know how often they are actually looked at by anyone, so I don't know exactly how long they had been damaged before I saw what had happened to them.  What I do know though, is that it was about a week after the fireplace incident that I noticed the first photograph. \n\n\nAlong the mantle, just above the fireplace, there has always been a row of five different family photos taken at different outings. The photo in question was  taken during a family trip to the zoo. In front of the monkey enclosure actually, but nevermind. \n\n\nThe point is, every single one of our eyes had been burned out of the picture. Small  holes, the size of a cigarette burns, were present where our eyes should've been. On every single one of us. My three kids. My wife. And me. All of us had had our eyes burnt out.\n\n\nI was shocked when I first saw it, and thought that that's what it was. Cigarette burns. My wife and I aren't smokers and so my immediate thought was that my eldest daughter had secretly taken up the bad habit. \n\n\nAt first I was angry, but then logic took over. Even if she was smoking, that still didn't explain why she would burn out our eyes. It was  when I looked at the other photos on the mantle that I realised this definitely wasn't caused by her. \n\n\nIn each of those photos. The same. In fact  I quickly discovered that our eyes had been reduced to small burn holes in every photo in the house\".\n\n\n\"*Hmm burn marks in the photos. I think I have heard that before. I have to ask though, was this the extent of the property damage or has there been more\"?*\n\n\n\"There's more. In the following days, the kids found small burn marks across the walls. They were just sporadically scattered across the house. They were always circular, and about the size of a ping pong ball. They always came in two as well. Two small holes burnt into the wall, right next to each other. I knew this definitely wasn't caused by one of the kids lighting up a cigarette.\n\n\nI think in the few days between discovering the burn and when we all saw him, we must've found a dozen or so of these strange burns\". \n\n\n*\"What do you mean, 'when we all saw him'\"?*\n\n\n\"I mean what I said. We all saw him. The man with fire in his eyes\".\n\n\n*\"Hmm, interesting. Do go on\".*\n\n\n\"We were all sitting around the kitchen table, saying grace before eating, when I felt a sharp pain in my hand. I looked down and saw that my flesh was starting to burn. I could see the skin starting to blister and the smell of cooking meat started to fill the air. \n\n\nI screamed and jumped up out of my seat, to the shock of everyone else sitting at the table. I was staring down at my searing flesh, both in pain and in terror. It was when Maggie screamed, that my mind focussed back on where I was. I looked over at my eldest, who was pale white and pointing towards something within the kitchen.\n\n\nAt the other end of the table, standing just behind my wife, was a man who was staring straight towards me. Well, towards my hand. We never made eye contact. His eyes were different from any I had seen before. They weren't the normal brown or blue. His were a bright orange. And they were flickering. Almost like a small flame had been lit inside his iris. When I looked at his eyes, I think I saw Hell reflected back at me.\"\n\n\n\"*A man with flames in his eyes?*\"\n\n\n\"Yes. Ask my wife. Even ask my children for God's sake. They all saw the same thing. The man was burning eyes\".\n\n\n*\"Okay, Sir. This is what is going to happen now. If you wish to take this claim further, one of our investigators will be sent to your home. They will look for evidence of your claims and it will be up to their discretion whether or not the compensation will be paid out to you. Do you understand?\"*\n\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\n-End of Recording-\n\n\nReport for Paranormal Insurance - Case 708\n\n\nI have listened to the recording of the initial phone call regarding Case 708. I have familiarised myself with what has occurred and the amount of compensation Mr. Walker has requested. \n\n\nA thorough investigation will now be undertaken and documented below. My initial thoughts, however, are that this case will be revealed to be a hoax.\n\n\nI arrived at the Walker's residence at 10:34 on Saturday morning. I hopped out of my car, grabbed my suitcase off the passenger seat, and walked up to the house.\n\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the beauty and sheer size of the property. I had to crane my neck almost fully back just to see the tip of the house's pointed roof. \n\n\nThe outside walls were comprised of timber panelling and the roof was made from light grey tiles. Four pillars acted as a support for a large verandah that stuck out the front of the house. \n\n\nI wouldn't quite describe the property as awe-inspiring, but I would say that it looked expensive. From first glance, there was no visible property damage on the outside, which was consistent with what had previously been described. All the damage was inside the house. \n\n\nA high iron gate ran around the perimeter of the house, protecting it from any outside threats. The irony that the threat they were facing was from within the house, and not out of it, was not lost on me. \n\n\nThe biggest outside threat they currently faced was an Insurance Investigator about to try and pick holes in their claims and reveal it all to be fake.\n\n\nThe automatic gate began to slide open, as the family must have seen my arrival.\n\n\nIt is usually at this point that I am greeted by a disgruntled person, presumably annoyed that their claim is being thoroughly investigated before any sort of payment is given to them.\n\n\nUsually, it is because they have experienced something terrifying, and the last thing they want to do is recount that experience to someone like me. \n\n\nBut, occasionally they are frustrated because they know it's only a matter of time before I reveal their 'haunting' to be nothing more than an attempt at fraud. \n\n\nI anticipated a certain degree of animosity from Mr. Walker and his family, due to the fact that I believed they were in the middle of a hoax.\n\n\nOnce the gate had finished sliding open, I stepped forward onto the cobbled path that led up to the entrance of the house. \n\n\nWaiting for me was a middle aged man with short brown hair. He looked fairly ordinary and was dressed casually in pants and a shirt. The only thing that stood out about this man was the pair of dark sunglasses that he wore across his face. They were unusual because it was dark and gloomy outside, with no sunshine anywhere to be seen. \n\n\nHe greeted me with a slight nod and a monotone \"morning\". I outstretched my hand to greet him in a more professional manner. He too reached his hand outwards and clasped mine. I did want to properly meet this man, but I do confess that the handshake also had an ulterior motive. \n\n\nAs he clasped my hand, I quickly glanced down and took a peak at the back of his hand. Two small burn marks were present on his flesh. They were still blistering and so I decided that they were still relatively fresh.\n\n\nI was almost surprised to see the charred skin. Either, this man's claims were indeed true, or he was very committed to the hoax. Some people go to desperate lengths for money. \n\n\nNow, if you have listened to the recording of the initial phone call, you may have noticed a slight change in the operator's voice as soon as the 'Flame-eyed Man' was mentioned. And, during this report, I have claimed multiple times that this will turn out to be a hoax. \n\n\nBut, if you are unfamiliar with the most famous, and most lucrative of all Paranormal Insurance cases, you may be unaware as to why this case has already been written off as fraud. \n\n\nSo, to the uninformed, I will quickly fill you in as to why this case reeks of lies and money grabbing.\n\n\nIt was an old case, maybe five years ago now, that involved similar elements to what I am now investigating. A family. Burnt photos. Small burn marks on the walls. And, of course, visions of The Flame-Eyed Man.\n\n\nThe man, a Mr. Cole Ames, filed the insurance claim hoping for compensation for property and personal damages. Similar to the Walker claim. Mr. Ames claimed that him and his friends did something dumb in their younger years. Something that meant he was now being haunted by this particular entity.\n\n\nBut, at the time, there was no concrete evidence that pointed to any of it being real, so the case was also deemed a hoax, and no money was paid out to the man who filed the claim. It was only after his death that a large sum was given to his grieving family. \n\n\nThe case must have gained traction in some local press, and soon enough, a number of people were familiar with it. This meant that a number of people started faking hauntings and trying to claim that they were also victims of the Flame-Eyed Man. I thought this was such a case. \n\n\nSo, now everyone is up to speed, I will finish my recount of what happened with the Walker family.\n\n\nI finished shaking Mr. Walker's hand, and began to introduce myself. I explained who I was, what my job was and that I would need access to the house in order to assess his claims. He politely nodded, but I'm pretty sure he already knew exactly who I was. \n\n\nHe introduced himself as Max, and then opened the door for me, granting me entry to his fabulous home.\n\n\nThe doorway led into a long hallway with high ceilings. Green floral wallpaper was spread across its walls, fitting in with the house's rustic aesthetic. It was so long that it almost looked more like a tunnel than a hallway. \n\n\nAs I stepped through the doorway, the first thing I noticed was the distinct smell of burnt paper and wood. It was only faint, but was just enough for my nose to register it.\n\n\n\"You can smell it already, can't you? The burning.\"\n\n\n\"It does smell like something has been on fire in here\".\n\n\n\"Take a look over there. There's the cause of it\".\n\n\nMax lifted one hand and pointed a finger towards the wall a bit further down the hallway. I stepped towards it and saw what it was that he was pointing to. \n\n\nTwo small burn marks were scorched into the wallpaper on the wall. \n\n\nI studied the marks, which had clearly been the result of a small fire. Two black marks situated only an inch or two apart from each other. They looked like someone had used the wall to put out their cigar.\n\n\nIt was entirely possible that this is exactly what happened. That one of the family member's had burnt them into the wooden wall themselves, but I couldn't prove that this was the case. But, they couldn't prove it wasn't. \n\n\nI turned back around to look at Max again. Even though he still wore his sunglasses in the dimly lit corridor, I could somehow tell that he had a defeated look in his eyes. \n\n\n\"You'll find another four further down. And three more in the kitchen. And God knows how many more in the bedrooms\".\n\n\nMr. Walker's voice was quieter now. His tone matched the defeated look I thought his eyes must've been conveying. Even though he sounded upset, I still had a job to do and so continued on with my investigation.\n\n\n\"If possible, I would like to speak with the entire family. It helps me gain a better understanding of what exactly happened here, you know. Let's me see the whole picture\", I said to him in a polite manner.\n\n\n\"Yeah sure. I can't imagine you will be here long though. You've already seen the burn marks. And soon you will see the true damage of this entity and then you will be on your way\", he replied, now sounding frustrated. Annoyed that I was even here snooping around. \n\n\nHe then called out for his kids to come downstairs to the kitchen, which echoed through the house's large front room. \n\n\nHe then gestured for me to follow him, and so I tailed behind him, studying the walls as I walked along the hallway.\n\n\n\"There's another one.\"\n\n\nHe didn't stop walking as he spoke, instead just pointed to another pair of burn marks in the wall. \n\n\nI looked and saw they were identical to the first lot of marks I'd seen. \n\n\nAs I looked past the burnt spots on the wall, I noticed a line of three photographs, hung up in row along the wall. \n\n\nOne was taken at the beach. Another at a theme park, and one from a professional photoshoot.\n\n\nThe photos all had two things in common. Each one was of all five members of the family, smiling and enjoying each other's company. \n\n\nThe other similarity was the small holes that were through each family member's eyes. The paper was charred around the circumference of the holes, indicating that they had been burnt out. The glass in each frame was still perfectly intact.\n\n\n\"It's the same with every photo in the house\", Max said from in front of me. \n\n\n\"I'm sure it is.\", I responded. \n\n\nMax walked to the end of the hallway and through a large door. I followed and found myself entering the kitchen, which was renovated and modern.\n\n\nAt the other side of the room, a long, black table was situated. Three girls, two around the age of ten and the eldest, who looked to be in her mid-teens. There was also a woman in her forties sitting around the table. Obviously, this was the family.\n\n\nI introduced myself and then placed my suitcase onto the long table. I opened it up and pulled out a small tape recorder.\n\n\n\"Is everyone okay if I ask a few questions and record your answers on here?\"\n\n\nThey all nodded, almost reluctantly, and then I began to ask the questions that needed answers. \n\n\n\"Is anyone here an avid user of cigarettes or cigars?\"\n\n\nThe three young girls shook their heads, and Max shot a glare in my direction. His wife did the same.\n\n\n\"For the recording, that was a definite no\".\n\n\nI continued. \n\n\n\"Has anyone performed any sort of ritual? Tried anything supernatural or strange? Ouija boards. Seances. That sort of thing?\"\n\n\nThe two parents looked towards their children, who all shook their heads. Then, the edlest Maggie, spoke. \n\n\n \"No, of course we haven't. In a house as old as this, it would be crazy for us to get involved in anything like that\".\n\n\n\"I'm sorry if my question offended you in any way, but these are the questions I need to ask. Now, is it okay if I proceed with the next question?\n\n\nOther than what has already been described. The burn marks on the walls. The holes in the photos. And the sighting of The Flame Eyed Man, have you seen anything unusual? Any other unexplainable occurrences?\"\n\n\nEveryone in the family let out a murmured 'no'. Well, almost everything. The middle child didn't speak. Instead, she just kept staring forwards. \n\n\n\"So, we are sure that nothing else out of the ordinary has occurred?\"\n\n\nAs I spoke, I looked directly at the middle daughter, and tried to gauge her reaction. She continued to look straight ahead. \n\n\n\"Because, if anyone knows anything more, now would be the time to share what it is they know\".\n\n\nShe finally spoke up.\n\n\n\"I found… I found something. In my room.\"\n\n\nHer voice was faint and nervous. \n\n\n\"What did you find, Isabella?\", Max asked her, concern definitely present in his voice.\n\n\n\"I saw something on the wall. Behind the wallpaper. When the first burn happened on my wall, I saw something. So, I peeled some more of the wallpaper away, and I saw more of it\".\n\n\nHer voice still sounded apprehensive, and it was clear that this was the first time she had told anyone this. \n\n\n\"What did you see, Darling?\", Max asked again.\n\n\n\"I'll show you\".\n\n\nWe all stood up from the table and followed the small girl out of the room. She led the group of us along the hallway, eyeless photographs staring at us as we walked past.\n\n\nWe followed Isabella up the flight of wooden stairs and to, what was presumably, her bedroom. She opened her door and invited us in.\n\n\nThe room was a typical young girls bedroom. Pink wallpaper. Pink and white striped bed covers. Small dollhouse in the corner of the room. \n\n\nThe only thing out of the ordinary for a young girl to have in her room were five pairs of circular burn marks dispersed across the wall. I also spied another set scorched into the white carpet.\n\n\nIsabella didn't say a word, instead just walked over to the dollhouse in the corner and pushed it slightly to the right. This revealed another burn in the wall, but what the dollhouse was truly covering up, was wallpaper that had been peeled away. \n\n\nThe wallpaper was hiding something of its own, but since Isabella had removed some of it, its secrets had been revealed.\n\n\nThere were more burns in the bare wooden wall behind. But, they weren't the usual round marks. Instead, charcoal black words were seared into the wood. \n\n\nTHE FRIENDS OF THE FLAME CALL OUT YOUR NAME. SHOW US WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN.\n\n\nUnderneath the thick, burnt in letters were smaller words burnt into the wall. This time there were names.\n\n\nSarah Martin\n\nSonya Polski\n\nCole Ames\n\nDaniel Ember\n\n\n \"I have never seen this before\", Max said to me as we all looked at it in horror, \"But I have heard of the 'Friends of the Flame' before\".\n\n\n\"And I've heard of Cole Ames\", I replied, still shocked by what had been uncovered.\n\n\nThis was the first piece of evidence that I could actually use to grant this family their money. The first sign that this entire case was not a hoax. But, that was not a good thing. Not for the family. \n\n\nOnly once has a claim about the Flame Eyed Man ended up with money being paid out. That claim, as I said before, was paid out to Cole Ames family and not to him directly. \n\n\nThat's because that case had ended in his death. Cole was found, alone in his home with both eyes clawed out and then the sockets burnt. Meaning they had been burnt after his eyes had been removed. \n\n\nIt was a grisly end, and one that I didn't wish upon this family. But, one that I thought may be inevitable. But, I now had proof that their haunting could actually be genuine. Something that could mean they would get their money, bringing them some shred of happiness before tragedy could fall upon them. \n\n\n\"Do you mind if I take a photo of the wall? It will greatly increase your chances of receiving a payout \", I asked the family.\n\n\nMax didn't respond, but I saw him staring at the wall with his sunglasses still firmly on his face. He was mouthing the words 'Show us what you have seen'. Instead, his wife looked over to me and nodded.\n\n\nI once again reached into my briefcase and pulled out a small polaroid camera. I pointed it at the peeled away wallpaper and the words underneath and took the photo.\n\n\nA quick flash of light shot out the camera, and then a whirring sound could be heard. Then, the camera started to spit out the small polaroid print. I pulled it out and shook it and colour started to appear on the blank white square of paper. \n\n\nThen, an idea struck me. I could possibly gain one more piece of undeniable evidence that would put the approved stamp onto this case. \n\n\n\"Is it okay if I take a family photo of you all? It could be important\".\n\n\n\"What for?\", Max asked.\n\n\n\"Just trust me\".\n\n\nThe entire family looked doubtful that a family portrait would help proceedings, but they awkwardly huddled together in the centre of the room. None of them could muster a smile, but instead could only manage a frightful look in their eyes. \n\n\nI took the photo.\n\n\nThe camera let out another flash. I noticed Max recoil slightly as the bright light shot out and reflected off his dark sunglasses. \n\n\nThen, a slight whirring sound could be heard as the polaroid began to print. The blank photo came out of the camera, but there was something different about this polaroid film. There were ten small holes scattered across the small print-out.\n\n\nThe picture of the family started to form, the colour seeping out of the blank paper. I anticipated that this could happen, but I didn't expect it to happen so quickly. Each family member's face lined up perfectly with the holes that were already in the photograph. Right across their eyes. \n\n\nThis was all the evidence that I needed to prove that this haunting was legitimate. The writing on the wall and now the burnt eyes on a photo I had only just taken.\n\n\n\"Well, I can verify that your haunting is legitimate and you will be receiving the money that you have asked for\".\n\n\nMax's weary and sullen face changed. Just for a moment, as I saw the slightest hint of a smile. \n\n\n\"I just need to go over the damage in the house, just to verify that it is proportionate to the amount you claimed for, which I think it will be\".\n\n\nI then spent the next while evaluating the damage that the Flame-Eyed Man had caused around the house. Everything seemed to be correct, and the Walker family would be receiving the correct amount of money.\n\n\nOnce I was done, I thanked the kids for their time, and thanked Isabella for showing us all what she had discovered. \n\n\nMax then shook my hand, and spoke.\n\n\n\"Thank you for your time. Let me walk you out\".\n\n\nI followed him through the hallway once again, and out the front door. As we stepped out onto the verandah, Max stopped and turned around to face me. \n\n\n\"I haven't quite told you everything. Like Isabella hadn't.\", he said quite seriously, \"That's because I haven't even told my wife and kids everything\". \n\n\nI stared at him confused, waiting for him to fill me in on what he had left out before. He continued. \n\n\n\"I have seen the man with flame in his eyes again. Since that time at dinner. I know I told the guy on the phone I had only seen him the once. But, I've seen him three more times in fact\", he said as he unbuttoned the collar of his shirt. \n\n\nHe parted his shirt and revealed more burns on his flesh. Two more pairs of circular blisters were present across his chest and on his neck. He then reached up and slid the sunglasses off his face, revealing charred flesh around his eyes. His eyes were bloodshot, and quite clearly burnt. \n\n\n\"I saw him early this morning. This time, we made eye contact.\", he said, fear present in his voice. \n\n\nHe continued, \"He showed me things. As he looked into my eyes, burning me, he showed me. \n\n\nHe showed me the fiery pits. The blood soaked ground. I felt the intense heat. I even heard the screams. That's all I could hear. He showed me. He showed me Hell\". \n\n\nHe paused for a second to suppress his emotion with a large gulp.\n\n\n\"I could feel the flames engulfing my entire body. I was burning. Burning but not dying. I could feel myself being scorched, but my body didn't show any sign of injury.\n\n\nStrange creatures, maybe demons or possibly other damned souls, were gathered around my body, laughing and dancing as I burned. They all looked burnt and withered, like they had endured the flames for an eternity, but still hadn't perished in them.\n\n\n He wasn't giving me a glimpse into what Hell was like. No, it was different than that. He was showing me what was waiting for me. He was showing me my future.\n\n\n\"He made me look at it. Experience it. I couldn't bear it. I just wanted to rip my eyes out to make the visions stop. I actually wished he would burn my eyes out so that I wouldn't have to see it anymore\", he said before stopping.\n\nIt was at this moment that, for the first time in my career, I felt genuine fear. The haunting was real and I now had a sense of urgency to get out of the house. My heart was racing at the mere thought that the Flame Eyed Man was lurking within the corridors of the property. \n\nI felt the sweat build up along my brow and the hairs on my arms stand up straight. I even had the sense that someone was staring directly at me from behind. Which they could've been.\n\nI needed to get off the premises as soon as I could.\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell him about Cole Ames, and how he met his end. Maybe Max already knew about him, but even if he didn't, I think he had already figured out how this haunting was going to end. \n\n\nI think he just wanted some money, just something nice before the inevitable occured. So, I have also attached the polaroid photos to this report and conclude, in my professional opinion, that this is a genuine case of a family haunted by an evil entity. \n\n\nMy recommendation is that the money be paid out in full to the family. And should be done hastily. Before it's too late.",

        "text": "I have always believed in human decency. I have always believed that if a normal person is faced with the decision to be kind or cruel they would choose the better option. When people spoke about human nature as anything other than inherently altruistic, I thought that they were just hiding behind cynicism to ensure they wouldn’t get hurt.\n\nI have always believed in human decency, but then I started a YouTube channel.\n\nThe channel wasn’t meant to kickstart an extravagant media career, hell, it wasn’t even meant to be a fun hobby. I just needed a place to easily share videos with extended family. The idea of a stranger stumbling into snapshots of my life never really occurred to me.\n\nBut they did. They descended into my life like starving vultures and made me doubt any shred of belief I ever had in human decency.\n\nI posted up the first video about two years ago. It was a quick thirty-second clip from my mother-in-law’s birthday party. A couple months prior her husband of fifty years had passed and my wife wanted to make sure that her mother wouldn’t end up spending her birthday alone. The video was simple but sweet; half a dozen people gathered around an old lady singing happy birthday as she struggled to blow out the candles.\n\nThere were three comments.\n\nThe first, came from my wife’s sister who was out in Europe on a business trip:\n\n**BClarke** “Sorry I couldn’t make it! Hope you’re saving some cake for me! Happy birthday mom!”\n\nThe second, from my brother, who my wife wasn’t keen on inviting to family gatherings:\n\n**RayDavid** “Doesn’t look a day over 70! Stay classy Mrs. Clarke!”\n\nAnd the third, from an account that could only be identified by its blank silhouette profile picture and nondescript name:\n\n**AngryGorilla78** “You people are sick. Look at that woman. She doesn’t want to be there. She doesn’t want to be alive anymore. I bet you she cries every night, torn between the pain of her frail body and the agony of living without the love of her life. Just let her die already.”\n\nFor a second I wondered whether the comment wasn’t just another one of my brother’s strange jokes, but it was far too vile for even him to type out. I briefly considered responding but I didn’t let my anger get the better of me. I simply deleted the comment and moved on with my life.\n\nI did my best to push the internet stranger’s words out of my head and, for the most part, I did. Whenever we went to visit the old lonely woman in her nursing home, however, AngryGorilla’s assessment of my mother-in-law’s will to live kept echoing through my skull. When we finally laid her to rest last winter the words echoed once more, but there was a finality to them. She was gone. Anything that this YouTube commenter had to say about her was drowned out by a barrage of heartfelt eulogies. I thought that I wouldn’t have to worry about the words of another internet stranger ever again.\n\nI have a daughter. She’s in elementary school. She plays the piano. I have, on multiple occasions, suggested to my wife that our daughter does not like playing the piano but she would hear none of it. My wife’s parents never encouraged her to learn an instrument and she regretted it all her life. She wasn’t going to let our daughter miss out on music as well. So, every Thursday afternoon, for a year and a half, my daughter would get marched into after school piano practice.\n\nA couple months ago she had a recital. Her final one. On the car ride back home our daughter made it very clear that she hated playing the piano. My wife tried convincing her otherwise but I put my foot down and said that if the kid didn’t want to learn an instrument she wouldn’t need to learn an instrument. My daughter, the tiny diplomat, suggested that she could learn an instrument that wasn’t stupid, like, say, a saxophone.\n\nAt the recital our daughter performed a rendition of Claire De Lune which my wife caught on camera. The moment we got home my wife insisted I post the recording on YouTube so the rest of the family could see the performance. I got our daughter’s permission to post the video and promised to keep it unlisted so only our friends could see it.\n\nBy the time we sat down for dinner the video had already amassed a pile of comments from the family Facebook chat. Possibly in the hopes of changing our daughter’s mind in regards to quitting piano lessons, my wife read each and every single comment out loud over dinner, including the one from my brother’s fiancé that suggested our daughter play the song at their wedding.\n\nWhen my wife reached the username BashfulVulture44, however, she went quiet. She read the comment to herself under her breath and, when she finished, immediately pulled me out of the dining room. \n\nWhoever BashfulVulture44 was, they were sick. \n\nShe wanted me to delete the comment immediately.\n\nUpon reading the bile myself I raced to the computer and deleted the message. I was beyond furious and trying to figure out who from the family chat would have gone through such pains to tear my daughter down, but I quickly realized BashfulVulture44 wasn’t alone.\n\nThe comment section was full of his ilk. Dozens of internet strangers were flooding the comment section with cruel comments about my daughter, my wife, me and everyone else in the auditorium. I rushed through the comment section deleting every unfamiliar account I could see, yet whenever I refreshed the page there was another barrage of vitriol to sort through. I was so focused on deleting the individual comments that I didn’t notice the replies.\n\nBeneath each kind comment from the family there were replies. The internet strangers replied to my cousins and parents and in-laws with surgical cruelty. The reply chains were littered with horrible accusations and maddening vulgarity that would make one’s heart hurt, but the worst fury was reserved for the top comment.\n\n**JaneBest87** “What a beautiful piece! Really hope you can play it at mine and Ray’s wedding!”\n\nThe first reply had over 200 likes.\n\n**VoluminousSerpent88** “Is Ray’s secretary coming to the wedding Jane? Probably not. Probably not, but everyone knows. The whole office knows and so does the family. They avoid looking in your eyes for a reason Jane. They know about the secretary and they know Ray’s wives never outlast the honeymoon. How does it feel being a band-aid on a broken man’s scuffed cock?”\n\nRight beneath that reply was my brother, denying the affair and threatening to physically fight whoever wrote the comment. Beneath his reply there was a menagerie of rabid animals making further assertions about Ray’s character and behavior. They spoke at length about his presumed affair. They listed dates and times and locations. The comments were detailed enough to suggest there was an air of truth about them.\n\nI stopped deleting individual comments. \n\nI deleted the video and then the entire channel. \n\nI wiped any trace of my name off YouTube but the damage was done. I don’t know which members of the family had read the comments, but Ray’s fiancé did. \n\nThat made all the difference.\n\nOver the next couple of weeks Ray’s wedding plans fell apart. The drama unraveled itself through long phone calls and late night visits all set to the squealing of an inexperienced saxophone player. When the dust finally settled, we were all worse for it. The sea of faceless strangers had unearthed family secrets that made any possibility of a reunion a hellish affair.\n\nI spent a lot of time thinking about the channel. I tried comprehending what had actually happened. How that single link in a family chat had brought so many strangers into our midst and how those strangers knew so much about us. I spent many a night trying to make sense of it all, but I resigned from the hopeless task.\n\nI moved on with my life, intent on forgetting about the masses of the internet and rebuilding the few bridges that still stood. As my brother’s planned wedding date got closer his condition went from bad to worse. Ray had some problems with the drink when we were growing up, but in his adult life he had developed the ability to keep a lid on it. Jane breaking off the engagement robbed him of that ability.\n\nI knew I couldn’t get Ray to stop drinking, he was far too hard-headed for that. So, to make sure he wouldn’t get into a car wreck and to have some semblance of control about how much he drank — I would invite him over to our house. While my wife and daughter would sleep upstairs Ray and I would kick back on the porch with a bottle of whiskey and try to make sense of the world.\n\nIt was the night after his wedding was meant to take place, the night when he got drunker and angrier than he ever did before, that I got the e-mail. I was pretty sauced myself and was chugging a glass of water in the kitchen to lessen the looming hangover when my phone dinged. \n\nAn e-mail from YouTube. \n\nThey were congratulating me on my first 100,000 subscribers.\n\nThe shift from confusion to bone chilling terror happened the moment I clicked on the link attached to the e-mail. My channel was back and bigger than ever. The views of the two videos I had deleted were well in the hundreds of thousands, but there was a third video which I had not posted. \n\nIt was titled ‘Ray and Jane’s wedding.’ \n\nThe video was just a couple views shy of a million.\n\nBy the time I was back on the porch I had ordered my brother an Uber back home. I was far too panicked to explain my sudden need for his departure and my brother was far too drunk to question it. He put on his coat, had half a cigarette and then rode off into the night with a stranger my smartphone found him.\n\nHe left me alone. \n\nHe left me alone with my phone.\n\nImmediately, I recognized the location of the video. I had seen the pictures of the old manor where Jane had planned the wedding at just about every family gathering leading up to Christmas. The open face sandwiches, the wedding cake, the tacky table cloths and gold-rimmed wine glasses — the whole wedding was exactly as Jane had planned.\n\nExcept for the guests.\n\nThe family was there. Ray’s blood, Jane’s blood, smatterings of work friends — all the guests were there. They were there but they all looked old and exhausted and miserable. The whole guest-list for the wedding was there and they were all staring straight into the camera. \n\nThe video was taking place during the newlywed’s first dance but even they looked into the lens in abject despair. Both Jane and Ray were shadows of their former selves, yet they still held their shivering bodies against each other in a poor pantomime of a romantic dance.\n\nThey danced to a broken rendition of Claire De Lune. Behind the piano that was far too big for her, wearing the same dress she wore for her recital back in the happier days, was my daughter. She was weeping. She was playing the instrument she hated so much and weeping and staring into the camera.\n\nThe video refused to disappear. No matter how many times I removed it or deleted the whole channel — the video wouldn’t disappear. The video didn’t disappear and the comment section kept overflowing with ugly, vile assertions about me, my family and everyone I had ever cared for.\n\nTo think that there were people out there, hundreds of thousands of people, that were willing to commit such atrocious thoughts to public discourse made me lose all faith in human decency. What worries me so much more, however, what makes my fingers quiver even as I write these words, was the top rated comment on the wedding video.\n\nSix thousand likes and climbing.\n\n**RabidCrow69**: “Great content!

        "text": "A bunch of drunk people near an abandoned place known for all the mysteries surrounding it, what could go wrong?\n\nMy friends and I were across the street from the abandoned terrain known for all the missing people who never came back after entering through those spiky gates, and what else would we be there for other than going inside?\n\nAs the last of us jumped from the top of that gate, we finally managed to get a good look at what awaited us.\n\nAll the dead plants in the garden, all the broken windows, all the graffities that seemed to be the only form of color coming through this place disconnected from reality for who knows how long\n\nThat should have been all that was needed to make anyone get back right from where they came from. But not us, apparently...\n\nAs we creeped closer to the main entrance, it seemed as if the sounds we could before hear coming from all the streets nearby, slowly got lower and lower, coming to a complete stop as soon as someone grabbed the doorknob.\n\nAfter we opened the door, with all our flashlights, we finally got a look inside that strange building, and to our surprise, the house was brand new from the inside. Altho it seemed as if it had never left the 18th century, it was surprisingly pleasant.\n\nThat gave us all the courage that we needed to keep on pressing forward, uncovering everything that house had to offer.\n\nWe kept on going from what seemed hours, door after door, corridor after corridor, but after a while we were not even concerned any more by the size of this house, that seemed honestly infinite, we were starting to get concerned with the changing scenario, and the weird atmosphere that somehow after every turn managed to get even more horrifying\n\nwe went from an 18th century house, to what seemed more of a church, and then to some kind of fabric, and now we could see ourselves walking through what seems like a tunnel. Why a tunnel, you may ask. That is because we have not seen anything new for a while now. Just the concave brick walls with no walls for what seems like forever.\n\nSlowly, our flashlights died, one by one, leaving us in complete darkness. We all gathered around our smoker friend, that now had the only source of light in his hand, his lighter. We were in discussion what to do. Some of us wanted to try going back, \"but wait, haven't we already turned before?\" \"What? We were walking in a straight line, when would we have turned dumbass?\" \"No, he is right, I remember that at some point we did turn around because we were getting tired\", and just like that a discussion broke out on what direction we had actually headed up to this point.\n\nUnfortunately for us, that discussion didn't last long, because we only now noticed the dry bloody handprints on the wall.\n\nPanic took over, nobody was able to discuss anything anymore.\n\nWe picked a direction and started running, but no matter how long we ran for, nothing changed.\n\nSlowly, the panic was being substituted by the sense of dread, and after a while there was no hope anymore. \"Give up dude, it's useless, we are stuck here. There is no escape\" said one of our friends, as he sat on the ground, \"if you guys want, you can go without me, but I'm not wasting my time walking forever.\". \"I can't take anymore, just leave me here, I don't want to walk anymore\" said another one of our friends after a while, as she sat on the ground with a desolated face.\n\nSlowly, each one of that group had decided to be left behind, there was no end in sight, and no reason to have any sort of hope.\n\nMy last friend told me, \"this wasn't the way I was planning to go, but I just won't walk anymore. There is nothing more for us, you should give up as well, or you will die walking\"\n\nI honestly never had actual hope on finding an exit, but after a lot more of walking, the scenery started changing again.\n\nI saw it all again, I saw the end of the tunnel, the fabric, the church, and finally I reached that 18th century scenario once more.\n\nI could not believe my eyes. I had finally reached the entrance.\n\nopposing all my soul was telling me, I had to go back for my friends, but after I got through the fabric scenery, there was no tunnel anymore...\n\nwhat was before an infinite path surrounded by a concave brick wall, now wasn't more than a few meters deep, with a brick wall by the end.\n\nI could not believe it. \n\nas I made my way once again to the entrance, completely alone, I was questioning everything that had happened up to this point. people don't simply disappear like that, but they simply vanished.\n\nI reached the main door, surrounded by the 18th century theme, and as I grabbed the doorknob, all the outside noise suddenly reappeared.\n\nas the sun burned my eyes, i closed the door behind me, and jumped the gate to finally get over that nightmare.\n\nand that is how that exploration went...",

Scientists had been searching for a new habitable planet for years, and finally, they had found one that showed hope for the human race. A team of scientists and astronauts were assembled, handpicked for their expertise and bravery, to embark on a mission to explore this distant planet in a galaxy far, far away. They were led by Captain Elizabeth Rodriguez, a brilliant and ambitious astronaut who had devoted her entire career to space exploration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaptain Elizabeth Rodriguez was a trailblazer in the field of space exploration. She had devoted her entire career to the pursuit of knowledge and discovery, and she had always been driven by a sense of curiosity and adventure. She had a natural talent for leadership and had quickly risen through the ranks of NASA, earning the respect and admiration of her colleagues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a young woman, she had faced many challenges and obstacles, but she had never given up. She had worked tirelessly to earn her degrees in engineering and astronautics, and she had always been willing to put in the extra work to achieve her goals. She was known for her intelligence, her work ethic, and her determination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe team consisted of six members, each with their unique set of skills and personalities. John, the pilot, was a thrill-seeker at heart. He had always been drawn to the excitement of flying and had worked tirelessly to become a skilled pilot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSarah, the medic, was a compassionate and empathetic soul. She had always been passionate about helping others and had become a doctor to fulfill that goal. \n\nDavid, the geologist, was a history buff, who had always been fascinated by the Earth's history and had studied the planet's geology in depth. \n\nMichael, the physicist, was a curious mind who was always searching for answers to the mysteries of the universe. He had devoted his career to studying the laws of physics. \n\nAlex and Mia, the engineers, were a dynamic duo who had been friends since childhood. They were tech geeks and had always been fascinated by technology and machines. They had decided to pursue careers in engineering together and had graduated from top universities. They were known for their problem-solving skills and their ability to think outside the box, and they had a knack for coming up with creative solutions to the most complex problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mission was to explore the planet, and if possible, establish a colony on it, to ensure the survival of humanity. The team was equipped with the most advanced technology and resources available, but they knew that the journey would be long and treacherous. They were aware of the risks, but they were determined to succeed, for the sake of humanity.\n\nAs they blasted off into space, they were filled with a sense of excitement and wonder. They were about to embark on the most important journey of their lives, and they knew that they were making history. But as they journeyed deeper into space, they began to encounter strange and inexplicable phenomena that caused the ship to fail. \n\nThey began to experience a series of strange malfunctions, including power fluctuations and communication disruptions. The ship's instruments would randomly malfunction and they would get strange readings on their screens. They would hear strange noises coming from the ship and they would see strange shadows moving on the walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the team struggled to find a way to fix the ship and return home, they were faced with the dire reality that their supplies were rapidly running out. They were running low on food, water, and oxygen, and they knew that their survival was at stake. The situation was dire, and they knew that they had to find a solution before it was too late. The pressure was on, and they were pushed to their limits as they raced against time to repair the ship and make it back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite their best efforts, they were unable to fix the ship and they were stranded in space. They were trapped in a never-ending cycle of horror, and they couldn't find a way to break free. The days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months. They were stuck in the vast expanse of space, with no hope of rescue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the months passed, the team started to go insane. They were plagued by hallucinations and delusions, and they were consumed by a sense of despair and hopelessness. They were haunted by visions of a dark and twisted future, where they were the only ones left alive, trapped in a world overrun by chaos and destruction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn, the pilot, became paranoid and delusional, convinced that they were being pursued by an unknown entity, He had locked himself in the cockpit, convinced that something was chasing him and that he was never going to make it back home.. \n\nSarah, the medic, became frail and weak from the harsh conditions of space, withdrawn and melancholic, haunted by the memories of the patients she had been unable to save.\n\nDavid, the geologist, became consumed by a dangerous obsession. He fixated on the idea of finding a way to terraform the planet they were orbiting, and make it habitable. He spent every waking moment pouring over data and researching ways to manipulate the planet's atmosphere and soil. He became increasingly erratic in his behavior, talking to himself and losing touch with reality. He started to believe that the only way to survive was to leave the ship and make the planet habitable. He began to hatch a plan to exit the ship and try to terraform the planet on his own, despite the obvious danger and the team's protests. He became convinced that it was their only hope for survival and was willing to risk everything, even his own life, to make it happen. The rest of the crew watched in horror as David's descent into madness deepened, and they knew that they had to stop him before it was too late, he attempted to exit the ship, but his suit was damaged, and he died instantly.\n\nMichael, the physicist, became increasingly withdrawn and isolated as the mission progressed. He became consumed with the mysteries of the universe, and spent most of his time locked away in his lab, pouring over data and running calculations. He was driven by a burning desire to understand the secrets of the cosmos, and he became increasingly absorbed in his work, to the point of neglecting his duties and his relationships with the rest of the team, as his isolation and obsession with the mysteries of the universe seemed to be taking a toll on his mental state.\n\nAlex and Mia, the engineers, became increasingly paranoid and aggressive as the mission progressed. They became convinced that they were being sabotaged and that their ship was being tampered with. They would spend hours pouring over data and inspecting the ship's systems, searching for any signs of foul play. They would become increasingly erratic in their behavior, lashing out at their colleagues and accusing them of being involved in the alleged sabotage. They would become more and more agitated and violent, convinced that their lives were in danger. Their colleagues were deeply concerned for their well-being and knew that they needed to intervene before their paranoia and delusions escalated further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the situation on the ship became more dire, the team members began to lose their grip on reality. They became increasingly hostile and paranoid towards each other, and their mental and emotional states began to deteriorate. Captain Elizabeth, found herself losing control over the situation. She tried to keep the team together and maintain order, but her efforts became increasingly futile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As the supplies dwindled and the tension rose, the team members began to turn on each other. John, the pilot, was the first to snap, he became paranoid and delusional, convinced that they were being pursued by an unknown entity. He attacked the rest of the team, and in the chaos, Sarah, the medic, was killed trying to protect the others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The rest of the team, Michael, Alex and Mia, became increasingly paranoid and aggressive, believing that they were being sabotaged. They turned on each other, and in the chaos, Michael was killed trying to protect himself. Alex and Mia, driven by their paranoid delusions, killed each other in a final violent confrontation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaptain Elizabeth Rodriguez, the leader of the mission, was the only one left alive, the last survivor of the doomed mission. She knew that she was going to die alone in the cold emptiness of space. She closed her eyes and let out a sigh, knowing that her time was up. Her body floated aimlessly in space, a silent testament to the tragedy of the ill-fated mission. Her spirit, haunted by the memory of her crewmates and the guilt of her poor decision, would remain trapped in the cold emptiness of space forever, a grim reminder of the dangers and horrors",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there were four friends named Vanessa, Michael, Olivia, and David. They had been friends since they were kids and loved going on adventures together. One summer, they decided to take a camping trip deep into the forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they set up camp, they noticed that the forest seemed eerily quiet. There were no birds singing, no animals rustling in the bushes, nothing. But they shrugged it off and decided to explore the forest a bit before the sun went down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they walked deeper into the forest, they started to feel like they were being watched. They would catch glimpses of shadows moving in the corner of their eyes, but when they turned to look, there was nothing there. They all laughed it off as their imagination and continued on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as the sun began to set, they realized they had gotten lost. They tried to retrace their steps, but nothing looked familiar. They were starting to panic when they heard a faint whispering in the distance. They followed the sound, hoping it would lead them back to camp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they got closer to the whispering, they realized it wasn't just one voice, it was multiple voices, all speaking at once. They couldn't make out what they were saying, but it was a language they had never heard before. They were terrified and didn't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, they came upon an old, abandoned cabin in the middle of the forest. The whispering was coming from inside. Without thinking, they burst into the cabin and were confronted with a sight they would never forget. Inside, there were dozens of people, all of them with blank, expressionless faces, sitting around a large table. They were all whispering in unison, and the friends realized that they were all speaking the same language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe friends tried to run, but the people in the cabin seemed to come alive, chasing after them with a strange and terrifying energy. The friends were able to outrun them, not long after, they realized that the forest seemed to be closing in on them. The trees were growing closer together, and the path they had taken to get to the cabin was now blocked by thick underbrush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey tried to find another way out, but every path they took seemed to lead them back to the cabin. They were trapped and didn't know what to do. They started to hear the whispering again, this time louder and more urgent. It was coming from all around them, and they couldn't tell where it was coming from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey spent the night huddled around the campfire, too scared to sleep. They knew they had to find a way out of the forest before morning, or they would be trapped there forever. They set out at first light, determined to escape the forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they walked, they began to notice that the trees were changing. The leaves were turning black, and the branches twisted and gnarled. The whispering grew louder and louder, until it was almost deafening. They could hear words now, and they were all in the same language as the people in the cabin. But they still couldn't understand what they were saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they walked, they started to see things in the shadows. Creatures that looked like they were made of darkness, following them through the forest. They were fast and silent, and the friends knew that if they were caught, they would be in serious trouble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, after what felt like hours, they saw a glimmer of light through the trees. They knew they were close to the edge of the forest, and they pushed on with renewed energy. But just as they were about to break through the trees, they were confronted by a figure that seemed to be made of shadows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was tall and thin, with long, twisted fingers and a face that was nothing but darkness. It spoke to them in the same language as the whispering, but this time they understood every word. It told them that they had trespassed on sacred ground, and that they would never leave the forest alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe friends were paralyzed with fear, but they knew they had to run. They turned and sprinted towards the light, not looking back until they had broken through the trees and were back on the road. They were panting and sweating, their hearts pounding with fear. They had never been so scared in their lives. They looked back at the forest, but it was now just a dense wall of trees. They could see no sign of the cabin or the creatures that had chased them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the whispering was still there, it was still calling out to them. They could hear it in their minds, even though it was no longer audible. It was a haunting, persistent sound that they knew they would never be able to escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey decided to make a run for their car, which was parked a few miles away. It was their only hope of getting out of the forest and far away from the mysterious cabin and the creatures that lurked in the shadows. They ran as fast as they could, but their legs were weak and heavy, and they were still disoriented from getting lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they got closer to the car, they could see that something was wrong. The car was turned over on its side, with all its windows smashed. They could see that the inside of the car had been torn apart, and they knew that whatever had been chasing them had found it first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey were trapped, with no means of escape. They had no choice but to try and survive the night. They huddled together, trying to stay warm, and to keep the fear from overwhelming them. They knew that the creatures would come for them soon, and they had to be ready for whatever came next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the night went on, they heard strange noises, rustling and scratching, coming from the darkness. They knew that the creatures were closing in, and that their time was running out. They decided to make a final stand and fight for their lives. They gathered whatever sticks and rocks they could find, and waited for the creatures to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen they finally appeared, they were even more terrifying than they had imagined. They were twisted and deformed, with eyes that glowed with an otherworldly light. They seemed to be made of shadows and darkness, and they had no mercy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe friends fought with all their might, but they were no match for the creatures. They were dragged away into the darkness, never to be seen again. But the whispering remained, echoing through the forest, a reminder of the horror that had occurred there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe forest was now known as a place of death, and it was said that those who ventured in would never come out. And the whispers of the four friends would forever be heard in the depths of the forest, a haunting reminder of the terror that lurked in the shadows.",

        "text": "In the year 2097, the world was on the brink of collapse. Climate change had ravaged the Earth, and resources were running low. Scientists had been searching for a new habitable planet for years, and finally, they had found one that showed hope for the human race. A team of scientists and astronauts were assembled, handpicked for their expertise and bravery, to embark on a mission to explore this distant planet in a galaxy far, far away. They were led by Captain Elizabeth Rodriguez, a brilliant and ambitious astronaut who had devoted her entire career to space exploration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaptain Elizabeth Rodriguez was a trailblazer in the field of space exploration. She had devoted her entire career to the pursuit of knowledge and discovery, and she had always been driven by a sense of curiosity and adventure. She had a natural talent for leadership and had quickly risen through the ranks of NASA, earning the respect and admiration of her colleagues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a young woman, she had faced many challenges and obstacles, but she had never given up. She had worked tirelessly to earn her degrees in engineering and astronautics, and she had always been willing to put in the extra work to achieve her goals. She was known for her intelligence, her work ethic, and her determination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe team consisted of six members, each with their unique set of skills and personalities. John, the pilot, was a thrill-seeker at heart. He had always been drawn to the excitement of flying and had worked tirelessly to become a skilled pilot. Sarah, the medic, was a compassionate and empathetic soul. She had always been passionate about helping others and had become a doctor to fulfill that goal. David, the geologist, was a history buff, who had always been fascinated by the Earth's history and had studied the planet's geology in depth. Michael, the physicist, was a curious mind who was always searching for answers to the mysteries of the universe. He had devoted his career to studying the laws of physics. Alex and Mia, the engineers, were a dynamic duo who had been friends since childhood. They were tech geeks and had always been fascinated by technology and machines. They had decided to pursue careers in engineering together and had graduated from top universities. They were known for their problem-solving skills and their ability to think outside the box, and they had a knack for coming up with creative solutions to the most complex problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mission was to explore the planet, and if possible, establish a colony on it, to ensure the survival of humanity. The team was equipped with the most advanced technology and resources available, but they knew that the journey would be long and treacherous. They were aware of the risks, but they were determined to succeed, for the sake of humanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they blasted off into space, they were filled with a sense of excitement and wonder. They were about to embark on the most important journey of their lives, and they knew that they were making history. But as they journeyed deeper into space, they began to encounter strange and inexplicable phenomena that caused the ship to fail. They began to experience a series of strange malfunctions, including power fluctuations and communication disruptions. The ship's instruments would randomly malfunction and they would get strange readings on their screens. They would hear strange noises coming from the ship and they would see strange shadows moving on the walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the team struggled to find a way to fix the ship and return home, they were faced with the dire reality that their supplies were rapidly running out. They were running low on food, water, and oxygen, and they knew that their survival was at stake. The situation was dire, and they knew that they had to find a solution before it was too late. The pressure was on, and they were pushed to their limits as they raced against time to repair the ship and make it back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite their best efforts, they were unable to fix the ship and they were stranded in space. They were trapped in a never-ending cycle of horror, and they couldn't find a way to break free. The days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months. They were stuck in the vast expanse of space, with no hope of rescue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the months passed, the team started to go insane. They were plagued by hallucinations and delusions, and they were consumed by a sense of despair and hopelessness. They were haunted by visions of a dark and twisted future, where they were the only ones left alive, trapped in a world overrun by chaos and destruction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn, the pilot, became paranoid and delusional, convinced that they were being pursued by an unknown entity, He had locked himself in the cockpit, convinced that something was chasing him and that he was never going to make it back home.. Sarah, the medic, became frail and weak from the harsh conditions of space, withdrawn and melancholic, haunted by the memories of the patients she had been unable to save. David, the geologist, became consumed by a dangerous obsession. He fixated on the idea of finding a way to terraform the planet they were orbiting, and make it habitable. He spent every waking moment pouring over data and researching ways to manipulate the planet's atmosphere and soil. He became increasingly erratic in his behavior, talking to himself and losing touch with reality. He started to believe that the only way to survive was to leave the ship and make the planet habitable. He began to hatch a plan to exit the ship and try to terraform the planet on his own, despite the obvious danger and the team's protests. He became convinced that it was their only hope for survival and was willing to risk everything, even his own life, to make it happen. The rest of the crew watched in horror as David's descent into madness deepened, and they knew that they had to stop him before it was too late, he attempted to exit the ship, but his suit was damaged, and he died instantly. Michael, the physicist, became increasingly withdrawn and isolated as the mission progressed. He became consumed with the mysteries of the universe, and spent most of his time locked away in his lab, pouring over data and running calculations. He was driven by a burning desire to understand the secrets of the cosmos, and he became increasingly absorbed in his work, to the point of neglecting his duties and his relationships with the rest of the team, as his isolation and obsession with the mysteries of the universe seemed to be taking a toll on his mental state. Alex and Mia, the engineers, became increasingly paranoid and aggressive as the mission progressed. They became convinced that they were being sabotaged and that their ship was being tampered with. They would spend hours pouring over data and inspecting the ship's systems, searching for any signs of foul play. They would become increasingly erratic in their behavior, lashing out at their colleagues and accusing them of being involved in the alleged sabotage. They would become more and more agitated and violent, convinced that their lives were in danger. Their colleagues were deeply concerned for their well-being and knew that they needed to intervene before their paranoia and delusions escalated further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the situation on the ship became more dire, the team members began to lose their grip on reality. They became increasingly hostile and paranoid towards each other, and their mental and emotional states began to deteriorate. Captain Elizabeth, found herself losing control over the situation. She tried to keep the team together and maintain order, but her efforts became increasingly futile. As the supplies dwindled and the tension rose, the team members began to turn on each other. John, the pilot, was the first to snap, he became paranoid and delusional, convinced that they were being pursued by an unknown entity. He attacked the rest of the team, and in the chaos, Sarah, the medic, was killed trying to protect the others. The rest of the team, Michael, Alex and Mia, became increasingly paranoid and aggressive, believing that they were being sabotaged. They turned on each other, and in the chaos, Michael was killed trying to protect himself. Alex and Mia, driven by their paranoid delusions, killed each other in a final violent confrontation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaptain Elizabeth Rodriguez, the leader of the mission, was the only one left alive, the last survivor of the doomed mission. She knew that she was going to die alone in the cold emptiness of space. She closed her eyes and let out a sigh, knowing that her time was up. Her body floated aimlessly in space, a silent testament to the tragedy of the ill-fated mission. Her spirit, haunted by the memory of her crewmates and the guilt of her poor decision, would remain trapped in the cold emptiness of space forever, a grim reminder of the dangers and horrors",

        "text": "I know that this sounds like the kind of advice to anyone left alone in the house at night but this is different. \n\nIt started a week ago, I was in bed it had just turned 01:00, I was scrolling on my phone while my wife Steph was asleep. I suddenly had a notification pop up at the top of my phone. Anyone with a video doorbell will be accustomed to this. ‘Motion Detected’. I normally ignore it as it was either a car coming down the road or a person stumbling back home after a night out. Then the doorbell chimed, the notification followed ‘There is a person at your front door’. \n\nI opened the app, there sure enough was a young woman standing, clinging onto my doorframe. I answered “Hello, can I help you?”, she came back immediately “Please let me in, someone is chasing me”. I told her to stay where she was and I would call the police. I heard her again “Please let me in, he’s going to hurt me, please hurry”. At this point my wife woke up, she asked me what I was doing. As I put some clothes on ready to go downstairs, I said there was a woman at our door begging to come in as someone was chasing her. I was about to dial for the police when Steph opened the app. She said “babe, no one is there”.\n\nWe looked back on the motion history, both notifications were logged. I opened the first one, nothing but our front porch. I proceeded to the other notification, where someone had pressed the doorbell. There was my front porch, shrouded in darkness but this time we could hear only my voice. Of course there was no response to my questions. I thought to myself, was I going crazy?! My wife said it was late, I must have been half asleep and my mind was playing tricks on me. Even if that was right, it still didn’t explain why we got the notifications. \n\nThe next night we both sat bingeing a Netflix show in our living room. We must have lost track of time as it was nearly 1 in the morning. I went to check the back door was locked when my phone buzzed. I asked Steph whether she had the same. She had. I opened the app just as it notified me that someone had pressed the bell. We both quickly opened the live view, stood at our door, a child. \n\nThe young boy must have been no older than 8, the camera was in night vision which was black and white. The boy’s face glowed, eyes piercing through my screen. I once again answered “Hello, can I help” the kid looked up at the camera, “Hi, my daddy broke down just up the road and his phone is dead. Can you please let me in, I need to use your phone”. Me and Steph looked at each other, she shook her head at me. I replied to him “I can call someone out for you or maybe the police can help?”. The boy then seemed to turn, his voice now had anger to it “open the door I need help, are you really going to let me stay out here all alone?”. His story had changed, I went back after swallowing my own fear “stay there I will get help”. \n\nThis time I called the police, they came around 20 minutes later. By this point no one was around, we had seen the boy walk off around the corner 5 minutes after I had got off the phone. The officers checked our road and the surrounding area. They found no people, not even the odd car driving around. We both tried to show them the app but obviously, there was nothing there. The two officers were understanding and seemed to believe us. They gave us the departments direct number and told us to call them if anything happens again.\n\nWe went to bed that night scared and confused, we didn’t understand what or why this was happening to us. The next day we decided to get an early night, we made sure everything was locked and the house secure. We both fell asleep early, I was woken up at just gone 01:00 to the sound of two sets of buzzing from my phone. I ignored these, I just rolled over and went back to sleep. When I looked at my phone in the morning I opened up the doorbell app. The video playback showed nothing, but I could hear scratching for about 2-3 seconds after the apparent press of the bell. I went downstairs and checked the door. Three sets of four deep scratches went down my front door. The anxiety hit me like a tidal wave going throughout my body. I now feared the night ahead of us.\n\nTwo nights ago we both had decided to stay up, we were going to put an end to this. We were on edge in our own home and it just wasn’t right. The minutes drew closer to that damned time 01:00. Then right on schedule, the notifications started. I opened the app, now stood there one of the policeman. He was one of the officers that was with us the other night. I thought it was strange, it caught me off guard. Steph said that she will look out the window upstairs. We had both said earlier that one of us would look out the window to confirm if someone really was there. \n\nI answered the door “Hello officer, can I help you?” He looked into the camera “we have an update on the problem you have been having, can you please open the door”. I felt a sense of confliction come over me, this didn’t feel right. I had watched enough police programs and dramas to know they usually have to report to places with another officer. The lack of any police cars also unnerved me. “Sorry officer, I’m sure you can understand the reluctancy to open the door due to our situation”. He snapped back “It’s fine, I am an officer of the law and instructing you to please open up, I need to come in and update you!” Now I knew something was wrong, his whole demeanour was now completely different to when we spoke two nights ago. I watched as his head looked upwards.\n\nI heard my wife scream the words “His eyes! What the fuck?!” I rushed up the stairs my feet slipping as I ran, I saw Steph but she looked petrified. She stared at me blankly and said “you need to let him in, he will help us”. I uttered back struggling to catch my breath “we can’t, you know we can’t! What did you see? What was wrong with his eyes?!” She tilted her head at me her eyes began to roll upwards “let him in…. Let. Him. In.”. Her tone started to change, it was turning into a gravelly rasping voice. Her face now full of anger as she screamed at me “LET HIM IN NOW”. \n\nI grabbed her and shook her while shouting “Steph, listen to me, snap out of it!”. She looked back at me dazed and confused. She said wearily, with tears in her eyes “I want to go to bed”, I said “only if you are ok”. She said she was fine and didn’t know what happened. I checked the video feed once more, no one was there. It took me a few hours to fall asleep worrying about what happened to Steph. \n\nWhen I woke the next morning Steph was gone, her phone and jewellery left on the bedside cabinet. I went downstairs and searched for her but nothing, she wasn’t in the house. I called the police department on the number I was given, I spoke to the partner of the policeman that was at my door. I told him everything that happened and that my wife had gone missing. They told me the officer that was stood at my door 8 hours earlier was on leave. He flew out on holiday yesterday morning, it couldn’t have been him.\n\nIn the hours ahead a search team was assembled and I joined them in searching the local area. There was no sign of her. It’s now 11pm, I’m sitting alone in my living room, my head now full of fear and radiating pain. I just want my Steph home, I just want normality back. \n\nHere it comes 12:59.\n\n3, 2, 01:00, the notifications came through, I opened the app. \n\nSteph was at the front door, I was almost half expecting it. I said “where were you honey”. She looked into the camera “I was taken, but I escaped and I’m here now. Let me in and I will tell you all about it”. \nI took a deep sigh.\n“Ok, I will be there in a minute babe”.\n\nWhat can I do? She is my wife. I have nothing without her.  \n\nI wrote all of this throughout this evening, hoping for some sort of closure, maybe even a happy ending to this horrible experience. I guess now it will just be a piece of evidence on what happened to us both.\n\nI need to go answer the door now.\n\nMy wife is home.",

        "text": "Every single night at seemingly random times, something knocks on my door. Sometimes it is a heavy, desperate beating, and others it’s quiet and soft. But no matter what I do, it always happens. I’ve sort of grown accustomed to it until recently.\n\nIt began about 2 months ago when I had just moved into the home. 1 bed 1 bath, near a relatively quiet street. It was all I could ever dream of. The indications of the past presence of the homeowners still scattered the abode. Old candy wrappers, crumbs and the occasional lost toy or two. But that would be fixed in time.\n\nIt was when I was going to bed for the first night there when I heard something. 3 knocks at the front door. They were very, very loud. I thought the house was going to come off the foundation for a moment. Believing it was important, I rushed to the door. I quickly unlocked it as fast as I could.\n\nHowever, nobody was at the door.\n\nI chuckled to myself, believing it to be just a simple ding dong ditch that some kids pulled on me. Although I thought it strange they didn’t just use the doorbell installed. However, I tiredly jotted back to my bed, awaiting the next day.\n\nThat next morning I finally got a moment to meet the community members. One of whom was my next door neighbor Fred. Me and Fred liked eachother right off the bat. We even went to the same college a few years apart. We spent that day talking about our lives when I brought up the knocking that happened last night.\n\nWhen I brought it up, Fred immediately went from a carefree grin to a concerned gaze. When I asked him what was wrong, he said  “The people before you also complained about knocking a week earlier. I think it’s what motivated them to hurry up with their moving.”\n\nWhen I asked if they saw anything, Fred just shook his head. “Probably just some troublemakers. I wouldn’t let it concern you.” And with that we said our goodbyes. At that point I had just brushed off the knocking and went back home.\n\nWhen the knocking happened again, it happened while I was in a deep slumber. 3 knocks even louder then the first. It had woken me up, but I brushed it off as another attempt to prank me. When I woke I barely even remembered the knocking until I was having my morning coffee and saw the window cracked. \n\nI called the police; however, nothing came of it. No evidence of the culprit or where they went off to. When I asked the officers if this had happened before, they simply said “Nope.” They told me they would be on watch and to keep my doors locked incase they tried to get in.\n\nAnd with that they were off in their cruisers. Although it became more apparent that whoever these “pranksters” they were determined to make me fall for the trick. Even breaking my window to try and get a rye out of me.\n\nThis time I thought they wouldn’t try again because they had already tried with no results. So I went to bed and again I heard 3 knocks. It was much, much quieter. Almost sounding as if the wind itself was doing it. I again bolted to the door and found nobody. No damage to the windows either. \n\nOver the next 2 months I had grown used to it, thinking whoever was doing it would just give up. However they did not. The same 3 knocks; however, none of them were as loud as the first one. I had just accepted that it was a sacrifice for having such a good house.\n\nThat was until the knock happened at my bedroom window. Opening my eyes slowly revealed, nobody was there. Of course I was immediately put on edge throughout the night, not closing my eyes once. \n\nTo say I was tired that morning was an understatement. I needed 3 cups of coffee to even get myself to drive to work. I then got to sleep at the tiny intervals my boss wasn’t watching me. Enough to get me through once work ended.\n\nHowever, when I wasn’t sleeping I made a plan. My neighbor Fred would watch from outside the house to see who it was and catch them. Possibly give them a long talk on what trespassing laws and harassment were. Then send them on there way.\n\nWhen night came, my body immediately fell asleep. Hoping to finally catch whoever was doing this. \n\nThat’s when I heard it, 3 knocks as always. I immediately texted Fred to see if they caught them, but he said nobody was outside the house. It’s when I got that message I heard 3 knocks outside my bedroom door.\n\nIt’s at that moment I realized the knocking was happening inside the home.",

        "text": "A decade ago, my little brother, Sam, was eaten by the rain. My therapist said that I was traumatized by losing my brother, that I must have hallucinated it or made it up. But I know what happened. \n\nTen years ago, my brother burst in through the door talking a mile a minute, as was typical for him. \"Hey, did you hear about the hurricane?\" \n\nI slouched further down in my chair and ignored him. Sam was fourteen and obsessed with meteorology, to a degree that was honestly concerning. He stood outside with his face upturned whenever it snowed, binged Storm Chasers at least once a week, and when his homemade weather balloon had failed to get off the ground, he had been inconsolable for weeks. \n\n\"Maria, get off your phone and listen to me.\" He pitched his voice way down as he said it, copying the way our father would talk whenever he was disappointed.\n\nI boobed his nose with my middle finger and went back to the pictures of rabbits in top hats that I was browsing through. \n\nSam stomped his foot and glared at me, his expression reminiscent of a disgruntled cat. “My readings say that there’s going to be a hurricane!” \n\nOur parents had gotten Sam about a dozen pieces of equipment last week, as an apology for having to leave. They worked at the same company and often went on long trips, leaving our uncle to take care of us. Our uncle didn’t want anything to do with us, really, but our parents paid him two hundred dollars per week, and he was a raging alcoholic who was constantly bumming off people, so he made sure that we at least had food. But most of the time, he disappeared off to wherever he went when he wasn’t with us, and we were glad to see him go. \n\nThe stuff that Sam got was pretty nice, all shiny metal and sturdy structures. I had no idea what any of it was. He had tried to explain it to me once, but I had stopped paying attention when he started talking about barometers. He had set it all up on a hill about a mile from our house, and he called it his laboratory. \n\n“I was at my laboratory, and I double-checked everything, and it was still right! There’s going to be a hurricane, or at least a really big storm, in twenty minutes, we’ve gotta tell people. I’ve got to measure it, so that everyone knows.” He was practically vibrating with tension, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. \n\nI glanced out the window, where it was sunny and cloudless. “Sure. Just come sit down, Sam.”\n\nHe gave me the most betrayed look I had ever seen, but he did eventually plop down next to me, grumbling the whole way. “Just wait a little bit, and then you’ll see.” The frantic confidence of before was gone. He seemed unsure. \n\nI’ve lived in a small coastal town in the Southeast United States for most of my life, so I’m no stranger to hurricanes. There’s always frantic activity right before the storm hits. Boards or at the very least tape go over the windows, county-provided sandbags pile outside the door and are strewn haphazardly along the outside walls, three days worth of water and battery-powered flashlights are acquired. Everything was calm outside, the neighborhood and the weather, so I didn’t listen to Sam. \n\nI should have. We were there for barely ten minutes before it started. It was just a soft wind, at first; a whisper of air against the side of the house, a couple raindrops flung softly against the window. \n\n“See?” Sam said, triumphant. “I told you.” \n\nI got up to look out the window, discomforted. “Yeah. I guess you did.” \n\nHe leaped up with a twinkle in his eye. “I’ve got to go record this! I’ll be right back, I promise.” \n\nWithout another word, he left before I could stop him, no doubt heading for his laboratory. \n\n“Sam! Wait a second,” I called after him, but he didn’t look back. I sighed and turned away, figuring that he would come back eventually. \n\nHalf an hour later, Sam wasn’t back and the hurricane had hit with full force. The house was shaking with the force of it, and I couldn’t shake the worry that Sam had tripped on a rock and was lying unconscious somewhere. I sat there, chewing on my nails with anxiety, for far too long before I got up to follow him. \n\nIf you’ve never been outside during a real storm, then you’re lucky. It’s not something I would wish on anyone. \n\nThe wind battered me with every movement, making me lose my balance again and again. Every single door was open, and every window too, in every direction I looked. There were no cars in the driveways, and the only lights on were the streetlamps, bathing everything in a buzzing, sickly yellow. I spun in a circle, searching desperately for any sign of Sam. There was nothing, and I’m not proud of it, but I gave up. I couldn’t take the constant drumming of the rain anymore. I told myself that Sam was probably fine, that I’d look for him later, and then I ran for the nearest house. The open door loomed over me, more oppressive than a simple slab of wood should be, but still shoved my way through, too glad to get inside. I rationalized it to myself. Everyone else had probably evacuated. The doors had probably been blown open by the wind. \n\nI stepped over the threshold, breathing a preemptive sigh of relief—and the rain didn’t stop. It didn’t make sense, I was inside, with a roof over my head, but I still felt every drop hit me. They phased through the ceiling like it wasn’t even there, leaving me with no shelter.\n\nThere’s this great short story by Ray Bradbry called The Long Rain. It tells the story of four men, trapped on a planet that never stops raining. I had to read it in school, an eternity ago, and at the time I thought it was stupid. It was just rain, that’s what I thought, there’s no way it could have been that bad. I know better now. There’s an exhaustion that comes with your mind being battered to pieces in your skull by the constant, constant rain. The pounding of it becomes a metronome that is almost impossible to think around. The rhythm of my steps started lining up with each new sheet of rain crashing into me, a brainless march that could have led me over a cliff without me noticing. The only thing inside me was the rain. \n\nI walked, and walked, and walked, and walked and walked and didn’t stop for what felt like days. I was alone the entire time, nothing but me and the pounding of my feet as I kept walking. \n\nI don’t know how I escaped; I don’t remember it. Luck, probably. Or maybe the hurricane got bored of me. My first memory, after, is of waking up in the hospital with my parents clutching my hands. \n\nI didn’t talk for a week except to say one phrase. \n\n“Were you in the rain?” I asked them, over and over. “Were you in the rain? Were you in the rain?” \n\nMy parents told me that there was no rain. The last time it rained had been weeks ago, and today had been sunny and temperate. I searched for a sign that the rain had happened, scouring news sites for a single mention of the violent storm that I had almost been lost in. The only sign that anything had gone wrong at all was in Sam's laboratory. I went up the hill as soon as I got back from the hospital, desperate for some sort of proof, and I found the equipment broken on the ground. Every single thing was smashed to pieces, pulverized and scattered haphazardly around. My parents were distraught, but they thought it was an act of petty vandalism, and they never believed me when I told them that the storm had done it. They held out hope for Sam for years, but eventually they accepted that he wasn’t coming back. They even stopped blaming me for his death eventually. I have never given up hope, and I have never stopped blaming myself. \n\nPeople go missing during every hurricane, every flood. The search is always given up, eventually, once it’s obvious that anyone still lost must be dead. They're not, though. They're trapped in the storm, like I almost was, like Sam still is, wandering ceaselessly through an endless landscape of rain and wind. Bad weather seems to happen around me more often than before, and I refuse to go out in it. It feels like there’s something waiting for me, lurking on the periphery until it can capture me again. ",

        "text": "I’ve been hunting vampires for six years now and I used to think I was pretty good at it. Then again if you’re a trained killer like me, vampires aren’t all that different from anything else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’s a lot of misconceptions about them. People seem to think they’ve got magical powers or can only be killed in certain ways. Sunlight, a stake to the heart, stuff like that. None of it is necessarily true. Sunlight doesn’t actually do much to them. It doesn’t burn their skin or make them weaker. Their eyes are more attuned to low light conditions, so the only thing it does is make it ever so slightly harder for them to see. Garlic doesn’t do anything either. They’re a little more sensitive to smell I guess, but they’re no more put off by garlic than anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and crosses? Don’t even bother. The only reason people think vampires are afraid of crosses, is because most of the groups who’ve hunted them throughout history were Catholic. They don’t actually have any affect on them. If you throw up a cross at a vampire, the only thing that’ll do is buy you a few seconds as your soon to be killer laughs in your face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then, how do you kill a vampire?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever the hell you want. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, a lot of the old myths aren’t true. But that’s a two way street. Vampires can’t turn into bats, they can’t hypnotize you, fly or anything like that. Not naturally, anyways. There’s a few out there who’ve figured out how to use magic to make themselves even stronger but for most vampires the only leg they have up on you and me is that they’re a little bit stronger, a little bit faster and they don’t age. Other than that, you can kill them just as easily as you can kill anything else. Shoot it in the head, slit its throat, put a stake through its heart if you really want to. It doesn’t matter how you do it, so long as you confirm the kill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe personally? I’m simple. I put two bullets in their head and call it a day. That’s more than enough for your average vampire. You pop them in the head, and call it a day. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.\n\nIt’s the ones who use magic you should be afraid of… And even then, I’d killed a few of those too. They were tricky but they always slipped up. Always.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t think that the Maenad would be any different… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got the call from Edward Kelley about three days ago. He didn’t say much, only that something big was going down in San Francisco. The way he talked about it, it sounded like an all hands on deck type situation. The organization I work for has been hunting things like this for a very, very long time. They don’t put out calls like this for just anyone. I knew this wasn’t something I could ignore. So, I told Kelley I’d be in San Fran within the next day or so and I kept my word. Sure enough, the day after I’d arrived he sent me an email with a location and a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe location turned out to be the conference room of a fairly inexpensive hotel just outside of town. When I got there on the day of the meeting, there were already five other guys present, not including Kelley himself. They were already seated. A couple of them were people I only knew by their last names. It wasn’t good business to know too much besides that. The rest were strangers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKelley stood at the head of the table, waiting for me to close the door before he spoke.\n\n  “Mr. Moore. I’m glad you could join us.” He said, voice low and grave. I gave him a polite nod before taking an empty seat between the two men I recognized. One of them, Mr. Boyer returned my nod. The other one, Mr. Streeter barely even acknowledged me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Gentlemen, thank you for joining me here today.” Kelley began, “I understand I may have called some of you from a considerable distance away, but considering our target, I thought it necessary to have some of the best working on this with me. This one here is the real deal. Not one of those mosquitos you’ll find picking up their prey a bar.”\n\nKelley surveyed us as he spoke. The man looked like a grumpy brick wall on the best of days, but as he inspected us, I understood the solemn urgency in his gaze. If this vampire was half as bad as he said, then he probably needed to be sure he was bringing the right people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “We’ll need to be clever with this one. She and her sisters were the ones behind the Venice massacre back in the 1650s. She’s dangerous, she’s cunning and she won’t go quietly.”\n\n  “We’re dealing with a Venetian?” Boyer asked, “You’re talking about the Di Cesare’s, right? They’re still alive?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Very much so.” Kelley replied, “They pop on and off our radar, but they’re rarely ever in a place where we can get to them. In four hundred years, we’ve only ever managed to kill one. One. Out of thirteen. Can’t say it’s much of a track record. But now we’ve got ourselves a rare opportunity, and Grandmaster Ivory gave us the marching orders himself. God willing, we’ll be able to strike another one off the list tonight.”\n\n  “Which one is it exactly?” I asked, “What exactly should we expect to be up against?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “They call her Eris the Maenad. She’s something of a follower of Dionysus, in case the name didn’t tip you off. Can’t say we’ve got a hell of a lot of intel on her, so be prepared for anything. Before they became vampires, most of the Venetians were part of a coven of witches, and they’ve just grown smarter over the centuries. Call it a hunch but my gut tells me we’re gonna need a little more than a simple bullet to the head for her.”\n\n  “Not a problem.” One of the others said, “All we need to know is where she’ll be.”\n\nKelley shot the man a death glare before he started speaking again.\n\n  “As of tomorrow night, she’ll be at a club called the Twelve Underground. That’ll be our window.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Twelve Underground. I’d passed by it on my previous visits to San Francisco although I’d never been inside. That kind of thing wasn’t really my scene, but I’d seen the advertisements for it. It wasn’t much more than a seedy bar that mostly hosted no name bands, and bands that usually opened for actual headliners. Honestly, it probably wasn’t a bad place to find a vampire, but it was an even better place to find a maenad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “I’m gonna assume we’ve got a plan?” Boyer asked. He sat comfortably beside me, sounding more curious than concerned, “A witch that old is probably using some sort of protection spell.”\n\n  “I thought it was safe to assume so.” Kelley said, before looking towards Streeter near the end of the table, “Which is why I had Mr. Streeter here do a little bit of prep work. Mr. Streeter?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “There’s a charity show on at the Twelve Underground tomorrow night,” Streeter said. “At around 11, there will be a break as the first band finishes their set and the second one sets up. During that time, she’ll be on stage promoting their sponsor and she’ll be vulnerable. Given her experience, it’s likely she’ll be using an attribution spell. Shoot or stab her, and the wound appears on you instead. Since we don’t know where on her body the rune might be carved, the safest bet is to avoid harming her directly. So, I’ve taken the liberty of arranging for a little ‘surprise’ to be placed underneath the stage before she gets on there. We’ll be able to detonate it remotely.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “And blow the bitch to hell…” Kelley finished, “Now I’m gonna be righteously paranoid and assume that’s not going to kill her outright. But it should at least wound her enough so we can find a way to finish the job. And in case anything goes wrong, you all remember your training. Much as I’d rather not fight something like this out in the open, at least we’ll have a better chance as a group.”  \n\n  “What about the collateral?” One of the others asked, “There’ll be other people in that club.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll eyes shifted to him.\n\n  “Son, this is a high value target. Do you have any idea how dangerous the Di Cesare’s are?” Kelley asked, “They’ve been loose for four hundred years and they’ve left entire nations of corpses in their wake. Do you think they give half a shit about collateral? Because I can assure you, they don’t. If we fail here, then we won’t get another chance. Not only will she rip us limb from bloody limb, she’ll be in the wind for the next few centuries. We know where she’ll be. We have her here and now. So to answer your question, I don’t give a shit about the collateral. The collateral is necessary. now are you gonna pull up your frilly fucking panties, be a man and do the job that needs to be done, Mr. Thompson or are you gonna whine to me about collateral damage?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw Thompson recoil a little at what Kelley said, but he didn’t utter another word of protest. Satisfied, Kelley returned his attention to us.\n\n  “Now, do we have any other questions? Any other concerns?”\n\nNobody else spoke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Good. When the explosive detonates, I want you all armed. Assuming she’s still alive, move to subdue but don’t go for a killshot. Not unless we’ve confirmed there’s no attribution spell active. Once she’s subdued, we move her out of the building and onto the street. We’ll be taking her to a designated meeting place on the east end where we’ll be able to safely burn her. Are we clear?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the others nodded, as did I. Considering the reputation the Venetians had, the plan did sound fairly solid. Hell, it almost sounded easy… Kelley took a step back from the table, satisfied that we were all on the same page.\n\n  “Good. Tomorrow night then, seven o’clock. Be prepared.”\n\nWith that, we were done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made it to the Twelve Underground a half hour before we were due to meet up. I wasn’t the only one who was early either. I could see Streeter by the bar, dressed down to blend in and mingling as if he belonged there and I could see Thompson in a booth on the other side of the club. I didn’t speak to either of them. Instead, I ordered myself a beer and found a table, watching as the rest of the team trickled in. Kelley set himself up a few tables down from me, but didn’t so much as give me a look. That was just standard operating procedure though. Best not to make it too obvious that we knew each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the first amateur band came up on stage, I spent most of my time looking at my phone with mild disinterest. I nursed my beer through the night and even though I knew Kelley would disapprove, I allowed myself to have a second. I figured a slight buzz might calm my nerves. I’d killed more than my fair share of vampires before, but I also won’t pretend that the reality of going up against one of the Venetians didn’t scare me a little. I’d heard the stories about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur organization first ran into them back in the 1600s when they’d killed some vampire by the name of Di Cesare. He’d been some merchant working out of Venice, back when Venice was still its own republic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, whoever had killed him hadn’t done a very through job. Not only was Di Cesare’s widow also a vampire, but she apparently wasn’t too happy about her husband's death. So in retaliation, she’d hired herself a small army of soldiers and retaliated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe’d stormed our organization's Venetian headquarters and in doing so, found herself a coven of 12 witches they’d captured. They’d called themselves the Zodiac Sisters, each one supposedly representing a different sign of the Zodiac, but from what I’ve heard they really weren’t that notable. Just a bunch of young women meeting in the woods to play with the occult simply because they could. Nowadays, we wouldn’t trouble ourselves with something like that. But back then, they had a different attitude toward that sort of thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe it was the grief of losing her husband that made her do it. Maybe she recognized those witches as kindred spirits who wanted revenge just as badly as she did. Maybe it was something else entirely. Nobody really knows. But Di Cesare’s widow offered them the same curse she had. She offered them vampirism and they’d taken it. All 12 of them and in doing so, they became her daughters, bound in blood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTogether they’d run rampant throughout the Venetian Republic, butchering the Knights of our organization until the canals of Venice ran red with their blood. In the end they’d driven them out entirely, hence why some of us simply referred to them as ‘*The Venetians.*’ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Venice fell to Napoleon near the end of the 18th century, our people returned and when they did, they came back in force, looking for some revenge for the Venice Massacre. They even managed to kill one of the sisters, Gemini. Although they never so much as laid a finger on any of the others. Eventually, it was determined that Di Cesare’s widow and her daughters had abandoned Venice and sure enough, a few decades later they turned up in Brazil exporting precious metals. Our organization had tried to go after them, but everyone they sent either came back in a box, or didn’t come back at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest is history. These days, most people associate the Di Cesare name with the jewlery house they own and the Di Cesare sisters are for the most part, in the wind. Their mother runs the business and they just run rampant, doing whatever it is they want. After all, who’s going to stop them? Like Kelley said, in 400 years, we’d only ever managed to kill one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was confident in his plan for the Maenad of course, but I also wasn’t stupid enough to believe that there was no chance this could all go horribly wrong. All we needed was one little mistake, and we’d all be dead. I knew that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what was one more beer, right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the show went on, I scanned the crowd. The others were scattered around, waiting for Eris Di Cesare to show her face and at around the 10:30 mark, I finally spotted her. She was standing near the bar, watching one of the bands perform with a beer in her hand. She had long dark hair tied back into a ponytail and what I can only describe as a punk or goth aesthetic. She wore a weathered black band tee with a button down flannel shirt tied around her waist and ripped black leggings. Her lipstick was black as was her eyeshadow although she bounced and swayed to the music as if she was having the time of her life. She barely even seemed to be able to stop herself from dancing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was not exactly what I had envisioned when I’d heard we’d be hunting one of the Venetians… For Gods sake, she barely looked old enough to drink. But I recognized her from a photograph I’d seen on the website promoting this event. This was Eris Di Cesare alright. I was certain of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter getting herself another drink, she left the bar, heading in my direction. She moved with an exuberant bounce in her step and paused only briefly to mingle with a few people, but moved with purpose. As she got closer to my table, I tried not to stare, although I guess looking down at my beer attracted her attention anyways. A pair of black canvas sneakers had the laces done up in an odd pentagram pattern stopped by my table, and a cheerful voice spoke to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Heya! You doing alright? Don’t think I’ve seen you around before!” She said over the music, pausing to lean in against my table. I looked up at her and forced a smile. My eyes darted toward the tattoo of the *Aries* sign on the inside of her right wrist. Further proof that she was one of the Di Cesare sisters… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Yeah, I’m doing great!” I said, “You?”\n\n  “Fantastic!” She said, “Hell of a show we’ve got tonight. Hope you enjoy it! And let me know if you need anything, alright?”\n\n  “You work here?” I asked.\n\n  “I own here.” She replied, tipping me a wink.\n\n  “Oh wow… Nice place you’ve got here then!”\n\n  “Yeah, it’s a cozy little living.” She said, “Can’t say I hate it, music, parties every night. The good outweighs the bad, if you ask me. Plus, it’s nice to support a good cause every once in a while!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight, this was a charity show, wasn’t it?\n\n  “Yeah, it’s great. Live music, good cause. Yeah…”\n\nShe tilted her head slightly as she sized me up, her smile never fading. \n\n  “Stop by the bar later. I’ll set you up with a refill, on the house.” She said, “And thanks again for coming out tonight.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, she was gone, heading towards the stage. I checked my phone. Ten minutes until 11. She’d be making her announcement soon… \n\nI swallowed down the last of my beer and waited. My gun was in its holster. I was as ready to go as I was going to get.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the last band finished their set, the MC who’d been introducing the various bands came up again.\n\n  *“Alright ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Alien Island! Let’s hear it!”*\n\nThe people who’d actually been listening to that awful music clapped and cheered, but I got the feeling that it was more out of pity than anything else.\n\n  *“Up next, we’ve got The November Boys to close things out tonight. But before we get to that, we wanted to give a very special thank you to Eris Di Cesare for helping us put this on and letting us use this space. Please everybody, give her a big round of applause!”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe applause this time was a little more enthusiastic as Eris took the stage, waving as she bounded towards the MC and took the mic from him. \n\n  *“Thank you, thank you so much. You guys are being way too kind. Really, I should be thanking you for coming out tonight and supporting Homes for the Homeless. It’s a fantastic organization and one that’s made some real change in the community. So come on, give yourselves a round of applause!”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPredictably, the crowd loved that and Eris seemed to drink up their enthusiasm. Behind her, I could see some of the roadies switching out the instruments. One of them set an acoustic guitar right beside her. Oh God… was she going to sing? I hoped that Kelley would detonate that goddamn bomb before she started singing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked over in his direction to see him sitting at the same table, although his brow was furrowed in frustration. He was looking down at something. The detonator maybe? Was something wrong?\n\n  *“Yeah… you guys are awesome…”* Eris continued, *“But before we continue. I wanted to call out some special guests we’ve got here. A number of boys who were so kind to make the trek out from all across the west coast. Let me name some names here! Mr. Joseph Boyer…”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAcross the venue, I saw Boyer sit upright at the mention of his own name. His eyes suddenly went wide and I felt a sinking dread in my stomach. Kelley looked up as well and even in the low light, I could see the color draining from his face.\n\n  *“Mr. Brad Smith, Mr.  Arthur Casey, Mr. James Streeter, Mr. Troy Moore…”*\n\nMy name. My blood froze in my veins as I felt Eris looking right at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  *“And lastly but most importantly, Mr. Edward Kelley. Give these stalwart dumbfucks a round of applause, let’s go!”*\n\nThe crowd applauded as if she hadn’t just singled out the six of us. Kelley stood up, detonator in hand. He kept pressing the button, but nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  *“Oh? Did I make you mad?”* Eris asked, grinning from ear to ear. *“C’mon chuckles. Push that big red button and blow me straight back to hell!”* She paused, then tilted her head to the side.\n\n*“Not working, is it?”* She asked. \n\nFrom the crowd, I watched a man begin to climb up on stage and paused as I recognized him. Mr. Thompson. The only one of us that Eris hadn’t named. \n\n  *“You should choose your friends more carefully, Eddie,”* She said, holding the bag up like a trophy, *“Rookie mistake…”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKelley just stared at her in disbelief, his eyes shifted to Thompson at her side. Looking into his eyes, I could see that he knew we were already dead… The crowd just stared slack jawed up at Eris as she spoke, oblivious to the gravity of anything she said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw him going for his gun and I heard one gunshot ring out. The audience didn’t move. They barely even reacted. Kelley stumbled backward, clutching at his shoulder. He looked over toward the bar, where Streeter stood defiantly, a gun aimed at Kelley.\n\n  *“Kinda sad, actually.”* Eris said, *“But hey, you tried your best, right? Now… sit back, and enjoy the show.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw her toss the microphone aside and reach for the guitar. She dragged her nails across the strings, eliciting a sinister hissing noise. Her eyes settled on Kelley again as she began to play. She strummed fast, her fingers moving violently across the fretboard. The music she played hurt my head. It didn’t sound like any music a guitar would make. It was hard to say exactly what it sounded like. More like a flute of some sort I guess, although even that was stretching it. I can’t imagine how anyone could play a flute quite like that. The ear splitting sound of it made me flinch and scream as I clapped my hands over my ears. I tried to focus on her, but my vision was already going blurry. Looking at the guitar in her hands, I thought I could see some kind of ornate rune carved onto it, but it was hard to make out. I could taste blood in my mouth and the pain in my head was splitting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could hear Eris laughing over the music and as I struggled to pull myself out of my chair, I could see the crowd moving. The people around us started to dance. Only the dancing was… wrong. I don’t know how else to describe it. I’d never seen anything like this before, not from a witch or a vampire. Their bodies jerked like puppets on a string. They ground up against each other like animals. Beside me, I saw a man push a woman onto a table, kissing her deeply as he tore at her shirt. She was ripping at his pants all the while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEris kept strumming at that guitar, eyes on us all the while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see Boyer trying to push his way through the crowd to get to the door, but they were grabbing at him. Eris’s attention turned on him. The music changed in pitch slightly as the dancers pulled him back and then… Then I watched as they started to pull Boyer apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe screamed all the while as they tugged at his limbs, pulling at him. I didn’t think they could actually hurt him, but I saw him begin to break. I saw the fabric of his shirt ripping and staining with blood. I could see the skin stretching. His face was turning red as he screamed in agony. Those screams almost drowned out that terrible music. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEris was laughing again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the other men who’d come in with us, either Casey or Smith broke through the crowd a few feet away from Boyer. He stumbled against the bar and I saw two men race after him. Casey or Smith stumbled as he tried to get away from them, and they overtook him. They tackled him to the ground and I heard him scream as they sank their teeth into his skin. One of them bit into his cheek and ripped away an entire chunk of skin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEris kept playing. The song just got faster and more chaotic, barely even resembling music anymore. It sounded more like a maddening droning. I took one last look at Boyer just in time to see the crowd rip one of his arms from his body. I couldn’t look at anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThompson had leaped off the stage and into the crowd, joining in the madness. I’d lost track of Streeter as well. I could hear the screams of the other man we’d brought with us as he met some horrible fate I couldn’t see, and I was grateful that I didn’t have to watch him die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked over to where Kelley had been and saw him bracing himself against the table, struggling to stand. Up until then, my feet had been frozen to the ground, but upon seeing him, I finally found the strength to run again. I raced to his side to help him up, but Kelley swatted me off. I could hear a low, manic giggling noise and it took me a moment to realize that it was coming from him. His head turned toward me, and I took a step back, my pulse spiking in my chest as I saw the state he was in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrickles of blood ran from his eyes and ears, but he was wearing a rictus grin I’d never seen on him before. The gun still hung limply in his hand. He stared at me, smiling that dopey smile of his. I watched him take his free hand and jab a finger into the bullet wound in his shoulder. The sight of it made me flinch, but he didn’t even react to the pain. Instead, he just twisted the finger around then ripped it out. He brought his bloody finger to his lips, then traced a line up each of his cheeks, giving himself a crude, bloody smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Better luck next time…” He said, his voice unable to hide the trembling fear he truly felt. Still smiling, but with tears in his eyes, I watched him raise the gun to his chin.\n\n  “Wait, NO!” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached out to try and stop him. But he’d already pulled the trigger. I watched gore erupt from the back of his head to stain the wall behind him. His eyes rolled over into his skull as he collapsed hard to the ground.  I’ve seen death before. But watching Kelley blow his own brains out… It made me freeze like nothing else ever had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could hear Eris’s fingernails scratching against the strings again. Her laughter drowned out every other sound and finally, the music changed. Some other band was playing now. Although they didn’t sound much better, the music at least sounded like music. The chaos around me didn’t stop. People were still fucking on the tables. They ground against each other. Some of them were eating one of the bodies. And Eris stood atop the stage, drinking in the madness. She let the guitar drop to the ground before fixating her eyes on me. Then, like a tiger she was after me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI watched her leap into the crowd, pushing through it to reach me. I started running again, the music following me as I fled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made it past the crowd and to the door. I almost made it up the stairs and out onto the street. But then I felt a cold hand on my shoulder. Eris pulled me back, slamming me against the wall, still wearing that awful grin of hers.\n\n  “Hey there champ, where’s the fire?” She asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went for my gun. I knew there was a chance that shooting her would kill me, but I didn’t care. It was worth it! Before I could raise it to her head, she caught me by the wrist. My finger slipped on the trigger, firing a bullet into the ceiling but Eris didn’t even flinch. She just stared me dead in the eye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “I’m gonna pretend you didn’t just do that,” she said. “You should really be a little more polite, considering how nice I’ve been to you.” \n\n  “Fuck you!” I spat. Her smile didn’t even falter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Actually I think the words you’re looking for are ‘*thank you*’. You know I could’ve had them tear you apart like they did with your friends back there, but I always think it’s better to leave at least one survivor, you know? To tell the story. I’ll bet your friends will love it!”\n\n  “Why to stroke your own sick ego?” I said, trying and failing to sound brave.\n\n  “No! Never!” She said, then paused, shrugged and added, “Okay, *maybe* a little. But that’s not the main point. I’ve actually got a message for whoever’s pulling the strings in your little operation. So put your listening ears on, please. You ready?”\n\nShe leaned in, pressing her mouth to my ear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  *“You only still exist because we allow it. So don’t provoke us.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe pulled back, her playful smile having darkened into something far more sinister. I stared at her, my entire body trembling. \n\n  “Now go on, get out of here. I’ve gotta check how many donations we got. You really should support the charity. It’s a pretty good cause. Oh, and before you go!” She paused and snapped her fingers twice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the throng came Mr. Thompson, disheveled and with a shirt covered in blood. He held an unopened bottle of beer in his hand.\n\n  “I promised you one on the house.” She said, taking the beer from him and pushing it into my hand. She patted me on the shoulder and with that, she turned to leave. The bottle slipped out of my hand and shattered on the ground at my feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood still for a few moments, still shaking and breathing heavily. Then, when my composure finally returned, I started up the stairs again, burst out onto the street, and kept running until my legs wouldn’t carry me any further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy organization spent the next two days debriefing me, trying to understand where it all went wrong. The bodies of Kelley, Smith, Casey, and Boyer were never found. Streeter and Thompson both seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth. I think I’m the only one who knows what happened that night… well, the only one aside from Eris Di Cesare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the way they spoke to me, I got the impression they expected me to just sleep this all off like a bad hangover and get back to work. But I’m not that stupid. I can’t just forget the things I saw that night. I won’t just forget them. They might not listen to Eris Di Cesare’s warning, but I will. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve sent in my resignation, effective immediately. I’m done with [vampires.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)",

        "text": "Hi, I just have to get this out somewhere. Maybe I’ll connect with someone who’s been through this, or knows how to end it and get those involved prosecuted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I (34/M) used to drive for Uber. I met this girl who I started frequently driving, she was cute and fun and made me laugh. Eventually she starts selling me weed, we exchange numbers, and one thing led to the next, she becomes my girlfriend.\n\nThings are great at first, but rapidly go down hill. She becomes incredibly demanding, manipulative, is completely narcissistic, starts doing meth, has no interest in stopping, and then becomes physically abusive. I realize there’s no saving this relationship, and I break up with her.\n\nImmediately she starts driving by my house slowly with her high beams on, and getting multiple, multiple other people (friends of hers and people she meets at bars) to do the same. These are cars I recognize from when we were on good terms, not a paranoid delusion I made up. I filmed over 12 hours of her constant harassment and took many, many pictures (180 GB in total).\n\nI ended up in a psyche ward, twice actually (both times voluntary), but they could not help me, because I’m not schizophrenic, this is really happening.\n\nI was followed to work, every single day, and followed home by her and a convoy of cars and SUV’s that I’d recognize everywhere — I even started memorizing and writing down license plates.\n\nShe herself is 5’3”, 108 lb., not very intimidating, but she is a prolific liar and manipulator. I’m sure she’s made up horrible things about me to gain influence, plus she’s kind of hot very, very charismatic. Everyone who follows me is a man, since she cannot maintain friendships with other women. These are men who are desperate and want to sleep with her, trying to be the hero.\n\nI moved, there was a brief period of time (September to early December) where it stopped, but then she found out where I live, and it began again, this time increasing in hostility.\n\nI’ve called the police hundreds of times, I have an RFA against her (that she violates every day), the police never catch her. I’ve dealt with about 5-6 police departments, and I think they can’t stand me anymore. I don’t get taken seriously. I regret having a few angry outbursts with the police right around the time I submitted my evidence in, and they didn’t look at it or pull the security footage I told them to pull from a store my ex was in at the same time I was — I know because I called the store and they told me the police ever asked for the footage.\n\nI’ve felt like I’m going crazy, yes, I’ve questioned my sanity A LOT. My own other (who I just recently started talking to again) is horrified, doesn’t believe me, and think I should “seek help” — even though I already have, and a therapist and medication is not what I need, because I’m being tortured by actual people, it’s not a figment of my imagination.\n\nI lost my job two weeks ago due to the all-consuming paranoia, and my increasing sensitivity to being stalked and followed everywhere I go.\n\nI’m on a verge of a mental breakdown, I’ve worked with every service possible. My biggest fear is lashing out on one of the cars and being the wrong car, sending me to jail for a long time. I’ve had to show incredible restraint throughout this entire ordeal, because I keep hoping that THIS clip will nail her, or THIS license plate will be the one that gets her locked up etc.\n\nI know I’m right, I know I am, in my heart of hearts. The whole idea behind it is to get me to slip up and hurt the wrong person, or get institutionalized, or go to prison, or even kill myself. It’s constant, subtle, horrible harassment that is very, very hard to prove.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go into what they do if you want, but I’m also really scared that someone will see this and do it to someone else. It’s sadistic, and it’s the most fucking evil thing I’ve ever experienced. This is still ongoing, and it’s taking everything I’ve got to stay sane.\n\nThere’s people out there who claim they’re being followed by helicopters or that the government is tracking them or whatever — I DON’T THINK THAT. I’m not someone the government would even be interested. It’s my ex-girlfriend and people she manipulates. I know exactly how she does it, the only thing is I have no idea why she’s so dedicated to this, or how she’s got so many other people to be so invested in it with her.\n\nI’ve seen a few videos of other sane people on YouTube who are going through what I’m going through, which somewhat comforting, even though I feel horrible for them.\n\nIt’s called ‘organized stalking,’ or ‘community harassment.’ If you look up ‘gang stalking,’ you’ll just find a bunch of paranoid schizophrenics talking about microchips and helicopters, and people thinking they’re being followed by 100 police cars etc., which again, IS NOT ME.\n\nI don’t know why I’m posting this, I don’t even think anyone can help me. I just want people to know it’s a real thing, and it’s an absolute life-draining nightmare. If anyone out there has experienced this, please feel free to message me. There’s nothing where I live as far as support goes for this kind of thing, especially for men.\n\nI know I’m posting this on No Sleep, but I’m getting no sleep, and this is real, I’m not a writer and this is not fiction. It’s scary as fuck, there’s a lot of members here, and I just want to be heard.",

        "text": "This happened 14 years ago, and to this day i still consider my self lucky. The morning was cool as we loaded into the ambulance heading to a call at the edge of town. It was 6:12 am and it was still dark outside.\n\nWe were called in by the police station saying that there were multiple wounded at what seemed to be a farm. We didnt actually know what caused the injuries, but we made our way to the scene. \n\nThe address took us to a dirt road that lead us to a home that had 2 police cars outside with their lights on, but we didnt see any officers posted, there was no one there. The home was attatched to the farm that seemed to be either deserted or just really old, but my main focus was on the cop cars out front, typically when they were called to a scene there is at least a police officer guiding us to where we needed to go, but there was no one.\n\n A situation like this could be dangerous, we could be heading into danger and not know it. The homes front door was open but there werent any lights on, there seemed to be blood on the front porch that lead into the house. \n\nHading been in the field for 18 months, i was pretty hardened by multiple calls with car crashes and even a triple homicide, but something about call was different, for the first time being on call i was actually afraid, i decided that rather than just sitting around that we should enter the home and try to find the injured people. \n\nI slowly entered the home with a flashlight and a medical bag, the blood that was on the porch lead into the home and up the stairs, i made my presence known but i got no response, i tried the lights but they didnt work, what was this place?\n\n As i searched the bottom floor clues i started to hear muffled sounds coming from upstairs, it sounded like something very heavy, being dragged across the floor. The other paramedics that were now with me also heard the sounds upstairs but they also seemed to feel scared. \n\nWe heard the dragging sounds continue upstairs slowly moving to the top stairs, not thinking i began to walk to the stairs to see if there was anyone there, the blood on the stairs was thick and it made it slippery since the floors were made with wood.\n\n i shined my light to the top of the stairs having no idea what to expect, i slowly continued forward with the other paramedics behind me. \n\nWe were half way up the stairs when we saw a hand pull forward, a policeman who was on the ground, he continued to drag himself on the ground revealing that his lower half was missing. \"Get out of here before it sees you\" he said with extreme pain. \n\nMy medical training must have kicked in as i ignored his warning and i rushed to his aid at the top of the stairs. At the top of the stairs i could see what remained of the officer and the trail of blood that he produced that came to another set of stairs leading to what appeared to be the attic. \n\nThe 2 paramedics that were with me attended to the officer at the top of the stairs and i ventered slowly to the stairs of the attic.\n\n Above me i could hear sounds that im not able to describe, but they were terrifing in nature, sounds that i assumed to be grunts or something very large eating. My flashlight was the only thing illuminating my path in the long hallway leading to the attic stairs.\n\n The hallway was long and unfurnished, i could see scratches on some of the walls and floors although blood covered most of the floor. \n\nI had no idea what was happening here or more importantly what was still happening, but i assumed due to the blood and lack of personel at the scene that there were many that still required my help.\n\nIve experienced violence before while on duty, many people while in shock can be aggressive and numb to pain while making subduing them quite the task. I wasnt necessarily preparing for violence although its never outside the realm of possibility. \n\nI proceeded to the attic steps alone flashlight in hand, i was tempted to announce my presence but i decided against it, i had a feeling that i never experienced before. i walked up the stiars slowly hearing sounds much clearer, sounds that didnt sound good. \n\nI was about to reach the top of the stairs when i heard a loud sound coming from downstairs and a rushing of people entering the home. I quickly turned around and ran down the stairs over to the other paramedics and the officer that was in grave condition. \n\nComing up the stairs was a SWAT team in full gear. This wasn’t your average SWAT team, they looked like an FBI SWAT but none of them had the badge and carried grade weapons. \n\nWhen they reached the top They ordered us all downstairs and told us to leave the officer. The officer was bandaged but unresponsive due to blood loss. They asked me \"where is it\" sternly, as if they knew what they were about to face, and i pointed to the attic stairs.\n\nThey rushed the stairs leading to the attic with their weapons drawn and we went down the stairs. From the bottom floor we could hear screeching and gunfire coming from the attic, a lot of gunfire. \n\nWe were ushered outside by more members of the swat team, by this time the sun was starting to rise and not only did the swat team arrive, but also what seemed to be government officials in suits. They were completely void of emotion as if this was regular business Whilst clearly hearing the horror that was coming from the house.\n\nThey pulled us aside and asked us questions. They asked us what we saw and who was all inside, we hadnt seen much so we told them the truth.\n\n I asked them \"what was going on, what was inside\", they didnt answer me and they told me to attend the people that theyll be bringing out. \n\nThey brought out 7 bodies that day, 7 mangled bodies, none of them fully intact and from my understanding it seemed like they killed whatever was up there but I never got to see it.\n\nWhat happened here? What did they shoot in the attic? What was i about to see in the attic had the SWAT team not arrived? Im just glad that i was wasnt one of those bodies.",

        "text": "I was sick.   \nDiagnosed with a type of disease that not only would end up taking my life eventually, it also took most of my memories while I was still living. Every day I was waking up more confused, more scared, and then the moment of realization would hit.. I was really going to die.   \nIt was a nightmare I'd been experiencing daily, and it had taken its toll, I was exhausted both physically and mentally. And then of course, the hallucinations had started, seeming so tangible I could nearly reach out and touch them.. Almost.   \nThe doctors said it was a part of the disease, and there wasn't much they could do.   \nThey gave me pills to take, but they made me feel sicker than I already was, so I only took them every now and then, and seemed to welcome the hallucinations like an old friend. A bit, albeit scary at times, of twisted entertainment in my fucked up life.   \nI guess that's why mum had the idea to book the seaside escape, we both knew there wasn't much time left. Maybe she wanted me to make some good memories, instead of dwelling in the not real.   \n\"You loved the beach when you were little, claudy.\" she beamed at me when she handed me the brochure.   \nI thought back to 7, 8, 9 years old. Splashing in the ocean, not a care in the world. Life was so much easier back then, and I'd never even appreciated it at the time.   \nThe brochure showed a quaint little beach house, right on the waters edge. It looked beautiful. It looked peaceful.   \nI smiled as best I could manage through gritted teeth, the agony that my body felt was indescribable,  thanking my mother for her thoughtfulness and seeing her smile made that pain bearable, at least for a moment.   \nIt wasn't safe for me to drive, given the circumstances, not to mention that the hallucinations made it even more difficult to distinguish what was real and what wasn't. Not safe, that's why I had to take the bus.   \nMum had loaded me on, giving me the crochet blanket she'd worn over her own knees throughout my adolescence, as well as packing me a lunchbag of curried egg sandwiches, like she used to many years ago when I was a school boy.   \n\"Safe travels, my love. I'll see you soon, once I've finished up at work.\" she stood waving as the bus peeled off the sidewalk, and I watched out the window as she got smaller and smaller, until I couldn't see her anymore.   \nNausea prevented me from eating, so the sandwiches grew stale over the trip, I snuggled back into the seat, eyes closed, drifting in and out of sleep. I managed fine with sips of water here and there when I woke up, grateful for my headphones, drowning out any noise from the other passengers making it easy to rest.   \nA taxi driver was waiting for me when we arrived, standing in the bus depot, holding a sign with my name. He was old and grumpy looking, no trace of a smile on his face as he grunted back at my hello.   \nThe car ride was silent, not that I cared. I was enchanted by the scenery,the smell of the salty sea air. I closed my eyes and breathed in deeply, allowing my mind to travel back to my younger years, when escaping to the beach had a whole different meaning.   \nI settled in quickly to the beach house, dumping my backpack on the double bed and laying down beside it. Even though I'd napped on the bus just hours earlier, I needed another nap. I fumbled lazily for my pain medication, finding it entangled in a pair of underwear in my backpack. I'd never been much of an organised guy, but I was pretty proud Id managed to remember everything I needed. That's what it was all about, the doctors voice was bouncing around my head, You've gotta celebrate the small wins, Claud.   \nHe was right, but I wouldn't tell him. We had a kinda love hate relationship going on, and I didn't want to go soppy on him all of a sudden.   \nI could hear the waves rolling in as I began to drift off to sleep, a smile on my face, I felt the most relaxed I'd been in years.   \nWhen I woke, daylight had faded into night. The moon, full and blindingly bright, seeped through the flimsy sheer curtains, illumating the room in an eery yellow glow.   \nI felt around for my water bottle, sure I'd sat it on the night stand earlier, but it was no where to be seen. I was contemplating going back to sleep when I heard it. A shuffle, a scratch. It was silent again for a moment, and I began to think my hallucinations were visiting, but then I heard it again. It was louder, more frantic and it sounded as if it was coming from the front door.   \nA cat, perhaps, or maybe even a wild animal, a possum, lost and trying to find it's way in, looking for food or shelter.   \nI stood, slowly. I'd learnt that rushing up to do anything when I had been sitting or laying, often resulted in a trip to the hospital due to a fall from blacking out.   \nIt took what felt like an age, but I eventually made it to the door, hobbling painfully along like a man a lot older than I was.   \nThere was no cat or possum at the door, there was nothing there.   \nMy face flushed with exhaustion and indignation. I was definitely hearing things. I decided i was going to start talking the medication every day now, maybe I'd even call the doctor, get him to up my script a bit more.   \nMum was right. I needed to live in reality while I still could, even if it was more terrifying than any hallucination i had ever had.  \nThe next day I woke feeling energized, in a way I hadn't for a long time. I got up and dressed immediately, not even bothering to stop and brush my teeth, and I was out the door making my way down to the beach before I knew it.   \nIt was breathtaking, the cool air in my face, seeing the waves crash, hearing the seagulls cry. I wanted to stay in this moment, forever.   \nThat was until the screaming started.   \nIt was so loud and unexpected that my body jolted with the sound. Instinctively I put my hands up to my ears, covering them from the admonition that was that noise.   \nI glanced around the beach, the sea, the dunes behind me, to see where the sound was coming from, but I was totally alone.   \nI stumbled back to the beach house, grateful that there was no one else around, for I truly would have looked like a mad man. I was already thin, shockingly so, drained from my disease. I hadn't shaved or showeded in days. There seemed no point, not when I was going to be alone for a few days until mum arrived. I was dressed in ratty old track pants, much too big on my slim frame, I'd had to make a makeshift belt out of a scarf I found lying around. Now here I was, stumbling, hands covering my ears, my eyes darting back and forth like a deer in the head lights, I looked like the definition of crazy.  \nIn retrospect, I wasn't surprised to see the woman on the couch when I finally made it back into the house. I ignored her even, rushing straight in for the tap, which I took a long gulp of water from, stopping only to catch my breath.   \nThe woman remained on the couch, her expression neutral as she watched me with a sort of bored curiosity.   \n\"Aren't you even going to say hello?\" she seemed put off, a slight frown creasing her nose. \"or even ask why there's a stranger in your living room?.\"  \nI almost balked. Usually my hallucinations said odd, hurtful and down right scary things. They didn't normally interact as if they were having an every day conversation.   \nStill, my health was going down hill, there was no denying that. Maybe my hallucinations were just getting more realistic as i got worse.   \nI continued on ignoring her, or it, whatever it was as I heated a tin of soup for dinner. It wasn't much, but my appetite was basically non existant, so I begrudgingly tried to down as much disgusting mouthfuls as I could without the need to vomit.   \nI placed the bowl and spoon in the sink, turning the light off as I left the kitchen to go to the bedroom. Moments later, I'd not even made it halfway down the tiny corridor, there was a smash, the sound of glass shattering against tiles. I should of went back, but I was too scared. As soon as my head hit the pillow, The screaming began.  \nI didn't sleep, I couldn't. I tossed and turned fitfully, afraid of every shuffle and scratch that sounded at the front door, every shadow I saw under my own door. I kept waiting for the door knob to turn, but it never did. The screaming didn't stop for so, so long. I don't know how long exactly, my phone had gone flat and I wasn't game enough to get up and look for the charger, but the scream was still going when dawn broke.  \nI lay in bed, red eyed and drowsy, wondering if I should call the police. Or maybe a psychologist. Then as quickly as it had started, seemingly out of the blue, it just stopped. Abruptly, cut off mid scream. The house was quiet now, deathly quiet, until a knock pounded on the bedroom door.  \n\"It's mum. Open up, sweetie!\" the voice, in not my mums, voice said. \"I need to make sure my honeys okay. Now, open UP!\"  \nThe pounding began again immediately, this time the hammering on the door didn't stop for a while. I had the covers pulled up to my chest, shaking. The door was open. Whoever, whatever, the hell that was could of just opened the door up to come inside, but they didn't, they just kept pounding on the door.  \nAfter what felt like an eternity, and just like the screaming, the pounding stopped. I waited with baited breath, wondering what I was going to do. I needed the charger, I needed to call mum and tell her what was going on. She always knew the right things to say, to help me. But that meant braving whatever was on the other side of the door.  \nThe hallway was empty, no monsters to be seen. I tiptoed down to the lounge, which was empty as well. In the kitchen, the bowl I had used for last night's soup was smashed in pieces across the tiled floor. I grabbed the broom and swept up as much as I could while I put my phone on the charger and waited for the kettle to boil.  \nFirst, coffee  \nThen solve the crazy, if that was even possible.   \nMum never answered. I left a message, and then another. By the time three hours had passed, I was growing concerned. She always had her phone on, incase anything happened and I needed her.. And she always rang back, always.   \nI thought about her plans, trying to remember what she told me. It was hard, the strain so difficult I suddenly felt ill. I needed a nap, just a small little sleep and then..   \nShe was back. My eyes were closed, but I could feel her staring at me. Anger bubbled inside, I was so sick of this! I had enough on my plate, being sick, now being worried about mum.. I didn't need these hallucinations making anything harder than it already was. My eyes snapped open, and I looked up, pure hate radiating out of my stare.   \nIt was the girl that had been sitting on my couch the night before, the one who smashed my bowl. She was staring back at me just as intently, not breaking eye contact. She wasn't smiling, just that same neutral expression. I opened my mouth to speak, but it was a scream that came out. The same one I'd been hearing.   \nAnimalistic, inhumane.  \n\"What do you want?\" I roared, slamming both my hands down on the table top with a strength I didn't know I had left in me. \"Why are you doing this to me?\"   \n\"It's really not a question of what I want, or even why I'm doing this. If you must know, I'm actually trying to help you.\" she smiled now, and for all the resentment I felt towards her, even I had to admit it was beautiful.   \n\"I don't understand.\" my voice came out defeated, tired. \"I came here to relax and feel better and.. And now my mum is missing, she could be hurt and I'm sitting here wasting my time on a hallucination.\" I spat the last few words, bitterness rising once again in my chest. My eyes burned with hot, unshed tears, but I wouldn't let myself cry, I couldn't.  \n\"I'm not a hallucination. I might not be like you.. But I'm real.\" she leaned across the table and yanked on my shirt, pulling me forward, then with a satisfied smirk, she held up her arms in a 'see' expression. \"And also, your mum isn't missing.\" the girl let out an uncomfortable sigh. \"I really hate this part.. It never gets easier.\"  \nI wanted to ask her what she meant exactly and what the hell was going on, but she continued on before I had the chance,  \n\"Remember back, Claude. Remember back to when you first even heard about this place? I know you belive your mum booked it, but she didn't. It was suggested to you by one of the drug therapists you have seen. There had been others, others who had come here to get clean and rejuvenate. It is a beautiful place, after all.\"  \nI frowned at what she was saying, not knowing whether to burst into laughter, or get as far away from her as possible. She was clearly insane.   \n\"Okaaay. Look, I don't know who put you up to this. I'd belive some of it, if I'm being honest but for one, I'm not any addict. And I didn't book this house myself, mum organised it all, down to my sandwiches.\" now it was my turn for the triumphant smirk, but the girl didn't smile, she looked sad.   \n\" Sometimes it's harder with others.\" she seems to be saying to herself. And to me, she smiles, her face a tad disappointed .\" I'm really sorry you can't remember. And that I'm the one that has to do this. Claude, your mum isn't missing because she isn't alive anymore. She hasn't been alive for a long time now.\" the girl holds my hand in hers as she leads me to my backpack, where embarrassingly I've left the sandwiches I couldn't stomach to eat on the bus in. The brown paper bag is empty. It has no crumbs. But it doesn't mean anything, or course. I could of easily ate the sandwich and forgotten all about it.  \n\"It's not your memory playing tricks,\" she says, as if she can read my mind. \"There were no sandwiches to begin with. Your mother is not alive, she couldn't have made them. Try and remember back, her funeral? You were in quite a state, fueled mainly by pills but not the pain type. Not back then. Remember how your brother made everyone laugh with happy tears at the eulogy he wrote? It was beautiful and described your mother perfectly.\"  \nMy head aches, I can see a casket. I can remember crying. I see Henry, my younger brother, up on the stage, wiping tears from his eyes.   \n\" No.\" I say.   \nNow it's her turn to scream, and it smashes every window in the house. She rises in form, larger than life. Her eyes once Grey, flash red. \"YOU NEED TO WAKE UP!\" the foundation of the beach house waves, threatening to crumble under her bellowing voice.   \n\"No.\" I say again, because I can't. It doesn't matter what is true, I can't go back. I can't remember. Anything is better. Even this.   \nI feel it all at once, a burning sensation that rips through every Fibre in my being. I see flashes, memories of a past i had left behind. A stormy night, arguing as rain pressed up against the windshield. The sound of metal on metal. The wrongness of being upside down in the air, spinning out of control. I saw myself, and I was instantly sorry, I remembered it. But it didn't change a thing.   \nThe pain was radiating through my body now, I wanted to beg her to stop whatever she was doing, let me go, but I couldn't speak. She glared down at me from where she had me gripped in her oversized palm. \"REMEMBER!\" she commanded, and I did.   \nI am at a doctors office, crying. My hands are shaking, my body in a pain I never knew existed. I was begging for more pills, and the doctor was looking down at me with disdain.   \n\"The accident was a year ago, Claude. Everything had healed, nicely. There is no reason you should be experiencing any pain.\"  \nI saw red, I screamed, picking his desk up and tumbling it over. \"I'm in pain!!\" I yelled, over and over until security came and escorted me out.  \nI see myself sleeping on my brother's couch. I see him and his wife arguing, while I hide in the hallway. She's crying, accusing me of stealing money out of her purse. My brother defends me, weakly, but still.   \nThe next day I empty their medicine cabinets as well as the safe in my brother's office  \n It took me a moment to register it was coming from me.   \nI get three grand, and mums wedding ring.  \nI sell the ring before the evening is over.  \nI am vomiting now, snot and vomit run down my chin and soak my shirt. I'm crying. I don't want to remember. I can't.  \n\"Keep. Going.\" her voice has lost its anger. Perhaps she senses that my will to fight has vanished. She is calmer. But she doesn't let me out of her grip.  \nI'm out of my mind on pills,on grief. I steal a car, and I drive out of town. Stop Claude, I can hear my mother's voice then, but the pains too much. I see a tree. And I put my foot down.  \nThe girl has placed me down. She sits next to me, back to her normal human size. She pats my leg like I'm a dog and I think that's her way of trying to comfort me.  \n\"I died? And this is.. Hell? Purgatory for what I've done, how I treated my family? It is what I deserve.\" I want to be shocked but I can't. Now I can remember, I can understand the why.  \n\"You didn't die. This is real. You booked the beach house, the bus trip, the grumpy taxi. All that's real. What's not real, you seeing your mum, hearing her banging on your door here. The screaming you heard when you've been alone. The hallucinations you see. Our minds have a funny way of working, trying to protect us from things that hurt us. Your mind was giving you monsters, a serious and deadly disease tnat was a life sentance, to make sense of everything you felt and experienced.\"  \nI opened my mouth but nothing came out. It was true, all of it. I remember sitting in the car outside the hospital, but I never went in. I never had an appointment.  \n\" after your surgery, after the accident\"  \n she does quotations, \"I was sent to hang around and keep an eye on you. See how it played out. They didn't think you'd recover, let's put it that way.\" she smiled now, but it wasnt an overly happy one.  \n\"I'm scared.\"  \n\"im not going to hurt you. I'm here to help. Remember? Now it's all up to you what happens next. I've got everything here.\" she guestues to a bag at her side and I see it's filled with white pill bottles. \"there's two options. 1,you take all the pills. It's what you wanna do. You take all the pills and all the pain is gone forever. Or 2. You don't.\"  \nI wait for her to go on, but she doesn't.  \n\"And if I don't? I mean, I can just choose not to?\"  \nShe rolls her eyes, looking irritated. \"Well duh. Everything is a choice, isn't it? I'm just telling you your options, Clause.   \nYou can take the pills and forget it all. Or you can not take the pills. You Can follow through with your withdrawal, you might even be able to end up in some dead end shitty job, barely earning enough to get by. You probably wouldn't be able to afford therapy, so you'd have to try really hard to stay clean. It sounds hard. But, like I said, it's your choice. So, what's it going to be?\"   \nI hasn't golf anyone about her, not til now. I was scared no one would belive me, hell I barely believed myself some days but then I would glance down at my wrist, see the scar and know i wasn't insane.   \nInfact, I was now 8 months clean. I was fit, physically and mentally. And yes. I had my dead end grocery store job, and I loved it.   \nBut anyway back to what's important, when I was packing up after tonight's DA meetings, one of the new guys came up to me. He'd been to one meeting the week before, and I remembered to congratulate him on his achievement. It was one thing to come to one meeting, but to come to two In a row, this guy was committed.  \n\"I'm Dave.\" he extended a hand, glancing down at mine as we shook. \"Nice scar. I noticed it last week, but didn't want to pry. I've, uh, I've got the same one.\" he pulled his sleeve up to reveal one that matched mine to a mirror imagine.  \nI didn't know what to say, I just stared at him open mouthed. I wanted to ask him what he knew, what that thing that changed our lives was, but then I realized it didn't matter anymore. The past was done. I had a dinner date with my brother and his wife in 30 minutes, that's all that mattered.   \n\"I'll see you next week.\" Dave smiled and waved as he left, and I waved back, smiling too because I knew he would be back next week, and the week after that. We had made our choice and we both beared the scars to prove it.",

        "author": "Agent_Blackfyre",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ov359/theater_story_i_stole_link_in_comments/",
        "text": "After working as a janitor (at a *haunted-as-fuck* movie theater of all places - but that’s another story) the absolute *worst* part (aside from disembodied voices calling your name, seeing things out of the corner of your eye, etc) was cleaning the women’s bathrooms.\n\nSorry ladies, but you’re goddamn animals when youre alone in a bathroom stall.\n\nAnd those sanitary boxes? *jesus. Goddamn. FUCK*.\n\nI am desensitized to *a lot* after scrubbing those toilets and wiping down those bathrooms\n\n**edit**\n\nBecause I should elaborate on the theater, this is from an earlier post when I addressed this:\n\nWhen I graduated college, I moved back home and got the job as a morning cleaner at the local movie theater (shift 4AM - 10 AM) The guy who interviewed me was a scruffy guy named Jeff. I remember he asked me the typical questions, if I was OK with working weird hours, cleaning up vomit, etc. What struck me as odd was the last question he asked; “do you scare easy?” I kinda laughed and said no.\n\nThe job was pretty easy, all things considered; throw this away. Mop that. Scrub this. Take out the garbage. You’re by yourself for a majority of the shift, so we were allowed to bring our iPods with us. The theater was large, its layout was shaped like a T, with the lobby and bathrooms in the stem, the smaller theaters on the left and the larger, IMAX screens on the right. Running above the theater hallway was the projection area, an equally long hallway with a couple of small offices and all the projector equipment. If you were the first to arrive in the morning, you had to go up a winding staircase and turn on the lights in all the theaters. It wasn’t a big deal, except with all the lights off, the building can be as Jeff once described, ‘a little creepy’. The projector area was full of promotional materials, including a sea of cardboard cutouts from all the movies that have played in the theater. Sometimes the theater manager would have giveaways and the staff could take home some of the items. Pretty cool, but when the lights were off, it looked like a sea of people in the hallway. Another part of our job was to meet with the day manager, who looked a little flustered when he explained to me that women were complaining about a tall, lanky man in a suit that had been following them from theater to theater, sometimes into the bathroom. \n\nThe last several months, several had come to the front desk, describing a 7-foot tall man in a black suit, complete with bowler cap, walking slowly after them. A few times even the police were called. Teenagers that worked the day shift referred to him as \"The Tall Man\".\n\nWe had 12 theater rooms total, but theater 5 was the worst. Nobody wanted to clean it out. When I first started, I was fairly naive about what was going on, and I didn't understand why Jeff was apprehensive about Theater 5 and kept assigning me to clean it out. What made Theater 5 unique was that it sat behind the bathrooms in the lobby, so to get to the sitting area you had to walk down a long hallway before reaching the screening room. Being that far back you were the most secluded, especially when it's 4AM and the only other people you're with are on the other side of the building. People cleaning there would complain of nosebleeds, constant headaches, and a feeling of being watched. Theater 5 always gave me an uneasy feeling, like I was being watched. One day, I was sweeping out garbage from under the seats when I hear footsteps. Someone running. I look down at the front of the theater, and I catch glimpse of a little blonde-haired boy turning the corner into the long hallway. Immediately, I threw down my broom and chased after him. I ran down the hallway and out into the lobby, where the kid had disappeared. I walked further into the lobby and saw Jeff outside the front entrance, smoking.\n\n\"Who was that kid?\" I asked. Jeff looked at me, for a moment he was confused, and laughed. \"So you met Charlie?\" Charlie was another entity customers complained about. On several occasions, they claimed a little blonde haired boy was running up and down the aisles in the theater, causing all kinds of noise and ruckus during the movie. Of course, it was in theater 5. When an usher would come to apprehend the child, he’d be gone. The female staff affectionally named him, \"Charlie\", after his resemblance to the character in Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. Charlie was also responsible for knocking several cans of garbage over, misplacing things, making our janitorial duties a pain in the ass. We used to theorize that he was the son of The Tall Man, but the two were never seen together. It took that experience for Jeff to admit that “some people have seen and heard some things”, which was his way of saying the theater was haunted. I found it odd, considering the theater was relatively new…it was built in the 90s, on some wet lands. According to some people that lived in the area, the property was owned by a family who sold it off back in the 1980s. There was no evidence of foul-play, it wasn’t an indian burial ground. It was just a weird place where strange things happened.\n\nI got more, but Reddit mobile is being really weird and not letting me post more. 🙄\n\n**edit**\n\nBecause I’ve been asked to elaborate further, and (one of the events) what finally drove me to quit:\n\nThe theater basement was used for storage. I’d give a better description but that’s as much as I know, I never went down there. I remember that Jeff gave me a couple of bags and told me to drop them off in the basement. I said I didn’t know where that was. He pointed down the hall. “Last door on the left,\" he replied. I started walking and he stopped me. “Don’t go down there by yourself,” he added. “There’s a lot of shit down there and I don’t want you tripping over anything.”\n\nThis morning it was Jeff, myself, and a co-worker named Trevor. Trevor was on the other side of the building cleaning out a theater. I could hear his leaf-blower running (we use them to blow popcorn out of the theaters) I didn’t want to bother walking across the building to grab him. Jeff walks out of the lobby to have a smoke. I’m by myself at the far end of a dark hallway. I open the door and I’m looking at a long staircase that drops into darkness. I flip the light switch to my left. There's only a flickering light at the bottom step. Nobody ever went down there to fix it.\n\nI heard a door open from the lobby. Jeff hadn’t returned, I’m just hearing things. I look back down the staircase. I’m about to descend when I hear a voice from the bottom of the steps. “Hey!” It’s a low, raspy voice. I pause. “Hey, c’mere!” it says again. There’s a shadow bleeding in from the bottom of the staircase. I can’t tell what it is, but it’s definitely a person. “Hello?” I call down. I don’t know why I did, I know that I’m the only person on this side of the building. I know that there isn’t just some person hiding out in a dark basement. At this point my heart is pounding and I’m starting to sweat, because I know this isn’t normal and I’m experiencing something that shouldn’t be happening.\n\n“you gotta to see this! come here and look!” it says again. The voice is a little louder.\n\nIt sounds like someone with a cold. The shadow is bleeding further into the bottom of the steps. Whatever’s down there is coming closer. I toss the bags down to the bottom of the steps, turn off the light and walk back down to the lobby. Jeff is walking back inside. I tell him about what happened. He almost looks irritated when I tell him I was going to go by myself. “Nothing here is going to hurt you,” he said finally. I will never not be shocked at how casual he was about this whole thing. Later on, I told Trevor about what had happened. We went back to the steps to investigate, and when I turned on the flickering light, the bags I had thrown were gone.",

        "text": "I went deaf during an experiment. Happened during a sound test, the damn speakers blew my eardrums and I was in pain for an hour or so. The doctors said that they couldn't fix the eardrums, so I'm permanently deaf.\n\nI live in a medium-sized house, near a hospital, since I figured if I get injured or something it's easy to get help. There are only about 7 other houses, with 9 neighbors. I got to know about 8 of them, since one of them is a senile old man who speaks German but doesn't use sign language.\n\nThe voices appeared around a week ago, while I was at home, reading a book about how to get used to being deaf. I was on page 56 I think, then a quiet, incoherent whisper. It startled me, but as I looked around, there was nothing to be found. I shrugged it off as my imagination. 15 minutes later. Another whisper, this time in what was presumably 1800s English. It was a bit quiet, but all I could make out was; \"Thou shalt...\", and then after that it was mumbled. I tried it shrug it off, but they kept whispering into my ears.\n\n\nAt first, it was, what? 1-3 voices at a time, whispering? But after 4 or 5 days, it kept getting worse and worse, louder and louder. I can't get them out of my head, and they overlap each other, so I can't make out anything they say. I tried going to the doctors, and they recommended me to go to a mental health institute. I tried a spiritual helper, and they said some bullsh#t crap like; \"The spirits are angry with you, and are speaking to you all at once to tell them their unfinished deeds\". On day 6, while I was riding in a taxi going home, one of the voices yelled for the first time. I closed my ears thinking the voices would stop. It. Would. Not. Stop. I prayed to GOD that the voices would just STOP. The taxi driver kept shaking me, trying to ask if I was okay. After 3 full minutes of yelling in my ears, I finally jumped out of the cab, trying to end my life by jumping out onto oncoming traffic. Turns out I was already at home. So I rushed inside, picked up a knife, and tried to end it, a jugular pierce. A deafening, painful shriek came and stopped me. I don't know how, but the scream hurt my eardrums, even though they were ruptured. The screams wouldn't stop until I put down the knife. The voices returned to the mumbling. I tried to sleep after that, but sleep wouldn't come. 3 hours of non-stop voices. I couldn't even hear anything they were making out.\n\nToday, only one voice was there. It was mumbling at first, but now it's full blown yelling at the top of their lungs, if they had any. This time, it was a demonic voice, a deep f#ck!ng voice. It repeated the same phrase, over. And. Over. And. Over again. It was just saying a latin phrase, \"In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti\". At 7pm, it started to multiply. I can't get them to stop, so someone, anyone who reads this post, please, help me.",

        "text": "It was just another night shift at the remote observatory, until the astronomer noticed something strange in the telescope's view. At first, he thought it was just a glitch in the equipment, but as he kept observing, he realized that it was actually a group of glowing objects moving in formation. Excited and skeptical, he immediately contacted his colleague to confirm the sighting.\n\nAs they continued to watch the unidentified objects, they soon noticed that they were not just any ordinary celestial bodies, but they were actually spaceships. The astronomers were in disbelief and fear, but their curiosity got the best of them and they decided to take a closer look. They quickly grabbed their cameras and headed outside to get a better view.\n\nIt was then that the astronomers witnessed something truly remarkable, the spaceships were landing on the ground, and out of them stepped creatures that were not from this world. They were aliens, tall and slender beings with large black eyes and gray skin. The astronomers stood frozen, not knowing what to do.\n\nBut, the aliens seemed to be peaceful and they approached the astronomers, communicating telepathically and telling them that they have been watching our planet for a long time and have finally decided to make contact. The aliens explained that they were from a planet far away and that their civilization was facing extinction due to a catastrophic event. They asked for our help and said that they have chosen our planet as a safe haven for their kind.\n\nThe astronomers were stunned, and after a long discussion, they agreed to help the aliens and keep their presence a secret. They spent the next few weeks working closely with the aliens, who shared their advanced technology and knowledge with the humans.\n\nHowever, the peace was short-lived as the news of the alien's presence soon leaked out and created panic among the public. The government was quick to respond and formed a task force to investigate the aliens. The astronomers, along with the aliens, had to flee and go into hiding to avoid capture.\n\nAs they traveled from place to place, they encountered several close encounters with the task force and had to use all their wit and the alien's technology to escape. The aliens' true intention was now in question, and the astronomers started to doubt if they made the right decision to help them.\n\nIn the end, the astronomers discovered the truth about the aliens' mission and the reason for their arrival on Earth. It turned out that the aliens were not just seeking refuge, but they also had a hidden agenda. They needed to use the Earth as a power source to save their dying planet and ensure the survival of their species.\n\nThe astronomers had to make a tough decision, whether to sacrifice their planet for the aliens or let their civilization face extinction. In the end, they chose to help the aliens, but on one condition - that they would leave as soon as their mission was complete and not harm the Earth in any way.\n\nThe aliens kept their promise and left, and the astronomers were hailed as heroes for saving the planet. But, they knew that they would never forget the strange and incredible journey that they had taken with the night visitors.\n\nThe end.",

        "text": "I know what you must be thinking. What a horrible fucking person. I know. I've thought it too. The fact I'm genuinely thinking about shooting my dog makes me feel guilty. Then I remember what he's been doing, and my guilt is replaced with fear.\n\nThis started about a month ago now. I came home early from work one day absolutely furious and clutching a parting gift from my boss. My Christmas bonus was a fucking ham or something. I sighed with a hand pressed firmly against my throbbing temple and placed the mystery meat in the fridge. The pounding behind my eyes got more and more intense until I leveled my fist and punched the fridge hard.\n\nThe throbbing in my head did not go away yet had a new guest as it was now accompanied by an aching pain in my knuckles. I let out a deep sigh, that was childish. It was at that moment Rufus came padding in, his big brown eyes gazing up at me, quizzical as to what the noise had been. \"Your Dad was pretty dumb just know.\" I said crouching down to run my hands through his thick fur. He wagged his tail and let out an excited noise as I pet him. I raised my eyebrows, \"I wish I could just... Curl up in a ball and chill like you do.\"\n\nRufus of course paid no mind to this and after realizing he wouldn't be receiving more pets padded away back to his comfortable bed. I rolled my eyes and took a deep breath. While disappointing this whole Christmas bonus thing wasn't the end of the world. Sure my Boss was an evil prick, but I had a whole two weeks of paid vacation stored up and he couldn't stop me from using them. So fuck him. I'm going to relax and spend my vacation doing fuck all. \"How bout it Rufus? Wanna do Fuck all?\" I asked loudly. Rufus simply yawned.\n\nIt was the next morning that I discovered that the mystery meat was still in my fridge. I peeled back the wrapped paper to see a red mass bundled in saran wrap. I furrowed my brow. \"Gotta be beef.\" Rufus sat at my side eagerly awaiting something. \"I'm not a butcher how should I know what this is? I'll just.... Fry it. Everything tastes good fried with onions.\" I leaned down and booped Rufus's snout. \"I bet even YOU would taste good fried with onions.\" He agreed as his tail wagged back and forth wildly. \"Well don't you have a high opinion of yourself.\"\n\nI cut off a large chunk and threw it in a pan with onion, salt, pepper, and Butter. \"I hope you taste good Christmas Bonus because you don't fucking look good. I talk to myself to much. Having a full on conversation is probably not healthy.\" I raised my eyebrow and decided to turn on the TV for my own sanity. It blinked on to the cooking channel. I glared at the TV, \"Don't shame me.\" I then flipped to the news and got right back to frying my beef. \n\n\"Thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and families of the lates-\" I looked down at the large mass of beef left over \"Hey Rufus,\" I picked up a raw slab. \"Want something to chew on?\" He dashed on over like any dog would when presented with a hunk of beef. \"Okay you want it? Sit.\" I commanded with my most authoritative voice. Rufus giving no fucks lunged upwards and snagged it from my hand. \"Hey fucker!\" I said laughing, \"That was rude!\" Rufus took one last look at me before tearing into the beef with vigor. Still chuckling to myself I once again tuned into the news. \n\n\"The search is still on for Maya Kelling a local who was reported missing on December 14th by her boyfriend. She was in the Bellevue area and anyone with information is encouraged to call this numb-\" I shut it off. \"The news is depressing as fuck huh?\" Rufus paid me no mind as he continued munching away with that playful ferocity of a domesticated animal. \n\nI took a deep breath to try and smell my beef and it smelled God awful. \"Jesus,\" I said while furrowing my brow. \"What did I do to this thing?\" There was something deeply off-putting about that smell. It didn't smell rotten or decayed. It smelt... Foreign. It filled me with apprehension and a strange sense of dread. I shook my head and felt a wave of stupidity roll over me. The feeling was not to disimilar to when you're watching scary ass YouTube videos at night by yourself and you want to turn the lights on. \n\nI felt like a bitch. But the feeling of nervousness and the fact that no one but me would judge me for throwing all this meat out made my decision easy. This was going straight to the garbage. I threw it in and did my utmost to forget about it. \"Takeout it is.\"\n\nHaving stuffed myself silly with pizza I crashed hard. I'm a heavy sleeper so it takes a lot to wake me up. Yet, I was woken up. A loud crash echoed around my bedroom as I shot bolt upright and listened for a moment. I heard dragging noises. My heart pounding in my chest, I stood. Having armed myself with my pistol I took a couple careful steps Forward. The noise became more distinguished. There was a gnawing and eager snort. A sense of dread filled me as I rounded the corner expecting the worst.\n\n\"RUFUS!\" I shouted seeing an absolutely devastating mess. He had torn open the trash and it was scattered everywhere. I groaned and slumped my shoulders. \"Not only did you scare the shit out of me, I'm also going to have to clean up your fucking mess! C'mon man.\" Rufus having pillaged what he was looking for scampered off without even looking at me.\n\nHaving fully cleaned up the mess I stood up and stretched, cracking my back in a few places. \"You're an asshole for that.\" I said as I washed my hands. \"I'm going back to bed. Goodnight asshole.... Love you.\" I trailed off. Rufus was sitting on his bed gnawing on something. \"Hey what do you have?\" I walked forward and reached down and to my great surprise and for the first time I was greeted by a low growl. \"Hey,\" I said my word barely making it out of my throat because of the immediate surprise and fear. \n\nI took a few steps back and knelt down to get a good view of what he was gnawing at. They mystery meat. I reached forward tentatively to get met with the same low growl as before. \"Rufus, hey c'mon. Give me that, I think it's foul.\" What Rufus did next sent an icy chill down my spine. He simply stopped gnawing on it and stared me dead in the eyes. No more movement. No wagging tail. Nothing. I must have sat there for 30 seconds before I did anything. I stood up and forcing myself to turn around despite every single fiber of my being telling me not to take my eyes off him said \"Fine have it your way asshole.\" I couldn't help but take a peek over my shoulder as I walked away. He sat motionless, his eyes still locked on mine. \n\nI turned on my light, closed my door, and laid in bed until my eyes got to heavy to keep open.\n\nAfter waking up it took a few seconds to recollect the night before. When I did in full I opened my door tentatively to reveal Rufus curled up in a ball on his dogbed fast asleep. I felt a weary tension within me wither away. \"I need to get out of the house.\" I muttered.\n\nI came home that night to a dark abode. Having been drinking my bearings were slight askew and I found myself fumbling with my keys a bit. As I pushed open the door to my home I was greeted by that unfriendly darkness that settles over an empty house. I pawed for the light switch for a moment until I found it flipping it with one hand. \n\n\"FUCK!\" I cried in fear as my gaze was met my a great black mass standing in the middle of my living room. It wobbled slightly as if unsure of it's footing before it fell to all fours. \"Rufus!\" I cried, my heart playing my ripcage like the bongos. \"What the fuck was that you creepy ass mutt?\" Rufus just stared, tail stationary, eyes fixated on me. \"I... I'm gonna go relax now. You cut it the fuck out.\"\n\nRufus did not blink. Nor did I. I slammed my door closed and sat at the edge of my bed taken aback. \"Jesus. That was fucking scary.\" I said to myself as I took off my shoes. That image of a shadow in the dark, form stretched in a way it wasn't supposed to, was making my skin crawl. I've seen dogs stand up before. But in that goofy cute way. Hell I've even seen dogs do handstands, but this? Standing in the middle of the room in the dark just staring at the door? It unsettled me to my core.\n\nMy sleep was troubled, as if I had a nightmare I couldn't quite remember. I woke up to that feeling of unease creeping it's way back up my spine. To stall I scrolled through the news but nothing could take my mind off it. Not Bitcoin plunging in value, not the disappearance of that local girl, not Taco Bell bringing back the Nacho Fries. I just kept imagining what Rufus must be doing at the given moment. Standing there. Just standing there. I growled and punched my pillow. \"I'm acting like a pussy. Get up.\" \n\nI rolled out of bed and crept to my door, heart pounding. I stared at the handle and reached my hand out slowly, my heart began thudding within my chest at an increased tempo with a deep breath that caught in my chest I eased the door open.\n\nI felt fear jolt through my body as I saw him. Standing once again in the middle of the living room, his furry back to me as he stood absolutely motionless staring at the wall. My words caught in my throat I could not speak. I did the worst possible thing I could have possibly done and quietly closed my bedroom door. The fear began to set in worse. I locked my door and collapsed on my bed breathing fast.\n\nHe was out there. Standing up right. I couldn't open that door again. I couldn't make it out of the house. Not with him there. Not with him just standing there. I found myself nauseous from the terror that had possessed my body. I sat there staring at my door for the better part of the hour before finally getting up the courage to once again check outside my door. \n\nI crept slowly. Each footfall on the soft carpet surely giving me away to the keen ears of Rufus. My heart pounded in near apathetic terror as I once again laid my hand on the knob. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to open that door. Once it did I peered through the crack to try and see where he might be. \n\nStill. Standing. Trying my best to summon fury I opened the door wide and shouted \"RUFUS!\" All of the anger I summoned was turned into terrorized vapor when Rufus simply turned his head to face me. He turned his body next. He took a step. He took another step. One more step. I screamed in horror as he began marching towards me one odd, off keelter step at a time. I once more slammed the door and locked it and scrambled backwards in panic.\n\nI didn't hear a sound at my door. But I see the shadow of something standing out there. \"R-rufus!\" I yell. \"Stop it. Stop it right now!\" I was not met with silence again. I was met with a terrible sound. It sounded like when a dog yawns and their voice stretches and bends, but this had... Purpose. This wasn't just noises. It was measured. It was meaningful. \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE.\" I screamed in terror as it continued. \"LEAVE!\" I cried. \n\nThe sound stopped. The Shadow at my door then slowly and clumsily plodded away. I shook, my breath coming in gasps. I stayed awake and in my room for the rest of the day until finally thirst gripped me and I could not bear it any longer. I left the room armed with the small pistol I kept for safety. There he was. Curled up in his dogbed. Fast asleep. I kept my eyes locked on him as I tiptoed around gathering food and water before dashing to my room.\n\nI type this now to you to ask a community of people who deal with these things. If I call the cops they'll call animal control. They will either laugh in my face or simply take Rufus. I don't want that. I just want MY Rufus back. My good boy. What's happening to him? Why is he like this?",

It was May and the fields that stretched endlessly along the side of the road were bursting into vibrant green. Illinois is soybean land, and on a clear day you can see for miles and miles. The sight is boring to some, God knows it used to bore the hell out of me, but now on entering my thirty-fifth year I find it invigorating. Freeing. Perhaps it’s the result of seventeen years of claustrophobic city-living, five in Chicago and the rest in New York. \n\n\n\nI had almost forgotten what the horizon looked like, and now I could see nothing else. It assaulted me. The horizon was all that there was, now that the farmers had finally cleared away the last of those pesky trees. They had to make room for more farmland. But what about the deer? They were swarming the roads. I had already passed one exploded buck since I’d crossed the Mississippi. It had no antlers. Sawn off by some redneck for trophy, probably. Unsportsmanlike if you ask me. \n\nBut that sky. You couldn’t deny that sky. It was high blue and just everywhere. It took up four-fifths of the world out here and stood totally blank, except for the softest of white brushstrokes, and those could only be seen if you stopped the car and looked straight up. \n\nI switched to the right lane and slowed down to forty-five. I was looking for the billboard I knew must be coming up soon. It was also blue, but a fading royal blue, with a picture of a ridiculously tall meringue pie hand-painted across the surface. On top of the billboard, I remembered, was a plywood extension built just for the ruby red cherry on top. Across the bottom was written: THELMA’S FAMOUS MILE-HIGH PIES, EXIT 52, 1 MILE. \n\nOnce, and only once, my father had taken me to there to try Thelma’s famous Mile-High after many years of begging. I had the idea I might stop at the old sprawling restaurant, a relic even in ‘**`XX`**. It might still be there. Hell, I might even see Thelma herself. She wasn’t that old back then, forties maybe. She might still be alive. She might still be able to pull a pie out of the oven and toast the meringue. Hell, my great-grandmother baked into her nineties. She even put her pies on the windowsill to cool, even though we all told her it was ridiculous.\n\n*You were twelve the last time you were here. Don’t be disappointed if it’s gone. Things change. People die.* \n\nBut here it was, the big blue billboard was just starting to surface over the curve of the horizon. It was there, faded sure, more than faded, it was— \n\n“Motherfucker!” I cried. \n\nThe billboard wasn’t faded. It was gone. All that was left of Thelma’s Mile High Pies was a square skeleton of pipe and framing. The blue I had seen was the just sky peeking out between the board’s rusted steel ribcage. \n\nNo, that wasn’t all. In the middle of the frame, ridiculously small, hung a plain white banner. Slapped across it in red was a single word: \n\n\n##REPENT!\n\n\nI shot past the sign shaking my head. My good spirits had been crushed like a boot stomping out the glowing embers of a fire. What was I doing, coming back to the town where I had lived as a boy, trying to catch something that was irrevocably lost? What could I possibly gain by walking the bricked (probably asphalted now) downtown streets, or going to the (probably long-closed) soda fountain, which seemed impossibly kitsch even then. What could be waiting for me at the end of this road besides a hundred different kinds of humdrum disappointment? \n\nA flash of yellow caught my eye off to the left, and when I looked that way I felt a blast of pleasure and recognition. A large hill towered far across a plowed-flat field— the prehistoric consequence of a passing glacier, or maybe a yet-undiscovered Indian burial mound (there were lots in the area)— and right at its peak stood a familiar sunflower yellow barn. It was there then and it was here now, just as bright, probably re-painted by its owner every year. It looked exactly the same. \n\n“Shitcan eyesore!” I exclaimed with a grin, repeating my father’s long-ago slogan.\n\nThen an overpass blotted it out. I looked for it in the rear view, knowing it wouldn’t reappear. Maybe it was going to be all right after all. \n\nI dropped my eyes to the road, pushing the accelerator as I did. I watched for the sign. Presently it came up and out of the distance, shimmering in metallic green.\n\nVANDALIA\n\n5 MILES\n\nThe exit came up on the right, and for a moment I considered blowing right past it. I could stay on I-70 all the way to Effingham. A quick left would put me on 57. In two hours I would be hungry and I could stop for lunch in Champaign. I could drink in the college life, possibly flirt with a bored sorority girl or two. It wasn’t impossible. I’m still relatively trim and hell, dad bods are considered sexy now, right? After that I could head on to Chicago, with their overcrowded bars and irritatingly affordable apartments. It would be warm there. I could sunbathe at Montrose Beach, talk to some curiously friendly city folks, get invited to a house party, maybe hear about a place, a cute little one-bedroom in Lakeview, I could rent it, find a job that sends me a paycheck just before the money runs out…\n\nI signaled, slowed the Enterprise rental, and went up the ramp. Toward the top, where a stoplight paused the traffic trying to enter US-51, I glanced down at my watch. \n\nIt had stopped. \n\n\n***\n\n\nI skirted town, taking Amblin Way to Rural Route 3, heading to the site of the old Wal-Mart. It had stood next to the interstate for two decades, alone except for a dirty Burger King a half-mile away. It was finally torn down a few years ago. Damaged in a tornado, they say. \n\nMy mind wanted to speak up, but I would not let it. *Not yet. Please, not yet.*\n\nI was amazed by just how little things had changed out here. The road still curved down and around a hill and deposited my car on an insanely flat and straight road that, like an idiot child’s drawing, seemed to stretch on to infinity. On the right was still a vista of empty countryside. Its only feature besides brown dirt was a sign placed every mile or so that proclaimed, desperately, LAND FOR SALE. \n\nI turned left at Jefferson Street and after a short drive I saw it. I pulled over and got out of the car.\n\nThe grass grew wild and tall around the lot, obscuring the concrete parking stops that lined its perimeter. Buzzing cicadas droned in it, and I could see little green grasshoppers jumping back and forth in great confused arcs. \n\nThe lot itself was tar-black. Faded parking lines wobbled crazily from the hot air rising off the asphalt. In the middle of the lot, about the size and shape of a New York City block, stood the empty grey foundation of what had once been the Vandalia Wal-Mart. Any sense of identity had been stripped away from it. The demolition team had taken the building, and years of rainstorms and heavy snow had washed off any marker that might have been left. \n\nI felt a strong urge to walk over that hot blacktop, climb up the haphazard, cracking foundation, and retrace my old shopping route through the store. Here to the right were the rows and rows of empty shopping carts, and on past them was the grocery section. Then there was Seasonal Candy, and to the right of that were the clothes (no need to go that way) and ahead stood Homewares. If you hurried through there, then took a left at Greeting Cards, you would find yourself in Toys. That was the place to be. That was where you had sheltered during the tornado of ‘**`XX`**.\n\nI swallowed and stared at the lot, almost hypnotized. It stared back indifferently.\n\nDamaged by a tornado. Isn’t that funny. I had sheltered here once from a tornado. It was probably just dumb luck that the whole building hadn’t caved right in on my head. I had only been in one other tornado in my life, and that time I certainly wasn’t in a Wal-Mart. Like any respectable person, I had been at home.\n\nWe spent all night huddled in the bathroom. Mom and I were in the tub, her with one ear glued to the wind-up radio she bought from the Rural King that morning. Minnie, our elderly dachshund, had thrown her shiny black body over both of us. She shivered and moaned uncontrollably. Sometimes she would roll her eyes up at us and sigh. \n\nI only left the bathroom once that night, to get more batteries for my Game Boy. Looking back, I realize the worst of the storm must have been over. Why else would my parent let me walk through the house alone? But at the time I genuinely felt like I was taking my life in my hands. I remember closing the door to the bathroom behind me. It was like letting the door of a shallow crypt swing shut. I tip-toed through the house. Glass was rattling in every window. The storm howled outside. It wasn’t a movie sound either, it sounded like a voice, and sometimes it was many voices, and they were moaning right on the other side of the walls. It sounded like something \n\n(or some*things*)\n\nwas trying to speak, pretending to be human. \n\nThe batteries were in the dry pantry next to the refrigerator. I had made the trip a million times before, sometimes two or three times a day. But the sounds, rain and howling, were foreign to my young ears. Strange too was the alien light spilling through the kitchen window. It was almost green, pulsing in an irregular tattoo, and its rays were cut into swirling ribbons by the great black storm clouds that were racing by overhead. \n\nI stood rigid on the kitchen threshold, one hand wrapped around the thin door casing in a death grip. I groped for the light switch. I hated feeling for a light switch in a dark room. I had the idea - a stupid idea, even for a kid - that while my fingers were running along the waxy wallpaper some horrible, clammy hand would settle lightly over mine...\n\n*Don’t be an idiot.* Nothing could live in the dark. Not in the dark my child mind imagined. To me the darkness somehow contained a whole different world, like an alternate dimension. It was a shadow world that lived just a breath away from our own, and if could reach it you would see terrible wonders. You could reach it if you sidestepped just a certain way. Or you could there by climbing into the right tree hole. You could accidentally fall into it, maybe, and then you would cross over and come face-to-face with all manner of crouched and lurking monsters; things that were all hairy and had rows and rows of overlapping razor teeth, and eyes that glowed with yellow bloodlust. \n\nAnd these things that lived in the dark were hungriest for boymeat. Just the sight of my smooth and unbroken skin would drive them into a frenzy, and they would take me apart with their mouths and their hooked fingers and their teeth, slick and foamy, stringy with ravenous drool.  \n\n*Dumbass!* What would my mom say, if she caught me like this? Here he is, your only son, straddling the doorway like a lover, his eyes squeezed shut, his teeth gritted, mouth stretched out so wide you can see that ragged hole left by the molar that fell out last week! Funny? Oh you better believe it! *Grab the Polaroid and snap a picture, Ma! Make sure to save that one for his wedding!*\n\nThe wind was chucking hail against the house. It sounded like fingers tapping inside the walls. The moan came again and this time it sounded like a thick, otherworldly chuckle. The window above the sink was suddenly lit up with roiling green-yellow light. Lightning. Shadows sprang up across the wall and they did a spooky *danse macabre* before laying down again behind the furniture. \n\nMy fingers found the switch. Thank God!\n\nThey snapped it-\n\n-and nothing. No light!\n\n*Shit! The power!*\n\nLightning again. The kitchen was lit in a flashbulb burst. It left a bleary snapshot on my retinas, not really sight but an afterimage that my mind held for several seconds after the light died away.\n\nSomebody was standing in the corner. \n\nMy mental switchboard fizzled out, too overloaded to handle what I had seen. I just stood in the doorway, feeling my hand go slack and fall away from the switch, completely unable to stop it. My chest hitched up. The screams were too big to come out. \n\t\nHe was dressed in black. He wore a ski mask. It the kind you wore in winter, pulled over the head. His eye glowed through the oval holes. They were huge and glassy. Red embers flickered in the center of the pupils, which were huge and dilated in a way that later in life I would associate with a really good LSD trip.\n\n*There’s a man here,* my mind whispered. *There’s a man standing in your kitchen.* But that’s impossible, isn’t it? He wasn’t there a minute ago. And besides, the monsters can only live in the shadows, not the light. They die in the light. They have to stay in the dark. Right?\n\nI realized with sickening horror that I could still see the man’s eyes floating in the dark. They were twin pinpricks of glowing crimson punched into the shadows over the table. Those eyes dimmed, then brightened, like a embers smoldering in a breeze. \n\nA hallucination. It had to be. A mirage caused by the lightning. Like those black spots, the ones that float around after you get your school picture taken. \n\nBut the eyes were there. They were fixed on me, curiously, like a tiger who’s suddenly noticed you at the zoo. And those eyes, so evil and so awful, were those eyes now floating towards me? No. Not possible. Sure, there could be a man standing in my house. It was very possible that his eyes were there, staring at me in the dark\n\nBut those eyes couldn’t be floating towards me, not over the kitchen table that stood between us. *Over* it? Without moving it? Without his body touching the table in any way? Yet that’s just what they appeared to be doing. \n\nMy paralysis broke and I did the only thing I could think of: I flicked the light switch again. It was an automatic motion, a reflex, I might have even hit it accidentally. I really can’t remember. \n\t\nWhat I do remember is the overhead light ignited. A blast of tungsten hit my eyes. Tears sprang and I had to shut them. My irises screamed. Then the fear hit me again and I wrenched my eyelids open.\n \t\nBut when I looked into the corner, through eyes burning and streaming tears, heart pumping crazy, leaping beats into my ears, when I looked, the corner was empty. There was no shadowy figure there, no man in black. There was just a patch of flowery, powder blue wallpaper, and a round-framed black-and-white photo of my grandmother.\n\t\nUnder. Hiding under the table. \n\nI bent over so fast that both knees popped like twin shotgun blasts.\n\nNothing. There was no figure hiding between the forest of table-and-chair legs. There were no black, dilated eyes staring at me.\n\nI hurried back to the bathroom without turning off the lights. I explained to my mother that actually, I was tired of my game and I didn’t like it anymore. Then I sat down in the tub and let her stroke my hair until she fell asleep.\n\nI turned away from the parking lot, shivering despite the heat. I put my hand on the warm hood of the rental car and listened to the *tick-tick-tick* of the engine. My eyes drifted back to Jefferson Street. It led, I knew, straight downtown. To Vandalia. The town was still here after all these years. Changed, yes, but here. It had waited for me. \n\nI got in the car, started it, and drove back up the hill.\n\nNo, the man was not real. Monsters were not real. Things with glowing, hateful red eyes that grabbed you and pulled you into their world of fists and teeth and agony could not be real, not there, not in the same house where your mother stroked your hair and told you that she loved you. Those monsters only existed in the movies, and in books, and even then they were just flat men, two-dimensional, and if they did attack, you could just fold them into origami and rip them apart like paper. \n\nI believed that back then. I believed that with all my heart.\n\nBut even though I believed, I still woke up the morning after the storm and slipped into the kitchen. I wanted to turn off the lights before my mother woke up. But when I walked in I saw something that turned my stomach into a weeping, bloody wound above my groin. \n\nThere was a black pile of dirt on the floor, right behind the kitchen table. Right where my man had been standing.\n\nAnd to this day I don’t know why I did it, but before I turned off the lights I took out a broom, swept up the dirt, and tossed it into the wastebasket. \n\nI never mentioned it to anybody.\n\n\n*[FILE CONTINUES IN DOC NO. 45-0897] (TBD)*",

        "text": " It was red- glowing red. Mesmerizing and captivating. Its round shape beckoned me closer. I had never seen a red balloon that bright before. It had me stunned shocked and overwhelmed. I could not take my eyes off this beauty that was in front of me. I stepped forward, slowly following it as it moved forward- gently staying in view. My legs had found a life of their own. They moved eagerly towards it like a game of follow the leader. I gave in and let them lead the way. As my legs pushed forward, I realized that the red balloon’s string was within arm’s reach.  I reached out and grabbed the string. I felt exhilarated. It was in my hand. This magnificent balloon was one of a kind. There was no other balloon like this in the whole universe. I stared at its redness for what seemed like an eternity. It was dazzling, getting brighter by the second. \n\nAll of a sudden, the red balloon’s redness was blinding and I had to turn my head away. As my eyes averted from the balloon my heart sank. It was like the titanic as it sunk into the darkness of the sea and I was greeted by darkness. Fear gripped me in its razor-sharp talons. The hair on the back of my head stood up. I felt someone was watching me, their eyes glaring at me. I looked behind myself and was met with more darkness.  Had I gone blind? What was going on? And the most important question- where was I? I turned back towards the balloon. Looking at it directly was still impossible yet its brightness did nothing to illuminate the area.\n\nThen without warning, the balloon started to lose its brightness. The color darkened until it was a dark red. The color of blood. I looked at it as a shiver ran down my spine. Blood oozed out of the balloon and a drop fell to the ground. Terrified, I let go.\n\nQuickly I realized I had made a grave mistake- the balloon was the only light source in this darkness, it was my only salvation. I leaped towards it as it rose but a pair of hands reached out and yanked it before I could get a hold of it.\n\n I looked ahead. What I saw astounded me. Guilt and fear coursed through my body.  As I saw the figure with the balloon, she smiled and my fear disappeared as fast as it had come. Momentarily, I forgot all about the red balloon along with the eeriness of this creepy and dark place.  It was her. She was here. She had come back. \n\n“Mum” I cried. \n\nShe looked just as she did the last time, I had seen her. She had not aged a day. Her smile warmed my heart. I had not felt such a feeling in a long time. It brought me back to days when she was always happy and delighted to see me, a time in the past which I had long forgotten.  I could make out her familiar features. Her beautiful blue eyes looked like glittering sapphires and her pale white snowflake skin shone bright in the darkness. Her natural gold blonde hair was tangled up in knots which was unusual for her. She had always looked after her hair and combed it to perfection.  All of a sudden, her smile changed- there was something wrong. It was now fake like a framed picture it felt as though it could shatter any second. \n\n“Mum?” I whispered nervously.\n\nNo response. She stood there smiling, still as a statue. Life less. \n\n“Mum, you’re scaring me” I began to weep.\n\n“My Angel” she hissed in a spine-tingling voice. Her smile turned in to a malicious smirk. Her lips started to stretch until an evil grin covered her cheeks. I could see now that her teeth were not normal. They were sharp it reminded me of a shark. She looked like one of the Japanese legend demons called kuchisake-onna. Her eyes had turned dull they looked lifeless- void of emotions. She emitted a sinister evil and malicious ambience. This was not my mother. My mother was soft compassionate and caring. What was this monster before me?\n\n“Jamie my Angel, why are you surprised? You did this to me” she rasped accusingly whilst tilting her head to the side.\n\n“Mum, I’m sorry I’m sorry!” I screamed. \n\nThe scream echoed in the darkness. She advanced towards me. I stood still, petrified. I couldn’t move. It was as though I was rooted to the spot. Trepidation filled my heart. Suddenly her hands had found their way to my throat. Her nails dug in to my skin. I screamed in agony “um.” I tried speaking but nothing came out.\n\n“Jamie it’s time for you to pay” I looked in to her eyes hoping to find the care and comfort of my mother but there was no sign of the loving mum I longed for. Her eyes showed no sympathy. It was as though she had done this many times before. Reality began to sink in. I was going to die here. As I glared in to those dead eyes my head started to hurt. The pain was excruciating. Suddenly I was hit with them- the flashbacks. I was taken back to the day where it all began, about a year ago. I wanted to run away from the memory. I didn’t want to relive this moment. I knew how this story would unfold. I let out a scream on top of my lungs, so loud it was enough to wake the dead. “NO!”.\n\nThen I awoke. My heart rate had shot through the roof. I was covered in sweat from head to toe.  It took me a while to process my surroundings. I was in my bedroom sitting upright staring at the sunlight as it gleamed through the window onto my bed. I heaved a sigh of frustration, and then relief. It was only a dream. How many was that now? 8 times this month. I had seen this nightmare numerous times each time more intense than before. My only escape from the cruelty of reality was the land of dreams, but now dreams and nightmares had become part of my reality. No matter how much I tried to suppress or overcome them I couldn’t. They would come right back, reminding me of the grave sin I had committed. \n\n“Wayme” a small voice said.",

        "text": "I brought this guitar in may, just your standard Fender Telecaster. Wasn't my first guitar, just something to mess around and modify, everything seemed like normal, until about 3 weeks after I brought it. I have this feeling that someone's watching me at all times, even though I live completely alone. I've checked around my entire house, sleep with a 9mm under my pillow, but I've never seen anyone. I'll hear footsteps in my apartment, check with the gun and no one nor anything is around. \n\nThen I noticed there were claw marks in the carpet around the guitar. I don't own any pets, and never have friends around, I'm too busy to have a social life. Then claw marks started to appear around my room, one on the wall, one on my door. \n\nI decided to set a camera and tripod up and stay in a local hotel the night. The next day I went back to see my apartment had claw marks all over it. My furniture had moved, my kitchen sink was dented inwards, the camera had fallen over, and the tripods aluminum legs were bent in all sorts of directions. I check the camera footage, which showed seemingly nothing happening, until a split second of static at 10:52:43, then the apartment was in the state I found it. The time on the camera was continuing as normal. 10:52:43 (static)  10:52:44, 10:52:45. Everything happened at the same time. I asked my neighbors if they had heard anything strange. None of them said they heard anything happen at any point. \n\nI call the police, who 'looked into it'. One officer tells me it's possible someone broke in and smashed my stuff up, but there was no signs of a break in. The only thing in my apartment that wasn't damaged nor moved was the guitar I brought in may. All my other guitars had strings broken, scratches on the body, my prized Ibanez was on the floor, strings gone completely. \n\nI moved out of that place, moved into a new place in a different town completely. I had peace for 1 week. I'm scared for my life now. \n\nI can hear voices in the middle of the day, from seemingly that telecaster. I thought at first it was just the neighbors doing their thing. Then I started to hear unintelligible whispers at random times of the day. Then I started to get the nightmares. Oh good God. Nightmares of horrific things. I saw myself burn, I felt the pain, felt my skin melting, smelled the smell of burning human flesh, felt my strength deteriorating as my muscles were burning off. \n\nThe worst one yet felt like a bad acid trip. My 'son' (I don't have any children, not even a girlfriend) and I were at a campsite, and for some reason I kept repeating to him 'before you go to sleep, make sure it's not under your pillow'. Fuck knows what it could have been, but later that dream we were walking along some local park, and we saw a guy playing a little gig, with a Fender Telecaster, just like the one on my wall. A few moments later me and my son are walking through the town. Next thing I know he's just been hit by a van, the driver of the van was wearing a Fender Telecaster t shirt. \n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, to see the telecaster had blood on the fretboard and strings. \n\nI tried to sell it, to pawn shops, facebook market, ebay, craigslist, no one wanted it. Hell the charity shop didn't even want it for free. I tried leaving it on the street somewhere, so someone finds it and gets better joy out of it, I even stuck a little note on the guitar saying 'take me for free, my previous owner doesn't want me anymore and doesn't want money for me'. I went back to my apartment to see the guitar right where it would have been, drenched in vomit, blood and smelling of blood and piss. \n\nI woke up this morning with a message cut into my forearm 'i know everything, I see everything, I hear everything. You are no longer safe'. \n\nHelp me....",

        "text": "Any woman who has ever spurned a man’s advances already knows my story. Rejecting someone you have known and loved is, I think, even more perilous than rejecting a stranger.\n\nEdward and I dated for six months. He was an exceptional man in so many ways, but he soon revealed his contemptible side, and that soured the relationship. Signalled by numerous red flags, I broke up with Edward.\n\nHe couldn’t accept that. His relentless pursuit began. The monstrous man had veiled his true evil for so many months. I think he’d been aching to free it. His vengeance was savage and unyielding. Threatening social media posts. Candid photos he’d taken of me. An emailed schedule of my family’s movements. A restraining order did nothing to stop him.\n\nNevertheless, after months of stalking, the horrendous stalking came to a bitter end. In December, Edward tragically froze to death in his snow-covered, beaten-up, unheated Ford Mustang. He had been waiting outside my house for hours at the blistering height of winter. A neighbour found him in the morning.\n\nCards on the table. ‘Edward’ wasn’t even his real name, and I’m not exactly sure why I’m protecting his identity, given that he’s dead. I guess I’m still scared of him. Understandable, given that *even death*hasn’t halted his heinous hunt.\n\nEdward was a technological wizard. That was his true love. He called himself an innovator. Not a programmer — an *artist*. During the final month of our relationship, as I started to doubt the man’s ethical compass, he became obsessed with the idea of the human soul. Artificial intelligence bored him. The future, he said, was a mesh of man and machine. Immortality. He believed he could upload the human consciousness to a computer.\n\nHe didn’t invent the concept, of course. Mind uploading is a well-documented hypothetical among scientists and philosophers alike. *He’s watched too many sci-fi films*, I thought. But I suppose science fiction often becomes reality, doesn’t it? Many people think it’s impossible to upload the human consciousness to a computer, but I suppose they only think in terms of computing. Edward’s research went *beyond* ordinary programming. He was ranting and raving about greycode. An underground programming language of the occult.\n\nHis eerie obsession didn’t phase me, in all honesty. I would have endured the plight of the suffering artist, had he not struck me across the face on one particular evening. Abuse was the line. Edward apologised profusely, of course. But the longer I ignored him, the more violent his messages grew.\n\nAfter his death last month, I thought the torture would cease. It did, for a couple of weeks, but then awful things started happening.\n\n*Edward: Nice sunset, Natasha.*\n\nThat was his comment on a recent Instagram picture of me. My friends flooded my DMs, asking whether I thought Edward’s account had been hacked. *Obviously*. What an asinine question. The man was dead. It *had* to be somebody’s perverse prank.\n\nBut I’d blocked Edward’s account, which made the whole ordeal quite traumatising for me. I thought somebody had bypassed Instagram’s security. That made me feel vulnerable. I contacted Instagram about it. They apologised, suspended his account, and I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThe comments persisted, however. And it wasn’t just happening on Instagram. It was happening on every one of my social accounts. I believed that somebody was tormenting me — maybe one of Edward’s fucked-up relatives who blamed me for his untimely death. I told the police, and they promised to conduct a thorough investigation. *Yeah, right*.\n\nI was a little shaken, but I wouldn’t say I was scared. The cyber-harassment had stirred some of the old trauma and fear, but I felt resilient. Nobody could scare me as much as Edward, and Edward was dead. I was convinced that it was some idiot with a vile vendetta.\n\nIt was what happened a week ago that defied all rational explanation and filled me with fear unlike any I’ve ever experienced.\n\nOne night, I was lying in bed, and a ping from my laptop startled me. It was open on my desk, less than a foot from the end of my bed. I certainly hadn’t left it open — I hadn’t left it *switched on*, for that matter.\n\nAnd I hadn’t left it on Facebook. Who even uses Facebook anymore? The screen was scrolling by itself. *Somebody’s hacked my computer*. That was my first thought. The mystery hacker was looking at Edward’s profile. The scrolling stopped, and I found myself staring at an old photo of Edward and me at a party. It was from the early days of our relationship. We looked happy.\n\n“I get it, Ryan,” I murmured, assuming Edward’s brother to be behind the torture. “It’s my fault that he’s dead.”\n\nAnd then something horrifying happened. The photo moved. To be more specific, *Edward* moved. I, like everything and everyone else in that picture, remained static. But Edward, suddenly untethered, strolled over to the photographer. He was engulfing every square inch of the full-screen photo. My dead ex-boyfriend was staring through the laptop screen. Staring at me.\n\n“What the fuck is this?” I cried breathlessly.\n\nI wasn’t even sure how it was possible to override Facebook in that way, but I still felt that everything was within the realm of possibility. *It’s Ryan. It has to be Ryan*. That didn’t explain how he’d doctored an old photograph to include a moving video of Edward. *Deepfake technology*?\n\n“Hello, Natasha,” Edward said.\n\nHis voice was garbled, as if he were swirling in a blender. My chest tightened. *Did Edward record himself to torture me from beyond the grave?* I wondered.\n\n“You look so beautiful,” His inhuman voice gushed. “I like your new hair. And the dog pyjamas are adorable.”\n\nI yelped quietly. It couldn’t be a pre-recording. How would he have known that I’d change my hairstyle? How could he have known about the new pyjamas? *Ryan. It has to be Ryan. He’s watching me through my webcam.*\n\nAnd then something happened which couldn’t be attributed to Ryan.\n\nEdward’s demeanour shifted. As had been the case in our six-month relationship, he swiftly transitioned from a genial gentleman to a vehement villain. His pixellated head tilted to one side, as if he were simply ogling me from a fresh angle. His smile had only changed ever-so-slightly, but it was now brimming with malignancy.\n\nThe dead man’s charm was vanishing. So were his pupils, for that matter. Seconds later, all that remained were two white, soulless eyes. It felt as if I were seeing the real Edward at long last. The sub-human thing that lay dormant beneath his scintillating shell.\n\nA thunderous thudding sound sent a shockwave through my body. Horrified, I watched Edward’s hands pressing against the screen of my laptop. As if he were trapped underwater, he continued to push against the surface of the pixellated pool. The screen continued to flex. I screamed in unbridled terror. I finally accepted that it wasn’t Ryan. It wasn’t anything that could be explained by earthly rhyme or reason.\n\nI wasn’t going to wait for my undead abuser. Never again. I scarpered from my bed, beelining for the door of my room. Before I could flee, there was a blinding flash of light from my laptop screen. The door swung shut, and a piercing sound emitted from the speakers of my laptop. It sounded like a ghastly cry of agony.\n\n“You’re not leaving me again,“ Edward commanded.\n\nI rotated to face the digital entity that was slithering free from my laptop screen, which was stretching around him like elasticated rubber. When he finally escaped his digital prison, Edward’s long limbs glitched ghoulishly before me. He adjusted his posture, standing upright and gazing upon me with white, empty eyes. My stalking spectre widened his fiendish Cheshire Cat grin.\n\n“I found a way to live forever,” He whispered. “If you join me, I promise we won’t ever fight again.”\n\nI tirelessly battled to open my bedroom door, which was being held shut by an invisible force. Twisting my head to look at the monstrous creature behind me, I whimpered in horror. Edward slowly stumbled towards me on unsteady, glitching legs, toppling his head to one side. I screeched at the top of my lungs and turned back to face the door, desperately yanking the handle.\n\nThat was when I had a dreadful idea.\n\nI darted towards my bedside table, swerving past Edward’s outstretched arms. Picking up a half-full glass of water in one hand, I turned to face my ex-boyfriend. His lips parted, and a pit of blackness was revealed. That same high-pitched wail erupted from the caverns of his demonic body. He knew what I was about to do.\n\nWithout a moment’s thought, I launched the glass of water at the digital ghoul that was lumbering towards me. Edward screamed in a robotic cry so deafeningly loud that my ears popped. As the water soaked through his shimmering, translucent skin, he began to spasm manically. His unbound digital form retreated, and I watched the laptop screen reclaim him.\n\nMy bedroom door swung open, so I assumed my undead stalker must simply have been too distracted to keep me trapped. I seized my opportunity and fled my flat.\n\nI have been living in my car for the past few days. This is the first time I’ve used technology since the incident. I’m currently in a computer café. There are plenty of people around, and I don’t think Edward would come for me in a public place, but who knows?\n\nI just wanted to post here because I need help. I don’t know where to go or what to do. I have nightmares of being imprisoned in Edward’s eternal digital prison.\n\nI keep seeing flickering screens out of the corner of my eye. Should I get off the grid and avoid technology for the rest of my life? I can’t run. He’s everywhere.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I'm a rookie writer, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me some constructive criticism. On any and everything you see wrong, didn't like, that could have been done and/or commented better, thank you, and injoy.\n\nTo, \n\n       Hom, this may concern.\n\n Let me tell you a story. I hope you come to love.\n\n\n (Throughout this, they speak in a jovial disposition with a slightly off somber tone) There once was a young man named Adrian. AJ if you got to know him(soft snicker). He was a bit… different to put it nicely. He was like… (in a hush and dismissive tone) an empty shell, a puppet with no master, or an orphan who knows. \n\n\n Precisely, why they were abandoned in the first place. Mhm, no, not quite. While these comparisons do give you an idea of how he was.What he was truly encapsulated in his eyes or rather, the lack thereof.(In a dismissively tone)Of course coming with all the gore of having bloody pits where your eyes should've been. \n\n\n(said with a  melancholy tone)But, here's the real kicker. When his body was found, his eyes were not only gone but it was more accurate to say they never existed to begin with.*trying to force down a smile* But not just his eyes, oh no same thing with his mouth, his ears, with everything else on his face. *Chuckles* I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh. \n\n\n\n It's just. I can't help but smile when imagining his family's faces when they can't see his *frans. The chuckles like clearing your clears throat and take a breath*, now where were we. *Trails off for a few moments, then snaps their fingers when getting back on track.*\n\n\n\nAh,*with a smile on their faces* Don't get me wrong. I'm sure he was a good kid, and all he would have (probably) been an even better man. I am just saying that being around him. As he is now, you would most certainly feel as though you're trapped in a pitch black room where you haven't the foggiest idea of where you are or how you got there. All you know all you care about is the dimly lit wall where a mannikin eligatory sit there like a parent who shows how love for their children dies just a bit more  with each passing day. \n\n\n You stare, you stare at it for so long your vision blurs  from how long you haven't blanked or how your body has become little more than rotten wood devoured by vines(a deep 2 octave too low for a normal human to be capable of. With a metallic,flat,cold, and calculating tone like a robot, how's capable of all the wrong emotions) ripping every drop of what life had to offer. From the ones you love, those you loathe, to everything ounce you once were.\n\n\n Even after they take everything, even when (returns it normal tone without skipping a beat), there's nothing left to take. You don't dare not move a muscle. You don't dare not blank an eye. You don't dare not speak a single word. Because you knew you knew it couldn't wait till you did because. It just can't stop smiling at you. It just can't stop shaking, until you give it a reason to.\n\n\nBut I digress. I'm sure, me (chuckles)saying all things calling me a fucking weirdo is a grievous understatement. But I understand you, hell. I truly sympathize with you, scouts honor. I wouldn't judge you how could I. How could I? You know what. I'll even leave you with some advice. Make sure you don't make the same mistakes as poor AJ here and keep your body stiff and your eyes looked. On those who came before you. It makes it all the more fun for us when you do.😁\n\n\nOh! And P.S\n\nWe're not lurking in some dark shadows or some forgotten alley. No, no, that is far too boring, especially nowadays. We'll be seeing you soon, real soon.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n                 You'll never be too far away.",

        "text": "I finally decided to come on here and share my 13 year horror story with you. I'm just going to break everything up into short stories and I'm only going to tell the scariest of the scariest since so many things happened almost daily. \n\nThis house was a older house in a lower to middle class neighborhood. It had a long driveway and a separate brick garage in the back about 30 ft from the house. Between the house and garage there was a clothes line hanging up. It's believed to be on a native burial ground but I can't confirm nor deny that.\n\nI've always been connected to the other side and sensitive to seeing, hearing and smelling spirits. \n\n( Stories aren't in a particular order ) \n\nOne day I was about 5, my mom was standing outside grilling and I could see her from the window. It was an old window that you had to use a stick or something to hold most of the windows up, not this one though, this one had a lock on it. Anyways, I'm a short kid so I was holding onto the window seal to see out of it. The window was up. I wasn't jumping or kicking or any sudden movements and the window unlocked and slammed down on my fingers. Bruised my hands up but luckily nothing was broken. \n\nThere was the basic foot steps, the TV would constantly and I mean constantly turn itself on and off, there was 3 knocks on the back door and no was was ever there, you could hear voices when no one was home &amp; my dog was petrified of the garage. He would rather stand outside in the rain and snow than go into the garage. \n\nI would have the most vivid and disturbing dreams in this house. Stuff that I don't want to  talk about because I legit have to talk about them in therapy. Just to sum everything up I was ALWAYS in danger and always running from something. \n\nOne night I was up hella late and it was pitch black in my room and I saw a fucking face creep up from behind the screen to around it. From what I remember it was pale and not too happy looking. I screamed because of how long I saw it and how slow it was moving towards me. Then it disappeared right front of my eyes. \n\nOne night I saw what I would call demons in the back yard by my swing set and I saw all kinds of weapons that idk if they even exist in real life, no guns tho and I saw something chewing on the swing set. The next day I went outside there were tons of bite/scratch marks that wouldn't have gotten there otherwise bc of the location. At first my mom thought I was talking about actual men in the backyard and not ghosts so she got out her Glock and got into shooting position lol. \n\nOh for whatever reason idk if I just had an over active imagination or what but I swear my stuffed animals with the plain black eyes used to move in my room. I'm not talking about moving from one spot to another when not looking, I'm talking about turning their heads and literally moving towards me. It was always at night in my dark room. It got so bad that I eventually didn't sleep with stuffed animals. \n\nOne night not long after my GMA died, I was laying awake looking up at the ceiling and I was sleeping in my mom's queen bed with her. There was a small drawer dresser to the left of the room, the queen size bed in the middle of the room, a long floorboard heater on the right wall with a window and right in front of the bed there was a big mirror dresser with about 3 feet of space from the dresser to the corner of the wall. Idk what caught my attention but I looked into the corner and lost it at what I was seeing. I saw a pale woman sitting in the corner leaned against the wall with long black hair and a blank expression. I screamed so loud my mom jumped out the bed. \n\nOne time my mom got home w some groceries and put them on the stove and it was turned off and everything caught on fire. \n\nMy neighbor used to say she could see things walking the border of our property lines from her bedroom window. \n\nThroughout the years the earth would unearth what we are pretty positive were human bones. \n \nLet me tell possibly the scariest night of all, that was the night we tried to finally leave the house. \nSo my mom and I were packing up a uhaul all day and at this point it was now 11pm-1am. We finished packing the truck and told the guys that helped us move that they could go ahead and go to the other house in the next city while we deal with the last few things we needed to pack in our car. My mom was very aware of the bad spirits there, so she told me to wait in her car. I watched from the front seat as my mom had a literal tug-of-war with the door. I watched it swing back and forth at least 3 times before my mom could shut the door completely. As she put her key in the lock the patio light above her head literally exploded and shattered above her head. Now we were in pitch dark. My mom ran to her car (that never had any issues at this point) and tried to start it but the battery was somehow dead! She had to run through my backyard to the neighbors house to get a jumper cable so we can leave. The feeling I had was horrible because it truly felt like whatever was on that land was trying their hardest to keep us there. Once my mom got the car jumped we officially left and never returned. \nThat was 10 years ago now and from what I can tell the house has switched between owners at least 4 times now. \n\nI was genuinely terrified of that house growing up and I believe it contributed to the years of bad mental health after leaving. I have more stories from the other homes I've lived in if I ever feel like writing them out.\n That's all I feel like typing for now. Ty for your time.",

        "text": "Every night when I try to sleep, the stairs begin to creak. A screech that whispers worryingly through the air. Such a slight, simple sound, yet it invokes such a feeling of eeriness. Our minds seemingly search for reasons to be afraid, to be scared.\n\nThe creaking starts slow, and distant. A faint few footsteps, climbing the bottom steps quietly. It then quickens on the quest to scare me, as the pace picks up, and the creaks grow louder. It ends with a thundering thwack on the final top step. This pattern perpetually continues, all night, every night.\n\nYet when I rise in my robes, into the hallway, all confused, the sounds suddenly stop. They wait warily for my exit so that they may continue. When my body hits the bed, there again, outside the door, the creaks continue evermore.\n\nMy son left this world weeks ago. The sounds began thereafter. Perhaps, I thought, he wants me to hear him again. Perhaps, I thought, he wants to communicate with me. This brought me comfort and subsided my fears for a few days.\n\nFor just that short while, the creaks, they made me smile. My happiness was not long-lived as the haunting only got worse. This was not my child, not my family, I've been visited by a curse. Lights would flicker or turn off in every room I entered. Knives would fly from their drawers, towards my body they ventured.\n\nMy son died with no wounds or fractures found, his death was merely a mystery. He just dropped dead one day, presumed to be a medical issue. My son had nothing of the sorts yet the doctors told me I must be mistaken. They assured me it was likely to be an unknown, unseen illness. I told them it was unbelievable.\n\nMy world whirled and spun that day. It was as if someone hit the pause button on life, with him being taken so suddenly, without explanation, causing so much devastation. I could not sleep that night in bed, with so many thoughts in my head. That was the moment in which the creaks started, the very same day that my son had parted.\n\nNo, this creaking, it is not my son sending signs. This is a demon sending sinister signals. Mocking me, and tormenting too. This demon took my child away, and stays around as a clue. I don't know if it wants me next, and if it does I don't know what to do.\n\nThe creaks, my god the creaks, they won't end. I sit here every night and listen, longing for my son. I'm being driven mad by these sinister sounds that seemingly scream all around.\n\nEvery step I take is cautious, for danger seems to follow. Being in my own house makes me nauseous, as my life feels empty and hollow.\n\nNobody believes me or listens to my claims. They call me crazy.\n\nI live now in a fear so deep, wanting only to shout and shriek. Every night when I try to sleep, the stairs continue to creak.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10om5tk/tales_of_point_perilous_lighthouse/",
        "text": "At some point on the American coast where the horizon is almost constantly fog and where the rocks are most treacherous, there is a lighthouse. It doesn't have a particular name that I know of, though the locals of the small town nearby simply call it Point Perilous.\n\nIt has, for all intents and purposes, earned the name. \n\nI've worked there for almost five years now and I hesitate to call it bizarre. I've learned that everything is normal when you live there day to day, and anyone who knows of lighthouses can simply assume things might go bump in the night. Hauntings come with the territory.\n\nBut, it pays well, its not close to my hometown, and every week or so I'm able to head into town for a few hours of free time. Its not the most sociable of jobs in all honesty, but I’ve had worse.\n\nThe only form of life I interact with on a daily basis is a beast named Nessie, the so called ghost of Point Perilous. He's an old dog that’s been here since the lighthouse was built and he'll be here when the town and ocean itself are long gone. He's good company for a beast, and is smart enough to definitely be on the payroll.\n\nIf he is I've never heard.\n\nThe boss doesn't allow any form of internet or cellphone for reasons I’ve never cared to ask, probably something about it interfering with the radio signals or electronics. The locals say there's no service anyway. The only contact to the outside world that I can get is an old radio that has three channels in total I can successfully remember. The boss, the news, and the channel I announce any particular dangers to nearby ships. Some days the only voices that are alive I hear are the chatter between ships, and sometimes I prefer it to everything else. Gossip is gossip and like anyone else, I'm a sucker for it.\n\nI reach the police through the boss, but even than its still a waiting game to see if the sheriff even bothers to show up. Its not that they don't try, I hear, its just they know they can't do much about the shrieking women in the forest or the horses that I’ve chased off so many times. I know they can get here, the road along the cliffs isn't that bad.\n\nThe sorry sod of a local tasked with bringing up food and supplies to the lighthouse proves it. Lucky for me, they always bring a stack of missing persons reports and brings back any reports I might have. Usually that report isn’t much, but they like the assurance I’m alive. Keeps the sheriff from coming up for a wellness check I guess. In return, I keep a look out for the missing, even have their photos posted on the door.\n\nThey always show up. Everyone does.\n\nThis week has been different. The thing about missing people is that they're almost always dead or half way there. I do what I can to warm up those with something left kicking in them but the sea is never to kind to strangers. Half frozen is better than half dead, easier to deal with in my opinion.\n\nI had been on the lookout for a small crew that had been lost, attacked by something the delivery man wouldn’t describe. He had also whispered though, when I didn't ask further, that apparently they were trying to take something from the shipwrecks under the waves.\n\nYou never touch what the water claims in this town, they must’ve been fools or visitors for not knowing. Those can be used interchangeably in this town. The old sailors love to warn everyone not to go to the wrecks or just about anywhere within a mile of the water, but it never works much. Not when its very easy to see them setting off into the ocean in the morning.\n\nAll the same, a storm was in the air. I could smell it and see it well on the horizon and the news station said so. Its always right about these things. The men probably wouldn’t turn up but I looked to the horizon just in case. \n\nSometimes I see flickers of lights from ships, the occasional call in morse code for either help or the radio channel. No help messages had been shared of recent, nor did I hear anything of them. For all I knew, they were alive.\n\nI was checking the windows for leaks and making sure the light would keep steady last night like I always do. No sailor would be out during the storm, but the lighthouse had to remain on at all times, through storm or death, light and horn.\n\nI had just finished fastening the window to the bedroom when Nessie started barking.\n\nNessie is silent as a ghost most days beyond his small huffs and sighs. I was used to hearing his footsteps though in between the calls of the lighthouse’s foghorn. That's what I considered the loudest noise he could possibly make.\n\nThe sound was like a gunshot, echoing through the rooms and in my head like the pinball machine at the local diner. I ran downstairs to find him staring at the door, a growl in his throat that only came when someone had washed up on shore and that I needed to go help immediately.\n\nHe's a good dog like that.\n\nThe door barely could open with the force of the wind, the storm had arrived far too early.\n\nIf you've never been in a storm on the sea, know that its freezing. Thousands of tiny needles prick your skin and soak you to the bone, even through the thickest coat. I can't exactly recommend it. I could barely make out the ground as I held up an old electric lantern and even than everything was mostly just mud. Nessie blended into the darkness beyond, his deafening barks leading the way down to the beach.\n\nIn all honesty, its less of a beach and more of a million rocks thrown together. The ocean was nearly to the cliff face and the ground was coated in muck.\n\nI called for Nessie to come back, whoever was out here wouldn't be alive, not with the rain itself so fierce. I didn't want to lose my one companion. I found him with his nose in the rocks, a small and raised tide pool that was barely protected from overflowing by an overhang. He was trying to climb into it. I shoved him aside before he tried to enter the too small space and got stuck.\n\nThere was a child.\n\nA full on child who was staring up at me with tear stained eyes. It was difficult to see them, in the shadows cast by my lamp, but they were assuredly there, eyes almost glowing and hair as muddy red as the deep sea creatures.\n\n\"You okay?!\" I had shouted over the storm and they didn't respond. \"You're parents around?!\"\n\nThey looked past me to the ocean where the sea was dark and angry, highlighted behind lightning as thunder boomed yet nothing seemed to exist besides waves and water. It was dangerous. Whoever their parents had been are definitely dead. Nothing good survives the storms here.\n\nI picked them up out of the tide pool, holding them close even when they struggled to try and get back to the small place. They were as cold as the corpses I would usually find and silent as one as well, soaked to the bone in a too big sailor’s shirt and trunk. I couldn't tell how old they are at the time, and admittedly still can't. We rushed back to the lighthouse, Nessie thankfully at my heels before the door slammed shut behind us from the force of the wind. \n\nI set them down in the bathroom, trying to will the water heater to finally work for once and produce an even semi warm bath. The crashing from the storm was loud even through the walls. It sounded like something was wailing, pained and saddened. Sometimes you heard it in the air, often from the forest, but never had it been so pained. \n\nIt made me want to cry.\n\nThe child seemed to be listening to it, head tilted. They were still silent even when I questioned them. I was guessing mute though they also seemed particularly shy, curled up on the floor next to Nessie. Nessie had taken an immediate liking to them, a first though a thankful one at that.\n\nEventually the bath water was warm and when they sat up to investigate, immediately hellbent on getting in, still clothed. I let them do as they pleased, hesitant to try and help them though when they just sat in the water with a small pleased smile, I figured it would be fine. \n\nAs long as they were warm. \n\nNessie laid his head on the side of the tub, staring at the child who stared back. With that handled, I fired up the radio.\n\nIt crackled to life, exploding in static before leveling out to hear the quiet jazz music that usually occurred when the news station was on break. It was almost never, but the storms must have scared the host off. I switched it to the marked dial, it crackled once more before becoming a crystal clear silence.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said into it, probably sounding angrier than one should with their employer, \"I found a kid in the storm.\"\n\nIt was quiet for a few moments, before the boss's voice sounded through, hollow and uninterested. \"Dead or alive.\"\n\n\"Alive, can you alert the police? Their parents were lost at sea.\"\n\n\"Injured?\" \n\n\"No. They're fine. Can you please alert the police? This is serious, its bad here and if there's more people out there, it won't be pretty.\"\n\n\"We will. Watch the child.\"\n\nThey went silent and wouldn't answer further.\n\nThey're incredibly lucky they pay so well.\n\nThe kid peaked around the corner at me, almost comical with Nessie’s head above them in a Scooby Doo style. They were soaked yet almost dirt and sand free surprisingly. I sighed, grabbing one of the shitty old towels I kept on hand to scrub what was left from them. They happily took one of my old shirts to wear as clean clothes though it was more like a dress on them than anything else. Nessie seemed to find it funny. \n\nI herded them to the bed. The extra blankets would keep the kid warm hopefully and Nessie jumped up as always, taking his spot at the end as the kid sat staring at me. \n\nI could still see their eyes when I shut off the lights but a lot of things stared in the dark so I couldn't really mind. \n\nI also didn't mind as the storm continued into the night, that’s just what simply happened when you lived close to the sea. The mirror lagged behind by a few seconds when I brushed my teeth and I honestly couldn't tell if the water tasted saltier than it usually did. The chair by the hallway's window creaked and I set an extra pillow on it from the closet.\n\nStorms meant I could sleep and I intended to make full use of that. I stole a blanket and intended to settle on the old couch for the night.\n\nThere was a thumping outside on the deck.\n\nThings thumped in the night. Usually it was pacing in the old office above the living quarters, a steady drumming walk that became heavier when a body had washed up on shore. Sometimes something banged on the closet door and I'd learned over the years that its best to keep it closed or I'd end up with another scar around my wrist from something grabbing onto me. Occasionally the hallway window rattled when the thing was dirty and I needed to get up on the ladder to clean the outside of it.\n\nFootsteps on the deck were new, especially ones loud enough to be heard through the rain.\n\nNothing new happens at the lighthouse, or nothing new had been happening.\n\nI decided to check it out, heading downstairs after checking that the kid was still in place on the bed. I felt bad leaving them alone. When I was a kid I'd always had my siblings with me at night besides when they'd be taken for church services. I hated sleeping alone. I didn't want the kid to experience that nagging fear as well.\n\nBut I didn't trust the footsteps, not when I could see Nessie's ears following it. I whistled for him to follow and took my lamp outside. The kid would've been safe in the lighthouse. Nothing had ever gotten in before that hadn't already been there. Nothing was supposed to.\n\nI found a man on the  deck, stomping on it with heavy boots like a mad man before looking up at the creak of the front door. He stared at me for a moment and than dashed off, disappearing soon. His face looked familiar and it didn't sit right with me. Nessie growled but I stopped him from running after. \n\nThe storm would swallow both of them whole if it had the chance. \n\nSomething screamed. Not the wailing from the sea or the cry from the forest. Something from the lighthouse. It was an awful sound, heart wrenching and horrifying in the same breath.\n\nI stormed in, slamming the door behind me with barely a glance as Nessie led the way.\n\nThe last box of food that had been brought had a total of six missing men from a singular ship, all presumed dead when their half eaten dingy had been brought ashore. \n\nTwo stared at me in the bedroom with faces that matched those on the door, one holding down the squirming child and the other holding an axe in their hands.\n\nWide yellow eyes stared at me for a moment, a pause that had the men tense and than the kid began to thrash. The man holding them down shouting at the other to hurry as the other told him to hold it still.\n\nAnd the child screamed, louder than before. It was ear splitting, making us fall to our knees as a steady ringing began. Nessie charged forward and ripped the axe from one of their hands.\n\nAll I could hear though was the screaming. \n\nSadness. \n\nWhy was I sad though? It was like everything was missing, like the only thing I’d known had been ripped away. Every thought of home, the very warmth I’d always known gone and leaving me alone with no idea who I am.\n\nThe sea was gone, ripped away and calling, hoping for comfort. I could hear it. \n\nAnd it was gone as Nessie howled. We had all dropped to the ground to hold our heads and I could feel the warm blood dripping into my palms from my ears. It rung in the air still, the storm worsening with its call.\n\nThe kid scrambled away from them, hiding behind me as the men stared at me in anger.\n\n\"Hand it the fuck over,\" One of them said, voice shaking. \"Hand it the fuck over so it can pay for what its done.\"\n\nI just pushed them behind me more. The sea was wailing as the child sobbed. \n\n\"Can't do that,\" I said back as Nessie crouched, muscles tense and fur seeming to ripple in the darkness. \n\n\"You're going to kill us all,\" one of them hissed and I honestly didn't care. I was not going to talk with a stranger like he wasn't trying to kidnap a child. \"You don't know what's out there, what it fucking did to us, or whatever the fuck its after it. Let us end this before it brings something else.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to end,\" I said simply, \"I'm a lighthouse keeper, its not my job to understand.“\n\n\"This isn't a fucking lighthouse-\"\n\nYou know, sometimes I forgot that Nessie was described as a guard dog on the job description. There's never been anything that’s attacked me directly. Sure things had tried but usually they backed off without much fuss.\n\nIt was surreal to see Nessie's jaws latch onto the man's neck and rip it away, cutting off whatever he wanted to say. I forgot the color of blood.\n\nThe kid just hid behind me, silent as a ghost.\n\nThe next day the boss would call and say there are no missing children reports, only four men found dead from a local ship and two missing. The boss's voice spoke of knowing. I just said I hope we find them. \n\nThey all turn up one way or another, eventually.\n\nI woke up with the child at my side and Nessie at the other on the too small couch in the living room. The radio was playing the music before the morning news show and soon the host’s voice would greet us as I cooked breakfast.\n\nThe bodies were gone, probably food for the thing under the stairs and the guppies in the tide pools. Apparently the kid eats raw fish which is a bit strange but they ate the bones as well so its less clean up for me.\n\nThe kid has a few new freckles. They definitely didn’t have any before. They match mine.\n\nThe library is empty which is good because I forgot to wash my boots from the night before and the kid has taken to hissing at anyone who gets too close. Nessie is keeping them from eating books, and the sea is still wailing. \n\nThe lighthouse seems pleased, perhaps it'll let me survive a few weeks more to update again. I don't really want to think of what the man meant, because if this isn't a lighthouse than the only source of information might have just died. \n\nWell, at least the old sailors at the bar are still around, that lot knows almost everything. Maybe they'll agree that something is wrong with the sea.",

        "text": "Week 3–5\n\nIt’s been almost a month since my last visit to that damned trail. Since my last attack. My newly found friends, the ones dangerously addicted to the supernatural stuff, convinced me to eventually return. At least one last time. They provided a sensible reason too.\n\nSo, that night when I left my home, the following morning and for the past three weeks, I have been waking up with welts and dark black bruises on my arms, legs, and face. It’s like I have an illness of some sort. Randomly, out of the blue. Not to mention, I’ve also developed consistent night terrors. Every night, for the past three weeks. I’ll wake up in cold sweats between the hours of 2:00 am and 3:00 am. It’s spot on every night. The same nightmare. I’m being dragged down that trail by an almost translucent creature. There’s an outline in front of me, as I’m being dragged. It’s sharp and spikey. If the color was full, it would for sure be jet black. The outline of this thing was humanoid, but the way that it moved was proof that it was far from human. My body feels like it’s burning &amp; I can’t move. I’m not tied or bound. I just cannot move. This creature is making sounds as it’s dragging me. Gurgling and growling I think. It sounds like it’s hungry or angry. Hangry maybe? I know it’s not the time to be funny, but I could use a laugh right now. Considering my current situation.\n\nMy friends tell me that these “night terrors” are demonic attacks. Like getting in a fight, but just on the spiritual plane. Or something weird like that. I’m not completely sure. Not sure that I’ll ever be able to believe in or understand such things. They’re interesting, to say the least. So, according to my friends, if I want these horrible things to stop, I have to return to that trail. Where it all began. I have to face whatever this thing is and demand it to stop. Command it to leave me. This is the sensible reason to return. Apparently. But, then again, look at what I’m dealing with. What choice do I have? All of this is just impossible. Ridiculous.\n\nMy friends have shared with me that they are indeed paranormal enthusiasts. Which, was quite obvious. One of them has been studying paranormal investigation techniques and the science behind it all. The other two have been studying demonology and how to cleanse people of negative energies. In some cases, actual demons. Like living beings that latch to you and deliberately try to harm you and those around you. It’s crazy talk! But, every morning is a solid reminder that the crazy is indeed real. It’s happening to me and affecting my physical body. Ultimately, my friends are considering creating a local paranormal team. Their primary goals would be to gather evidence that the supernatural world exists and to help those in need from what is considered spiritual oppression. Even full-blown possession. Like what you see in the movies apparently. They’ve offered me a spot on their future team, as a researcher and investigator. They said, with my personal experience and open, yet logical mind, we could make a pretty amazing team. They make a good point and I feel honored, but I don’t feel ready. Not yet. I don’t feel that I believe in it enough, or care. Plus, if this paranormal ghost-haunting stuff turns out to be real after all, I’m going to need some time away from it. Seriously.\n\nAlong with all of this to consider, they have provided me with a very detailed breakdown of what I seriously need to consider doing. That is if I want to end this impossible nightmare of course. They have taken the liberty to do a lot of research on the local area. Anything and everything that you could think of. Their research included ghost stories, tragedies, murders, assaults, kidnappings, cults, witchcraft, and so on. Nothing came back with positive results. Now, even though nothing showed up from their research, that doesn’t mean that nothing has ever happened. Or recently happened. This just means that something may not have been discovered or written about yet. What is being considered right now is that there could have recently been a murder or possibly some form of a dark ritual. My friends keep going back and forth between these two possibilities the most. I mean, they make sense. It’s not like a ghost attack can happen out of nowhere for no reason. Right?\n\nI’m going to “stoop” to their level for a moment. Perhaps I’ve had an attachment all of my life. Maybe I’ve only had this alleged attachment for the past five or ten years. Or, according to them, a real classic reason for a haunted location or person is disturbing a grave site. Moreso, a Native American burial ground. Also known as sacred or cursed land. That’s depending on who you are and your intentions of course. But, I wasn’t being disrespectful or disturbing anything. For the past three years, I have run that trail, and I have done no such thing. I have no clue, but it’s possible I guess. From what the guys have been sharing with me lately, these are some other possibilities to consider. The research they’re doing is extensive. I thought college was bad. The tunnel ahead of me looks dark and endless. With no answers to be found. But why now? Why all of a sudden is this thing making itself known to me? Why is it attacking me? Why did this all start at that specific park? Why on the Abbaduk Trail? Why in the form of screams? Why did it start at 8:00 pm and not 3:00 am? The infamous “Witching Hour” that I’m hearing so much about. So many damned questions and sadly no answers. Not yet. But, the more I think about it, the more I want to know.\n\nOver time I’ve become less and less fearful. I’ve made praying a daily and nightly routine, being that it’s the only weapon I know to use in such a scenario. What else can I do? What I’ve noticed, is the more I pray and the more I believe in the power of my prayer, the less often and the less severe my attacks have become. It seems to be working. Like actually working. So, I guess it won’t hurt to keep doing it. My friends also have encouraged me to keep praying. Anything positive and filled with good intentions can break down a negative being or force. They’ve been praying with me as well. Between the three of them, they all have been allowing me to stay at their homes throughout this entire process. Talk about being lucky. I can’t be alone right now and I need as much guidance as possible on what to do to stop this.\n\nWe haven’t visited the actual location since we all met. It’s been more or less a time of preparing. What we are preparing for is to conduct an investigation and then an actual deliverance. The deliverance is to be done on me and the land. We are going to return to that exact spot on that exact trail and investigate the surrounding areas. Perhaps we’ll find something that will indicate what this thing is and why it’s chosen to attack me. We’re planning on going tomorrow evening. We’re going to start the investigation during the day. Starting during the day will help us get a better understanding of our surroundings. It’s also so that we may sweep the area thoroughly. To see if we can find anything out of the ordinary that could tell us what this thing is and why it’s there. The guys seem excited but also determined to help me end this. I feel excited too, but my excitement is to find some answers. I’m not exactly excited to face this thing head-on. Especially not in its own backyard. So much could go wrong. I know I’ll be in a group, but there’s this feeling in my gut that’s telling me not to go. Fear, I guess.\n\nAlso, I don’t know what’s going to happen. The unknown is my worst enemy. Will all of this finally end? Or will it only get worse once we start fighting back? On the other hand, I do feel safer. I have a support system now. My support system seems strong and able. I’m no longer alone and I’m more ready to fight than I’ve ever been. I’m so tired though. This exhaustion has become my fuel to fight. An unexpected transition for sure. I’m just done. But, I’m ready. I have to be.\n\nWeek 3–5: Night 1\n\nTonight’s the night! We’re putting a stop to this demonic attachment crap! I’m going to sleep in my own bed tonight! After all of this insanity is said and done. And I will not be sharing my bed with any uninvited guests anymore. I still woke up with my typical welts and bruises. This time, they weren’t as bad though. The prayers seem to be working their magic. Good magic mind you. The nightmare didn’t occur this time either. Instead, I had a dream about war. It wasn’t super vivid, but the sensation and emotions attached to my dream felt very real and personal. There were battles taking place. Lots of screaming and anger. Specifically, I heard the screams from the woods. I didn’t feel scared or in trouble. I felt victorious and powerful. I felt alive. The screams got louder over time and tried to tear me down. But, it couldn’t. I was able to scream back and prayed right after. Then, there was a blast of white light and I woke up. My heart was pounding and I was sweating pretty badly. But, I didn’t feel helpless or like I was about to be beaten to death. It was different this time. I have no idea why or how, but it was different. A good kind of different.\n\nThe time is 5:15 pm. My friends and I went over the plan one last time. We grabbed our gear, made sure all devices were charged and accounted for, grabbed a bite to eat, and loaded the vehicle. We arrived at the park just a little past 6:00 pm. The guys asked me to show them where I heard the screams and ultimately where my attacks first started.\n\nWe didn’t grab any gear other than some flashlights. For when it got dark. We walked the trail to the spot in question and began to search the surrounding woods. This was the first time I’d been back in about a month. And for the first time in a long time, there was no screaming. There were people there too. There were families having picnics and children playing on the playground. Runners tackling the Abbaduk Trail as I used to. With no worry in the world. There were so many people and I loved that so much. I almost felt like things were back to normal. But, I knew better. They weren’t. Once we arrived at the spot, two of the guys went left off the path into the woods, while I and my other friend took the right side. The plan covered what we were looking for. Anything that shouldn’t be there. These things included clothing, money, bottles, figurines, or any trace of a human being.\n\nThe first step was to rule out any sign of a murder scene. The second step was to rule out any sign of possible witchcraft or ritual activity. And the third step was to respectfully search the area for any signs of burial grounds or lost communities. If any of these scenarios could be ruled out, then it would seem that this thing has been with me a lot longer than originally thought. We searched for hours and came up with nothing. This honestly disappointed me beyond belief. I started to feel depressed, which quickly turned to fear. Not that I wanted anything bad to have happened to someone, but I wanted to find an answer. The answer, to what this thing is and why it’s terrorizing me. Finding the answer seemed to only become more complicated and less likely as time went on.\n\nI’m tired, I’m scared, I’m confused, and I’m lost. What am I going to do? If this thing is connected to a family member from years ago, where do I even start? Do I have enough sanity to keep looking? To keep trying to get rid of this thing? Again, I’m done. I’m just so tired of looking for answers and constantly being attacked by some freak of nature. And for no damn reason. Not a good reason at least. Is this thing natural? Can I even consider it that? No. It’s not. I’m just losing my mind and I don’t know what else to do.\n\nIt’s now 8:15 pm. The guys and I are done searching the grounds. It’s too dark now. Even in the light, we weren’t able to find anything. Maybe the area was cleaned up. Maybe some animals came by and ransacked the area that we were searching. Years before our search today. Either way, it was dark and it was that time of the night. It was time to fight. The trail had become quiet and still. No more people. The four of us had met back in the middle of the trail and sat down in a circle. Back to back. No gear. This part of the plan was to observe the area of interest naturally. Using only our senses. Honestly, we were doing what I did the first two times that I encountered the screams. Nothing. All we did was exist and listen. To my absolute shock, there was no screaming. Absolutely nothing. Some obvious wildlife sounds and nighttime bugs chirping, but nothing unusual or “paranormal.”\n\nThis pissed me off! The one time that I finally had people with me, a support system, and this thing decides not to show up. All of a sudden it doesn’t want to show its ass? No! I don’t think so, it’s going to show. One way or the other. I will make it show itself. I am not leaving tonight without forcing this thing to leave me and go back to where it came from! I’ve been going through hell for far too long and for no good reason. I’m not perfect, but I’m not a killer or some kind of demented narcissist. I live my life and try to not cause any waves in the matrix. This thing has to go. It can’t stay. I have to do something.\n\nTwo whole hours go by and nothing has happened. Something had to be done. So, I did something. I got up from our four-man circle and started calling out to the thing. Challenging it and highlighting what a coward it is. I told it that it’s proven to me that it’s weak. It obviously can’t do what it’s been doing for the past month because of my prayers and the support of my friends. It’s a coward and a weak pathetic creature. I didn’t offer my energy like how some of those “professional” investigators do sometimes. But, I did call it some pretty nasty names. My friends had me binge-watch some reality ghost shows for the past few weeks. A tax to pay for staying at their homes I suppose. It wasn’t terrible. Sometimes they were creepy and at other times they were amusing. But, the real reason for watching was for me to learn some of the basic “Dos and Don’ts” when dealing with the supernatural.\n\nAfter calling the thing out for several minutes, nothing happened. Not exactly what I was expecting. A slight breeze ran down the trail, almost bringing a sign of peace with it. For the first time, I was angry and unnerved by the sheer silence. Something I have been begging for. I almost craved for the screams to come rolling down the trail. Almost prayed for them to come.\n\nThe time was roughly 10:30 pm. Fifteen minutes since my mini meltdown. We decided as a group that two of us should return to the vehicle now and grab the equipment. It was time for us to increase our efforts in search of anything “unnatural.” The other two, with me being one of the two, will stay back and continue to observe the environment without any equipment. Perhaps having fewer people around will provide different results. Maybe the cowardly ghost will show itself finally. This is a common method that paranormal investigators use in the field. Smaller groups. Why it works so well, I have no clue. But, it can be dangerous and result in terrifying results. Maybe the ghostly beings are shy. Perhaps too many humans being in one place at one time blocks their energy. Or limits the extent of their abilities. Just another theory that ghost hunters are seeking a solid answer on.\n\nAs our two friends got further and further away from our initial spot, I felt a change in the air. Like we were being watched or about to be approached by someone. Maybe just being in the dark woods with fewer people around was giving me the heebie-jeebies. Regardless of the reason, I started feeling uneasy for sure. As the other two disappeared around the trail’s bend about 150 ft. away, the show finally began. Almost instantly, rocks and pinecones started pelting me and my friend. Coming out of the thicket to our right. Hitting us in the head and the neck. Whoever or whatever was throwing these objects at us, had perfect aim. Especially for being in the pitch-dark woods with no lights. We jumped up instantly and backed away by at least 15 ft. The objects suddenly stopped being thrown.\n\nThankfully, we had our high-lumen flashlights on us and we flooded the nearby brush. Together, we ran into the brush and out to a clearing that we had found and searched earlier. There was no one around. Not even any animals. At this point, we noticed something odd. All of the natural sounds of the night had stopped. Even the bugs had stopped chirping. It was really weird, now that I come to think about it. As my friend and I searched the area, we noticed a pile of medium-sized rocks and five lines of pinecones neatly placed in the center of the clearing. We had searched this exact area from top to bottom earlier. There was nothing like this here before. We would’ve noticed without a doubt. This was terrifying, and running straight into the woods at night was such a stupid idea. But, at least I wasn’t alone. That helped.\n\nI started walking toward the pile of rocks and the lines of pinecones. I bent down to touch them. Just to inspect them a little further. But, right before I could touch them, the rocks and pinecones blew away before my very eyes. Like there was someone below me scattering everything away in all directions. Making an absolute mess. But, there wasn’t anything below me, and the classic wind theory was out of the window. We were surrounded by brush and there was no wind of any kind. The rocks and the pinecones just flew off the ground in multiple directions. It was horrifying to say the least! Seeing and hearing such a phenomenon happen was not right. It was unnatural. This was for sure unnatural. Yet it was happening. There was nothing physically there to make it happen. The next thing I knew, our flashlights went out. Both of them at the same time. Somehow these brand new batteries died within minutes of being used. It didn’t make sense to me. How? Everything went black. No sounds. No light. No life. Then it happened. The screams. The screams finally returned.\n\nThat shrill blood-curdling scream quickly filled the clearing that we were in. It was zipping around us like there was a surround sound system or something. The way that the sound of the screaming traveled was inhuman. There was no way that a human could move around like that. No way at all! My friend started screaming. I could faintly hear him over the unnatural screams, but I could tell that there was a second scream now. A man’s scream. His screaming was further away than it should have been. Did he try to run away? Am I all alone now? Stuck in the pitch-black woods and surrounded by something evil? I felt hopeless and was petrified! The overwhelming feeling of goosebumps ripping through my body quickly came back. My eyes were full of burning tears. It was terrible. Being attacked and disabled at the same time. I fell to my knees, covered my ears, and started praying. I prayed for forgiveness for when I taunted the “spirit” and I prayed for protection over my friend and me. I kept praying, but I could still hear the screams of that thing raging around me.\n\nAt some point, I felt a cold sharp pain start at my mid-back and slowly crawl up to the back of my neck. It felt sharp, like a knife. It also had a tingling sensation to it, like a low-voltage taser or some kind of electrical instrument. The touch itself didn’t hurt, but the intention felt invasive and threatening. At this point, I freaked out! I screamed out loud, “Get the hell off of me and leave us alone!” “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ! Leave!” Almost instantly, the touch sensation evaporated away, the screaming repelled deep into the woods, and our flashlights started to flicker until becoming a constant ray of light again. It went silent. No more screaming. Thank God.\n\nI found my friend behind me. About 30 ft. away from me. I was shocked to see him that far. How’d he get there? Fear and luck? Panic and instinct? Something didn't seem right. He was lying in the fetal position by a large tree, crying and shaking. I ran over to him and picked him up. I comforted him and told him it was ok now, but that we had to move. We needed to at least get back out on the open trail. This way, we could stand our ground a bit easier and be ready for our friends to return. As I shouldered my friend and we began walking back toward the trail, I noticed he was limping. I also noticed that he had several red slash marks on his neck. Blood was drawn to the surface of his skin, but thankfully no open wounds. I waited until we got back on the trail to ask him what had happened after our lights went out. Once we broke through the tree line, we huddled in the center of the trail and kept our lights on. We consistently flashed the surrounding areas with our lights. Like police officers in a squad car searching for a perp. Everything was still. Everything was silent. A moment to breathe and think. I kept thanking God for that. I turned to my friend and asked what happened to him. He began shaking and rocking in place. He stared off into the woods as he told me what happened, and why he believes it did.\n\nRight after the lights went out, he recalled feeling a similar sharp tingling sensation. Right away. But, the sensation went from his mid-back and down his left leg. Finally, the sensation seemed to wrap around his ankle. He then proceeded to tell me that a tight pressure formed around his ankle and that a sudden twist made him fall on his back. The twist made him yelp in pain. He said that it felt like someone had taken two hammers and smacked both sides of his ankle bone. That they smacked both hammers together at the same time. He said that the pain was so terrible, he believes that he blacked out for a moment. The next thing that he remembers after he came to, was that his left leg was elevated and he was being dragged away from me. He was being dragged off to a nearby tree where he was strung upside down. He swore to me that he was lifted mid-air against that tree. That’s when he began screaming uncontrollably. When I heard him screaming from afar. He said, as he was being suspended upside down, something began to claw at his neck. Over and over and over. Like a cat or a raccoon trying to desperately escape after being cornered. That’s what it felt like to him anyway. What seemed like a lifetime suddenly stopped, and he fell to the ground below the tree. Thankfully, he was not severely hurt during the fall. The next thing he knew, I was picking him up and we were getting out of there.\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was truly thankful that it didn’t get that far with me. Thankfully it didn’t choose to do that to me first. But, I couldn’t help but wonder why. Then he told me why. He said that he was taunting and threatening whatever spirits were around us. Telling them to leave me alone and mess with him instead. He admitted that he went as far as offering up his own energy to whatever was around us. He told it that he was stronger and that it had no control over him. Even with the offering of his spiritual energy. That he was simply more powerful than it was. He also admitted to me, how wrong he was and that he planned on never doing such things again. God willing. I told him that it was ok and that we all have learning curves. We just need to pick a new strategy for when we plan on taking this thing on again. A safer one too.\n\nAbout twenty minutes pass by and our friends finally return with all of our gear. They clearly saw the distraught looks on our faces and asked what had happened. We filled them in on everything. Their response was as expected. Hanging jaws and wide-eyed expressions. They immediately evaluated the area and then us. These were the two friends that were studying demonology. Why we didn’t have one of them stay with us, I have no idea. Lesson learned for sure. Perhaps everything happened the way it was supposed to. So that we’d receive the results that we did. This encounter was needed. Perhaps even planned. By a higher power maybe? But why? It seemed so cruel and dangerous. Maybe there’s a bigger picture to it all that none of us see yet. I don’t know.\n\nAfter checking the area and making sure we were ok, they cleansed us. Something they had not done before, because they didn’t feel ready or confident enough that they could. But, seeing the fear on our faces seemed to have done something to them. It changed them. They became almost like our personal bodyguards. Doing their best to save their friends seemed to become a top priority over everything else. Especially self-criticism. Once we were taken care of, we checked our gear and set everything up in a small circular radius on the trail. These guys have been preparing for a while. Night vision cameras, EMF detectors, DVRs for EVP sessions, traditional battery and laser grid motion detectors, AM/FM radios for high and low-frequency sweeping, and so much more. These guys were ready. Tonight wasn’t just an investigation, it was a fight. A battle. Perhaps that’s what my dream was about. What’s that weird thing called when people have an insight into the future? A premonition!\n\nI’m still on the fence about believing in this stuff, but who knows? These guys were willing to help me get rid of this invisible thing. Whatever it took and however long it takes. I wanted to cry after seeing how devoted and willing they were to help me. I felt like there was hope and that this nightmare was going to end. Suddenly, I didn’t feel forsaken or stuck. As we got everything in place and switched on, we decided that two of us should stay back within the equipment circle, to prevent any theft or outside interference. While the other two go back inside the brush to that clearing. The area that’s been made pretty obvious this thing likes to thrive in. That clearing seems extremely important to this “specter.” I volunteered to go back in with one of our demonologists. I wanted it to be me. It needed to be me. I wanted to be the last thing that this bastard saw before we sent it back to whatever dark hole it crawled out of. Plus, my ankle wasn’t sprained. I also wasn’t as traumatized from the most recent attack. It was only right that I went.\n\nJust as we started to break through the tree line, we heard something in the distance. It was very faint. But, it was growing louder the longer we listened. As the sound got louder, it was clear that it was getting closer. Then I recognized what it was. It was that terrible crashing sound that I heard at the entrance of the park, and it was coming directly toward us. A freight train from hell. Like the screaming, this sound was unnatural. It didn’t sound like a normal train derailing. It was garbled and looping. The longer I listened, it started to sound like a large animal breathing heavily and stampeding in our direction. Whatever it was, it was enough to produce ripples of goosebumps throughout my body again. I started to tear up again too. Just like before. This thing was causing so much discomfort and fear. My body just reacted naturally to this unnatural thing. It was insane. It wasn’t right. Stuff like this isn’t supposed to be real.\n\nMy torment seems to be endless at this point. And I’ve managed to bring three poor souls along with me. They didn’t deserve this any more than I did. They didn’t deserve this at all. They’re just good people trying to help someone in need. Clearly, this thing didn’t care. It simply added them to the list. Whether we were ready or not, shit was about to get real. And it was about to get a lot worse. Worse than any of us could have ever imagined.",

        "text": "I’d brought a dozen of the finest red roses for the occasion, I'd joked to the cashier that they were the very same crimson as freshly spilled blood. She must have thought me weird, but I needed to get my sweetheart these, they were her favourite.\nThough silly me I’d left them on the passenger seat of the car when I had first gotten to the door. I  hurried back to fetch them using my briefcase as a temporary umbrella to protect myself from the rain that was coming down in sheets. \n\nI scowled as I grabbed the bouquet, and made the return trip through the rain to the door. She kept the path and the doorway immaculate, even the window boxes and planters outside were perfectly manicured. This was something I loved about her so much, she loved order as much as I did.\n\r\nMusing to myself, I pictured some nice topiary around the garden and made a mental note to talk to her about that in the morning. It was too late tonight and she would be wanting her beauty sleep, not that she needed it. \n\r\nI tried the door handle and it wasn’t locked. I kept telling her she should lock it before she went to bed but I was glad for once that I didn’t need to find the spare key that was under the ceramic Buddha which guarded the entrance.\n\r\nI opened the door quietly, there was the welcome mat which stated quite clearly, “That strangers were just friends they had not met yet.” I smiled again and wiped my feet. I didn’t want to leave a mess on the pale carpets which covered the downstairs hall and vast open plan lounge. She had picked out tasteful enough decor, not my style. It was there before I met her of course and we hadn’t had chance to have a conversation about changing it. We had so many other things to plan and  to be honest I wasn’t going to bring it up, if it kept her happy then I was happy too. \n\r\nShe liked her boots, all arranged neatly by the door including those boots. The boots she had been wearing when I had first seen her in the bar. They wear long and black, over her knees finishing just below her latex skirt. She had kept these by the door to tease me. I picked one up and inhaled it deeply. I could feel the churning in the pit of my stomach. I loved the way she made me feel and the way the corner of her mouth formed that grin, I knew she felt the same. \n\r\nI thought about picking them up them there and then. I’d rush upstairs and ask her to put them on, I loved the way they looked on her legs, I’d even ask her if she wanted to use the handcuffs she kept in the oak bedside table next to her bed. \r\nI loved these games, but they would wait for now. I put the boot back, making sure they were lined up neatly next to her ankle boots on the rack. Those showed the other side of her , brown and conservative, she wore those when she was at work in the library. She could be the epitome of proper. How she made me laugh when she put on that veneer.\n\r\nI looked at my feet, my own boots were filthy still, even after wiping them. There was thick wet mud coagulating on the sole that I had dragged in from the path outside. She would have hated these. She was such a clean freak, I smiled at that choice of word, I didn’t want to leave footprints on her lovely carpets. I nodded and reached down to push the brown Chelsea boots from my feet and picked them up, making sure to place them as near to the patent leather thigh-highs I loved so much. I nodded with satisfaction for not disturbing her things too much.\r\nI stood up again and headed across the hall to the kitchen just pausing for one moment more to take in those boots again, grinning broadly. I hoped she gotten in my favourite beer, I’d dropped so many hints and really fancied a cold beer before I headed upstairs to see her. \n\r\nJust like the rest of the house the kitchen was pristine and in perfect order.\n\n Everything had its place, I loved how she kept everything so perfect. I kind of hoped she had just left something out of place, some little detail not quite right so I could handcuff her to the bed and spank her. She was naughty too, that would have been just like her...\n\r\nShe often went to bed early, so I’d been creeping around the best I can, this had been made easier since I removed my boots, but when I caught my toe on the corner of the kitchen island I opened my mouth to scream but shut it immediately bottling up the anger inside and swearing in my head furiously. If I had been back in my own apartment I would have turned the air blue and the neighbours would have been knocking on the walls. \n\r\nI composed myself as best I could, still hopping a little as I opened the door of the old fashioned style fridge. It was egg-shell blue with brightly polished chrome. Inside the brightly lit fridge everything was, of course, perfectly in its place. And smack bang in the centre of the middle shelf, a six pack of my favourite beer. And there it was, her one little error, there was one removed, she’d had one of those beers herself the naughty girl. She was going to get punished for that.\n\r\nI stopped for a second and reached for the beer but paused and stood back up straight. I shook my head, a beer could wait until after we had had our perfect night together. I looked at the blood red roses on the counter, they could wait too until we’d done.\n\r\nI managed to keep quiet as I crept upstairs. I wanted to leave the surprise until the very last second. It worked, she didn’t wake up until the latch on the bedroom door clicked. \n\nYou should have seen the look on her face as she saw me.\n\r\n“Who the hell are you?” \n\r\nShe screamed, as she tried to back away pressing herself up against the headboard. She wasn’t going to get away from me. \n\r\nThe cleaner found her body the next day, handcuffed spread eagled, face down on the bed. She’d struggled so much that I had unfortunately had to resort to the bottle of chloroform I kept in my jacket.  I’d left my mark though and carved the word naughty onto her back with my penknife. It was what she deserved. I told you I would punish her. \n\r\nThe police found my empty beer bottle in the trash. I’d sat quietly after we had enjoyed our evening, making sure to clean up after myself. She would have appreciated that, I did owe her that much. We had such fun that I made sure to put those blood-red roses in a vintage vase next to the bed. They also noticed that one of her thigh high boots was missing. It sits in pride of place in my growing collection.\r\n\nPlease feel free to enjoy and comment. This is the first story I've chosen to share and one of the faves I've written.",

        "text": "Just a foreword before I get into this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil last year I was not a believer in \"manifesting your thoughts\", despite this fact I'd regularly buy self-help books on everything from beating and understanding addictions to organising or restructuring my future and mind set even when this included books on manifesting our future through thought.\n\nI've had a while to think about this now and perhaps this journey of improving myself required me to ultimately experience this event to change my opinion on the manifestation of our thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe start of this experience begins young for me at my first sleepover at the age of 13, the night went on as I imagined most sleep-overs or slumber parties do at this age, lots of sweets, video games, and conversations beyond our years and no sleep, \n\neventually, as the night turned to early morning and the conversation dwindled a small suggestion would lead to a thought that still to this day, maybe even more so now, plagues most of my waking thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe turned off the lights and sat in a circle passing a single torch to the speaker each time as we recited scary stories and tried to terrify each other as much as possible, one or two excused themselves visibly shaken by twisted stories poorly recited from memory, none of which I can recall today except one.\n\nOne story which seemingly followed me from childhood to young adulthood finally manifested itself in reality last December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to 2022, I'm getting over a breakup that as much as the name suggests broke me and I was seeking help from anyone with confidence in their beliefs which lead me to a discord group of individuals seeking to improve their lives.\n\nI shared my opinions and what information I had parsed from the many books on the subject I had already read and piqued the interest of a July, a late 20s nonbinary who was studying to become a psychiatrist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spoke for months gradually moving from conversations of intrigue to deep conversations of past and future, it became obvious to everyone we were moving towards something serious in August of the same year and we made it official just weeks later and within days we were traveling between each other's house to spend the night together, every night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt like a piece of me I had been searching for was found but this was only to last for around 4 months, the relationship was perfect during this time I simply had no complaints, felt heard, and not just appreciated but needed for the first time in a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some reason a conversation occurred before we had been in a relationship or as far as I was aware we were interested in each other that July had never quite dropped;\n\nWe spoke about recurring thoughts, like those you experience late in the deep of night, not wanting to reveal my deepest thoughts I opted to tell them of the scary story that had never left my thoughts from the moment it was spoken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the moment I manifested the biggest mistake in my life which has altered every aspect of my life since. I no longer discuss desires, thoughts, or feelings with anyone and I am beyond scared to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up around 3 in the morning; I've never been able to sleep through the night so thought nothing of this but realised July wasn't asleep next to me which I found odd as I would happily, maybe creepily, observe July until I fell asleep again almost every night,\n\nI could hear the sound of the taps running and just assumed they had used the bathroom when they came back into the room and put their cold hands against my chest before they fell asleep again looking incredibly cute and content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I lay there, smiling and observing each pore in July's face one of my cats came into the room and snuggled into me, wet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't heard any rain and in the low light thought that his fur was covered in slick red oil I decided I would bath him, and as I carried him in protest to the bathroom, something felt off, all the hairs on the back of my neck raised,\n\nthe recurring thought of the scary story became fixed in my mind but having experienced this feeling many times I shrugged it off, firmly turned off the sink taps then held Kat in the bathtub as I rinsed him off with a jug of water and some cat shampoo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed it wasn't washing away and the dripping sound hadn't stopped but had become more consistent; \n\nI pulled out my phone and turned the flashlight, as I had been relying on the hallway light due to the light in the bathroom being broken, to find the offending drip and work out what was in Kat's fur when it became apparent we were covered in blood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy bathroom was covered in blood too and nailed to the ceiling, dripping all over me, was my beautiful ginger cat Mango.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story I had heard at this sleepover was a rendition of \"The Licked Hand\", I confronted July who denied it, and when police investigated they found the back door had been left unlocked and told me it was not proof nor significant evidence when I told them I had lost the key to the back door weeks prior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManifestation is real but sometimes it's not us who makes it happen.",
