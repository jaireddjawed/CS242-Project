You may have come across some of my content on YouTube, from performances in concert halls, to playing for horses, to collabs with artists like Sting and TwoSet.\n\nIf you’re a musician or ever played/practiced an instrument, you’ll know that there’s no better feeling in the world than getting to sing or play your heart out and share that moment with others. However, the preparation and practice that’s required to get there is tough and often lonely. Even if your goal is to be able to play just one song for your friends at the beach, most people will give up before they’re able to get there. How do you motivate yourself to persevere?\n\nFor the past 18 months, I’ve been working on a platform called [Tonic](https://www.jointonic.com/) that makes practice fun and inspires people to share their artistry through live and social practice rooms. It’s helped many people from beginners to those who hadn’t touched an instrument in over 10 years, come back and relive the joy of music.\n\nIf you’d like to give it a go, [check it out here](https://tonicmusic.app/practice). \n\nFrom practicing, to performance, to life on tour, AMA!\n\nPROOF: [https://imgur.com/AitMBcm](https://imgur.com/AitMBcm)",

Common health risks include cancer, heart disease, alcohol abuse, PTSD, and burnout. My newest book is “The UFF Book of Wisdom.” It tackles such questions as: What makes being a firefighter the best job in the world? What does being fit for duty mean, and how is it achieved? Are firefighters destined for disease, depression, and burnout? These are the types of issues I want to talk about today. \n\nOutside of writing, I coach firefighters, strength train and sauna 5x a week, and live with my wife and Pitbull Mastiff.\n\nI’m excited to be here today and answer any questions Reddit may have.

        "text": "Hello everyone, my name is Hoang.\n\nI just transferred the last order for my \"kids backpack\" project. My products have reached out to customers from 20 countries. It took 3 years to conquer our goal, but for me, this requires a bloody effort with…a little luck. And I’m here to share with you guys about my experience and hope this can motivate you to pursue your dreams.\n\n# In the last 5 years I:\n\n* quit my job in the Online Industry with 10 years of in-depth research on User Experience\n* opened my own backpack shop\n* designed my own [backpack for kids](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinipak/lightest-ergonomic-school-backpack-for-kids-by-the-father?ref=discovery&amp;term=tinpak)\n\nEverything started when I couldn’t find a suitable backpack for my son on his first day at school. And the idea is to make a kid’s backpack that is both light and durable with ergonomically designed to help children avoid back pain.\n\nActually, the idea has been with me for 2 years but I didn't know where should to start. Fortunately, I found two members with experience in 3D design who were interested in my ideas to make a team of 3.\n\nIn November 2018, after making sure that we will start up, we operated in a small room as an office, called PAK DESIGN. And after goodbye to the Online industry, working for more than ten years, I spent full time on product design.\n\n# Summarize the first project’s journey:\n\n* It took us 15 months to create 10 different versions. But with creativity, we continue to face obstacles when the design of things goes far from the available molds, leading to difficulties in implementation. Many things accrue at enormous costs, and our finance cannot afford them. Our team broke down because of losing faith in success.\n* After calmed down, I think we need to start from the basics first. We selected ideas that have been researched for more than one year, applied to develop in the small market first, and Tinipak was born for launching in Vietnam.\n* Realized that Kickstarter is a big opportunity to make my dream come true, we set a new goal for the Team, implemented the points to update for the global version. However, they only support 25 countries, and Vietnam isn't listed. Got me 3 months to go through all the procedures to get their approval. We have passed through a very narrow door. Fortunately, [the project is fully funded](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinipak/lightest-ergonomic-school-backpack-for-kids-by-the-father?ref=discovery&amp;term=tinipak).\n* We started production. But damn, the epidemic outbreak, anxious when everything is behind schedule, I had to struggle a while to find a new manufacturer.\n* Damn x2: We discovered that the pink packages were not up to standard, so we had to send them back for the factory to do it again.\n* Damn x3 Our first exported packages were listed in the Red Channel for clearance and had to unload the boxes for customs inspection.\n* Overcoming everything, when the last orders from Europe were finally transferred, I was so relieved that WE ACTUALLY DID IT.\n\nMy proof from packaging to receiving customer feedback [1](https://postimg.cc/kD1SBMsK) [2](https://postimg.cc/5Q0FnD4X) [3](https://postimg.cc/bs4296Kv) [4](https://postimg.cc/XpP9DNy4) \n\nLots of work to do but thanks for still getting it done. I feel quite proud when my little son said he has the coolest backpack in the class.\n\n# About my start-up - [Tinipak](https://www.tinipak.net/the-story-of-tinipak)\n\nI want to have a name that when people hear, they will immediately recognize the characteristics of that product that is suitable for many purposes but still has to be the most compact. So I took the name “Tini”. Currently, I still try my best to make the best products for our kids with latest project [TiniBag](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinipak/the-lightest-and-most-versatile-everyday-bag-for-kids?ref=78w55d) fixing kids’ problem forgetting their stuff at school. Combo help kids to go to school conveniently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My proof (I will post a tweet). Thanks for reading and please AMA!*",

We have been to games in 10+ countries / 4 continents and now spend all our spare time every week finding best ways to travel Europe from the UK to watch matches.\n\nIt's nothing overly complicated but we now have a pretty comprehensive understanding of how to watch football in any major European country, how much it will cost, the chances of getting general sale tickets, the chances of needed to pay a tout for tickets, how long before a game tickets will be released, what cities you can fly between for games from the UK, and basically anything else on the topic so AMA.\n\nSome of our best ever fixtures have included (Flight + Ticket): Inter Milan v Sassuolo (£17), Gladbach v Leipzig (£37), Porto v Famalicao (£35), AC Milan v Liverpool (£51) and Napoli v Barcelona (£56).\n\nWe have grown from sending emails to a few friends to over 60,000+ active users in the last 15 months, hopefully saving people time and money along the way. You can check out our website here if interested: [https://www.euroticketclub.com/](https://www.euroticketclub.com/)\n\n**Proof:** [We have included proof on at the end of the about section on the website](https://www.euroticketclub.com/)\n\n**Other proof:** [A tweet about todays AMA](https://twitter.com/euroticketclub/status/1622684574105960453?s=20&amp;t=OjQ6bZg6uHRypw53aOCoDA)",

It's important to remember that no one is perfect, and that everyone has their own unique quirks and imperfections. The key to finding a lasting and fulfilling relationship is to find someone who you are compatible with, who shares your values and goals, and who supports and loves you for who you are.\n\nThe search for the perfect match may involve trying different dating methods, meeting new people, and experiencing a few heartbreaks along the way. However, it's important to keep an open mind and a positive outlook. With patience and persistence, you will eventually find someone who meets your needs and who you can build a strong and loving relationship with.\n\nOpen communication and understanding can make all the difference in making a relationship work. So when you think about your partner, do they make you feel like the best version of yourself? If so, that is a good sign.\n\nYou're never going to know 100%, so don't be afraid to take a leap of faith.\n\n**Proof**: [https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTRGyKsxH/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTRGyKsxH/?fbclid=IwAR3DMwV25ZsgYQ3rp5GqC4IP6oO4IetRZkdzDuqRUX7Itq5bqRrk8XtIsgc)",

Here also is [the sign](https://ibb.co/KKmYDdS) I display when collecting cash and items on the street in Lviv. My name is Rick Moody. You can search my last name, Муді, at http://court.gov.ua/fair. \n\nI've been through a long ordeal in prison (over 4.5 years actually in) , and I've been over seven years overseas without break, homeless too, and now I am living since February 1st in a friend's basement, staying warm at least. \n\nLuda, Alla, and Lana are on a beach in Mexico, living in a circle with 300 other female inmates, adjacent the \"prison\" near Tijuana. The sky and date there were frozen last year at April 18. *** Such is the power of the computer which literally runs the universe. *** April 19 marked five years since the beginning of my ordeal. \n\nThe sky in Mexico turned permanently overcast in June. At Brygidki  prison, they were being unkind to me. \n\nEvery night since April my friends in Mexico hold hands in a circle from 7:15pm to 7:45pm. Steve Martin, Jay Leno, the filmmaker Miranda July, and a friend of mine from a long time ago in Munich, Tara Keating, are there with them. Holding hands, as I told them in a short speech read by Mr. Martin, will just be our way of staying together; they are not trying to \"make it happen\" (I can go back and edit this even though it was read ten months ago). USS Metallica 89 is out there in the ocean in front of them too. At night, the ocean and the beach (except their circle) illuminate under an invisible sun. The other three hundred woman are Mexican and foreign women working for CIA, and a year from now they will be returning for a party with us. \n\nFebruary 4th 7:45pm marked the six month mark of my living on the street in Lviv. On January 26th, it occured to me release must be imminent (or soon), probably on or before February 4th, so I sent Miranda and friends a message through the embassy about my release date and homelessness, which they knew not, and I said February 4th 7:45pm, but I also had the guy tell the actual release date and 7:45pm. \n\nI drank some of my favorite one-dollar vodka and went chanting \"Tuesday\" out of synch with the choir at a Russian Orthodox cathedral I happen to stumble by every day. I left before trouble, a good Samaratin gave me the signal. \n\nMy friends in Mexico received this email from the embassy on January 26th at 3:00pm. Then I turned the skies clear again, beginning at 7:15pm which as I said is the time the 307 begins their circle on a beach. \n\n\"As I believe you are aware, he is still confined inside a computer simulation. The person he is with has given no indication when he will be released from this simulation. Eric is therefore going on his own belief that this will occur at the six month mark, February 2nd 7:45pm. I am authorized to tell you what I know: February 5th 7:45pm is the actual release date. Don't do anything different. Just be with me.\" \n\nAt the moment power comes on (Unofficial Power On), the Blue Angels make a supersonic low-level fly by over the beach. A Grease Lightning courier drops out of a parachute on the beach delivering telegram. Power comes on at midnight. \n\nAt the moment of UPO, an Army Black Hawk picks me up wherever I am. I will spend the night at a local hotel and leave by Portal Ray the following day. This gives me a day to review everything, removing decision making mostly from this. \n\nI am getting ready to sail.",
