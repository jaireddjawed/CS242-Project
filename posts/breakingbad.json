If Hank were left to believe that the deceased Gale was Heisenberg, so much unnecessary misery and difficulty could have been avoided. No one else in the DEA or Abq police gave a shit about Heisenberg besides Hank and they would be happy to consider the matter closed. At minimum, Walt\u2019s (and Gus\u2019s) legal exposure would have diminished enormously, so the conflict with Gus might have been managed without becoming as lethal as it did.\n\nWalt\u2019s indiscretion sprang directly from one of his preexisting character flaws- his resentment at being undervalued and unrecognized.

Personally, I feel terrible for a genius like Walter having to live in absurdity. With all the contribution Walter made to the chemistry field then he should've gotten the admiration and respect of other's. But Walter's students barely respect him, his boss treated him with contempt and even Hank, although he didn't mean harm, also humiliated Walter from time to time. We have to understand that Walter was always a person of high ego, the biggest example of this was when he left the company he started, Graymatter just because of his fragile ego over his ex-girlfriend. But in order to provide for his family, Walter had to endure the pain of having his pride damaged but when he knew he had cancer, Walter could finally unleash his ego and went to the meth cooking industry, his products reached record breaking impurity and as the show goes on, Walter White had to pay for his high pride.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1: Your ego hurts those around you**, **even your loved one**\n\nAt the start of the show, Walter had the perfect excuse for his crime which is \"I'm doing this for my family\", but the mighty truth is that he did all of that to satisfy his ego which was constraint for a long time. Even though the path he took brought him money and fame but it came with the cost of hurting his loved one. Because of his path to \"glory\", he ignored how he had damaged the people he loved mentally like Skyler, his son and even Jesse who  he views as his very son. With Jesse initially, it was a stable relationship. Walter loved Jesse like his son and Jesse loved Walter just like his father, that's why he always want the recognition and praises from his master but because of his ego, Walter never looked straight into the strengths of Jesse. Walter always criticize Jesse for what he did wrong and this lead to Jesse losing all hope for Walter and turning them both into enemies.\n\n**2: Your ego will kill your conscience and humanity**\n\nAt the start of the show, when his pride wasn't unleashed, Walter kept his conscience in place. At the start, Walter had to take a very long time before killing Krazy-8, someone who could very much kill Walter's own family and Walt was disgusted when he did it. But as the show went on, Walter's humanity began to fade away, he wasn't afraid of letting Jane, Jesse's girlfriend died and led to the plane crash killing hundreds of people. At the end of the show, Walter even killed 10 people at the same time in order to keep his identity safe. This cruelness is so big that even Hank, who frequently faces death and criminals became haunted over Walter's actions.\n\n**3: Your pride will lead you to make mistake**\n\nAs the show continues and with loads of money made, Walter ego began to take over and he always thought he was at the center with no opponents. This had led him to make many mistakes that brought dangers to him and his family. Even the way Walter was exposed was also because of his pride when Hank found Gale's poem book in the bathroom and realizing that Walter was Heisenberg. To Walter, Gale was just a small victim who could not bring any danger to him. The peak of Walter's mistake was when he had to witness Jack killing Hank. With all the interaction Walter had with Jack, his pride must've made him think that if he say something, Jack would listen which simply is not the truth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrough Walter White and the show Breaking Bad, it is important that we learn to never let our pride and ego take over. Even though it's tempting to show your worth, too much of it could really harm you and your loved ones.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678547801.0},{"title":"Statue in Albuquerque","author":"mirh577","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingbad\/comments\/11oujkc\/statue_in_albuquerque\/","text":"Not about show, but has anyone been to the statue in Albuquerque?

However, by the time of s5 he is starting to become ill again without going into remission.

HOLY F**KING SHIT !!!","author":"AlienwareSLO","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingbad\/comments\/11kgyyy\/10_years_too_late_to_the_party_but_finally\/","text":"Hey, I wanted to share my thoughts on Breaking Bad after recently watching it for the first time (I actually just finished the last episode yesterday). I was always aware of the show's existence but never really gave it a chance during its original run. I was more of a Dexter fan at the time and I almost saw Breaking Bad as a sort of rival to it. In hindsight, I'm really glad that I was able to experience it for the first time with a more mature set of eyes (I'm 29).\n\nHowever, despite my initial reluctance, I managed to stay completely spoiler-free for the past decade because I always kind of figured that I'd give it a chance one day. All I knew was the basic tagline synopsis of Bryan Cranston's character getting into the drug business due to a cancer diagnosis.\n\nSo it wasn't until my girlfriend suggested we start watching the show a couple of months ago that I finally gave in. And boy, am I glad I did. The pilot episode got me hooked, but the moment I realized I was watching something truly special was in episode 5 of the first season, \"Gray Matter.\" The scene where the characters discuss Walt's choice with the talking pillow was absolutely incredible, with stellar performances from the entire cast.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, I pretty much universally loved all the characters from the show. As someone who's a sucker for exploring anti-hero characters, I have to say that Cranston's portrayal of Walt was lightning-in-a-bottle type of acting. His character was tragic, maniacal, and comical all at once. Aaron Paul as Jesse was equally impressive in his range. I never expected to see his character go in the direction that he did. I'm gonna have to watch that movie with him as the central character that I just learned about today.\n\nAnna Gunn's performances as Skyler were often a highlight for me, especially during emotionally charged scenes. I've read some complaints that she is bitch, which I didn't get at all. She brought so much depth and complexity and was completely believable IMHO.\n\nThen there's Hank. A true man's man and I love him for it. He always cracked jokes and had a tough exterior, but you could tell he had a big heart. He just didn't always have the vocabulary to express it. Just such a likable dude, you'd just wanna have him around on a boy's night or something like that. And his wife Marie may have been weird, but she had some brilliant moments of being the most reasonable person in the room. Especially during the previously mentioned taking pillow scene when she took the words out of my mouth and said that it should be Walt's own choice regarding his treatment.\n\nThen there was the BRILLIANT Saul, and Mike that reminded me of Winston Wolf from Pulp Fiction (\"I solve problems\"), and my suave hermano Gus with 200 IQ business acumen and fearsome calm demeanor. And let's not forget Jesse's lovable sidekicks, or Beavis and Butthead as I've come to call them. Also dumb and dumber.\n\nAnyway, I could go on and on, but my thoughts are still racing, so I'll just say that I can't believe how this show continually got better and better. The final season was amazing and the last 4 episodes were out of this world.\n\nBreaking Bad lived up to the hype for me, even after all these years. If you're like me and somehow missed out on it during its original run, I highly recommend giving it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n\nOne more thing worth mentioning. This show made me cry, but it also often made me laugh as much as, if not more, than any sitcom I've ever watched. This all culminated in the \"Crawl Space\" episode when I was laughing hysterically with Walter at the absurdity of the whole situation. Just incredible.\n\nIt is now cemented as my favorite show of all time, bar none.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678143233.0},{"title":"Peek-a-Boo S2 E6","author":"NeetStreet_2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingbad\/comments\/11lb3cb\/peekaboo_s2_e6\/","text":"   Watching the series for the second time and just finished this episode.

Proof that beating the shit out of people multiple times really does work.\n\nSkyler: Bitch, but I started to see where she was coming from. Minus points for her singing. \n\nHank: Would love to have a beer with him but spends too much time talking about rocks. I mean minerals.\n\nMarie: Easily the most annoying character on the show in the early seasons but I felt she really grew as the show went on and I felt something close to empathy for her whilst she was helping with Hank's recovery. Award for most improved.\n\nWalt Jr: Pretty consistent, loves breakfast, hates everything else. Higher points in later seasons when he's becoming more aware of what's going on.\n\nMike: Like your grandpa that fought in World War II Mike has seen a lot of shit and done a lot of shit but ultimately just likes putting his feet up, watching TV and spending time with his grandkids.

On Season 3 now and just enjoying the uniqueness of it. Any popular show is going to get critics so sometimes I like to review it from a critical perspective after so many years, and while the earlier seasons do \"seem\" to have some slow points and camera imperfections, when the big moments hit with the perfect direction, editing, and writing, they just erase all of the slow stuff.\n\nFor example, season 2 can plod along as if it is going nowhere for a while after Grilled, but once the latter episodes arrive, it immediately becomes a captivating show where you can't miss a scene.\n\nThis is the \"gradual\" buildup that makes Breaking Bad great because that's the point: you don't see it coming, but when the good episodes and scenes come, they make all of the slower episodes make sense and it makes you realize where it's going. That's what I love about Breaking Bad; it does have slow weak spots that make you question how good it is, but all of the sudden, it spins out these incredibly great episodes and scenes, or acting scenes, that totally engross you more than any other show, like when Jane finally shows her true colors and succumbs to her addiction, the shit gets real.\n\nThis is the first time I've watched the show in at least 4 years so it's as close as you can get to erasing your memory and watching it all again for the first time for me. Just for comparison, I'm currently enjoying the show Yellowstone, which is \"very good\", but it's just not as tightly plotted and written as Breaking Bad is. I'm rerealizing that it is Breaking Bad's tight, easily accessible, streamlined plot centralized on the main character's character development that makes it stand out and above the rest of top tier shows.\n\nAnd this is long before everyone knows that the greatest scenes and seasons are still to come.

But holy shit, he's evil. And not in the caricatural notion of evil where he does all this unprovoked bad stuff just to be bad. We see where his morals lie, protecting Jesse, protecting his family, all on top of protecting himself (although, side note, sometimes I wonder if he genuinely cares about Jesse as a person or if Jesse's just his security blanket at this point).\n\nHe's not a hero though, he is not a role-model character, people that look up to Heisenberg are so weird to me. There are tons of examples of his evildoings like watching Jane die & sending Jesse to off Gale, just a couple off the top of my head.\n\nBut what's interesting to me is that everyone seems to forget when he raped Skyler?? Like I get it she's annoyed the majority of fans (I personally don't find her likeable but her character could've been worse, I mean she *was* down to be Walt's partner in crime essentially) but that scene was so wretched, I dropped the show twice because of that episode (granted I'm glad I stuck it through because of the masterpiece that is the writing) but given that we were barely two seasons in, so we're still being introduced to the villain that is Heisenberg, I couldn't get behind rooting for a protagonist like this. That scene made me sick, I'm honestly shocked that people just brush it aside when discussing his character. This isn't like Hank's mistreatment of Marie due to his injury, Walter White's has the capacity of rape within him, plain and simple. I refuse to believe I'm alone in this. Literally the scene is sickening, I had to skip that episode and read a synopsis to carry on with the show. \n\nI vaguely understand, what he did to Skyler doesn't compare to murder but why does this incident get brushed off so often??\n\nAnyway.

Now I\u2019ll break down the characters and why their sins shouldn\u2019t have been forgotten.  \n \n\n**Skyler White** \u2013 Convinced White to go through the Leukaemia process *(or whatever it was, sorry.)* without giving a second thought of the financial struggle. It\u2019s true that a life should be taken priority over money, but money can tear down families for present and future generations as well. Walter knew the consequences which is why he was first set against it, however he thought of his own way into making money from which apparently saddened Skyler more than ever upon realising where it was coming from. She feared her family would be set in danger and yet she decided to get involved in this matter by becoming the laundry boss. It was ironic when Skyler cheated White with Ted because I\u2019m pretty sure it was the \u201cfeel alive\u201d thing she wanted as well and her birthday song made me question that she had a thing for him before the meth shenanigans. Oh yeah and who needs evidence, White Killed Hank because everyone thinks and says so and White wanted him dead, yes. So therefore trying to kill White with a knife justifies everything.  And let\u2019s not forget her trying to kill herself and smoking while being pregnant. Yeah, what a great wife and mother she is.  \n \n\n**Jesse Pinkman** \u2013 his character development makes almost no sense. Starts as a street junkie and abandons his first group *(like, poof gone, not a single thought of that gang)*, becomes once again Walter\u2019s student, develops into a drug addict, is convinced by White to start rehabilitating. Somewhere along the lines is betrayed by his own family who give focus more to his younger brother. A similar aged kid also kills one of his close gang members, but FOR SOME REASON cannot stand when a kid gets murdered. Dude, I would despise children at this point, plus that\u2019s how cartels work man, get over it, you two with White committed murder from the very beginning and somehow towards the end does you don\u2019t want to accept blood money anymore? \u201cI\u2019ll just hang around with Mike, surely that hitman is a completely innocent guy.\u201d Then he turns against White who became the next Gus, forgetting every time White saved his life.\u201d He had his chance to start a new life but for the sake of plot rather common sense, nope, got to expose White for what he is even though Jesse didn\u2019t really do jack shit against Gus and left it all to White to retaliate. 10\/10, would recommend to another partner.  \n \n\n**Hank Schrader** \\- Do me a favour and bring a law expert here, you\u2019d be amazed how many times this guy breaks them.  Forging evidence? Not a problem if it\u2019s honest police work. And speaking of work, what a great working guy, so great that he\u2019s been called an A-hole numerous times by his pal Gomez. *(I\u2019ll be honest, I thought that Gomez would turn against him at one point\u2026.)*. Very dedicated husband to Marie, so great that he\u2019ll turn a blind eye every time she steals something. Clear example how you\u2019re willing to forgive every mischief when it comes to your beloved ones, except if you happen to be Heisenberg\u2026  \n \n\n**Marie Schrader** \u2013 A kleptomaniac without a shred of guilt. Never even considered apologizing or at least admitting stealing the tiara that almost got Skyler facing prison. \u201cWhat, Walter White is part of a cartel? Oh no, that must be so horrible, I got to take Skyler\u2019s baby away without her consent!\u201d  \n \n\n**Walter White** \u2013 Adding him because his character development is also flawed. Season 4 ended, Gus is dead, Walter White is not forced to cook anymore, so he quit, settled back to live with his family happily ever after. The end.  \nSike, season 5, Walter White wants to cook again because what, makes him feel alive? You\u2019ve suffered through 4 seasons, got more money than you can spend and now you want to put your family in danger again?

After the death of his wife, Skyler, and the collapse of his drug empire, Walter found himself alone and in need of a new partner. He approached Fring with a proposal - they should join forces and take over the entire drug trade in New Mexico.\n\nFring was skeptical at first, but he saw the potential in Walter. Together, they started working on a new recipe for their signature blue meth, one that was even more potent and addictive than before. The profits began pouring in, and their business grew stronger every day.\n\nAs their partnership flourished, Walter began to see Fring in a new light. He admired his intelligence, his discipline, and his unwavering loyalty to his employees. And, surprisingly, he found himself developing feelings for him. He realized that he had fallen in love with Gustavo Fring.\n\nAt first, Walter was hesitant to act on his feelings. He was afraid that Fring would reject him or worse, betray him. But as time went on, he couldn't deny his attraction any longer. One day, he gathered the courage to confess his love to Fring, who was taken aback but intrigued.\n\nAfter some hesitation, Fring agreed to give their relationship a chance. They started dating in secret, meeting up in private and keeping their feelings hidden from the world. But as their bond grew stronger, they knew that they couldn't keep it a secret forever.\n\nOne day, Walter proposed to Fring, and they decided to get married in a small ceremony. It was a quiet affair, attended only by a few close friends and family members. But to Walter and Fring, it was the happiest day of their lives.\n\nTheir marriage brought them even closer together, and they became the ultimate power couple in the drug world. With their combined expertise, they were unstoppable. But their love was not meant to last.\n\nOne day, while on a business trip, Fring was assassinated by one of his rivals. Walter was devastated by the loss of his beloved husband and vowed to avenge his death. He went on a rampage, taking out anyone who was responsible for Fring's murder. It was a violent and bloody affair, and Walter knew that he had crossed a line.\n\nIn the end, Walter was consumed by his desire for revenge, and his empire crumbled around him. He was eventually caught by the authorities and sentenced to life in prison. But even in his cell, he never forgot his love for Gustavo Fring and the brief but intense happiness that they had shared together.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1677804405.0},{"title":"I Would Love it if Breaking Bad got an MCU-Style \"What-if\" Show.

The RV was destroyed which means there\u2019s no evidence for the DEA. \n2. He had about $80,000 cash plus the full amount of money he made from his own deal with Gus. (Walter gave him the half he received at Saul\u2019s office so he likely had a total of $100-$200k cash.) \n3. Jesse was in the clear from the legal perspective as he was brutally assaulted by Hank. DEA probably had nothing to pursue him further and I\u2019m sure all attention shifted to the twins who tried to kill Hank. \n4. He had purchased his parents house for $400k from the money they made in the first deal with Gus. I think they both made $480k each. This house was also actually worth $800k since he bought it half price. \n\nI think Jesse could have made a clean exit and moved on from his lifestyle considering he had nearly a $1,000,000 in assets to his name.

His kill count incresaed very slowly, and I feel like people don't talk about that much, Krazy 8, Gale B, Gus, Inmates, etc. We know some of these were neccesary but at the same time, he took so many lives just for him to be safe\/alive. \n\nSecond of all, I feel like people watching the show didn't notice how Walter was changing, and how he turned into a villian. Again, when he first started I was rooting for him against Tuco and Krazy-8 and I noticed I was rooting for him until I finished Felina. People liked him becuase he was against Killer Drug Dealers and trying to take them down, but looking at it, *Walter* turned into a Killer Drug Dealer that basically \"never got taken down.\" \n\nHe is a big factor on why Jesse's life got ruined and so many other people's. He even poisoned a little kid to save himself and manipulate Jesse. Sure, maybe he did pick the right amount of Lilly of the Valley, but does that really matter? He poisoned a little kid so he could kill somebody and manipulate his friend. \n\nHe also kept on saying \"I'm doing this for my family\" and we can see at the end he said \"I did this for me. I liked it. It brang me pleasure\" or something along the lines which is pretty messed up. Im not talking about Cooking Meth, im talking about killing people to be able to cook meth afterwards and be a high value target. He always wanted NO threat\/risk to his family when at the same time, every action he took allowed his family to be visited by the Grim Reaper. \n\nHe also did have some affection towards Jesse but it was rarely shown (\"If you kill Jesse, you don't have me\"), he killed Jesse's friend (Mike) FOR NO REASON, JUST because he got his feelings hurt by Mike who was spitting straight facts to Walter (\"It could have ran like clockwork\"), and he even noticed for just a LITTLE bit about what mistake he made and just said \"Oh I killed Mike. Ok.\" And moved forward, he *barely* took any time to even think about \"Why did I kill him?\" \n\nHe watched Jane die just because Jane requested Jesse's share of money. Sure Jane liked Jesse because of drugs and money, but at the same time, if you have a partner who has a loved one dying, you try to help them. Not watch them die. People were saying he didn't have much to do with the crash and were blaming it on Jesse, when in my opinion, Walter was the #2 reason for the crash. Possibly #1 if you REALLY argue about it. \n\nOver time Mike was right about Walter. His ego, his stupid decisions, and his stupid bravery led for Walter to be a reason so many people died, led for his family to fall apart and even die (Hank) and for his own Son to hate him, JUST because he liked it for his own benefit.

However, his life took a drastic turn when he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, leaving him with only a few months to live.\n\nAs a result, Mr. White was faced with the daunting task of figuring out how to provide for his family after he was gone. His meager teacher's salary would not be enough to support them, and he knew that he needed to find a way to make some quick cash.\n\nWith his extensive knowledge of chemistry, Mr. White began to cook crystals - a highly addictive and dangerous drug - in the hopes of selling it for a profit. At first, he was hesitant to break the law, but his desperate need for money outweighed his moral compass.\n\nThings were going smoothly for a while, and Mr. White was able to make enough money to provide for his family. However, his luck soon ran out when he found himself in trouble with an evil gang who were also involved in the drug trade.\n\nThe gang demanded that Mr. White work for them, using his chemistry skills to cook more drugs and increase their profits. Terrified for his life and the safety of his family, Mr. White reluctantly agreed to work for them.\n\nAs the weeks passed, Mr. White's situation became increasingly dire. He was forced to work long hours and endure constant threats from the gang members, who were always watching him. He became consumed by fear and paranoia, and the guilt of what he was doing weighed heavily on his conscience.\n\nDespite the danger, Mr. White refused to give up. He was determined to provide for his family, no matter the cost. However, his actions eventually caught up with him, and he found himself in a dangerous showdown with the gang.\n\nIn the end, Mr. White was able to outsmart his enemies and come out on top. He was able to secure a safe future for his family, but at a great cost. He had sacrificed his own morality and integrity in the process, and he knew that he would carry the weight of his actions with him for the rest of his life.\n\nAs Mr. White lay dying in a hospital bed, he reflected on his life and the choices he had made. He realized that, in the end, it was not the money or the power that mattered, but the love and connections he had forged with the people he cared about. He hoped that, despite his mistakes, his family would remember him for the kind and caring teacher he had always been, rather than the criminal he had become","upvote_ratio":0.54,"created_utc":1677572931.0},{"title":"Met R.J Mitte today and he was amazing and super friendly!

I unfortunately spoiled it for myself before hand, so I sort of knew was what coming.\n\nI had perused a bunch of Reddit threads & other discussion boards. There was seemingly a lot of agreement with Mike when he went off on Walter shortly before his death, regarding his ego & pride.\n\nOutside of season 5, I really didn\u2019t see most of Walt\u2019s actions that way. I actually hard disagree with Mike. Hot take coming in, but Mike dying in the middle of nowhere, broke & alone was too good a death for him.\n\nAnyways, as far as walt himself, most of his actions were fairly sound, to me at least, most of the first few seasons.\n\nSeason 1 he was forced into killing Krazy 8 & the other guy for obvious reasons. He was in way over his head. Tuco was another fan of worms entirely. Jesse warned him about it, but he was blinded by the $. \n\nSeason 2 Jesse warned him again about expanding the territory, but Walt didn\u2019t listen. Definitely some ego there. I see alot of people say he let Jane die to manipulate Jesse, but i really saw it as saving Jesse more than anything else. Walt definitely truly cared for Jesse. \n\nWhich bring us to season 3 & mike\u2019s point\u2026 Walt was happy cooking for Gus. He even told Jesse he was being greedy when Jesse questioned them getting paid only $3M when they were cooking $96M worth of meth. (The 3 month contract I believe) Walt wasn\u2019t trying to usurp Gus. He even called Gus to set Jesse straight as a final Hail Mary. Walt deferred to Jesse and Mike that entire season. Mike was the one recommending no half measures and to essentially take Jesse to pasture because of his issues. \n\nOnce Walt saw the news about the kid being killed, he rushed to save Jesse from himself. Walt put himself at great personal risk for Jesse. Killing game was simply self preservation.\n\nSeason 4 was Walt t starting to go o a bit crazy, but I believe he was right. Gus would\u2019ve eventually offed him. Gus & Mike were trying to manipulate Jesse against Walt, and replace Walt with Jesse once they realized he could cook.\n\nHonesty, mikes entire rant seemed like self righteous garbage. Walt WAS an egomaniac by then, but I think he would\u2019ve happily worked for Gus had Jesse not gone rogue. The fact that Mike acts like walter killed Gus for funsies isnt accurate. Gus was planning to move against Hank, and Walt escalated  to protect hank & his family.

And the opening scene is his iconic death scene. I imagine there\u2019s plenty of archived footage of that scene shot at different angles. So, we start off with a shot of just outside the hospital room. We hear the bell ringing, and the room explodes. Then of course, Gus walks out, straightens his tie, and we pan over to his demolished face, he falls over.

If BCS has more info, then I do not mind getting my mind changed.\n\nEveryone loves Mike. And he said that Walt ruined a good thing. How?\n\n1. Gus refuses to work with Walt because of Jesse. He goes so far as wanting to kill Jesse and people seem to forget that Mike has absolutely no fucking problem doing it. He even tells Walt on a couple of occasions that Jesse needs to go. \n\n2. After selling the 40 pounds of Walt's meth, Gus finally understands what Gale meant by the difference between his and Walt's product. He then tries repeatedly to hire Walt, who wants out. He then plays to Walt's ego and pits him and Jesse against each other to make sure thay Walt agrees. Something he succeeds.\n\n3. After getting beaten up by Hank, Jesse threatens Walt, saying he will cook by himself and if it ever happens that he gets caught, he will give the cops Walt on a silver platter. So Walt needs to get Jesse to work with him. Something he manages to do. If Gus finds out, Jesse is dead. \n\n4. They start cooking. Everything is going well. Then Jesse finds out about Combo. Now here's the thing: Gus 100% knew that his crew was using kids. They had his blessing for it. I am sure of that. Gus is too much of a control freak and perfectionist and professional businessman not to know. He is not over using kids. He is also not over killing kids as he threatens Holly. So Gus knew they were using kids, he knew they used the kid to kill Combo, and I am sure he ordered the death of Tomas. So that means that the whole meeting with Jesse and the two henchmen was just a facade. He had no interest in keeping the peace. He just wanted to protect his own interests. \n\n5. Walt protects Jesse and kills the two henchmen. Jesse runs. Immediately after, Gus is pissed and wants to kill Jesse. He lies to Walt when he says its fine and he can cook with Gale, but in reality, he wants Gale to take over immediately and he wants to kill Walt. Walt manages to understand and anticipate that. And just in time. Walt has done nothing wrong other than defend himself and his partner. So Jesse kills Gale. \n\nFrom this point onwards, Gus will try to kill Walt and replace him at the earliest. Walt knows this, and Jesse know this. So Walt needs to kill Gus before he dies. \n\nThere was more to write but I'm on mobile so I will do that later. \n\nBut where did Walt ruin a good thing?

Now I'm rewatching it after 10 years and I view his character very differently.\n\nI remember I used to feel a lot more sympathy towards him, and I too would get annoyed at characters like Skyler, but this time it's the other way round. Skyker is just a good wife and mother who is worried and trying to look out for her family, while Walter disappears for hours on end without, even missing his daughter's birth. I feel awful for Jesse who is just a guy who took the wrong path in life but is a good and loving person, and you just wish he could escape that life. I feel bad for Hank who is like that tough uncle who deep down has a soft good caring heart. I feel bad for Walter Jr who doesn't show it that much but worries greatly about his dad and the cancer. And so on.\n\nAnd meanwhile Walter just keeps growing more rotten, evil and greedy. Of course, the show is called \"Breaking Bad\" for a reason, and his character development is incredible. Skyler's character is also standing in the \"hero's\" way so it's normal to dislike her. All characters are magnificently crafted to meet their purpose in the show.\n\nMaybe being a teenager Walter seemed so much cooler, but it's funny now that I'm a bit older that he's probably the guy I like the least - despite loving his character somehow.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677324552.0},{"title":"I made Walter in Blender!","author":"sunken_onion","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/0z4wimczx9ka1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677304582.0},{"title":"Why was Walt's meth purity the same while cooking in the RV and in Gus's lab?","author":"HentaiAccount_6","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingbad\/comments\/11bim0z\/why_was_walts_meth_purity_the_same_while_cooking\/","text":"In the early episodes, they show us that Walt's meth's purity in 99.1 while he was cooking in the RV and it's still the same in \"Say My Name\".

Sure, he undoubtedly loved his family, but that always came second. Walt just liked cooking. It made him feel alive and gave him a sense of control, which he desperately needed. The only thing shocking about the \u201cI did it for me\u201d scene at the end was that Walt was actually able to admit it.\n\nAnd second, I always found the family justification to be completely hollow. It was always more about Walt\u2019s pride than the actual well being of his family. I felt the show was very clear about giving Walt numerous solutions that would\u2019ve never required him to break a single law, and he rejects all of them out of pride. There are multiple points where the \u201cI\u2019m doing this for my family\u201d is shown to be completely bullshit too. When trying to convince him to take the 5 million, Jesse calls him out on the \u201c737,000\u201d figure Walt came up with in the beginning. And the conversation between Walt and Saul about using the website to launder the money is hilariously illustrative of how egotistical Walt is, that he can\u2019t even fathom not being able to take credit for the money. He was more concerned with the idea of being a provider for his family than actually doing what\u2019s in their best interest.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think it\u2019s alright to root for Walt, I did too at many points. But it seems like way too many people just bend over backwards to justify Walt\u2019s actions, when they aren\u2019t really excusable.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677257875.0},{"title":"El Calmino","author":"General-Advance-2515","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingbad\/comments\/11bj19v\/el_calmino\/","text":"I apologize if this was spoken about already but as anyone watched it and liked how it wrapped up Pinkman's story?\n\nI tried to watch it buy woukd get sleepy or super busyi caught a lot of the storylinebut i need to admit..\n\nMy Dad influenced my view on Jesse.

How did the two street-level dealers that Jesse wanted to kill (the ones who recruited Andrea's brother, Tom\u00e1s) manage to get an audience with Gus Fring? Why were they even allowed to know who he was for that matter?\n\n2. Why exactly did Gus suddenly turn on Victor in the lab after years of his loyal service?\n\nThe usual explanations given for the latter event are as follows:\n\n- Victor was seen at Gale's apartment and became a loose end that needed to be tied up.\n- Victor was messing up the cook and putting the product at risk because of his hubris.\n- Gus was furious about Gale's death but knew he still needed Walt, and Victor was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nHere is another possibility that I like to imagine is true: The two dead dealers at the center of the conflict between Gus and Walt\/Jesse were close childhood friends of Victor. That explains why Gus was willing to mediate between them and Jesse and why Victor had to die when killing Walt was no longer an option.\n\nVictor was probably furious with Walt over their deaths and was just waiting for the day that he would become expendable. He may have even asked to be the one to kill him when the time came. When Gus found out that Walt was his only remaining chemist, he realized that Victor wouldn't be satisfied with letting Walt live indefinitely. If Gus didn't act fast, he might just lose both his chemists in the same night.\n\nObviously, there was no reason for Walt to know why Gus killed Victor, but if Mike and Tyrus knew why Victor had to go, it might explain their continued loyalty.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1677220865.0},{"title":"Favourite scene in the show?","author":"Exciting_Ad_7917","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/breakingbad\/comments\/119zvyz\/favourite_scene_in_the_show\/","text":"Mine has to be when Gus poisons Eladio and his men, he finally got his sweet revenge after all his patience building up to that moment.

Me for the second time, my stepdad for the first time (he loved it btw)\n\n\nOne thing concerns me though. By the end, my dad thought that Gus was right about Jesse, in that you can never trust a junkie. Now, I get it, some drug addicts are untrustworthy, but imo Jesse is one of the few characters in the show who is actually LOYAL and has a good heart. \n\n\nHe\u2019s not perfect, no. And he\u2019s certainly not a good guy, but he went the extra mile for Walt and only turned on him after he learned how evil Walt had become. But because he became an informant, my dad said he was worthless. And I\u2019m here thinking wow. \n\n\nOne of the themes with Jesse (and Walt, I guess) is that you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover.

Then immediately realizes it\u2019s not a great idea because Walt is bringing in too much money for the car wash. She then is a total dick to Walt and wants to send their kids away because the lifestyle is too dangerous. What the hell did she think it was gonna be like? He is cooking meth for a huge distributor. Then when Walt eliminates the threat to the family it makes no difference to her. It was all okay when she wanted him to do it for hanks treatment but she can\u2019t forgive Walt for trying to leave something for his family when he was supposed to die? Idk just really annoys me that she did everything she could to work her way into it only to make it all seem like it was Walts fault and he\u2019s the only one to blame. He didn\u2019t cook Teds books for them (again which is totally justified in her mind). \n\nI just needed to vent about this because she is just such a frustrating character.","upvote_ratio":0.31,"created_utc":1677296188.0},{"title":"BrBa Tattoo","author":"Ravioli_nomnom","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/8inevcwbazja1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677157500.0},{"title":"What does this picture mean?
