        "text": "Hello everyone. I am a first-year PhD student, and currently in my second lab rotation. In May, I will have to make a decision and stick with a lab to complete my dissertation. I don’t know which lab to choose. Ultimately, both labs have been overall good experiences, both want me to continue with them, and both have sufficient funding. \n\nMy first rotation focused on Parkinson’s Disease, the whole reason why I pursued a PhD in the first place. However, this lab is known to be the most toxic lab in our department. Everytime I told someone I was in their lab, I would receive negative responses and horror stories (they fired a grad student for falling asleep due to being overworked). Even other PI’s openly expressed dislike for this lab. I personally did not have a super bad experience (slightly off-putting things), and Parkinson’s research is my career passion.\n\nI’m currently in a lab where the PI and lab are brand new. I am his first grad student ever, and we have a great working relationship. His research focuses on inflammation, which is similar to what I did in the research industry prior to PhD program. The types of assays performed in his lab will help me return to the contract research industry, especially since I want to stay in my small town where there is only one company. The only problem? I lack passion for this topic. The research is extremely cool, but I don’t find the same excitement. \n\nTLDR; this is an extremely tough decision that I’m losing sleep over. Do I continue my PhD with a lab known to be toxic by everyone, but the research topic is my passion and the reason I pursued a PhD in the first place? Or do I choose the new PI with the brand new lab, we have a close working relationship, the techniques will help me more in the industry, but I just lack passion for the research? Thank you all for reading, and any advice is welcomed.",

This encourages researchers to a) actually participate in the reviewing process and b) incentivises to actually care about delivering high quality reviews. A) because it increases publication output, would be helpful for grants, gives credit where credit is due and overall also makes reviewing attractive for career reasons. And b), because your name will be on the final paper and publishing bad science will impact your reputation as well. \n\nBut what do you think?",

It gave me a list and I tried further narrowing the results with the following question.\n\n\\&gt;Me:  Which of the mentioned papers addresses the implications in regards to global stability and security? \n\n\\&gt;AI:  John Mearsheimer's paper \"The Future of Multipolarity\" addresses the implications of a multipolar world in regards to global stability and security. In this paper, Mearsheimer argues that a multipolar world would be more stable than a unipolar world dominated by a single superpower, but less stable than a bipolar world with two dominant powers. Mearsheimer explains that in a multipolar world, multiple great powers are likely to compete with each other, which could lead to conflict. However, he also notes that the presence of multiple great powers can help to balance power and prevent any one power from becoming too dominant. As a result, Mearsheimer concludes that a multipolar world would be more stable than a unipolar world, but less stable than a bipolar world. \n\nNow, I have searched everywhere on the internet and I have not found the mentioned paper. Could it be that it changed under a different name or the paper might just not exist? Could this dollar-tree AI be tripping?\n\nThank you!",

It was submitted to ArXiv by one of the PIs (say Prof. A). In the ArXiv preprint, I was listed as the first author. Although I helped draft the preprint, I do not remember adding the author names, and I also remember my PI sending me an updated version where he had changed formatting and added our names and affiliation. \n\nOver a week after the ArXiv submission, Prof. A has submitted our paper to a journal (as we had discussed), but in the emails we receive from the journal, and in the journal submission portal, he is listed as the first author, and the ordering has changed. He is the corresponding author, so I am not sure if this is why the ordering is different, or if he has entered it differently. \n\nI knew both PIs before I began this project, and they are quite nice. So I don't think this is an intentional action, especially since he had listed me as the first author in the preprint. Still, I would like to clarify this discrepancy. I am in the process of applying to Ph.D. positions and the first authorship would help my applications, because the paper has also been submitted to a well-reputed journal in my field. How do I bring this up with my PI?",

        "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI am a European student enrolled in a PhD program in Canada. I am about to graduate, and the four and a half years I've spent working on my research program were the most traumatizing and challenging years of my life. The challenges were caused mainly by a precarious financial situation and burnout, as well as by a total lack of support, intellectual stimulation, and scientific guidance from my research director and the PI. I feel exploited and want others not to fall into the trap that somebody should have warned me about. I think all this could have been easily avoided, had there been a universal platform where graduate students could freely exchange practical information about their program and share their experiences. I prepared a little immersive scenario, if you want to get to the details of the idea, scroll down to the conclusion section.\n\n**Before the enrollment:**\n\nYou've just got accepted for a project of your dreams. You already see yourself adorned with a graduate cap and robe, holding proudly your well-deserved diploma. Finally, it is your chance to prove yourself, dive deeply into your own innovative scientific project; meet like-minded researchers and gain access to the international scientific community. You're done with the university inscription and the immigration procedures - all ready to go. What can go wrong?\n\nEverything. Graduate students, especially foreigners, are utterly vulnerable and dependent on their research director/PI before, during, and after the program. It's hard to comprehend to what extent before one finds themselves in the position of a graduate student. Before enrolling in the program and joining the research team, we rarely have access to the testimonies of former graduates. If we luckily get in touch with them, they are often the ones chosen by the director/PI. Our whole future career is in the hands of the director/PI, and being all enthusiastic and full of optimism PhD candidates - we usually won't risk our freshly-gained acceptance for the thesis by pushing too much in the search for a second opinion.\n\n**During the enrollment**:\n\nLet’s say it is going not-so-well. You find yourself far away from home, with no support network, and in financial dire straits. You are left alone with the project with nobody to guide you. The only interaction you have with your director/PI consists of submitting monthly reports, and you feel that you're nothing but cheap labor in their eyes. You start to accumulate grudges and contempt for your supervisors, but you won't dare to search for help at the university. Besides, what can they do? Everybody knows that a thesis is a struggle, it's normal. The time passes, the project does not advance very well, and you struggle with motivation. Even without paying the tuition fees, you’re way below the poverty line - you must work part-time along with your thesis. You’re exhausted, but you persist anyway. You’ve spent too much time working on the project, it’s too late to give it up. You see your friends travel, buy their first house, start a family, and have well-paid jobs.\n\nYour whole life during graduate studies depends on your research director/PI. It's them who oversee your funding, it's them who will provide you with the documents necessary to prolong your student visa (if you require one). It's they who can make the thesis either an opportunity for growth or a living hell. Research directors/PI can exert their power over graduate students with total impunity. No university (especially a paid North American university) will intervene if the graduate experience is not satisfying for the students, yet the research team still generates diplomaed doctors. No university will risk its reputation or the participation of a renowned researcher in a graduate program for the sake of a student's well-being. Quitting is always an option, but one would have to explain the hell of a long gap in the CV, as well as justify to oneself the long months of exploitation endured. Many of us hope to graduate soon, oblivious or kidding ourselves about the unpredictability of a scientific project, which can take long years to develop. For many of us, a thesis in a foreign country is a chance to enter the world of international research, would be a pity to mess that up, right?\n\n**After graduation**: You finally got your diploma. You managed. Was it worth the struggle? Did it prepare you to enter the job market and find a post that will compensate you according to your expertise and all the years spent studying? Looks like the best you can opt for is a post-doc. It seems like after at least ten years of studies you still need an ''internship'' to refine your competencies. You'd gladly move on and forget about those years spent working on the thesis, but wait\n\n...you need your research director's reference letter to get a job.\n\n**Conclusion**: Why is it just us, the students, who need the reference letters? What if the research directors needed to prove that they are apt to guide the students along the thesis before they enroll a new student? Or at least, we, the students, should have the possibility to take conscious decisions on what we are putting ourselves in before we start a long-term engagement in a research team.\n\n**The information gap must disappear.**\n\n**The exploitation of graduate students must stop.**\n\nWe need an international platform where each research graduate’s experience would be rated, and the information would be freely available to the student community. Graduate students suffer all around the world. This platform will be certainly filled with complaints and warning signs, but we must not forget to acknowledge and share our experiences with amazing mentors who inspired us to pursue a career in research in the first place.\n\nScience-hub changed the dynamics of access to knowledge. We need to do the same with graduate studies - to take away the power from the ones who monopolize it and wield it to our advantage. I propose an idea to create a platform inspired by Glassdor-like websites. We can call it a ‘’PhDeal’’. Specify your university, specify your program, and name your research director. Then, anonymously, share the information about:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General info about the studies:**\n\nStatus in the country: Citizen/ foreign student, etc\n\nThe duration of the thesis ……… years\n\nThe maximal duration of the thesis ……… years\n\nThe yearly salary/scholarship ………\n\nThe yearly/ total cost of tuition fees………\n\nThe average cost of living in the given place (or the poverty line)………\n\nThe number of papers published………\n\nThe number of papers required to graduate………\n\nThe number of conferences attended………\n\nThe number of off days per year……… days\n\nThe frequency of meetings with the director/PI……… / …………..\n\nThe need to work on a side to live with dignity: YES/NO\n\nAnd rate, in one-to-five stars, subsequent aspects of the PhD life:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General wellbeing**\n\nMental health during the thesis ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nAccess to mental health services at the university ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nAccess to healthcare services ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nFinancial well-being ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nWorkload ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nAccess to additional scholarships ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nStudent life (events, community, etc) ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nAccess to a medical leave/invalidity leave: YES/NO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Supervision/guidance**\n\nScientific expertise/knowledge in the field ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nQuality of mentoring  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nIntellectual stimulation ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nScientific exchange and discussion ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nProactivity ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nAccessibility ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nCommunication ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nFeedback ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nTimely corrections of works ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nConflict resolution ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nA humane approach to the student ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nFeeling of support ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nFlexibility ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nSense of community in the team ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nAcknowledgment of student’s achievements ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAre you happy with the experience? ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nWould you recommend this team/director/PI? ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nWould you recommend this city/university? ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nWork opportunities after graduation ★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne might provide contact information for those interested in exchange.

My mentors weren’t big names in the field, but they believed in me and gave me incredible opportunities. I’m scared that going to a top, prestigious institution for my PhD will bring out a lot of insecurities. While interviewing in person  I was SO impressed by the students and other interviewees. Most of them went to big name undergrads and have worked with famous professors. Honestly, I felt quite mediocre in comparison. (NOTE: they were all incredibly kind. It was just my first time being surrounded by super high achieving people.)\n\nI also have some offers at schools where the students aren’t nearly as intimidating to me (still high achieving but come from more normal backgrounds), and the programs are still great. The schools are well-known with great faculty, but not ultra prestigious.\n\nI feel like if I pass up going to my dream program I’ll always regret not going for it. But I’m also scared of feeling like I don’t belong at a top school.\n\nWhat should I do? I’d appreciate any thoughts and advice.",

He was interviewed on the first week of Dec and was told to get the decision before Christmas or early January. By January, no news and my friend contacted the uni to ask about the outcome and they told him they were still processing his application. Yesterday (Feb 2023) he received an email saying again his application is still processing. Then he called the uni and the person on the admission team emailed him saying that his \"supervisory team\" is incomplete. They are trying to allocate a 3rd supervisor for him. In this case, what can happen to his application? Will they reject him if they can't find a 3rd supervisor for him? It is so odd because the person in the admission team told him his potential supervisor only email them about his interview on 25th Jan, which is more than 1 month after he did his interview. Is the uni really \"looking\" for 3rd supervisor or they are just trying to buy time before rejecting him? All this seems so odd to me. I am also studying PhD but at a top uni and I didn't experience this during my application process. Can anybody give some advice/ views on this matter? We highly appreciate it. Thank you.",

She even refuses to miss a single seminar. \n\nShe has been good to us, her lab members, but it’s getting challenging to work her. She is busy with other work and has trouble recalling what we’re doing and relaying what she needs from us. She wants to continue managing and controlling the research but the only time she thinks about our research is when we’re in a meeting with her. This has been the standard dynamic for awhile now but recently, she has been visibly exhausted (she was good at hiding before), complaining about her 14 hour days, and losing her composure in front of us when we are not giving her what she wants (in terms of the research). \n\nBecause of this, the lab has been generally mismanaged which further adds to her stress. She refuses to relinquish control, even with having a research assistant professor-type of person working for her within the lab. That’s all an issue in and of itself but in our last meeting, I was deeply concerned about how she was behaving. She looked like she was in pain from how exhausted she was. \n\nI’m just a student but I’m concerned for her both personally and professionally.

So far I have an intro which states his thesis and explains that he has two new sources to present as evidence. I then have two paragraphs for each of his sources, and a summary of how he interprets them. My question is, should I do analysis of each source in those sections, or simply explain each of them objectively, and then have a separate analysis section below?\n\nI ask because last semester I had feedback on a paper which said my analysis section was good but the entire paper should have been doing analysis along the way. I come from a science background (I did a BS in Chemistry then a BA in History 8 years later) where we normally lay out the problem, theory, experiments, findings, and analysis separately. I am not sure how to approach this in the humanities though. \n\nIf it matters, I go to one of the Russell Group schools in the UK and the professor who said I needed analysis throughout was an Oxford man thru and thru, so I kind of trusted his advice.

My gut is telling me to just present orally and keep working on my research until the last second.\n\nThis is my first conference/paper so I really just don’t know.

I have recently gotten a professor from an Ivy League US university to be my second reader, and one of the reasons I asked him for co-supervision is the breadth and scope of his knowledge regarding theory - things like anthropological theories, linguistic theories, theories from religious studies. Now that I've had several meetings with him it has become increasingly clear that he expects me to have a basic grasp of most of these things, and I have not. Mind you, I did my MA with distinction, and have always enjoyed reading about things like semiotics, cognitive linguistics, semantics, things like that. But the only time I was ever acquainted with theoretical foundations in class was for an archaeology course, and when a guy from the US taught a semester. \nAdditionally, I've been more in touch with other researchers, and a lot of the time I am just stunned at the things they know I never even heard about. Today at a conference it happened again. \n\nSo I was wondering - is this just a thing that I experience because our institute is a pretty self-contained unit in the German tradition of philology, or is this something that others have noticed as well? \n\nI would also appreciate any literature recommendations that would broaden my horizon, particularly in regards to anthropological theory as applicable for someone who works primarily with texts. \n\n(I hope that I don't sound like an idiot...)",

        "text": "I’m hoping to use this platform to get some advice on a difficult research collaboration situation. I started a research project at an institution, and then moved to a new institution after completing my training. As the lead of the project, I suggested adding a few additional authors that I know well and knew about the project. However, the senior, supervising author suggested adding his own mentee and another other trainee he knows well as co-authors, and I agreed.\n\nSince the addition, in every meeting, the two new co-authors have been behaving in a clique manner. One person would say something, and the other person would immediately and strongly agree. I welcome constructive suggestions, but often times these suggestions are things like \"I do not think this is publishable,\" or \"you said X before so why are you saying Y now,\" and are said in a negative, targeted manner (e.g., with eye rolling). They would also disagree with every suggestion I give. My explanations on the decisions that were made prior to them joining the project did not satisfy them. The senior author has done nothing to mitigate this situation. I attempted to reach out to another co-author to discuss the difficulty I've been receiving, but the senior author found out and told me that I should not meet anyone individually, and that all discussions need to be had as a group. But he would discuss the project with his mentee when they have their meetings.\n\nThen during a recent meeting, one of the new authors said they no longer wanting to help out with this project. However, she will be leading a paper that is based off of my project, and told the group that she believes her lead-authored paper would be more interesting and publishable. She then turned off her camera for the remainder of the meeting, and only wanted to talk about her paper and not the one we were originally working on. Because we are one author short and we need multiple people to help with the data processing, I suggested adding another author. The senior author was resistant to this idea, citing that it would take time for the IRB to be updated.\n\nAlthough I value the project and would want to continue working on this, I find the behavior by the new co-authors really affecting my overall mood and wellbeing. I've been crying after the recent meetings because I've been receiving so much negativity. I spoke to family and friends, and some of them have pointed out that I could potentially be experiencing gaslighting. For instance, the senior author repeatedly says it is my project and I have the say, but every time I suggest something, it is met with resistance, and with feedback on my shortcomings (e.g., I didn't think it through enough). So I no longer trust the senior author to be objective, and do not feel comfortable seeking support from him.\n\nI'm currently deciding on if I should stay on the project with the same co-authors, completely scratch the project, try to bring additional co-authors that I know will be more supportive and objective, or try to bring the project to my current institution.\n\nTLDR: I am leading a project that I started at my old institution and I am at a new institution after completing my training. The senior author added new co-authors that are his mentees. I have been experiencing potentially gaslighting/bullying behavior from these new co-authors that is affecting my wellbeing. Should I stay on the project, scratch the project, add co-authors that I think are more supportive, or try to do the project at my current institution?",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I am applying to various MS in AI programs and my research supervisor has asked for a draft LOR to make his work easier. Can you please review this draft LOR, and critique it in anyway you want? This will be extremely valuable for me 🙏🏽\n\n\n\nThe draft LOR:\n\nDear Admissions Committee,\nI am writing this letter of recommendation for Chirantan Ganguly, a student of BTech. in ECE at University of Calcutta (Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics), for the [University Name]'s Masters program in Artificial Intelligence. As his research supervisor for over a year, I have had the pleasure of working closely with Chirantan and I can confidently say that he is an exceptional student with exceptional potential.\n\nChirantan joined Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Pune as a research intern under my supervision during his second year of studies. Despite having limited knowledge in Machine Learning algorithms, he demonstrated remarkable persistence and dedication to learning. He read a vast amount of quality research articles, conducted a thorough survey of the latest research articles exploring the use of ML in tackling COVID-19 and its effect on mental and physical health, and was even able to publish review chapters in peer-reviewed and Scopus-indexed books in just four months.\n\nIn addition, Chirantan also worked on a major project with my team in CDAC Pune and Chennai, utilizing ML techniques for the localization of mobile nodes in indoor settings. This project was taken up by CDAC as part of an annual hackathon organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) called ML in 5G Challenge. Chirantan's ingenuity in solving the problem and exceptional presentation skills earned him recognition and helped our team attain the 2nd global rank. Our team was awarded a cash prize and a certificate of commendation by the problem setters (TTC Japan). He even went on to document the steps we took, resulting in a journal publication.\n\nAfter his engagement with CDAC, Chirantan went on to work as an intern at the Scientific Analysis Group of DRDO. He was also selected for the Summer Research Fellowship Program (SRFP), awarded by INSA, NASI, and IASc, to conduct research at IIT Delhi for two months. Throughout all these engagements, Chirantan has consistently maintained his top ranking in his class and exceptional grades. He also has exhibited exceptional leadership skills being his class representative and the head of his University’s coding club.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend Chirantan highly enough for the [University Name]'s Masters program in Artificial Intelligence. His dedication, hard work, eagerness to learn, and level headed problem solving skills combined with his exceptional performance and potential, make him an ideal candidate for the program. I am confident that his participation in this esteemed program and global exposure will help him grow into a renowned AI researcher, a career he has always aspired to pursue.\n\nThank you for considering Chirantan for this opportunity.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",

I have since gotten almost enough yeses for external review and I’m sure it will be fine. But these hiccups or not even hiccups keep creating intense stress.\n\nAnother example: I had to photocopy and scan a bunch of book chapters i authored for the tenure packet . I haven’t photocopied anything in years and it was enormously stressful!! Like thinking that if I photocopied a page and it was slightly blurry the college promotion and tenure committee would reject .\n\nMore info about me: I teach in a social sciences dept at a M1 school with 3-3 load..so not R1. I’ll be going up for tenure with 11 articles (first author or single author in almost all), an edited journal special issue, a co-edited book, and eight peer reviewed book chapters. My teaching evaluations have always been excellent and my annual reviews/this year review have been basically flawless.\n\nSo my question is: how have people who have already gotten tenure handle the constant intrusive thoughts of dread and crippling anxiety that accompany the last year of the process?",

They don’t offer double majors or major/minors. I asked my advisor if I could take an assortment of classes from both major’s tracks with the goal of getting associate in both. They said that wasn’t allowed, they didn’t say why. They did suggest switching to Liberal Arts. Would a Liberal Arts Associate allow me to transfer to a 4 year school and pursue the double major I want?",

We emailed back and forth a couple times but eventually he said that he's not sure I would be a good fit due the the time commitment required. I replied that I could shift around my responsibilities to make more time and I sent a follow up email to this after a week had passed. \n\nIf he does not reply, would it be inappropriate/unprofessional to send another follow-up email? His research is something that I am pretty passionate about and its in a field I've been interested in being involved with for a long time.",

I was selected as a semi-finalist and had a Zoom interview a week ago (all interviews took place across two consecutive days). They said at the end that they will choose three finalists to be invited to campus sometime between now and Mid-March. I know that this might vary between institutions, I am curious about people's experiences though. I wonder if one is already out of the game after one week past the first round of interviews. Any hints would be appreciated!",

Now i dont know which one to pick. I want to pick a safe school (choice between escp and bocconi), and then i would like to find out the best school out of all in case i get accepted! \n\nMy goals: start career in Investment banking at Goldman sachs or Jpmorgan. I have a parttime internship experience next to school in IB in amsterdam in a very small firm.\n\nWhat criteria would you use to pick your school? I look at the ranking and average salary after 3 years (escp: 155.000, lbs: 120.000, Bocconi: 115.000). Im not in it for the money but to me a higher salary reflects faster promotions and more jobs in bulge bracket.\n\nDo you think these salary numbers are accurate? And what school would you guys pick? Thanks in advance!",
