Even the 2018 tax cut won't be enough. They are going to resort to increasingly coercive methods to cheapen labor in the capitalist core, and that will be done through undoing 20th century precedents. Whether through controlling women's reproduction by repealing abortion laws, demolishing the official position of unions, or ruling that wages are free speech, it will be done.\n\nThe Democrats are a bourgeois party. They will never meaningfully jeopardize the profitability of capital. It doesn't matter how many \"democratic socialists\" make up their ranks. If that number becomes dangerously high, Republicans and centrist Democrats will conspire together to halt the tide, as has been done throughout American history.\n\nIn the unlikely event that a Democratic congress passes Medicare for All, the important parts will be ruled unconstitutional. They will never pack the court, because to do so in the defense of social democratic policy will not be tolerated by capital.\n\nSocial Democracy will never happen in America. \"Democratic Socialists\" will not deliver it.\n\nRemember folks, that only two things are certain: We live in Hellworld, and Capitalism creates the conditions for its own overcoming. Social Democracy was a transient phase of capitalist development and that period is behind us. Buckle up. \n\n\n\n",
