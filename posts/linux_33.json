But occasionally something weird will come up that the OS administrator (me) needs to search for possible fixes. \n\nThe problem was with applications installed as SNAP packages. They have been an issue since at least 2017 where these programs can't see some common system elements like attached printers. \n\nI have searched for a fix off and on for years, often just uninstalling a snap app and reinstalling it in a standard \"all-access way\". This method is no longer an option for certain apps. There were suggestions to use a lot of back door terminal commands I could have tried, but I kept looking for something more elegant. After all, it is 2023!\n\nWell, I found it in a post by Tommy Trussell on AskUbuntu.\n\n[ I was able to successfully activate printing using this procedure:\n\n    Open the Ubuntu Software Center application.\n    Search for Firefox and choose it (note it says \"Installed\" next to it).\n    Click the Permissions button.\n    Confirm that its printing permission is set to \":cups-control\".\n\nOn my system, printing had been set to \"(disconnected).\" After I changed it to \":cups-control\" my printers were visible in the Print dialog in Firefox. ]",

I was fed up with the performance and memory overhead of using virtual machines, and I had no other options for running distros on an Unraid host. The idea was to create a tiny container that would remount `/` within its assigned cgroup to a Docker volume or bind mount to a directory somewhere on the host, keeping a fully non-volatile filesystem that could be treated like a lightweight virtual machine. \n\nAt the time, I managed to make it work with a privileged container as a headless server that could be SSHed into. More recently, I've actually been able to turn it into a full headless server *with* a GPU-accelerated desktop environment (using X and an Nvidia card). Would anybody else here be interested in learning how to do it, or have some tips and feedback to help improve the experience (or figure out how to do it without a privileged container)?\n\nSome notable things that were actually possible with this absurd setup:\n\n- Got Arch running, bootstrapped from their Docker image.\n- Used sunshine (Nvidia GameStream server) instead of VNC.\n- KDE Plasma desktop environment.\n- Steam, with working Remote Play and Proton (including 3D games).",

The tl;dr is that a botnet attempts to gain access via ssh, primarily targeting users named \"steam,\" \"steamcmd,\" \"steamserver,\" \"valheim,\" and potentially a few other games. Checking ssh logs on my server, I see intrusion attempts going back to 2022-12-16, and continuing to this day. When I checked my logs, we saw intrusion attempts going back to 2022-12-10, and successful logins going back to 2022-12-11 (yeah... it took them one day to get in.) once they get in, the botnet drops a malware payload in \n\n    ~/.configrc4\n\nprimarily consisting of a bitcoin miner. We noticed this because we saw the process \n\n    kswapd0\n\nmaxing out 12 cpu cores, even when swap was inactive. Some investigation revealed that this instance of kswapd0 was not actually a kernel process owned by root as you'd normally expect, but it was instead a binary in a hidden directory being run as the steam user. \n\n    lsof\n\nrevealed that the steam user was also actively running fake binaries named \n\n    tor\n\nand \n\n    rsync\n\nalso contained within \n\n    ~/.configrc4\n\nI'm currently waiting for tthe server to make a transfer of those files so that I can take a closer look at them (or at the very least, see what virustotal makes of them), but in the meantime i've done a simple DDG search and got a grand total of five results. Four of which were random chinese websites, and the last one was this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/zltnqb/dedicated\\_server\\_hacked\\_for\\_bitcoin\\_mining/](https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/zltnqb/dedicated_server_hacked_for_bitcoin_mining/)  Some tips to protect yourself: 1. Disable password auth in sshd, use ed25519 keys instead 2. For any non-human accounts, set their shell to nologin 3. Install and configure Fail2Ban 4. Make frequent backups, cleaning out malware sucks",

        "text": "I'm considering dual booting my system (Fedora BTW) to run with Windows for game compatability for certain games, and running Fedora when not in certain games. I've heard dozens of horror stories about dual booting: corrupting drives, erasing systems, Windows update wiping the entire Linux OS, even ruining entire SSD's. How accurate is these stories? \n\nI'm not above using Lutris, and am kind of excited to finally run a Linux machine bare metal after a year of toying with VM's on my main rig (laptops run Linux already) but I'm concerned about either my Windows or Linux OS breaking. Anything I should know about dual booting before I partition the drive and create the ISO? My Windows OS is also from my first PC build almost a decade ago, reinstalled every few years because Windows is gonna Windows, but I have years of save files and stuff on them, and like to go back and look at old game saves every few years. Don't really have anything to back my system up to. Not losing that data is very important to me. Would it be too risky to do? Should I just stick my gaming rig with Microsoft, or make the plunge? \n\nThanks to all who could help",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zz0bmh/linux_kernel_mm_struct/",
        "text": "The goal of “mm\\_struct” (aka “Memory Descriptor”) is to used by the Linux kernel in order to represents the process’ address space ([http://books.gigatux.nl/mirror/kerneldevelopment/0672327201/ch14lev1sec1.html](http://books.gigatux.nl/mirror/kerneldevelopment/0672327201/ch14lev1sec1.html)). It is the user-mode part which belongs to the task/process. For more information about memory management I suggest reading [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-memory-management-part-1-introduction-896f376d3713](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-memory-management-part-1-introduction-896f376d3713). \n\nBy the way, until kernel version 2.6.23 the struct was defined under “/include/linux/sched.h” ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.23/source/include/linux/sched.h#L369](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.23/source/include/linux/sched.h#L369)), since “2.6.24” it is  located under “/include/linux/mm\\_types.h” ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.24/source/include/linux/mm\\_types.h#L156](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.24/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L156)).  \n\nAlso, there is a pointer from the process’ “task\\_struct” ([https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-kernel-task-struct-829f51d97275](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-kernel-task-struct-829f51d97275)) that refers to the address space of the process (“mm\\_struct”) which is stored in the “mm” field ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/linux/sched.h#L870](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/linux/sched.h#L870)). You can see us using it in the screenshot below (more on that soon). \n\nOverall, we can say that “mm\\_struct” holds the data Linux needs about the memory address space of the process. Among those data elements are: “mm\\_users” (the number of tasks using this address space), “map\\_count” (the number of virtual memory areas, VMAs, used by the task) and “total\\_vm” (the total number of pages mapped by the task). You can see part of the information stored in “mm\\_struct” by going over “/proc/\\[PID\\]/maps” (checkout “man proc” for more details). \n\nMoreover, If you want to go over all of data elements I suggest going through the definition of “mm\\_struct” as part of the Linux source code - [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/linux/mm\\_types.h#L601](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L601)). Fun fact is that in kernel 6.2-rc1 “task\\_strcut” is referenced in 656 files ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/C/ident/mm\\_struct](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc1/C/ident/mm_struct)).  \n\nLastly, let us go over an example using bpftrace. We can use the following command: **sudo bpftrace -e 'kfunc:schedule { printf(\"%s,%d,%d\\\\n\",curtask-&gt;comm,curtask-&gt;pid,curtask-&gt;mm-&gt;map\\_count); }'.** As shown in the screenshot below, the command prints the name, pid and VMA count for the current task every time the scheduler function is triggered. From the screenshot we can see that kernel threads have a count of zero VMAs (in their case current-&gt;mm==NULL). Also, we can see that the “map\\_count” is one less than the number of rows in “/proc/\\[PID\\]/maps”. It is due to the mechanism of vsyscall (that I will examine in a future writeup). \n\nSee you in my next writeup ;-)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sb4gjzyc19a1.png?width=1407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=340a12b851de339fcc997bf654fb7fadb0c72662",

        "text": "I picked out the laptop to be compatible (Lenovo ThinkBook on a black friday sale for a dang good price). Her now-previous laptop was a Dell that cost about $400 in 2010, I think. It was chugging (3gb RAM, middle-of-the-road Core2Duo processor) and either needed to be upgraded significantly (HDD, processor, memory) or replaced. Pricing out the parts and labor for upgrading and factoring in the wear and tear on the motherboard and other components (chassis has been dropped a few times...)...that computer had a great run and it makes no sense to upgrade it. Literally has duck tape on it. Lubuntu kept it alive for quite some time past its planned obsolescence date (POD?).\n\nShe downloaded the .iso, installed it onto a usb drive, then activated the bios boot menu, booted the live usb, erased that weird mess that still comes pre-installed on far too many computers, installed the OS, rebooted, ran updates, installed their backports PPA.\n\nYes I was on the phone with her for most of it. But I think it was an actual empowering experience for her, demystified a lot of the process.\n\nI'm so glad that at least some hardware manufacturers are making Linux compatibility a priority. Things have come a long way since 2010.\n\nThis week she'll be making a final backup of her old computer, trying to install a few pieces of extra software on her own, and then I'll help her with any extra system configuration and printer installation, restoring the backup to her new computer, etc.\n\nI'm kinda proud of her.",

        "text": "A colleague of mine is doing backups (think 2-3 TB). He tells me he gets\n\n1. 300 MB/s read speed\n2. 50 MB/s compression speed (zstd)\n3. 50 MB/s network transfer speed\n4. 40 MB/s write speed.\n\nAssuming that the compression cannot be made any better and the network not any faster, there is not really that much that can be improved here. There might be room for 20% if the write speed could be increased.\n\nThe output device is a 4TB external USB disk. Not negotiable for this task (this is not a multi-million mission critical activity).\n\nThe filesystem receiving the single backup file is ext4, no disk encryption. \n\nHe writes using `pv` (for infotainment to get an ETA). Intuitively I would have used `pv | dd bs=1M`. But on the other side this goes through the filesystem cache. So if we assume that the USB disk is the bottleneck in the end, the kernel should write out dirty pages at full speed and whatever is inefficient before that should not matter on a somewhat modern CPU with 32 GB of RAM or so.\n\nDo you think my reasoning is correct? Or is there a simple way to write with 50 MB/s to the same disk? Searching around a bit on the net brought up AIO in benchmarks. Would that be relevant for writing a single file on an otherwise idle machine? Can it be done from the command line?",

I figure git push and pull on a few .rem files might be a decent way to keep the mess synchronized via a thumb drive, no matter which machine I'm on when I create the entry, no matter which I'm on when the alert comes up. It would be nice to only issue the alert on a machine if I'm in an active desktop session, so I don't have to clear old alerts.\n\nI have looked at \\`libnotify\\` (and \\`notify-send\\`), which is available on all of the distros I'm using at the moment, but the notifications do not provide very good interruptions. I'm too used to ignoring useless notifications from apps that use that system. A modal dialog that pops up would probably be better.\n\nIs there any reasonably portable way to do this? I can't keep these calendars synced and none of them have any reasonable way I can find of syncing across an air airgap.",
