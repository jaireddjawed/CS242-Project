        "text": "I’m Joss Lyons-White, a PhD researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment.\n\n***My research is on the relationship between palm oil and deforestation and, in particular, the role played by voluntary commitments made by companies to achieving ‘zero deforestation’.***\n\nI’ll be joined on this AMA by my co-researcher Dr Andrew Knight, senior lecturer at Imperial and a Partner Investigator at the Centre of Excellence in Environmental Decisions at The University of Queensland.\n\nIn May 2018 Andrew and I published research on the existing barriers stopping palm oil companies from implementing their zero-deforestation commitments: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378017310117](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378017310117)\n\n**Some background to our research**\n\nLots of palm oil companies – ranging from palm oil producers and traders to consumer goods manufacturers and retailers – have adopted commitments to “zero deforestation”, or “no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation” (NDPE).\n\nThis means companies have promised to eliminate any association between deforestation and their operations. Lots of these commitments (including a collective pledge made by the Consumer Goods Forum, which represents over 400 consumer goods companies) are supposed to be implemented by 2020. However, recent reports by NGOs including Greenpeace and Global Canopy have suggested that companies are failing to implement their commitments and the 2020 deadlines are set to be missed.\n\n**About the study and next steps:**\n\nIn 2016, we conducted a study that asked what barriers exist that stop palm oil companies from implementing their zero-deforestation commitments. We found that complex supply chains; a lack of consensus over what “deforestation” means; inadequate support from governments; and persisting markets for unsustainably-produced palm oil in India and China are all major barriers to commitment implementation.\n\nThrough my (Joss) PhD I am now investigating how zero-deforestation commitments can be implemented more effectively, via a study of the perspectives and attitudes that characterise the debate over ‘zero deforestation’ definitions; a study of power and relationships in palm oil supply chains; and a study of the effectiveness of boycotts as a tool for forcing companies to improve their practices.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n* Joss Lyons-White: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/joss.lyons-white15](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/joss.lyons-white15)\n* Dr Andrew Knight: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/andrew.knight1](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/andrew.knight1)\n\n**Useful links:**\n\n* Our study: [Palm oil supply chain complexity impedes implementation of corporate no-deforestation commitments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378017310117) (published in *Global Environmental Change*); and [press coverage in The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/palm-oil-food-supply-sustainable-deforestation-indonesia-malaysia-orangutans-imperial-a8380711.html)\n* An overview of the role played by palm oil in tropical deforestation:  [Oil palm and biodiversity](https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/47753) (published by the *International Union for the Conservation of Nature*)\n* A summary of the progress of implementation of zero-deforestation commitments in the lead-up to 2020: [Zero-Deforestation Commodity Supply Chains by 2020: Are we on Track? ](https://climatefocus.com/publications/zero-deforestation-commodity-supply-chains-2020-are-we-%20track)(Published by the Carbon Disclosure Project and Climate Focus)\n* Other recent research on zero deforestation:  [Hybrid governance in agricultural commodity chains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618304372) (*Journal of Cleaner Production* ); [The role of supply-chain initiatives in reducing deforestation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-017-0061-1) (*Nature Climate Change*)\n\n***We'll be back at 11:00 EST / 16:00 GMT to answer your questions!***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE \\[11AM ET / 4PM BST\\]: And we’re LIVE!\n\nHere’s proof that we’re here in person to answer your questions: [https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1029372018439979010](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1029372018439979010)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE \\[1PM ET / 6PM BST\\]: Thanks very much for your great questions.

I had a weird idea three years ago to comb through Taylor Swift's albums to check a few theories I had about patterns I thought I could see in her lyrics.\n\nThe first major discovery was that her most used word is \"know\" and my editor on this project, Stephanie, thought that was an interesting angle to use to dive in.\n\nAt a roundtable discussion I hosted with the Times music critic and four others from the community, I asked what they thought they knew about Taylor Swift and used those ideas as  a jump off point to see whether I could prove or disprove the ideas with her lyrics. For example, I thought she was very daydreamy in her earlier albums, but she seemed to shake it off in Reputation. I was wrong. She's still just as daydreamy, just with a splash of adult-themed content.\n\nYou can read the story, watch the videos and check out the charts of the project [called \"Look What Taylor Swift Made Me Do\" here.](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/features/what-taylor-swift-made-me-do/)\n\nI'm getting ready for her concert in Tampa tonight, but excited to answer any questions!\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/tmac0201/status/1029367916091908097](https://twitter.com/tmac0201/status/1029367916091908097)",

I kept my kidneys functioning for almost 30 years through diet, exercise and huge doses of prednisone. For this commenting on my weight. I’m carrying about 3.5 liters of dialysis fluid in my Peritoneal cavity. The solution is basically a sugar water solution. It adds a huge number of calories to my daily intake. I am a vegetarian and I exercise daily. I only strength train 3 days a week now because my recovery times are longer. My BMI is well within the range for surgery.I walk 2 miles daily. I have 2 rescues ( hence the daily walks). I also care for my mother. She has Alzheimer’s And cannot manage her medications. I do not smoke. I don’t really drink. I did try marijuana (withDr approval) for restless leg. I did not like it so I discontinued it. I have been on dialysis for almost 6 years. The wait times keep going up and my health is declining. I have applied at multiple transplant programs. At least I think I have, the process is definitely not transparent. It all has to be done by your Dr.s office and no one will tell you anything. Even the information I have on the wait times is from a third party. The medical community is very close mouthed about all of. I do not know where I am on the list I do not know how long my wait will be. I went to stand on the road because I’m desperate. I do not want to die while waiting on this list. It was the only thing I could think to do.i did not go out there with the intention of gaining notoriety. I’m actually a very quiet very private person. I do not want to be famous I just want to live. Someone sent me a message about doing an AMA. I will try to figure it out tonight. I’d like to thank you all for your support.

I primarily do toxicity tests on objects before they go into space. I am also a volunteer on NASA's odor panel. We test the smells of all items that will be within the habitable areas of the International Space Station and check for disagreeable or offensive smells may nauseate astronauts and possibly put astronaut’s productivity and mission at risk.

These kids have amazing stories, mostly terrifying. I interact with the kids daily; I talk to them, and mostly do a lot of listening. I can't interview them directly for an AMA, but I hope I can convey their sentiments and observations to you all.\n\nObviously, my thoughts and words here are my own, and not reflective of any company policy. I'll also maintain confidentiality of the kids at the shelter.\n\nEdit: Been fun!  I'm heading to bed.  If anyone asks any more questions, I'll get to them in the morning.

I have studied elephant behavior and communication for over 40 years and am Scientific Director of ElephantVoices and a National Geographic Explorer. My research and conservation work has focused on the elephants of Amboseli and Maasai Mara, in Kenya, and of Gorongosa, Mozambique. Read about our ongoing Gorongosa Elephant Project, supported by National Geographic [here](https://www.elephantvoices.org/studies-a-projects/gorongosa-elephant-project.html). If you'd like to learn about the Gorongosa elephants, check out this page [here](https://www.elephantvoices.org/studies-a-projects/the-gorongosa-elephants.html). We are currently working to create a unique online resource on elephant behavior called, The Elephant Ethogram, where we will document over 300 elephant behaviors with written descriptions, images, audio and video. You can read more about the work I do on www.elephantvoices.org. \n \nThe National Geographic article, [What elephant calls mean: A user's guide](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/what-elephant-calls-mean/), is based on our long-term research and our thousands of recordings of elephant calls. \n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/iycdc4k5eye11.jpg\nhttps://twitter.com/NatGeo/status/1028689045969428480",
