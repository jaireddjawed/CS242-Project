I finish college in a couple months, I don’t want to go to university because I’m not a big educational person. I’m currently taking graphics, computer science and maths - all Alevels. \n\nHere’s the question, will I be able to get into a JavaScript developer job without a degree? What will I need to know? I have experience in a JavaScript, react, redux and node. What projects are the most likely to catch an interviewers eye? \n\nMy dad, who works as a Devops consultant, said I could do it especially if I go through startups. Obviously though, as he works in Devops, he doesn’t know what’s the best for front end for me to know and what projects to have. \n\nAny advice appreciated! Xx",

I got then another offer for an internship and since nothing was promised with the conversion, I left this current job after 5 months and started the internship with the hopes of converting there in case i didnt get the other one.\n\nThen got the conversion so I had to resign from the internship after 4 months and start the new job, which turns out was extremely hardcore (who would've thought?!) so I just resigned again (also other personal problems).\n\nSo my background looks like:\n\n\\- internship x 2\n\n\\- 7 m part time -&gt; resigned\n\n\\- internship\n\n\\- full time 5 m -&gt; resigned\n\n\\- internship \\~4 m -&gt; resigned\n\n\\- job \\~ 5m -&gt; resigned (this was huge if i could do it)\n\nNow I am applying to other jobs but I feel extremely scared that this is a huge red flag. Is it? What should I have done better? not that now i can change anything. Of course I could just not add the last job and internship, but what am i going to say when they ask me about the gap? Yes, I was doing my master's, but i ended up leaving it as well once i got the conversion.",

        "text": "I like my job other than being paid peanuts. If I could do this part-time and have a second source of income, that would be ideal. It's easy to take extended time off and the travel benefits are fantastic. Every year that I gain seniority, I get a bit more control over my schedule.\n\nThat said, everyone in this industry seems to have a second job. I'm tired of being broke and I don't like flying full-time. I'm on my 5th year and things are getting better, but even if I stuck around until my pay is topped out (year 12), I'd be earning less than a junior software developer. \n\nOther than getting to travel, the job can be dull. It's about as mindless as work gets. Imagining growing old, doing only this, and not being able to retire until super late in life bums me out. Previously I worked for Apple for several years doing front-line sales (retail and home-based chat).\n\nI'm 34 and never went to school when I was younger. I recently got an A.S. from a community college and took a few computer science courses along the way. I find the field exciting and interesting. I'm transferring credits into WGU and going that route for a C.S. degree. I want to have a plan B, and, after 6 months out of school, I find myself missing it. Even if I don't end up using the degree, I want to challenge myself and see if I can do it. I figure if I'm going to get a degree it might as well be in a challenging, in-demand field.\n\nI'm also considering the idea of a full-on career change, but it would be a huge lifestyle adjustment. The airlines end up with a lot of lifer flight attendants cause once you pay your dues and start making a semi-living wage, you're six years in and afraid you'll regret quitting. I met a lady who flew for 25 years, quit, and missed it so much she came back at 1st year pay, being on-call 24 hours a day (as juniors are at my airline). I worry that I'd end up hating working in tech and regret my decision. Then again, you can afford a lot of plane tickets with these salaries...\n\nI've read some posts on here that freelancing isn't realistic for a beginner and that part-time jobs don't really exist. Is this the consensus? Any advice on non-traditional ways to build a career in tech that would allow me to keep flying?",

It's in an interesting area and promises good growth and lots of pure development work. BUT, all the interviews I've had so far were unfriendly and I did not get a good vibe from anyone I met (all managers). Nothing toxic, but I did not really gel with anyone.\n\nThe second position is maintaining a large piece of software. I would work with one of the company's clients to provide support. I'd be debugging, backporting, patching, and testing, but not really developing new features. BUT the company culture was great. I really got along with the person who would be the senior on my team and the company felt much more inviting and friendly.\n\nI would love to hear any thoughts and perspectives from people who've had similar roles. I'm worried about taking a non-development role early in my career, but I'm also worried about working on a team where I can't make friends or get to know my team.",

Requests I deploy my working changes to development environment for review. \n\n**4:05pm**: After review, PM calls to discuss two new deliverables: table needs sort capabilities on all columns, a list-view variant needs to be developed, and these need  done for tomorrow's demo.\n\n**4:15pm**: PM calls minutes later, asks for a third deliverable: Add a row to each table to shows the total.   \n\n**4:55pm**: Minutes before EOD, PM calls a final time. Wants an update on progress/requests a more minor changes. Reminds me of 11am demo and that deliverables should be included. Asks if I'll be done by EOD, but roll backs the question after looking at the time.  \n\nThis has happened on a few occasions. Everything could've/was discussed via DMs. The unexpected next-morning demo for promised non-existent features is infuriating. In typical PM fashion, I received a chuckle after expressing needing more time. Felt like a child who couldn't be trusted.   \n\nMakes me feel like jumping ship. The role *can* be comfy: full-time remote, pay is great for YOE, and it could be worse! Though, I'm nearly @ 1 year mark, no PTO/holiday pay sucks, and the other PM has devs stay late often. So maybe I'm crazy, this is completely normal, and my lack of experience is showing in this post. IDK!      \n\nIs the normal? What should I do in these situations?

Looking for advice on new skills to learn and potential career paths. \n\nMy degree is pretty heavy on mathematics, with the cs parts being data structures, OOP, functional programming, and algorithms. By the time I graduate most of my experience will be in Java and Matlab, and I don't think any of the cs classes I have left have big projects. I'm feeling a little lackluster in my current cs skills and I'm worried I won't gain much more from my degree, so now is time to do it on my own. \n\nI'm hoping to do some supplemental learning this summer that will complement the skills I'll be learning in my degree. I'm for sure learning python. Any other recommendations? \n\n\n\nI'm also looking for career recommendations in CS that would be good for someone who enjoys math and has a lot of math background. One option I'm considering is the data science field, but that's kind of the only one I know of that regularly needs and uses advanced math. What other positions or fields are out there?",

Leading to potential new opportunities, I don't think AI will ever replace us, at least not in my lifetime. From a business standing, that would be scary having an AI be a development team or a majority of it. Don't even wanna begin to think about the technical debt with having to resolve the bugs and such.\n\n\nMy opinion is tech and the demand for web devs continues to grow.

I don't know if my resume sucks, its parsing through ATS poorly, my pay expectations are out of line, my technical skills arent displayed well, or if this process just takes a LONG time and even longer for trying to transition. Maybe my approach to applying is fine. Maybe my resume is decent enough, my application rate is decent enough, my salary expectations are decent enough (~75k+ in a LCOL area, I make 65k in a LCOL area). If there's a red flag in what I've said so far....TELL me. If there's not, then tell me to keep on keeping on. I just want to make sure I'm not shooting myself in the foot with every application.\n\nA big thing is that I applied to ~20-30 jobs back in August and September with a paid resume that was optimized well for ATS but didn't reflect me. It was like overselling my overselling...it didn't feel like \"me\", but I ended up getting 2 phone interviews.

        "text": "So, I'm in the Seattle area and was offered an analytics engineer role since I previously interned at the place last summer. Basically what we do is that we work in our Snowflake database and clean our data and make data enrichments. Technologies that we primarily use are SQL, dbt, Airflow, and a bit of Python for UDFs. The job is extremely easy when I was an intern, but I wanted to work as a SWE instead. I feel like this position is more similar to a data analyst position. \n\nI got an offer of 104k total comp which was too low for me. I replied to negotiate for around 130k instead but the recruiter basically said they feel like the offer they gave me was fair and to respond with my final decision in 24 hours.\n\nI want to decline, I feel like an analytics engineer position is something that will not make me learn anything and I want to do software instead. The job is really easy and the compensation is a bit too low, given I have a background in CS and Math and plan to graduate this quarter.\n\nAm I shooting myself in the foot by declining given the current market? I haven't been interviewing at other places but I probably will have to since I don't have anything lined up. I'm not a big fan of the work as well. I just want anyone's advice to give me since I have 24 hours left. I can respond with more information as well",

        "text": "I have a good mid-career software engineering job at a good company, but am becoming burnt out and dissatisfied with the drudgery of delivering sprint after sprint. I’ve been there for a while so it might be time to go, but having another similar job does not appeal either because I am just burnt out. A break to raise my family, pursue passions, work on my own projects/pick up flexible contract work and generally refocus/recharge does appeal though.\n\nThere is a move of country in my future and some other complications, so for timing reasons, this would end up being a two or three year break.\n\nWould this be career suicide? I’m not terribly worried about “coming in at the same level”, because I just like writing code, but I would like to re-enter as an engineer after the break. It would be lovely to hear from hiring managers or other engineers who took a break.",
