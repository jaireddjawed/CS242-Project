Then it talks about species looking similar but differing only in mating rituals, diet, and geographic location. I get the gist of the concept they're trying to convey, but how does it not apply to humans as well, with distinct different physical features, mating rituals, diets, and geographic location?

Like, yeah, it makes sense that life couldn't have soley originated there, but where else would the RNA that would make proteins have come from? Without an external energy source like lightning, RNA couldn't have ever formed, right?\n\nI'm sorry if I'm missing something obvious, but I just can't figure it out or find any answers. Any help?",

The problem is, I dont really understand the significance of them, or if they're significant.\n\nSo, human lactoferrin has 3 glycosylation sites, and bovine lactoferrin has 5. What does this mean? That bLF is more stable? Does that mean it \\[bLF\\] would be a better agent of antimicrobial effects? Or does it mean it would be be better to apply it therapeutically (as its more stable)? Or is there really no significance to comment on? \n\nAny help on this topic would be greatly appreciated...it's due in 3 days (eek)",

There were at least 4-5 gnats in my room at any given time a few days ago but I think I've destroyed their nest which was basically just a pool of saliva that refused to dry up. For the past 2-3 days it has only been this one gnat which has been increasingly pestering. When I first singled it out, it looked rounder and blacker, but now it seems to have adopted a more yellowish color, and it's more aggravated. I read online gnats live 1-2 weeks, so if my previous assumption that the gnat couldn't have been born more than 5 days ago then does that mean this gnat has only reached its adolescence and is now looking for mates? If so, it isn't flying in circles which is what I read they do when they're looking for mates, but moreso flying around my face/desk which the gnats from 3+ days ago rarely ever did.",

        "text": "I apologize if this is a dumb question, but something just isn't clicking. We were learning about how climate change is affecting shellfish's ability to create shells because of the increasing acidity of the ocean, but I don't see how less carbonate would be available in the ocean when carbonic acid is created. My thought process is that as CO2 enters the ocean, it undergoes this reaction\n\n     CO2 + H2O -&gt; H2CO3\n\nHow does that affect the carbonate already available in the ocean if it is being created with the CO2 from the atmosphere?",

It seems we are at least somewhat monogamous and the male human is more involved in childcare. Unless the position was good for both hetero and lesbian sex? \n\nAlso the bonobo clitoris is quite different in size etc and anatomy than the human.\n\nI mean...interesting theory, but still a theory nonetheless.",
