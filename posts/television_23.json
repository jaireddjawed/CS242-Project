I was completely baffled when Robin Williams turned out to be the father of Joel McHale! Or is this some sort of new deep fake in use or something?\n\n I literally can't find anything on Google about this. It's sort of strange that no one else has asked, but maybe I'm missing something obvious.",

Yes, there are some dated aspects but considering they are 50-60 years old, they feel fresh. Since finishing I have not found a show that gives me quite that the same feeling. I tried Who’s the Boss and that worked for a bit but lost me around late season 2. Malcolm in the Middle has been fun but still not the right vibe. Besides the person who recommended these shows to me, i haven’t met anyone in the wild who has recently watched them. Anyone else out there?",

Taking them off and moving them nowhere is not only a bad move in terms of streaming, but also imo a shitty business move.\n\nYou can agree or disagree, but come I mean seriously, get your shit together, ABC/FOX/DISNEY.

Murder happens.  Ominous visions - maybe set in the past?  Maybe the future?  Only clue is all the bodies shown strewn about that bridge, in the opening credits.\n\nNot asking for spoilers, just some feedback from anyone who's seen this show.  Is it worth sticking it out?  Or is it another *From*, a series that spins off side plots and never resolves the main storyline?\n\nI mean... there's three seasons!

        "text": "This has been brought up before, but I feel like there should be a change in many award shows like Oscars or Emmys where a lot of villains in a show get snubbed.\n\nI was looking at list of nominations and awards and felt like many times, nominees are selected based on their likability.\n\nFor example, in Good Morning show, I'd argue that Steve Carrels character (a disgraced tv anchor admist a sexual harassment scandal) was well acted and had a lot of range yet he got snubbed. His character was the most intriguing and he portrayed it so well. Yet Roy Kent from Ted Lasso is pretty one sided with his acting. Dont get me wrong, I think the actor, the character and the show is great--- Roy Kent is one of the highlights of the show, but with that said, I don't think the role deserves a best actor nominee. Sure he's well written (then give the show a nomination for best writing) and the acting is fine but range wise, he's on tracked.\n\nId even argue that many people could fill in that role.. it's not particularly a demanding role. \n\nI just hope actors and actresses who really portray a lot of good acting--- especially villains shouldn't be overlooked. Joffery from GoT was unlikable and even managed to get death threats from idiotic viewers who got triggered by his portrayal of the character. I mean, if that doesn't deserve even a nomination...when will these actors and actresses get recognized for their work?",

I have seen a lot of the earlier Star Wars live action stuff but have no interest in most of the projects anymore as large amount of just okay content burned me out on the franchise. I will be watching The Mandalorian season 3 though as I love that show. I have also been love The Last Of Us and Stranger Things, I watched Sweet Tooth as well but it was just okay. I am looking forward to the next season for all of these shows! My favorite animated shows are Avatar The Last Airbender, The Owl House, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, The Legend Of Korra, and The Legend Of Vox Machina. I love fantasy, story driven shows with few to none episodic episodes, found family elements, and science fiction. Romance is fine too if it a well done subplot and not a drawn out thing for drama, that’s a thing I didn’t like about the early episodes of The Legend Of Korra. My favorite romance in any media is from The Owl House. So thank you for any suggestions!",

The media was all over them. The thing is, the focus of peoples' ire seemed to be on Stodden rather than Hutchison. Yes, Hutchison received some criticism for this \"marriage\", but not in the same way his *underaged* wife did.\n\nShe was on TV. A *lot*. In particular shows like *The Soup* and *Couples Therapy*. She was also featured prominently on entertainment-news shows like Entertainment Tonight and E! News.\n\nThey ripped her for her appearance. They ripped her for making \"sexy\" faces at Hutchison while he was talking. They regarded her as an idiot, a bimbo, a slut. She was the butt of everyone's joke for those few years. She was 16!\n\nHutchison had groomed her online for years before actually proposing to her. He acted as her teaching tutor, eventually worming his way in with her family. Her parents allowed all this to happen. Under their roof.\n\nJoel McHale's years on The Soup especially focused on Stodden, replaying clips of her acting awkward, with the audience howling away with laughter. \n\nIt really is disgusting how this poor child was treated during all this, how her \"relationship\" with Hutchison was portrayed as a Lolita-type situation with Stodden as the seductress who captured Hutchison. Makes me wanna puke.\n\nReally nasty. All those entertainment shows making fun of a 16 year old victim of a pedophile. What the fuck.",

The whole theme of a 1920s gala ball that's underwater and there's robots and fancy new technology would be a world I think audiences everywhere would enjoy living vicariously through. (Even non-fans and fans of the original game would like it.) Then, in the last season, it's like infinite where you aren't underwater anymore. There's  enough story there to have multiple seasons. I think it would be really successful if netflix picked it up cause they are used to taking risks and ditching whatever projects aren't successful for them, lol. I've always thought assassins creed was a good ip too, too bad they ruined it with a trash movie. I could see a long running tv show with a high budget and respectable actors make ac a hit show too. I'd like to see more games adopted into TV shows and movies such as the Witcher has been doing well for Netflix, I'm sure there's others that'd do well there too.",

        "text": "TLOU has been a resounding success and there's been a good amount of online narrative on how it's a perfect example of video game screen adaptions \"done right\". I find that view quite misinformed, so throwing it out here for a discussion.\n\nI played TLOU the game, the source material, when it was first released around a decade ago. It was lauded as one of the best told stories in gaming, and its execution, in my view, borrowed heavily from tv and film productions - what i call the Walking Dead formula (not necessarily the series itself). Those who have played the game and are now watching it on HBO would surely realize how SIMPLE it is to do TLOU right on screen, and the reason is obvious - It is just a reverse conversion. \n\n**The vast majority of gaming materials are not suitable for high quality tv/film adaptations, and to suggest that is to disrespect both medium of entertainment.** Games are largely an interactive and visual entertainment, executed through tropes that feel great to play but look terrible on screen - think Mortal Kombat's Fatality moments, Doom's hell-blazing gunfights or Mario's quirky adventures. They were never devised to impress as part of an engaging story, to push for dramatic heights or to evoke human experience. Best case scenario, you have something like Uncharted, a middling genre flick that you watch and forget and go back to asking who tv/film producers \"don't get it\". TLOU's success offers no lesson to how we should have made Halo instead, for instance. If anything, it shows us how big the divide is between two very different forms of entertainment, and why it takes so long for us to see a \"perfect\" production. \n\nTo really cross that divide requires an exercise of creative liberty, the courage to depart from the game's established tropes formula. This is where video games face another disadvantage - **they are often held hostage by fans who cling on the tropes described above**. There have been attempts to really try to break the mould and explore new territories for both story and storytelling - the short-lived Resident Evil series on Netflix is a good example, and sure enough its experimental approach was widely panned by its targeted audience. \n\nAnyway, just some personal viewpoint, putting it out here for discussion for anyone's interested. Have a nice day!",
