        "text": "So, I'm writing alternate history. But I know that in real-life one of Brazil's biggest historical disadvantages has been the fact that the Cerrado (the Brazilian tropical savanna biome) has been largely useless for large-scale agriculture up to the 1960s.\n\nThere was both a socio-economic lack and a technological lack that, when solved, allowed the Cerrado to become the breadbasket of Brazil that it is today.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;Until the mid-1960s, **agricultural activities in the Cerrado were very limited, since natural cerrado soils are not fertile enough for crop production**, directed mainly at the extensive production of beef cattle for subsistence of the local market. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to Brasília has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region: From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental subsidy programs were launched to promote agriculture, with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region.As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.  \n**The Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, Embrapa, discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year.** The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equaling around five tons of lime per hectare. **This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area.** Researchers also developed tropical varieties of soybeans, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main soyabeans exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.  \nToday the Cerrado region provides more than 70% of the beef cattle production in the country, being also a major production center of grains, mainly soya, beans, maize, and rice.\\[33\\] Large extensions of the Cerrado are also used for the production of cellulose pulp for the paper industry, with the cultivation of several species of eucalyptus and pines, but as a secondary activity. Coffee produced in the Cerrado is now a major export.\n\nThis all was made possible by the gradual transfer of technology from advanced countries such as the US and Europe to the Global South in the 1950s onwards, iirc.\n\nNow, I don't think the development of tropical varieties of temperate crops such as soybeans could happen before genetic manipulation becomes a thing, and it does right from the 1960s onwards. But what about industrial methods to lower the acidity of the soils with lime and phosporus? What about large-scale, mechanized, industrial agriculture? I'm sure those technologies did exist in the Global North before they reached the South. What I don't know is how long did more developed countries have them.\n\nSo, think of a world where, everything else being equal, Brazil is an advanced country like the US and Europe and, thus, had access to such technologies as early as they had. How much earlier can the Cerrado be transformed into the valuable and productive agricultural land it is today?",

        "text": "So Maier has a pretty big opus on ratification. I am currently reading it.  \"Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788 \"\n\n\nIt is well researched and in depth. But I am curious if there are any critiques. Her school of though is heavily influenced from the  likes of Wood, Bernard Baiylin and other \"neo-whig\" school of thought. \n\nThis school largely counters the thoughts of those like Charles Beard and other \"progressive\" historians, who thought constitution largely reflected economic interests of the founders and other wealth land owners. \n\nThe issue: Maier's writing style is such that she builds suspense by writing the issue without mentioning future event. So outside of introduction, there is no reference to other scholarship in text. \n\nAnd there is plenty written by Beard, and others like Woody Holton on the constitution prior to the release of ratification, I struggle to find any response or critique in the aftermath. \n\nIf any progressive historians are reading, there is a need for a book on ratification that challenges the neo-whig school that can cite Maier's excellent book.  Since her book is arguably the most comprehensive history of the subject, I think a book that can cite it would be useful. \n\nLink to Maier's book: https://www.amazon.com/Ratification-People-Debate-Constitution-1787-1788/dp/0684868555",

Like, 10 sestertii is 10 sestertii, silver has no intrinsic value, why would a silver plated coin minted by the imperial government be worth any less than a pure silver coin? Is this just mass psychology where people tricked themselves into thinking silver has intrinsic value cause it’s what money is made of? Did the debased coins break down quicker or something? Was the debasement not the problem in itself but just opened the door for inflationary monetary policy? Something else?",

While I was intrigued by the main points of the podcast, the opening description got me curious about how international travel worked at this time.  I imagine Gautier was fairly wealthy at this time, so I don’t think he was worried about affording the trip.  However, I could see a lot of logistical complications with traveling to another city in foreign empire that has uneasy relations with your own country (after all, France had taken Algeria from the Ottomans only a couple decades before Gautier’s trip). \n\nSo, how would Gautier have planned his trip?  Did he need to exchange currencies, or would French currency at the time been accepted in Ottoman markets?  Did he need to contact a place in Istanbul ahead of time to secure lodging, or could it be expected that he would find lodgings available there?  Did he need to plan travel via steamboat ahead of time, or could he just hit any port, confident that a ship would be heading East relatively soon?  And, once there, how would he communicate with the locals?  Could he anticipate an interpreter would be there, or did he have to bring someone along?  How would he be able to ensure a ship back home?  Finally, were there any equivalents of travel guides that could help him with all this planning?\n\nSorry if this seems like a long list of questions, I’ll take any answers that can touch on even portions of anything I’ve asked, but thank you for taking the time to read and answer!",

        "text": "The reason I ask is because in antiquity, slaves themselves seem to have unofficial social strata based on their apparent usefulness. In Rome, a highly educated Greek tutor and a common laborer could both be slaves, but it seems that each slave would be worth something different. Slaves could earn, buy, or be granted their own freedom, but it's not clear to me how this worked. If a slave is property, then property can't \"buy\" itself, right? Would it require the owner's permission? Could a slave effectively be more wealthy than a free citizen? Did slaves have any rights, or perhaps certain \"strata\" of slaves?\n\nThis isn't something that you see in popular depictions of slavery in the American South, which of course due to recency bias is what many of us think of when we think of slavery. \n\nMore importantly, what's the functional distinction between a slave, versus an indentured servant, versus other types of workers who were bound in contracts or to the land in such a way that they would have no real freedom to leave? Because depending on what region you read about, it seems like serfs were worse off than slaves of antiquity.\n\nAncient Chinese and Middle Eastern eunuchs and concubines are also of interest, since there are historical accounts of these kinds of people who \"legally\" appear to be slaves, but were able to wield a vast amount of political power.\n\nBonus Hypothetical: Since ancient slavery was not race-based, how would someone \"know\" if you were a slave, versus a freedman, versus just a foreigner? \n\nLastly, if anyone has any references on the historical institutions of slavery around the world, I'd be happy to look into them.",

However, a lot of these get born out of \"wisdom after the fact\", as you know, it seems logical that this happened at this time, and it all feels connected, WOW IT\"S A CONSPIRACY. For example, what reminded me of this and triggered to ask this question is a MH17 conspiracy that links it with MH370 disappearance (I know that it doesn't fit the 20 years rule, just using it as an example). A quick refresh, there were two catastrophes of Malaysian Airlines in 2014, first, a Boeing disappeared over the ocean (MH370), then another Boeing was shot over the Donbass (MH17). The conspiracy (one of those surrounding the flights) was that bodies and remains of MH370 were used to \"stage\" MH17, to the point of \"frozen bodies should've been loaded onto the plane rigged to explode\". You can see how this theory could've appeared - without access to the bodies, a regular news reader can think \"it's a suspicous coincidence that these two caatstrophes coincide, it doesn't happen without a reason\" and then it's \"obvious\" for any fan of thrillers and abrupt twists.\n\nSo, that's why I have a question: were there similar theories about events in the past that seemed a mere coincidence, then started out as a conspiracy, and then actually new research or facts supported the \"conspiracy\", and it was not a conspiracy anymore? Could the Trojan dig site be considered an example (I read recently here that it was not the sensation we are led to belive from the current school education)? Maybe Lusitania crash (I see on Wikipedia that there's no conclusion on the origin of the second blast, so maybe it's still an open conspiracy)?",

I'm curious as to why this is. \n\nI asked an American friend who's lived in Poland for the past ten years, and his answer basically boiled down to \"the Irish speak English.\" This strikes me as a pretty decent reason, but I'm curious if it's the whole story.

        "text": "This is a bit of a follow up from yesterday, where I asked about why is World War 1 given the title of the First World War despite there being other global conflicts. Thanks for the links to answers, btw, they were very interesting. \n\nThe answers, though, got me thinking. One of the answers referenced how WW1 was the first time where a war between (mostly) European powers had resulted in large scale fighting outside Europe. Of course there were conflicts outside Europe in the 7 years war and Napoleonic wars, but these were not anywhere near the scale of fighting in Europe. \n\nI do not doubt that the scale of fighting outside Europe in WW1 was immense, but I was wondering how important was it? For example, what impact did the fighting in colonial Africa have on the outcome of the war? Was there ever any chance of those conflicts being decisive in the War? What was the reason for the colonial powers to feel they needed to conduct large scale campaigns away from Europe? It’s an area of the War I think is often overlooked. I certainly know next to nothing about it. Being schooled in the UK, we learn a lot about WW1, but almost exclusively that focuses on the Western Front, with maybe a brief mention of Gallipoli, Lawrence of Arabia, and perhaps a small mention of the Russian Revolution. \n\n(I also want to quickly say, I don’t know if this is a historically accurate view, but in my mind the naval conflicts in the Atlantic, such as the u-boat campaigns, while not actually taking place in Europe, were extensions of the European conflict. The aim was to starve opponents in to submission.)",

Time a seamstress would have to spend to sew different sorts of garments, from shirts, to dresses to Tabards, or Tunics, Coats, really anything. \n\n2. Time it takes to translate the raw materials(like cotton), into string, or cord(what would be the correct term?then into cloth, and them actual clothes.\n\n3. Did peasants, or really just poorer folk usually make their own clothes completely if they had a farm, or did they buy the materials from a store? \n\n4. If they didn’t, what “richness” level would someone have to get to before they would purchase entire garments, the cloth pre sewn, or just purchase the materials?",

I'm sure it's obvious, but I need the clarification.\n\nThe US stance of \"self-determination\" still led to tons of money and support flowing to the mujahideen and the eventual collapse of Najibullah, but my question is why? The Soviets had pulled out and their country was collapsing. Why make the choice at all? Why not just let them figure it out? What was the true advantage of having the rebels gain control of the country? Was there fear that a win by the in-place Afghan regime would provide another chance for the Soviets to expand into the country?\n\nThis book is super dense, so i apologize to Mr. Coll if I missed something.
