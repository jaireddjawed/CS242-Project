        "text": "Recently started to consider upping my game on a watch purchase after my Seiko SNE039's date complication started malfunctioning. Coming from knowing little-to-nothing, it gave me good reason to start learning about watches more deeply and finding a replacement for daily wear. I was fascinated pretty quickly at the idea of having a mechanical/automatic timepiece. I also really wanted to find a case 36mm or under as the Seiko always felt tad big at 37 but was the smallest solar in store at the time. I wound up buying the smallest readily available automatic watch I could find in the $300 range-- a Kuoe Old Smith 90-002 (no date). My girlfriend visited Japan last year and spoke volumes of their attention to detail and quality so it seemed like an easy decision. So far, so good, love the size and style and watching the sweeping seconds hand is mesmerizing.\n\n\\[ For something just a bit more fancy, I've been contemplating buying one of the green dials of either the Vaer 36mm or the Traska Commuter... open to opinions but leaning toward the Vaer because the lug-to-lug is smaller. Obviously both sell out super quickly so I don't mind playing the sit-and-refresh game. \\]\n\nHowever, my real question for y'all who have been in the watch game for years, and the more primary reason for this post, is do you think in the coming years that companies will offer up more 36mm and under cases in the $500 price range? Glycine, Lorier, and Orient seem to have great, albeit sometimes limited, options already but I've been torn between waiting a bit or picking up one of the aforementioned 2 watches. I should note that I'm strictly talking about new purchases as opposed to peeking down the rabbit hole of buying used.\n\nMy tiny wrists thank you all for your feedback.",

The colors kind of match, the watch face is similar to the classic Porsche logo colors. The 30 minute chronograph lets me time my free charging at Electrify America stations, because I'll be damned if I pay a dime to charge this thing.\n\nBetter this than some weird Porsche Design watch that the recently divorced 50 year old dudes wear to match with their Porsche Design sweater while they hit on 21 year old daughter's friends.

With that said, I am hesitant to pull the trigger since there are no DOXA ADs in Los Angeles for me to try it on before purchasing so I am looking for your help!\n\n1. With my mighty 6.5 inch wrist size on a good day, I am wondering if this watch might be too large at 42 mm even with the shorter 46 mm lug to lug.\n2. BOR bracelet is bit too blingy for me and I usually wear my watches on leather straps. I Googled to get an idea how it would look on leather but there are essentially no photos of Sub 200 on leather straps.\n\nI would appreciate feedbacks/photos from members with smaller wrist and/or those who wear the Sub 200 on leather straps.\n\nLastly, if you're an owner of Sub 200, live in Los Angeles and willing to let me try on your watch over a cup of joe, the coffee is on me. Maybe even a pastry!\n\n*Photo Credit: Worn &amp; Wound*",

They had it marked down from 5200 to 2600, and said that it doesn't come with the original box unless you make a $100 donation to St Jude (odd but given the discounts not too bad). They had a railmaster that was significantly less discounted (only like $600 off I think).\n\nThey called all their Omegas now \"new old stock\" and marked as pre-owned because they aren't an AD anymore, but they said all the ones they had were brand new.\n\nJust wanted to let people know, also if there's a better sub for this ([r/watchexchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchexchange/) maybe?)
