I've also found out that not every employer sees a years worth of interning experience as being worth much at all in terms of their calculation of 'years of work experience'. So that worries me a bit, on top of the fact that I'm less connected in my home state than I am to my current location.\n\nThere's an open position for the county of one of these cities, for an Associate Planner. The job description is similar to every Planner 1 position I've seen, but the pay is only about 35k a year. I had anticipated finding something that pays more than that. What do you all think, I know it doesn't hurt to apply, but I made more than that a year as a restaurant server. How should I be thinking about this?",

        "text": "**OP UPDATE: 4/26/2018 - Sorry I've been away! After a first couple rounds of back and forths on the day of the initial post 10 days ago, I've been seriously grateful and hugely impressed by the strong response, and in part due to the all the effort and thought put into all your responses, I keep putting off another big round of replies thinking i need to set aside special time to research and reply, and...well the thing keeps snowballing away from me as the number of replies goes up. Nonetheless, I promise I will get back to ya'll in here, so I'm just leaving a note for now to say I haven't forgotten, and I take your responses, and the ongoing dialogue seriously. Apologies for the delay, but things have gotten a bit unexpectedly hectic the last week (I've started my first college class in 15 years and things got complicated with transcripts and modules and boy has the college experience changed since 2003), so anyway I'm just trying to carve out some time to get far enough ahead in class reading so I can sit uninterrupted for like 6 hours to reply to ya'll with appropriate research and thoughtfullness to your replies. Again, thank you.**  \n\nAfter a recent series of civic disappointments which I'll leave out for today, I've decided to run for City Council in my home town of ten years: Santa Monica, CA, USA. \n\nme irl:\nwww.linkedin.com/in/mehatch\nwww.mehatch.com\n\nOne major concern I have is about potential changes to arterial streets with [traffic calming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming) measures and dedicated bus lanes. Obviously, in residential neighborhoods, these methods can increase safety and create a greater sense of community, but on arterial streets such as Lincoln Blvd Link: \n\nhttps://www.smgov.net/Departments/PCD/Plans/Streetscapes/Lincoln-Neighborhood-Corridor-Plan-(LiNC)/\n\nI'm concerned they're a bad idea, and will reduce LOS despite [reports generated by the planners.](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/PCD/Plans/Streetscapes/Envision-Lincoln/Lincoln_Median_Traffic_Analysis_v4_11-10-15_FINAL.pdf)\n\nIn section 6.2 of that document, they claim simulations show traffic calming won't effect LOS, but I'm skeptical. The numbers regarding wait time in the following grid seem almost copy pasted. In an already super-congested artery, I just can't see how reducing lanes and overall traffic flow space will help with the commute, which seems like common sense...but common sense is lame if not backed up by data, which Is kind of why I've come to the /r/urbanplanning community.\n\nAny advice you can give a curious aspiring public servant on this topic? I don't want to get set-in-stone on something if my initial leanings against traffic calming on arterials here might be off-base. \n\nFor a larger context, there's been [significant local controversy](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/02/22/venice-boulevard-road-diet/) here recently about road diets in other arterials in the West Side of LA, which were more clear-cut cases of reducing arterials by entire lanes, but this more subtle traffic calming planned in Santa Monica I still think might not be a great idea, especially given the ability of traffic apps like Waze to direct traffic through residential areas during arterial congestion, thus raising rates of pollution and potential for accidents in those residential areas. \n\nOne last important item in the interest of transparency is that I'm likely working in partnership with www.keeplamoving.com but I'd like to know if you find any flaws in their [analysis](https://www.keeplamoving.com/) of these recent road diets on other local arterials. \n\nAnd for what it's worth, I'm a moderator of www.reddit.com/r/changemyview and I come here genuinely in the spirit of that subreddit, with the door open to data that could change my POV. I'm also a bicycling enthusiast who's also been personally impacted by pedestrian death, so I'm not coming at this without empathy for the POV of those wanting to implement road diets, but in the big view, I'm still very skeptical that they're a good idea when applied to arterials.\n\nThanks for any advice. \n\nCheers. \n\nedit1 4:52pm pst: I accidentally put \"road diets\" in 'scare quotes' which is just always super lame in any argument, brain fart I guess, anyway I've removed them.\n\nedit2 4:55 pm pst: fixed LiNC link\n\nedit3: LiNC Link had a parenthetical at the end that didn't play nice with reddit, so i just posted the whole link w/o hyperlink fanciness\n\nEdit 4: 830 pm pst: Its getting later where I am and have to finish some things before the week gets off to a start. Hugely appreciative for the many many responses, and I will reply in kind in the coming week. Apologies to anyone I didnt get to respond to tonight, but thanks for now on the great education tonight.

We have created an Subreddit specific email, that only /u/spacks and myself, /u/squishy33 have access to - rurbanplanning@gmail.com \n\n2. Using your **work email**, send an email to - rurbanplanning@gmail.com - **Title** should be Verification; the **body** of the email should contain just your Reddit Username. \n\n3. Once the email has been set, either myself or spacks will review it - verify you -  and flair you.\n\n**Why this Way**\n\n* This is completey optional to all users.\n\n* Our goal was to find the most efficient route, with the least invasive measure to verify **professional planners**. While the users of this subreddit will be removing anonymity of themselves to two mods, they will still maintain that anonymity on Reddit, the Subreddit, and with the remaining mod team. \n",

I am currently in the process of deciding which school to attend in order to become an urban planner. I am stuck between two choices and was hoping some of you may be able to help me out.\nSchool A: Diploma would be a M.S. in Sustainable Communities. \nThis Diploma involves the following core courses:\n\n* Sustainable Communities I/II\n\n* Research Methods\n* Water Resource Management\n* Retail Geography\n* Environmental Health and Hazards\n* GIS for Planners\n* Urban Planning I/II\n\nWith this diploma I would also be acquiring an additional certificate in Watershed Management or in GIS (or possibly both)\nThis overall program is not an accredited by the PAB.\n\nSchool B: Diploma would be a M.S. in City and Regional Planning. With this diploma I would also be acquiring a GIS certificate. This program is accredited by the PAB\nThe main reason why I am not going to school B is because of the cost. \n\nMy main question is, would I be able to attend school A and still be able to work as an urban planner and eventually take the AICP certification exam? Has anyone had a similar experience and would be able to share? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!\n",

While working odd jobs and internships in between, I have attempted to apply to masters programs but have been rejected because of my grades. \n\nIt's getting to the point where I'm considering applying to do a second bachelor's in Planning at a local school, but I'm wondering if that would at all hinder me or look bad when I eventually look for a job?\n\nIn my off time I am learning how to use design based softwares as well as learning how to draft landscapes for fun. I am hoping my abilities will help me get into a program in the future. \n\nI really like the aspect of planning and policies and prefer the policy based stuff in Planning compared to design. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot move away to go to a school further away (outside ontario) because moving away from my family severely impacts my mental health. \n\nDoes any one have any advice?\n\nThank you!",
