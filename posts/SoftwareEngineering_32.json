Here are some of the design specs I'm considering:\n\n* The aquarium itself is a singleton: there's only one instance of it at any time. \n\n* I have a list of eligibility criteria for what type of plants or animals that go into the aquarium. For instance, I'd like four different types of fish: one-fish, two-fish, red-fish, blue-fish. But if I have a red-fish, I wouldn't be able to add a yellow-fish. Or if I add a certain type of seaweed, I __must__ add the type of fish that lives in or eats the seaweed. These criteria must be evaluated prior to adding an entity into the aquarium.\n\n* At the end of the day, when I apply the `evaluate()` function to the aquarium, it should be able to tell me: what plants or animals are included and which are excluded. (This seems like: (A) decide whether what I am adding is a plant or animal, this will be my base class; and (B) if the entity added has any special characteristics, extend the base class.)\n \nIs there a name for this design pattern/architecture? It's sort of like a hub/spoke design?\n",

        "text": "I'm okay at math, not very good or brilliant.I had taken up computer science coding courses(With Phy,Chem,Math) in grade 11 and 12 and I fairly enjoyed them. I always thought I'd get a tech degree because stuff like AI and machine learning just seemed really cool but now that I'm reading more and more I'm understanding the realities associated with it. I'm more of a hardworking person than a logical one, I'm a top student who gets grades by working my ass off. I'm dedicated and ambitious but not inherently good at logical puzzles so I dont think i'll be good at higher level calculus, tricky programming questions. Thinking about technical interviews scares the shit out of me. I'm really interested in learning about business, finance but after reading so much about technology getting a degree in those other subjects seems.. kinda superficial as compared to something like computer science. However I know for a fact that if i get into the software engineering field there's always going to be programmers who are way way better and smarter at coding than I will ever be since they've been coding since they were kids and have immense passion for it. Still, I feel like I'll lose such an edge if I dont do CS or SEng because technology has such a huge scope in the future I dont want to feel left out but I guess the tech field doesn't really need someone like me. Something about me is that I really love reading books, whether it's business biographies or the future of technology and I'm a very practical person but I'm not sure where my capabilities lie. If anyone has any perspective to share on this please do. PS: I do know the difference between CS and SEng, I was confused as to what I should go for if I want to because I've heard that most CS grads anyways take all the SEng jobs and have done more intricate math so have an upper hand than the SEng grads, I'm not sure how true that is.",

Even after getting to a common understanding on the actual problems we are trying to solve, I still find myself getting this response sometimes.  It’s not foreign for me to understand that business just want to know the solution to a particular problem. How much it will cost and what the alternatives are. But tech is exploring all of that and making assumptions in their behalf. More often than not, technical people are left to understand the problem in its entirety.\n\nIs this something I’m experiencing personally or is it a common thing? If it’s me, how do I change it?",

My concentration in my undergraduate studies were in computational biology and since then I've realize I am more interested in software development than the biology aspects of the field. I am stuck on how to proceed from here because I am worried I do not have enough \"hard CS\" experience to compete with other applicants. I am currently applying for jobs.\n\nShould I look for a temporary job in bioinformatics to obtain more programming experience? Will this pigeonhole me in bioinformatics?\n\nShould I instead pursue a Master's degree in CS to obtain better credentials on paper? Would I even qualify as a M.S. applicant?\n\nIf I apply to software engineering jobs, are there any projects I can take on by myself to show on paper that I have improved my programming skills and am capable of working there?",

My long term goal is to be a software engineer in the US, getting into the nitty gritties of the implementations.\n\nJob #1: Lead front end developer position for a research project funded by the Japanese aerospace agency. Project seems fascinating and there seems to be a lot of prestige. However Japan doesn't pay very well compared to the states, and government grants do not pay as well as VCs. It is also a year by year contract (with a maximum of 2 years (the length of the project)).\n\nJob #2: Service engineer position. Some time coding some upper level stuff and some time talking to clients. People are really nice. They pay a competitive US salary.\n\nIf it wasn't a 20K+ difference in salary, I'd happily jump on a plane to Japan. But I don't know if the prestige or experience is worth that difference. Would love/appreciate any advice and stories about your career paths.\n\nThanks",

Since this is for a class, I would need to record it so that I can provide a transcript of the interview.  Please message me if you are interested.
