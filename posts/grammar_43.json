My second thought was that I never heard of \"yet another + plural\". Google only brought me to examples with numerals, as in: It's acceptable/ok to use it like this \"yet another three books\".\n\nBut what if I don't have a direct numeral and only the noun in plural? Is it viable/good English? \n\nIf not, what's a good alternative? I really like the sound of \"yet another\", implying the previous work of this person also achieved the masterpiece status. I feel that writing \"some other masterpieces\" doesn't acknowledge the art so much as \"yet another\". Thanks in advance.",

Like, would anyone ever say \"X-001 is an asthma therapeutic\"?\n\nI'm like 80% sure I've been using Therapeutics' for the 6 months I've been at this job with no issues, but my boss just edited my most recent project to change all of the \"Therapeutics'\" to \"Therapeutics's.\" Either way, this is not a hill I want to die on, but I am now stuck in a spiral of self-doubt.\n\nThanks all.",
