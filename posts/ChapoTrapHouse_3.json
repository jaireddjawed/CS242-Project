They [Republicans] didn’t start thinking of the old common fellow till just as they started out on the election tour. The money was all appropriated for the top in the hopes that it would trickle down to the needy. Mr. Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn’t know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night, anyhow. But it will at least have passed through the poor fellows hands. They saved the big banks, but the little ones went up the flue.\n&gt; \n&gt; The economist John Kenneth Galbraith noted that \"trickle-down economics\" had been tried before in the United States in the 1890s under the name \"horse and sparrow theory\", writing:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mr. David Stockman has said that supply-side economics was merely a cover for the trickle-down approach to economic policy—what an older and less elegant generation called the horse-and-sparrow theory: 'If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.' \n&gt; \n&gt; [Trickle-down economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics)",
