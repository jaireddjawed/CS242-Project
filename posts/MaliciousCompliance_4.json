        "text": "My son has been potty trained for months. It took a lot of persuasion to get him out of nappies in the first place. We tried a lot of methods to get him out of nappies and were also working on the basis of he‚Äôll come out do them when he‚Äôs ready. Our problem was he was capable of going to the toilet but he wanted to use his nappy. So his nursery worked with us over a few weeks and we finally managed to get him to transition over. \n\nThe problem we then had was that he still refused to poop anywhere but a nappy. We had a few days where he would poop in the potty or toilet then he refused to go and would hold onto it all day until he got his night nappy on for bed time. He‚Äôd then squeeze it out and we‚Äôd have to change him. He was telling us he liked doing it in his nappy, was scared of the toilet, liked us cleaning his bum and all sorts when we tried to talk to him about why he should use the toilet. If we tried waiting him out, so not putting the nappy on until he had pood he would have an almighty tantrum (he doesn‚Äôt tantrum much so this was a big deal for him) or be inconsolable and then he would hold it in anyway. We ended up with him constipated a few times because of the withholding so we were really stuck on what to do. \n\nIn November we started a sticker chart to encourage him, if he got 10 stickers he could pick a reward. We don‚Äôt usually use sticker charts or rewards for certain behaviours but I was running out of ideas and patience. He got to 5 stickers and then decided he would rather just keep with nappies. We said if he wanted to use nappies for pooing then he couldn‚Äôt have his bed time dummy anymore. We were sure he would pick the dummy. He handed it over and never asked for it again. (This was a win for us because we were trying to work out how to get rid of the dummy for bed time anyway)\n\nRecently I spoke to the nursery about it to let them know that we were having this problem. The staff have been working with us again and have been speaking to him throughout the day about not using nappies anymore except when he‚Äôs asleep etc. He came out on Friday and said he didn‚Äôt want to use nappies anymore. We said great, let‚Äôs use your sticker chart again. If you can get 10 stickers we‚Äôll go to the toy shop and you can pick something for yourself. \n\nHere‚Äôs where it becomes malicious compliance toddler style. Between Saturday morning when he woke up and Sunday at 1pm he has earned those 10 stickers because he has gone to the toilet and squeezed out every single little nugget that he can. He even tried to claim 2 stickers for one visit because it broke in 2 on the way out.\n\nSo we‚Äôve been to the toy shop and he‚Äôs picked himself his reward because I am still proud that he‚Äôs started finally using the toilet. But at the same time I am worried about what he‚Äôs going to be like as he gets older if he can work this sort of thing out now. üòÇ",

        "text": "I‚Äôm a second year veterinary student. This is the time when we start our live surgery labs. We work in teams of three students (a surgeon, an assistant, an anesthetist), and are obviously overseen by certified specialists (anesthesiologists and surgeons) and many experienced vet nurses as well. \n\nWe have lectures 7am to 11am. Lunch is 11-12. Our lab begins at 12pm sharp. However, we were told we have the ‚Äúoption‚Äù to come to lab early and begin. It became VERY clear after the first week this is an expectation (not an ‚Äúoption‚Äù) that we will skip lunch, or eat during lecture, and come straight to the OR. \n\nDuring one lab, at 11:50am the anesthesiologist yelled at a student for a few minutes in the pharmacy area, while getting drugs for lab, for not having his patient ready and waiting in the induction room‚Ä¶ 10 minutes for lab even begins. And this group was set to induce during the last wave (normally 1 to 1.5+ hours into lab). There‚Äôs no reason to be an hour early when your group is final wave, being on time is sufficient, and they were actually still early.\n\nOur class has been getting berated by this anesthesiologist as well as some of the surgeons in this lab. Just as one example, a student surgeon asked for help. A surgical resident came over from another patient to help, and she was now not sterile. The resident told the student she was holding her forceps wrong, proceeded to grab them from her hands, and then made the student leave her patient on the table to re-scrub, re-gown, and re-glove, and open a new instrument pack. All because she wanted to ask a question. This is a common technique they will use on us when we‚Äôve done something incorrect to ‚Äúget us to remember it next time.‚Äù\n\nWell, the entire class is fed up with this. Our class called a meeting about it, and we all decided we are all going to start showing up to lab at 11:50 to 11:55am. Only 5 to 10 minutes early. Not for petty reasons either, but it‚Äôs a matter of patient safety as well. Several students have fainted from skipping lunch to go and operate instead. We were given 11-12 for lunch and we‚Äôre going to take all of our time. \n\nSo, that‚Äôs what we did. At 11:40am one of the surgeons came to our lecture hall, where the majority of us stay and eat lunch, and asked us why we‚Äôre not in lab yet. A student at the front of the room said simply, ‚Äúlab begins at 12 noon.‚Äù The surgeon gave us a long spell about professionalism and how we are being inappropriate and putting our patients at risk, and she left. The OR is a 2 minute walk from the lecture hall, so we finished lunch and all showed up around 11:55. \n\nThe clinicians were very mad about it, and reported our class to the dean, and so the dean called a school wide meeting about it. Some of our classmates spoke eloquently about our reasons and our actual patient safety concern, turning it right back on the clinicians citing patient safety. And, the school claims to care immensely about student mental health, since this profession has one of the highest suicide rates and our own class even suffered a loss, and cutting our break/lunch is no way to support us. Beyond that, the schedule says we begin at 12, and we are still showing up a few minutes early to ensure we can begin right at 12. \n\nUltimately, the dean just released a statement saying they cannot force us to begin lab an hour early, and we will start at 12 when the deans office scheduled lab to begin. It‚Äôs a small win for us, certainly we will face backlash, but we have a break to eat at least. Our class is known for not putting up with bs from the school, we got a dinosaur of a professor fired for racist comments she made to a student in the middle of lecture, after she had terrorized students at this school for decades, she forgot out lectures were automatically recorded on zoom during COVID. We‚Äôre hated by the clinicians, but at least the classes behind us are having a slightly better time.",

        "text": "This felt so good‚Ä¶\n\nI (40f) am married to D (53m) for 6 years. I have 3 children (m 10, 12, 13) and D has a son (16m).  For background info, I have sole custody of my children as their dad skipped town and moved to another state.  He has not seen them in about 5 years. For my SS16, D and his ex have 50/50 legal and physical custody. Everything is split right down the middle, including expenses.   No one pays child support.  \n\nThe ex tried to take him for primary custody and child support about 2 years after their split, but the judge said there was no reason to take custody away from my husband.  At the time, both of them made almost the same amount of $, so no child support order was issued.  (Child support is also based on the income of each party and not just how the custody is split). I think my husband would have had to pay something nominal like $39 a month and they don‚Äôt issue orders for anything less than $50 in our state.  \n\nNow the issue at hand‚Ä¶. Who claims SS on their taxes?  There was a verbal agreement in 2016 that she would claim him on even years and D would claim him on the odd years.  This worked well for 16, 17, and 18 - until 2019.  Ex claimed that she REALLY needed to claim SS bc she was broke, etc.  So, against my advice, D let her claim him with the condition that we would claim him 2020 and 2021.  I said GET IT IN WRITING.  Nope. D didn‚Äôt want to listen to me.  Nothing in writing.  üôÑ\n\nSo lo and behold, exactly what I told D would happen, happened.  She has claimed SS every year since. He gave in ONE time and she completely steamrolled him every year since.  Last year was the 4th year in a row she has claimed him.  She got all the extra stimulus payments for him during the pandemic, all the refunds for claiming him, but we are still sharing expenses and custody 50/50.  \n\nD really went off on her last year bc we really needed the extra money to pay off SS‚Äôs braces so I could take my son (12) to get his braces.  We couldn‚Äôt afford 2 payments a month for braces and our insurance doesn‚Äôt cover them so my son has had to wait.  She laughed and told him to F off bc it was her right.  She said there is no reason for us to claim SS bc we already claim my kids and she deserves to claim SS every year bc she is his mother.  (But we still have to pay for half of everything.) she said if we didn‚Äôt like it, we should ‚Äúdo something about it‚Äù.\n\nWe talked to our lawyer and the folks at family court, and they all said the same thing‚Ä¶. Being that custody is exactly 50/50, either parent can claim him and it‚Äôs whomever gets to it first.  She must have already known this and is why she literally laughed at D when he confronted her last year.  \n\nFFWD to 2023.  Tax season opened 1/23 and I had our taxes ready by 7am that day.  I filed our return claiming SS and it was accepted.  I know she knows but she hasn‚Äôt said anything to D.  The reason she won‚Äôt say anything is bc she got a new job a few months ago.  She his making 30% more than what my husband is making now and she knows that he can take her back to court for child support and she would have to pay him quite a bit per month.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. \n\nI fully intend to do the same next year. SS will need to file for federal aid for college with next years tax return and federal aid is income based.  I know the ex will not say anything this year but next year she will start squawking about the ‚Äúevery other year agreement‚Äù and how we are breaking it.  If she claims him next year and he has to use her tax return, he won‚Äôt get any student aid at all bc he is her only dependent.  He will get whatever he needs in aid if we claim him bc we have 4 dependents and D makes less than she does. üòÅ\n\nI‚Äôm not really looking for any advice.  I‚Äôm just enjoying not being steamrolled this year.  \n\nI took her advice.  She told us to do something about so I did something about it.",

I was one of them during my college years. \n\nThe fuel we had at the station was Unleaded bensin 95, 98 and 100. And Diesel.\n\nOne day, a regular customer came over. He was a taxi driver. I had seen him before, both with his taxi car, a Mercedes, and his private car, an Audi. The Mercedes, was a Diesel car and the Audi was bensin. Keep in mind, back then, every taxi in the country was running with Diesel.\n\nThat day, he came with the taxi. I've noticed he was a bit out of it but didn't comment on it. I asked how much he wants in the tank. He said, \"Full, unleaded 100.\" I looked at him strangely. \"You mean, Diesel?\"\n\n\"No, I mean Unleaded 100\"\n\n\"But sir, you have the...\" I didn't get the chance to point out he was driving his taxi. He goes \"Young girl, please. I know what fuel my car needs.\" I looked at him one more time, I was getting pissed at that point. \"Ok sir, full tank Unleaded 100. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you.\" \n\n\"Right away.\" And I proceed to put unleaded 100 in his Diesel car. He paid and left. \n\nTwo days later, he comes again on my shift with his Audi this time. I go out to greet him trying not to laugh at his face. \n\n\"What it's gonna be today sir? Diesel?\" I asked trying to bit my tongue. He eyed me carefully \"Unleaded 100, please. Full tank\" \"Are you sure?\" I asked and he side checked his car. \"Yes, thank you.\" \"Right away, sir.\" I fill his tank and as he was paying he adds \"Next time, I would appreciate it if you told me I was being and idiot and put in the correct gas on the tank.\" He said seriously but I could see the humor in his eyes.\n\"Was the damage that much?\" I asked. He groaned. \"You have no idea! Have a good day!\" And he left.\n\nI never found out what was the cost of the damage but for my duration at that gas station, when I was the one loading his car, he always would go like \"Full tank, please!\" Without saying what kind...",

Despite COVID still raging all around, restrictions were being lifted.   \n\n\nMy internship office had a strict work-from-office policy even though all our work can easily be done online. In the first week of January 2022, I developed cold symptoms. I immediately informed my team lead and senior associate, and requested permission to work from home. This wasn't even a request for time off since I was an intern eagerly trying to impress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy senior associate decided to have none of it. Being the brilliant manager (don't ask me about the management hierarchy. There isn't one) that he was, he refused to allow work from home. Everyone, including interns, must be in the office during work hours. COVID wasn't a concern because according to him, they would closely watch my symptoms by \"checking my temperature throughout the day\". Note: I took paracetamols to control my temperature until my COVID test results came in while all this was happening.  \n\n\nTwo evenings later, my COVID test returned positive. Because of exposure, everyone had to work from home for the next two weeks. Turns out more people were also positive at the same time. While everyone had to return to the office in February, interns were expressly instructed to work from home for another month.",

The mobile area where hoardes of greedy shoppers is where I was sentenced, people as far as the eye can see all standing and starting a whole in me.  I'd done several set ups and my next couple (mid 20s) came forward.  As I cant leave, I get to hear stories about their life as we go through all the paperwork and get their new phones.   \n\n  The guy had already been making rude comments about the wait, the cost of accessories, and getting on my nerves. \nWe used to have a machine that we hooked to phones and it transfered all the data to the new phones, well it didn't get the memo we worked today and broke a few hours into our shift.  I take the woman's new iPhone and set her up by transferring her data from the old phone to the new phone.  It's been about an hour at this point and I'm ready to set up guys phone and he hands it to me.  I go down the list of stuff making sure to get his iPhone library, contacts, imessages, etc.  I start to notice the  guy has alot of pics with him and another woman who did not look like his fiance.  \n\n  I snicker as it's none of my business and continue loading everything to icloud .  Now the fiance has gotten bored and wants to go and she's complaining about how loud it is. The guy starts yelling at me to hurry up and really pissing me off. \nThroughout all of this I remain calm and finally get all his stuff over, I let him know I didn't link his fiance to the icloud account and he can do that himself.  He gets upset and tells me I'm not doing my job.\n\nCue MC\n\n He tells me to sync the shared albums on icloud bc they have to go.  I tell him trust me you should do it yourself.  He grabbed the phone and did it himself.  He hits share and all he'll breaks out when his fiance starts to see all the pictures of him with this other woman.   She screams for a solid minute, he said I put the photos of this woman on his phone.  He has no answer for the woman he's in the pictures with. She storms out after throwing her ring somewhere in electronics.   He looks at me, and I said I told you, not to do it.   I do get shoved off of my bench to the floor and the manager kicks him out.   Keep in mind we have 100s of people in the store, probably 40 in the mobile area watching this and it was dead quiet.  \n\nWish I could say that's the first ruined relationship I've see  from icloud shared albums lol.",

        "text": "Another subreddit comment jogged my memory about this and I thought you'd appreciate it here.\n\nIn my late teens I worked for the jobcentre.  I was sitting in observing an employer interviewing for warehouse jobs. My role was to confirm the attendees were responding seriously rather than just to keep getting benefits.\n\n My checklist was specific, just a numbered list with \"check yes or no, did they answer x question in full.\" 15 questions. Nothing personal about the client like how they present themselves or the content of their answers.\n\nWe had one client who had been unemployed since before my birth-Mr P. Not incapable of working,  he just didn't want to. Nice enough chap, and very well educated. \nSadly for him he'd been informed that if he didn't attend this job interview his benefits would cease for 26 weeks.\n\nIn he trots to his mandatory interview. It'd obviously been raining because he was rather soggy, and smelt like when you open a tent thats not been used for a long time.\n\n He's wearing full cammo gear, a baseball cap saying \"bad girl looking for a good time\" whilst pulling a shopping trolley filled with newspapers wrapped in twine. He's also wearing leather sandals with socks.\n\nHe proceeds to remove his sandals and very wet socks, wrung them out over the carpet and carefully placed the socks on the radiator. \n\nBy this point the interviewing manager's chin is on the floor and I'm trying not to look anywhere but my own lap in case I start sniggering.\n\nThe guy answered all the interview questions perfectly normally, but interspersed the time between questions with comments like \"I just picked a raspberry seed from between my teeth, the last time I ate any was a good 6 months ago\" \n\nJust as they were about to end the interview and I'm internally congratulating myself on keeping my face neutral, he groaned, rubbed his knee and announced his cervix had cramp.\n\nI lost it and had to leave the room. He did not get the job, he also kept his benefits.\n\nFor some reason the employer began using a recruitment agency for their vacancies not long afterwards. \n\nRIP Mr P.  Well done on beating the system for so long.",

        "text": "Many years ago, I worked for one of the largest overnight package delivery services. I was efficient at my job and followed all the rules.\nAt the time, we were focused on expanding our international business.  Due to individual country customs laws, we had a handbook showing all requirements for a particular country.  This made processing international, non-document shipments extremely time-consuming. \nOne particular day (pre internet and cellphone) I'm working my regular route.  My onboard computer, which gives me my work orders for pickup, starts beeping like it's malfunctioning.   (2 P.M.)\nI look at the screen, and all my work is getting reassigned.  After clearing the message buffer, one stop(1 mile away and not part of my route) pops up. It's for 125 4 foot long rolled up billboards going to all parts of Europe for a movie premiere. \n\nI call my dispatcher and tell her wth? Why did you give me a bulk stop on Mr. Lazyass' route? Why can't he do it? Her answer- \"You know he always refuses to work late.\" I tell her, send me back my route and find someone else.  She said my boss told her to give it to me(not usually true, but was her standard response).  I call by boss, he confirms.\nMind you, I still had deliveries to finish. This bulk stop will take a minimum of 2 or 3 hours to process solo, so I tell my boss I can't do it on time on site and get back to the hub in time.  He says, \" There is nobody else available. Do the best you can.\"\n\nI finish my deliveries and arrive around 3 at the location.  The shipper hands me a stack of waybills and points to the pile of the rolls on the floor.  I was pissed before I arrived. Now I'm fuming.  I call my  dispatcher requesting backup.  Same reponse. No one is available, but I  will try to get you someone.(NEVER GOT THE BACKUP) I hang up and  start mumbling, \"This  is bs!\" , so customer can't hear me.  \n\nWe are required to process packages at the customer location.  This is necessary in case of errors or missing paperwork.  Our delivery guarantees kick in as soon as we take packages off the customer location.  Each of these packages is worth over $100 in shipping revenue. ($15000 approximately)\n\n Cue MC\n\nSo I get to work. At 5 p.m. I'm not even half done.  I load everything in my truck, drive back to the hub,  and contact the manager on duty.  I dump the entire shipment on the floor as instructed.  10 coworkers decend on the pile.  Boss says I can go home.  I do my closeout routine(20 minutes). I walk past the swarm of coworkers processing the pile.\n\nThe next morning, I  get called into the hub manager's office. She asks what happened.  I explained as I did above.  She says that the client was so important that they made our plane wait an extra 30 minutes, costing us $10k and that she had to write me up. \n\nI responded.  \"I followed all company policies and was instructed by my direct boss to do my best. I did just that. I don't believe it is fair to get punished for working as directed.\"\n\nShe looks at me and says, \"You're right. You can go. Just make sure there is no 'next time'.  No write-up,",

        "text": "I used to work as a food receiver in a retirement home kitchen.  I won't say name, but I WILL say it sounds vaguely Nordic.  When I took over as Food Receiver in the primary kitchen, didn't have much training.  I was just told \"you helped the previous guy, you know the most, job is yours now.\"  Over the next almost 8 years, got that place maximized for peak use of space. Every now &amp; then we would get a new head chef, and they always made the mistake of trying to run it like a restaurant.  Usually in about 2 weeks they'd realize that it was a different vibe &amp; tone, and adjust accordingly.  \n\nHad a great head chef as a boss for about 5 years.  He knew that since deliveries were food and to some degree perishable, my schedule needed to be a little fluid and flexible to account for late deliveries while not having me rack up overtime.  We worked out a great system where i basically set my own hours and got everything done.\n\nFast forward to a regime change. Head chef was a tool, but with him came a woman whose job title was never told to ANY of us in the kitchen, we were just told she outranked all of us.  First thing she did was decide I would no longer have a fluid schedule.  My shifts would be posted on the board like all the others, 2 weeks in advance. I didn't like it, but ok.  Fair enough.  Cut to about 2 weeks later, i had to leave early for a dentist appointment.  That had been submitted and approved months ago.   I reminded her day before, AND day of.  Day after, she gives me a dressing down and a written reprimand for leaving before end of scheduled shift.  She told me she didn't care what happened before, she never had papers for this request.  \n\nLuckily for me, the head of entire dining department, even above head chef, told her that she HAD been given all those time off approved papers when she started, and if my shift didn't reflect , my pre-approved leaving early, it was her fault for not paying attention.  UNluckily, she decided to take it out on me.  Saying that \"from now on once schedule is posted, NO changes unless its in writing AND signed by both of us minimum of 2 days prior!  NO exceptions!\"\n\nI looked at calendar, and saw i'd get to have fun and get payback.   See, being a food receiver, a monthly job of mine was to due end of month inventory on ALL food, beverage, cleaning items.  I had actually created the inventory paperwork myself, so instead of being alphabetical the items were all listed together based on which area they were stored in.  Dishwasher chemical closet, freezer, dry food storage, soda syrup room, etc.  Meaning after a few months i could go room to room quickly, &amp; be done in less than 2 hours.  Catch was it had to be done either last thing last day of a month, or first thing first day of a month.  And could not do 2 in same month.  With no weekend deliveries, i worked Monday-Friday.   Now under the old cool head chef, if i had to do it on a Saturday or Sunday, i'd just come in and do it.  Then leave early on a slow day, cancelling extra hours.\n\nAnd lo and behold, this was one of those months.  Where inventory would have to be done on a Saturday or Sunday.  Days she had me down as OFF on the calendar.  I grinner like Tim Curry/Grinch in Home Alone 2 and waited.  Sure enough, last Friday of the month, she asks me \"Which day are you coming in to do inventory?\"  I told her i wasn't, I was scheduled off.  She goes into a tirade about \"it's your job\", \"you don't tell me NO\", \"I'll have you written up\", etc.  I calmly told her making the schedule was HER job and responsibility, not mine.  This earned me \"I don't care WHAT the schedule says, you're coming in this weekend!\"  To which i sweetly &amp; sarcastically asked if she had a paper signed by both of us AND dated no later than yesterday about us agreeing to this switch.  \"You know,\" I said, \"The policy YOU created when you got called out by head office for not properly handling my scheduled early shift?\"  \n\nIf smartphones had been commonly around in 2009, I would've taken a picture of her face.  I found out from weekend crew it took her almost an entire day to do it herself.   That was first of many times she found out that fun way that about half the tasks i did under old regime were technically NOT required by my work position, I just did them when I had extra time to help a boss i respected.",

        "text": "Since we're sharing our McDonald's experiences, here's mine. I worked at a small-ish McDonalds in and around 2005 which was situated in the parking lot of a big box store complex. I covered mainly lunch shifts during the summer before transitioning to night shifts after school started back up. I hated all the other part timers because they were lazy butts, while the lunch crew were a bunch of retired old ladies who needed extra money for bridge gambling. But that's another story.\n\nIt was a rainy Tuesday when a guy wearing a blue and red jacket stormed in and ordered thirty two cheeseburgers. If you've ever worked in fast food you know that the fryer is only so big. You can fry about twelve regular burger patties at once if you absolutely jam them in there, but at the McDonalds I worked at we segregated our friers so we had one dedicated to chicken and fish products, one dedicated to meats- and a third of the meet fryer was dedicated to 'no salt and peper'. Normally  burgers come with salt and pepper put on during the frying process, but some people who frequented our store were allergic, so we had a separate off area for that. This meant we could only do eight patties at a time. \n\nTo further cause issues, this guy arrived in the middle of our dinner rush, so we already had orders frying up, and our stock of existing burgers was already out. I'm in the Kitchen and I immediately threw more burgers on the fryer- but after that, it was just a waiting game. I can hear this irate burger man ranting at the staff. Our manager would've beat his ass if she'd been there, but we only had a supervisor and after the man made her cry I, as the most experienced worker on shift stepped in to keep things going. I went out front and told the man that we were making the burgers as fast as we could, but obviously there are limits- limits he told us to fuck ourselves with. He then went on a rant about how he needs these burgers to feed his kid's soccer team, and they're waiting in the bus for their dinner. I indicated that we did do catering orders, but we have a phone number precisely for that. He continued to rant at me about how he needed his burgers now and we should have just already had thirty two burgers already cooked and ready because didn't we know that sometimes people just need thirty two burgers and blah blah blah. \n\nSo I went back and made his burgers, loaded them all up, and handed them over. He took the burgers and then fixed me with a smirk and went \"Where's my Philly Cheesesteak?\". This was at the time we had a deli counter, something that has long since been phased out. This ingrate did not order a Philly Cheesesteak, and we both knew it, but he kept circling back to a 'The Customer is always right' comment and demanded he had and we'd just forgotten it and he demanded that he MUST GET HIS CHEESESTEAK. That he didn't pay for. He threatened that he'd demand his money back if we didn't get him his cheesesteak.   \n\n\nAlright fine. \n\nI was the only one in the store who could make Deli sandwhiches. It was super simple, everyone else was just inept or lazy or both. Normally we take two buns, run them through the toaster, throw on lettuce, take a packet of pre-mix philly cheesesteak, put in in the microwave, nuke for 2 minutes, then drop it on top, sauce it and go. This time I went through all the steps without nuking it, wrapped it all up nicely and handed it off to the guy with a smile. I'd even heated the bun like normal, so it looked just like a regular Philly, but the meat and cheese were an ice cold brick. \n\nThe guy headed off jauntily, got into his bus and presumably distributed his cheeseburgers, then drove off. I headed to the back to see how the supervisor was getting on- better, but she wanted to go home for the night. Now, while I was senior in the sense that I took on a lot of responsibiltiy and had experience with this kind of stuff, I was actually quite new to that store. I just had a reputation for not taking shit and being responsible. So I wasn't actually authorized to close up the store. \n\nStill, I conferred with the other staff, we rang up the actual manager- and got approval to close early. So we get everything ready and done, pack up, and begin closing up the front- and the bus and a very angry man in a red and blue jacket pull in. He practically leaps down from the bus and races across the parking lot towards our door. \n\nAt which point I smile at him, lock the door, and turn the open sign off. Then closed the blinds and we all filed out the back.\n\nHe was still beating on the door as we got into our cars and left.",

Well the manager of this factory, I can only assume has the world's tiniest penis and feels the need to stamp his authority whenever he gets a chance. His number 2 is the lap dog type who just blindly follows what the big boss says even if it's an awful idea.\n\nI have way too many stories of ridiculous things that went on in my time there. Anyway as was usual at this place we all get pulled into the break room for a \"breifing\". Basically just where we all get told how rubbish we are and all the wonderful things the company does for us. His best example was \"like making sure we all get paid\" to which my response was well if you didn't, we wouldn't be here. So how is that doing such a great thing for us?\n\nThis particular week we are told for some reason that we have no respect for the facilities and keeping things \"lean\" because we have our water bottles put on the various desks throughout the shop floor. We asked for a designated place to put them then, to which we are told it's now a health and safety issue. So we all go back and forth questioning whether we aren't allowed to drink water on shift, obviously the boss and his lap dog see this is completely not allowed. So they say \"oh no but you have to go to the break room to get a drink if you feel thirsty\".\n\nVery well, every single one of us on shift will go to the break room to get a drink of water whenever we are feeling dehydrated. I was the supervisor at the time and got the other 2 supervisors on board with me. So told all of the guys that every one of them had to go get a drink at least once every 30 minuntes, to make sure they weren't dehydrated in this dangerous environment. Totalling about 14 or 15 drink breaks per man. Minimum. Each taking approximately 5 minutes by the time they leave their station and return. Loosing over 1 hour of production per man.\n\nWell obviously this had a major impact on the productivity of the line, by the second day I was pulled aside by the lap dog and told the guys were \"taking the piss\". I responded well they are only being responsible and looking after their own health and safety. That's what you want isn't it? You don't want someone passing out and causing an accident do you?\n\nThis continued for another 3 days or so before there was not only a complete U-turn of the drinks bottle situation but we used it to get the company to install water machines on every station in the factory. Apparently the so called Health and Safety issue was no lonnger an issue.\n\nIn the end the big bosses tiny ego, cost the company tens of thousands in production and thousands in water machine installations.",

        "text": "Retired attorney here. That means I'm no longer practicing, but I still feel the need after all these years to say: I'm certainly not your attorney and nothing in this post is meant to constitute legal advice or the formation of an attorney-client relationship.\n\nI used to practice in civil defense litigation - meaning, representing people and entities who were being sued for a variety of reasons. On the defense side, we bill hourly for everything we do, and typically round up in .1 hour increments - meaning, everything we bill for, no matter how short, is rounded up to the next 6 minutes.\n\nIn my early days of practicing, in order to cut down on client bills, I engaged in what is known in the legal world as \"block billing\". This means I would typically just record one block of time for all tasks I did on a case on a given day (emails, drafting things, etc.) That way, everything I did appeared as one time entry, and only that one entry was rounded up. It was easier for me to record time, and clients weren't faced with a million different time entries, all of which were rounded up.\n\nA couple of decades ago, there was a big push in my state against block billing. Articles began popping up about how it was unethical, the main argument being that an attorney could theoretically send a client a huge bill with no way for the client to reasonably discern how much each individual task took. Fair enough, I suppose. I ended up reaching out to my active clients about it and stating that, while I believed my billing was ethical and saved them money, I wanted to disclose recent opinions against it in case they wanted individual line item billing.\n\nMost of my clients were happy to continue as they were, but a couple demanded they switch over immediately. I cautioned them that this may result in higher bills. They didn't care. Okay, whatever you say.\n\nSo I started billing for every single thing I did. If I emailed a client, that was 0.1 hours. When they responded, I had to review it, another 0.1 hours. If they wanted me to review 4 separate documents, each was billed separately. And this was just client communication - every contact with opposing counsel, every draft of a paper to be filed in court, everything was billed separately.\n\nNeedless to say, client bills to those who wanted this nearly doubled in the next month. Of those clients, most would switch back to block billing immediately after receiving their monthly statements. Still, to this day, block billing is considered a bad practice. I'll never understand why.",

Standard pickles on the QP was 2 so extra was 4, that was the standard procedure at the time.  I slap four pickles on the sandwich, wrap it up, slide it into the warmer, and go onto the next order.\n\nAbout 30 seconds later a guy comes walking into the store carrying a sandwich and smacks it down on the counter.  He is visibly angry, probably intoxicated, and says \"How God Damn hard is it to put extra pickles on a sandwich?\"  The manager intercepts him from the cashier, apologizes, takes the sandwich, and asks me to make a fresh one with EXTRA pickles.  I do as I'm asked and make a fresh sandwich with 6 pickles this time, wrap it up, slide it into the warmer, and go onto the next order.\"\n\nThe manager hands angry man his sandwich and he immediately unwraps it.  He is not satisfied.  He begins ranting that we must all be mentally inept (In not so nice terms) to not understand his request for extra pickles.  The manager continues to apologize and asks me to make another with \"lots of pickles\".  I again do as I'm asked but instead of counting pickles, I take a literal handful from the dressing table and slap them on.  There is now more pickle than bread or meat on this \"sandwich\".  I wrap it up and slide it into the warmer.  This time I do not go on to the next order.\n\nI want to witness the result of my handiwork, so I stand peeking between the pie dispenser and warming cabinet to watch what transpires.  Again, he immediately unwraps the \"sandwich\".  However, this time instead beginning another rant, his visible anger fades and he stands there in silence.  The situation may have bene defused until the moment he looks up, locks eyes with me, and sees my stupid 17-year-old grinning face.  He is enraged.  He throws the sandwich at me and it hits the pie dispenser right next to my head.  The missile explodes in a shower of pickles and now everybody is yelling.\n\nIn the end angry man got a refund but he also got arrested and trespassed from the store.  I declined any charges but it turns out he was drunk and caught some charges for that.",

        "text": "Context, I work in IT in a very small area where everybody knows each other in one ay or another so networking with people in very important. I got a new job in a private school, partly because I knew the consultant acting hiring manager at the time, but also because he knew I had skills in Azure and it's many cloud components, which was the direction he envisioned the school going. Great stuff, I can do the migration no problem as I've gone through it twice at previous companies.\n\nI started just before the summer holidays (which were 9 weeks at this school, god damn that sounds bliss) so I spent a bit of time getting to grips with the equipment, network and just generally settling in. It was a small team of myself, 2 desktop guys (one part time) and the consultant/manager who worked 3 part days, usually about 10am-2/3pm. After about 3 months, the school hired a permanent manager and dropped the consultant after he had handed over all of his responsibilities. Things continued as normal, I worked away on getting the prerequisites in place while juggling some other projects like managed printing and network upgrades. Everything seemed great, although I was being pulled away from my cloud tasks more than I'd like but figured it was just how thing were here with such a small team.\n\nJump forward to December, my 6-month probation was due so I asked the managed (let's call her D) when we could have a meeting to discuss how things have been and sign off on my probation. She kept putting it off with generic excuses and it ended up happening in mid-Jan, where she absolutely destroyed me. Instead of talking to me like a reasonable human being, she held up all these micro-aggressions and spent over 30m unloading them onto me, absolutely crushing my motivation. She also said she doesn't believe the cloud is the right way to go (lol) and that I needed to be better at on-premise infrastructure and networking. I had specifically said during my interviews that networking is my weakest area and that I specialise in cloud computing, so essentially the role I am supposed to be doing has changed entirely to one that I'm not good at. She used this as a way to suggest extending my probation while she creates a new role for me that's more fitting as I don't have the networking skills she was looking for. I was visibly upset and she left me for a minute, but just before she left she said \"You need to think long and hard about if you want this job, because right now you're not performing well enough to keep it\".\n\nI sat there for about 20 minutes, alone in a side room near our office. Thoughts went through my head doubting myself, worrying about losing my apartment I bought just 6 months ago if I lost this job. Worrying what my family would think and just generally how I'd deal with what I felt like was an inevitability. I'd tried my best with everything I did and she STILL wasn't happy. So I thought about what she said - do I want this job? No.\n\nSo that night I signed up with all the local job agencies, frequently checked job sites and all the time I was at work, I acted like she'd helped me see my 'errors' and that I was working on them to prove myself to her. Actually I hated her guts and couldn't stand being in the same room as her. I hadn't taken any of my annul leave days as I had no money after spending all my savings on my apartment so I didn't see the point in taking time off to sit around. She nagged me about this CONSTANTLY saying I'd lose it if it wasn't taken blah blah blah (like I didn't already know how holidays work?). I booked a big block of 3 weeks at the end of May as we had family coming to visit - this is relevant later.\n\nAbout 2 months later, I booked a couple days holiday to attend an interview, obviously I just told her I fancied a long weekend. I got the job, not only was it more engaging and relevant to my area of expertise, but it was a tasty 7k pay rise with a bonus scheme up to 25% annually. Sweet, I come back in on Monday ready to hand my notice in but she's booked a meeting with me while I was off for 10am to \"discuss my new role\". I have my notice in an envelope and bring that to the meeting. She starts with pretty much saying \"you've gotten a bit better but still not good enough for this job so I'd like to propose-\" I cut her off and hand her the envelope. She opens it, reads it and says \"Oh. Okay, erm. Huh.\" She says \"Okay well your notice period is a month, so your final day will be 8th of June\". I counter with \"Actually, I think you'll find that while on my probation period it's actually only 2 weeks which brings it to the 25th of May, which is also a public holiday, as is the 24th so my last day is actually the 23rd of May.\". She tries to say I'd passed probation but I remind her of the letter I signed agreeing to the extension and that I hadn't signed any contract for this new role yet. A bit of back and forth and she finally concedes. I also remind her that I had almost the entirety of my annual leave which has to be paid to me when I leave. As the school was going through a big cost-saving exercise, this would look really bad on her. She asked me to take them instead of working my notice, which I declined. I'd rather tolerate her for 8 more days and get paid for a full month's pay on top of my normal salary. She reluctantly agreed and said she's going to go talk to HR and let them know.\n\nOn the way out of the meeting, I thanked her for helping me out in January. She looked at me confused so I reminded her that I \"needed to think long and hard about whether I wanted this job\" and I decided that no, I didn't and found a much better package elsewhere. Now I have my own office complete with coffee machine and mini-fridge, staff who work with me on projects and time to work on Azure features like I'm supposed to. All while getting paid considerably more. Thanks D!\n\nPS - she got the boot 3 months after I left, apparently she clashed with a lot of the teaching staff with here management style. Guess I wasn't the only one who didn't get on with her.\n\ntl:dr - management changed at my previous workplace, new manager changed my role expectations massively and tried to demote me while citing \"you need to think long and hard about whether you want this job\". I left, shafted her by taking a shorted notice than expected and getting paid out in full for my annual leave.",

        "text": "Over a decade ago now,  I worked for a government organization that required regular travel to attend meetings and conferences as well as work on overseas projects.\n\nWhen I started, there was a travel and subsistence list giving a 24 hour rate which you would receive no-matter where you stayed, or what you ate. From that you had to pay for all your hotel costs and meals.   This would be of the order of ¬£100 per day, with adjustments based on location etc... much more for expensive places like New York, much less for rural Africa (for example!)\n\nWe would be expected to book our own flights on the company credit card, and most people would make effort to use discount fares.\n\nAs employees this was great because you had the freedom to find somewhere nice and cheap, eat frugally and end up taking the extra cash home with you. Or you could stay somewhere posh, live it up and make up the difference yourself.\n\nAmong my peers, we would tend to stay somewhere cheap, save the cash and have a couple of crazy nights out so generally end up all square.\n\nAt some point they decided that this wasn't transparent enough and they could save money by only paying for exact expenditure from receipts, and booking hotels for employees without much choice. \n\nThe company also outsourced hotel and flight booking to a travel agent who seemed to have really terrible rates, and because the company had some archaic rules about staying in hotels with a minimum standard, the hotels available tended to be at the fancy end of the spectrum.\n\nI guess it does make it more open and transparent when everything is receipted, but I'm certain that this resulted in vastly higher travel spend, why scrimp by buying a sandwich for dinner if I can buy a steak and charge it to the company? Why bother booking an out of town hotel and getting public transport to work when the travel company will just book me a 5 star downtown hotel.",

        "text": "Posted on behalf of my brother, who doesn't really do social media.\n\nMy brother's company has asked their staff to return to the office for a minimum of 3 days a week. He understands, it makes sense for those in central departments, but he works in an offshore office with three other colleagues, none of whom do the same job (think of it as boss brother, local admin suport, local engineering, local marketing). Since they worked from home they've talked on the phone fewer than 10 times and met in person no more than twice. They work in different departments and don't really need to talk to each other now that everything's online.\n\nThe company are insistent that it's one rule for all, except for the senior manager who decided to move out of their head office and to a different country. She's exempt because she's moved, apparently.\n\nAnyway, the whole ordeal annoyed my brother but, being the good guy he is, he relented as long as his team got the \"return to office\" kit that everybody else got. Namely, headsets, an extra laptop charger, and a locker.\n\nWell, his company decided not to supply lockers. He quoted their \"one rule for all\" back to his senior manager and was told no, Central London is expensive so you must make do with your kit. The new downsized office is what you have, take it or leave it.\n\nThe US staff, following their senior manager's lead, realised that she'd bought a wireless headset because it was easier to transport on her flights back to the country she lived in, so they'd all been given wireless headsets too. Again, he asked for wireless headsets, but was told no, the rule is wired headsets.\n\nMy brother is a very patient man (he has two younger sisters, and we didn't make his childhood easy, so I get this part). He's also someone you never want to piss off because he's very happy to go full send to make a point.\n\nWhilst he's only got a team of 4, including himself, he's the most senior UK employee, totalling about 60 people.\n\nHe agreed to wired headsets if he could request some \"appropriate periphery\" to go along with them. He waited until he got an \"approved\" email from his seniors until he put his plan into action.\n\n60 x wireless headsets were about ¬£47 each.\n\n60 x wired headsets were about ¬£30 each.  \n60 x headset cases were ¬£10 each.  \n60 x Apple lightning to 3.5mm adapters were ¬£8 each (the company phones are iPhones and don't have 3.5mm adapters).  \n60 x large health and safety-compliant backpacks were about ¬£42 each.  \n60 x spare 3.5mm cables were about ¬£2 each.  \n\n\nThe company could have spent ¬£2820 on wireless headsets to keep their offshore staff happy. They ended up spending nearly double that, ¬£5520, and then complained that the wired headsets were too expensive. The newest UK hires are being issued with wireless headsets, and my brother is now looking to return all of the wired headsets and obtain wireless headsets \"for commonality and functional purposes\".\n\nI don't think he'll follow through on that at the moment, but if he gets any more complaints then I'm sure next time I see him for a drink he'll be wearing a wireless headset.  \n\n\nTLDR what's good for the goose is good for the gander.",

        "text": "Back ground. I work in a business building that is next to a very large apartment/condo complex. There has always been signs about towing unauthorized vehicles and owner of building frequently reminded apartment management of this.\nNow the story\nSo after working for a small business in this office building for many years the management/owner restriped the parking lot. This left us with very narrow spaces and in the corner where our office employees have parked for a decade they removed a no parking strip that kept cars from parking at a 90¬∞ angle to each other too closely. Now if I parked in the normal corner my back end blocked my coworker from being able to get out of her space. Also any customers of other offices that parked next to us would door ding us due to too narrow spaces. We are the only business whose employees get to work at 6:30am so we started parking slightly crooked and next to each other to take up a grand total of one extra space and give ourselves space to avoid dings and at the same time the two cars at the 90¬∞ angle corner spots don‚Äôt get blocked in I park the most crooked because I am in that corner and need to allow my coworker to get out.\nEnter Karen‚Ä¶ Karen parks a couple spaces down from me next to a coworker. Is heard mumbling as she goes around to the apartments about how rude some people are in their parking. ( there are many spots open at this time in this off limits parking lot) but that‚Äôs not all. Later while we are all inside and can look out the window to the parking area she comes back to her car for something. This time as she leaves to walk back around the fence to the apartments she stops at my car and writes in the dusty window with her finger ‚Äústupid bitch!‚Äù. Now normally we put a sticker on an unauthorized car parked in our spots so we don‚Äôt have to ruin someone‚Äôs day if they didn‚Äôt notice all the tow away signs. But sister here not only parked where she wasn‚Äôt allowed but then vandalized an authorized car that was parked there to boot not only was it uncalled for but as a professional business, having our clients pull in to see this vulgar message does not lead our clients to feel this is a professional environment. Everyone was ticked off but I am mild mannered and I was livid. \nOkay Karen game just leveled up. I have no legal or other requirement to place a warning sticker before calling for a tow truck. Took 30 minutes and her car was towed. \nA couple hours later she wandered into our office space to ask if we had seen her car. We smiled politely and said oh you must be the lady that wrote those nasty words on our coworkers car! Yah, your unauthorized parking in a private parking lot got your car towed so sorry. And instead of giving her the number and name of the towing company we pointed at the sign with the contact info and sent her out to get it herself. Turns out she was visiting her grand babies at her daughters apartment. Way to go grandma Karen! I think my coworker may have sarcastically mentioned something to her about setting such a good example.",

        "text": "This happened years ago, I was working at a Mcdonald's on a highway rest stop as a teenager over the summer. I was making the burgers in the back when a belligerent customer came up and ordered a cheesburger with EXTRA ONIONS. He made sure to emphasize I WANT EXTRA ONIONS loudly and repeatedly and banging his fist on the counter because last time he ordered EXTRA ONIONS  there wasn't enough onions on it. My manager overheard the order as well because the customer was being loud and rude to the cashier. I looked over at my manager and he gave me the nod, he knew what I had in mind and that he would have my back.\n\nQueue MC: Standard cheeseburgers are supposed to have a little sprinkle of this diced onion mix, I proceed to pile on about a cup of diced onion on top of the burger. To keep it from spilling off the burger I alternated a slice of cheese between 1/2\" thick onion layers, so a total 1-1/2\" thick layer of diced onion and cheese ended up on this burger along with the other toppings. I microwaved it so the melted cheese fused with the onions to keep it all together as best as possible, wrapped it up carefully and put in out for the cashier to pick up. It was as tall as a big mac and weighted 3 times a normal cheeseburger. The cashier picked it up and her eyes grew wide as she hesitantly bagged it, glanced at the manager as he waved her on, and walked back to her register. The customer snapped the bag out her hand and says, \"This better have EXTRA ONIONS on it or i'll be back.\"\n\nWe watch the guy grab his condiments and napkins and head to the seating area so the manager stayed at the counter waiting for any blowback. It wasn't busy so we sent a staff member to go check on the napkin station that was near the guy to see his reaction as he opened up his onion burger.  Sure enough, he unwraps the burger, looks as it inquisitively as onions and cheese spill out the sides, does a little nod and smirk like this was exactly what he was looking for and takes a huge bite out of it, chews a couple times, his eyes then go wide and realizes his mistake and immediately spits it out onto the tray.\n\nHe sits there sheepishly for a few moments with an embarrassed look on his face while he inspects the burger more closely and you can see him ponder his next move while he drinks his soda and munches on fries. He tries scraping off some onion onto the wrapper but the cheese and other toppings are coming with it, basically left with a plain hamburger and bun. He tries unsuccessfully to reassemble the burger with less onion and some of the other toppings, but it was a big pile of onion/ketchup/mustard/cheese with a single pickle. He takes another bite then throws it down on the tray in disgust. He finishes his fries, tosses out the burger in the trash and we watch him leave in embarrassment, he doesn't even glance back to the counter on his way out.",

I absolutely love it because there was a time when sushi gained massive popularity and it seemed sushi buffets were popping up like starbucks. But THIS place wasn't strictly a sushi buffet, they had all sorts of Japanese dishes I couldn't find anywhere else (in addition to the best sushi around). Only place I've been to where I've gotten Japanese food around the same level as the stuff I got in Japan. I don't have the time (or money) to go in as often as I like, but I guess I'm enough of a regular because the owner eventually began to recognize me at a glance.   \n\n\nMy second favorite dish there is a spicy tonkatsu ramen. Now, to clarify, I've grown a solid taste for spicy food, but I'll also freely admit I am not an absolute spicy veteran. \"Ahead of the curve\" maybe (survived the one chip challenge, took The End challenge without puking, etc) but not one of those guys chowing down on raw ghost peppers or ordering a dish with the sole purpose being \"I want to be in PAIN!\"  \n\n\nSo I love this one spicy ramen dish, but after the second time I start thinking \"I think it could actually stand to be a bit more spicy.\" Next time I order it \"extra spicy.\" Bit of an extra kick, was absolutely amazing. So naturally, every other time I order it \"extra spicy.\"   \n\n\nSo they complied. But it seems when I said \"extra spicy\" they took that as \"I want it spicier than last time.\" One day I get a bowl, and it clearly had a whole handful of Thai peppers stewing at the bottom of it.   \nGotta say, it was still delicious as hell, but holy crap that thing was HOT! Part way through eating it I'm sweating and tearing up (natural). A bit further into eating it... I get pins and needles all down my right arm. Had a genuine moment of panic thinking I was having a heart attack until I remembered it would be my left arm to go numb if that was the case.   \nTook a breather, let my system calm down, finished the bowl (it was still delicious after all). Just obviously skipped the extra pile of thai peppers staring at me from the bottom.   \n\n\nNow again, I don't know if this was exactly \"malicious\" compliance. Staff was always friendly, I never put forward a rude \"It wasn't hot enough last time, I said make it SPICIER!\" attitude. It could just be they assumed I meant \"hotter than last time\" every time I said \"extra spicy,\" and acted accordingly. But considering the jump from \"a bit extra spicy\" to \"here have a whole handful of thai peppers,\" it seems like maybe someone in the kitchen first (mistakenly) assumed I meant \"make it hotter than last time,\" AND took it as an arrogant affront to his cooking.   \n\n\nI still go there whenever I can, best food on this hemisphere of the planet imo. Had a laugh with the owner once about the experience, and clarified for the future that my \"extra spicy\" is just me commenting off the base, not challenging them to keep amping it up and up and up until the spice boils my circulatory system.",

Sorry if you've come across it more than once. Please note that the prices mentioned in the story reflect local price of labour when the incident happened. This story did not happen in the UK, though I'm using GBP as stand-in currency. Also, English  isn't my first language. Now, to the story.\n\nMy bro (a cousin) and I rented a place where the front door's knob lock was in bad shape. After some time the lock actually broke down. So, we bought a new knob lock. About 100 yards from our flat, we met a guy who saw the new lock in my hand, introduced himself as a locksmith and asked if we needed lock replacement service. \"Sure, follow us,\"  we said without much thought.\n\nSo the locksmith came with us. At our door, we asked for his price for the job. He demanded 5 pounds. We actually laughed out loud at his price. We weren't certified mechanics at that time, but being from a family of mechanics and engineers, we already had a good enough idea about how much a lock replacement work should be paid in our area. We told the locksmith that we would pay only 50 pence. \n\nI kid you not, the guy said in a very, very polite manner, \"Well, that's too low. Why don't you do it yourself and keep your 50 pence!\". Then he turned and left before we could say anything, muttering about time wasting. We decided to take his parting advice to our hearts. We were strapped for cash, and that was a factor too.\n\nWe  opened the lock box, and the first thing came out of it was a manual.  Bingo! Bro read the manual thoroughly, we and realized that the job was even easier than we initially thought it was.\n\nFive  minutes later, the new lock started it's duty. Alas, the lock serviceman didn't know that, because when he returned 8 minutes later, he couldn't see the shiny new knob lock installed in our door. Maybe the fact that I stood in front of our door blocking the lock from view had something to do with it.\n\n\"Alright!\" He said. \"I'll do it for 50 (pence).\"\n\n\"Do what for 50?\" I asked.\n\n\"The lock. I'll replace it for 50.\"\n\nNow  my bro said, somehow channeling the locksmith's earlier polite manner, \"Sorry but we've already replaced it ourselves.\"  He hauled my ass from the front of the door to show the lock guy our  handiwork.\n\nThe guy just said, \"Oh!\" and left the building. I'm not sure if he heard my bro's muttering about wasting time.\n\nI  actually feel bad about the incident. Maybe that locksmith really needed those 50 pence, or he wouldn't have come back.

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster - another similar post inspired me to contribute one of my malicious compliance stories. \n\nI‚Äôm a paralegal in a large metropolitan city in the U.S. and at the time of the height of the Covid pandemic (2020), I worked for a decently sized boutique personal injury firm. Despite having the largest caseload and the laziest &amp; most toxic attorney in the firm, our boss decided I would be the ‚ÄúCovid Czar‚Äù. Meaning I had to have every employee, higher ups &amp; boss included, fill out a Covid questionnaire every morning when they came in and take their temperature (like have you been exposed, do you have a fever, when was your last test, etc.). \n\nEveryone bitched and moaned with how strict I was enforcing the rules, but for a few months we did well with keeping our office Covid-free. When the holidays were approaching, I advised my boss and the other managing attorneys in a meeting that because everyone was going home to see their families over the holidays, we should have everyone WFH for the first ten days of the new year to prevent a highly potential, and highly probable outbreak. \n\nMy boss smirked and said he didn‚Äôt see a reason to as even if someone was Covid positive, they can just work from home and the rest of the office could still come in. I pointed out that while that would be ideal, if one of the attorneys came in while positive and sat in their office, all the other attorneys including himself would be exposed because all their offices were on the same wall - meaning the air vents in those offices all shared the same airflow. \n\nThe boss shrugged me off, I followed up putting it in an email, and one by one everyone took their days off to visit their families over the holidays. In the new year, less than TWO days back in the office, one of the attorneys (who was young and reckless as we all are when we‚Äôre young) came in sniffling and attempting to not cough. They had a low grade fever, I alerted the managing attorney and texted our boss straining he needed to be sent home immediately. Both told me to just have him stay in his office and announce when he had to leave (bathroom, lunch, copier, etc.) so the staff working in the main area could put their masks on. (The staff always wore their masks regardless because we weren‚Äôt a bunch of idiots and knew the risk they were putting us in but had no choice as there were zero other job opportunities at that time.) \n\nThroughout the day the attorney‚Äôs symptoms are increasingly worse, I text the boss again that he needs to be sent home. Boss finally arrives, looks at the attorney and says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright, right? You don‚Äôt need to go home, it‚Äôs just a cough, right?‚Äù He had been torturing this attorney for months prior so we all knew the attorney‚Äôs response would be ‚Äúof course, it‚Äôs just a sniffle I can work!‚Äù (Sure enough he did.)\n\nThe next day, the attorney reaches out and says his symptoms are worse and his PCR came back positive, so now the boss lets him WFH. The day after that, the attorney in the office next to him messages that he woke up with symptoms and is WFH out of caution. Then another, and another, and eventually all the attorneys who have offices on the same wall with air vents in between them report having symptoms and positive test. By the beginning of the following week, 75% of the office is WFH with symptoms either positive or awaiting PCR results, including myself. \n\nWe had to shut the office down for three weeks because there weren‚Äôt enough people to run the office even on bare bones as everyone got sick pretty much at the same time. When I became sick, my boss wrote in our group chat ‚Äúof course you have symptoms OP, you probably wished for this to happen to just prove a fucking point‚Äù. \n\nWe had been KILLING ourselves for this man and that message was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. A month after everyone returned, the boss was furious and irate that he received several anonymous complaints from the state (we did them gradually to lengthen the process), received several fines, and surprise inspections for months to make sure he was following the rules and in compliance with the pandemic restrictions. We didn‚Äôt get him shut down for good, but after that, every time someone tested positive for Covid he automatically assigned the entire office to WFH for at least 2 weeks with several negative PCR results per employee before they could return to the office.",

        "text": "Few years ago I had recently been promoted.  I was expecting a higher promotion given the fact that I was working at that higher level.  How do I know that I was operating at a higher level?  Because I was covering for the individuals that couldn‚Äôt get through their daily work. These individuals were getting paid $20k more to not do their job.  My manager knew this at the time because I had set up multiple meetings letting them know the work that I was doing.  I was ‚Äúpromised‚Äù a promotion at this higher level by said manager.  To be clear, I wasn‚Äôt expecting $20k more, the new level minimum was only $5k over what I was making. \n\nCue meeting with HR and manager‚Ä¶in which I am told that I was not completing the functions that I said I was completing and I should only be doing the functions within my new ‚Äújob profile‚Äù.  If I was doing any of these functions I should stop.\n\nBackground here, this is financial operations, so we are talking about peoples/clients money. This isn‚Äôt something that you mess around with and making errors or delaying a process could cost a client money that they would then push to my employer. Additionally, this is a huge reputational risk with clients to just not complete a processing function for them and could impact future contracts.\n\nI did exactly as they stated.  I pulled only my clients work.  I processed only the functions that were assigned to me, for the most part.  I still went above and beyond with assisting others within my same level, but not the higher level processing and clients.  I don‚Äôt mean to gloat here, but I was great at this job.  Some of those upper level clients started reaching out directly to me asking why I wasn‚Äôt working on their account anymore and the complaints started rolling in.\n\nI know you all are hoping that the manager came around and promoted me, but you would be wrong.  They eventually ‚Äúrestructured‚Äù the processing so these client would fall within my job profile.  \n\nAs part of the overall restructuring we were to be merged within another team. This manager also assumed that they would be given a promotion.  But due to the overall client satisfaction, senior management decided to hire another individual to that role.   That new manager really knew how to run her teams and has been a great mentor to me ever since then.  My direct manager eventually quit and went to a competitor. I have now had 4 promotions in 5 years and am well above my old managers role.  The company overall is a great place, but it only takes that one crappy person to negatively impact your career.  I think back on that interaction often as that manager leaving the company ultimately sky rocketed my overall career. \n\nHopefully this story inspires other to stand up for themselves.  You might not see the impact immediately, but if you can wait it out your time might come!",

Cue a few years later i move in with them to get out of my mother‚Äôs toxic, co-dependant hold along with the medical benefits of having a regional hospital in my town(i grew up a very ill child for one reason or another). Me and cousins now wife had been best friends for several years now to the point their daughter calls me aunty. I love that role as i cant have my own kids. A story for another time maybe. \n\n So about 7years into living with them, not too many issues aside from the growing pains of learning to live with someone else. We move a mutual friend in to help her out while she divorces her hubby(low income and we had the space) obviously more tension as there‚Äôs more clashing personalities but we all get along mostly. Years of intentional exclusion and bullying from school and family has left me desperate to have anyone that would be willing to hang out with me. Thus causing me to tolerate a LOOOT more shit than i should, this friendship included toward the end. So i had spent about a collective year of her consistently threatening to kick me out over little stuff(bigger things i understood completely) constantly being berated by them and other roomies. Finally about a year and a half ago something inside of snapped and i couldn‚Äôt tolerate it or cope with the 24/7 gaslighting,bullying and silencing of my attempt at standing up for myself and genuinely feeling unwelcome/wanted in my OWN residence So the last few times of the treat to be kicked out in pettiness, i called their bluff and found a different place. A few too many ‚Äúwhy dont you just give your notice and move out.‚Äù And ‚Äúnobody cares about you/your opinion‚Äù i was done. I by no means was perfect either but i was sock of being constantly micromanaged to the point i didnt feel like i was allowed to pee with out announcing it. Or questioned why i breathed a certain way( i am asthmatic and adhd so i breath shallow naturally and sometimes remember this to take a few deep breaths that sometimes sound like a sigh comparatively) i was so stressed out and anxiously awaiting the next moment i got interrogated for something. So when i broke and decided to take up that offer of moving out. While i didnt handle it the best way, i got blasted and degraded for over and hour over text. And longer in person when she barged into my room. about how horrible of a person i am for moving out. How selfish i am for moving out and how they(now former besty that i cut ties to) were ‚Äúsuch a good friend‚Äù and ‚Äúi had it easy there‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never find a place cheaper with everything included‚Äù guess what. I DID find a better place with 1 roomie instead of 4 and im much happier having to pay for my own groceries and i‚Äôve come out of a very dark place in my life as by the time i moved out i was practically a recluse and shut down to a mere shell of my formally bubbly and outgoing self. My mental health took a huge hit because of these behaviours and i was borderline wanting to unalive myself again by the time i left that toxic environment. She was pissed i called her bluff and refused to tolerate their manipulative gaslighting toxic asses. I am far better off after a little over a year of being out of there. Oh and not to mention the amount of times i was accused of being a sl*t/dr*g addicted, attention seeking who**. To which i have never been either. At that time i had been celibate for like 6yrs by choice and never done any elicits before moving out. Never been happier than i am now.",

Hardly cause for alarm. Well this new manager decided aggressively cutting employee hours is the solution. And stupidly to let any customers who come in even until the last possible second. The problem is that getting a new customer set up takes 3-4 hours. Usually we encourage those customers to come back the next day at an earlier time so we aren't open 3-4 hours past close for 1 person. We need a full staff here whenever we are open so serving 1 customer after hours with 10 employees just standing around is a horrible waste of money. \n\nSo that is exactly what we I've been doing. Each new customer that comes in at the last second gets the by the book treatment. So, instead of every employee being done about 30 minutes after we close, we are now staying open hours after we close. Employees are not only getting their hours but overtime in many cases just to serve 1 person at the end of the day. \n\nI would guess we are now spending significantly more on labor costs than we were before our new manager decided to enforce her \"brilliant\" ideas against everyone's objections. But hey, all this extra money I now getting from overtime is great.",

I was working overnight which meant I never really saw a manager and had to do everything on my own, literally I would be the only one in the office.

And there were two of them doing about two thirds of the work I was doing alone. So I did what anyone would do and asked if I could get a pay bump to match my new colleagues, only to be told no. So instead I went and looked closely at my contract. Which stated I was only paid for 11 hours a night, with the expectation of an unpaid hour for the overnight approximation of lunch. \nBut you see dear reader, I had been working for a full 12 hours, because I had no one to cover me, and technically I still didn't because different contracts and areas of operation. So I looked up the overtime policy, and the forms. I printed off a stack and filled them in to cover my entire shift pattern, and claim for my hours lunch that I couldn't take.\nThen I made sure they were submitted every week to get my extra pay. Eventually they gave me my raise but I carried on claiming until they hired someone to work with me and I couldn't claim anymore. But the damage was done and the crappy manager that couldn't understand why I wanted equal pay for an equal job \"moved on\".\nIt still makes me smile to think how much money I must have cost them for trying to screw me over.",

She forced us to work evenings by sending us Outlook invitations to \"book our evenings\" without asking us if it was convenient or paying us overtime, she was always making nasty comments about everyone and she was always telling us that we were not grateful to her. \n\nIn short, at one point we went to report the situation to human resources. The girl from human resources told us that we shouldn't expect the situation to change just for us, that the company maybe was not made for us. \nWe were very angry with this indifferent answer from this girl from human resources who left at 4pm every night, so we expressed to the VP of finance directly that he was going to lose a part of his finance team. The VP of Finance had the HR girl come into his office and tell her to pay us thousands of dollars in bonuses in order to prevent us from leaving. She was furious! I left within a year but she never looked me in the eye again!",

        "text": "Inspired by a recent post. On mobile, etc.\n\n\nHad a friend that liked hot food and we would go out to Chinese restaurants almost every Sunday after church (they were the only ones open on Sundays in Tonga). We would always go out and got basically the same type of food (orange or lemon chicken, and kung pao beef or borccoli beef, etc) Since we always had the same food, we would go to different restaurants so at least there was a little more variety in the available dishes, and in case on restaurant was closed or busy etc. \n\nIt's important to note that I LIKE spicy food. Spices are the spice of life, and hot is good. But I also have some issues that mean I can only handle a certain level of spice without it bothering me, and I don't like pain, so eating something that makes me cry and my hose run isn't something I enjoy anyway. My friend has no such problems, and to my knowledge, had not (at least to that point) reached a max spicy level. \n\nSo we had gone to this one restaurant the week before, and really liked it, so the next week we went back. Now, as we're ordering rhe same stuff we always seem to get, I say I want the spicy beef. My friend chimes in and says \"but make it hot. Last time, I could barely tell there was even a pepper involved.\" (This was like 8 years ago, so I forget the exact words, but basically told the waitress to tell the chef he didn't know how to make food, and he was a wimp for not using more peppers LOL). \n\nMC: when the waitress comes out with the food, she has all the normal food that's edible. And then she brings a pile of spicy beef that is COVERED with peppers. And I mean the little tiny red peppers that will lay out normal person if they ate 25% of one. There were like 30 or 40 of those on the late, and there was no mistaking that they were there and that they were influencing the heat of the dish LOL.\n\nI was actually able to eat around the peppers, but my friend seemed to enjoy them, though as I recall, he did leave quite a few on the plate!",

        "text": " \n\nAfter  undergrad, I moved to Texas to manage with a mostly local chain of  Tex-Mex restaurants.  At one of my first training stores, I was assigned  a month in the kitchen to learn their BOH (back of house, i.e., the  kitchen) process.  As I grew up in the business and had worked during  college for a large casual dining chain, I was familiar and skilled in all  of the general aspects of running this type of kitchen.  However, it  was a good opportunity to learn the particular aspects of this company's  operations.\n\nAfter driving from  north-east Dallas to Grapevine early one morning I greeted the driver,  retrieved my clipboard and started supervising the unload.  He worked  fast and had the truck unloaded in about 30 minutes or so.  I knew I had  a good 60-90 minutes left organizing (date dotting, rotating , breaking  down boxes, etc), and was happy to sign him off so he cold get on his  way while I continued putting away the order.  For reference, this is  how I had always done this and never had any problem.\n\nAs  I am working through the delivery, I notice we are short one case of  20ct shrimp.  Obviously, that's quite a bit of money.  But those types  of things happen and in my experience, the process was to call the  vendor promptly and let them know.  Most times, they would contact the  driver, he'd find it on the truck and bring it later or they would  credit our order.\n\nBut not this  time.  This time, the vendor tells me that they have a strict policy  about this and since I'd signed the order, they didn't feel obligated to  credit us.  I told them that seemed like a bad policy when dealing with  a restaurant that was doing around $70,000 a week in sales (this is 1995) and and paid promptly.  They didn't seem to care.\n\nSo  next week, I again meet the driver on delivery day.  Everything was  going pretty much the same, except this week, when he handed me the  delivery form to sign, I informed him that since we were short last week  and his company didn't want to work with us, I wasn't signing anything  until I had \\*everything\\* counted and I couldn't count everything, until I  worked through the large pile.\n\nSince  he couldn't leave without getting a signature, he got to stand on our  back dock until I was done.  I may have been a bit extra thorough  counting and organizing that day, because he was \\*fuming\\* when I got  back to him about 1.5 hours later with a signed form.\n\nI  assume that his made him late enough to miss several deliveries that  day as many restaurants won't accept delivery between 10 and 2pm.  But I  know he was late to several stops because his company called me the  next day and said that they couldn't work this way.  They quickly agreed  that if we cooperated and acted in good faith on future orders, they  would return the favor.  We received credit for the missing shrimp on  our next delivery.",

One of the guys negotiated with hotels; free breakfast, evening meals and drinks included but not on the invoice. This meant we always topped the maximum ¬£100 per night he allocated for hotels. On his previous account he paid ¬£60-70 per night. This also meant it freed up our ¬£25 tax free evening meal money. If breakfast was included on the invoice he would deduct from the ¬£25.\n\nTo keep everyone happy the higher paid ones paid for the lower paid ones with an air miles reward credit card, they also setup reward accounts with the hotels. It was great, we were all planning free holidays with the hotel rewards/air miles and we were ¬£125 per week better off.\n\nUnfortunately the boss realised how badly his plan panned out and he reverted back to paying for the hotels himself within 6 weeks.",

        "text": "This happened to me a while ago, in 2020 at the height of covid.\n\nI (F26 at the time) was working as a department manager at one of my local big box stores. Just before Thanksgiving I started to get sick. The way our system worked we were supposed to do a check-in to prove that we didn't have symptoms of covid. One of us managers would normally fill in the form when you got to work. And if you were management someone else had to do it for you. \n\nSome of the basic questions:\n\n- do you have xyz symptoms of covid\n- have you been around anyone with covid\n- have you taken a covid test in the last 3 days.\n\nAt this time I started to get sick I told my manager what symptoms I was having. On top of that I had just been around two people who had come down with covid and I had been out of state two weeks prior. She marked off that I didn't have any symptoms of covid. She insisted that we all work through the holiday or get written up. So I ended up working through the holiday because I really needed my job. Looking back I know that wasn't the smartest thing to do considering we were at the height of a global pandemic but I really couldn't afford to not be working and to have my boss make working even harder. She was known lovingly by the employees as Satan incarnate.\n\nBecause of that I started getting more sick. Customers were allowed in our store without masks as long as they said \"I have a medical reason\". I informed my boss and I'm immuno compromised and I have asthma before I even started because I knew it was likely that I would get sick if customers were coming in without masks. I wore a mask all the time but I knew that wasn't enough.\n\nAfter the holiday I took a couple days off because I was sick. My boss didn't like it but she appreciated the fact that I worked through the holiday regardless. I have been coughing and sneezing at work and trying to avoid getting people sick, so it was pretty well known by the employees that I wasn't doing well. During that time I took a lot of medicine and was trying to get better. \n\nBut I started getting texts from another manager saying something along the lines of 'it must be nice to be on vacation. You're not really sick, you're just relaxing and having a great time huh?' That really hurt, I hadn't gotten a covid test so that way I could come back to work as quickly as possible and help relieve any backlog that my absence had caused.\n\nCue the malicious compliance.\n\nWhen I read that I decided instead of going back to work feeling while still sickish I was going to go back when I was fully okay. So I went and got a covid test. At that time covid test weren't rapid and they took about a week to process. I called my manager and told her I had to get a covid test because I had so many symptoms and they weren't going away. Legally she could not force me back to work, and the company had to be notified that someone in the store might have covid that way if anyone else got sick they could keep track. Turns out there were a couple of employees who had covid and had been coming to work and their forms were not being filled out properly. And because I forced the issue they were also able to force the issue too and got their covid test and paid for their missed work.",

        "text": "An old Facebook memory popped up on my feed recently and reminded me of this. English is my primary language, so any mistakes are from my own sheer incompetence. Trust me when I say it would be even worse in one of the other languages I \"speak.\"\n\nYears ago I worked for a big box office supply retailer in Canada. During my last three or so years there, I was member of what they called the Project Team. The purpose of this team was to travel the country and work on the physical appearance of different locations. One project might be a week-long $500k \"minor\" renovation to modernize the looks, physically move one or two aisles around, and rework some of the planograms. The next project might be a multi-million dollar new build that would take many weeks and would involve taking over operations once our construction contractors were nearing completion and we were expecting a couple dozen fully loaded trailers of merchandise to arrive. Occasionally, though far less often than one would think, we would come in to a store that was being shut down and help facilitate the movement of product to other locations before turning the lights off for good.\n\nThis particular project was one of my first major ones since joining the team, so I wasn't terribly familiar with timelines and how long things should take, but this one was a relocation job. We were shutting down one store and reopening it in an old Chapters building a few blocks away. The time given was three weeks (I believe, though might have been four... It's been a decade since this happened) to open the new location, and the closure would take an additional week. We also had a brand new hire working as our Project Coordinator, though the two directly below him were experienced members and would help smooth out any wrinkles, but the PC had ultimate say on how things would proceed. Hard opening was scheduled for Day Zero and Home Office had hired a local radio station to host a couple of their morning DJs there, had set up a traditional Chinese celebration including dragon dancers, and a couple local politicians were to cut the ribbon. So we couldn't easily reschedule should any major issues arise.\n\nFirst couple weeks went smoothly. We brought on two dozen temp workers to help put the shelving units together and start setting up product and planograms. I was put in charge of receiving the seemingly endless train of trucks dropping off new product and ensuring there were no discrepancies. A few small hiccups occurred but nothing that couldn't be quickly solved with a polite, yet firm phone call to the offending freight company's dispatch team to run traces on missing pallets and to hotshot them here asap once found. \n\nBy now we were starting the third week of six ten hour shifts and we discovered things were starting to slowly fall apart during our Monday morning scrum. We had finished installing the networking gear and set up the store computers and POS systems, but nothing would connect or talk to one another. This meant none of the product we had received could be properly put into the system to show on-hands. Registers wouldn't talk to anything, so even if we could show stock, we wouldn't be able to charge any customers. Even the internal network that would allow the copy center to print to different printers wouldn't work. Then we realized we were starting to fall behind on getting planograms set up, there was a furniture pad that had yet to see a single desk or chair constructed, and a million tiny tasks had yet to be addressed. It basically amounted to two week's worth of work needing to be done in one. We warned Home Office but couldn't get an extension on the opening. It had to open by the end of that week, no excuse.\n\nOkay then. \n\nTen hour shifts turned in twelve, which quickly turned to fourteen hour shifts. The hotel staff were fantastic and took pity on us, allowing special outside hours access to the rooftop hot tub as we usually didn't get back until after it normally closed and we needed nothing more than a hot soak and cold beer at the end of each day. \n\nThe final day of prep rolled around and we're still at least a day behind. That morning at seven we load up on Starbucks and Red Bull, and warn our temps that it will be a long day. We tell them that if they'd like to stay, it's guaranteed double time pay for whatever extra time they put in, but no hurt feelings if they just want to bug out at the normal time. Five rolls around and the majority of the temps take off, leaving just six behind. A couple more leave after two or three hours as they have other obligations. We're now down to four temps and our core internal team of six. Midnight decides to arrive and our network finally goes online. Mad dash to finalize all that. Two in the morning makes a shy appearance, only to find all of us passed out on chairs for a quick nap. Mind you, we're still all punched into work since seven that morning. Short nap finishes and we make a mad dash to at least give an appearance of a finished project. A few hours later around seven we start seeing regional and district managers showing up, along with the staff that will work at this location. We're basically delerious from a lack of proper sleep, yet we're not done. Next up is to put on our manager uniforms and help with the grand opening, just in case something pops up that needs our help. Ten in the morning finally arrives and our PC tells us to go home, and that he'll explain to Payroll why we just pulled a twenty seven hour shift. \n\nUnderstandably it took a bit of convincing from our leadership team to actually prove that our punch times were correct and even more finagling to override the payroll systems to ensure we were properly paid as whoever had programmed the software had never considered any sane person would work that long in a single shift.\n\nNeedless to say my next big project with a similar scale was miraculously expanded to run for six weeks instead. \n\nIt was a nice paycheque, though. \n\n\n\nTL;DR - Company allocated too short of a time to complete a project, resulting in far higher labour costs than expected.",

They were training me for another promotion when my boss goes through every time I‚Äôve ever been even a minute late back from breaks or lunches. Keep in mind in the last 6 months I had only ever been out sick twice which even though I had sick pay were each considered a strike.  Even when I got COVID from being exposed at work, the 2 days I called out were each separate occurrences held against me on my review and bonus.\n\nEffectively it was 5-10 minutes all in one minute increments and those 10 minutes were enough for him to write me up and say I will still be training for the promotion but there is no way in my review in a month I will receive the promotion or pay increase till next review. He even said I was an example employee, excelling in this role and I can handle more then anyone without being challenged. So because of these few minutes I will have to do the job for this promotion for a year without pay or title and I‚Äôm on write up. I asked him to clarify if that meant each time I was a minute late was as much as a strike as being out sick for the day and he said yes, it‚Äôs based on occurrences. \n\nWell one day I was having car issues, and if I were to work from home that day I‚Äôd only be a minute or two late, he also reprimands having to work from home too much since we‚Äôre supposed to be in office 4 times a week. If I came in office I‚Äôd be at least 20 minutes late. So I decided to call out sick since it‚Äôs all the same anyways. \n\nHe also ended up promoting me anyways, after telling me this wasn‚Äôt possible no matter how perfect my attendance was. So I found a new job and left, giving me an even bigger raise.",

        "text": "I was working at this multinacional software consultancy firm a few years back when this happened.\n\nA few of us got a Skype notification from our manager to check our email ASAP. It was one of his higher ups, with my manager in CC, asking us why we had some specific MS program installed, who gave us the license and authorisation to install it, and if we didn't have authorisation we should remove it and read our guidelines. He was a huge unprofessional dick about it. \n\nI checked and did have it installed even though I didn't install anything on that machine. Replied as such and said I had already removed it. Didn't really enjoy having to go through shit when I wasn't in the wrong and told my manager as such. He just said I knew not to do it which really pissed me off some more.\n\nCome next week everyone gets the same treatment. Turns out we were all given the same software packaged when they imaged our laptops. Management became very quiet when we raised that flag but did make sure to ask us to remove it.\n\nThis is were MC comes in. I was working on a project and we were asked at the end of one day to provide a video demo. We couldn't record using phone cameras so I declined and told them how to run our work so they could see it running for themselves. I then left and ignored all calls from work which were many. Went to the gym, had a nice meal, ignored all texts. Fun times. \n\nCome next morning I had several emails asking for our team to just use some software and get it done. That's just what I wanted. I asked, in writing, if they would provide the software and was told to just download anything and do it already as the appropriate department would take two weeks to analyse our needs and they needed that demo yesterday. They couldn't provide us with appropriate software either as they had no idea what would work and it wasn't their business. \n\nThe thing is, we weren't even allowed to download freeware acording to our guidelines. So I quoted page and section, reminded them I had a previous written warning and order, as well as my entire office, and would refuse on that basis. I would be happy to run the whole thing on my personal machine with my own software but reminded them that was also against the rules.\n\nNeedless to say I had an interesting chat with my own manager and was eventually excused to just download anything and record the demo.\n\nI made sure to send the video along with information I had been explicitly told by my higher up to comply, who I CC'd, and put in the software's name and download website so I could cover my ass.\n\nThat rule was relaxed very soon after.\n\nFunny thing was, whenever our laptops needed to be re-imaged they would still come with the offending program, we were just never bothered about it.",

        "text": "This happened in the UK, about 12 years ago when I worked as a Customer Assistant in a large well-known retail store.\n\nIt's nothing big but at that time, I thought 'ok, if that's how it is then that's how i'll play it too'.\n\nI'd been working for the company for 3 years and had not taken a single day off for sickness since I'd started working there. If I was feeling a little under the weather, I'd just go in and work through it whilst taking any medication, if required.\n\nHere's where it takes place. \n\nI'd been playing football with friends on a weekend when i got tackled and felt a shooting pain in my knee. Instant excruciating pain. I went to the hospital and got an X-Ray but nothing of concern was visible as there were no broken bones. I recieved pain killers and was referred for an MRI as I was still in pain. MRI results showed that I've got a partial tear to the ACL and would need time to recover. \n\nInitially, I'd notified my manager that I'd been injured and would not be coming in to work. After a week of absence, I provided a Doctors Note (as required) which signed me off from work for 3 more weeks.\n\nA month after the injury took place, I was able to hobble around and was going stir-crazy at home. My colleagues were keeping me updated on what was happening at work. I was aware that my manager was getting heat from senior managers for a member of the team having an extended absence. So, I decided to go back in to work. First day back, I am informed that there will be a meeting for my absence. I attend the meeting with a Union Rep and go over the absence and the reason for it. I explained everything that happened but it seemed like my manager was not actually listening. She was just giving me a chance to have my say but she already knew the decision she was making..\n\nThe manager then takes some 'time out' to make an informed decision on the outcome of this meeting. She comes back and tells me that because I have reached the trigger point for absences, she will have to give me a written warning. That simple.\n\nI felt betrayed and appalled at how I was being treated after all I've put in to the company. I also found out that the Union Rep I had reached to support me was intentionally being unhelpful because she was friends with my manager.\n\nCue malicious compliance...\n\nI had 7 days to make an appeal against the decision so I started looking in to the company's Attendance Policy.\nThe first thing I noticed was that the trigger point is to trigger a meeting to review absences and not to hand out written warnings like the manager had stated in the meeting.I also realised that employees cannot receive a formal warning for their first absence. It must be an informal verbal warning first because the manager has to personally tell you about the attendance policy at that initial meeting and keep a record of it in order to escalate.\n\nThen I went through the rest of the policy and found a loop hole which meant I could take 3 days off sick every 3 months without triggering an Attendance meeting.\n\nI made my appeal and the initial decision was overturned. So, no written warning on record.\nThen every 3 month I would take 3 sick days off. This ended up giving me 12 extra holiday days per year.\n\nThe result: \nThey could have just let me have that 1 month absence and return to work as normal but instead I am absent for 12 extra days a year because the company doesn't give a shit about employees",

        "text": "Saw a post a few weeks or so back that unlocked this particular MC memory for me...\n\nApologies for the long read, but I really wanted to make sure I properly captured the haughtiness of the customer in this story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 30 or so years ago, I dropped out of high school. My first job was as a truck jockey for a bloke who owned his own removal truck, and had a delivery contract with a local chain of furniture stores. The work was hard, and days were usually pretty long (I have an old payslip somewhere for an 84 hour week), but I was young, fit and healthy, and the work saved me from needing a gym membership. Plus the cash was really good for a 16yo kid.\n\nOne long, reasonably warm Saturday, we're heading to our last delivery before going home. It was close to 6pm, and we'd still have a \\~45-60min drive home after, so the boss was in no mood for fucking around. The delivery was in Melbourne's (at the time - probably still is) wealthiest suburb: Toorak. Lots of big houses and old money.\n\nAnyway, we rock up at this place and the boss heaves a sigh of relief: massive double entry doors at the front. We were delivering a 3-seater sofa bed. Fucking things were heavy, with the metal fold-out bed inside, so anything that made the delivery that little bit easier was seen as a positive. As usual, the hops into the back of the truck and starts unwrapping the load to get it onto the tailgate, while I go knock on the door, clipboard in hand.\n\nI ring the bell (old fashioned turn the brass handle thing) and a butler(?) opens the door. I see just over his shoulder a massive entry hall, with big, wide staircase leading up to the second storey. Awesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Him: \"Yes?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"G'day - we're here to deliver a sofa bed for\" \\**checks clipboard*\\* \"Mrs Richbitch\" (name changed to protect the rich bitch, and coz I can't remember/don't care)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him (*gesturing around to the right of the house*): \"Delivery entrance is around the side.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"Oh, OK.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI trot around to the side door, thinking it would be a straight up delivery into a room nearer to that door. I wait, and he (eventually) opens the door. Per our SOP, I ask him to show me where the furniture was going, so I could map the route out for the boss. He gestures to (I'm genuinely not. Fucking. Kidding.) a goddamm spiral fucking staircase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Me: \"Up those stairs?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: \"Yes\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"But I noticed there's a lot more room at the front doors, plus the bigger staircase there. Can we deliver via that route instead?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: \"The lady of the house wishes for it to be delivered via the rear staircase.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"Really? There's no way we're getting that sofa bed up there without hurting ourselves, or the furniture or house. Why can't we deliver via the front?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: \"The lady of the house simply will not permit it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"Oooookaaaaay. I'll go let my boss know.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time I get back to the truck, the boss has the sofa sitting on the tailgate, ready for us to carry it in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Boss: \"Ready?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"Not quite. You're not gonna believe it, but they want us to deliver via a side entrance and up a spiral staircase.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: \"The fuck they do!\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \"Yep - old mate in the suit and tie said so.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: \"How many times did you ask him?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (unsure why): \"A couple - wasn't sure I heard him right the first time, but he said the customer won't allow it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Him: \"Nah - bullshit. Wait here.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe boss strides up to the front door and rings the bell, perhaps a little aggressively. Butler opens it, words are exchanged, the boss gets pretty heated and demands to see the customer - Mrs Richbitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;RB: \"What's all this nonsense?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boss: \"Your fella here said we can't deliver through these doors and up that staircase behind you. The other way is too narrow - we'll bust our backs trying to get it up there!\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RB: \"That's not my concern. My desire is for the furniture to be delivered via the side entrance.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boss: \"Nah - we're not doing that. Just let us go this way and we'll be out of your hair in no time.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RB: \"I insist that you deliver the furniture in accordance with the terms of the contract.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*CUE M.C.\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe boss straightens up, squares his shoulders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Ok. Sure. No worries. We'll get it done, as you said, in accordance with the delivery contract.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe walks back towards me, massive fucking grin on his face, and tells me to grab the highlighter (fluorescent marker) from the cab. I go grab it and hand it to him. He highlights something on the delivery docket on the clipboard, tosses it onto the sofa, and gestures at me to grab my end. I'm wondering what the fuck is about to go down, but I know my boss well enough to know we aren't about to carry this bloody thing through a side door and up a spiral staircase.\n\nAs we get near the front doors, the boss tells me we're putting the sofa bed down. He grabs the clipboard and politely asks RB to sign for delivery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;RB: \"I'm not signing anything yet - you haven't delivered it to where I want it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boss: \"Ah, but we have now. Please read the section I've highlighted.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RM (*reading said bit*): \"Oh, well that changes things. Through the front doors will be fine.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boss: \"Sorry - please read the second highlighted section.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RB (*reading second said bit*): \"But I've changed my mind.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boss: \"Sorry - as you can see, it says that deliveries must be made the safest way possible *without risking injury to us* and if we still disagree *after three attempts* at making delivery, the *customer takes responsibility* for completing the delivery from the front of the premises. We asked four times so, as you requested, I'm delivering per the terms of the delivery contract you signed.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RB (*going red*): \"But how am I supposed to get this upstairs?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boss: \"I'm afraid that's no longer my problem ma'am. Please sign the delivery docket so we can get out of your hair.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took that as my cue to fuck off, pack up the wraps and straps, and prep the truck for departure. We managed to hold in our laughter until the end of the driveway.",

        "text": "I am not sure if I shared this before I don't think so so here it goes. \n\nThis from when I worked for my former employer as personal auto claims adjuster. After 2020 we had a staffing shortage and it was very hard to be able to return calls (like literally i was on the phone and would have three voicemails when I got off, and it would continue). My company announced they were going to start allowing us to enroll customers in text message communication; in fact they were going to encourage it as they wanted to move towards a more digital option to streamline things (like many customers). \n\nI was thrilled. With all my first time calling on my new claims I would sign people up. It was great! I responded to peoples texts when they had questions and would send them follow up texts through the claim asking if they had any questions how the repairs went, etc. I loved it! My customers loved it! I got good surveys! \n\nThe month after our first month doing this we have a regionwide townhall meeting and I had the most outbound text messages in that month by over 200 (I think my total was like 280 and the next person after me was 30) from the next person. I got a gift card and recognition by the regional manager at an office wide town hall. My team got lauded as well since now our team was the one using the new text message system the most (since I was using more than any one else). I was happy! My boss was happy! My team was happy! My customers were happy! The regional manager was happy because it was making our region look good! The other managers were happy! Everyone was happy, happy, happy! You get it.\n\nNow simple logic would say that since I was using texting to follow up each one of thoses messages could have been a phone call but instead was a text. Right?\n\nWell the higher ups over my regional manager (the same ones who allegedly pointed to my text messaging numbers and were thrilled the new method was working) didn't think so.\n\nMy boss called me aside to discuss my numbers and told me he had some concerns about how I had the least number of outbound calls the prior month, same mount I had all of the text messages. He showed me my numbers and where I ranked. Now, I wasn't the lowest in the region mind you nor even the lowest on the team but I was below the peer average.  It was clear that number was not taking into consideration the number of outbound texts I had done. \n\nI agreed it was low but pointed out if you added that number of out bound calls for each performer to each performers number of outbound texts my number of those combined would be higher than anyone else.   \n\n\nHe said he agreed but that the higher ups wanted a reason for why I was not making as many outbound calls. \n\nI thought this was a joke question at first and when I realized he wasn't joking I said, \"Because instead of making outbound calls, I am texting customers which is is what the customers signed up for (Note: we can't text a customer who doesn't sign up for it). So logic should say that for each of my text messages that should be one less outbound call that I would be making.\"\n\nMy boss said once again he understood but this had gone to the higher ups over my regional manager and they wanted me to be making more outbound calls.\n\nSo I realized this whole, texting people more didn't mean they expected us to making fewer outbound calls and essentially have the same workload, they were looking for us to make the same number of outbound calls on top of texting people, essentially increasing our workload. \n\nI told him, I would focus on making sure I had more outbound calls on the next report.\n\nNow here is the thing about our phones and how they worked with measuring metrics: they can see how many calls we have coming in, how many calls we make going out, how many calls we answer, and the average length of each call. \n\nBut the report for the metrics doesn't show what numbers we are dialing....\n\nSo each time I sent a text message I would first call my cell phone when my voicemail picked up I would type the response the customer in our text message application and once I had finished typing and hit sent. I would then hang up the phone.   \n\n\nThis ensured two things: I was making an outbound call and the length would still fall into the average length for each call.\n\nNext month my boss pulled me aside to congratulate me on a job well done with improving my outbound calls while still maintaining my high text messages. \n\nOf course when my annual performance review came around they still used that low outbound call month as an excuse not to promote me and only offer me a pathetic 3% raise so that was the final straw in a long list of reasons as to why I moved onto a different company). (Note: I kept in touch with several coworkers a few of whom still work there and what from what they have told me it has just gotten worse and a lot of high turnover so I made the right choice.",
