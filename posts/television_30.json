        "text": "Hey.\n\nHope you’re doing well.\n\nOf course, “jerks” is a broad label and most iconic characters are far more complex, but I hope you get the point I’m trying to make. \n\nIs it primarily because it makes them more complex and interesting if they aren’t always just goody two shoes, because then everyone should love them and there is no fascination if there aren’t more layers you can peel off the character because they’re so perfect and inspirational? Of course, you can be a jerk sometimes but still a good person at heart, but there are also people who are pretty much complete angels in real life who would never hurt anyone and really likable (example of a famous person is Brendan Fraser).\n\nThere are certainly characters who fit the goody two shoes archetype but it feels like it is far more common for characters to be either flawed with elements of their behavior leading them to hurting others but deep down they’re good people (Parks and Rec or everyone besides Cam in Modern Family, for instance) or just straight up buttholes, like, all the time (IASIP being an example of this). \n\nGreg House is a complete cranky, misanthropic jerk but there are also a lot of layers to him to peel back and that’s the premise of the show.\n\nWould you be interested in more shows (yes, they exist, but not as ubiquitous as shows with flawed/jerk central characters) where either the lead or even all the protagonists are wholesome model citizens who could be role models even if they screw up and inadvertently and occasionally hurt others but show tremendous remorse? Or would that be boring because we need screw ups and drama and the world is not black and white speeches from characters hurting others?",

        "text": "I loved this show from the start up until the end of episode 7. But that ending really underwhelmed and perplexed me. Were they expecting a season 2 or something? Because they left so many questions they themselves asked unanswered. Here's a few:\n\n1) In the episode where Jane has the flashback of her dad drugging her drink as we go back to the present we hear a voice saying \"I told you. I always win\" or something along those lines indicating he did manage to get her child killed. At one point I thought that a twist would be that Andy is not her daughter, but no apparently that meant something else we just never learn what.\n\n2) Nick's  motives are also a mystery. At some point we learn that he took someone else's identity, and in a later scene Jane accuses him of doing everything to get revenge from her father. But we never learn who he was, his connection to the real Nick or why he hated the quelers so much. \n\n3) What was that end with Jasper blackmailing Jane? What could he possibly want from her? And why did they structure that scene as a cliffhanger and put it right before the final one written like a happy ending?\n\n4) The snow. In the first episode when Jane gets hit in the diner she starts hallucinating and says \"it's cold, is it snowing? he's coming back\". This scene is played as a flashback many times in follow up episodes. The clear implication was that Nick tried to get to them at some point. But that never happened. \n\n5) The big one. What happened to Jane's mother? There was perfect set up there to do a twist where her father killed her and that's her motive for arranging his death, but after that one scene of her trying to leave and an off hand mention we never hear about the mother at all. \n\nIs any of this in the book? What a bad ending.",

I missed the real-time airing of the final season, and I do not want to buy the episodes, so I am waiting for it to stream on Netflix. Is anyone else in the same boat?\n\nIf so, what are your thoughts on season 1-5? Please no spoilers for season 6!\n\nAfter my binge, I came to think of the show as not about Jimmy become Saul, but about a love story between Jimmy and Kim. It's not necessarily a healthy love story, but it's a love story nonetheless. Interestingly, while Jimmy just seems to be in love with Kim in the convention way of romantic love, I'm not sure I am convinced that Kim's feelings are one of love more so than one of protectiveness. I think Kim loves Jimmy, but what drives her is this idea that Jimmy is an underdog that she needs to protect/support; for her, it's Kim and Jimmy against the world. That's why she doesn't leave him and only digs in deeper into her relationship when someone/something threatens it or doubts it.  \n\nKim's evolution (devolution?) was surprising and at times disappointing, but always masterfully executed. I admire that, time and time again, the show was able to make us feel that at any moment Saul would cross a line and Kim would be out of there only for Kim to double down on her loyalty to Jimmy.  It's as though we, as an audience, never learn. And I kind of love that the show does that to us.",

        "text": "Hello! I’ve been trying to find a group online that understands the frustration of another canceled show that wasn’t given a chance. I figured a group for tv would get it? \n\nThe first hit that really got to me was Anne With an E. A beloved childhood series turned tv with a brilliant and oh so accurate man lead, canceled 3 seasons on.\n\nThen Shadowhunters was canceled as soon as I started the show (lol, what bad luck), but alas I was hooked.  \n\nThennnnnnn, I started First Kill, while more CW-esque in quality, I still had a lot of fun watching it. Before I knew it, it was also canceled.\n\nAt this point, I’m pretty jaded when an adaption of another favorite book of my teenage years is announced. During my teenager years in 2014, a movie had already been made that pretty much bombed and tonally didn’t match whatsoever. Despite this and my torn feelings, I pushed hard for a second movie online as I was 17ish and really just wanted to see these characters on screen. \n\n\n Anyway, even knowing all of this, I’m ultimately still weak over vamp media so I watched it. \n\n\nAnd it was so amazing! My worries were finally over, the show was getting mostly positive attention, and eery article I came across predicted it’s renewal. My broken heart was healed! \n\n\nAdditionally, (at this point, more on that later) the show had an 82% for user ratings and 75% for critics (which would go up to the current 77%) on rotten tomatoes. Important tidbit, Peacock displays the user Rotten Tomato score on their service.\n\nRewind back to right before the cancellation when, on the day of the finale, the user ratings suddenly got hundreds upon hundreds of random 1 star scores. This plummeting the ratings down to eventually the 45% it has currently (with 3000+ ratings).\n\nAnother detail that feels important; Bumper in Berlin was renewed for a season 2 when it was at a 50% of critic score and only 13 total user scores. \n\nPost the finale, there was a period from October to early January where no news was mentioned. Despite this, the show even trended with the tag #RenewVampireAcademy as the lack of news made fans antsy.  Then Bumper was renewed and another week went by with no VA news. \n\n\nUntil suddenly, Vampire Academy is then canceled. The lack of promotion before and during running probably didn’t exactly help the show gather a huge huge audience, but it was a one season show on a newer streamer. It needed time to show as is common (just think of if Buffy had been canceled at this point in it’s run!) VA did already have a dedicated fanbase, which you think would make a good choice to renew as the people who were finding it were becoming passionate about it. \n\n\nIt wasn’t until Peacock Executives started talking on the subject that I started getting actually bitter. Vampire Academy was specifically aged up to TV-MA with the intention of allowing the fans that aged with it to feel it was still for them. Yet, every interview about the cancellation chalked it up to being a “teen show”. \n\n\nSo there’s my rant. An amazing show with fun potential to become a huge hit with its intended crowd+ was cut short with many excuses and what (in my opinion) feels like bad choices. \n\n\nOn the hopes of helping it get more fans, I’d love to also talk about the show. As with the books, best friends Rose Hathaway and Lissa Dragomir come from the political world of the Dominion, where Moroi (fully vampires with elemental powers) are protected by their Guardian Dhampirs (half vampires with enhanced strength and no sensitivity to the sun) from Strigori (the evil undead traditional vampires).\n\nLissa is a Moroi princess and Rose is a novice Dhampir who share an unusual bond in a world where Dhampirs are treated as inferior. \n\n\nIf you would like to watch the show, it’s on Peacock in the US, Stan in Australia, and essentially tons of non-USA streaming sites that all aired it originally at a different time which probably didn’t do a lot with making the show easier to watch. You can use [this wonderful Collider article](https://collider.com/vampire-academy-series-streaming/) for assistance in finding additional legal places to watch the show.\n\nIf you’d like to sign the petition after this, or just toss me a pity signature out of mutual support in this cancellation boom, you can find it by searching renew vampire academy for a season 2. Is really appreciate it as I’m unfortunately pretty hyper focused on this.\n\nYou can also find the instagram page I help run [here](https://instagram.com/save_va_?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=).",

Maybe there were shows like Friends who also did it well. It conveyed emotion which the actors and script couldn’t. \n\nIt became the goto for shows for a long time to end episodes with a montage while playing some emotionally intense song. House was notorious for doing this. \n\nThe pinnacle like most things seems to be when it gets a good satire. Rick and Morty used Damage Coda in great satire of the “good turns bad” trope\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4Js-XbNj6Tk\n\nI am guessing it’s a factor of costs and the new media model of streaming services. It’s both derivative and expensive to nurse an emotional, recognized song for a moment. But I’m sure it still happens\n  \n\nSo what are some recent emotional song moments like the 2000-20teens shows?",
