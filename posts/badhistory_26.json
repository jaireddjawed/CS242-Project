        "text": "This is some low hanging fruit. So low that this topic may be removed and I may be told to just post this on the Thursday topic. [But I'll give it a shot anyway](http://i.imgur.com/cKBrN8s.gifv)\n\n**Pirates of the Caribbean**\n\nThe epitome of historical accuracy in not only the state of the Caribbean in the 1700s, but also on curses, monsters, myths, and other such important things to history. Nestled deep within the film *Curse of the Black Pearl* is one small thing that caught my eye, and depending on its intention, rubbed me the wrong way. As we know, since the film has been out for 13 years, the plot surrounds Captain Barbossa retrieving the last piece of \"Aztec\" gold in order to lift the curse on him and his pirate crew. So one could assume that any other gold artifact that looked pre-Columbian shown in the film is presumably also Aztec. Well, towards the end of the film Jack Sparrow holds up a [golden figure](http://i.imgur.com/QX8gLDi.jpg) and then tosses it while talking to Barbossa before grabbing another pirate's sword to fight his former first mate.\n\nThis golden figure is problematic for several reasons. The first is, it isn't even an Aztec style figure. It isn't even Central Mexican. Heck, it isn't even contemporaneous to the Aztecs. The figure, to me, appears to based off of an Ixtlan del Rio style shaft tomb figure from West Mexico. The shaft tomb culture, which produced thousands of figures in a variety of styles both in a hollow and solid ceramic form, [dates to 300 BC to ~550 AD](https://www.academia.edu/400450/The_Chronological_Context_of_the_Central_Jalisco_Shaft_Tombs). That would place it contemporaneous with Teotihuacan, Zapotec Monte Alban, and the Classic Maya region. In fact, the shaft tomb culture has roots that go all the way back to the [Early Formative](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=957700&amp;fileId=S0956536106060172) (1500 BC to 800 BC) and [Middle Formative](http://www.famsi.org/reports/03009/03009Mountjoy01.pdf) (800 BC to 300 BC) which places it contemporaneous with the Olmec, Tlatilco, and Kaminaljuyu. But I digress, maybe the gold figure was never meant to be an Aztec object. Maybe it was just meant to be part of the booty that Barbossa and his crew collected during the reign of undead terror.\n\nExcept, until new evidence comes to light that metallurgy was [introduced to Mesoamerica](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10963-009-9021-7#/page-1) centuries earlier than we think, that gold figure cannot possibly be historically accurate. In all of the shaft tombs that have been excavated or recovered from looters, not one piece of metal has ever been recovered. [Jade objects](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=957688&amp;fileId=S0956536106060160), while rare, have been found. [Atlantic conch shells](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1845992&amp;fileId=S0956536100001334) have been found. Even a few sherds of Thin Orange ceramic from Teotihuacan, who had practically no influence in this area, have been found. The [oldest paper](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=957724&amp;fileId=S0956536106060196) (amatl) in all of Mesoamerica has been found in a shaft tomb. But not metal.\n\nAnd it isn't that West Mexico didn't [work metal](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-999-0034-6#page-1). On the contrary, the Tarascans were avid makers and users of [arsenic bronze](http://search.proquest.com/openview/83c64ae5c2af039e590888ff3aa65896/1?pq-origsite=gscholar) and [other metals](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=h_v9BfXzgt0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=tarascan+%2B+arsenic+bronze&amp;ots=9L94NuvWWr&amp;sig=B0nVhJQIPxN9zlUqqibevQVXVjU#v=onepage&amp;q=tarascan%20%2B%20arsenic%20bronze&amp;f=false). But the Tarascans and other metal using cultures date to after the shaft tomb culture. Since I study the shaft tomb culture I have neglected looking at later periods within the state I work at (Jalisco) and surrounding states (Nayarit, Zacatecas, and Colima). But I am working on remedying that blind spot to my studies. Recently I read a [chapter by Isabel Kelly](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6uva0bnth9irz4u/Kelly%201985.pdf?dl=0) on some gold and silver objects in Colima. Kelly normally dealt with the shaft tomb culture like I do. So talking about Epiclassic and Postclassic Colima was a little out of her area. Nonetheless, she was on good enough terms with looters and had connections to the Heye Foundation to draw a number of gold and silver objects that had been looted. Some of these objects, like an L-shaped serpent, was recovered from a cemetery at a site called El Chanal. The L-shaped serpent may have been a trade item, but it also may have been local. If it is local, than other L-shaped serpent ornaments in museums may be misclassified as being from another culture like [Aztec](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/310648) or [Toltec](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/313344). Other objects include these [gold discs](http://www.nmai.si.edu/searchcollections/item.aspx?irn=254265&amp;catids=2&amp;place=colima&amp;src=1-3) which kinda sorta, but not really look like the cursed Aztec gold. I'm not trying to make a connection, I just want to feature another gold object from that region.\n\nWhat about an imitation from a later metalworking culture?\n\n(copied and pasted for visibility from a comment below)\n\n&gt; An imitation is unlikely and the reason why you might find interesting.  Starting in the [6th century and moving into the 7th century](http://www.clim-past.net/11/1239/2015/cp-11-1239-2015.html) a severe multi-year drought gripped Mesoamerica. The drought not only affected crop yields, but triggered migrations for those living along the 'frontier' of where agriculture was possible. The region hit hardest was perhaps the Bajio of Guanajuato which may be the [source of Nahuatl-speaking migrants](https://www.academia.edu/400445/Controlling_for_Doubt_and_Uncertainty_Through_Multiple_Lines_of_Evidence_A_New_Look_at_the_Mesoamerican_Nahua_Migrations) for this period and [later periods](https://www.academia.edu/1485416/Power_Agency_and_Identity_Migration_and_Aftermath_in_the_Mezquital_Area_of_North-Central_Mexico) (i.e. the Aztecs). It is [believed by some](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4141553?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that [Teotihuacan](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9437589&amp;fileId=S0003598X00097714) came under some sort of attack or influence by [migrants](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440399905046) around this time. A little bit later some of these migrants ended up settling in Hidalgo and founding Tula Chico with the locals in the area. Later they would found Tula Grande and create the Toltec state which consisted of a mix of Nahuatl-migrant traditions and local traditions. \n\n&gt; [These same migrants also went to West Mexico](https://www.academia.edu/5000272/Disruption_Before_and_Behind_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Migration_in_Epiclassic_Northern_Mesoamerica). In the archaeological record there is a complete break from the end of the Classic period (~550 AD) and the start of the following Epiclassic period. [Everything changes](https://www.academia.edu/5000266/El_Grillo_and_Epilogue._The_Reestablishment_of_Community_and_Identity_in_Far_Western_Mexico). Everything. Tool types, ceramic types, ceramic designs, mortuary practices, [ritual architecture](https://www.academia.edu/400451/Corporate_Power_Strategies_In_the_Late_Formative_to_Early_Classic_Tequila_Valleys_of_Central_Jalisco), household architecture, etc. You name it, it underwent a change. And not only did everything change, the Epiclassic people did not settle on Classic period sites. They founded whole new settlements and in some cases those whole new settlements were merely nearby, but they made no use of previously built architecture. During the Epiclassic period is also when metallurgy was introduced into West Mexico which spread to the rest of Mesoamerica. So if you have this complete break from everything previous it is highly unlikely you would find an imitation of a shaft tomb figure done in gold.\n\n&gt; Why the complete change? We can only speculate right now. The likely scenario is not one of invasion in which Nahuatl migrants killed all the shaft tomb people. Instead it is probably an ideological change. You have people stuck in this severe drought with [lake levels lowering and rivers drying up](https://www.academia.edu/5000287/The_Ex-Laguna_de_Magdalena_and_pre-Columbian_settlement_in_Jalisco_Mexico_The_integration_of_archaeological_and_geomorphological_datasets). Your religious leaders who claim to be able to bring the rain or speak to the gods to petition for rain are failing you. And suddenly you have these outsiders come in looking for haven. Outsiders who see what you have to be more plentiful than what they left behind. So why not give their religious system a try? Maybe they can help bring the much needed water for your crops. And then, after trying this new system you discover that the drought is lessening. The rain is coming back, the lake is filling up. Why bother going back to the old ways when they failed you?\n\n&gt; The same kind of scenario is one to [try and explain](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=234952&amp;fileId=S0956536104151092) the [Maya Lowland abandonment](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=151951&amp;fileId=S0956536103132063) and their change from a god-king to just a king with a council and separate religious caste system. Drought may have affected some sites more than others, but once you get an ideological shift starting somewhere it can be rather hard to stop.\n\n&gt; And all of Mesoamerica underwent a change from the late 500s to early 900s. Drought, famine, warfare, ideological changes, new systems of governance, changing trade patterns. It's all a jumble. You have Nahuatl speaking Pipil people settling in El Salvador in the 900s at the same time Maya speaking Olmeca-Xicalanca people are settling at Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala. It is, in my opinion, the most interesting period in Mesoamerica.\n\nAs you can see from that chapter, none of those objects look like the object Jack Sparrow picked up. Instead, that golden figure looks more like these Ixtlan del Rio style ceramic figures.\n\n* http://collections.lacma.org/node/253536\n\n* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Seated_Couple,_Western_Mexico,_Nayarit,_Middle-late_Classic_Period,_c._200_BCE_-_200_CE,_red_clay_and_pigments,_Honolulu_Academy_of_Arts.jpg\n\n* https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/52/86/d4/5286d402f320de9dbf97dc409259ffc0.jpg\n\n* http://art.thewalters.org/detail/78412/kneeling-female-figure-holding-a-bowl/\n\nWhile I have yet to find a figure that resembles the exact one the prop crew modeled their golden figure from, you can see [some of the design elements](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Shaft_Tomb_Figures_of_West_Mexico.html?id=DZBVAAAAMAAJ) that went into it. Elements like the seated position, the pointed breasts, the cups that are being held, the multitude of earrings on each ear, and the headband going across the forehead. While I am doubtful I will ever find the exact figure the prop crew used since thousands of figures have been looted in the past and no two figures look alike, I am confident in my assessment that this is a golden shaft tomb figure and the prop crew thought they could get away with passing this object off as authentic.\n\nMy eyes are ever watchful, Disney\n\n^^^^just ^^^^forget ^^^^about ^^^^the ^^^^fact ^^^^I ^^^^am ^^^^13 ^^^^years ^^^^late ^^^^in ^^^^noticing\n\nEdit: As someone on Tumblr pointed out to me when I posted the screenshot,\n\n&gt; Can I also point out the prepared medical skull on the podium, with a calavarium cut and everything?",

That seems like enough to starkly contrast it with chattel slavery.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40h2rr/was_owning_slaves_in_the_us_limited_solely_to/cyuc4j9)\n\nR5.1: You could sell an English Colony’s  indenture's child. They weren't allowed to have kids or families without permission, which wasn’t granted, or rarely enough,  and the punishment for unauthorized marriages or children were severe and included extension of their time, monetary fines, physical punishment, and the indenture of the child until they were 30 in some colonies. \n\n[\"their children were entirely free.\", etc etc.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40h2rr/was_owning_slaves_in_the_us_limited_solely_to/cyuaa73)\n\nSame R5.1: They were not. They inherited their parent’s indentured status. \n\nI see this whenever the subject of Irish or White Slavery as a comparison with Black Slavery is raised. It occurs regularly and is upvoted here, such as this post months ago, where for some reason the statement: \n\n[Indentured servants had legal rights that those being held in chattel slavery didn't. The right to marry was one, the right to not be split up as a family was another.](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/39ul1p/irish_slavery_in_til_they_were_sold_as_slaves_and/cs6ml5j)\n\nWas called out, by no one. The above links are badhistory. Repeated, and copied, and deeply held, and  simply and completely wrong. The Archived link above is also just garbage. Some slaves in the Spanish speaking colonies where the inquisition was strong actually had the right to marry and not be separated because marriage was a sacrament. This was not the case for indentures or slaves in the English Colonies. \n\nSummary R5.1:  This is a common misconception. Indentures weren't allowed to have children or even marry without permission. If they did, then time was added to their indenture. Whether they had permission or not, the children were automatically indentured to the master by law for a duration of between 14 and 30 years depending on the custom of the colony, to pay for their upkeep and the loss of service from the mother, and father if he could be found and would admit the child was his. The Children were sadly not born free. And their indentures, meaning themselves, could certainly be sold by whoever held the indenture. This stems from Tudor Era poor laws and was imported into the new world. It wasn't something the Americans invent later. And keep in mind, my argument isn't \"The children inherited the status, so they were slaves!\" My argument is \"The children were in fact born into an indenture, they were not free. Saying they were is incorrect.\"\n\nEdit 1 Sources: \n\n* Bentley, William (1654), Acts and statutes of the island of Barbados London: Printed by Will.

Where they begin to slip is with\n \n&gt;An indentured servant remains a person in law with rights and dignities\n\nThe reason being not to assert that the Mods answer to the intitial question was badhistory. By the time there was a USA, racial slavery was certainly encoded. \n\nBut rather that the lengthy context they provide in terms of right(s) thereafter. It is not accurate for the territory they have slipped into: The Caribbean prior to the 18th century. Because the poster cites Hilary Beckles at the end of the answer and Beckles doesn’t agree that servants had right(s) and or dignities. In fact of the servant’s rights, the book that the mod quotes, has Beckles saying this on page 5 of the book cited: \n\n&gt;They possessed one right – to complain to the planter-magistrates concerning excessively violent abuse, but this right, which by custom was also available to black slaves in some societies, had little or no mitigating effect on the overall nature of their treatment on the estates.\n\nR5.2: Summary. So on the original question, the Top Level Poster wasn’t wrong. And I am not arguing here whether Beckles’ is right here or not. The  post has Beckles as a source. And Beckles wouldn't agree with the \"we have to be careful\" context. What I am saying is badhistory here is the way that citations are done in this post, and by referral, all over every history forum here. Sourcing an author as part of a large set of paragraphs, without context, citations or page numbers  gives the impression that the source agrees with the whole text. Or rather it implies that the author sourced, doesn’t disagree. Hilary Beckles would not in fact based on his work agree with the extra Caribbean context portion of the top level response, his books and articles make that clear. Furthermore the Top Level Poster conflates throughout the answer the USA and the BNA Caribbean and ignores the fact that prisoners sentenced to servitude fell under a different body of British law than free willed indentures. Additionally the whole thread  ignores the French and Spanish American Colonies, who for example thought the British system was unimaginably cruel and only indentured for 3 years. And if a slave marriage as an example was performed by a priest, it WAS recongized in Spanish Colonies. The world is larger than the languages you speak. The entire thing is just amateurish.\n\nR5.3: This is the last one and runs through the entire thread. The continuous assertion that servants were legally recognized as people and chattel slaves were not recognized with legal personhood. Orlando Patterson debunked this in 1982. \n\nPatterson’s explanations for what a slave is and isn’t, make a mockery of most of the public discourse and even some veteran academics, like Eltis, Akenson, and Rodgers. The tropes are far too trusted. Certain sources haven’t ever been checked. Or if they have, no one is aware that the academic sources which are quoted by “public historians” as well, are simply wrong. Here’s what Patterson says on page 22 of Slavery and Social Death about salves and legal personhood. \n\n&gt; Another fallacy that we can quickly dispose of is the common definition of a slave as someone without a legal personality. “The conventional legal explanation of personality,” writes G. B. J. Hughes, “is that a person in law is an entity which may be the bearer of rights and duties.” Even if we rephrase the words “rights\" and “duties” in realist terms - the stricto sensu, for example, of the technical terminology of Hohfeld - we find that the idea of the slave as someone without a legal personality has no basis in legal practice. It is a fiction found only in western societies, and even there it has been taken seriously more by legal philosophers than by practicing lawyers. As a legal fact, there has never existed a slaveholding society, ancient or modern, that did not recognize the slave as a person in law. All we need do to demonstrate this is to examine the legal response in slaveholding societies to the delicts of slaves: in all cases the slave is held legally and morally responsible...\n\nR5.3: Summary Slaves aren’t legal persons? Then why are they punished for breaking the law? Do you punish your real estate? Does real estate have a legal responsibility to not disobey the law? \n\nEdit 2. To be absolutely clear the argument Patterson is making is not that there weren't laws or customs that point out that slaves were declared to not be legally competent, or to have no legal personality.  But that those laws are a fiction, or smoke screen used by slave holding societies to buttress their oppressive systems.\n\nHe's saying that the legal status of non-competance or non-existence is a sham a fiction, a lie. A de jure system that hides the defacto truth. He's saying that they were claimed to have no legal personality, they were labeled alieni juris or whatever term you like i.e. real estate. And then in order to use the courts to maintain their slave systems when and if they broke the law they were treated like they did have comptetence because if you are alieni juris, then you can't be held responsible for your actions. It's part of the fiction that makes every single slave society he studied possible.\n\nWe today do not hold people who are not legally competent, criminally responsible. If you're crazy, or mentally impaired you're supposed to get treatment, not punishment. But slave societies say, we can hold these people as slaves, they aren't really people. Servus non habet persona. A slave has no personality. Therefore we can keep them. They aren't a person.\n\nThey declare them legally incompetant, and non existant before the courts but still then hold them criminally and civilly responsible for any crime they might have committed. That makes the declaration of a lack of legal personhood a sham. That's where the fiction of them not being people breaks down. If they really weren't \"people in law\" then they couldn't carry any legal respionsibility whatsover. And Patterson is saying that every system did exactly that. And that's certainly true. \n\nOverall the thread in askhistorians is just chock full of the same kind of inaccuracies and misinterpretations, conflations and bad history that Patterson talks about in Slavery and Social Death, paradoxically without the top level response being basically incorrect. It's the conflation of time periods and contextual  and factual inaccuracies that follow that correct answer that make it bad. And it is. The only thing that stinks worse is the fanboy response here that dogmatically defends ancient and modren slavers' own rhetoric for them.  Boo. \n\n\nAll links are NP. \n\n",

I love the topic, but this book is somehow as boring as it is interesting. \n\nA few nights ago I began wondering how accurate the book is, since the author describes himself as a math teacher who became interested in history one day... Some internetting led me to [this review](http://www.ams.org/notices/200201/rev-dauben.pdf) published in a journal from the AMS. The review is basically already an /r/badhistory post.\n\nWhat I thought was most interesting were the errors passed on by citations. First from misreading a source:\n\n&gt;As for Chinese written calculation, Martzloff warns of Ifrah’s uncritical use of Karl Menninger’s *Number Words and Number Symbols. A Cultural History of Numbers* (1957), where it is said that written calculations in China were explained in the *Ding Ju Suanfa* (*The Arithmetic of Ding Ju* (1355)), along with the method of checking a calculation by casting out nines. In fact, casting out nines does not appear in the *Ding Ju Suanfa*, and it was not until the seventeenth century that European missionaries introduced the method.\n\n&gt; How could Menninger have made such an egregious error, one that Ifrah unfortunately repeats? It turns out that the text of the *Ding Ju Suanfa* was included with another, the *Tongwen Suanzhi* (*Treatise on European Arithmetic* (1613)), when the two were reprinted together in Shanghai in 1936. In using this edition, Menninger simply failed to distinguish one from the other! But the error is reproduced by Ifrah and made all the more damaging because it causes him to misdate the chronology of the appearance of written calculations in China by several centuries.\n\nThere's also another author's hypothesis turning into fact in a scholarly game of telephone.\n\n&gt;Another main source upon which Ifrah depends is volume three of Joseph Needham’s important series, *Science and Civilisation in China*, the first part of which is devoted to mathematics. As Martzloff points out, although Needham does mention a counting board on occasion, he does so only in passing, and It is clear that it is nothing more than a hypothesis. But most who have written subsequently about Chinese mathematics based upon Needham’s account have forgotten the hypothetical character of his remarks and have simply advanced from hypothesis to certainty. One of these is Geneviève Guitel, who in her *Histoire Comparée des Numérations Écrites* (1975) writes as if counting tables were not hypothetical but objects that really existed. Ifrah draws heavily on Guitel but goes even further, and, relying with great imagination on the rare pictorial images that exist relative to the practice of calculation, he produces from a late (sixteenth century) Chinese illustration a model “truer than nature” (Martzloff, p. 678) of a Chinese counting rod table.\n\n&gt;There is nothing provisional about Ifrah’s statement: “For arithmetical calculation, the Chinese used little rods made of ivory or bamboo called *chou* (calculating rods) which were placed on the squares of a tiled surface or a table ruled like a checkerboard” (p. 283). But this, says Martzloff, is pure fantasy, and the illustration (drawn by Ifrah himself) is not based on any real artifact or printed source describing such a table. What Ifrah starts from is an illustration from the *Suanfa Tongzong* (*General Source of Computational Methods*), a 1592 book about the abacus. But that work does not treat counting rods, and the illustration from it cannot plausibly be interpreted as a counting board.\n\nOther errors come from the classic mistake of inventing a narrative that goes beyond the evidence. I get the impression that Ifrah wanted there to actually be a complete history with satisfying answers, instead of a partial understanding based on limited information. He includes a ton of primary sources, but the conclusions are a little thin. \n\n&gt;But once more there is virtually no evidence upon which to base such assumptions. What Ifrah offers instead is the fact that the Incas used some sort of counting board to manipulate counters to facilitate their arithmetic. He refers to an illustration from the Peruvian Codex of Guaman Poma de Ayale of the sixteenth century (Ifrah’s Fig. 22.20, *Numbers*, p. 308). However, this is a counting board, not an abacus, and there is no indication of how it would have been used and whether it followed a decimal, vigesimal, or some other arrangement. And in any case, this has no connection with the Maya! All Ifrah is able to provide is conjecture because, as Cauty puts it, he cannot conceive of a civilization without a highly developed sense of arithmetic and some means of both carrying out arithmetic operations and then recording the results. Cauty is rightly dubious, since there is not the least bit of archaeological or textual evidence for the existence of a Mayan abacus.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; As Filliozat points out, the existence of the abacus at an early date is not documented in India; there is no archaeological evidence, and there are no literary descriptions or texts to bear out any of the speculations Ifrah presents. There is not even a word for “abacus” in Sanskrit, Filliozat notes (Filliozat, p. 547)\n\nAlso there's this. A little awkward. \n\n&gt;The final but greatest problem Ritter finds with Ifrah’s interpretation of the Mesopotamian record is “ignorance pure and simple.” Ifrah boasts of his having deciphered the proto-Elamite numerical systems, a means of writing developed in ancient Iran towards the end of the third millennium. But Ritter points out that this had already been accomplished by Assyriologists before any of Ifrah’s publications, thanks primarily to the research of Joran Friberg, Peter Damerow, and Robert Englund.\n\nFinally this (from [their review](http://www.ams.org/notices/200202/rev-dauben.pdf) of volume 2, *The Universal History of Computing*) isn't badhistory, but it made me laugh. I'm picturing someone frantically writing an essay the day before it's due. \n\n&gt; As if acknowledging the hopelessness of his chronology of the major steps “from calculation to calculus” when it comes to the first half of the twentieth century, this is—*verbatim*—what Ifrah writes:\n&gt;&gt;This period saw fundamental contributions from Western mathematicians and logicians to the development of contemporary mathematics and logic, especially in the areas of algorithmic logic and symbolic calculus. Notable figures in this history are G. Frege, G. Peano, B. Russell, A. N. Whitehead, D. Hilbert, E. Zermelo, E. Steinitz, R. Carnap, E. Artin, K. Gödel, E. Post, S. C. Kleene, A. Turing, A. Church, J.  von  Neumann,  A.  A.  Markov, P. S. Novikov, H. Cartan, C. Chevalley, J. Delsarte, J. Dieudonné, A. Weil; and of course many others. (Computing, p. 85)",

        "text": "This comment comes from a thread on r/Christianity/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/407kvi/jesus_and_pagan_roots_of_christianity_myth/cytqjsc\n\nWe've all heard this nonsense before, the claim is Jesus is copied from pagan gods and religions. It's the classic \"Christ myth theory\" nonsense where the proposition is that Jesus is just an invented literary character inspired by numerous Pagan gods who apparantely have alleged similarities to Jesus (which end up not being so similar after-all). The common most frequently cited gods being Horus, Adonis, Mithras and Dionysus. The claims made follow as such:\n\n* These gods all had virgin births, performed the same miracles as Jesus and ended up dying (some by crucifixion) before resurrecting.\n\nWhen we read the stories of these gods however, we find these claims to be nonsense.\n\nOne particular claim of similarity comes from Bill Maher who made this claim of Horus in his Religulous documentary:\n\n&gt;Written in 1280 B.C., the Book of the Dead describes a God, Horus. Horus is the son of the god Osiris, born to a virgin mother. He was baptized in a river by Anup the Baptizer who was later beheaded. Like Jesus, Horus was tempted while alone in the desert, healed the sick, the blind, cast out demons, and walked on water. He raised Asar from the dead. “Asar” translates to “Lazarus.” Oh, yeah, he also had twelve disciples. Yes, Horus was crucified first, and after three days, two women announced Horus, the savior of humanity, had been resurrected.\n\nThese claims all come from the discredited source of Gerald Massey and are not mentioned in any Egyptian document or record.\n\nIn actuality Horus was not born by a virgin birth but rather by the union of Osiris and Isis. He did not perform the same miracles as Jesus, Anup the Baptizer is a fabricated character based on Anubis who did not baptise people, Horus was not tempted in the desert (he battles Set in the desert), he did not raise anyone from the dead, he was not crucified, he did not have twelve disciples and he was not considered the savior of humanity.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.laits.utexas.edu/cairo/teachers/osiris.pdf\n\nhttp://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/horus.htm\n\nNew York Folklore Quarterly, Volume 29\n\nhttp://www.jonsorensen.net/2012/10/25/horus-manure-debunking-the-jesushorus-connection/\n\nThe same is often claimed of Adonis.\n\nIn actuality, Adonis was born either from Phoenix and Aephesiboea, or Cinyras and Metharme, another legend says he was born from an incestuous relationship between Myrrha and her father. Either way not a virgin birth and certainly not a god. Adonis was not crucified and his \"resurrection\" is annually. He would spend six months in Hell (Hades) with Persephone and then the other six months Aphrodite on Earth. Technically he was torn between two lovers. He was not the savior of humanity and did not die for humanity (he was killed by a wild boar sent by Artemis).\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/adonis.html\nhttp://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/myth-aphrodite-adonis/\n\n\nMithras and Dionysus are the same here too. Mithras was not born of a virgin (he was born from a rock), was not considered a savoir, was not crucified and if anything, the Mithras cult begun stealing from Christianity (this is what the 2nd century Christian writer Justin Martyr claimed). Dionysus was born between the relationship between Zeus and Semele, she died during sexual intercourse forcing Zeus to take the unborn god and put him into his thigh where he grew as a baby. He was not crucified and did not resurrect. He was brought back to life at one point but that was by when Zeus (or Rhea in other legends) had to assemble all the dismembered parts of Dionysus to bring him back to life.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Dionysus/dionysus.html\nhttp://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosMyths.html\nhttp://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/mithras/\n\nIn a last desperate attempt, we have two other comments, considering Richard Carrier a legit source on Jesus and the pagan gods.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/407kvi/jesus_and_pagan_roots_of_christianity_myth/cysknv8\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/407kvi/jesus_and_pagan_roots_of_christianity_myth/cyt04q7\n\nRichard Carrier argues this:\n\n&gt;\"The only pre-Christian man to be buried and resurrected and deified in his own lifetime, that I know of, is the Thracian god Zalmoxis (also called Salmoxis or Gebele'izis), who is described in the mid-5th-century B.C.E. by Herodotus (4.94-96), and also mentioned in Plato's Charmides (156d-158b) in the early-4th-century B.C.E. According to the hostile account of Greek informants, Zalmoxis buried himself alive, telling his followers he would be resurrected in three years, but he merely resided in a hidden dwelling all that time. His inevitable \"resurrection\" led to his deification, and a religion surrounding him, which preached heavenly immortality for believers, persisted for centuries.\n\n&gt;The only case, that I know, of a pre-Christian god actually being crucified and then resurrected is Inanna (also known as Ishtar), a Sumerian goddess whose crucifixion, resurrection and escape from the underworld is told in cuneiform tablets inscribed c. 1500 B.C.E., attesting to a very old tradition. The best account and translation of the text is to be found in Samuel Kramer's History Begins at Sumer, pp. 154ff., but be sure to use the third revised edition (1981), since the text was significantly revised after new discoveries were made. For instance, the tablet was once believed to describe the resurrection of Inanna's lover, Tammuz (also known as Dumuzi). Graves thus mistakenly lists Tammuz as one of his \"Sixteen Crucified Saviors.\" Of course, Graves cannot be discredited for this particular error, since in his day scholars still thought the tablet referred to that god (Kramer explains how this mistake happened).\"\n\nZalmoxis is not born of a virgin, he was not crucified and he fakes his death so never actually resurrected.\n\nhttp://www.mircea-eliade.com/from-primitives-to-zen/036.html\n\n&gt;(Herodotus, 'History.' IV, 93-6)\nZalmoxis (Saitnoxis) was the Supreme God of the Getae (or Dacians), a Thracian people inhabiting a territory including today's Rotnania, but also extending farther cast and northeast. Our only important information concerning this rather enigmatic deity is the text of Herodotus quoted below. The scholars have interpreted Zalmoxis as a Sky-god, a god of the dead, a Mystery-god, etc.\n\n&gt;But before he came to the Ister, he first subdued the Getae, who pretend to be immortal. The Thracians of Salmydessus and of the country above the towns of Appolonia and Mesambria, who are called Cyrmaianae and Nipsaei, surrendered themselves unresisting to Darius; but the Getae, who are the bravest and most law-abiding of all Thracians, resisted with obstinacy, and were enslaved forthwith.\n\n&gt;As to their claim to be immortal, this is how they show it: they believe that they do not die, but that he who perishes goes to the god Salmoxis of Gebelexis, as some of them call him. Once in every five years they choose by lot one of their people and send him as a messenger to Salmoxis, charged to tell of their needs; and this is their manner of sending: Three lances are held by men thereto appointed; others seize the messenger to Salmoxis by his hands and feet, and swing and hurl him aloft on to the spear-point. If he be killed by the cast, they believe that the gods regard them with favour; but if he be not killed, they blame the messenger himself, deeming him a bad man, and send another messenger in place of him whom they blame. It is while the man yet lives that they charge him with the message. Moreover when there is thunder and lightning these same Thracians shoot arrows skyward as a threat to the god, believing in no other god but their own.\n\n&gt;For myself, I have been told by the Greeks who dwell beside the Hellespont and Pontus that this Salmoxis was a man who was once a slave in Samos, his master being Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus; presently, after being freed and gaining great wealth, he returned to his own country. Now the Thracians were a meanly-living and simple witted folk, but this Salmoxis knew Ionian usages and a fuller way of life than the Thracian; for he had consorted with Greeks, and moreover with one of the greatest Greek teachers, Pythagoras; wherefore he made himself a hall, where he entertained and feasted the chief among his countrymen, and taught them that neither he nor his guests nor any of their descendants should ever die, but that they should go to a place where they would live for ever and have all good things. While he was doing as I have said and teaching this doctrine, he was all the while making him an underground chamber. When this was finished, he vanished from the sight of the Thracians, and descended into the underground chamber, where he lived for three years, the Thracians wishing him back and mourning him for dead; then in the fourth year he appeared to the Thracians, and thus they came to believe what Salmoxis had told them. Such is the Greek story about him.\n\n&gt;For myself, I neither disbelieve nor fully believe the tale about Salmoxis and his underground chamber; but I think that he lived many years before Pythagoras; and whether there was a man called Salmoxis, or this be the name the Getae for a god of their country, I have done with him.\n\nInanna isn't crucified at all. She is struck down and has her corpse hung \"from a hook\" according to the story. She was resurrected when two beings named gala-tura and the kur-jara were sent to rescue her, bringing her back by a \"life giving plant\" and \"life giving water.\"\n\n&gt;164-172 After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed, they were carried away. Then she made her sister Erec-ki-gala rise from her throne, and instead she sat on her throne. The Anuna, the seven judges, rendered their decision against her. They looked at her -- it was the look of death. They spoke to her -- it was the speech of anger. They shouted at her -- it was the shout of heavy guilt. The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse. And the corpse was hung on a hook.\n\n&gt;273-281 They were offered a river with its water -- they did not accept it. They were offered a field with its grain -- they did not accept it. They said to her: \"Give us the corpse hanging on the hook.\" Holy Erec-ki-gala answered the gala-tura and the kur-jara: \"The corpse is that of your queen.\" They said to her: \"Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen, give it to us.\" They were given the corpse hanging on the hook. One of them sprinkled on it the life-giving plant and the other the life-giving water. And thus Inana arose.\n\nhttp://www.ancient.eu/article/215/\nhttp://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htm\n\nIt seems all these connections to Jesus focus on the resurrection of these pagan gods (which in no way match the resurrection of Jesus or why he resurrected). The proponents of this theory seem to ignore details as they desperately try to link Jesus as being a literary invention inspired by these Gods. Their logic is if a god performs a miracle, it doesn't matter if the miracle isn't the same as the miracles of Jesus, it's a miracle nonetheless and Jesus performed miracles ergo Jesus is a copy. It's terrible reasoning.\n\nAs a deist, I obviously do not believe in the resurrection or virgin birth but to claim that because other gods resurrected, that Jesus was a copy cat character, is to simply misrepresent facts. The virgin birth of Jesus and resurrection stand as unique events and from my deist perspective, the resurrection doesn't have a pagan origin but a practical one to rally the fleeing followers of Jesus who disbanded after his death.\n\nThere is simply no historical basis behind the idea that Jesus is a literary character inspired by pagan gods, that he was an invention of the Jews who at the time were predicting a Messiah during a period where several other self-declared Messiahs wondered around prophesying. Did pagan religions later influence portrayals of Jesus in early Christianity? Probable. Mary holding the child Jesus is similar to the iconography between Horus and his mother. However this doesn't validate the claim that Jesus was a copy-cat of these pagan gods.\n\nAfter examining the real story of these gods, we see the alleged similarities aren't similarities at all.\n\nFinally, after doing away with all these alleged similarities, we arrive at the extra-Biblical evidences for the existence of Jesus from several sources:\n\n*   Josephus\n*   Tacitus\n*   Suetonius\n*   Julius Africanus\n*   Origen\n*   Pliny the Younger\n\nJosephus (A.D. 37 - c. A.D. 100)\n\nJosephus' Antiquities (early 2nd century A.D.) refers to Jesus in two separate passages. The common translation of the first passage, Book 18, Ch. 3, part 3, is disputed and is most likely from an altered source. F. F. Bruce has provided a more likely translation:\n\nNow there arose at this time a source of further trouble in one Jesus, a wise man who performed surprising works, a teacher of men who gladly welcome strange things. He led away many Jews, and also many of the Gentiles. He was the so-called Christ. When Pilate, acting on information supplied by the chief men around us, condemned him to the cross, those who had attached themselves to him at first did not cease to cause trouble, and the tribe of Christians, which has taken this name from him is not extinct even today.\n\nThe translations of this passage are discussed in Josephus: Testimonium Flavianum from Jesus.com.au.\n\nThe second passage is from Book 20, Ch. 9, part 1:\n\n...so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned...\n\nMany critics say Josephus is forged but the only proven tampering was an alteration in the first passage to make it read as follows:\n\nAbout this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Christ. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.\n\nThe alteration was to make certain that Jesus was the Christ but the passage overrall is still considered authentic.\n\nThe second passage shows no signs of tampering at all and is considered fully authentic.\n\n\nTacitus (c. A.D. 55 - c. A.D. 117)\n\nAnnals, book XV:\n\nConsequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.\n\nSuetonius (c. A.D. 69 - c. A.D. 140)\n\nLives of the Caesars - Claudius, sec. 25:\n\nSince the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome.\n\nLives of the Caesars - Nero, sec. 16\n\nPunishment was inflicted on the Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition.\n\nIn Acts of the Apostles (18:2) the writer makes the following parallel commentary:\n\n\"And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them\"\n\nTo agree with the reasoning of Robert E. Van Voorst on this, it's not plausible that a later Christian interpolator would have called Jesus \"Chrestus\", placed him in Rome in 49, or called him a \"troublemaker\" this has thus led to the overwhelming majority of scholars to conclude that the passage is authentic.\n\nJulius Africanus (c. 160 - c. 240)\n\nChronography, XVIII refers to writings by Thallus and Phlegon concerning the darkness during the Crucifixion:\n\nOn the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun...Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth - manifestly that one of which we speak.\n\nThallus was a first century historian, his work was mostly lost but what we do know on what he said here comes from Julius Africanus above and can be considered authentic too.\n\nOrigen (c. 185 - c. 254)\n\nIn Against Celsus, Origen quotes Celsus, a second-century skeptic, on Jesus. Celsus' view of Christians and Christianity, an article from Bluffton College, contains relevant excerpts.\n\nPliny the Younger (c. 62 - c. 113)\n\nLetters, 10.96-97 records Pliny's dealings with Christians\n\nThese mentions of Jesus and the early Christian followers, specifically the references to Jesus as a real person are enough to validate Jesus as a real historical person who preached in Judea, was tried by Pontius Pilate and later crucified.",

But \nI'm trying to get back into it, because /r/badhistory deserves this, and I need a distraction, and you all need\na reason to get even more drunk.\n\nI read \"Killing Patton\" by Bill O'Reilly and someone called Martin Dugard, so that you don't have to.  You don't *want* to.\nDo not read this book, and if you do, do NOT make a badhistory drinking game out of it, becuase IT WILL KILL YOU AND YOU\nWILL DIE.\n\nSo, to demonstrate ... **Page Fucking 1**.  The offending passage, wherein a US Army PFC is participating in the assault\non Driant, October of '44:\n\n&gt;Over his shoulder, Holmlund wears a block of TNT known as a satchel charge\n\nThis makes me twitch a bit, but ... it *might* be true.  I'm pretty sure no standard issue satchel charge for the U.S. Army\nwould've been pure TNT instead of tetrytol (which is less accidentally explody), but a field-expedient version *might* be. \nIt's still a bit dubious.\n\n&gt;Grenades dangle from his cartride belt like grapes on a vine.  And in his arms, rather than carrying it by the wooden\nhandle atop the stock, Holmlund cradles his fifteen-pound, four-foot-long Browning Automatic Rifle\n\nOK, if this didn't instantly trigger your /r/badhistory senses, I'm not sure why you're here.  Because, of course, the \nWWII-era BAR didn't *have* a carry handle.\n\nThere's actually a really detailed page on the T4 BAR Carry Handle, because of course there is.  I'd recommend reading it, because it's got pictures and I don't, and its conclusion is thusly (emphasis on the last line):\n\n&gt;The combination of M45 Pack, Carry Handle and Canvas Sling in use by the Army units, 96th, 81st, 77th, 27th or 7th divisions \non Okinawa during WWII is very very unlikely. This conclusion is based on examing photos of those 3 divisions and the lack of \nM45 packs and overwhelming total absence of carry handles and predominance of leather slings on their BAR's. \n\n&gt;The carry handle assembly is very questionable for PTO impressoins. In many ways, the carry handle is much like the bayonet \nlug on the M1 Carbine: There are reports and purported photographs of its use, but the photographs are difficult to find, and \nwhen those photographs are scrutinized, it is difficult to conclusively say that it is associated with a specific wartime combat \naction. Until conclusive photographic proof of the BAR carry handle in use during an identified wartime combat action can be \nfound, the carry handle is incorrect for use. \n\n&gt;**The T4 carry handle has NOT been observed or rumored to have been in any wartime photographs of US Army troops in the European \nTheater of Operations. The use of the carry handle for ETO impressions is strictly farb!**\n\nLink to this perfect page of pedentry, which exists for some reason:\n\nhttp://www.90thidpg.us/Equipment/Articles/BARHandle/\n\n... with all sorts of nice pictures and sources.\n\nI suspect the authors may have confused either re-enactment BARs as WWII accurate, or maybe even just vaguely remembered what\nan FN-FAL looked like.  Given the rest of the book, it's likely just pure ignorance by an amateur historian and a bombastic blow-hard.\n\nAnd honestly, that's as far as I can go today.  I just needed a quick distraction, it just gets worse from there (again, this is the *first page*), and there's football to be watched.\n\n ",

        "text": "reposted from yesterday due to problems a mod had with the old title\n******************************************\n\nI've seen a small piece of badhistory been thrown around a fair amount in modern attempts to invoke muslim-Christian relations in the middle ages. The specific instance i'll cite is [this one](http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/12/23/isis-vs-history/). Its not the worst misuse of this by far but it is the straw that broke the preverbial camel's back.\n\n&gt; But far from being an age of brutality, the “medieval period” of Islamic history was defined by its relative tolerance. One of the greatest of cities in 10th-century Europe was Muslim Córdoba. Astonished Christian visitors such as the itinerant German nun Hrostsvita of Gandersheim recognized Córdoba as an “Ornament of the World.” Its shine came from the fact that Córdoba had street lamps that glowed at night, reflecting the running water of fountains and the light of knowledge and science from a library that rivaled ancient Alexandria. Although lower in status under Islamic law, minorities were not only protected in Islamic cities like Córdoba\n\n&gt;This badhistory invokes Hrotsvita's (author mispells her name, understandable but pendantic strike one) phrase The Ornament of the World to show a shinning beacon of something like multiculturalism and common respect.\n\nI wanted a better example so i quickly went on google news and found this https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/david-ignatius-recapturing-the-arab-muslim-worlds-golden-age/2013/07/12/e21d4bc8-ea68-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html\n\n&gt;Talking about this unfolding tragedy in Egypt with my friend Melhem, I thought he was right to focus on the openness and tolerance of the Moorish kings of Andalusia. It was this sophistication that gave Cordoba its reputation as “the ornament of the world.” It wasn’t only Muslims who prospered in 9th-century Andalusia but Jews and Christians as well.\n\nspoiler alert: The actual story is one of an abused male noble christian child with a hell of a right hook and an ability to survive murder attempts that defies belief and the caliph's temper. I could get into the larger meta narrative but this is more pedantic than that: the quote doesn't say what he thinks it says.\n\nSaint Pelagius (unconnected to the bloke who'se missing a pelvus) was a Christian Galacian captive/political prisoner/hostage at the court of the Ummayad Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III after his uncle welched on a deal to pay the Caliph the money that was due for his ransom (Pelagius offered to be imprisoned in the uncle's place while he raised the money). While imprisoned he catches the male Caliph's eye (totally a thing the nun was cool with...NOT). He tries to kiss Pelagius, Pelagius refuses him, he tries again and gets a bloody punch to the face and is then defenestrated decastletrated via a nice large catapult. The catapult cat-a-couldn't kill him and thus the Caliph decided to not be a catoon supervillain (or the 860s Joker was a much darker figure than Adam West's nemises) and just cut the guy's head off instead of undergoing more elaborate rituals of murder. Pelagius obliged the caliph and stayed dead this time.\n\nSo this is the story the German Nun was telling when she talked about the ornament of the world. Now lets look at the opening where the phrase is used.\n\n&gt;In the western regions, there shone a fair ornament of the world, an august city, proud as a result of its newfound military might, a city that had been founded by Spanish settlers and was known by the famous name of Córdoba; a wealthy city, renowned for its charms, splendid in all of its resources, overflowing in particular in the seven streams of knowledge, and ever noted for its continual victories In previous times this city had been fully subject to the true Christ, abounding with white-robed children baptized to the Lord. But all of a sudden a belligerent power overturned the well-established laws of the sacred faith and, spreading the error of its nefarious teachings, inflicted injury on its faithful citizens. The perfidious nation of the indomitable Saracens enticed the strong inhabitants of this city to war and forcefully took control of the destiny of this glorious kingdom. They exterminated the good king, cleansed as he had been by baptism, the king who had rightfully carried the royal scepter and who had so often restrained the citizens with appropriate laws. Now the people that he had left behind, overcome by the enemy sword, were defeated with great slaughter. Finally a perverse man, profane in both his life and his rite, appropriated the destiny of that entire kingdom to himself. [This perverse man] placed his nefarious associates in the depopulated countryside and filled the mournful city with no few of his enemy forces.\n&gt;#Pitiful to relate, he polluted [Córboba,] that venerable mother of pure faith,\n\n&gt;with a barbaric rite by mixing his pagans among the rightful inhabitants, so that the former might induce the latter to abandon the ways of their fathers, and thus defile them through profane association with [the pagans].\n\n&gt;These things [dhimmi stuff mentioned in cut portion] having been done, the faithful city rested in feigned peace, buried amidst a thousand evils. But any of those in whom the fire of the love of Christ burned and felt compelled by a thirst for martyrdom to defame with words the marble [images] that the prince, prostrate and adorned with a crown, venerated with Sabean incense, these he condemned to immediate death; their souls, purified by their own blood, made their way to heaven.\n\n\"Pitiful to relate, he polluted [Córboba,] that venerable mother of pure faith\" paints a much different picture than the normal one given. How can we square the two pictures (hint see the title). It turns out the building up of the Cordoba is in part a rhetorical device by the Nun to contrast the decadent sinful muslim city today with the pure self denying virtues of Christianity and the saint. The entire pov of this narrative is incredibly hostile towards a simplistic \"rah rah convivencia rah rah\" argument the phrase gets trotted out to defend as the Monk's vision of Andalusia is one of a false peace where divine intervention not muslim magniminity or sacred duty provides limited protection to minority religions and those religions are suffering under a \"false peace\" and the narrative is an aborted rape narrative which isn't hard to read into. Cordoba thus instead of being a shining beacon of 9th century tolerance is, in this Nun's work which continues to be cited, a once proud and mighty city ruined by \"pagan\" islamic rulers who erect a beautiful facade hiding (or not) the vice within.\n\nmain source. Also used it for citing the Hroswitha piece because while i've read the actual text finding 10th century random german texts online is hard.\n\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&amp;context=pomona_fac_pub\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3zt23h/more_yugoslavia_badhistory_ed_herman_and_david/",
        "text": "So, you may recall a while back [I wrote a piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3chqxh/ed_hermans_srebrenica_denial_a_refutation/) on Ed Herman and David Peterson and their vile but also rather bizarre denialism regarding the Srebrenica Massacre. Well, turns out they’ve also written a more extended [‘history’ of the Yugoslav Wars](http://monthlyreview.org/2007/10/01/the-dismantling-of-yugoslavia). And by ‘history’, I mean lots of thinly veiled Serb nationalist Lost Cause-ism, Mladic did nothing wrong, Izetbegovic is literally Hitler/Lincoln and so on. I’m not going to go through line by line, because it goes on for 4 parts plus a glossary and timeline and most of it is pointless polemic, but I do want to address some of the more blatant falsehoods, as well as particularly bad misrepresentations of evidence that make me very sceptical of just about everything Herman and Peterson (H-P from now on) say.\n\nOk, let’s start with Part 1. On the elections of 1990:\n\n&gt; In April 1990, both Slovenia and Croatia held the first multiparty elections in Yugoslavia since the late 1930s… In Croatia, Franjo Tudjman’s blatantly nationalistic and separatist Croatian Democratic Union received 70 percent.\n\nEr, no, it didn’t. It’s hard to give an overall figure of what proportions parties received as Croatia had a tricameral parliament elected by a two-round system, so in effect there were six elections. But in none of them did the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) get above 44% of the vote. And they only won 58% of the seats. No idea where they got 70% from, and no citation anyway.\n\nOn the Badinter Commission set up to arbitrate on the legal questions surrounding the breakup of Yugoslavia:\n\n&gt; On each of the major issues contested by the Serbian republic, the commission ruled against Serbia. Yugoslavia was “in the process of dissolution,” the commission’s notorious Opinion No. 1 stated when published on December 7, 1991. Similarly, Opinion No. 2 held that “the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina…[does not] have the right to self-determination,” though it “is entitled to all the rights concerned to minorities and ethnic groups under international law….”\n\nOnly the latter quoted section actually comes from the ruling of Opinion 2. The first section comes from *the question*, which was “Does the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have the right to self-determination?”. And contrary to what H-P claim, Badinter did not simply answer “No”, in fact if anything it said “Yes”. However, the Commission crucially ruled that the right to *self-determination* did not automatically mean a right of *secession* (which is what H-P think it ought to mean), merely a right to define one’s own national/ethnic/cultural identity and have the state recognise that. Now you can agree or disagree with the decision all you want, but don’t misrepresent what it says.\n\n&gt; More provocative yet, whereas the UN admitted all three breakaway republics as member states on May 22, it withheld the admission of a successor state to the dismantled Yugoslavia for another eight-and-a-half years; the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, often denigrated as the “rump” Yugoslavia, was not admitted until November 1, 2000, almost four weeks after Milosevic’s ouster.\n\nNot exactly – the FRY did not actually apply to be admitted. They insisted that they automatically inherit the SFR Yugoslavia’s seat instead, which was something they knew full well was never going to happen, making their absence more of a boycott than a rejection.\n\nOn to Part 2: On the numbers killed at Srebrenica:\n\n&gt; As Michael Mandel writes, a “majority of a maximum of 7,000–8,000 would put the maximum executed closer to 4,000”—or roughly one-half that of the standard view.\n\nEr, why? Why does a majority of 7,000-8,000 automatically suggest 4,000? “Majority” doesn’t mean “just over half”. \n\n&gt; The Srebrenica massacre took place in the month before Operation Storm, Croatia’s devastating attack and ethnic cleansing of some 250,000 Serbs from the Krajina, with over 1,000 civilians killed, including over 500 women and children—no women and children were bussed to safety by the perpetrators, as they were at Srebrenica—and more than 2,000 missing.\n\nOK, a few issues here. Firstly, yes many women and children (and men) were indeed “bussed to safety” by the Croatian Army in Operation Storm – but the more accurate term for this phenomenon, both in Storm and in Srebrenica, would be “deported” or “expelled”.\n\nSecondly, their source for their figures (which, as I said in my previous post on Srebrenica, are very high estimates): \n&gt; See, e.g., “Notification regarding anniversary of Serbs suffering in the aggression of Croatian army on the Serb Krajina in the August 95,” as posted to the Web site of the Veritas Documentation Information Center (last accessed June 23, 2007), http://www.veritas .org.yu. Veritas reports 1,883 ethnic Serbs killed during Operation Storm through the end of August, 1995. At tenth anniversary ceremonies in Belgrade, various survivor groups that represent former Krajina Serbs estimated as many as 2,627 Serbs had gone missing in the Krajina between 1991 and 1995. See “Patriarch Pavle holds memorial service for Serb victims of operation Oluja,” August 4, 2005, http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu.\n\nThese are both dead links now, but the bias of the sources is rather obvious from the titles – Croatia’s offensive against an unrecognised self-proclaimed rebel state on what was legally Croatian territory is referred to as “aggression”, for example. Even more significantly, the more than 2,000 missing that H-P refer to as being just from Operation Storm are in fact from *the whole four-year war*.\n\n&gt; It is likely that more civilians were killed in this campaign than following the fall of Srebrenica, but this was given cursory treatment by the Western media, and has never been regarded as a case of “genocide.”\n\nNo, it’s incredibly unlikely. The Bosnian Army reported as early as 4 August 1995 that less than 3,000 of the 6,000 troops which had been in Srebrenica had failed to make it to Bosnian government territory by that point. Therefore, at least 4,000-5,000 of a total of 7,000-8,000 who died were civilians.\n\nOn the overall numbers killed:\n&gt; In the first study, by Ewa Tabeau and Jakub Bijak, only some 55,000 deaths out of a total of 102,622 were found to have been civilians, including over 16,000 Serbs; the remaining 47,000 deaths were members of military groups.\n\nTheir reference for the 16,000 figure?\n&gt; Ewa Tabeau and Jakub Bijak, “War-related Deaths in the 1992–1995 Armed Conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” European Journal of Population 21, (June 2005):187–215; here 209; and n. 12, 213. These numbers are arrived at as follows: Tabeau and Bijak give 16,700 as their best “guesstimate” for Serb civilian deaths in the Bosnian wars (see their n. 12, 213).\n\nExcept if you actually check this article, you’ll find Tabeau and Bijak don’t say that at all. 16,700 is their estimate for civilian deaths on *Bosnian Serb Army-controlled territory*, which is a completely different question. In fact, the only time Tabeau and Bijak give estimates of civilian deaths by ethnicity is on page 204, where they give minimums – and here they give a minimum estimate of 2,130 Serb civilians dead in contrast to 22,225 Bosniaks, heavily suggesting the 16,000 and 31,000 respectively H-P claim they give as final estimates are not only misrepresentations, but very unlikely.\n\nIn addition, it’s quite interesting that they refer to Mirsad Tokaca’s comprehensive study in literally the next sentence. Tokaca’s figures for civilian deaths by ethnicity? [Roughly 33,000 Bosniaks, 4,100 Serbs and 2,200 Croats.] (http://www.rferl.org/content/Bosnian_Researcher_Counts_The_Dead_And_Faces_Threats_For_His_Objectivity/1350799.html) Wonder why they didn’t pick that to reference instead? And for the record, that 4,100 Serbs includes over 1,000 killed in the Siege of Sarajevo, i.e. mostly killed by the VRS.\n\n&gt; The hundreds of thousands of Serbs killed by the Independent State of Croatia’s Ustashe regime at Jasenovac and other prison camps during the Second World War—some estimates run to 600,000 —and the 16,000 Serb civilians killed in Bosnia 1992–95 are effectively disappeared, while the 31,000 Muslim civilians killed in the latter years are elevated to world class status as victims of genocide.\n\nInitially I thought I’d give them a pass on this one because it wasn’t clear whether they meant 600,000 dead at Jasenovac (far too high) or 600,000 Serbs killed overall by the Ustashe (probably slightly high, but close enough to be credible). But no, the reference makes it clear they do actually mean the former:\n\n&gt; According to The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, “Some six hundred thousand people were murdered at Jasenovac, mostly Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and opponents of the Ustasa regime” (740). Israel Gutman, ed. (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Publishing House, 1990), vol. 2, 739–40.\n\nHorrible and genocidal as Jasenovac was, the number who died there is not even close to 600,000. Both the [US Holocaust Memorial Museum Site](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005449) and the [Jasenovac memorial site](http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/Default.aspx?sid=7619) put the number at about 80,000-100,000.\n\nNow, Part 3. On the use of the charge of Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE) by ICTY:\n&gt; Of course it fits much better the joint Clinton, Blair, and NATO enterprises in Yugoslavia, or the Croats’ U.S.-supported ethnic cleansing of Serbs from the Krajina in August 1995. But there is nobody to enforce the JCE against them, whereas we have the ICTY to take care of U.S. and NATO targets!\n\nThe Croat leadership was charged with JCE actually, on two separate counts – Operation Storm and the Lasva Valley ethnic cleansing campaign – and was found guilty on the latter.\n\n\nLater in Part 3 they bring up a table of refugee figures and point out that Serbia was host to the most refugees and IDPs out of the former Yugoslav states. For some reason they regard this as evidence that Serbia was actually the main victim of the wars, though I don’t understand why – refugees run *from* war zones, not *to* them.\n\nNow, Part 4. On Samantha Power’s statements about the Bosnian War:\n&gt; Nowhere does Power contest the use of these emotionally laden words and images for the events of 1992. She doesn’t mention that the Bosnian Muslims and Croats also had such camps, which were of no interest to Western journalists, although there is no evidence that abuses there were not at least as great as those in Serb camps.\n\nTheir sole source for this is an article from a Serb nationalist site which does give graphic descriptions of atrocities at Celebici and other camps. But plenty of similar descriptions can be found for the Serb camps as well. What’s really comparable are numbers. While Celebici (generally considered the worst Bosniak-run camp) was a brutal place and it’s right that its commanders and guards were brought to trial, it pales in comparison to the Serb-run Omarska. About 10-15 died at Celebici, whereas Omarska’s death toll was well into the hundreds, at least.\n\n&gt; She also fails to mention that the key “image,” that of the emaciated Fikret Alic at Trnopolje, first circulated by the Independent Television Network on August 6, 1992, and which Power says “concentrated grassroots and elite attention and inflamed public outrage about the war like no postwar genocide,” was later revealed to have been staged. In fact, it was taken not at a “concentration” but a transit camp; Alic, the main subject of these images, had been suffering from a long-term illness when he was found, and was unrepresentative of the other prisoners who can be seen standing around him. Although at the moment the images were recorded, a barbed-wire fence physically was standing in between the camera and its subject, the barbed wire enclosed no one at the camp; instead, the angle from which the images were recorded conveyed the false impression that the subject was imprisoned behind barbed wire at an encampment—hence the full-page “Belsen 92” story on the cover of the August 7 Daily Mirror (London), and on the following week’s editions of Newsweek and Time (August 17), among hundreds like them. This monumental misrepresentation was a powerful propaganda instrument for the war-makers, but it was the misrepresentation of fact that concentrated attention, along with the deliberate allusions to Nazi Germany—not the circumstances at the camp. Years after its exposure, Samantha Power still fails to recognize that it was a fraud.\n\nNo, it was not “later revealed to have been staged” – LM, the magazine which alleged this and the source H-P reference, was later revealed in court to have been talking nonsense. Alic was indeed unrepresentative of the prisoners standing around him; not because he was suffering from illness, but because he had just arrived at Trnopolje from the far more brutal Keraterm camp.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and [here are](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Trnopolje_Camp.jpg) [some more](https://genocideinbosnia.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/trnopolje-concentration-camp-bosniak-bosnian-muslim-man-emaciated-bbc-tv-crew1.jpg) [pictures of Trnopolje prisoners](\nhttp://www.ronhaviv.com/data/photos/455_1highres_00012602.jpg). Are they all suffering from long-term illnesses?\n\n&gt; Actually, the death toll in Kosovo turned out to be low; perhaps when Power was writing her book, she still took as truth the hugely inflated estimates of her government (i.e., “from a low of 100,000…up to nearly 500,000”).\n\nTheir source for the 100,000-500,000 number that they claim the US was promoting as a death toll?\n&gt; See the entry for “Detentions,” in “Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo: Fact Sheet based on information from U.S. Government sources,” U.S. Department of State, April 19, 1999\n\nThis source was a nightmare to actually find, but [here’s]( http://www.phdn.org/archives/www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Ethnic_Cleansing10.htm) a copy. Turns out that 100,000-500,000 is actually the estimated number *missing*, not dead (a distinction H-P repeatedly appear - or just pretend - not to understand), and the context makes it quite clear that the State Department believed these Kosovans to be detained, not dead.\n\nOn the use of rape as a weapon of war:\n&gt; There is not a shred of evidence for the lower-end claim of 20,000 rapes.\n\nNow, I’m picking up on this example because I think it illustrates well H-P’s quite astonishing attitude to secondary sources. They dismiss with a single sentence a huge body of literature on this topic, such as Beverly Allen’s well-regarded *Rape Warfare* and Alexandra Stiglmayer’s *Mass Rape: The War against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina*. In its place, they quote things like this:\n&gt; For full accounts of this remarkable case of demonization and media willingness to report outlandish falsehoods, see Brock, Media Cleansing, 59–72; and Johnstone, Fools’ Crusade, 78–90.\n\nDiana Johnstone’s *Fools’ Crusade* is an at best, ‘controversial’, and at worst, incredibly badly-regarded book, and Johnstone, like Herman and Peterson, also denies the Srebrenica massacre. That said, at least it is *regarded*, having got some attention and been reviewed in a couple of academic journals, which is far more than Peter Brock’s *Media Cleansing* can manage. A google search turns up next to nothing apart from its page on Amazon, GoodReads and other sites which would come up for any book, no matter how obscure (I know the whole thing about judging a book by its cover, but seriously, google and check it – would you really regard a blurry cover that looks like its been done with WordArt as an academically authoritative one?). The few which aren’t include a review *by Herman* and a post about it on a Serb nationalist blog. It’s been published by what looks very much like a vanity press. I’m astonished how anyone could seriously reference this.\n\nOn a video tape showing the Serb nationalist paramilitary group ‘Scorpions’ killing Bosniaks:\n&gt; It is also revealing that comparable videotapes showing Bosnian Muslim or Croatian perpetrators of atrocities against Serbs exist but have drawn minimal attention, led to no broad generalizations, and were of little interest to the ICTY. The most notable are the tapes of killed and beheaded Serbs proudly shown by Naser Oric, the Bosnian Muslim commander at Srebrenica, to Western reporters while his forces still had their base there.\n\nBut we don’t have those tapes. H-P quote two articles from reporters who visited Oric and reported seeing the tapes, so it’s probably true that the tapes did exist at some point. But a brief report of someone who saw a tape is not the same as the tape itself.\n\nOK, now just a few notes on the glossary and timeline:\n\n&gt; Republika Srpska (or the Republic of the Serbs): On April 7, 1992, the Bosnian Serbs declared an independent state, with its capital in Banja Luka.\n\nNope, you’ll find Republika Srpska was actually declared three months earlier, on 9 January. H-P opt to move this to the day after Bosnia’s independence was recognised to portray Srpska as purely reactive rather than aggressive. Also, Srpska's wartime capital was Pale - it only moved to Banja Luka after the war.\n\n&gt; June 27, 1991: Krajina Serbs declare the existence of an independent Republic of Serb Krajina.\n\nNope, this time too early. The RSK won’t be proclaimed until December 1991.\n\nOK, I’m done. This is *far* from all the bad history in this piece (a lot of which is selectivity and omission), but hopefully I’ve covered most of the more blatant stuff. Hopefully more stuff of interest might come up in the comments.\n",

        "text": "So in this news article about North Korea developing hydrogen bomb...\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3znz01/north_korea_successfully_conducts_hydrogen_bomb/cynsgtm\n\nI don't think my review is that well written but this pisses me off and I want to get some facts straight. I know that I should expect such anti-American circlejerk from /r/worldnews and I don't necessarily agree much to American foreign policies as non-American but the sheer misinformation about the Korean War is just astounding. Same goes with basic understanding of geopolitics but I can't describe here because rules\n\n&gt;America could like stop threatening NK, apologize for genociding 30% of NKs civilians during the Korean war,\n\nFirst, the definition of genocide is “the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.” and that term is not really applicable when talking about war casualties in general. Also there was 9 million North Koreans at that time and about 500 thousand North Korean civilians died.\n\n&gt;North Korea invaded South Korea because SK dictatorship murdered 100,000 communists suspected communists and their families in SK in a purge. NK defeated the SK troops and would've taken SK.\n\nWhile purges against suspected communists and their families did happened, the purge before the Korean War (Jeju Uprising) had 14,000–30,000 were killed and the largest estimate is 80,000. Larger scale purge (Bodo League Massacre) also happened as well, but that happened DURING the Korean War. Most of all, that’s not why Kim Il-Sung started the war. It was mostly because of his pure ambition to spread communism and even Stalin was against this decision at first. NORTH KOREA was the aggressor.\n\n&gt;While America sided with the horror SK regime that was worse than the NK regime, AT THAT TIME. They did so because ideology rather than morality. They ignored the purge victims. They ignored NK valid complaints. \n\nAs I mentioned before, that’s not why they invaded, and North Korea NEVER made such complaints to US prior to invasion. Also they falsely claimed that the South had invaded first, and they’re continuing to make such claim to this day. Why would you deny you invaded first if they had such a noble cause? Also is he ignoring the fact that North Korea had similar purges as well? \n\n&gt;At first the Americans rolled over NK. In the process they exterminated NK civilians. They machine-gunned villages and used flame throwers on families from old people to women to little kids. Burned them alive. They genocided 30% of the population. They defeated the NK troops and went to the Chinese border.\n\n…Almost zero evidence of these happening, aside from North Korean propaganda. I guess he’s talking about Shinchon massacre, but US army did not stay long in Shinchon district for long as they had to rush to Pyongyang as fast as possible. Massacres did happened, but it was caused mostly by far-right militia, not the US army. North Korea claims that the massacre was ordered by an US commander named Harrison, but no written record of such commander exists in the first place. See above on genocide. Also he’s completely ignoring war crimes and massacres committed by North Korean side. \n\n&gt;China said you had stopped the NK invasion. Now go home or else we will step in. America laughed. \n\nAhh, those valiant Chinese guardians. Yes, they were against ‘US imperialism’ but they were more concerned about having a hostile government and US forces right underneath their industrial heartland in Manchuria. Also, by the same logic Russia should have stopped fighting with Russia after taking Stalingrad.\n\nBy the way, note that he’s ignorant of the fact that they were composed of UN multinational coalition forces, not just US.\n\n&gt;Then China rolled on the American troops and defeated them They rolled them back 1000 miles. That's the longest land retreat in American history. Huge American casualties in only a few weeks. The Chinese defeated the American troops in the American invasion of NK. This is fact. There was no American victory against China, only against NK, and that victory was reversed by the Chinese just as the Americans reversed the initial NK victory over SK.\n\nUmm… While the UN (not just America) troops were retreating at first, they eventually fought back with counterattack and pushed KVA and PLA forces back again to DMZ line. Operation Killer concluded with I Corps re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong. On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, taking back Seoul from KVA and PLA forces on 14 March 1951. Operations Courageous (23–28 March 1951) and Tomahawk (23 March 1951) succesfully trapped Chinese forces between Kaesong and Seoul. The Chinese responded to this by counterattacks in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive (also known as the Chinese Spring Offensive) and initially successful but they were eventually halted before they could come to Seoul again. At month's end, the U.S. Eighth Army counterattacked and regained \"Line Kansas\", just north of the 38th parallel, and after that it was just a stalemate. It was just literally it says. Both sides attacking and counterattacking without much real progress. Fighting continued until armistice was signed on 27th July 1953 and prisoners from both sides were exchanged. \n\n&gt;Claiming America won the Korean war is the same as saying NK won the Korean war. Both America and NK won and lost stages of the war. Neither attained their total objectives and the result between America and NK was a stalemate. The result from beginning of contact between the PLA and USA troops to end of contact was complete and total PLA victory. PLA defeated the USA troops, routed them decisively and returned the Americans to SK. The PLA would never have fought America, had America not invaded NK. America won the NK invasion of SK. China won the American invasion of NK.\n\nChina US didn't ‘win’, but China definitely did not win either. Both Chinese and North Korean troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, constant threat of UN bombers, and suffered much more casualties because of it. This also caused economic strain in their country which made Mao to consider withdrawal which Stalin recommended. As I mentioned, it was literally what it says. A stalemate. If they really won, they would've taken the whole Korean peninsula, you know. Technically two Koreas are technically still at war.\n\n&gt;The PLA would never have fought America, had America not invaded NK.\n\nYou know, North Korea was the initial aggressor. It’s obvious, but same thing could be said of Nazi Germany during WWII as well.\n\n&gt;China lost no territory at all. There was no fighting in China.\n\nBut they failed their objective. That’s like saying US won the Vietnam War because there was no fighting in US.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia \n\nChina Rising: A Study in Revolution\n\nKor",

        "text": "So I found this on Facebook, the hub of academic discourse, in which someone, quite seriously and not even with a hint of sarcasm, stated that nuclear weapons don't real. \n\n&gt;None of us have \"seen\" the Hiroshima bombing. It happened and then we were given a narrative about it from state and mainstream media sources. Upon closer examination, that story does not explain the data we have very well.\n\n&gt;Hiroshima was most likely firebombed in a manner similar to Tokyo. Same with Nagasaki. People began rebuilding right away and vegetation grew back right away, so there was no problem with radiation fallout. Claims about elevated rates of cancer in the area are inconclusive.\n\n&gt;Nuclear bombs are fake. Stop believing the lies and start believing the truth\n\nThis is quite obviously wrong even to someone who only knows the basics of WW2 and, y'know, the cold war that happened to be around *nuclear* weapons. But nah, all just a conspiracy. \n\nFirst of all, he seems to have a misunderstanding of how sources work. Just because we haven't “seen” [sic] the bombing ourselves, doesn't mean it's impossible to figure out a picture. Quite a few sources, including photos and videos (which are apparently fake. Pretty good fakes for 1945 if you ask me), show that the bombing happened. And what's more, there are countless testimonies from those on the ground who experienced the bombing and wouldn't be part of a supposed American government coverup of the existence of nukes, since, of course, Japan and America were kind of at war and wouldn't collaborate on these things. Unless they were somehow collaborating as it's all a huge conspiracy :o\n\nThe claim that it was just a big firebombing like in Tokyo is problematic in a fairly easy to debunk way: Japanese people at this point in the war had already experienced many firebombings themselves, and quite a few accounts from the ground noted that this bomb was different from what they had ever seen before, although a firestorm did indeed start afterwards:\n\n&gt;\"Hiroshima has been attacked by a new type of bomb. The city is in a state of near-total destruction.\" \n\nAnd\n\n&gt;\"When I took a sip of water at the fountain in the school ground I saw a flash. I felt something hot run through my body. The hair of a classmate who was nearby caught fire, and my hair and trousers also caught fire.\"\n\n[Source](http://www.asahi.com/hibakusha/english/shimen/happened/happened-01.html)\n\nThese accounts apparently don't exist to this gentleman, who stated in the thread:\n\n&gt;Listen guys, critical thinking is more than posting videos that confirm your bias. Can you provide any data, which is independently verifiable, which can confirm that there are nuclear bombs and they are real?\n\nThe answer to this is yes, as seen above, there are plenty of independently verifiable sources to corroborate that a nuclear weapon was dropped. From the government and people of a nation America was *at war with* at the time and have no reason to falsify this. \n\nMoving on. No problem with radiation you say? Well, according to a study cited by wikipedia (sorry, best source I had for this), “46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancer deaths among the bomb survivors were due to radiation from the bombs”, plus another study details heightened rates of brain malformation in survivors of the blast. \n\nAnd of course people would start rebuilding fairly soon, it was their damn homes and livelihoods that got blasted into oblivion.\n\nOur specimen continues:\n\n&gt;I think nuclear energy is probably real, but I think Chernobyl was probably a hoax. I have not done enough research on it yet to confirm. 3-mile island was also probably a hoax.\n\nChernobyl is the easiest one to debunk here. You can fairly easily head to the location yourself today and test the radiation with your very own geiger counter if you really wanted. The elephant's foot (the melted reactor core) is still there, ready for anyone to take a look if they don't mind dying slowly from the cancer afterwards. And, again, plenty of survivor accounts and cancer amongst the thousands of liquidators who worked to stop the radiation from leaking. Awfully high price to pay all to maintain the conspiracy that nuclear weapons don't exist. \n\nTo finish, our friend drops this little mind bender:\n\n&gt;If nukes actually existed, why would governments tell everybody? Why wouldn't they keep them secret? Why haven't they ever used them? Why haven't they tested them in decades?\n\nOK",

        "text": "It’s a compelling story….\n\nSkylab - America’s first Space Station, is launched in 1973. The first crew, led by the third man on the Moon, repairs damage caused during launch, saving the habitat for continued use. The second crew, led by the forth man on the moon, set new benchmarks for endurance and aptitude, surpassing their mission goals and schedule by 150%. \n\nAnd then the third crew - rookies all, who in a new and unfamiliar environment struggle to maintain the standards previously set, grow tired and grouchy at the demanding schedule set by an inflexible mission control. After six weeks of wrestling to make the schedule, and having little or no time for rest and recuperation, the crew finally snaps, complain bitterly over live broadcast, take an unscheduled day off and turn off the radio. \n\n“Fuckin’ A” I thought the first time I read this. Badass astronauts taking control of the tiller and doing it their way.\n\nI probably first read about it here http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/ringing-in-the-new-year-with-mutiny-in-orbit\n\n&gt; Long work periods and seemingly endless lists of tasks took their toll on the rookie astronauts. The crew found themselves exhausted, falling badly behind schedule. NASA was pushing them too hard, they said, and they couldn’t keep working such long hours. Ground crews in mission control disagreed. They felt that the astronauts were complaining needlessly, that they should be working through their meal times and rest days to catch up. It was expensive having a crew in orbit for 84 days, and NASA intended to get all the work out of the men it could manage. \n\n&gt;About six weeks into the flight, a few days before New Year's Eve, the Skylab 4 crew hit their breaking point. They announced an unscheduled day off, turned off the communications radio, and got some rest. They reportedly spent the day relaxing, taking in the stunning views of the Earth from orbit.\n\n&gt;Finally, at the end of December, Carr had a talk with Mission Control. Crews in orbit and on the ground eventually reached a compromise. Routine chores would be placed on a ”shopping list” and the crew could complete these items when they had time and felt up to it. Houston also agreed to leave the astronauts alone during meal times, designated rest periods, and in the evenings after dinner. \n\n&gt;The crew got their wish of a reduced workload, which in turn improved their performance, much to NASA's pleasure. But the coup came at a price: none of the astronauts ever flew again.\n\nOr I might have read it here https://libcom.org/history/1973-skylab-4-mutiny\n\n&gt;Six weeks into the mission, this culminated in the crew announcing an unscheduled day off, mutinying by turning off the communications radio while getting some rest.\nThey reportedly spent their day off relaxing and taking in the panoramic views of Earth from orbit.\n\nOr just Google \"Skylab 4\" and you get a wealth of references to a strike or mutiny...\n\nThe strike was the lede to Bill Pogue’s New York Times obituary http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/science/space/william-r-pogue-astronaut-who-flew-longest-skylab-mission-is-dead-at-84.html?_r=1\n\nand here..\n\nhttp://www.openthemagazine.com/article/true-life/on-strike-in-outer-space  \n\nhttp://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/5/5/1372730/-Skylab-and-the-Sit-Down-Strike-in-Space  \n\nhttp://www.psc-cuny.org/clarion/december-2013/labor-history-strike-outer-space  \n\nhttp://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/skylab-everything-you-need-to-know.html\n\nAnd right here on Reddit...\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1lx0cg/til_the_first_mutiny_in_space_occurred_in_1974\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1lwt3e/in_1973_the_skylab_crew_achieved_a_new_record_the\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2wp9lp/til_the_astronauts_aboard_skylab_4_went_on_strike\n\nThat last one has 571 comments, and way down the list, with 19 points and 0 children is [APGmonk](https://np.reddit.com/user/APGmonk)  https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2wp9lp/til_the_astronauts_aboard_skylab_4_went_on_strike/cotb709\n\n&gt; They didn't \"strike\". The second crew had built up to getting an extremely high amount of work done by the end of their mission, and the third crew (Skylab 4) were being scheduled to continue at that rate. Given that none of them had been in space before, and at least one of them suffered with space sickness for several days, there was no way they could achieve all the work they were being given.\nThe \"strike\" was due to all three crew members assuming the others were listening to Mission Control whilst they were working as fast as they could, thus there was no contact for a while. After discussing the matter with MC, the work schedule was changed, and they ended up completing all the work and more by the end of the mission.\n\n&gt;(Source: Homesteading Space - The Skylab Story)\n\n\nThis is correct. There was no strike in space.\n\nWritten with the astronauts, Homesteading Space is a comprehensive look at the Skylab program that does mention how annoyed they are that a Harvard Business School course misrepresented what happened with Commander Jerry Carr, Pilot Bill Pogue and Science Pilot Ed Gibson  as a bad management anecdote. \n\nHomesteading Space - page 357\n&gt;“In an effort to increase our efficiency,” said Gibson, “we occasionally would have only one of us listening to the voice traffic from the ground and responding to it while the other two of us turned off our radios and worked without interruption. We each signed up for an orbit as the radio-response guy. Well one day we made a mistake and for a whole orbit we all had our radios off!”\n\n&gt;“When we came up to over one of the sites,” said Carr, “the ground called us, and we didn’t answer them for a whole orbit. Regrettably that caused a lot of concern down on the ground. And of course the press just thought that was wonderful. They said, ‘Look at that. These testy, crabby old astronauts up there won’t even answer the radio now. They’ve turned it off and won’t listen to the ground anymore.’ We’ve had to live under that stigma they falsely created ever since.”\n\n&gt;“Problems that surfaced early in our mission were created by competent, well-intentioned people,” said Gibson. “The exceptions were the dramatic stories fabricated by the media and later repeated and exaggerated in a book on Skylab and a Harvard Business School study. There was no ‘strike in space’ by any stretch of the imagination. What could we threaten to do, go live on the moon? If any of these writers had gotten their information from just one of us, the crew or other people directly involved, responsible reporting and validity would have prevailed over expediency and sensationalism.”\n\n&gt;While finally taking a day off gave the crew a much-needed break and helped relieve some of the stress they were under, it didn’t really change the situation. “Right after our real day off,” Jerry Carr said, “we got right back onto the treadmill, and things weren’t getting any better. Finally after several weeks into the mission, it all came to a head. After dinner we always had a medical conference with the flight surgeon where we would tell him how we were doing physically, and we give him the readings for the food that we’d eaten and the water we’d drunk and all other data that they needed for their metabolic analysis. I said, ‘You know, I think we need to have a séance here.’ I told him about our situation, that we weren’t too terribly happy and that we were quite sure the ground wasn’t happy either. ‘It’s time for us to have a discussion, a frank discussion. We can do it on this channel if they want.’\n\n\n&gt;“That request went down to the doctors, they passed the word, and, when the press got a hold of it, they raised Cain. So Mission Control came back and said, ‘We’re going to have to do it on the open circuit.’ I said, ‘That’s fine.’\n\n&gt;“So one evening we started talking with ground as we came up over Goldstone [California]. We had the whole U.S. pass, essentially, for me to tell them all the things that were bothering us. ‘We need more time to rest. We need a schedule that’s not quite so packed. We don’t want to exercise after a meal. We need to get the pace of things under control.’ Then we said, ‘Okay, now, next pass over the U.S., you guys please tell us what your problems are.’\n\n\n&gt;“So during the next U.S. pass, they bent our ear with all of the things that we were doing, including our rigidity that made it difficult for them to have the flexibility to schedule us how they needed to. We came back with, ‘Let’s think about it overnight and try to come up with a solution by the morning.’\n\n&gt;“The next morning they sent a teletype message in which they recommended quite a few things. The most important one was to take all of the menial, routine housekeeping chores out of the schedule and put them on what we called a shopping list. They were things that needed to be done that day but not at any particular time. Of course, they still had to hard schedule those activities that were required at a specific time or location in orbit. By opening up the schedule that way, they really took the pressure off. We were no longer racing the clock to get things done. It solved the problem.\n\n&gt;“They also said, ‘We’re not going to hassle you anymore during meals or give you any major assignments after dinner. After dinner is relaxation time for you. Do a few things like some student experiments, but we’re not going to have any major experiments after dinner.’\n“We said ‘That sounds great. Let’s go with it!’ And it worked beautifully. It’s a testimony to the human condition. Henry Ford probably learned it on his assembly line. The line can only go so fast before you start making mistakes.”\n\n\nThis seems conclusive. The issues with scheduling were real, the crew complained, and they did negotiate a slightly more flexible schedule. But as far as turning the radio off? That would be drastic...\n\nThere were orbits and partial orbits when Skylab was out of contact with the ground.\nHere’s a gif of how, if required, they would maintain radio contact with Skylab as it flew over open ocean. http://www.gfycat.com/WarmheartedThreadbareAndeancondor\n\n\n\nThat’s a lot of Bozo the Clown looking planes flying around the world to maintain contact with a space station that won’t talk back to them. \n\nAt first I could care less about whether the story was fair…\n\nBut then this article happened - and it went all in on the strike in space.\n \nWhat Drives an Astronaut to Strike?  \n http://space.io9.com/what-drives-an-astronaut-to-go-on-strike-1732239226\n\n\n&gt;Six weeks into the mission, the crew broke: They declared an unscheduled day off, turned off their radios, and took the day to shower, stare out the windows, and relax.\n\n&gt;After the strike, Commander Carr renegotiated a work-schedule with ground control: “We need a schedule that is not so packed. We don’t want to exercise after a meal. We need to get things under control.” The crew were to be left alone during meals, and no strenuous work would be scheduled after 8 pm. Routine chores would be placed on a list for the astronauts to pick off at their convenience instead of on a rigid schedule. The truce had consequences: with more rest and higher morale, the astronauts were more productive. But they also were no longer trusted, and once the mission ended none of the trio ever flew again.\n\nIt was a new article, comments were ongoing, and I had an account. So I copied in the quote above from Homesteading Space and went on with my day.\n\nThe author replied! With a whole bunch of quotes of his own! The TL:DR of his reply was that the astronauts stories have shifted - from talking about having the day off to denial of the entire affair. \n\nIn all the ambiguity that author Mika McKinnon was fully aware of, he decided to print the legend - That six weeks into Skylab 4 mission (AKA Skylab 3 - don’t ask), over Christmas and New Year of 1973/74, the crew complained bitterly to Mission Control, took a day off, and then spent a day or so resolving their issues.\n\n**The internet is wrong. This will not stand.**\n\n\nIt is true that Carr, Gibson and Pogue never flew into space again. However, other than the Apollo-Soyuz mission in July 1975, NASA didn’t fly into space until the Space Shuttle in 1981. The Crew of Skylab 4 had spent 84 days in space. There were new astronaut classes in training. Carr, Gibson, and Pogue all resigned from NASA in the mid-seventies, when the agency was grounded for the rest of the decade. There were no missions to exclude them from.  \n\n\n“Strike in Space” as bad management anecdote comes from a Harvard Business case study. \n\nhttps://hbr.org/product/strike-in-space/481008-PDF-ENG\n\nI paid cash money for this 12 page report. It’s quite detailed in examining the lead up to the strike, but ends abruptly…\n\n&gt;“On December 27th, the end of the sixth week, the third crew went on the first strike in space. Carr, Gibson, and Pogue stopped working and spent a day doing exactly what they felt like doing. Carr made a declaration of independence to the ground…\n\n&gt;….When complaints and blistering language failed to get their message across, the astronauts turned off the radio and would not talk to ground control Houston.”  ^[citation ^needed]\n\nThere’s plenty of citations in the rest on the report, and this handy timeline gives us a few dates to go by…\n\n&gt;Dec. 27, 1973 Skylab declaration of independence\n\n&gt;Dec. 28, 1973 Sixth week in space for third crew\n\nThe most cited work by far in the report is “A House in Space” (1976) by Henry S.F. Cooper.\n\nCooper flat out says there was a strike. \n\n&gt;It wasn’t until the sixth or seventh week, halfway through the mission, that the situation improved, and it wasn’t because of any initiative on the ground but because the astronauts themselves revolted, and Carr, the commander, told the flight controllers, in a memorable bitch, that he had had enough. \n\n&gt;The third crew went on strike at the end of the sixth week. One day, Carr, Gibson, and Pogue stopped working and did exactly what they felt like doing. Gibson spent the day on the solar console, while Carr and Pogue sat in the wardroom looking out the window. Carr made a sort of declaration of independence to the ground. We’d all kind of hoped before the mission, and everybody had the message, that we did not plan to operate at the second crews pace, “He announced into the B-Channel. “And I think really up here my biggest concern is keeping the three of us up here alert and healthy.” \n\n&gt;(A House in Space. Page 129/130) \n\n\nInterestingly,  the copyright page of A House in Space states \n&gt; Most of this book originally appeared in a slightly different form in The New Yorker.\n\n“Slightly different”? How slightly different was the article in the New Yorker, a publication notorious for its rigorous fact checking, published in the same year as the book of the article?\n\n\n&gt;Not until the latter half of the mission did the situation improve, though, and then it wasn’t because of any initiative taken on the ground. It was because the astronauts themselves revolted, and Carr, the commander, told the flight controllers, that he had had enough. \n\n&gt;The third crew went on **a sort of sitdown strike** one day about half way through the mission.That day, Carr, Gibson, and Pogue stopped working and did exactly what they felt like doing. Gibson spent the day on the solar console, while Carr and Pogue sat in the wardroom looking out the window.”\n\n&gt;*Life in a Space Station* by Henry S.F. Cooper.  \n&gt;The New Yorker.

Could it be that the crew said “instead of working through our break, we’re going to take the rest we’re due, and which it’s agreed we can take”? \n\n\nThis strike in space story pisses the astronauts off somewhat. \n\nDavid Hitt, the author of Homesteading Space, is a redditor.. https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1lwt3e/in_1973_the_skylab_crew_achieved_a_new_record_the/cc3pky9\n \n\nAnd the Mercury 7’s NASA physician has a quick and thorough debunking…\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vZULLu4.jpg\n\nWilliam K.

Not helping matters is that the timelines in the \"strike in space\" articles, and Homesteading Space, are pretty vague. Which isn’t surprising, cause it didn’t happen.\n\n\nWe need primary sources… \n\nLike these! \n\nwww.scribd.com/collections/2867886/Skylab-Transcripts\n\n\nSome maniac uploaded transcriptions from all three Skylab Missions.\n\nThere’s the onboard voice transcriptions,  \nthe Air to Ground transcriptions,  \nthe Voice Dumps - *(Where the crew recorded longer messages which were then transmitted at high speed to the ground)*  \nand Public Affairs Office (PAO) Mission commentaries, *(comm channels the press listened on with added commentary by NASA officials._* \n\nThe one thing thats not in dispute is that this action occurred at the half way point of the mission, which was December 28, 1973, at the end of the sixth week and into the seventh.\n\nIf a mutiny, or strike, or unscheduled day off, occurred, I think that at some point acronym happy NASA will be saying “WTF Skylab?” And that there would be reprimands, as had occurred following some unauthorised puking at the beginning of the mission. \n\nThe following chronology is mostly taken from Skylab 4 PAO mission Commentaries 14 - 16 of 32.\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/49157130/Skylab-4-PAO-Mission-Commentary-14-of-32  \nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/49157250/Skylab-4-PAO-Mission-Commentary-15-of-32  \nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/49157335/Skylab-4-PAO-Mission-Commentary-16-of-32  \n\n\nbut I have cross checked with the Air to ground\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/49152651/Skylab-1-4-Technical-Air-To-Ground-Voice-Transcription-Vol-4-of-7 \n\nand Voice Dump transcripts,,\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/49337579/Skylab-4-Voice-Dump-Transcription-6-of-13\n\n\n**Christmas Day 1973.** \n\nCarr and Pogue suit up for a spacewalk. During this Skylab was out of radio contact for an orbit. This was expected and normal due to the layout of tracking stations. \n\nThe Christmas EVA lasted for 7 hours and I suppose you could technically argue that Carr and Pogue spent the day staring out the window of their helmet visors as they photographed the comet Kohoutek, but I don’t think that’s a mutiny. \n\nAs the spacewalk went 90 mins over time, housekeeping chores for the evening were cancelled.\n\nThe PAO Mission commentary reports\n&gt;Commander Carr having pork loin, tomatoes and shrimp and strawberries. Science Pilot\nGibson having prime ribs of beef, greenbeans, pears and rolls, while Pilot Pogue has filet mignon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and orange drink. They will top this off with some extra fruit cake left behind by previous crews.\n\nCarr gives his evening status report. \n\nFood eaten, Sleep times, equipment malfunctions…. \n\n…and Flight Plan Deviations : None. \n\nAlso they can't  find the Christmas presents hidden in the storage lockers. \n\nThe PAO reports that…\n\n&gt;Tomorrow will be *a day off* for the crew of Skylab IV. They’ll sleep in late. Wake-up time 8a.m. Central Standard Time tomorrow December 26th, Wednesday. 3 hours of ATM observations tomorrow for the crew, and generally, a day off for three Skylab crew members on tomorrow, their 41st day in orbit.\n\n**26 December.** \n\nThis is their day off. \n\nNow if you want to argue “a sit-down strike of sorts”. This is where it happened. The astronauts availed of their scheduled day off, and rested the day after setting a new EVA record. \n\nMission Control delayed the wake up call by 30 mins, those slave drivers. \n\nRadio still working. There’s chit chat about the spacewalk and a press conference. The scientists are very pleased with the results from the observations of the comet. Pilot Ed Gibson is scheduled to photograph volcanos on the Galapagos Islands. \n\nThey also discuss the exercise time they’re getting. They want more but the schedule is getting in the way..\n\nAt 17:06 CST the Public Affairs Office reports \n\n&gt;Pilot Pogue in his 4 hour block of off-duty time, either reading, listening to music, throwing darts or possibly even sleeping. Science Pilot Gibson performing his daily exercise period while Commander Gerald Carr should be concluding his weekly hot shower aboard the workshop.\n\nThis is the day they spent time staring out the window and doing what they wanted. Because that was the plan for the day.\n\nWith equipment checks and monitoring of life support on the ship even on a rest day, deliberately turning off the radio would be a really stupid thing to do. \n\nThat evening Carr’s status report reported a Flight Plan Deviation: “the SPT’s, HK7J and the DC9 have been delayed. We’ll get them later this evening. “\n\nI have no idea what this means. Were they delayed due to an unscheduled mutiny? Nobody seems to bothered if they were. But cap-comm are bothered by the commander's deviation in water intake by one and a half ounces. \n\nThe crew also confirm their wives hugged cap-comm for Christmas. Gibson is perturbed, he gave no such authorisation.\n \nAt the end of the day the Public Affairs Office reports\n\n&gt;“The crew will awake tomorrow, Thursday, December 27th at 6a.m. central standard time, to a busy day, most of which will be devoted to manned observations of the Sun. Nearly 1/3 of the 23 science collecting hours scheduled for tomorrow are to be devoted to the Sun. Pilot Bill Pogue and Science Pilot Ed Gibson are again subjects of a pair of medical experiments, designed to assess the cardiovascular heart and circulatory systems of the astronauts as well as measure their ability to perform fixed workloads on a bicycle ergometer. The crew also has the opportunity tomorrow to take photos out the wardroom window of more than a half of dozen ground targets, including drought areas in Mall, ocean currents throughout the world and the Afar triangle, in east Africa, to aid in better understanding continental drift processes. The crew had a relaxing day. The crew health status is excellent….”\n\n&gt;(Page 2)\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/49157250/Skylab-4-PAO-Mission-Commentary-15-of-32\n\n\nThe next day this is exactly what happened.\n\n**Thursday the 27th of December 1973**\n\nThe day begins, however, with the negotiation that their next day off, New Years Day, be pushed to the 2nd January to allow photographing and mapping the African continent as they pass overhead. They agree to push the rest day to 2nd January.\n\nAlso, they can’t find the urine sample bags.\n\nFlight Plan Deviation: None\n\nThen there’s this…. on 27th Dec 1973 at  21:40 C.S.T.\n\nCC is cap-comm. CDR is Commander Jerry Carr.\n\n&gt;CC Skylab, Houston, we’re AOS Carnarvon and Honeysuckle. And we got you for about 9minutes.\n\n&gt;CDR Roger, Dick. Hey Dick, how much longer you guys are going to be on tonight?\n\n&gt;CC Oh, oh, we’re, we’re going to be around here till about midnight. We - your last pass of the evening is the next which is Guam.\n\n&gt;CDR Okay, I’m working up a little special message for you and Phil. It’ll be going on tape probably in the next 15 or 20 minutes.\n\n&gt;CC Oh my goodness, okay, we’ll certainly be looking for it.\n\nThis special message was recorded and down loaded in the Voice Dumps. Carr’s “memorable bitch”\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2FRJRXc.jpg\n\npage 60\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/49157250/Skylab-4-PAO-Mission-Commentary-15-of-32\n\nI’d also like to point out, at the supposed height of tension between the crew of Skylab 4 and Mission control. This happened…\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/B0HvsNg.jpg\n\n**December 28th** \n\nThe crew have a live comms chat with Astronomer Lubos Kohoutek of the Comet Kohoutek.  Outside the schedule Gibson photographs brush fires in Argentina, and they are asked to observe a cyclone east of Madagascar. And then this response to complaints.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/20uGpWS.jpg\n\nAt 19:00 CST the relay station in Tenerife couldn’t acquire a signal to the space station. Nonetheless...\n\n28th Dec status report - Flight Plan Deviation - None.\n\nOkay… by now it should be clear we haven't had a breakdown in communication between 25 to 28 December right? So those dates are out. How about the next day? It had been three whole days since their last rest day.\n\nOn **29th December 1973** they were SPACEWALKING. \n\nand at the end of that day…\n\n Flight Plan Deviation - None.\n\nThat’s the ludicrous thing about this. That they would spend a day ignoring Mission Control between two spacewalks in close succession. If they did anything of the sort, it’s a cover up of Moon Landing proportions.\n\nAnd that’s where the nub is. That ornery astronauts would stick to the bosses and take the day off makes a better story. More relatable to us plebs in cubicles not circling the earth at 17,00 miles an hour. A better story for a New Yorker article, for the book of the article (the truth stretched a little farther), for a glib management anecdote in business school, or for a sensationalist web post four decades after.  \n\nInstead they spent the evening of **Dec 30th** resolving their differences like grown ups. \n\nPages 101 to 112\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/49157335/Skylab-4-PAO-Mission-Commentary-16-of-32\n\n\nAnd after that clearing of the air Commander Carr of Skylab 4 gave his evening status report… \n\nFlight Plan Deviation : None. \n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n\n\nShout out to David Hitt, co-author of Homesteading Space, for his help with sources.

They just got off their camels and into their Ferrari's 30 years ago.\n\n&gt; You're supporting the wrong people, America!\n\nSo, \"civilization\" (as in complex societies) in the general region of Iran is actually significantly older than 3000 years if we factor in Elam and such. But if we decide that Persian civilization begins with the conquests of Cyrus the Great then Persia would indeed be around 2600 years old.\n\nHowever, the rest of the Middle East is....\n\n* Iraq: Civilization in the general region of Iraq is very, very old. It is the birthplace of Sumer, after all. But it's hard to say that cultures like Sumer were \"Iraqi\" except in a geographic sense, despite what the Saddamite Iraqi anthem used to say, and all in all the idea of a distinct Iraqi nation isn't as old as the idea of an Iranian one. That doesn't mean Iraq is \"barely civilized.\" But anyways the area of Iraq has been a hotbed of intellectual development since literally thousands of years ago, and it was generally an urbanized area to varying degrees, not a desert of camel-riders.\n\n* Levant: Civilization here is also very, very old, what with the Eblaite kingdom and such. Again, it's hard to speak of a Lebanese/Syrian/Palestinian/Jordanian \"nation\" until recently, again it doesn't mean the peoples of those countries are \"barely civilized,\" and again, it has been a major hotbed of intellectual development with an urban population. Roman Antioch had a population in the hundreds of thousands, for example. \n\n* Egypt: I think it is fairer to establish continuity between Ancient Egypt and modern Egypt, actually, and the concept of an Egypt, even an Arabic-speaking one, is also older than the concept of a Syria or an Iraq. Anyways again a center of development, not \"camels &gt; ferraris.\"\n\n* Arabia: Contrary to popular thought, Arabia has been home to major kingdoms, from Oman to the Hejaz. The concept of an Oman is fairly old, for example, and you can't exactly call the Omanese maritime empire from Tanzania to Pakistan \"camel riders.\" Yemen has also had major civilizations, characterized by the Queen of Sheba. The Hejaz was also a commercial center. And so on...",

They did not succeed in the execution of a single one of their core goals. Judaism has survived their hate, and flourished in Israel and across Europe. Communists ruled half of Germany for half a century, and although they were discredited in their own right, the left is a vibrant political force in modern Germany. Homosexuals, though their persecution did not end in 1945, are now a public and accepted part of German life. Land was lost in the East, not gained, and the supposedly thousand year Reich lasted but a bare twelve. \n\nNazism exists as an almost anachronistic spasm of rage. They were effective only at destruction, culminating with the destruction of themselves and Germany. The claim otherwise, that the Nazi state was a juggernaut of amoral strength, is itself a somewhat bizarre blending of tropes. Somewhere between a felt need to justify personal interest in an admittedly interesting man (Adolf Hitler), and the ever popular second-option bias, my suspicion is that the stereotype of Nazism as a ruthlessly efficient system is related to the broader conception of the Nazi state as “a mighty machine, manned by countless nameless, faceless bureaucrats and soldiers who were no more than cogs in the apparatus, obediently and unthinkingly doing whatever they were told, without much conviction of their own, except loyalty to the system.” Conceiving of Nazism as the product of psychopaths and automatons does not excuse the responsibility of perpetrators, but it does ease our own burden of self-examination. Because we are troubled by what Nazism stood for, because we have no evil intent, because we are not fanatics, or thoughtless in our action, the crimes of Nazism are entirely foreign to our being. They adopt the character of something which, because it happened in the past, is similarly confined to the past. The “mighty machine” of Nazism places both actions and motives safely in the past, outside of our own self-reflection.\n\n\nHowever, Nazism was neither a machine nor particularly effective in ideology or government. \n\n\n**Part 1: Racial ideology**\n\n\nThe hallmark of Nazism was their effort to build and sustain a racially pure state. They held the protection of the Volksgemeinschaft [people’s community] as their reason for existence. The fundamental characteristic of Nazism’s racial ideology is a belief in the intrinsic difference and superiority of Aryan ‘Germanness,’ and their ideology of blood and soil held that the German people were mystically bound to the land which they occupied. Blood and soil, land and people, each facet gained strength from the other in turn. To this end, programs like the Hitler Youth and League of German Girls placed young Germans in field and labor camps as a part of a program of ideological indoctrination. In 1933 the State Hereditary Farming Law made explicit the association between the strength of the people and their land by seeking to “preserve the farming community as the blood-source of the German people.” These beliefs were also the basic cause for Nazi expansion eastward. Lebensraum was the rallying call for war against Poland and the Soviet Union, bound together with the concept of racial, ideological struggle against welt jüdischer Bolschwismus. Their vision was of a new future of expansionary German settlement, where hardy farmer-pioneers pushed the frontier ever eastward in service of their race.\n\n\nIt should hardly need to be said, but the Nazis were not effective in realizing this vision. Those few Germans who did colonize new lands during the period of 1941-44 were expelled when the armies of the Soviet Union rolled back the tide. In 1939, there were 2.1 million ethnic Germans in East Prussia. By 1945 there were only a few hundred thousands. In 1939 Germany controlled land to the East of the Oder. In 1945 they did not. And for all of this, the Nazis sacrificed some seven million of their supposedly precious specimens of good, Aryan stock. Adolf Hitler and his Nazi state sought war with the explicit goal of conquering and subjugating their targets for the benefit of a new, ethnically German, racial order. They lost, Germany lost, and millions of Germans were killed in the losing. They were effective only in failure.\n\n\nFurthermore, even a cursory examination shows that the foundational tenets of ‘Aryan,’ ‘German’ or even blood were ill-defined and contradictory. Leaving aside the expansionary facet of Nazism’s racism, even a purely internal purifying effort was doomed to failure. Alon Confino writes that “there were two kinds of science in the Third Reich, connected but not identical.” There was that with which we are familiar, where experiments and hypothesis are created and tested in the spirit of honest inquiry, and then there was the other sort which “sought to prove Nazi racial ideas, conforming to its ideological imperatives. Racial experts read into the ‘evidence’ what they had already determined before their research had begun.” Consequently, the boundaries of race were defined more often as markers of spiritual belief, or as “a community of intellect,” than by any evidentiary basis. Even by their own standards, the Nazis were not effective in creating a racially pure society because within their own standards were housed fatal and irreconcilable contradictions. Nazi racial ideology could not be effective because it was basically nonsensical. \n\n\nThe failure is shown in the Nuremberg race laws, which were Nazism’s most visible attempt to codify their dogma. The basic demarcation was that anyone who had three of four Jewish grandparents was themselves considered a Jew, but in implementation fringe cases abounded. For example, a child born before 1935 to a union between a Jew and a German was classified as Mischling [partly belonging to the German race] whereas a child born to the same union after 1935 was considered fully Jewish. Such a contradiction is an inherent consequence of trying to translate an ideology with a basically false premise (that Jews are readily definable and separable from German society) to practical application.\n\n\nAfter all, why should a convert to Judaism be marked for death when the German wife of a Jewish man was not? In the language of blood, as the Nazis used it, both would be equally fouled. But, because of the inherent contradictions in Nazi ideology, they were treated differently. Doris Bergen writes of another example originating in Poland, where bureaucrats were tasked with the “Germanization” of the newly acquired territories. “They realized that even a massively increased birthrate could not produce enough children to achieve the rate of population growth they wanted. As a result they proposed taking “racially valuable” children away from supposedly inferior parents in order to “Germanize” them.” However, if the value of race is tied to blood there would be little sense in hoping the child of an inferior soul could produce a superior soul. Unless the racial value of an individual is in some way separate from their blood, in which case a program of integration is comprehensible. The inefficiency of Nazi racial ideology was that they, in separate arenas and at the same time, argued for both. \n\n\nA particular example can be found in the case of two Polish women named Johanna and Danuta W. Their parents were “pure Polish,” but the sisters nevertheless applied for Germanization. “In 1944 SS racial authorities in one city approved Johanna’s application and she became officially recognized as an ethnic German. A similar office elsewhere rejected Danuta. Meanwhile both women went to Germany to work as housemaids.” While there Danuta would become pregnant by an SS man and when her “baby was born he received ethnic German status, but his mother was still classified as a Pole.” The reason given for this byzantine demarcation: Danuta “did not look so good.” \n\n\nAnother similar story is related by Alon Confino. In a bizarre twist of fate, the ghettoization of German Jews markedly increased the status of Jewish archivists. Because ‘Germanness’ and ‘Aryan’ were never defined by anything other than what they weren’t, anyone seeking to prove Aryan ancestry would have to prove first that they weren’t Jewish. One SS man by the name of Kuh set out to prove his pedigree through consultation with the local archivist Rabbi Brilling in Breslau, but encountered the problem that his great-grandmother had converted to Christianity from Judaism in 1802. The cutoff date for such a conversion to be acceptable was 1800. Kuh, “considering his exciting future career and in appreciation of the good work of the archivist, asked Brilling to change the date [of conversion] to 1798.\" So doing, he mystically changed his soul, his blood, his very essence from being unacceptable to acceptable. The difference two years makes. \n\n\nThe rank weakness of Nazi ideology was that they never managed to produce a cohesive, consistent definition of that which they purported to cherish and defend. Aryan and German were left simply as the anti-thesis of that which Nazism hated. A German was not liberal. A German was not Jewish. A German was not Communist. A German was not disabled. A German was not overly religious. A German was not decadent. What a German was not was well known. Less clear was what a German was. And, despite the huge amount of effort expended in the annihilation of those who they hated, Nazism was aiming at a phantasm of “racial purity” and they never managed to hit it. Nor could they, because it doesn’t exist. Fantasy does not for effective policy make. \n",

        "text": "http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004037865/recommended/279140/\n\nh-h-h-h-here we go.\n\n&gt; 1. Allied forces are HEAVILY favored. What do I mean by that? Simple, all the units on the different sides of the conflict are equivalent. A German infantry is equal to that of a French or Russian infantry. The German military was the best trained, the best equipped, and the best supported army in the conflict. Some would even put this military on par with the greatest militaries of all time. Russia, on the other hand, was supposed to be slow to mobilize and ill-equipped. I played a game where AI Russia was in Berlin before the end of 1914. Because the units are equal in strength, the Allies, with huge size advantages, will likely always win.\n\nYes. You read that right. \"Allied forces are HEAVILY favored\" you say? So they're overpowered? They have unfair advantages? No, even by his own words, \"they are equivalent.\" Because Prussia isn't overpowered, it's unfair. Holy shmoly. \n\nAnyways, the German military was *not* the best trained. In fact, out of all the powers, military observers noted their distinct lack of adaptation to modern conflict. Charles Repington, military correspondent to *The Times*, in October 1911, concluded *\"No other modern army displays such profound contempt for the effect of modern fire.\"* The British, in contrast, were the precise opposite. The 1911 manual on infantry training stressed defense and security. Fire, maneuver, and cooperation between all facets of firepower were necessary. To quote Herwig directly, *\"The days of swarming lines of infantry, solid massed columns advancing, and inspired bayonet charges with trumpets blaring and colors flying belonged to the past.\"* Cavalry doctrine emphasized that the soldiers dismounting and using their rifles was their primary mode of attack and direct fire coordinated with fire &amp; maneuver tactics dominated the dogma of infantry attacks.\n\nFor more detail, see [this post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3z5x6z/z/cyjnagm)\n\nThey were also hardly the best equipped. The French 75mm flat firing artillery pieces fired 2-3x as fast as the German 77mm counterpart and, unlike the German heavy guns, did not need massive rail transport just to move them to the next battleground. Electronic communications was yet another area of massive neglect. While the French and British used it extensively, Schlieffen and Moltke were content to conduct maneuvers both in simulations and in the real deal by literally riding horses to hand deliver hand written detailed plans. In fact, messenger birds would make up the bulk of the German communication department, not modern radio or even telegraph. \n\nBut just from a purely snarky standpoint, yeah, the Germans were the best trained and best equipped and overall best army in the world. Guess that's why they won instantly in the Marne against those inferior French in 1914. Oh wait. Or why in 1916, with the cards on the table, they decisively crushed the French at Verdun and repelled the British counter attack at the Somme and then sued for a negotiated peace. Oh. Wait. Or why they were the first develop squad level infiltration tactics and small unit doctrine. Oh wait, that was the French in 1915 and the Russians in 1916. Or that's why they were the first to implement unit and platoon level tactical doctrine army-wide designed for the modern battlefield. Oh wait, that was the British in 1917. \n\nAlso, \"the Allies, with huge size advantages, will likely always win\"\n\nYOU MEAN THE GERMANS STARTED A WAR BEING ENCIRCLED BY GREATER POWERS AND LOST? WOA\n\n&gt; 2. Serbia is too weak. Historically, Serbia lasted a surprisingly long time. In this game, Serbia doesn't have even close to enough resources to supply its comparatively huge military. Austria-Hungary rolls them up as a matter of course, because the Serbians starve to death and run out of guns.\n\nI mean yeah the Serbians lasted an impressively long time but it was a fluke. They *were* outnumbered. They *did* rapidly run out of supplies of all types. Their defeat *was* inevitable. \n\n&gt; 3. Belgium is too strong. I played a game where Belgium completely repelled Germany (one of the greatest militaries in history), and even took ground in Germany. \n\nWell the Belgians kind of did hold off the Germans at Liege for quite a while, throwing a huge wrench in all their plans. Now maybe they are a tad overpowered but then again his reasoning is obviously not in nuanced game balance but WHY ISN'T GERMANY THE GREATEST MILITARY EVAR?!?!?\n\n&gt; 4. The Allied forces start with Great Britain already involved. GB wasn't keen on getting in on this war, and only planned on doing so if Belgium's neutrality was violated. GB also only had the expeditionary forces on hand to wage a land war, in this game they seem to have a pretty healthy army from the start.\n\nTo quote directly from Holger Herwig,\n\n*This they did -- in 1906, 1907, and 1908. Under Grierson's successor, Wilson, the plans matured into the dispatch of a BEF consisting of four infantry division and one cavalry division -- to be augmented by an additional two infantry divisions once the Territorial Forces were deemed fit to stand up an effective home defense. The BEF was to deploy on the left wing of the French army near Le Cateau-Maubeuge-Hirson. While Wilson viewed its five divisions as \"fifty too few\", he nevertheless set the wheels in motion for a formal British \"continental commitment.\"*\n\n. . .\n\n*The army-navy antagonism over strategy came to a head on 23 August 1911 at a critical meeting of a subcomittee of the Committee of Imperial Defense . . .\"Continental intervention\", in the words of historian Samuel R. Williamson Jr., \"had become the accepted dogma.\"*\n\nFurther, he drastically underestimates how many men the British had. So a short tl;dr of how the British system worked of deployment. They had 'regulars' and 'territorials'. This seems self explanatory. Each 'regular' battalion would send half overseas to occupy the colonies while the other half stayed in Great Britain for rest, training, cycling back and forth, etc. So Britain had 150,000 'regulars' immediately go to France on the outset of the war. They had another ~150,000 coming in from all over the world, boosting their force up to 300,000ish. They also had 14 Territorial divisions consisting of another 300,000 men. Considering Britain's size, 600,000 men is nothing to scoff at for a peacetime army. This is especially true considering the Germans and French had peacetime armies of 884,000 and 880,000 respectively. \n\n&gt; 5. Austria-Hungary is too good. The Great War is the tale about how Austria-Hungary constantly did the exact opposite of what Germany wanted, and as a result, they were getting pummelled by everyone, including the Kingdom of Serbia. The only force AH knows how to fight is Italy, which leads to the next point:\n\nI'm not too well versed on Austria-Hungary but he is vastly overstating how poorly they fought. Though again he never specifies what \"too good\" means. \"Not instantly the worst power in existence in comparison to glorious Prussia\" or \"survives for more than a year\" or \"wins the game outright through glorious Hungarian nationalism\"? As he says himself, the Austrians *pummeled* the Italians and gave the Russians a piece of their mind too. They were a disaster, certainly, but they still held their own and played a crucial part in holding up millions of Russian and Italian forces who otherwise would have been able to hit Germany harder. \n\n&gt; 6. Italy is too strong. Historically, Italy failed to take the exact same river 9+ times against Austria. In this game, it's only a little harder than taking any other position. \n\nI'm *really* not getting this here. So AH is too good but at the same time Italy easily overcomes Austria's defenses and overwhelms historically well defended positions? What?\n\n&gt; 1. The Great War was insane. Battles went no where, and the defenders always had the advantage.\n\nUgh. [Here's a good post on this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/3s5n32/wwi_combat_footage_including_soldiers_suffering/cww6lq3) [Here's an even better post on this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2vgopo/why_did_trench_warfare_stop_after_ww1/)\n\n&gt; Hence, both sides would put up trenches, and fortify, fortify, fortify. Attacks were suicidal. \n\nSee above. \n\n&gt; This game doesn't do trench warfare well because the units and regions are too large. \n\nSo, like history, strides made against enemy defenses must be massive multi-division sized operations that involve many months and millions of men? Like it needs to be *an offensive*?\n\n&gt; These trenches were separated by only a few hundred yards, loaded with barbed wire, and supervised by machine guns and artillery. Units would stand at a stalemate for months at a time, with no progress being made, constantly under a hail of shells. In this game, you have to commit massive armies to an attack, and the attack lasts until one side loses. Smaller units or smaller regions would help solve this issue.\n\n...So, again, like real life? An attack lasts until one side loses? WOAH!\n\n&gt; 2. You can always see all the units of the enemy. Observation planes and observation balloons only give your artillery bonuses to hit (which they need, because they can barely ever hit). This is not a good feature for a game where air superiority meant you knew where your enemey was, and they didn't know where you were.\n\nWe're kind of breaking off from history here but you can tell that this guy has zero academic experience with this war. Yes artillery barely ever hits without spotting, usually from planes or balloons. Handheld radios didn't really exist yet. You need spotters to hit shit with indirect fire, that is, not being able to directly see your target. \n\nUgh whatever. Sources are in both of my links above.",

        "text": "An early front runner for worst history by an head of state in 2016 emerged today, Recep Erdoğan:\n\n&gt;Asked on his return from a visit to Saudi Arabia whether an executive presidential system was possible while maintaining the unitary structure of the state, he said: “There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler’s Germany. \n\n&gt;Source:[Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/01/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-hitlers-germany-example-effective-government)\n\nSo there are two ways to respond, one involves a detailed discussion of the interplay between Nazi ideology and corruption, the ideological aims of their movement and that they failed even by their own standards. Alas, this would require me to look into sources, and the year started pleasantly enough so that I do not want to read anything written by Hitler before January 2nd. So I just take the realpolitik point of view, a system that looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Royal_Air_Force_Bomber_Command%2C_1942-1945._CL3400.jpg) after a few years can hardly be called feasible.  \n\n[**Edit:**] Some people claim that Erdogan was misquoted. I don't speak Turkish, so I can not check the video for myself, but I  found the quote in a [spiegel.de artcicle](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/tuerkei-recep-tayyip-erdogan-nennt-hitler-deutschland-als-beispiel-fuer-praesidialsystem-a-1070162.html) (German), and then looked for an English language source, the Guardian source above. However the two articles read very similar so I would assume that they are basically a translation of the same source. At that point I wondered if I need a disclaimer, until I found a faz.net article [\n„Falsch interpretiert“- Präsidialamt relativiert Erdogans Hitler-Vergleich ](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/falsch-interpretiert-praesidialamt-relativiert-erdogans-hitler-vergleich-13993460.html) (German, title is &gt;&gt;\"Wrong interpretation\" - Office of the president clarifies Erdogan's Hitler comparison&lt;&lt;), which attributes the above quote to Erdogan and claims that Turkish officials clarified later that Erdogan was misquoted. In addition I just checked the New York Times, [who also attribute the quote directly to Erdogan](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/02/world/europe/turkeys-erdogan-seeking-a-more-powerful-presidency-cites-hitlers-system.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0): \n\n&gt; Mr. Erdogan, who is pushing to imbue the largely ceremonial presidency with sweeping executive powers, told reporters late Thursday that “there are already examples in the world.”\n\n&gt; “You can see it when you look at Hitler’s Germany,” he said.\n\nand go on and discuss the charges of misquoting Erdogan. So at this point I believe that I have three independent sources, two of them, the NYT and the FAZ, do not feel the need to qualify the attribution of the quote to Erdogan, even though it is in a context where they report on some dispute.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3y33r8/the_christmas_truce_of_world_war_i_an_exercise_in/",
        "text": "101 years ago, soldiers from the opposing sides arose from their trenches and briefly met in No Mans' Land of France and Belgium, and for a century afterwards, sentimental bloggers have gushed about how stories like this restore their \"[faith in humanity](http://faithinmankind.tumblr.com/post/34467754805)\" and [illustrated it with images that most likely aren't even pictures from the truce.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1nzee9/the_goddamn_christmas_truce_and_the_headache_it) Well, here I am to once again be a bit of a grinch.\n\nThe Christmas Truce is perhaps one of the more misunderstood occurrence of World War I. It is quite a popular theme to bring up as an example of man’s common humanity bridging the gap during war, and the subject of notable popular portrayals, such as last year's charming [Sainsbury’s ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWF2JBb1bvM), or the 2006 movie “Joyeux Noel”. But despite this, actual scholarship regarding the truce is surprisingly sparse, and notable controversies surround the event in academic circles. \n\nContrary to the popular impression, the Christmas Truce was not a universal occurrence on the front, and if anything, the popular image of foes cavorting in “No Man’s Land”, and even playing soccer, are to be chalked up as the exception, rather than the rule, especially outside of the British sectors. Although a few reports of fraternization prior to the holiday season exist, the Truce was a rather spontaneous act, certainly with no pre-planning from higher up, and as such, some units were eager to put aside the fighting for a day, while others were not. The French and Belgians, perhaps to be expected, were generally not eager to fraternize with the enemy (the French Foreign Legion specifically, less so), while it was more widespread in British sectors (but certainly not all of them. Roughly 2/3 participated to some degree). On the German side, Saxon and Bavarian units proved to be the most \"easy going\" and likely to participate, compared to the Prussian units especially. It happened on the Eastern Front as well (even though Orthodox Christmas was later), and apparently only the Serbs showed zero interest in paling with the enemy for a few hours, as there are no accounts of any sort of ceasefire occurring in the region.\n\nArrangements for the Truce came about rather informally. In the case of The Scots Guards, they reported that a scout went out late on Christmas Eve and met a German patrol, where they traded a few goodies, and agreed to a ceasefire for the morning. And however it started, almost every account reports that it was the Germans who pushed for the Truce, some apparently through the singing of carols on the night of the 24th that is almost always used in media portrayals - even singing competitions. Major John Hawksley, in the southern part of the Ypres Salient, wrote home that:\n\n&gt;[Both sides] sang in English Home sweet home together. Then God save the King was sung by both. I don’t know what words the Germans sang to this tune. Then late on a German shouted out to the Warwicks – ‘We won’t fire tomorrow if tomorrow if you don’t’. Our men shouted back ‘All right’.”\n\nIn other cases however, contact was much less emotional, with just a white flag in the morning leading to a meeting to establish the truce.\n\nOften, the time was used for nothing more than to bury the dead who had been sitting in No-Man’s-Land, as well as the Germans returning a number of dead who attacked a few day’s prior, at least in the section of the Scots Guards. Joint prayer sessions are attested to by the Scots as well, as well as the trading of small goodies and paraphernalia, such as food or badges. But often, whatever Truce existed was little more than an informal understanding to hold fire. Interactions between the two sides in No Man’s Land often lasted no more than 30 minutes or so, rather than an all day affair, although agreements to ceasefire lasted longer. In many areas, that time was utilized to repair defensive works, replacing barbed wire or bailing out flooded trenches.\n\nThe football games are by far the most famed occurrence, but they were at best informal (In his work on the War, Martin Gilbert notes *\"a football was kicked around\"*), and real, proper, verified accounts are very few, so how many games actually happened is up in the air (In the recent Sainsbury’s ad, Taff Gillingham, the historical adviser, wrote afterwards that he had to press hard to keep soccer from being a dominant theme of the ad). Although some of the most explicit accounts are certainly frauds, there is enough evidence to believe some games certainly happened though, but far from being a veritable World Cup up and down the front, it at best was little more than a handful of informal games, especially relative to the millions of men then manning the front. In “To End All Wars\" by Hochchild, a German Lt. is quoted quite famously stating:\n\n&gt;Teams were quickly established … and the Fritzes beat the Tommies 3–2.\n\nBut in fact, this account by Johannes Niemann of the 133rd (9th Royal Saxon) Infantry is a recollection coming many decades after the war, in an interview from the 1960s, and is highly questionable in its details, least of all as he never mentioned it previously when speaking on the topic! Hochchild also notes that a Brit is reported to have written somewhat ambiguously:\n\n&gt;The Germans came out … they’re good fellows on the whole and play the game.\n\nBut this can fit cleanly into the many verified reports of a *desire* for a game to happen being expressed by both sides, with no game happening, or plans for one at a later date not bearing fruit. One of the best attested to games, written of in a diary kept by an unknown ‘Tommy’ mentions a game being played, but heavily implies that it was not against the Germans, but simply among the British themselves taking advantage of the lull:\n\n&gt;a game of football at the back of our trenches! We’ve had a few Germans over to see us this morning. They also sent a party over to bury a sniper we shot in the week. He was about a 100 yards from our trench. A few of our fellows went out and helped to bury him.\n\nHe later goes on to note that later in the day there was another brief meeting in No Man’s Land which brought about an exchange of small souvenirs, so it should be clear that had the Germans played too, this would be included! A Capt. Hamilton wrote of a challenge that was issued for a game to be played later (New Years?), noting that *“A Coy were to have played the Saxon Corps, but were relieved”*. In fact, there is, best as I can find, only a bare handful of games played which are corroborated by multiple, reliable sources, as there are two German accounts from the 133rd (9th Royal Saxon), the aforementioned by Lt. Niemann which mention playing a game at Frelinghien against the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on “a frozen meadow”, and a second from a letter written home by a German soldier to his mother. There is no account from the British side there, but for a second game, we have a degree of corroboration from men of the British 5th Division that they *“kick[ed] a football about between the two firing lines”*, and a second writer noting \"*we had a rare old jollification, which included football, in which the Germans took part,*\" but just how much of an actual game was played still is up in the air. As with the 133rd’s accounts however, there is again no accounts from the other (German) side in this case.\n\nHow long the meetings lasted also varied wildly, with at least a small number of reports of it lasting for some time, and other places maybe just a half hour before officers ordered men back to the trenches. In one of the attested occurrences, which is visible in the afore mentioned Sainsbury’s ad, is a German barber giving a Brit a haircut. Against all odds, according to both Ferro and Hochschild, the German was his normal barber back in London (the large number of reservists who, until only a few months prior, had been living and working in London is also considered to be a contributory factor to the truce). Which isn’t that hard to believe as there was a large number of Germans who had been in London prior to the outbreak of war, often employed in the service industry. Another German gave a Brit a letter to mail to his British girlfriend. \n\nThe French, although considerably less inclined to friendliness given the circumstances, did in some cases return German overtures. Writing to his wife, François Guilhem remarked:\n\n&gt;You can imagine how astonished we were to hear the Boches singing hymns in their trenches and the French in theirs; then the Boches sang their national anthem and cheered. the French responded with the “Chant du départ”. All this singing from thousands of men right out in the countryside was truly magical.\n\nIn some places though, the truce ended in gunfire. In at least one area, a Scottish unit ended up shooting a German working party for an unspecified reason, bringing a premature end to the matter. In other sectors, the truce lasted through New Years, or at least a ceasefire remained in place, even if there weren’t further meetings between the lines. In the end, 41 British soldiers were reported killed on the 25th, which while low, was still higher than the numbers for eight other days in the month! \n\nIn a rather darkly humorous occurrence near Ploegsteert Wood, the ceasefire was ended with a strong volley of gunfire by the Germans late on the 31st, to the extreme displeasure of the British, who had been led to understand that it was not to end for another hour, at midnight. It was eventually pointed out the German clocks were set to Berlin time, while British clocks were synched to London, an hour behind, and that with the German fire being aimed quite high above their heads, it was most likely only a New Years celebration, which the British returned in kind an hour later.\n\nOf course, as I noted, not everyone liked it. Adolf Hitler, among others, was not a fan, and reportedly said *“Such a thing should not happen in wartime. Have you no German sense of honor?”*. In French sectors, some French units fired volleys at the Germans and sang “*Marseillaise*\" to celebrate the occasion. Plenty of British too were displeased. Cpt. Ingram wrote to his family:\n\n&gt;All this friendly peace business at Christmas is rotten; we aren’t here to pal up to the enemy and sing carols with him. One regiment especially distinguished themselves by their friendliness to the enemy at Christmas, and their second in command went and sang in the German trenches. This particular regiment is in our brigade and has not been so distinguished when fighting has to be done; in fact quite the contrary. Our men are awfully sick with them over the whole thing, and last night there was a bit of a scrap in the town between some of ours and the carol singing lot. Two or three other regiments who were too pally at Christmas have also had to fight their friends since; good thing too.\n\nOn other sectors of the line, attacks were carried out on the 25th, again mostly by the French. And of course the higher-ups were not pleased. When reports showed up of what had happened, commanders quickly sent out orders to stop it from occurring again. Gen. French’s remarked *“I issued immediate orders to prevent any recurrence of such conduct”* *(Although Hochschild remarks that during the Boer War, French was happy to send whiskey and cigars under a flag of truce to his Boer counterpart)*. One account has a German soldier crossing the lines under a flag of truce following a barrage to apologize to the French soldiers of the 99th Infantry on the other side for what had happened, since while they had agreed to a ceasefire through the New Years, higher command had seen fit to “spoil” it. And while one regiment might be participating, only a hundred yards down the wat another might not. A sergeant of the Monmouthshires was felled by a German sniper while crossing to share a cigarette, one regiment having laid down their arms for the day while the next over remaining 'vigilant'. The German commander issued an apology for the incident.\n\nAnd while meeting in the middle was fine, wandering too close to the enemy trenches was still considered a serious offense in many cases, as noted by one British soldier:\n\n&gt;Having come about halfway to our lines, he suddenly stopped and waited. Then one of our men was seen to go out and meet him to bring him into our lines. Unfortunately he had not been blindfolded, and consequently he had to be made prisoner of war. He protested and was awfully upset about it, but he had seen the position behind our lines and that must be kept from the enemy at all costs.\n\nAnd those who weren’t in the trenches didn’t celebrate with the enemy either. The Germans made their first air attack on Britain, bombing Dover on Christmas Eve, and the British Navy attempted to return the favor, sending planes over Cuxhaven on the 25th, although the planes had to turn back, with only one bombing his “target”, which later turned out to be a fish-drying shed, rather than the Zeppelin hanger he was after. And in an interesting ‘first’, a German attempt at a second raid, this time on the 25th, resulted in the first air-to-air interception, with an RFC Gunbus successfully driving off a German FF29 as it attempted to bomb London that day.\n\nBack at home, Socialists and other anti-war activists heralded it as the working-man seeing their common humanity. Keir Hardie wrote that it was part of the soldiers realizing \"that the workers of the world are not ‘enemies’ to each other, but comrades.\" Most writers though don’t ascribe such high-minded principles to the matter. Such temporary cessations to hostilities can be found in many earlier conflicts, and really, this was one of the last occurrences of such matters, and unique more for being the end of it, rather than being singular. To quote Peter Hart:\n\n&gt;There was no real desire for compromise or negotiation: the Christmas Truce was an exercise in sentimentality and nothing more.\n\nWhile authorities were certainly in no way pleased, it is not true, as is often said, that the British attempted to suppress word of the truce, with plenty of unit war diaries recording it for posterity. 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles faithfully recorded:\n\n&gt;Nothing of importance happened until 8 p.m. when heralded by various jovialities from their trenches the Germans placed lamps on their parapets and commenced singing. Various remarks such as “If you English come out and talk to us – we won’t fire”, etc., etc., were shouted. On which our men came out and both British and Germans met halfway between their respective trenches and conversed. A good many Germans spoke English well. They were well clothed and clean shaved; good physique, rather inclining to extremes of age.\n\nAdditionally plenty of letters made it passed the censor unblackened to tell friends and family back home what has passed. London papers were filled with accounts, many with positive headlines such as \"REMARKABLE CHRISTMAS DAY INCIDENTS\". In comparison, the reaction by the French was quite vicious. Recalled the Welshman Frank Richards:\n\n&gt;When we were passing through Armentières, all the French women were standing in the doorways and shouting about us fraternizing with the Germans – they didn’t half give it us.\n\nOne of the most enduring myths of the truce is that units were severely punished for having participated. In fact, there is no evidence for the Germans, British, or French, that units who had been part of the truce were moved to worse sectors or otherwise censured. For the most part, units would continue to occupy the same sector for a year or more later, and the worst punishment that Marc Ferro makes note of is the canceling of home leave for several officers for their \"convivial zeal\".\n\nThe next year, truces were much more rare. Attempts were made on Easter by a few German units to replicate the Christmas ceasefire without success, and as December neared, commanders gave very strict orders against it, and often artillery barrages were scheduled during the day to discourage any such behavior. A typical directive, sent by Lt. Col. Hitchcock of the 47th (London) Division, sent the following order on Dec. 19th:\n\n&gt;The G.O.C. directs me to remind you of the unauthorized truce which occurred on Christmas Day at one or two places in the line last year, and to impress upon you that nothing of the kind is to be allowed on the Divisional front this year.\n\n&gt;The Artillery will maintain a slow gun fire on the enemy’s trenches commencing at dawn, and every opportunity will as usual be taken to inflict casualties upon any of the enemy exposing themselves.\n\nReports of the occasional carol sung across the line, or a Christmas tree bedecked with candles placed on the German parapet (quickly riddled with British fire) filter through, but the recollection of Cpl. Pankhurst, with the Royal Field Artillery, 56th Division, were the norm of the day:\n\n&gt;We hailed the smiling morn with five rounds fired fast, and we kept up slow fire all day. Those were our orders. Some batteries sent over as many as three hundred shells. It was a Christmas present to Fritz, they said. But I do believe myself that it was intended to discourage fraternizing.\n\nSome services were held behind the lines, but for the most part, the day was mostly indistinguishable from any normal day on the front. Certainly a few soldiers attempted to replicate the meetings of the previous year, but quite distressingly for the British commanders, they had been members of the prestigious 1st Scot Guards. The meeting was quickly curtailed once a senior officer caught wind, but nevertheless it caused great consternation at First Army HQ. The incident kept out of the press, but two officers court-martialed for allowing it to occur.\n\nSo in the end, what can we say for certain happened? Well, there was a Truce. At points along the front, the fighting stopped, and both sides met and interacted, but that’s about it. Professionals and reservists, they were more likely driven by their occupational bond as soldiers - the very thing making them fight - than their common humanity. It showed a lack of hate, rather than a breaching of it. It never pointed to any likelihood of the soldiers discovering the enemy \"was just like them\" and refusing to continue the fight. Attitudes before and after were not much changed, and the soldiers for the most part had little trouble returning to war after the brief lull.\n\nAnd additionally, it is quite wrong to extrapolate that into a front wide occasion, as it was anything but. Given the nature of how the Truce came about it was very much compartmentalized, with the Christmas experience of any given unit varying wildly. Stories of friendly soccer games in No Man’s Land warm the heart, but they unfortunately give a rather false impression just of what happened, as while a few accounts make mention of a football, the image of games played all over the front is as wrong as can be. Military history is filled with brief lulls such as this, of which the 1914 Truce is really just the last notable occurrence, rather than an anomaly. And as with so many previous interactions with the enemy, we can’t lose sight of the reality, that days later, these men were right back to shooting each other. In the end, it is well summarized by Marc Ferro when he notes:\n\n&gt;In the matter of the basic task of the armies fighting in France and Belgium, it meant little. It was a brief holiday, a pause before the necessary burdens of the war were once again resumed.\n\n**Sources**\n\n*To End All Wars* by Adam Hochschild\n\n*The First World War* by Martin Gilbert\n\n*The Great War* by Peter Hart\n\n*Catastrophe* by Max Hastings\n\n*Britain at War: 1914: An Illustrated History of the First Year of the Great War* edited by Martin Mace\n\n*1915: The Death of Innocence* by Lyn Macdonald\n\n*Civility: The true lesson of 1914 Christmas truce* by Terri Blom Crocker\n\n*Meetings in No Man's Land: Christmas 1914 and Fraternisation in the Great War* by Marc Ferro, Malcolm Brown, Rémy Cazais, &amp; Olaf Mueller\n\nAdditionally, [the stellar work of Taff Gillingham](http://www.mrallsophistory.com/revision/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Taff-Gillingham-Twitter-combined.pdf), who most recently served as the historical advisor for the Sainsbury's ad.\n\n**TL;DR**: A truce happened. Maybe two or three soccer balls were kicked along the entire front. Most meetings lasted only briefly, and the time was often used to fix up trenches and barbed wire to prepare for when the fighting resumed.

        "text": "In a delightful example of how any discussion on the internet has a percentage chance of spontaneously combusting into random drama, [a small fight broke out](https://np.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/3xtm78/facebook_soldier_explains_the_meaning_of_sad/cy7y8fc) yesterday in /r/thathappened over the English language's rise to its current position of global predominance. I have no idea as to how this relates to that particular thread's topic (something about soldiers cradling dead children) but a certain DeputyDomeshot made the bold claim that\n\n&gt; The reason most of world today can speak English is because of England and the amazing ways British art, expression, and innovation has permeated other cultures.\n\n&gt; Oh wait, that's AMERICA.\n\nCue much downvoting, mirth and laughter, with people pointing out the existence of the British Empire. This quickly spread to /r/subredditdrama and /r/shitamericanssay and one of those famed Reddit circlejerks formed, with the downvotes mounting (-114 at the time of writing). The general sentiment of the circlejerk, across three subreddits, could be summed up by comments like:\n\n&gt; It was literally because of the British Empire you bafoon [sic]\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n&gt; omg this has got to be a troll\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; [English's position today is] certainly not because of the British Empire taking over half the world....\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n&gt; **Eng**lish\n\n\n\n&gt; **Eng**land\n\n\n&gt; What a coincidence!\n\nHowever, I come here not to bury DeputyDomeshot but to praise(-ish) him/her. Unfortunately for those wits jerking hard against our American friend, he/she is probably right, or at least has a valid point that's been drowned out in the noise. To be clear: it's the responses to DeputyDomeshot, denying the role of the US in the spread of English, that are bad history.\n\n**English as more than a global language**\n\nAs a global language, English unquestionably owes much to empire. That there are large native-speaking English across the world (and countries where English is a common working language) is in large part due to that proud English/British tradition of sailing around the world and stealing lands. But this alone explains little about English's remarkable position in the world today. Both French and Spanish can similarly claim to be global languages in this sense.\n\nSo what is it that elevates English above these other languages? What accounts for the *spread of English* beyond its colonial borders to become a truly global lingua franca, spoken from Indonesia to Italy? Why is English not limited to an Anglosphere, an equivalent of la Francophonie?\n\nAnd that's what's interesting about English. It's not that it has a lot of native speakers but that it's become an important asset in most professional, political or cultural fields across the world. As Jiao Xue and Wenjing Zuo note (in their own 'international English'):\n\n&gt; Whether you like English or not, if you want to enter into the wave of globalization and informatization, and conduct effective international communications, or you want to become an influential politician, merchant and scientist, you must be able to use English to communicate.\n\nEmpire alone does not explain how this has come about. To be blunt: the fact English is an official language in India and Nigeria is of little relevance in understanding why most Finnish scientific papers are today published in English.\n\n**English in the American Century**\n\nSpeaking of science, it provides a clear example of the growing importance of English. In 1920 the most popular language for scientific papers was German (followed by English and French). By 1960 English had passed this, growing to 50% of all papers published. By 1980 it was at 75% and accelerating: in 1996 91% of scientific papers were in English. Today approximately 1% of scientific papers are published in German and entire journals have simply switched to English, name and all. To become an internationally renowned scientist today almost requires some ability to communicate in English.\n\nOther areas are less easy to track, given the absence of such an obvious metric, but the trend is clear. French remained the lingua franca of diplomats until WWII, albeit with English's prominence growing in the interwar years. English was given a particularly boost by the founding of the UN and the emergence of the US as a superpower. In business, English has quickly spread along with globalisation, as Western companies and their technologies march around the world. Anecdotally, I've sat in Russian call centres where no one spoke English but the operators were still obliged to type English phrases (in the Latin alphabet) because the IT system used was American. This is the reach of English at the coalface.\n\nFor our purposes, what's particularly interesting about all this is that this rise of English as a global lingua franca largely post-dates the demise of the Empire and has little to do with colonial structures.\n\nInstead this spread is largely a product of the second half of the 20th C: that period of economic and political dominance by the US. There are some specific factors at work in each area (eg developments in the field of science were largely due to US sponsored translation efforts) but generally \"in the latter half of the 20th century, [English's] widespread use was mostly due to the military, economic and cultural dominance of the United States of America.\" The multinationals, institutions, technologies, etc that have driven the spread of English over the past several decades have largely been American. As David Crystal puts it:\n\n&gt; During the 20th C, [English's] world presence was maintained and promoted almost single-handedly through the new American superpower. Economics replaced politics as the chief driving force. And the language behind the US Dollar was English.\n\n**It's not monocausal, stupid**\n\nTo be clear: none this is to say that the Empire was irrelevant. There were a number of reasons as to why English was at the right place at the right time when it came to exploding globally. But empire does not explain the ability of English to spread beyond colonial borders; for that we have to look at the broader political and economic context of the 20th C. And that's where the Americans come in. The US' political, economic and cultural reach over the past several decades has been key in growing English beyond its colonial borders.\n\nSo DeputyDomeshot may be an ignorant American and they may not have expressed themselves well but they're still not (entirely) wrong to assert that English's current rank owes a great deal to the US. Nor should perfectly reasonable sentiments like \"[I would say it was a team effort by American international businesses and the ridiculously big British Empire](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3xwng1/oneman_dramawave_in_rthathappened_as_redditor/cy8qjjd)\" be getting downvoted in /r/subredditdrama.\n\nBut welcome to Reddit, where people of many languages come mock and misunderstand each other in English.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* David Crystal, *English as a Global Language*\n\n* Anne Johnson, *The Rise of English*\n\n* Afgan Mehtiyev, *The Language of Diplomacy*\n\n* Steven Shapin, [LRB review](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n23/steven-shapin/confusion-of-tongues) of *Scientific Babel*\n\n* Jiao Xue and Wenjing Zuo, *English Dominance and Its Influence on International Communication*",

In the discussion on /r/military, one user [expresses surprise at the lack of Chinese targets](https://np.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/3xvstr/us_cold_war_nuclear_target_lists_declassified_for/cy8hvcw) on the list of cities, to which the top reply is:\n\n&gt;[You got to remember that China was still a peasant economy at the end of the Civil War. There was no real manufacturing sector outside of Beijing with the exception of Hong Kong which was still British at the time. And though manufacturing slowly progressed, It wasn't until Deng Xiao Ping took over and initiated the Great Leap Forward that Chinese Manufacturing really took off blazing. Besides, after the Chinese schism with the Russians and the long-held belief that China didn't have nuclear weapons, It wasn't seen as a massive priority when compared to the soviets.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/3xvstr/us_cold_war_nuclear_target_lists_declassified_for/cy8i936)\n\nHow is this wrong? While it's true that a large portion of China was unindustrialized until after the Chinese Civil War, the rest of the post is a basic research failure. For one thing, Deng Xiaoping didn't initiate the Great Leap Forward. That was Mao Xedong. Deng helped end the failed reforms of the Great Leap Forward, which, among other things, tried to industrialize China by having farmers make forges in their back yards rather than building factories and encouraging people to kill sparrows because they were agricultural nuisances (but didn't realize they kept swarms of locusts in check). Deng and the leaders with whom he worked moved China towards the state-capitalist model that exists in China today. After his discussion of Chinese industrialization, our linked friend talks about the Sino-Soviet split and the Chinese nuclear program. However, the recently-released documents are for the year 1959 and were started in 1956. When the writing of the document started, the Chinese and Soviet relationship had begun to show a few cracks, but their more dramatic break wouldn't happen for several more years. Then the commenter talks about the Chinese nuclear weapons program as if the Chinese already had nuclear weapons by the time the document in question was published internally but the United States was unaware of them. However, China didn't test its first nuclear weapon until five years after the report came out. China was simply not a nuclear state, making an attack on China in the event of nuclear war somewhat unnecessary.",

        "text": "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! Hope you guys all have a great couple of weeks!\n\nAnyways, today we shall look to famous secular Christmas song: The Twelve Days of Christmas, which was secretly [shocking music] **CATHOLIC**. We know this from kinda shitty early 2000 websites such as:\n\n[This](http://www.carols.org.uk/the_twelve_days_of_christmas.htm) , [ that](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/advent/customs-and-traditions/the-history-of-the-twelve-days-of-christmas/) and on the latest episode of the [yogpod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pXUBkQ8rW8)\n\nas the second one states:\n\n&gt;The song, \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol. From 1558 until 1829, Roman Catholics in England were not permitted to practice their faith openly. Someone during that era wrote this carol as a catechism song for young Catholics. It has two levels of meaning: the surface meaning plus a hidden meaning known only to members of the Church. Each element in the carol has a code word for a religious reality which the children could remember. To fit the number scheme, when you reach number 9, representing the Fruits of the Holy Ghost, the originator combined 6 to make 3, taking the 6 fruits that were similar: the fruit in each parenthesis is the that was not named separately. There are actually Twelve Fruits of the Holy Ghost.\n\nHere is the list of the TRUE MEANINGS ^^^TM\n\n&gt; The \"True Love\" one hears in the song is not a smitten boy or girlfriend but Jesus Christ, because truly Love was born on Christmas Day. The partridge in the pear tree also represents Him because that bird is willing to sacrifice its life if necessary to protect its young by feigning injury to draw away predators.\n\n&gt; The two turtle doves were the Old and New Testaments\n\n&gt; The three French hens stood for faith, hope, and love.\n\n&gt; The four calling birds were the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\n\n&gt; The five golden rings represented the first five books of the Old Testament, which describe man's fall into sin and the great love of God in sending a Savior.\n\n&gt; The six geese a-laying stood for the six days of creation.\n\n&gt; Seven swans a-swimming represented the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit-----Prophesy, Serving, Teaching, Exhortation, Contribution, Leadership, and Mercy.\n\n&gt; The eight maids a-milking were the eight beatitudes.\n\n&gt; Nine ladies dancing were the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit-----Charity, Joy, Peace, Patience [Forbearance], Goodness [Kindness], Mildness, Fidelity, Modesty, Continency [Chastity].\n\n&gt; The ten lords a-leaping were the Ten Commandments.\n\n&gt; The eleven pipers piping stood for the eleven faithful Apostles.\n\n&gt; The twelve drummers drumming symbolized the twelve points of belief in The Apostles' Creed.\n\nOkay, sorry Catholics but this isn't true for a couple of reasons.\n\n- there is absolutely no documentation or supporting evidence for this claim whatsoever, other than mere repetition of the claim itself.\n- The claim appears to date only to the 1990s, marking it as likely an invention of modern day speculation rather than historical fact.\n- I mean english protestants could understand and enjoy the \"hidden meaning\" in the song too (if it existed). It's not like one of the lines is \"On the First day of Christmas my true love told me to LOVE THE POPE AND FOLLOW HIS EVERY COMMAND. OVERTHROW THE PROTESTANTS.\"\n- Some of the connections are pretty shit right? I mean there's being subtle and then there's ten lords jumping up and down being 10 ancient laws created by moses on a hill top.\n- The bible is ridiculously long and they do count a lot so it's probably statistical likely that they use the numbers 1 through 12\n\n\nNow according to my basic sources (ala wikipedia and friends) 12 days of Christmas wasn't one of those Catholic conspiracies, but was just a memory game. Players would go on and on with the song, until one of them made a mistake. It was their version of Simon Says. \n\nThe source of these terrible Christmas lies appear to come from one man on the naughty list, Hugh D. McKellar, a Canadian hymnologist who wrote out [his sourceless musings in 1979](http://www.scribd.com/doc/74456918/Twelve-Days-of-Christmas). He states himself that\n&gt;In any case, really evocative symbols do not allow of [sic] definitive explication, exhausting all possibilities. I can at most report what this song's symbols have suggested to me in the course of four decades, hoping thereby to start you on your own quest.\n\n\"This report was found by some other guys and then the internet happened making it truth apparently\" - Abraham Lincoln \n\nSources:\n\n[Definitly not wikipediea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song\\)#cite_ref-33)\n\n[Okay its snopes don't judge me](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/music/12days.asp)\n\n[The lack of evidence for it to begin with](http://tilde.club/~waxpancake/running/)",

        "text": "Hi there badhistory, this is my first post so hopefully I don't stuff up too bad but I saw a series of comments on Facebook and thought I'd have my chance.\n\nSo I was tagged in a post by a friend which was a coloured map of countries Britain had invaded in its history (you may have seen it). Suffice to say I'm not sure how accurate the map is but it was a comment that got me, in which a Facebook user claimed that the British empire despite its empire building had actually lifted countries out of poverty and darkness. I replied to that saying it was a bit disingenuous to claim that to be the case, citing India and Africa as an example of where Britain clearly did not lift anyone out of poverty and pointed out how Britain attempted to destroy local cultures, at which point I was hit with this:\n\n\"Okay if we are going down the path of culture and such, take my country for example. Australia home and native land of aboriginals. Now if they as so much cared for their cultural identity then why dont they all go back to the outlands where they once lived for a more traditional lifestyle. The government has bascially given them that option however modern day living is much more comfortable and \"cultural\" identitiy is dying because they chose to let it. \n\nI am not nieve to think the British never did anything wrong. But they occupied Singapore and after they gave them independence they have since flourished. India, what a sad country that is. We cant blame the brtisih for how its running nowadays they only have themselves to blame for poor governing of an over populated country. There will always be poverty regardless of who invaded who. Britain today even has poverty and areas of the country that are basically lawless. We blame no one but them for that problem. The british had a fair idea on how to run an empire, although there methods regarding some areas of history are very wrong that doesn't mean we condemn them as a whole as being bad.\"\n\nI'm not a historian but I am an Australian, and armed with my high school history knowledge I can tell you that Indigenous Australians have not chosen to let their culture die and that its degradation did result from the colonial period and the attitudes of Europeans at the time, but apparently the stolen generation or the Tasmanian genocide doesn't count. Also if the guy really believes that all aboriginal people have the option to just go out and return to pre colonial aboriginal life then may I remind him that aboriginal people have been removed rather intentionally by Europeans from that life for a very long time, and that living in a traditional manner as he assert is possible is not nearly as doable as he might think.\n\nIndian history I am a bit less familiar with so I did some reading, this initially resulted in myself arguing that India's problems did stem from the colonial period citing poverty and famine, but on a better reading of the source from a user below it would now be better to say that British rule whilst not great for India in terms of agricultural technology and wage increases, did see an increase in agricultural output, famines did occur and Britain could have done more to alleviate them but the famines themselves were not always a result of British rule. Indian industry did suffer under the early colonial period but returned later when it was more favourable to British interests. \n\nUltimately though I would argue that British rule in India was still intentionally exploitative and that the idea that Britain uplifted India is still an incorrect notion. Britain in the colonial period certainly helped shape modern India in some arguably positive ways, but the idea that all of India's problems post-colonialism are of India's making seems to me to be very unlikely.\n\nFinally he points out Singapore as being a success, I don't know much about Singapore's history but I think it's pretty safe to say that just because Britain perhaps succeeded in creating a couple of functioning nation states after giving up its empire does not mean that they get a free pass out of being condemned for their actions in the colonial period and that yes, we can indeed condemn the British empire for what it did.\n\nEdit: /u/Thoctar gives a pretty good run down about Singapores history relevant to this thread which simply further shows the poor reasoning this Facebook user applied.\n\nEdit 2: /u/Medieval-Evil pointed out that my source for economic and agricultural conditions under British rule didn't entirely agree with what I was saying, so I've revised the section on India to reflect what I think is a better reading of the source.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.rt.com/news/india-independence-britain-dehli-681\n\nhttp://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/articles/moghul_3.pdf\n\nhttp://theconversation.com/tasmanias-black-war-a-tragic-case-of-lest-we-remember-25663\n\nhttp://www.australianstogether.org.au/stories/detail/the-stolen-generations",

        "author": "meeeow",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3xtneu/can_we_discuss_the_nuclear_bombing_of_hiroshima/",
        "text": "This isn't so much a bad history post as it is a discussion request (which I hope is ok by the rules). I also want to preface this by saying that I'm not a Historian in any shape or form, I just have an interest in the social sciences and hope to one day have the funds to go into a masters on the field.\n\nI've been in Reddit for a few years and this is the only place where I have encountered what is in my view an apologist justification for the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in WW2. I have seen countless people arguing  that it was a sound decision by President Truman since it prevented an invasion that would have cost million of lives of both the Japanse and Allies.\n\nThis has always struck me as bad history, specially when it's told from the context of the bomb itself and the dropping of it as the apex of the Japanese defeat. Further it was never the perspective I developed learning this period from a wonderful history teacher who liked to teach by giving us a linear series of events and getting us to discuss them, rather than telling us what happened and why. I digress The fact is that this period of history has interested me but I know very little about Japanese history. I'm going to convey what I know, how I know and I would love to hear perspectives of ideas I might not have considered. \n\nThe first thing that bothers me about the suggestion that the nuking drove surrender is that it had become pretty clear by August 1945 that the Japanese high powers were not particularly bothered by the bombing when it comes down to it. Though the cost of life was great, the military remained relatively untouched and still armored and in position to defend an invasion in Okinawa. After the U.S. was able to set bases in the Mariana Islands raids were constant and from March 1945 mostly directed at urban centres. The firebombings had hit all major cities in Japan and pretty much levelled them. In June LeMay extended the bombing campaign to hit small cities along-side the major targets. \n\nIn August 6th 1945 President Truman made his now famous threat:\n\n&gt;*\"If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\"*\n\nBut by that point there were very few cities left to bomb in Japan. This is often the point used to drive home that the nukes were necessary but to me this just undermines the whole thing. Comparatevly Hiroshima was a drop in the bucket of a much larger scale campaign that had destroyed more of other cities and it *still hadn't led to surrender*. \n\nIt also undermines the apologist perspective, the allies were clearly not particularly bothered about the lost of human life in Japan's side considering they had specifically target urban and civillian areas. You can certainly still say that the U.S. wanted to preserve it's own soldiers but in the context of the bombing campaign it becomes very hard to say that they wanted to preserve Japanese land and life.\n\nIf bombings drove the surrender, the Japanse would have convened when Hiroshima was attacked, but that didn't come until 3 days later. True Nagasaki was bombed that day, but as I said above news of bombings were coming thick and fast, indeed the Supreme Court of Japan had already begun their discussion on surrender before the attack. So if that didn't drive the surrender what did? In my view it was the Soviets. We have a tendency to forget that the 9th was also when Russia begun its invasion of Manchuria and steam-rolled their way across. \n\nIt meant that the Russians could no longer be the mediators between the Allies and Japan in negotiating surrender. It would have made sense before, the Russians would have stopped terms that were too favourable to the U.S \n\nThis completely shifted Japan's strategic position. Up to that point they were losing, and they could see the war was nearing it's end, but they still had a relatively large army guarding it's islands. They had some time. If diplomacy failed it would make sense to chip away at the U.S. until they offered better terms. So the importance of the invasion is that it severly limited the time-scale the Japanse had. It was predicted the Soviets could be in mainland Japan, through Hokkaido in less than two weeks.\n\nIt's generally believe that Japan would not surrender under any circumstances and the bomb forced their hand. I don't think that was the key issue, the Japanese were not stupid they knew they would not win a war against the Allies, and specially not once Russia joined in. The key issue were the terms of the surrender, they saw what was happening to Nazi leaders captured in Germany, there was serious concern that the divine Emperor and leaders would be trialed for war crimes, that their way of life and government would be extinct. \n\nThe question remains as to why this narrative is still so pertinant, and the answer for me is convenience. If the Emperor and his court could say that the reason for loss was a magical, unpredictable bomb that nobody could have accounted for it allows him to sweep his incomptence during the war under the rug. Same for the other Japanese leaders. And this is supported by evidence, in November 1945, Koichi Kido, the Emperors closest advisor said:\n\n&gt;*\"The feeling that the emperor and I had about the atomic bombing was that the psychological moment we had long waited for had finally arrived to resolutely carry out the termination of the war. [...] We felt that if we took the occasion and utilized the psychological shock of the bomb to follow through, we might perhaps succeed in ending the war\"*\n\nand goes on to say:\n\n&gt;*\"we of the peace party had already been scheming for a termination of the war, and* **it is not correct to say that we were driven by the atomic bomb to end the war**. *Rather, it might be said that we of the peace party were assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war.\"*\n\nIn other words, surrender was already under discussion, the bombs provided their needed pretext. It also gave Japanese leaders something to blame when it came discussing the surrender with Americans. As Asada Sadao puts it, they were eager to please the American interviewers while defending the Emperor. If both wanted to blame the bomb why contradict them? *(Asada Sadao, The Shock of the Atomic Bomb and Japan's Decision to Surrender: A Reconsideration (1998), pp. 484)*\n\nFor the Americans, they could and still say that it was the kindest possible way to end the war, saving millions of lives from a conflict that would have dragged on for months. It paints the dropping of the bomb in an almost benevolent light which, which wow, it makes me both horrified and amazed (which is generally my reaction to America in most wars). It excuses their on-going involved in the re-building of Japan and directing where they wanted it to go in the following years. And of course it gives the Americans the upper hand in Soviet relationships for two main reasons:\n\n**A.** It allowed them show to the world their newest weapon and send a very clear message: we have big toys and we are willing to use them. Plus it let them actually test the impact of such a bomb while it also justified the cost of its development and testing.\n\n**B.** It increased U.S. diplomatic influence not just in Asia but in the world. There was already a percpetion that the U.S. had single-handedly won the war in Europe, and now it had also won the war in the pacific. Put simply it painted itself, not Russia as the deciding factor of surrender. \n\nThere is plenty more evidence that points in the direction of this post which I have not included here. [This debate](http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/28318) is particularly interesting in my opinion. And there are plenty of texts that focus specifically on the timing of meetings of Japanese leaders to highlight that it couldn't have been just Hiroshima and Nagasaki that drove the end of the war. What fascinated me is that to me once you take a time to look at the order of events a particular conclusion is almost inevitable (a bold claim, I know I'll get heat for this, but luck favours the brave) but at large it seems a lot of people are extremely resistant to it and I think that comes to how central to our perception of the nuclear question the dropping of Little Boy and Fat Man are.\n\nThese bombings define nuclear weapon's and their special status, as a place in history we never want to revisit, it's in many ways the very justification for military doctrines like MAD and the bedrock of nuclear strategy. All roads lead to Rome and all talks of nuclear strikes lead to Japan. Really, it needs its own version of Godwin's Law. To question the historiology surrounding Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be seen to question the many conclusions derived from how we perceive those events. If the surrender of Japan is not the miracle we believe it to be suddenly there is a lot less reason to defend the use of the bombs.\n\nOf course there is an added more uncomfortable factor, but that acceptance that your country and its allies did something that was unecessarilly monstrous is difficult. I speak this as someone who grew up in England, while we are quick to point at Nazi war crimes bring up the mere *possibility* of discussing the firebombing of Dresden as a war-crime and people will be immediatly defensive. I don't think I ever met anyone outside of my history circle who has even heard of things like the Canicatti Massacre or Operation Teardrop either. The mythology of the 'Greatest Generation' is strong, and it seems that to question events or ask for the greys in what is always portrayed as a very black and white conflict equals questioning the bravery and sacrifice of those involved. It's a messy and understanbly sentimental issue many remain very sensitive about. But question, analysis and criticism do not equal disrespect. They should be encouraged and welcomed, not brushed aside.",

Kennedy\n\nwhich is apparently legit; at least wikiquote cites it.\n\nWow Johnny I thought you were dickish and much overrated *before* I found out you were secretly into Hitler.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual bad history!\n\n\n&gt; We are all familiar with the story of Hitler that the United States would like you to believe.  Hitler has been made out to be one of the most “evil” people to have ever lived, slaughtering millions of innocent jews.  This same story has been echoed throughout Hollywood for decades, and by now it’s safe to say billions of dollars have been spent to convince you of this black and white, good vs evil perspective about the Nazi regime.  \n\nNot \"made out to be\" you fucking weasel. Hollywood (by which we both know you mean DA JOOOOOZ) hasn't spent a penny convincing anyone of this; in fact they (insofar as there's even a \"they\") have made quite a bit of money on WW2 and Holocaust flicks.\n\nLet us move on to the points you wish to make.\n\n&gt;**1. Hitler Broke Free from the International Banking Cartels**\n\nBy which, again, you mean DA JOOOOOOOZ.\n\n&gt;In his 1967 book The Magic of Money, Hitler’s Reichsbank President, Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, let out the big secret:\n\n&gt;“THE MARK’S DRAMATIC DEVALUATION BEGAN SOON AFTER THE REICHSBANK WAS “PRIVATIZED,” OR DELIVERED TO PRIVATE INVESTORS.”\n\nAnd I believe a Nazi banker why?\n\nBit of actual history here: Weimar hyperinflation was caused in part by the need to buy large amouts of foreign currency for reparations, in part by financially supporting the general strikers in the French-occupied Ruhr, and mostly by the characteristic timidity of Weimar politicians in the face of opposition to tax increases and budget cuts. Not a international banking cartel in sight.\n\nSource: *The Myths of Reparations* by Sally Marks.\n\nBut here's the main bad history in this point: Far from fighting international banks, the Nazis actively sought their collaboration (most famously the Swiss) to launder their ill-gotten gains from both domestic corruption and the looting of occupied territories.\n\nSource: *Hitler's Secret Bankers* by Adam LeBor\n\nLet us close this little section off with this quote\n\n&gt;Debt Free Finance = Freedom\n\nbecause holy shit.\n\n&gt;**2. Hitler Created a Thriving Economy with No Unemployment**\n\nA bold claim!\n\nThe Nazis did in fact radically reduce unemployment. The \"created\" part is, of course, problematic; given the disastrous effects of Weimar monetary policy, pretty much any attempt at stability, no matter how half-assed, would look great by comparison. But we do have some fantastic bad history in this quote:\n\n&gt;IT’S OFTEN BEEN CLAIMED, THAT HITLER’S SUCCESS IN REVIVING HIS NATION’S ECONOMY WAS BASED LARGELY ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING FOR REARMAMENT. THIS IS A MYTH. AS THE RENOWNED BRITISH HISTORIAN A. J. P. TAYLOR NOTED: “GERMANY’S ECONOMIC RECOVERY, WHICH WAS COMPLETE BY 1936, DID NOT REST ON REARMAMENT; IT WAS CAUSED MAINLY BY LAVISH EXPENDITURE ON PUBLIC WORKS, PARTICULARLY ON MOTOR ROADS, AND THIS PUBLIC SPENDING STIMULATED PRIVATE SPENDING ALSO, AS [BRITISH ECONOMIST JOHN MAYNARD] KEYNES HAD SAID IT WOULD. …WHILE NEARLY EVERYONE ELSE IN EUROPE EXPECTED A GREAT WAR, HITLER WAS THE ONE MAN WHO NEITHER EXPECTED NOR PLANNED FOR IT.”\n– A. J. P. TAYLOR, FROM SARAJEVO TO POTSDAM \n\nRenowned British 'istorian A. J. P. Taylor is talking out of his ass.\n\nBy 1936 the Nazis were spending over 10% of the German GPD (not expenditures! GDP! St. Ronald Himself would have felt this was too much!) on armaments. The economic \"miracle\" was destined to crash; exports declined almost 10% between '33 and '36 and the German government careened from financial near-disaster to near-disaster througout Nazi rule.\n\nSource: *The Wages of Destruction* by Adam Tooze\n\n&gt;**3.

Especially badhistory about the bible.\n\n&gt; [Page 174, Chapter 37: Langdon finally tells Sophie the history of the grail, continuing the history of the Templars (see previous post):] \"Despite Clement's false charges and best efforts to eradicate them, the Knights had powerful allies, and some managed to escape the Vatican purges.\"\n\nClement V. was the very pope who relocated the Holy See from the Vatican to Poitiers to Avignon. Hence he is not the Vatican. \n\nNow follows a part where Sophie forgets her mastery of the French language so that Langdon can explain things about Sangreal =&gt; holy grail to the reader. It's not badhistory per se, it's just annoying and /r/charactersforgettheirmothertongue, I wanted to mention it.\n\n&gt; [Page 183, Chapter 40: Langdon recalls the key, which Sophie found after decoding the riddles of her grandfather, the key has a cross on it, which Langdon immidiatly connects to the Templars:] \"The equal-armed cruciform was symbolic of balance and harmony but also of the Knights Templar. Everyone had seen paintings of Knights Templar wearing white tunics emblazoned with red equal-armed crosses. Granted, the arms of the Templars cross were slightly flared at the ends, but they were still of equal length.\"\n\nSo, basically, Professor of \"Symbology\" Langdon mistakes [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Switzerland.svg/2000px-Flag_of_Switzerland.svg.png) with [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Templar_Flag_6.svg/2000px-Templar_Flag_6.svg.png). He later berates himself for this after they found out that the key was for a box in a swiss bank, but maybe he should be more cautious with his \"symbology\" \"skills\" in general.\n\n&gt; [Page 220, Chapter 48: Sophie and Langdon receive a closed cylinder after they open the bank box to which the aformentioned key leads. Langdon immediately has a hypothesis what that cylinder is:] \"Did your grandfather ever speak to you about something called *la cléf de voûte*? [...] In English we call it a keystone.\" [...] Keystone as a masonry technique for stone archways had been one of the best-kept secrets of the early Masonic brotherhood *The Royal Arch degree*. *Architecture*. *Keystones*. It was all interconnected. The secret knowledge of how to use a wedged keystone to build a vaulted archway was part of the wisdom that made the Masons such wealthy craftsman, and it was a secret they guarded carefully. \n\nThis leaves us with two options: Romans, who could and would build vaulted arches, were taught the technique by the Masons. Or all builders since the Romans were Masons. Which is both unsustainable by rational thought.\nIn Langdonverse all the conspiracies are linked. It doesn't matter if you are Templar, or Freemason, in the end, the Prieuré created all.\n\nThey seek out Leigh Teabing, an aristocratic, obscenely rich, incredible nerdy expert of the Grail to ask him about the Grail and Leonardo. Teabing calls Sophie \"M'lady\" at one point, and \"virgin\" (in grail-things) in another, in one word: a well-rounded character. \n\n&gt; [Page 250, Chapter 55: Teabing starts with a lecture about Leonardo's feelings about the New Testament:] \"*Many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.* [...] \"Here's another\", Teabing said, pointing to a different quote. *Blinding ignorance does mislead us. O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!* Sophie felt a little chill. \"Da Vinci is talking about the bible?\" Teabing nodded.\n\nThe first quote describes Leonardo's feelings towards alchemists. The passage before the quote in Leonardo's notebooks is even titled *Against Alchemists*. The second one is between aphorisms about misusing the intellect. \n\n&gt; [Page 251:Teabing follows this up with talking about the bible as not being a monolithic book. Which is true. But then he talks about Jesus:] \"Jesus Christ was a historical figure of staggering influence, perhaps the most enigmatic and inspirational leader the world has ever seen. As the prophesied Messiah, Jesus toppled kings, inspired millions, and founded new philosophies. As a descendant of the lines of King Solomon and King David, Jesus possessed a rightful claim to the throne of the King of the Jews. Understandably, His life was recorded by thousands of followers across the land.\"\n\nSo, Teabing really thinks that Jesus had a serious claim to the throne? His claims base on a guy (Salomon) who was (if he ever lived) dead 900 years when Jesus lived. That is equivalent to Teabing supporting the claim of one of the descendents of Harold Godwinson for the throne of England, ignoring all that happend between. Jesus' live wasn't recorded by *thousands* of followers, or we should have a lot more actual records of Jesus, than the ones we have are from about fifty to hundred years after his death.\n\n&gt; [Teabing's version of the forming of the New Testament:] \"More than eighty gospels were considered for the New Testament, and yet only a relative few were chosen for inclusion--Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John among them.\"\n\nEighty seem to be a lot more than the about twenty (in the most generous definition of gospel) of which there is evidence during the first centuries of Christendom. Also, Matthew, Mark,Luke and John were \"among the few chosen\". They were the only ones chosen.\n\n&gt; [Teabing continues the forming of the New Testament:] \"\"Aha!\" Teabing burst in with enthusiasm. \"The fundamental irony of Christianity! The Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman emperor Constantine the Great.\"\n\nThere was no canonical New Testament for the first centuries of Christendom. This problem was known to the Church. Finally, in 367 Athanasius defined the layout of the New Testament Christians still use. Synods shortly afterward recommended the use of this layout, but it still wasn't official until 1546. Constantine wasn't involved at all.\n\n&gt; [Teabing still goes on:] \"In Constantine's day, Rome's official religion was sun worship--the cult of Sol Invictus, or the Invincible Sun - and Constantine was its head priest. Unfortunately for him, a growing religious turmoil was gripping Rome. Three centuries after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, Christ's followers had multiplied exponentially. Christians and pagans began warring, and the conflict grew to such proportions that it threatened to rend Rome in two. Constantine decided something had to be done. In 325 A.D., he decided to unify Rome under a single religion. Christianity.\"\n \nHow should the Christians be warring against the Pagans? Until 313, when the Edict of Milan was instituted, Christians could be persecuted for their worship. A one-sided warring indeed. Christianity became Roman state religion in 380, 43 years after Constantine's death. Also, for reasons other than a Pagan/Christian divide: It was against Arianism, another creed of Christianity. \n\n&gt; [This nonsense still goes on:] Sophie was surprised. \"Why would a pagan emperor choose Christianity as the official religion?\"\n\n&gt; Teabing chuckled. \"Constantine was a very good businessman. He could see that Christianity was on the rise, and he simply backed the winning horse. Historians still marvel at the brilliance with which Constantine converted the sun-worshipping pagans to Christianity. By fusing pagan symbols, dates, and rituals into the growing Christian tradition, he created a kind of hybrid religion that was acceptable to both parties.\"\n\nChristianity in 312 or 325 wasn't the winning horse. It was the outsider still standing on the starting line in terms of numbers of followers.\n\n&gt; [Page 252: Langdon joins in the nonsense about the evil genius Constantine fusing Paganism and Christianity into a frankenstein-monsteresque religion:] \"[V]irtually all the elements of the Catholic ritual - the miter, the altar, the doxology, and communion, the act of \"God-eating\"-were taken directly from earlier pagan mystery religions.\"\n\nPagan mystery religions like Judaism. The altar, the doxology (hymns of praise during worship), parts of the communion were taken from Judaism. The \"god-eating\" aspect of the communion is, as freaking Paulus writes, a original Christian thing, it is a remembrance of the Last Supper.\n\n&gt; [Teabing gets started:] \"Don't get a symbologist started on Christian icons. Nothing in Christianity is original. The pre-Christian God Mithras-called the Son of God and the Light of the World--was born on December 25, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. By the way, December 25 is also the birthday of Osiris, Adonis, and Dionysus. The newborn Krishna was presented with gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\n\nMithras was a sun god. There is no evidence however of him being called \"Son of God\". There was a holiday for the sun in Rome on December 25th, *natalis Invicti*. Mithras was born in a rock (somethimes as an adult) but there is nothing that says that Mithras died and got resurected. No birthdays of Osiris, Adonis and Dionysus have survived. No scripture mentions any gifts to newborn Krishna. This passage is very *Zeitgeist*y.\n\n&gt; [Langdon has to one up this:] \"Even Christianity's weekly holy day was stolen from the pagans.\" [...]\n&gt; \"Originally, Christianity honored the Jewish Sabbath of Saturday, but Constantine shifted it to coincide with the pagan's veneration day of the sun.\" He paused, grinning. \"To this day, most churchgoers attend services on Sunday morning with no idea that they are there on account of the pagan sun god's weekly tribute--Sunday.\"\n\nChristians are worshipping on Sunday, because they believe that Christ got resurrected on that day (Easter Sunday, anyone?). \n\n&gt; [All until now was only foreplay. To properly take Sophie's virginity, Teabing goes deeper:]  \"Sophie's head was spinning. \"And all of this relates to the Grail?\"\n&gt; \"Indeed,\" Teabing said. \"Stay with me. During this fusion of religions, Constantine needed to strengthen the new Christian tradition, and held a famous ecumenical gathering known as the Council of Nicaea.\"\n&gt; Sophie had heard of it only insofar as its being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed.\n&gt; \"At this gathering,\" Teabing said, \"many aspects of Christianity were debated and voted upon--the date of Easter, the role of the bishops, the administration of sacraments, and, of course, the divinity of Jesus.\"\n&gt; \"I don't follow. His divinity?\"\n&gt; \"My dear,\" Teabing declared, \"until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet... a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. A mortal.\"\n\n&gt; \"Not the Son of God?\"\n\n&gt; \"Right,\" Teabing said. \"Jesus' establishment as 'the Son of God' was officially proposed and voted on by the Council of Nicaea.\"\n\n&gt; \"Hold on. You're saying Jesus' divinity was the result of a vote?\"\n\n&gt;\"A relatively close vote at that,\" Teabing added.\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! The people voted on numerous things during the Council of Nicea. On the prohibition of self-castration for example. On the date of Easter. But not, in any way on the divinity of Jebus. Everybody agreed that Jesus was divine and no mere mortal.\n\nThe controversy of the Council of Nicea was about Arianism. To give the divine /u/smileyman [the word](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2md719/wherein_dan_brown_just_makes_up_shit_because_he/):\n\n&gt; The TL,DR is that Arianism states that Jesus is sub-ordinate to God, the Father. Jesus was created at a specific time and was not always co-existing with God the Father. This was considered a heresy at the time, as the accepted view was that God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost are all equal and co-eternal.\n\nArius was soundly defeated in the discussions and votes and to add insult to injury, legend has it that he was slapped in the face by Saint Nicholas. \n\n&gt; [Page 253: After this bullshit, the next thing is soothing my nerves: Teabing teabings on:] \"Nonetheless, establishing Christ's divinity was critical to the further unification of the Roman empire and to the new Vatican power base.\"\n\nAs at the start of this post, Brown uses \"Vatican\" as a word for \"Church\" during a time and place where it is anachronistical to do that. The Vatican in 325 is ... a hill, I guess?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3xcp7c/ken_burns_civil_war_shelby_foote_and_narrative/",
        "text": "This isn't a review, in the proper sense, of Ken Burns' great Civil War epic. I don't think anyone has the time to watch that whole thing and do a proper take down of factual and conceptual errors which, as noted here, it is often rife with. And if I'm being honest, the last time I watched the thing, it was on VHS anyways. Rather, this is a META Review, analyzing what *other people* have said on the matter. Certainly there are more reviews out there than the ones that I used, but I tried to keep it varied, just opening them up in the order that I found them rather than trying to pick and choose ones I agreed with best, but even so you will see that there are some very consistent threads across reviews.\n\nKen Burns' \"Civil War\" is certainly considered to be a masterpiece by the viewing public, but not necessarily by the academics. Earlier this year, PBS rebroadcast the series in conjunction with its 25th Anniversary, and you can find plenty of praise. One piece run by The Guardian subtitles itself \"America's Greatest Documentary\", and Newsday terms the series \"a visceral, deeply felt film on a long-distant war that lived on in hearts and minds.\" But you can also find more balanced analysis, as a number of articles focus on the enduring controversy of the series, which, in the words of the LA Times, \"has been criticized from time to time by historians who say it distorted or ignored important events\" Burns himself mostly brushes off such criticisms:\n\n&gt;\"We had a sort of dust-up in the first few years after the series: 'It didn't do this,' 'it didn't do that,'\" Burns said. \"That's music to my ears. … If you make an 11 1/2-hour film on 'The Civil War' … and people are telling you what you've left out, you just feel terrific because they're betraying their own biases. But nobody's saying, 'It's boring.'\"\n\nand goes on to state that he believes his series has done wonders to enliven teaching of a topic students might otherwise lack any interest in. Indeed, there are many papers covering the topic of how to utilize the series in the classroom as an educational tool (although to be sure, recommendations include critical analysis in most cases). But even some educators do take issue with that. Writing in Slate, James M. Lundberg, an assistant professor at Lake Forest, notes that while the enduring popularity of the film fills seats in his Civil War class, it can at times be \"*a deeply misleading and reductive film that often loses historical reality in the mists of Burns' sentimental vision and the romance of Foote's anecdotes.\"* Burns *\"performs an impressive kind of alchemy*\", \n\n&gt;Working in the soft glow of nostalgia, he manages to take a knotty and complex history of violence, racial conflict, and disunion and turn it into a compelling drama of national unity, [....] [and] perfectly calibrated to please most every constituency in the post-Vietnam culture wars.\n\nHe also raises the oft-mentioned issue of Shelby Foote, the novelist-turned-historian most famous for his three-part narrative history on the war, which itself is subject to its share of criticism. Foote especially pushes the unity narrative as Lundberg sees it, \"*[asking] us to put aside the very troubled political meanings of the Confederate Lost Cause and join him in an appreciation of both its courtly leaders and its defiant rank-and-file soldiers.\"* Foote has particularly been criticized for his archaic views on Civil War historiography, which in no small part include the marginalization of slavery as a cause in the war. As noted by Christopher Sharrett, in an interview not included in the final cut but available in the extra material:\n\n&gt;Although Foote mentions Southern concern about \"property,\" he discounts slavery as a cause of the war. Here he makes some astonishing statements. In an archival interview included with supplements in The Civil War's new edition, Foote says that slavery was \"an issue\" but was used \"almost as a propaganda thing,\" and that \"those who wanted to exploit it could grab onto it.\" He also says that slavery was \"doomed to extinction\" and that \"some plan of compensation would have worked in time .\" There is no evidence whatsoever to support these remarks, and in fact the opposite is very basic to understanding Confederate secession.\n\nFoote is controversial in his own right, and not just in association with the series (Where he, it should be noted, \"[spoke 7,653 words compared to the second highest speaker, who spoke 1,112 words\" and has '73.5' percent of all narration](http://cwmemory.com/2015/08/31/the-split-personality-of-ken-burnss-the-civil-war/)). His novels, such as *Shiloh*, and his hefty trilogy *The Civil War: A Narrative* are classics, and rightly so, but even eliding over the criticism of his work, Foote considered himself a novelist first, and an historian second - something that would make many historians probably say “no shit” given the laissez faire attitude he took towards footnotes and anecdotes in his work, to which he simply responded:\n\n&gt;I have left out footnotes, believing that they would detract from the book's narrative quality by intermittently shattering the illusion that the observer is not so much reading a book as sharing an experience.\n\nHis method, obviously, was quite in contrast to accepted historiography even at the time, and it has only aged worse. Afterall, I’ve heard it said he never met an anecdote he didn’t like, and whatever the appeal of narrative history to the general public - I love a good pop narrative now and then myself - the underlying drive behind it can be a dangerous one, both in Foote’s books as well as as we see here with Burns. It captures the imagination of the audience, but it poisons interpretation, and becomes infected by the story that the teller wishes to make of it, which necessarily separates it from an objective retelling to a great degree. George Garrett puts it well when speaking of Foote’s writing that  “*[narrative history] engages the imagination first,”* in comparison to conventional history, which fails to similarly engage, \"*forever distorted by known outcomes\".*\n\nBorn and raised in the South, while he may in theory have decried the myth of the Lost Cause, it is hard not see the story he crafts nevertheless being thoroughly infected with it by proxy if nothing else, grounded in a perspective of the war that has been mostly killed off since he was writing by newer scholarship such as McPherson or Gallagher, neither of whom would write something like:\n\n&gt;the victors acknowledged that the Confederates had fought bravely for a cause they believed was just and the losers agreed it was probably best for all concerned that the Union had been preserved.\n\nAnd although the vivid prose which is the biggest draw of the work truly does make it a piece of art, it is the same factor which detracts from the objectivity of the narrative, as many a review has noted, as in one case, “understanding and love, capturing the distinctive qualities of a Southerner [Lee] he never ceases to admire.” While perhaps rejecting the most monstrous aspects of Lost Cause sympathy, he certainly could not totally separate himself from the romantic hold that the period hold on so many, noting, for instance, on the 2001 Mississippi flag vote:\n\n&gt;I'm for the Confederate flag always and forever. Many among the finest people this country has ever produced died in that war. To take it and call it a symbol of evil is a misrepresentation.\n\nHe ‘laments’ how the educated members of Southern society, *“allowed white supremacists to misuse their flag”* as a symbol of hate in the 1960s in his talks with the author Tony Horwitz, but seems to lack anything approaching a nuanced perspective of the issue, which Grace Elizabeth Hale notes is a sad irony, since as a young man, his published correspondence with the writer Walker Percy demonstrated a “*much more nuanced and critical stance toward segregationists*” during the 1950s and ‘60s, which he seems to have lost in his old age, describing the Freedom Riders now as having “odd haircuts and strange baggy clothes”, and giving what she sums up as a “*peculiar take on Civil War remembrance”*.\n\nTo return to the main topic at hand, the series has its boosters when addressing whether it leans too close into \"Lost Cause\" narrative however, and whether it is brushing over the centrality of slavery even if Foote might like to. Summarized in the LA Times, Joan Waugh, an historian at UCLA, *\"sees the Burns film as a valuable part of a cultural trend that has placed the battle over slavery and emancipation as key to understanding the Civil War [and] along with the Oscar-winning film \"Glory,\" countered those interpretations by putting slavery — America's \"original sin,\" as some have called it — front and center in talking about the conflict and its aftermath.\"*\n\nBut being right in some of the broad strokes isn't enough if we are looking at the series academically. Writing in \"Cinéaste\", Christopher Sharret cuts into the documentary pretty deeply, *\"put[ting] the breaks on such unthinkable enthusiasm [for the series].\"* Calling it 'CliffNotes' for the Civil War, and again harping on the specter of Mr. Foote, Sharret finds that Burns: \n\n&gt;perpetuates errors, and repeats canards that reinforce dangerous notions about the politics of race, and slavery's connection to the war. At its very worst, Burns ignores the work done by the best historians of the Civil War, preferring instead to fill big chunks of the show with wistful images of empty battlefields at the magic hour, and the ruminations of a popular raconteur.\n\nSimply put, Sharret has a laundry list of issues to raise, from nitpicks:\n\n&gt;He says that Confederate General William Mahone was \"unsuspecting\" just before the horrendous Battle of the Crater during the siege of Petersburg, when a Pennsylvania mining engineer suggested burrowing under rebel lines. In fact, Confederates well knew that something was going on, and began several countertunnels in an attempt to intercept the Union activity.\n\nto broader strokes, especially the use of \"Great Man\" history for figures such as Robert E. Lee, who is *\"venerated not only as a great general but also as a pious, thoughtful man.\"* And of course, to again return to Foote, Sharret rhetorically asks why the novelist, whose great work was decades in the past and considered quite out of date, was favored over leading scholars such as Gary W. Gallagher or  James McPherson, and whose work - perhaps the best respected in Civil War historiography - seems not even to have been utilized at all, in favor of more outdated material. Foote pays lip-service to 'rebuke' of the \"Lost Cause\", but Sharret is hardly alone in saying that his perspective on the war is nevertheless infected by it, evidenced by his thoughts on slavery as noted earlier, or his unending praise for \"*the most man in the world\"*, Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nWhile Sharret does seem in agreement with Waugh that slavery is given coverage, he disagrees whether it is as fullthroated as Waugh seems inclined to assert\":\n\n&gt;Burns introduces slavery early in the documentary, but we get little of the sectional tensions that began dividing the nation at least since the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Burns's narrator David McCuÜQugh intones: \"What began as a bitter dispute over union and states' rights ended as a struggle over the meaning of freedom in America.\" This assertion plays into Lost Cause interpretations of the conflict. The only \"state right\" (a term that popped up repeatedly during the South's prosegregationist fight against the civil rights movement) seen as threatened by the South was the right to maintain and expand the slavocracy - all other complaints were subsidiary.\n\nSharret sees one driving factor to most-likely be the market, a view that ties in with the reconciliation narrative mentioned earlier by Lundberg. Simply put, to have broad appeal, Burns couldn't just say \"*that the Confederacy was a retrograde, white-supremacist nation that, far from extolling individual rights, was extremely totalitarian even to white.\"*From a business perspective, and from the perspective of a producer creating media, perhaps that can fly, but clearly when looking at the Academic perspective, it is a poor cop out to say the least.\n\nSharret though is writing with two decades of hindsight, on the occasion of the 150th Anniversary of the War. Let's jump back to some earlier reviews, such as Ellen Carol DuBois writing for 'The American Historical Review' in 1991. She certainly gives it the due praise deserved by *\"a twelve-hour documentary that draws the largest audience in the\nannals of public television\"*, and notes the effective and well done technique of the segments. But when it comes to the 'serious history', her view is that Burns absolutely falls short, mostly bluntly, because \"*Burns never acknowledges that a historical event, certainly one of such epochal significance, will of necessity be interpreted, not only in different but in conflicting ways.*\" I feel this again falls into the same vein we saw earlier, with the reconciliation narrative finding pride of place - \"*luxuriant on military detail and very thin on political context*\" - and of course, once again a nod to Foote in this regard, peddling his tales and anecdotes *\"of the invasion and defeat of the South, an episode in American history that is ultimately tragic and a tragedy that is overwhelmingly southern.\"* \n\nIn 'American Studies International', Kevin Conley Ruffner offers his take that same year, following a similar pattern again. Calling it \"one of the finest documentaries in television history\", he notes that the \"straight-forward account\" and use of wartime accounts create an effective piece, but we are basically rehashing complaints at this point, with a few minor nitpicks mentioned, but once again, \"*The most disappointing aspect of the series is its lack of perspective on the causes of the war\"*, and while not discounting slavery, if anything Ruffner has \"the impression that the war was simply over slavery predominates throughout the program\", it is treated simplistically and without much nuance, such as the 1820 Compromise or the fight over westward expansion of the institution.\n\nTo jump to more in-depth perspective, Gabor S. Boritt, takes a much more rosier view, calling the recently debuted series “a major contribution to how Americans perceive this central event of their history - indeed war in general.” The words, images, and sounds combine into a stirring piece of work. Whereas much of the aforecited reviews criticize the “unity” narrative, Boritt seems less concerned, amused by accusations that the film carries “anti-Southern prejudice” when to him, *”the filmmaker's love of both Southerners and Northerners shines through everywhere. Much of this nation is ready for such an approach to the past.”*\n\nBut nevertheless, he does also see problems in approach, especially the lack of “*sytematic look at the home front, women, social history in general, religion, diplomacy, cultural, intellectual, constitutional and economic questions,”* which would be expected for a serious work of history. Plenty of factual errors are noted, such as mislabeled photographs or misattributed quotes (and his notes, he himself is quoted at one point “without attribution”). It shows a lack of thoroughness to Boritt, who notes Burns *“badly needed [an] outside expert to carefully comb through all of the footage for errors.”* All in all his perspective seems best summed up by his statement following several paragraphs noting what was done *wrong* about the Battle of Gettysburg (his own focus):\n\n&gt;And yet, after spitting out what to many must seem malicious quibbles (who cares whether General Armistead rode a horse?) it is joyous to shout that the Gettysburg segment, like the film as a whole, is miraculously good art. Chamberlain, and Pickett, and Burns do make the battle come alive. And more.\n\nSo really, it isn’t that Boritt was watching a whole different documentary than the others, but more that he was willing to forgive license taken and concepts truncated, and instead accept it for the artfully down series that it is, and also the renewed engagement with the history of the war that it brought for millions.\n\nBut is that engagement worth it? Writing in 1992, Jane Turner Censer sees merits to both sides in her article on utilizing the series as a classroom aid, but certainly is heavy on the criticism when she states:\n\n&gt;[a]lthough \"The Civil War\" is technically superb, the teacher of American history and culture may find its interpretations disappointing, with significant weaknesses for the classroom, despite its strengths. \n\nOne of the overriding criticisms, I’m sure you can guess at this point. She notes the often similar perspective of Burns to that of the 19th century historian James Ford Rhodes, who while giving slavery a central place in his take on the conflict, “*received great praise for its impartiality and role in reconciling North and South”*, in no small part since “*he did not blame individual slaveholders -much less all Southerners for the war and even praised valiant Southern military leaders (especially Lee).*” And while it might not be full on “Lost Cause” talking points, the Rhodes perspective certainly did little to assault that concept either, easily feeding the romantic view of the war held by both Northern and Southern supporters that dominated the narratives of the war through the mid-20th century - and of course affects Foote a great deal, as mentioned previously. \n\nThe pains and failures of Reconstruction are mostly elided over as Burns focuses on “reconciliation and brotherhood”, and the underlying implications Censer sees here are pretty large:\n\n&gt;But [Burns’] interest in celebrating may also lead him to evade difficult questions about America's past and future, especially in regard to questions of race. By making the war hinge on slavery in its narrow sense, as a moneymaking legal institution, he can allow the Civil War largely to solve the problems. Both of the sections then can appear favorably in the War: the North, because it turned to the destruction of slavery, the South because of the valor of its soldiers. With the fever of \"secessionitis\" and the economics of slaveholding seen as the cause of the war (rather than a more general proslavery ideology), he can present valiant Southern soldiers presumably fighting for their homes and their honor, not in defense of slavery and white supremacy. \n\nOf course, you can’t please everyone, and she notes the irony that while many historians criticize the series for not being tough enough, “*the series brought forth voices that, in contrast to my own perspective, argue that Ken Burns insufficiently lauded Southern leaders and soldiers and overly blamed the South for slavery.*”\n\nIn the end, whatever the strengths Censor sees for use in the classroom are quite tempered. Images are “invaluable” as a tool for immersing students in the topic, but while *”’The Civil War’ is a dazzling use of images, but its importance both as an interpretation of the war and as a teaching aid is limited by its insistence on retaining visual beauty rather than tackling difficult questions.”*\n\nI will close out by looking at *Ken Burns's The Civil War: Historians Respond*, edited by Robert Brent Toplin, but being doubly META by looking at reviews of it! This nine essay collection was published in 1996, giving voice to both critics and supporters, with roughly three for each camp, and three characterized by Nina Silber as “*moderate*” or “*mild*”, somewhere in the middle. If you have gotten this far, we might be getting repetitious by now. Eric Foner, Catherine Clinton, and Leon Litwack lead the charge against the series, focusing on, *“lack of attention given to African Americans, women and postwar problem”* as well as *“objecting not simply to the film's inability to \"cover\" Reconstruction but to Burns' decision to present the end of the war in terms of (white) sectional unity, virtually ignoring the legacy of racial triumphs and setback”.* Rebuttal is given by Geoffrey Ward, C. Vann Wodward (A consultant for the film) and Burns himself, citing “the various black faces and black voices which appear throughout the film”, but as Silber sees it, not doing much to address deeper concerns about interpretation or engagement with the meat of the issues. She additionally finds Burns to be quite *\"ungenerous*” when he uses the old ‘they are jealous of my success’ defense, which she terms “*the coward’s way out*”. \n\nA sentiment shared by J. Matthew Gallman, who finds both Burns and Ward to be *”distressed and bitter”*. Gallman doesn’t doubt the sincerity of their conviction to the work they produced, but he feels that it at times blinds them to what their critics state. He also seems slightly put off by Burns “*again (and again and again)*” harping on the five years of work he put into the project, and constant comparisons to Homer.\n\nIn his own review,  Frank E. Vandiver is much less critical of Burns’ rebuttal, “strik[ing] back effectively in pointing out the problems inherent in a new medium, especially in the concoction of committee history”*. While he agrees with the critics that there are flaws to the work, especially the point raised by Gallagher regarding the general lack of political context regarding problems faced and civilian control of strategy, Vandiver sees irony in the words of Litwack when he writes *\"it is not enough for historians and filmmakers to impart the facts. It is incumbent upon them to make people […] see and feel those facts in ways that may [...] even disturb the peace\"* since the film seems to have just that and “*involved new generations in my favorite subject”.*\n\nLess generous is Kenneth H. Williams, who contrasts Woodward’s response that “Burns should be judged not as a scholar but as an artist” with Gallagher’s retort that “many parts of *The Civil War* betray, curiously, an ignorance of modern scholarship”, not only an attack on the film, but also the scholar (Woodward) who consulted for it! When Williams does take the critics to task, such as questioning Litwack’s argument, which seems weak when compared to the interviews with Barbara Fields whose views he seems to echo, it isn’t strong, since in inturn sees Litwack’s statement that “*a film about the civil War, or any other historical subject, should not simply reinforce what Americans already know about their past*” to be perhaps the most on-point barb at the film. The biggest failings of the critics that he sees is that they simply ignore the success of the film, and are caught up in myopia and pedantry. The film was, obviously, intended for a non-academic audience, and while they can focus all they want on what was missing, it might be more productive, to Williams, to consider what could be done better for future engagement.\n\nThis is further captured by David W. Blight who provides a brief portrait of Burns, who is quoted stating he approached the project “*essentially with my heart, to feel my way to a kind of truth for myself of how this material should be structured and presented,”* and notes that one can easily feel sympathy for the auter, who set out to create art, only to have it nitpicked by historians, despite the fact that to have met their standards “*would hardly have animated those millions of viewers captured and moved by this film for several evenings”.* Ward, the scriptwriter,also attempts a defense based on medium:\n\n&gt;[He] pleads for understanding from his fellow historians about the demands of the medium of film and wishes for less \"recrimination\" in the criticism of this film's interpretation. He describes the wide divergences between popular and scholarly criticisms of the film, a point that should temper how all of us respond to history on film.\n\nBlight doesn’t buy it. He finds Ward to be “simply lame” in many of his responses, and to often miss the point of various criticisms. Blight feels that *all* of the defenders miss out, intentionally or not, on using the most obvious defense, “*admitting that this was a film driven by a central story-the drama of the war itself and its most appealing individual characters--as well as by a particular vision of the whole of American history.”* But they don’t, attempting to defend both as a medium *and* as a presentation of history. Especially, Blight sees Burns as inviting the critics by refusing *not* to take the “*mantle of a historian*”, even if an amateur one, and insisting “*[w]e, as filmmakers, had no set agenda\".*\n\nPerhaps most awkwardly, to Blight, is when Burns takes on social history, “*a ‘tyranny’ over the past, ruining the public's taste for a history*”, and praises his own storytelling, ‘rescuing history from the academy’. While I think it hard not to see a grain of truth to his words, narrative history certainly is more easily grasped by the general public, Blight finds Burns to be somewhat blustering in his criticism, *“often seem[ing] unaware of just how much the greatest of social historians still model some of the great narrative historians when they sit down to write*.” \n\nThe criticisms that Blight focuses on from the various essays are quite apparent by now, I think, but to be fair, Blight also notes that, while perhaps the most critical of the essayists, Gallagher nevertheless has praise for Burns’ “*ability to fire the imaginations of millions of Americans, sending them in large numbers to libraries and bookstores”*, and that Clinton, another critic, admits “*that historians owe Burns a ‘debt of gratitude’ for helping expand the audience for the books they write”.* But whatever the limited praise given there, Blight agrees with the critics, for the most part, in their overall position, closing out by noting:\n\n&gt;The \"epic\" that Burns sought to tell is this \"family drama,\" rooted in a Whiggish scheme of history and an Americanized sense of tragedy that requires, not only catharsis, but progress and happy endings. We all have agendas; Homer did, and so does our Homer with a camera. \n\n---------\n\nSo, I think that this paints a fair overall picture of the reception of Ken Burns’ work on The Civil War. No one can context that it was amazingly successful, and for the most part, its critics are able to praise the artistry of the endeavor. But while some might go so far as to say that it has value by bringing *a* history of the war to an audience that otherwise might not have been exposed, there is almost a universal strain of condemnation present in the academic reception of the work, focused most especially on the narrative decisions of Burns, and Foote as well. \n\nTo be sure, some Neo-Confederate believe that it was *too* harsh on the South, while more academically minded decry it as being too light. If anything, I would venture that this illustrates the problem. The series offers up an overall simple narrative, one, as we have seen over and over, of reconciliation and nationhood, and in doing so ignores so much of the work done in the decades leading up to its release, instead relying on the more romantic and traditional narratives that were by then being eclipsed. And while I am understanding of the fact that it is a documentary intended for mass, public consumption, and that it maybe wouldn’t have had nearly the success it did if it delved into the nuance that the critics as pining for, that doesn’t mean that the critics in academia are wrong, and I think their complaints gain credence especially when contrasted with the post-release attempts at defense by Burns and his compatriots.\n\n-------\n\nWorks Cited:\n\n[Ken Burns's The Civil War: America's greatest documentary rides again by Jordan Hoffman](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/04/ken-burns-the-civil-war-americas-greatest-documentary-rides-again), The Guardian, Sept. 4, 2015\n\n['The Civil War' review: PBS revives and restores Ken Burns' hit series](http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-civil-war-review-ken-burns-hit-series-revived-restored-on-pbs-1.10806356), by Verne Gay, Newsday, Sept. 7, 2015\n\n[Ken Burns' 'Civil War' returns to PBS amid a national debate over race](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-ken-burns-civil-war-20150905-story.html), by Scott Collins, LA Times, Sept. 5, 2015\n\n[Thanks a Lot, Ken Burns](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/06/thanks_a_lot_ken_burns.single.html), by James M.

        "text": "Hi everybody, first time posting here, but this really got my goat. \n\n\nSpaceflight history being a passion of mine, I’ve come across some that believe in the “Lost Cosmonauts Theory” in which the Soviets, sometime during the 1960s sent up cosmonauts, who didn’t make it back for whatever reason.\n\n\nThis is pretty solidly debunked overall and the previous mystery around the secretive Soviet Space Program has dropped over the last 20 years or so since the collapse of the USSR. \n\n\nHowever, Reddit as always, loves a good theory without evidence and usually likes to post this sort of thing. This time it’s about the [N1 Soviet lunar rocket](http://i.imgur.com/ZF6CNps.jpg). \n\n\nToday however, someone has decided to allude to the fact that maybe the N1 rocket was manned during its flight. [Link](https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3x7tv2/the_abandoned_emergency_cavern_under_apollo/cy2qyzs?context=10000) \n\nThe N1 rocket was the lunar rocket of the Soviets  designed for a [lunar landing](http://www.starbase1.co.uk/pages/N1-Galleries/Lander/slides/alk01.jpg)  and was one of the largest rockets ever designed, up there with the Saturn V for [scale and sheer power](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/N1%2BSaturn5.jpg) (thought it differed with the Saturn V in some respects). The N1 rocket was launched 4 times during its short life and [blew up shortly after take off each time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m79UO4HOQmc) on each and eventually, the program was canned and focus shifted to the highly successful space station program of the Soviets.\n\nNow this is plainly silly to say it might have been launched manned. Certainlly the Soviets, whilst they maybe didn’t place such a strong emphasis on safety (as the launch of Soyuz 1 clearly shows) as the Americans, were plainly not stupid enough to use a manned mission on the very first flight of a rocket.\n\nAnd yes, the Soviets tended to keep things under wraps more than the Americans, but it wasn’t a massive secret keeping organisation that carries on till today. The fact is that these 4 launches took place after the launch of Soyuz 1, in which Vladamir Kamarov perished. After his death he was awarded medals and granted a state funeral, and a grave spot in the [Kremlin Wall](http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2011/03/17/komarov_funeral_custom-863499cd066f8cd4d7e6060526aa20be4a1a3501-s900-c85.jpg). Not a really good cover up there\n\nAfter the N1 rocket explosion, the deaths of Soyuz 11 were also publicised. Which makes for 2 events bracketing the entirety of the N1 launches and neither of these were covered up.\n\n\nBut many of the commenters act like it’s some secret that the Russians (separate to the Soviets mind you) have decided to keep covered up even 20 years after the end of the Cold War. Never mind the fact we have great access to the archives of the Russian space program, that we have endless interviews and accounts from cosmonauts and engineers who have never mentioned anything like this, it’s obvious that we can never “truly” know…\n\n\nSorry if this went on too long, it’s just annoying. It’s not even something of nuance, it’s just facts. I’m quite happy to answer questions on this, there’s a lot more very interesting things about the Soviet space program and perhaps focusing more positive things would be good for me",

This was an era when the Rockefeller Foundation would [fund a German eugenics program](http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/1796) (including a young Mengele!).

Best sellers proclaimed \"….as long as the dominant imposes its will on the servient race, and as long as they remain in the same relation to the whites as in the past, the negroes will be a valuable element in the community, but once raised to social equality their influence will be destructive to themselves and to the whites.\" This atmosphere, unsurprisingly, wove the idea that without the paternalistic protection of white society, survival of the fittest would naturally winnow down the black population. Du Bois rejected this notion:\n\n&gt;If all authority is stripped from a people, their customs interfered with, their religion laughed at, their children corrupted, and run, gambling and prostitution forced upon them such a proceeding will undoubtedly kill them off, and kill them quickly. But that is not survival of the fittest it is plain murder. Turning then, to the second possible future of the Negro in America namely that he may die out it must be candidly acknowledged that this is quite possible.\n\nLook, I know what you're thinking, which is \"I'm not racist, but just because Du Bois didn't believe that black people were so genetically inferior as to die out naturally, and just because he suggested the mass extermination of African-Americans was a possibility, doesn't mean he didn't think they are just kinda just mildly genetically inferior and predisposed to crime. Perhaps he was a secret upper middle class white person/redditor.\" \n\nIt turns out that he was not. In *The Philadelphia Negro*, his sociological study of the Philadelphia negro, he lays out his thoughts on the cause of criminality in the black population and humanity in general:\n\n&gt;Throughout the land there has been since the war a large increase in crime, especially in cities. This phenomenon would seem to have sufficient cause in the increased complexity of life, in industrial competition, and the rush of great numbers to the large cities. It would therefore be natural to suppose that the Negro would also show this increase in criminality and, as in the case of all lower classes, that he would show it in greater degree. \n\n&gt;Moreover, in the case of the Negro there were special causes for the prevalence of crime : he had lately been freed from serfdom, he was the object of stinging oppression and ridicule, and paths of advancement open to many were closed to him.\n\nHis argument here and elsewhere is predicated on the idea that history and environment matters when trying to understand social phenomenon. Du Bois was also firmly against mainstream eugenicist who used the \"objectivity\" of science to prove their racism. Here he is in *Heredity and Public Schools*:\n\n&gt; \"It is an unproved and to all appearance an unprovable thesis that the physical development of men shows any color line below which is black pelt an above the white.\" \n\nSo no. W.E.B. Du Bois did not have the same view as that one dude's parents.\n \nInterestingly, Du Bois did believe in the part of the eugenic that said human stock could be improved through selective breeding and that certain intraracial groups were genetically less fit. This was not so unusual among prominent black thinkers of the era - A. Phillip Randolph, Chandler Owen, James Weldon Johnson and even Du Bois second arch-nemesis, Marcus Garvey, were all proponents of some sort of eugenics. Not only did he believe that his \"talented tenth\" - the top 10% of educated and wealthy blacks - were genetically superior to the \"submerged tenth\", he thought that the African American community should start \"breeding for an object . . .for brains, for efficiency, for beauty.\" Du Bois was clearly a man of his era in this regard and it should be said that his views on the fitness or unfitness of groups of people was no more provable than those of his white counterparts. \n\nFinally, a word of warning. Don't read the rest of the thread. It's filled with Necromancers who have raised Martin Luther King from the grave and received his thoughts on modern politics. Amazingly, Zombie King, despite being dead for almost 50 years, agrees with the average redditor on everything. \n\n_____\nShit I skimmed for relevant information\n_______\nDu Bois, W. E.

        "text": "When one is under the whip of Walmart during the night shift, often one's truest salvation is found in the process of participating in a healthy round of shitposting on /r/4chan, where we begin today's adventure. I was relieving my agony in the comment section of [a /pol/ or /b/ post](https://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3wwl6p/germanon_watches_a_trump_rally/) about the awful toupee-wearing news headline Donald Trump, which inevitably gave way to Hitler comparisons/apologia. I made a greentext response to a comment about how well Nazism had gone for Germany pointing out the opposite, and shortly after found myself facing a bizarrely fresh angle of Hitler apologia, beginning with this comment.\n\n\n&gt; *'Russia was never the biggest enemy. It was always France. The relation to Russia were actually always relatively nice, because both had interest in destroying Poland.*\n\n&gt; *Operation Barbarossa was purely pragmatically.'*\n\n\nHis claim that Russia wasn't the biggest enemy apparently was because France and Germany were historic enemies, not Russia. True that those two have had historical axes to grind against one another so long that by the end of WWI there was barely any blade left, but during WWII it's ridiculous to say that the USSR wasn't Nazi Germany's big prize, given that it was their stated primary focus and the concentration of most of their fighting in the whole war.\n\n\nNow another comment down he defended his claim of a pragmatic Operation *Barbarossa*. \n\n\n\n&gt; *'Like said, it was pure pragmatism. They have land, we want land, no hard feeling.'*\n\n\nI pointed out that pragmatic war doesn't usually involve ethnic cleansing, and got [this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3wwl6p/germanon_watches_a_trump_rally/cy0sw2l)\n\n\n\n&gt; *'... you've to understand that Hitler wasn't thinking in stuff like \"people\" but more geostrategically/racial. Prussia had problems with polish uprisings. Austria-Hungary collapsed due to Minorities. Exterminating was a sure way to keep the land that you've conquered. It was pure pragmatism, or do you hate animals just because you want their meat?'*\n\n\nWhat the what? When Hitler drew up plans for the mass-extermination of Jews and Slavs, he was thinking pragmatically? Pragmatic thinking of course, being a sort of practical and realistic thinking to solve problems. And I am highly skeptical that any pragmatic thinker would look at the problem of restless and troublesome minorities and conclude that [***killing them all***](http://i.imgur.com/g32M8gr.jpg) is the most logical and practical way to solve the issue.\n\n\nNot to mention that if you read any of what Hitler or his propagandists wrote, it's rather evident that they didn't view the Slavs/Jews/Roma/ as just some troublesome people. To quote *De Untermenschen*, a pamphlet mass-printed and edited by Himmler, \n\n\n&gt; *\"Just as the night rises against the day, the light and dark are in eternal conflict. So too, is the subhuman the greatest enemy of the dominant species on earth, mankind. The subhuman is a biological creature, crafted by nature, which has hands, legs, eyes and mouth, even the semblance of a brain. Nevertheless, this terrible creature is only a partial human being.*\n\n\n&gt; *Although it has features similar to a human, the subhuman is lower on the spiritual and psychological scale than any animal. Inside of this creature lies wild and unrestrained passions: an incessant need to destroy, filled with the most primitive desires, chaos and coldhearted villainy.\nA subhuman and nothing more!*\n\n&gt; *Not all of those who appear human are in fact so. Woe to him who forgets it!\nMulattoes and Finn-Asian barbarians, Gipsies and black skin savages all make up this modern underworld of subhumans that is always headed by the appearance of the eternal Jew.\"*\n\n\nAnd do I really have to explain why when you're imprinting your civilians and soldiers with sort of mindset, in addition to the propagation on both Nazi and USSR sides that this was a relentless war of ideology, and your official policy is to process and exterminate these people and enslave the rest, why the Ostfront wasn't a fucking pragmatic war? Why it's probably the *least* pragmatic war I can think of?\n\n\nI shouldn't anyway.\n\n\ntl;dr a government operating in the belief that they are a semi-mythological master race working to systematically exterminate the inherent lesser races and dominate them through any and all means isn't pragmatic.\n\n\nEdit: Star Wars spoilers in that sub.

        "title": "TED-Ed makes a video about the Wars of the Roses. It's BAD-Ed.",
        "author": "AceHodor",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3x0e1w/teded_makes_a_video_about_the_wars_of_the_roses/",
        "text": "For those of you that do not know, TED-Ed is an offshoot from the TED talks series of conferences. While I do find TED's output to be pretty damn good most of the time and at the very least promotes interesting ideas, one TED-Ed video has stuck in my craw because it is just not very accurate. The video in question is called *The wars that inspired Game of Thrones*, as written by Alex Gendler and animated Brett Underhill. It is an exceedingly good example of how high animation quality does not necessarily cross over into high factual quality.\n\nYou can watch the video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjO55pKuBo4) I will be going through it bit-by-bit and analysing the parts where they stray off the beaten path. A word of warning: if the title of the video didn't tip you off, this post may cover spoilers from A Game of Thrones and may be a little confusing to those of you who haven't seen/read the series (although you totally should, as it's friggin' brilliant).\n\n**0:40** Gold star here for correctly pin-pointing the origins of the Wars as the death of King Edward III and the mangled succession he left behind. However, they fail to mention that old Eddie compounded problems by investing *waaaay* too much power into the hands of his children.\n\n**1:06** Why are they calling the supporters of the House of Lancaster the 'Lancasters'? I have never seen a historian refer to them by that name at any point. They should be called *Lancastrians*.\n\n**1:10** Same as the Lancastrians, they've referred to the House of York's supporters as the 'Yorks'. Once more, the correct term is *Yorkists*. They've also connected York with the Starks and Lancaster with Lannister. Beyond the names, neither house had much similarity with their fictional counterpart.\n\n**1:15** It's worth noting here that although the white rose was commonly utilised by the House of York, the House of Lancaster barely used the red rose ~~device~~ emblem. The name 'Wars of the Roses' was coined in the 19th century.\n\n**1:45** Another gold star for correctly stating that it was King Henry VI's weak nature that made him a poor king, not his madness, which wouldn't manifest until some time into his reign.\n\n**2:00** There's a huge chunk here about the rivalry between Margaret of Anjou and Richard of York that is woefully inaccurate. First off, York was hardly 'loyal'. He was perfectly willing to help Henry while he had the King's ear, but as soon as he was sidelined he became extremely rebellious. The second major failing of this section is the part where it claims that the Queen elevated the Dukes of Suffolk and Somerset when, in reality, it was the other way around. It was the two Dukes' idea for Henry to marry Margaret and she was extremely dependent upon them for power in the royal court afterwards. It's only when they are both killed and she bears Henry a son that she becomes the dominant force in the Lancastrian faction.\n\n**2:15** York is made out here to be a good commander criticising Suffolk and Somerset's handling of the French campaign during Henry's reign. While the two parties did disagree vociferously on the subject, York's idea of holding onto English possessions on the continent was to go on an offensive against France. This was simply impossible, something that the two Dukes recognised, leading to them trying to make peace with the French crown. Of course, the French decided to just invade anyway and wiped out England's best men at the Battle of Castillon in 1453.\n\n**2:26** It's debatable how corrupt the English crown was under the Duke of Somerset. While the crown was in severe financial trouble, this was largely a consequence of economic depression and the loss of the French territories. That didn't stop York blaming his political enemies (i.e.: Somerset) at every chance he got though.\n\n**2:35** I think they're referring to the First Battle of St Albans here, although it's hard to tell because they gloss over it completely, which is stupid because St Albans is considered to be the first battle of the Wars of the Roses. They make it sound like York turned up with his army and overawed the court into implementing his demands. What actually happened involved York and his allies committing high treason by ambushing the Royal household in St Albans, kidnapping King Henry and killing several hundred men whose only crime was defending the the person whom everyone agreed was their rightful king. \n\n**2:40** This was not the first time York became protector. After St Albans he became protector by force, before losing it. He became protector again as a consequence of intrigue during Henry's first bout of madness and only held it for a short period of time.\n\n**2:56-3:30** This is all fine. They gloss over a lot of stuff, but it's only a six minute video, so whatever.\n\n**3:30** 'Reportedly cruel' are the correct words to use here. While Edward of Westminster did seem to enjoy killing, this was not an unusual or bad trait for a Medieval king-in-waiting to have. After all, King Henry V really liked killing Frenchmen and no-one thinks he was insane, so comparing Edward to Joffrey, who was a mentally-unstable and sadistic bully is unfair. If Joff is based on anyone it seems to be a combination of the personality of King John, what with his whole mass-murder-by-starvation thing and the effeminate good looks and mental problems of King Richard II.\n\n**3:35-4:17** Generally fine, though a few minor quibbles. Firstly, George was already pretty rebellious, so it wasn't like Warwick changed the guy's mind. Also, King Edward IV's reign was hardly 'peaceful'. He launched military campaigns against both Scotland and France and severe political unrest continued, so it is not very surprising that everything fell apart when he died.\n\n**4:35-4:40** Grats to the creators for not indulging the Ricardians that believe that literally anyone other than Richard murdered the Princes in the tower.\n\n**5:20** Stating that Henry Tudor's marriage to to Elizabeth of York ended the Wars is a bit bizarre because not ten seconds later they then claim that historical wars did not have clean ends. This was true of the Wars of the Roses: Henry Tudor faced repeated rebellions and intrigues throughout his reign as the few remaining Yorkists attempted to place pretenders such as Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel upon the throne.\n\nAnd that's the end of the video! I got the impression from watching it that the creators had done some research about the subject. However, it appears that they've then bent over backwards to try and make the Wars of the Roses fit the narrative of A Game of Thrones, which is silly because George R. R. Martin clearly only used the Wars as a jumping-off point for his story.\n\n**TL;DR History video has nice graphics, wonky facts.**\n\nSources: *The Wars of the Roses* by Desmond Seward, *Late Medieval England 1399-1509* by A J Pollard, *Edward V* and *Richard III* by Michael Hicks and numerous lectures as delivered by the aforementioned Michael Hicks.",

        "text": "The problem with most Arab stuff is that, well, most of it is pretty recent stuff and runs foul of R2.  I also tend to avoid places that may give me internet brain cancer.  Unfortunately, people have been crycry lately about the lack of posts so!\n\nToday, I bring you a nice little two-liner low hanging fruit today from wonderful world of /r/worldnews that isn't BadHistory in and of itself, but has tons of bad implication history:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3wogc2/saudi_arabia_elects_up_to_17_female_councillors/cxy1i22\n\nTrigger Warning: I'm using pure internet sources that include Wiki because I'm lazy, with no access to my books.  Also, very little of what I'm going to discuss is controversial, just a quick cheat sheet compilation of information.  Frankly, this whole time period on the Arabian Peninsula is a nightmare of infighting so this is just a quick borders, battles, and bros post.\n\nThat said, let the games begin!\n\n&gt;Riyadh was taken in 1902 by a force less than 100 strong. The House of Saud has controlled it ever since.\n\nLike most historicalisity things, this requires going back a bit earlier to get a better idea of where the House of Saud came from.  Due to not wanting to write a complete thesis which will touch on a topic I want to mostly avoid (religion), I'm going to cheat and skip merrily ahead to 1744\n\nSo to start, a picture of the large First Saud state borders:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Diriyah#/media/File:First_Saudi_State_Big.png\n\nPretty big, right?  Well, focus on the little dark green bit around the city of Diriyah.  That's where we're at right now. \n\nHistorical Diriyah was a part of Riyahd province and most importantly the home of the Saudis.  1744, the Saud family decided that expansion under the guise of religion sounded pretty good, setting Riyahd as an initial goal.  Most importantly, the leader at that time Muhammad bin Saud (aka King 1), realized that direct confrontation with the Ottomans was a bad, bad idea.  Keep it regional, Ottomans didn't care.\n\n1774, the Sauds under Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad (old Saud's son, aka King 2) finally captured Riyahd and used it as a power base to spread through-out the region.  Started with the Nejd (medium green region) that borders Iraq, Kuwait, and the Gulf.  Worked out pretty well, and since there was the whole religion thing, moved on to the Hejaz.  Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad (King 2's son, aka King 3) annexed the Hejaz, killed a bunch of people, caused havoc.\n\nWhich is where they went horribly, horribly wrong.  Why?  Confrontation with the Ottomans.  You may remember the Hejaz due to cities such as \"Mecca\" and \"Medina\" which are slightly important in Islam.  Islam being that thing the Ottomans based a fairly decent amount of their reason for existence on.  it didn't fly with the Ottomans.  At all.  Even less since the Sauds proceeded to denounce the the Ottoman Sultan as an illegitimate Caliph due to . . . not controlling the two holy cities.  Oh, and they also raided up into Iraq as far as Karbala under King 2 and King 3.\n\nCue 1811 as the beginning of the Ottoman-Wahabi war in which, long story short, the Sauds got curb-stomped. Abdullah bin Saud (son of king 3, aka King 4) became king for a short time.  Diriyah was razed (destroyed), King 4 was executed after being forced to listen to music, and the remaining Sauds ran off to (anywhere but there) because the alternative was not attractive to health concious individuals.\n\nThe important part for the purpose of this write-up?  Diriyah was destroyed.  Kaput.  Nothing left.  Gone.  Wiki quote \"In 1818 the army entered Dar'iya and after a six month siege penetrated the defenses on the Turaif, totally destroyed the houses and cut down every tree in the palm groves.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diriyah#Post_1400\n\nSkipping ahead to 1821, the Ottomans lost interest in the region again because Mecca and Medina were firmly under control, Sauds came back in and grabbed . . . Riyadh.  Which they decided to call home.  Because of Diriyah being a slightly uninhabitable pile of rubble.  And proceeded to tone it down for a bit because fuck it we're home. Netflix n chill 2nite brah.\n\nSO!!!\n\nThen the Sauds lived happily ever after in Riyahd until they decided to stop paying taxes to the Rasheed family (Ottoman flavor of the month in the Nejd, which claimed a lot of area the Sauds aka Second Saudi State claimed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Nejd#/media/File:Second_Saudi_State_Big.png vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidi_dynasty#/media/File:Alrasheed_hail_english.png) and got curb-stomped out of the Nejd again after the Battle of Mulayda in 1891.\n\nAnd now we're up to 1902 \"Battle of Riyahd\" in which the Sauds went back to the place they'd called home for a few generations, which was also the focus of their power base.  They killed the Rasheed ruler and became the hometown heroes returned, took advantage of general dislike towards the Ottomans (which is way too complicated for this), and proceeded to expand into the current Saud Kingdom in a few decades with the help of the Brits.\n\n**ELI5 speak:** Saudis claimed a lunch table at school with their friends. Expanded their control to another table, were assholes, got beaten up by bigger kids (Ottomans, who were bigger assholes), lost their original table. Came back a bit later because fuck it come at me bro. Didn't give up their milk, got beaten up again, came back with friends bigger than the Ottomans, and then ruled the lunchroom because now they were the big kids.\n\n**TLDR;** Riyahd belonged to the Sauds for quite a while and things just went back and forth.\n\nAfterword: I feel really bad about this sloppy and cursory write-up, but it's a damned complicated section of time with a lot of moving parts.  Doing it any justice without turning it into a small book is difficult.\n\nEdit: Formatting.",

        "text": "[In response to the recent post about the US' death toll, here's one specifically breaking down the Bush contribution.](http://www.communitycurrency.org/BushCrimeFamily.html)\n\nR3/R5: This is a conspiracy theory about 20th century history, but per R3 I'm exploring the shitty ideological history behind it. I'm also excising the R2 material. Consider this therefore an abridged skim of what's wrong with it.\n\n&gt;Henry Ford, founder of Ford Motor Company, once stated there are two classes of financiers: 1) Those who prit from war and use their influence to bring about war for profit, and 2) “constructive” financiers. Ford Motor Co., along with about 100 other major U.S. banks and corporations, belongs to the first group (see C. Higham’s Trading with the Enemy). Indeed, Ford himself was actually decorated by the Nazis for his service to Nazism. \n\nRight there, that is ironic. Henry Ford may have traded with the Nazi regime, but he first and foremost was a carmaker and likely used that quote to separate himself from warmongers and profiteers. Anti-Semitism and armed conflict were small parts of his business plan.\n\n&gt;Other prominent international banking families that simultaneously bankrolled Hitler, Stalin, and Roosevelt during the first half of the 20th century include the Rockefellers (Standard Oil Company, Chase Bank), the Rothschilds, the Schiffs, the Warburgs, and the Bushes, among others. \n\nJust as a sample, it doesn't look like [the Warburgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_family) had many relations with the Nazis; there were some business ties with IG Farben prewar, but the Jewish origins of the Warburgs would've excluded them (and the Rothschilds and the Schiffs) from business with the Nazis. Interestingly, the point about American capitalists doing business with Stalinist Russia [is in fact true, although not necessarily in these cases. That's more Koch brothers stuff.](http://exiledonline.com/a-peoples-history-of-koch-industries-how-stalin-funded-the-tea-party-movement/)\n\n&gt;Among the most pro-active implementers of this centuries-old project to establish a one-world government are the Bush family, two of which have risen to become U.S. presidents. A brief summary of their major accomplishments should be sufficient to indicate that their activities constitute the highest crimes against the people of the United States and humanity. \n\nAncient conspiracy with no sources. Hmm, skip because R3.\n\n&gt; III. George Herbert Walker (George W. Bush’s other great grandfather): Wall Street banker and director or president of G.H. Walker and Co., J.P. Morgan and Co., Guaranty Trust Co., W.A. Harriman and Co., and Union Banking Corporation. \n\nBorderline R2, but it's pretty anachronistic to be referring to someone who wasn't born into the Bush family as \"a Bush.\" \"A Bush-in-law\", maybe. Also, math error in that most people have four great-grandfathers and two grandfathers, so GHWB's \"other\" great-grandfather is ambiguous.\n\n&gt; Walker made his fortune building up the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, financing their oil, coal, steel, and manganese industries, among others. Meanwhile, Soviet army vehicles were fueled by oil pumped from Baku wells revived by the Harriman/Walker/Bush enterprise. \n\nHmm, a few wells in Azerbaijan isn't exactly \"building up the Soviet Union.\" Kind of exaggeration (warning: it gets better as the author blames the Bushes for Mao and Ho Chi Minh)\n\n&gt; Persistent reports indicate Bush was also an undercover CIA agent in the early 60’s, playing a prominent role in the “Bay of Pigs” invasion of Cuba (code name: Operation Zapata) in 1961 and probably the Kennedy assassination in 1963. \n\nThe \"Zapata\" connection is tenuous as the company Zapata was founded with that name in 1954. Zapata the company had only a [tangential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRG_Group) role in the Bay of Pigs. Ignoring the assassination stuff because R3.\n\n&gt;Four generations of Bushes have been instrumental, along with other Wall Street and international bankers, in creating and financing a series of great enemies (including the Soviets, the Nazis, Ho Chi Minh, Saddam Hussein, and Osama bin Laden). They and their international business partners, which typically include enemy leaders, have reaped tremendous profits from the wars they have orchestrated. The Bushes have been intimately involved in all the most profitable businesses, including banking (usury), energy (oil), sales of illicit drugs, and weapons/intelligence. Three generations of Bushes have been involved in America’s most elite secret society, Yale’s Skull and Bones, which many believe to be Satanic. The “Great Plan” which they have been working so hard to usher in calls for the destruction of the United States of America as a sovereign nation and the establishment of a “New World Order”, effectively a “Fourth Reich of the Rich.” Thus, they are all guilty of the highest crimes against humanity and the American people. \n\nWait, *Ho Chi Minh*? What does he have to do with anything? I know that the Walker side of GHWB's family was involved in some lucrative oil drilling in Baku, but you're going to blame them for Stalin and Ho Chi Minh? The Satanism, secret societies, and NWO matter is all conspiracism so I'm R3ing it (although note: [Fourth Reich of the Rich is an anti-Semitic buzzword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Reich_of_the_Rich)).\n\nOh, it gets better:\n\n&gt;Rough tally of humans killed by the New World Order so far: \n\n&gt;Chinese killed by Mao Tse Tung\n&gt;100 milllion\n\nWhat, are they just pulling dictators out of a hat and saying \"okay, this guy was either a commie or a fascist so he's the ~~Bushes'~~ NWO's fault\"? Also, nice shifting from the Bush family to the NWO.\n\nWe've already seen the Black Book of Communism and the [Black Book of Yankee Imperialism](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3vy7kv/the_united_states_has_killed_10s_of_millions_of/), here's the Black Book of Bushwhacking.",

Calder conceded that although the Tasmanians \"were great flesh-eaters\" they were \"not cannibals, and never were.\" This person's views towards the Tasmanians must be some 200 years old.\n\n* [The Tasmanians are increasingly believed to have known how to make fire.](http://press.anu.edu.au//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ch0155.pdf) \n\n* The wheel was invented twice or three times in the entirety of human history, and it is ridiculous to fault the Tasmanians for not having it, not to mention that there do not seem to be any easily discernible reasons they would bother to make one, considering their lifestyle.\n\n\n&gt; now they have free healthcare, education, libraries, roads, welfare, and countless other shit. id say thats a good tradeoff for having their resources (copper, tin, zinc, and iron they didnt know how to mine or use) \"looted\" wouldnt you?\n\n* I simply don't know how to respond to this. The Tasmanians did not die out *per se*, but their languages and lifestyle has been virtually eradicated. Slavery and large massacres of the Tasmanian population were very much real, as were rapes on an almost systematic scale. It is not only historically inaccurate but simply offensive to insinuate that they benefited from colonialism.",

This thing is in beta, so I’m willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that stuff will be smoothed out over time and not attack it for having Germany controlling Norway in 1999. Instead, let’s examine the basic problems that result from it using EU4’s visualization of history. \n\n* Treating modern day provinces as the basis for the map, implying a greater rigidity and consistency to borders than existed in many areas at many times and a continuity of modern day borders that will be inaccurate in many cases.\n* Having wasteland provinces that imply a) that because a state did not occupy an area no one was living there and b) that the world is a stagnant place waiting to be filled by human states.\n* Using religion maps that ignore all but the dominant religion of an area, ignoring the presence of religious minorities that played a significant role in various societies. \n* Treating religions outside of the big five as broad categories like “Shamanism” or “African,” ignoring the significant differences between religious practices of different peoples across continents. \n\nThese are just the issues I can identify as a layman. I’m sure more seasoned bad historians could find far more issues with this portrayal of history.\n",

The border patrol units were selected from the most loyal and well trained East German military and police units. They were expected to not let anyone get near the wall and had full permission to shoot attempted crossers. \n\nThe third panel has the Soviet agent. The role of border defense had already been placed on the German Border Police in 1946 with the NKVD (later KGB) leaving in 1955/1956. The wall began construction in 1961. The border police were integrated into the East German army in 1961 and renamed the Border Troops of the GDR would remain the premier defenders of the wall until its collapse. The Stasi also importantly played a role as a watchdog to ensure that border guards themselves would not try to escape or allow it. They would act as enlisted Border Troops or Grenzer. \n\nFrom the comments \n&gt;Only that it was another east german guy on the tower shooting.\n\n&gt;The next picture should have been 20 years later with the shooter in front of a court saying he was only following orders (genious) -&gt; not guilty\n\nIt is true as part of the reunification plan that East German officials would not be punished for their actions. That didn't really work out so well.

The most highly fortified position was within Berlin, but the entire Inner German Boarder for 866 miles was fortified mostly with fences, anti-tank measures, and watchtowers. \n\n",

Rashid has seen that it is weaker, so they decide to attack that section instead of dying in droves along one of the stronger sections of the city walls. This coincides with the real move Saladin's army made to the north-eastern section of the walls. The reasons for that I've already outlined in Part One - Here's what really happened, but for the sake of ease, I'll [copy the map here again](https://i.imgur.com/AqvyiZ4.jpg). The second attack position would have been at the top right, with the main attack happening on the section of wall between the north-west corner tower and the next northern wall tower. Where it says \"Second Mus**lim Posi**tion on the map, the bits I made bold  was the section of the wall that was breached. In reality Saladin broke off the siege on day 4 (25th of September), packed up his siege machines, and appeared to withdraw behind the hills only to reappear on the 26th of September at the north-east corner of the city. The defenders actually hoped he had buggered off permanently, only to be cruelly surprised after the army appeared in a new place.\n\nThe film discusses a Christopher Gate that was supposed to have been here, but has been walled up. That is not an unusual thing to happen to city gates. For example today's wall has seven open gates, with three closed ones. The crusaders only had four, one on each side, one of which, the Golden Gate, is now closed. In this case though the Christopher Gate is not one of the gates that once was a gate but was walled up. The Roman Walls went much further north than the current walls do there, enclosing farms and villas. There's a fantastic scale model of Roman times Jerusalem in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, with [this shot showing the northern part of the city](http://i.imgur.com/sFQPfWR.jpg?1) (remove the ?1 part from the URL to get the full 12Mp size). \n\nThe Byzantine era walls were more similar to the crusader, and current, ones, and only had the same gates in the north and east walls that the crusader time city had. The main gate being the St. Stephen's Gate (now called the Damascus Gate) leading onto two main, fairly broad, shopping streets (cardos). There's [a model in the Tower of David museum](http://www.tod.org.il/en/timeline/byzantine-period/) showing the layout of that time. There was one more postern gate between St. Stephen's Gate and the north-east corner of the wall called the St. Mary Magdalen Gate (currently called Herod's Gate), which is roughly halfway between St. Stephen's and the NE corner. This is too far away from the actual place of the breakthrough to be the gate in question. Also it was pretty well defended and still in use at the time. The Byzantine city had a bit more land enclosed in the south with their walls, but since those walls are not being attacked, that's not relevant.\n\nSo in conclusion, there was no ex-gate in that section of the wall, and Christopher's Gate wasn't the name of a gate in Jerusalem ever insofar I've been able to figure out. What is correct is that this section of the wall was weaker than most others. It was also the place were the crusaders broke through in 1099. And even if a gate was blocked off, it wouldn't form a weaker section in the wall in most cases. Gates tend to be quite well defended with flanking towers, murder holes, and layered defences. You'd still have to deal with those, and except dealing with wooden gates, you're now facing bricked up walls. Unless there was a gate that was bricked up in a rush to reduce the number of gates that needed to be defended just before a city was about to be besieged, they're not an easy way into town. The film here needs an \"explanation\" as to why the trebuchets can suddenly break through the walls, while before they weren't doing much damage.\n\n# Day 3 - It's a New Day, It's a New Place, and Saladin's Feeling Good\n\nFor this section I have a [Youtube clip](https://youtu.be/YUKxBnSkR6U?t=339) but I'd recommend turning down the volume since someone added a musical track over it. After the required motivational speech, we kick the day off with some fresh trebuchet bombardments. This time the numbers are a bit more sensible. Despite attrition from counter attacks by the crusaders, Saladin is said to have had a large number of siege engines to cover all the walls in the NE, and focussed his efforts on the corner mentioned above. This makes sense; his engineers would have had time to cut down more timber and build more machines. \n\nIn the film we see a shot of one of the destroyed siege towers, but in reality those would have been left behind a good bit to the west (if there were any used). The ground would have been unlittered with debris, but a lot rockier and steeper than shown. There's a valley running along the east side of the walls and along the north the ground dips down before it rises again. \n\nOnce more the trebuchets are able to fling rocks at a super flat arch, which is impossible unless Saladin researched gunpowder overnight and upgraded them to cannon. Conveniently the bombardment takes just long enough to break through the wall for Balian to finish his speech, but then a super-fireball stone blows the thing up and does a fair bit of damage behind the wall as well. Far too dramatic again, I doubt even cannon would have been able to break through a wall in such a spectacular manner, but it does look cool. Both armies charge into the breech and fighting continues for the rest of the day with Balian dropping his shield at the first opportunity to use his anachronistic bastard sword two-handed. One smallish piece of bad city wall construction can be seen at [6:43 in the clip](https://youtu.be/YUKxBnSkR6U?t=403); that passage way inside the wall would have had far thicker walls on the outside part, otherwise those trebuchets would have just been able to lob a few stones into that general area and collapse the top half. A second part of bad history is shown two seconds later as we look over the shoulders of the attacking Saracens: there's another section of wall and a tower in the background. That would have been really nice for the crusaders, because then they could still withdraw to the inner walls there without losing too much of the city. Sadly for them, that's a non-existing tower, so that breach needs to be held. I can only assume that they fit in with the Minas Tirith model Scott seems to have used for the city. \n\nThat sort of wraps up the siege part. You know the ending in the film: the fighting continues, Balian goes out to negotiate, Saladin allows everyone to go (all Latin Christians, the other Christians could stay) and it's a relatively happy ending.\n\n# The End, Its Cruel Brush With Reality, and Final Notes\n\nI've already mentioned in part one what really happened. The wall was brought down by sappers, with the trebuchet only providing covering fire. The walls were under constant fire by archers as well, also to stop the defenders from trying to disrupt the sapper's efforts. The previously so successful sorties were this time stopped and defeated by the Saracen cavalry. And after the wall was breached, the defenders managed to hold it for two whole days before a surrender was agreed. The defenders were allowed to leave if they could each pay a fairly hefty ransom and they were given 40 days to find the cash. The Patriarch of Jerusalem wasn't greedy at all, he was key in freeing a lot of poor people by stripping churches of gold in order to pay the ransom for those who couldn't, so Booh on you for dragging that poor guy's name through the mud, Ridley Scott! Booh! In reality the military orders were less inclined to help out the poor with their wealth, but others tried to help out as many as possible. Balian negotiated the freedom of a bunch, and Saladin's brother managed to get more concessions. Despite their best efforts though 15,000 Latin Christians couldn't find the money and were sold into slavery. The rest were allowed to leave and departed for Tyre (what happened to these refugees later is pretty tragic as well, but that's a different story). This was not Saladin at his most magnanimous - it's hard to translate the value of a bezant from those days to current times, but chroniclers of the time complain that the ten bezant ransom per man (5 for a woman and 1 fo a child) was exorbitant. There were some additional people freed (like the elderly), or exempted from having to pay the ransom, but it was still a good chunk of the population. We know there were around 60,000 people in Jerusalem during the siege. It's not exactly clear how many of those were allowed to remain because they weren't Latin Christians, but more than one in four of the crusader refugees didn't make it out and ended up as a slave. I'd estimate the actual figure is closer to one in three.  \n\nI think that will be the last siege I cover for a bit. Like I mentioned elsewhere, films tend to take the same short-cuts for sieges, so I think it might be a bit boring to cover the same things over and over. But I'll have a look at Vikings to see if their storming of Paris is giving me enough new material to go over. Otherwise I might pick up a post-gunpowder siege in the new year and bore you to pieces with me waxing lyrically about Vauban. ",

Reason for attributing deaths include.\n\n\"broadcasts by the U.S. Radio Free Europe into Hungary sometimes took on an aggressive tone\" (hungary)\n\n\"U.S and Germany worked to convert its socialist economy to a capitalist one by a process primarily of dividing and conquering\" (Yugoslav Wars)\n\n\"The U.S. is responsible for between 1 and 1.8 million deaths during the war between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, by luring the Soviet Union into invading that nation\" (Soviet invasion of Afghanistan)\n\nOverall death numbers are greatly inflated, and conflicts where the US had little to do with, such as\n\n- India-Pakistan wars\n- Khmer Rouge genocide\n\nEven worse, the US is somehow responsible for deaths from the Sudanese civil war and Yugoslav wars despite providing large amounts of relief for Sudanese refugees, and intervened to stop ethnic killing in Kosovo. Mortality from the sanctions on Iraq are more an indictment of Saddam Hussein's brutality, as Iraqi Kurdistan experienced a decrease in Infant Mortality during the same period.\n\nThe deaths can be sorted into 6 categories.\n\n- 1 People physically killed by US military/Intelligence agencies\n\n- 2 People physically killed by factions in opposition to the US\n\n- 3 People killed in regional conflicts where the US provided support to involved factions\n\n- 4 People killed by regimes which received US support.\n\n- 5 People killed in conflicts where destabilizing actions by the US led to the conflict.\n\n- 6 People killed in conflicts where the US had minimal involvement\n\nI arrived at these approximate breakdowns, feel free to debate/correct any of them\n\n1 People killed by US Military/Intelligence/Allies. Estimates are upper bound\n\n- Bombing of Cambodia : 150,000\n- Bay of Pigs : 350 (counting cubans on both sides)\n- Invasion of Grenada : 277\n- Downing of Iran Air 655 : 290\n- Gulf War : 35,000\n- OIF &amp; Operation Inherent Resolve : 60,000\n- OEF : 40,000\n- Korean War : 2.2 million attributing all North Korean/Chinese/Soviet military+civilian casualties to the US. \n- Vietnam War : 1.8 million\n- Operation Allied Force : 1000\n\nSubtotal : 4.3 Million. Not a small number by any means, but a far cry from 25 million.\n\n2 People killed by factions in opposition to the US\n\n- Korean War : 1.2 million\n- Vietnam War : 1.7 million\n- OIF : 160,000 (includes sectarian violence)\n- OEF : 20,000\n\nSubtotal : 3 Million\n\n3 People killed in regional conflicts where the US provided significant support to involved factions\n\n- Angola-Zaire : 600,000\n- East Timor : 200,000\n- Colombian conflict : 220,000\n- Guatemalan civil war : 200,000\n- Israeli-Palestinian conflict : 21,000\n- Nepalese Civil War : 17,000\n- Nicaraguan civil war : 40,000\n- Chadian Civil war : 4000\n- Iran Iraq War : ~500,000\n\nSubtotal : 1.8 Million\n\n4 People killed by US backed regimes.\n\n- Chilean Junta : 30,000\n- Haitian Junta : 60,000\n- Marcos Regime : 100,000\n\nSubtotal : 190,000\n\nBy the strictest definition, the US was responsible for a rough upper bound of 4.3 million foreign deaths since WW2 through direct action. If the US was responsible for all deaths in all armed conflicts it engaged in, the number rises to around 8 million. If one adds in all people killed in civil wars where the US supported a side, and the repressive regimes it supported, that number is now closer to 10 million. That definition means that if an Iraqi insurgent blows himself up in a market, the deaths are attributed to the US.\n\nMake no mistake, the US has plenty of blood on it's hands, some justified, much of it not. Stretching the boundaries of \"responsibility\" to it's very limit, one can maybe reach 10 million or so, not the 25 million number stated by Mr. Lucas. More reasonable interpretations would be around the 4-6 million range.\n\nAfterward : as a number of comments point out, this is basically a reverse of \"The Black Book of Communism\", a laundry list of people supposedly killed by the US/Communism. All \"death figures\" are intensely political, and serve a goal. Be skeptical of any claims stating X people died because of Y.\n\nMost of my Numbers come from the PRIO Battle Deaths Data Set, found here\n\nhttps://www.prio.org/Global/upload/CSCW/Data/PRIObd3.0_documentation.pdf",
