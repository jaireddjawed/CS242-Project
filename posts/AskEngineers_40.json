However, if the car is in high gear, the engine will keep running even if no fuel flows through it. So would it use less fuel if you keep the gear in? Assuming the road is steep enough to make it up for all the engine friction and keep the speed constant.",

I was hoping to get help coming up with a good solution for a unique problem.\n\nI work in prosthetics, and we're seeing this person who is missing a significant portion of both of their arms. This person would like to get back into exercising, and is looking for us to put together a device for them that would help make that easier.\n\nWe're trying out a few different designs (including some to be used with exercise bands/medicine balls/etc) , and for one of them we would like to put together some kind of gripping device that would allow him to hold onto free weights like lighter dumb-bells. The problem is, as a bilateral amputee, he really doesn't have the ability to fiddle with knobs or straps like you might see in more traditional weight lifting terminal devices.\n\nI've got it in my head that it might be worthwhile to find some kind of clamp that works hands-free- As in, you can push the handle of a weight or something through it's opening and it'll mechanically ratchet or snap into place somehow so that it holds the weight securely. There would also need to be some kind of quick release tab or button that can be easily activated to let go of the handle.\n\nIn googling for something like this, I've found a couple examples of items that are similar to what I'm thinking:\n\nWedge clamps, which seem the be pushed into place until a spring pushes the wedges back to their original positions, locking the handle in place: https://www.com-ten.com/images/super/WCS0525-wedge-clamp.gif\n\nThese plate clamps which seem like a super intense version of what I'm thinking of: https://images.globalindustrial.com/images/pd/31300592.jpg\n\nThese Kolpin ratcheting rhino clamps which need to be pushed closed with another limb (Honestly probably the closest product to what I'm thinking of at the moment!): https://media-www.canadiantire.ca/product/automotive/automotive-outdoor-adventure/powersport/0271815/ratchetingrhinogrip-38409d3b-5871-4f5f-868c-ed7fa8b8c17a.png\n\nAaanyways, i get that this is kind of a weird case and maybe not the kind of thing you'd usually see on this sub, but I have faith that someone here's seen something that might bein line with what I'm thinking. We tend to use a bunch of macgyver'd tools from a variety of industries in our field, so I really appreciate any and all suggestions.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hello everyone :) Thank you for taking the time and helping me out. I don't have any real experience with creating these kinds of projects that's why I am looking for opinion if my idea could be turned into a reality or not. \n\nI took inspiration from this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhu3s1ut3wM&amp;t=209s&amp;ab\\_channel=TomStanton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhu3s1ut3wM&amp;t=209s&amp;ab_channel=TomStanton)\n\nIt would take me a lot of time to explain to you how my flywheel would work that's why I created this video: [https://streamable.com/fxoyfu](https://streamable.com/fxoyfu)\n\nIt's not very long. I am explaining how it would work and I created the model so you have an idea of what I am talking about. \n\nWhat I am asking is: Is it even possible to build it? Would it work? Would it be efficient? How much power it could produce? If the flywheel would be in a vacuum would it be more efficient?  (if somehow I would have a way to construct it :) )\n\nThank you very much :) And sorry that I sometimes stutter in the video and make some English mistakes  :D",

Our calculated value for Feigenbaum's constant was understandably miles off. But I'd like to ask if anyone understands why our circuit behaved in that way.\n\nThank you.",

It also sounds nice to be able to have vast knowledge in multiple fields instead of tightly specializing in one as I'm sure it would get very repetitive really quickly for me.\n\nThermo focus offers pretty much no electrical, programming or design classes, but mechatronics also doesn't have classes like control theory and PLCs, which I would have to self-study in case I take that path.\n\nThere's also the possibility that companies hire EEs (who also have robotics and automation classes) in positions where someone with knowledge of mechatronics could also do a great job as mechatronics isn't that widely known field yet.\n\nAny advice/experiences about each concentration would be greatly appreciated.

So my question is, how similar are these two options?

I love that both these schools are close to great skiing spots (big hobby of mine), but that also means they are smaller and therefore don't offer Aerospace Engineering. I have applied to CU Boulder, which has both skiing and AE, however I would have to pay out of state tuition which would be ridiculously expensive.\n\nAny advice or knowledge would be appreciated.
