        "text": " Hi everybody,\n\nWelcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!\n\nWe have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.\n\nWe thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!\n\nOf course itâ€™s not limited to \\*just\\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \\[read, listen to or watch\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",
