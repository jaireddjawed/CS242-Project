No matter what other thing the topic starts to change to, he brings it right back around to money. Usually about other people\u2019s money. He knows a lot of successful people and he talks all about their wealth, how much money they make, how much their houses cost. He even shows me pictures of their huge mansions and properties. He just starts whipping out these saved photos he has of other people\u2019s properties. It\u2019s been happening more and more as of late. I\u2019ve been knowing him for about 4 years. He always did this, but lately he\u2019s been (almost aggressively) dominating our conversations to what he wants to talk about (money). \n\nI\u2019ll try to change the subject and he will totally ignore what I said and keep controlling the conversation. Lately he has been going through some financial troubles, so I can understand why he\u2019s becoming increasingly obsessed with it. He\u2019s been talking about how he doesn\u2019t have much money and talks about how so and so has this but he doesn\u2019t etc. He talks about how rich his dad is and that his dad never helps him. (Then later he told me his dad is actually on a fixed income?) He talks about how good his brother has it compared to him. \n\n\nBut here is another thing: he seems to stay up really late, like into the wee hours of the morning, which means he\u2019s also sleeping in late. He has no dependents. Not married. He\u2019s a grown man. Nothing is stopping him from going out and getting a job. Or even two jobs. If he wants money so bad, he lacks the initiative to go out and try to get it. He used to provide music lessons which is how he earned his income, but lately something happened and he has to think of a new way to make income. I just don\u2019t understand why if he wants money, why he doesn\u2019t become more proactive about it instead of complaining so much and obsessing over other\u2019s success. \n\nAlso, this guy has options, if he\u2019s telling the truth. It\u2019s not like he will ever go homeless or hungry. He does have a nice rental house. It\u2019s beautiful. He shouldn\u2019t be complaining so much because he\u2019s got it better than a lot of people. \n\nI finally made a little comment, and I said, \u201cWe always end up talking about money lol.\u201d He got very insulted by that. \n\nHow do I help this 50 year old man?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678735766.0},{"title":"I tried the American Cheese in Ramen thing and did not care for it.","author":"SalMinellaOnYouTube","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CasualConversation\/comments\/11qiw8e\/i_tried_the_american_cheese_in_ramen_thing_and\/","text":"I keep seeing putting a slice of American Cheese in with your Ramen being pushed everywhere so I gave it a shot.

Or is is simply less familiarity with Indian culture? Does expressing interest in visiting India evoke strong disapproval and red flags among young people that many other countries do not?

For example you might have black shoes, trousers, blazer with a white shirt and gray waistcoat. Paired with this, a red tie and pocket handkerchief. The tie is the centrepiece of the suit, so that's where the colour. Which draws our attention to the tie and makes it pop. \n\nAnother example is a living room where the paintwork, flooring, furniture is all black, white and gray. But you might have hand drawn roses on the feature wall, rose coloured cushions on the sofa and a vase of roses on the coffee table. The minimal use of pink makes these decorations more eye catching.

I never gave up hope, and spent every second of my free time looking for him or making posters by hand because we didn\u2019t have a printer and were too poor to get posters made. On day 9 I began accept the reality that we may have separated forever. I had one friend over and it was very late into the night approaching morning, maybe 3-4am. I was smoking a joint with him while talking about life and mortality, as he was helping me cope with the loss of my homie when I started to get a tummy ache. \n\nThis tummy ache was ignorable at first, but ramped up slowly to where in about 10 minutes I couldn\u2019t ignore it or pretend I was okay. I slowly move to the ground to curl up in the fetal position because it hurt so bad, and I didn\u2019t know anything that could have cause it or alleviate it. I even thought I might be having a heart attack because I\u2019ve heard of stomach aches being an early warning sign, and this was unlike anything I\u2019ve felt before.

I say his name again and bend down way too fast and spook him away, but i as calmly as possible eventually chase him to the side of the house, and coax him into arms reach and snag him up, and bring him inside.

It was said to be a giant rodent, larger than any other species known to man, with razor-sharp teeth and a thirst for blood. This creature was known as the \"Capybara of the Night.\"  The legend of the Capybara of the Night was born from the experiences of the indigenous people who lived in the area. They claimed that, at night, they would hear strange noises coming from the forest, like the sound of heavy breathing and rustling of leaves. They also reported sightings of a large, dark shape moving through the trees.  Many villagers were afraid to venture into the forest at night, for fear of encountering the Capybara of the Night. But one brave hunter decided to face his fears and went into the forest in search of the creature.  As he walked deeper into the forest, he heard the same eerie sounds that the villagers had described. Suddenly, he saw movement in the bushes ahead of him. He raised his gun, but before he could fire, the Capybara of the Night leaped out of the bushes and attacked him.  The hunter fought for his life, but the Capybara of the Night was too strong. Its razor-sharp teeth tore through his flesh, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The creature then dragged his body deeper into the forest, never to be seen again.  After this incident, the legend of the Capybara of the Night only grew stronger. People became even more afraid of the forest, and many believed that the creature was a curse sent by the gods to punish them for their sins.  To this day, some locals still claim to hear the sounds of the Capybara of the Night in the forest at night. They warn visitors to stay away from the area, lest they meet the same fate as the hunter who dared to challenge the creature.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678348941.0},{"title":"Non-essential expenses that are totally worth it","author":"ForeignerInEurope","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CasualConversation\/comments\/11lz86g\/nonessential_expenses_that_are_totally_worth_it\/","text":"I think this is a super individual thing, but yesterday I reflected on my relationship with money, spending etc. - I'm pretty responsible with money, but I'm making less money now (by choice, mostly - prioritizing my mental health) which means I've been extra diligent with my spending. So of course, I've had to think about what's actually worth it beyond things like rent, bills etc. \n\nSo here are a few things I purchase regularly\/singular purchases I came up with that were totally worth it:\n\n* My elliptical. I got it about four years ago for around 300 euros, and damn, this thing has definitely paid itself off. Zero technical issues and I now use it at least once a week. Living in Europe, where there are more cold months than not, having a way to do cardio easily at home without making a ton of noise or hurting my knees or back has been awesome.\n* My air fryer. Honestly, best 50 euros I could have spent for my kitchen. I bought a really pretty little mini one. Never had a single issue with it, and I use it every single day. I barely even use my oven anymore. I think my loved ones are getting sick of how often I praise the damn thing.\n* YouTube Premium and Spotify subscriptions. I use both every day, multiple times a day, and the features for both are 100% worth it to me. Every time I'm with people who use the free versions, I don't understand how they tolerate it. \n* Getting groceries delivered almost exclusively. In my area, shipping is usually relatively inexpensive, and I'd rather pay and avoid the hassle, time wasting and the potential impulse purchases I do when I go in person. I have my go-to items favorited, and I add groceries throughout the week to the app to make sure I remember to buy them. Once in a while I go in person for items I can't get on there, or change up the place I order from to have more options - but on a weekly basis, this has been totally worth it. I honestly think it saves me money, because I rarely buy random shit I don't need.\n* Extra cloud storage. It syncs up everything on my computer so I never have to worry about losing precious files, which has definitely happened before. I can also easily access anything on my laptop from my phone.\n* Kindle with Kindle Unlimited. This shit SLAPS. I can get basically any book I want to read for a cheaper price and take it with me anywhere. It's light, the battery life is impressive, and dark mode is awesome at night. Plus, I have a small apartment and I don't want to clutter it with a ton of paperbacks. I love a good physical copy of a book, but realistically this has been extremely handy.\n\nWhat are some of yours?

I just felt like talking a bit about why I love music so much and what I love about it, and I\u2019d love to hear what other people enjoy most about it. \n\nFor me, I listen to music almost constantly. I refuse to have silence, especially when I can have something so amazing to listen to. I even listen to music to sleep. \n\nThere are so many amazing things about music to me. There\u2019s the emotions it makes me feel, the way it sounds, etc.\n\nI have so many playlists of songs for when I\u2019m in different moods. For example, I have a playlist for when I feel energetic, and a playlist for when I\u2019m sad, and many more for so many emotions and moods. Having your music match what your feeling is ideal in my opinion; I can\u2019t imagine listening to an energetic song while I\u2019m sad, it would just be weird. \n\nI grew up with a dad who would sing to me a lot and played the guitar, and I don\u2019t doubt that my love for music stems from him. He loves music, and while we don\u2019t really listen to the same genres, we can still agree when music is good, despite not having the same taste. \n\nI love music in many genres, like pop, alternative, indie music, and a few more, and I listen to it in all different languages. The languages mostly include English, French, and Korean, but I also know some songs in Russian, Indonesian, and a few more languages. \n\nMost people will judge you when they find out you listen to music in languages you don\u2019t understand, but is clear they just don\u2019t \u2026 feel the emotion as easily. For example, I\u2019ll usually look up lyrics for songs in other languages so I can truly understand, but even before doing that, you can sometimes feel the emotions they\u2019re trying to portray simply by listening to it. I wish people could understand that more easily and not judge me, but I also stopped caring, because as long as I\u2019m happy and able to feel good while listening to music, that\u2019s all that matters.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678266400.0},{"title":"what went on your thoughts when someone gives you food they wouldn't eat herself","author":"haha_ineedhelp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CasualConversation\/comments\/11m2bbw\/what_went_on_your_thoughts_when_someone_gives_you\/","text":"For context, I rent a room and have this landlord's childs as housemates, they live downstairs.

It felt soothing and relaxing, which was so nice after a week of having my thoughts constantly circling around work. I kept playing on\/off throughout Saturday, trying to limit myself by not buying more lives when I ran out (I think you have a reserve of 3 or 5 that replenish with time, but you can buy more with gold you collect in the game).\n\nNow, my partner kept seeing me play and wanted to try, and absolutely loved it. What ensued was that we kept alternating with who was allowed to play Candy Crush for a good part of Saturday and Sunday t (he didn't want to download it to his own phone as to not play it too much, and kept asking for my phone so that he could play \"just one or two levels\").\n\nThe scary part is that it feels like the game genuinely changed us as people. My partner seemed to not notice anything around him as long as he was playing, and both of us kept buying more and more lives because we didn't want to stop playing, even though I don't know if it was even fun after a while. We also started bickering about who would get to play to a point of actual pettiness (we don't usually fight much). It was ridiculous.\n\nIt got to Sunday night, and in the middle of another fight about who was allowed to use my phone, I said I was just going to delete the whole app to end this, which I thankfully did. Afterwards, we both realised how ridiculous it was to be so engrossed in such a pointless game app and to spend our entire weekend fighting about who gets to destroy fictional candy. It's almost a bit scary how much we wanted to be constantly playing it.\n\nJust wanted to share this odd experience.

I had been so looking forward to getting started in my career. I had an internship already lined up, I was successfully getting into all of the classes I needed, I was well and truly ahead of the game and ready to go.\n\nI found out that, due to medical reasons, I wouldn't be able to move forward. Not only in my current career path, but I probably won't be able to work in the medical field in any capacity like I wanted to.\n\nIt was incredibly upsetting, all the work and time I put in gone to waste. And it was discouraging because I had been looking forward to working in a science lab for so many years. I didn't know where to go from there. I didn't have a job as I was a full time student, and all I had were my savings from when I DID have a part-time job, which I didn't want to blow through. But I didn't let myself feel stuck for too long. I figured out a new career path and it so perfectly fits my circumstances and I'm really excited to get started.\n\nI'm taking a leap of faith and starting my journey as a freelance copyeditor and proofreader. Nearly every bit of free time I had as a student was spent reading all kinds of different stories. My friends and family knew I was a big reader so they often had me read over and correct their college or work papers. I thought, why not make something out of it? So I purchased an online course, completed it and got my certificate, practiced and practiced and practiced... and I found my first client. Granted, it was another family member and I do it for free for them since they're really just helping me hone my skills, but still. I now know for sure that I enjoy the work and I'm good at it. I also got a testimonial from a business where a friend works, which I did some free editing for!\n\nI've since created a website for my business, set up an account on LinkedIn, and made an official business page on Facebook. There's so many freelance editors out there that it's so competitive but it just feels really good to have a sense of direction after that giant loss of what I thought was my \"set in stone\" career in CLS.

So today, it's a nice, clear day, relatively warm, perfect outdoor weather. Get off of work, get my stuff, chillax at the park, clear my head a bit. Sometime later I'm about halfway through my large slushy when I notice a brown pickup truck slowly circling the park (it's sort of rectangular shaped, curved along the main neighborhood road and on the other side is a straight road, it makes a sort of D shape coming from my work), I'm talking like, 5 on a 30mph. I only really recognized him because in my dream last night (I had been contemplating it too because I literally never dream) I had been followed and kidnapped, escaped, and then got followed again ans that car had done the exact same thing basically the truck irl was doing-and both took place in my neighborhood too.\n\nI was super on edge and had been all day because I had never felt such pure horror as when I had seen the cars in my dream, so I immediately locked on to that truck, trying to reassure myself I'm paranoid. 2nd or 3rd lap, he gets passed by some car that looks like my mom's, and I'm like oh okay. Thank fuck. She's going normal speed, but turns down the straight edge of the D and parks and as the truck turns down the same way, I'm like okay no. Fuck this shit, I grab my bag and fucking book jt across the park. As I'm going through the park that truck parks and as I get to the top point, the lady who'd park rolls her window down and yells if he's following me, had been watching, had a sister in high school about my age and wanted to check on me. I was nervous but I didnt know what to do, I didn't think it'd be worth it to call the police because I was so close to my house (5-10 min walk) and this was such a safe neighborhood. I've walked home all the time in the dark it's only a 15 minute walk from work straight through the neighborhood and I encounter night runners (more often than not other women) quite frequently. So she offered to drive along side me to help me get home, I was super freaked out and I guess I was more trusting because I had thought initially she was my mom. I realize now this coild have made it worse, but she helped me get away from the main street and away from the truck and I went the last stretch alone. When I had looked back that truck had stopped at a corner for a bit and then I got out of sight and I dont know where he went. This happened about  45 minutes ago and I'm still shaking so badly. If it weren't for this woman I don't even know what could have happened because I was so scared, knew I technically wouldn't be able to go home but also I didn't have anywhere else to go.

So please if you have any judgements keep it to yourself thank you :)\n\nI got a random DM from someone but I assumed it was a spam account, so I ignored it. Curiosity got the best of me and a few minutes later I opened the message. It was pictures but the pics were blurred unless I accepted the message so I did. Then I see my cat!! I wish you all knew what I felt when I saw how big she'd gotten and how chunky lol. The lady I texted first never responded but she did see my message obvi bc the new DM I got was from Jane, who mentioned that I reached out to their friend.\n\nJane updated me on her (the cat) and explained the whole thing, told me she didn't know the cat belonged to me. Jane told me about how sweet she was, and I knew even after seeing her pictures that it was her. She told me she didn't want to give her (the cat) up since she's been with her for over a year and I thought I'd have a problem with that but after thinking about it, I wasn't mad about it. She's healthy, cared for, loved, fed, has a best friend who had it rough and they're close now. I wouldn't feel right taking her out her new home when she's happy and comfortable.\n\nOn top of that I have a female cat home with me, and I don't know if I would be able to afford to care for another cat. Jane sends me updates on my little gal and sometimes I ask for updates myself. And since some people in the last post mentioned that there's a possibility it wasn't my cat (even tho I 1000% knew), when I asked Jane what she calls the cat now, Jane responded with the name of the street I live on :D so yeah, it's my little gal. I'll always call her mine bc she was my first cat, and I can't see myself not calling her mine. Thanks for reading haha\n\nTLDR- I found the person who has my cat and decided to let them keep it.

Before, I was living in another town and commuting everyday which was taking a huge toll on me.\n\nFinally last week I reached an agreement with this lady. I had seen the apartment back in Christmas, but I wasn't interested back then due to the price. We finally got in touch again and she offered me a better price, which I agreed to. We set some conditions on text, and she told me the apartment would be ready \"next Friday\". She also said she wants rent paid in cash.\n\nI work nights so I asked if I could go there Friday morning right after work, but she works Friday morning then so she said maybe leave till Saturday. OK.\n\nOn Friday evening I texted her confirming I would go the next morning, to which she replies that she was hoping to meet afternoon\/evening since she still needs to clean, paint, move furniture etc.\n\nThis was shocking because not only did she not warn me, the flat was supposed to be ready the day before? but OK, I say let's meet Sunday instead because I cannot meet that late in the day. I work nights and so I need to sleep during the day.\n\nSunday morning I'm on my way to meet her and I receive a text - the door is open and keys inside the door, we can meet in the afternoon and I'll take your deposit and rent. This is strange but at least I have the keys now. I just want to pay her rent and get it over with because I don't like carrying a lot of cash around.\n\nIn the afternoon she still didn't show up - I ask for a specific time and she said they just went for food and we can meet later or tomorrow. I say fine, I'll just go back to my old apartment tonight and bring more of my things and meet tomorrow at lunchtime.\n\nSo here we are today, it's already late in the afternoon on Monday, been here since 1pm when I texted here saying I'm here. She hasn't replied, I hear her next door sometimes (oh yeah, my apartment is attached to her house btw). \n\nI don't know what to do, how am I gonna pay cash in rent every month to someone so flaky?

I honestly say that I wanted to find someone because I'm the type of person that I want to share my life with someone else, not because I need someone or can't be alone, but because I'd see it as an opportunity to give someone a share of my wonderful life. But anyways, after more negatives than positives and obviously loving being single than anything, I've learned about myself that I love my peace and love my current lifestyle, my schedule, what I do and don't do. I can't see myself allowing anyone telling me what to do, or how to do it, wasting energy on what could be toxic or a two face person, I just can't. I have planned out so much for my near and far future that I think I'm on a level that not just anyone can come in and be on it. When you find peace while being alone, you're values and self love are so valuable to you that you have no room for haggle towards anyone.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677969554.0},{"title":"I like saying weird things to my kid.","author":"Suspicious_Music_494","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CasualConversation\/comments\/11i81ck\/i_like_saying_weird_things_to_my_kid\/","text":"It's fun and it can be a learning experience. He just yelled at me from across our home that he wanted me to hang out in the same room as him. I yelled back that I couldn't, I was trapped between dimensions. He ran up behind me and gave me a bear hug, saying it would create a portal.\n\nI have at times told him I created him through parthenogenesis and that we needed to build a time machine. Kid is quick with the google. Sometimes his friends get in on it- last summer he said he wanted to build a ouiji board with his friend, I said I wasn't comfortable with that, but they could do a Luigi board. And they made one to contact Mario lol. \n\nI don't  know when we started being so silly, but it's nice.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677951983.0}]
