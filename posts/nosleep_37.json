Strangely I found the cab easily even when it was the peak of rush hour. I told the driver my address and he immediately took off.\n\nI pulled out my lighter and a cigarette when the driver spoke, \"Can You Light Mine Too?\". I was surprised as I haven't seen many cabbies smoke especially when they have a ride with them. I nodded as he was looking at me through the rearview mirror.\n\n\"It's tipping down huh.\", the cabbie said.\n\nI nodded. I wasn't particularly in the mood to speak and wanted to enjoy my cigarette quietly.\n\n\"Sorry, I was just trying to initiate a conversation. It's been a busy day for me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it had been for me too.\", I replied almost feeling pity for the cabbie.\n\n\"How's Samuel these days?\", he asked.\n\nI was frozen for a second there. He asked again, \"How's Samuel these days?\"\n\nI was now in utter shock, Samuel was my father's name. He never came to London, in fact, he was settled in Miami with my stepmother. My mother passed away when I was 5.\n\n\"Ho-How do you know him?\"\n\n\"Samuel?\", the cabbie asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I would've told you but my cigarette went out...can you light my cigarette?\", he asked.\n\nI looked at my hand, I just took a single puff during the whole ride while he completed a full cigarette, I tried to reason it in my mind by assuming he must've been a heavy smoker and must be quite experienced. I tried not to dwell on the thought much. I asked again lighting his cigarette, \"How do you know Samuel, my father?\"\n\n\"You are playing with fire Landon, you are sure to burn.\", he said sighing.\n\n\"Would you just answer?\"\n\n\"Ask him will you, tell him how did he survive the fire.\"\n\nI was getting desperate to hear the answer from his mouth. I slammed the back of his seat.\n\n\"Answer me DAMMIT!\", I shouted.\n\n\"Listen carefully, there lived a boy named Billy. Samuel and Billy were smokers too. They used to smoke a lot, then even skipped school for it. Then one day, they went to ride bikes and stopped at Bill's house. They lit a cigarette again as they wanted to finish one before heading in but they didn't know that Billy's father was fixing his car and had a gasoline can beside him. Samuel threw his cigarette and it went straight in. The burst was so hard that the house was on fire.\n\nSamuel somehow was alive and escaped from there while Billy shouted his name for help. Billy was still alive. Samuel ran away and an hour later the fire truck came along with the police and the medics. Everybody was dead till then except Billy's mother who was out shopping. Billy's younger sister and her dad along with Billy were badly burned. It was even hard to tag who was whom.\n\nThe incident was investigated and Samuel blamed Billy for smoking, when Billy's mother arrived at the scene she was in utter shock and fainted. Since then there was no one for her left she spent her whole life alone, blaming his son for the terror that fell upon them that day.\n\nSamuel could've told the truth, that might've helped the widowed lady and given her peace so that she could've forgiven his son. But Samuel never visited her and continued his life with just a scar of that incident.\"\n\nFather always showed me that scar telling me he got it while cooking food for my grandmother. I never believed him of course but I never knew the truth.\n\n\"How do you know all this?\", I asked.\n\n\"I would tell you but I am out of cigarettes and we arrived at the destination.\"\n\nI looked at my hand, my cigarette burnt out. I got off the cab making a mental note about asking my dad about it. The rain stopped and pulled out a small diary to note the cab's number. The cabbie went away before I could knock on his window and ask how he knows all about it.\n\nThe cab rushed away and I was alone on the street under the clouds. I pulled out a new cigarette and when I was about to light it I heard a whisper in my right ear, *Can you light my cigarette?* I looked back but there was no one, I was still alone.\n\nI went into the house and tried to light it again but whenever I did, I always heard the whisper, *Can you light my cigarette?*\n\nI was now getting frustrated and couldn't sleep so I decided to call my father.

I cursed at him for not telling her the truth and hung up the phone.\n\nThe next morning I took a cab to her house and told her the complete truth, she was weeping in front of me. I calmed her down and promised to visit her every weekend, somehow she smiled when I said that...\n\nAfter that day I quit smoking cause whenever I picked one out of my pocket I hear the whisper, *Can you light my cigarette?*",

        "text": "Second night of being home alone. Of course gaming as usual. As I'm talking to my friend I realise it's already 1 AM and as always we decide to talk about creepy stuff. This time though, for some reason I got really on edge. This was one of the reasons I left all lights inside the house on.\n\nTo help you get a better understanding of the situation I need to explain the layout of the room I was in. It was a big room with two entrances. One of the entrances led to a corridor and the other one to a bedroom. The entrance to the bedroom was on the opposite wall of where the windows were and the one to the corridor on the wall next to the bedroom entrance.\n\nWe finished the game we were playing and decided it's time to go to sleep so I left the call. I got ready for bed and finally went to turn the room's light off. The key for the lights was right next to the door leading to the corridor. Just as I was about to turn it off I was facing the windows which had long vertical blinds. The moment the room got enveloped in darkness I noticed something on the blinds. As I was waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness the silhouette I was looking at became clearer and clearer and then... fear struck me. For a second I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. It was a man. A man's shadow. In a split second I turned the lights on. I didn't even know what to think at this moment. The only thought that came was to turn them off again and see if I didn't just imagine something since I was on edge from earlier. And so I did and once again... the same shadow on the blinds. This time right after I turned the lights back on I got the courage to go and check behind the blinds. And after quickly moving them I realised... there was nothing. \n\nI tried to calm down as I told myself that it was probably just a strange shadow cast from a tree, but I couldn't believe this. The shadow was so on point. It was literally like someone was standing outside my window. I somehow got the courage to go to sleep while this was still there just standing, almost like it's watching me.\n \nNext day came. I did the usual stuff I do. Even though I felt fine during the day I just couldn't get what happened out of my head. I knew I was going to be home alone again. And I just kept thinking... what if I see this thing again. Would I be able to keep my composure this time?\nI decided that this night I would go to bed earlier. I filled myself with courage. I got convinced that it was just my fear playing tricks on me. \n\nI went and started to turn off every light this time. Finally I got to the room I saw the shadow in turned off the light and... nothing. I felt a great relief and as I went to turn off the last light which was in the bedroom I turned around and to my surprise the shadow... it was there again. This time it was different though. The moment I moved I realised the shadow moved with me. A cold chill ran all over me as I realised. The shadow from last night didn't come from outside... SOMEONE WAS INSIDE MY HOUSE.\n\nI slowly turned around again and immediately I noticed something strange under the bed in the bedroom. I almost choked. I tried to act normally even though I failed miserably. I left the room and went for the exit. The plan was to lock whoever was in the house inside it. And just as I was reaching the exit I heard a loud THUMP. I immediately blasted off and as I got out my key and started locking... BANG, the door got bashed from inside but I managed to hold and lock it right after. I immediately called 911 but the guy had escaped through a window.\n\nFrom then on I always keep the door locked. I just know that no matter how low the chance is for something bad to happen, it exists and just as you think that it won't happen to you, misfortune enters.",

        "text": "Hi Reddit! My husband David and I managed to snag up a little place out in the Aussie bush right before the prices went wild.\n\n\nIt's a really cool property with tonnes of bushland and a few fields for farming. There are some old structures and things on the property but we haven't had too close a look yet as they're all burned up. The main house was in quite the state when we got it too. We got pretty lucky in an estate sale and \"work from home\" hadn't quite become permanent at this stage in the housing game which is how we scored so well.\n\n\nWe had to wait for the tradies to be done with the debris clean, repairs, and renovations (let me tell you, they weren't joking about the timber shortage. Bloody hell!), and then the second cleaners and pest guys. It was worth the wait though.\n\n\nWe've just started moving in all of our stuff (Dale has a LOT of stuff!) and now while my husband is at work, I've got the lovely duty of finding places for all our things (except our wedding photos. The walls look SO good with their fresh coat of paint that I'm hesitant about driving in a nail!) \n\n\nSorry, I ramble. The point is: I've finally had the chance to rummage through the cupboards and see if we got any cool things left behind from the other owners. With two sets of cleaners coming through, I wasn't expecting anything. The kitchen has a cute little breadbox though, and I guess it didn't need to be touched up too badly. I was giving the kitchen an antibacterial wipedown before putting plates and things away (with so many contractors in and about I wanted to be safe!) and taped on the roof of the breadbox I found the weirdest note.\n\n\nIt might just be a prank but I know that you guys love weird stuff, so I've transcribed what I can from the note below: \n\n\nMum. I know we havent spoken since the wedding but please I need your help. I cant go to Kara anymore. Dad is doing better and I don't want to put him on a backtrack.\n\n\nI know you're still mad that I included dad in my speech when I thanked youse both for giving me and Lara the house. It was still his house to (sic). I know what he put us through. I know he was the reason you sent me to live with Nan. I still wanna love my dad.\n\n\nThat doesnt mean that me and Clarissa dont think you havent been good to us. She always says since we been together that you were a fucken tuff cookie (sic). I just wanted to leave you some notes for when you sell this place after i go. Sorry if i dont see your face again.\n\n\nSince youse, mostly you, always visited me at Nans place I dont know whats normal in the house. I thought Id give a list of shit to be fixed:\n\n- Tap always turns on by itself \n\n- Sometimes the kitchen roof leaks sap or something \n\n- The porch light turns off if it gets windy -- I think it's the wind because it's when the bushes and trees are shaking mad crazy\n\n- Check the barn for squatters the light keeps turning on at night but it's off when we check in the morning. We keep a lock on it but maybe theres a loose panel\n\nWhen Christine and me moved in it was all good at first. Everything worked like a dream coz I know you fixed it up before you got the caravan. \n\n\nI know you said dad went crazy. BUT It seemed to went (sic) really fast downhill after he took them teeth from when we were up in there in the kitchen roof and found them. I though about that day. He went for a walk and went right into the roof.\n\n\n\nDo you remember? You started ringing doctors around that time. He told me someone he saw in the bush said to check the roof. So if he was just sick he wouldnt of (sic) found anything? He found those teeth wrapped in the cloth. Remember? Little animal teeth and you said to chuck them out and they were nothing. Someone would of (sic) wrapped them though? \n\n\nA window got broken right after that and you blamed me saying I was a problem. I know you were scared dad was forgetting you and all of that but now I have to tell you it really wasnt me. The hole in the wall when you were with dad at the doctors wasnt me. It couldnt have been dad. He was with you. I think I get it. I know WE didnt see anyone in the bush but guess what? Klara went for a bushwalk a few months back.\n\n\nI only put it together recently but a few days after that she told me to check in the roof. I think she saw whoever dad did. She didnt seem scared. After that is when all the shit started breaking. I know Angela didn't do it. I probably sound like him and that could give you the creepies (sic) like you (unintelligible - \"always said he\" maybe?) did. \n\n\nWE FOUND BONES!!!!!!! SMALL BONES!!!! IN WHITE CLOTH LIKE WHAT I REMEMBER THE TEETH!!!! I had them on the table then they werent there and not in the roof when I rechecked!!! \n\n\nWe cant stay here. Paris has not been home. She says she cant handle me when I'm like this. I dont know what that means. She said I gave her a bruise that I apparently choked her I DID NOT GIVE HER A BRUISE. I THINK I WOULD OF (sic) REMEMBERED CHOKING MY (can't figure this part out) WIFE!! I AM NOT ON DRUGS. I DO NOT DRINK. IM NOT A FUCKING WOMAN BASHER THATS FUCKED!!!!!! I LOVE MY WIFE AND I WANTED THAT IN WRITINT (sic) BECAUSE IM FUCKING PISSED OFF!!!  SO TONIGHT IM GOING TO THE FUCKING SHED WHEN THE LIGHT COMES ON. IF THAT SQUATTING PRICK HAS HURT LAURA I WILL FUCKING CLOCK HIM SO SHE KNOWS I WOULD NEVER LAY A FUCKING FINGER ON HER! I. LOVE. ADELYNNE. FOR. FUCKING. EVER.\n\n\nSo thats why I write because it's that fuckhead or me. Whoever is in there keeps flicking the lights on and off like they wanna fucking go so lets go\n\n\nMum I love you. I love Daisy. When she comes back from where ever (sic) she went tell her that if I don't come back let her remarry. I love you and it takes a lot for you to not get a devorce (sic) when dad went like that but I just want her to be happy. I have enough money from the mines to set her up real nice. \n\n\nIt ends.\n\nLove Grayson.\n\n[End of letter] \n\nSo there you go, Reddit. Pre-emptively: The realestate laws in my state (Queensland) are a bit iffy when it comes to what has to be disclosed. \"Material facts\" must be disclosed if they'd make the buyer change their mind, and we've had cases where someone later found out their house was a murder house and got their deposit back/out of their contract. However, since we got this in an estate sale, I don't think we'd really have a case for not knowing the nitty gritty of what happened.\n\n\nAdditionally, the buildings that I can see from the house are all burned out (could have been vandalism from when the property was on the market. It was like that when we inspected it. Just didn't bother to renovate yet since we don't need it). \n\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post. Daniel will be back from his bushwalk soon so I better get back to it before he gets his hands on the home decor and I get a lecture on my collection of throw pillows. \n\n\nDylan's been out here since the sale. Sometimes he went for a gander at the rest of the property (\"exploring the wilderness\" he'd call it, even though his Runescape days are long behind him!) Other times he'd help the tradies (when they let him, lol!). Unfortunately, after they replaced some roof stuff above the kitchen he managed to get hurt pretty badly and we promised not to sue (since it was his fault!) but they wouldn't let him help anymore. He still kept going out to the property though. Probably just to \"explore the wilderness\".\n\n\nOff topic but since this subreddit gets way more traffic than some of the others, I thought I'd just ask here in case there are any doctors lurking: Shay's accident with the roof got his arms a bit sore/scratched and banged up his knee. I'm trying to get him to see a doctor because he's got this bruise that sort of wraps around his neck but he isn't worried because he didn't hit his head, neck, or chest. I'm alarmed, but if someone can let me know if I should try harder to get Vince alarmed (and to a doctor!!) I'd be forever grateful.\n\n\nWe really love it out here. The air is fresh. The mornings are new... And I am so excited for what comes next.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nWhen I was **13** (I'm **15** now), I had some weird occurrences with my cupboard. I'll describe it for you, It was from Ikea, mainly birch wood with white paint, some parts like the shelves were left birch, two main sliding doors (White), left has shelves, right one is for hanging clothes, and lemme tell you, it was quite huge. this was in my Biggest brother's room, who had just departed for Hungary (University), and my middle brother's room was getting quite congested. Naturally my Middle brother's complaints began of how I should move into the other room, which my mother said \"Why not\". Now I was in the room, and Sadly My bed could not fit in this room, and my Bigger brother's bed had already been sold before I moved in to his room. Now ill describe the room, I slept on a mattress, and it was on the edge of the room, and directly opposing my feet, was the cupboard.\n\n**First night:** *8pm*: Getting ready for sleep, packed my bag for school, hung my clothes in the   \nwashroom, everything is set, say goodnight to my cat as he sleeps right next to my   \nhand (I sleep like a burrito, yeah... weird).  \n*9pm*: sleeping, nothing strange  \n*2am*: I wake up to the sound of whining, its the wheels of the sliding doors of the   \ncupboard, the door is swaying from it's closed position, to semi open, very VERY   \nlowly, then it stops, and slowly retreats back to it's closed position, it continued for   \n10 minutes or so, it was quite peculiar, every time it opened, A chilly breeze was let   \nout, during this time frame, my cat was nowhere to be seen, he had left the room   \npresumably. after 20 minutes I had gone back to sleep, when I woke up for school again, there he was, but this time he was at my feet, kind of confusing.  \nThis continued for a week or so, and me being a 13 year old, told my parents about it, of course they didn't believe me, that a newly bought cupboard, had problems with sliding, but just out of curiosity, My dad used the thing where like you can see if things are level or not, and weirdly it was level, straight, no angles nothing whatsoever.  \nAfter a month of me complaining, my dad decided to add a Security camera from that Ring company, Its still here. What my dad saw even surprised him, on the camera, at every night when it was 2 to 3 am, The doors slid open, again very slowly, and when they were at half open, the camera started flickering, the screen was fully static, 10 minutes later, perfectly operational, like it never occured.  \nTwo months go by and this very occurrence happens every night, 2-3am for 10 minutes, but one night, it was late, at 3:30am, I automatically woke up at 2, as, now my body was used to the whining of the wheels, but i was resting there, awake, for quite long, nothing happened. as soon as it became 3:30am, I was in trance-like situation, I was stuck there, couldn't move anything, just my eyes, almost similar to paralysis, Even I thought that at that moment, then the doors slid open, this time, faster than usual, much faster, and there was a groan instead of a whine from the wheels, there were translucent fingers, huge fingers pushing the door aside from inside, and there it was. I don't know how to properly explain it, a translucent hovering figure, right above my feet, no legs, slightly electric blue at his edges, it stood there, almost like it was waiting, and those eyes, I will never forget them, They were blank, emotionless, life less, but yet the glowed, Glowed neon blue, at a concentrated point, he was staring into my soul, I couldn't move, but then I slowly regained control of most of my head, I opened my jaw, wide. Nothing, Nothing came out, just a slight short screech, then that thing, he , closed his eyes, for a second I thought I was safe, but then it opened them wider, its pupils dialated, and that neon blue was a raidant Yellow, it charged for me , It's hand strecthed out, grabbed my neck, and choked me with brute strength, then it suddenly stopped, as it slowly retreated back into the closet and closing the sliding door behind, moments later my cat had came back to my side, I pieced it all together, It made slight send that the cat was the only thing preventing him from coming out of that closet/cupboard. Once I was able to perfectly move my body, I signaled my cat to go eat food, I was right beside him going to the washroom too, his food is kept there, and yes the cat understands signals. I washed my face and looked down onto my neck, with great horror, there it was, My whole neck was bright red, and it started hurting too, as I glanced back at my self staring on my eyes in the mirror, for a while he appeared again within my reflection, His eyes were once again neon blue, he tilted his head and slowly uttered \"I'll see you again, very soon\" with a groaning voice, and his hand had almost reached my shoulder, until My dad walked in on me asking what I was doing in the washroom at 3am, I told him the story and he checked the camera and once again it went static, but for much longer, and my neck was still blistering red. From that day onward I had always kept my cat with me.  \n\n\nMy cat isn't here with me at this very moment, and now my new closet has it's door opening, I'm scared, My battery is dyeing, I can hear him saying slowly but constantly \"I told you so\". He's back, White eyes is back.",

        "text": " So, this all started on May 2003 - I do not remember the specific date. \n\n There used to be a man - dressed in a clown costume - who came up to my door every Monday and knocked on it. He did nothing more, nothing less. Just knocked on my door. The man had a clown mask which had fake blood splattered on it and a clown costume with red buttons - 4 exactly - one of them missing. He wore no shoes or socks, and his feet were constantly bloody from the rocks. It creeped me out. So much.\n\n I remember this vividly - I was 7. It must've been my brother's birthday. In our family tradition, we always stay until midnight when it's someone's birthday, so they can enjoy the entirety of it.  It just so happened that it was also the first night that the Clown knocked. It was 23:59, and we were about to sing the song - when he did it. \n\n Father and I went to get it, and my brother - who I'll call Marvin - looked out of the window.\n\n \"Da-ad? It- It's a clown! You know I don't like clow-owns!\" wailed Marvin.\n\n \"I never invited a clown. Is it here to, er... celebrate with us? Ma?\" \n\n \"I do not know,\" said mother. Our family was quite posh - and rich at that. All of us - at least I thought all of us - thought that he wanted to entertain us for money. Our house was quite big, so maybe the man realised we were rich. But after about 5 minutes he walked away.\n\n This carried on for 2 years, all week, every Monday. Nothing changed. We got used to it for a while so we stopped checking. \n\n Jacob Baker went missing. Our city was quite small so word got around quickly - all the way to us. The day was a Sunday - I remember that - and we were scared - Jacob lived on the other side of the road. Maybe I would go missing too? I pondered, but deep down I knew I wouldn't get kidnapped. Hopefully.\n\n Monday night. No knocks. \n\n \"What a weird coincidence!\" said Mother. \"I mean, Jacob went missing... and no knocks... right?\"\n\n One and a half months go by. No knocks. It wasn't a coincidence, Jacob Baker was the clown. We forgot it after a while, and one night I went to sleep. July 2003. I was asleep in my Ma and Pa's room, because I had a nightmare.\n\n*Knock, knock, knock.*\n\nMy heart leapt. I thought Jacob was gone.\n\n*KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.*\n\nLouder this time. Mother and father both woke up. \n\n\"I thought he was--?\" said father. They both walked down the stairs with each a baseball bat. Marvin was sleeping soundly, he was 4 at the time. I stared at him, wondering if they were going to kidnap him (I was 7). \n\n\"Honey! Jacob Baker is back! Call 911!\" I heard mom's voice.\n\n*KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!*\n\n*\"That* isn't Jacob. It isn't. I know it isn't, trust me. Look at his fingers... they have no fingernails. They're clawed.\" said Father. I got up and looked down the stairs. He was looking at the camera through the door. \"I know it isn't. It's... it's the same costume, though... you don't think?.. Matilda... get the children and throw them through the kitchen window. Hand me the shotgun.\" \n\nI could hear mother scramble around and then I saw her, handing father a shotgun; her silver hair looked messy and tired. I crawled up and went back to ma and pa's bed. I heard her coming upstairs and I acted to sleep. I felt mother grab me by my armpits and I knew that she also grabbed Marvin. At this point is when he woke up.\n\n\"Mama? Where are we going?\" \n\n\"I...\" mother walked to the kitchen and I opened my eyes. She went out of the window, along with us. The gates opened as my mother kicked them over. She wasn't strong, the gates were just weak. She walked all the way to the driveway when she saw the Clown walk away. It didn't notice us. Mother came back in.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"They just walked away... The monster...\" \n\nIt didn't come back until 6 months later. Dad kept a shotgun next to his bed after the incident. This time, we were all asleep in our separate rooms.\n\n***Knock.*** \n\nNot again...\n\n***Knock.***\n\nI heard father wake up.\n\n***Knock.***\n\nFather loaded the shotgun. This time I went downstairs with him. He didn't say a word. \n\n\"HONEY. GRAB THE CHILDREN AND GET TO THE STREETS. GO TO THE APPARTMENT COMPLEX.\" My memory faded after that. All I knew is that was the last time I saw my father. But not the last time I saw the clown. Every 6 months, he still comes around. About 4 years ago my mother died. Nobody is there to protect me. Marvin moved out. My wife broke up with me after she found out about the clown...\n\n***Knock.***\n\n***Knock.***\n\n***Knock.***\n\nI heard it just now. I forgot to buy bullets after the last incident. I know I might die right now if he gets me. I live on the 13th floor of the complex, so I'd be lucky if I manage to escape alive. If the clown comes around to your house, just remember these things:\n\n**1) Go downstairs before the 9th knock and wait it out in your backyard.**\n\n**1a) If you live in an apartment like I do, hide in a place where the clown hadn't checked last time. I am out of hiding places.**\n\n**2) Shotguns are useless. They'll just skim off of the clown's body. That's how father died.**\n\n**3) If the clown finds you, do not move. There is a chance the clown won't see you.**\n\nGood luck out there.",

        "text": "I think I'm losing my mind. Everyone I've talked to thinks I'm having some kind of memory loss, but I really don't think that's the case. I would give everything for it to only be a memory loss. Let me start with some facts. I’m 22 years old. I don’t abuse alcohol or any other substances. I don’t have any mental health problems, and my life has always been nice and peaceful.\n\nIt all started three weeks ago. I was in need of new glasses, since the last time I bought a new pair was four years ago. I’m blind like a bat without them, so the price isn’t going to be low. \n\nI was searching the internet, when an ad pops up. It seemed very much like the spam ads you get from sketchy websites, so my natural instingt was to click the x. Before I managed to do that, another ad appears on my screen. The same ad. I decided to at least read it before clicking it away, figuring that there’s no harm in doing that. It was an ad for an optician’s. The ad promised affordable quality lenses and frames. It also read, that the shop had just opened, in the city I lived in! Seemed too good to be true, but I had no extra money. That led me to write the addres of the shop down.\n\nI lost my way two times trying to find the shop. It was well hidden, next to a small pantry I remember having seen sometimes going past it. The optician’s seemed empty from where I parked my car, but the lights were on. And I was right, no one else was inside. I walked up to the counter and rang the bell.\n\n Before the sound from the bell had quieted down, a very well-dressed middle-aged man walked up to me from the back. “Well hello, how may I help you today”. The man seemed tired, but excited. As if he had been waiting for a customer for a long time. “I was looking to buy new glasses. These old ones have marks all over the lenses, and I think it’s time to change the frames also” I told him. He didn’t answer for a while. Just kept looking at me, observing, maybe hesitating about something. And then he seemed to make it, because next he said. “You came to the right place. This is after all an optician’s. Here, choose your frames and we’ll get to work.” He showed me to the shelves full of frames, in all colors and shapes. Way more than what you normally see. I took my sweet time trying on different styles, and finally decided. I chose to go with a similar style as I had before, though, a different color.\n\nI gave the man my prescription and my frame choice. He mumbled something, but I couldn’t hear what he said. “What?” I then asked. “Here. For your address”. The man gave me an annoyingly small post-it note, but I managed to squeeze my address on it. And that was it. I paid the surprisingly low price and went to make my way out. “Happy to help you see!” He waved me goodbye and I drove home.\n\nMy new glasses were on my doorstep the next morning I woke up. I woke up when someone knocked at my door. I was feeling extremely tired so I took some time to get up. By the time I got to the door, the person who had knocked was gone. My newly made glasses were laying in front of me. No package, no case or anything. I found it very weird, but I wasn’t gonna complain since I paid so little for them. And the delivery was extremely fast. So fast, I almost was going to call the optician to ask why it took so little time to make new lenses. The thought of doing that stopped when I remembered that I didn’t have the shop’s phone number written anywhere. Yes, I could have driven there and ask in person, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. I should’ve have. \n\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, my face seems to be changing in the mirror more and more every day. Not just the mirrors, though. Every reflecting surface, windows and small puddles on the sidewalk. When first noticed the changes, they were very small and barely noticeable, at least to someone that's not me. I have called my mom about this, but of course she didn't believe me. Even I don’t know what to think about this. \n\nFirst, my eyebrows seemed to have slightly changed shape. I thought that maybe I had accidentally shaved my brows more than intended last time, so I just shook the weird feeling off. The second change was much bigger compared to the first. I was in the school bathroom, and when I lifted my head to see myself in the mirror, my nose was crooked. I panicked. It seemed broken, but how could I have broken my nose without noticing? If it was a memory loss and I was just slowly forgetting my face, surely I'd have some medical bills or papers from the doctor if I had gone to have my nose looked at, but I found nothing. I called my mom to ask if I had talked to her something about breaking my nose recently, but she didn't recall that ever happening. She suggested, that  maybe I had broke it when I was asleep, falling from the bed and somehow broke it without waking up. I marked my calendar after the call to go see a doctor if my nose started to hurt.\n\nSecond week was even worse. I have been complimented on my healthy and thick blonde hair all my life, but now, it was ashy gray and seemed half dead. My eyes as well, the sparkle was gone. I see no life in the eyes that stare back at me. They are dark eyes, but they have a kind of milky veil over them, like you would see in a blind person's eyes. Normally my head is in the shape of an almond, but now it has a rounder feel to it, if I look in the mirror long enough. And the mouth, the mouth is the worst. Usually, when you think of a smile in your head, you see a warm and welcoming face. This is the furthest thing from that. It’s more like a grin, a deep, deranged grin. It is so wide I can see every teeth in her mouth. In my mouth. I have no idea. I'm having a hard time trying to find familiar facial traits anymore, and trust me, I have tried. \n\nNow it's the third week. My expression in the mirror seems judgemental, the face stares at me with a contemptuous look. I can't stand to look in the mirror, windows or sidewalk puddles. I covered every mirror in my house with clothes. My windows have newspapers all over them. I'm terrified of my face. Or more like what's left of it. I feel so lost. I know what I look like, I have my phone’s gallery full of selfies and pictures with my friends, where I still see my old self. But now, whenever I try to look at myself, all I can see is this old woman with the crooked nose. I haven’t taken off my new glasses, except when I sleep. Thought of that helping my situation never crossed my mind, since I can’t do anything without them. But now, I’m so scared I would much rather be blind than see this.",

        "text": "My name is Zavier Douglas, and I was born into this world as an experiment. Strange, I know. I wasn’t the only one, either. I’m a twin to a brother, Benjamin. Ben is the youngest, born 3 minutes past me, technically. While being a twin is unique, that is not what has made us special. Our parents, Trinity and Westen Douglas were genetic scientists. Their life’s work was in research and experimentation in genetic mutation and DNA bonding. In short, they studied and experimented with naturally occurring gene mutations in familial bonds. More specifically, twins. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYears of research led to discovery of a gene mutation that only happens in identical twins. This mutation was dubbed the Bonded Extrasensory Gene, or (BE) Gene. (BE) Gene is responsible for the extreme connection identical twins experience. This isn’t just any twin bond. This is much different. Most twins can sense each other’s feelings and thoughts. This is beyond that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen and I are bonded in how we were born, but also because of the Gene and DNA experiments wrought by our parents. Their results yielded biological children, as twins, where one experiences phenomena and the other experiences the effect—lovingly nicknamed “Cause” and “Effect.” Ben is Cause, and I am Effect. Records from the delivery show I was born healthy and without issues via cesarean delivery. Ben, on the other hand, was born in crisis. Upon pulling him from the womb, the doctors found the cord wrapped around his neck and body. The pull to free him had tightened the cord and begun to strangle him. Although I had been fine 3 minutes prior, I declined rapidly. My breathing had stopped, my face turned purple, and my heart rate plummeted. Somehow, Ben was fine. He didn’t cry, gasp, wheeze, or make a face. He was born wholly silent and alert, although being strangled to death. Nurses frantically attempted to stabilize me while the doctors worked to free Ben. After a few moments, Ben was free. Seconds later, I gasped loudly and became stable. Life-saving attempts were no longer required, and the phenomena were documented for further research on behalf of my parents. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur life was interesting, to say the least. We did what was expected of kids; play time, snacks, naps, school, etc. In between those normal activities, we were a part of an ongoing experiment. Every Monday, our parents would take our vitals, draw blood, and perform a test. Every test was different in some way. Ben and I would sit at opposite tables, and each of our parents would stand by one of us. The test was done, and the results were documented. Early on, I learned to hate Mondays. That may have been one of the few normal feelings I shared with society. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe incident at birth was isolated until we were about six years old. Until then, the tests Ben and I would go through were easy. Eat this, drink this, or tell me about this. Sometimes there were intelligence tests where there were multiple-choice questions. Other times there were physical tests, where we would run a treadmill or do strenuous exercise for a long time. One morning, during the usual blood draw, our parents were surprised. As our father inserted the needle into Ben’s arm, I cried out and clamped at my arm. Our mother grabbed my arm to inspect the trouble. I had a bleeding needle mark on the same arm as Ben’s. It couldn’t have been mistaken for anything else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Westen, it’s happening.”, our mother said with excitement. She looked at our father, who had stopped his work with Ben. He had put down the needle and tube and picked up a band-aid. “This is wonderful. I knew that if we just gave it a little more time, we would see the real results.”, he said while applying the band-aid to Ben. Following suit, my mother placed a band-aid on my arm and then walked away. They had moved to the counter at the side of the room and spoke in low voices. I looked over at my brother, who was innocently kicking his feet over the side of the table. I wasn’t sure what had happened or why our parents were so excited at the time. I was terrified, sitting there on the cold steel table. Ben was unphased as if nothing had happened. After a few moments, I heard our parents conclude their conversation. “We have to run more tests. We need to have more data before moving into the following research phase.”, our mother said. “Whatever it takes.”, they both agreed. Mondays were never the same after that, and life changed drastically.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlood draws were done differently. Instead of simultaneous tests, mine would be first, then Ben’s, then I would have mine done again. This was because my brother’s blood test would forever become mine. The other tests were…more aggressive. Harmless tests became painful and terrifying. One test left me with a permanent scar on my left thigh. Our mother used local anesthesia to numb Ben’s upper thigh. From the other side of the room, I stared at my father, who was preparing for what was coming. He had recently installed restraints on the tables. I hadn’t noticed until he was strapping me down. I lurched against the straps unsuccessfully. “Calm down; it’ll be over quickly. It won’t hurt as bad as you think.”, my father said with a stone face. He was loving and kind when he wasn’t working. We spent time together outside of the tests. He doted on us often, surprised us with gifts, and celebrated birthdays and holidays. Our mother, however, was hardly a parent. To me, at least. She enjoyed time with Ben, but not often. She was absorbed in work mostly. She carried a stiff attitude toward me and was never affectionate. She started working with my brother on the tests instead of me at some point. I had overheard her telling my father that she couldn’t handle my crying and complaining anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA timer went off, and our mother picked up a scalpel from the tray nearest her. My head snapped to the side to see Ben playing his handheld game. Not a bit of concern or hesitation on his face. Stone cold. Her hands moved to his thigh and began an incision. Slow, steady movements revealed pink and red layers inside and blood leaked from the fresh wound. At the same time, I wailed as a bleeding incision appeared on my own. I thrashed hard against my restraints and screamed. I begged my father to let me go, but he didn’t budge. He scribbled some notes on a pad of paper while inspecting my leg, ignoring my pleas. I looked back at my mother, hoping she would feel something from my cries. She cleaned the wound she left on Ben, preparing to close it. She purposefully avoided my gaze. Ben continued to play his game, and father worked on closing my wound. He was kind enough to use anesthesia before stitching, at least.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTests like this happened more and more frequently. I had come to know our mother as cruel and heartless. I knew I couldn’t count on our father, either. So, I tried to lean on Ben for support. I tried to express my suffering to him but was met with a stern look and silence. We had been close at one time. We did what twins do; played tricks, understood each other, knew each other’s thoughts and feelings, etc. After the tests became worse, he started becoming more like our mother. He would counter my complaints with a steely gaze and turn away. I couldn’t get through to him. Any other time, we were okay. As kids, even as twins, you argue and fight. As our parent’s tests continued, we disagreed more often and grew apart. Small fights turned severe, and actual harm started being threatened. Ben had come to understand the situation and weaponized it against me. If I didn’t agree to his terms on a game, he would grab something sharp and shove it toward his body. “I’ll do it. I know what will happen, and so do you. Play my way, and you won’t get hurt.”, he would tell me. I would always give in for fear of what would happen. Eventually, it became his way of tormenting me. He had become something worse than our mother. She was cruel and heartless, but he was a monster. Sometimes I did get hurt. I would get brave and refuse his demands, only to have him slice us open. He never cared if it did any harm to him, just that it would hurt me. This would all end when I turned fifteen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can’t explain how right now, but I got out. I escaped and found a way to hide for the past seventeen years. It wasn’t easy, and I was severely hurt when I got away. “Don’t follow me, and don’t attempt to hurt us.” This was the last message I texted to Ben before I left for good. The earlier events would probably make him think twice about ending us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing happened to me afterward. For seventeen years, I have lived peacefully with my wife, Raina. Along the way, we had a son, Carter. He will be eight here in a few days, and I’m filled with dread. I had been working on my car in the garage two days ago. Carter was playing in the driveway, and Raina was nearby in the yard. I was leaning in to look at the battery terminals for corrosion when I suddenly felt light-headed. When I fully stood up to close the hood, I stumbled and hit my head on the corner of the car. I cussed as I went down. “Fuck, that hurts,” I mumbled. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRaina must have heard the *thump* and my cursing. I felt her hand on my shoulder and her soft voice behind me. “You’re tired, I can tell. It would be best if you lay down for a while after you ice that spot.”, she said, rubbing my shoulder a bit. I complied and went in to take a nap. I felt worse by the time I got to the bedroom. I had stumbled a few more times, banged my foot against the leg of a table, and my head was swimming. I didn’t even bother to take off the clothes I had been working in. I remember thinking that Raina would be livid with me later. When I woke up, it had been nearly ten hours since I laid down. The house was still and quiet. My wife was asleep next to me, softly snoring. I slipped out of bed and headed to the bathroom. When I turned the light on, I met my face in the mirror. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked pale and worn. My eyes even looked dilated. I rubbed my face and winced. Something felt off with my arm. I raised my sleeve to find a slight cut above the bend of my elbow. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was still groggy and wanted to change into something clean before heading back to bed. I went to the closet, tiptoeing, so I didn’t wake Raina. I grabbed shorts and a clean t-shirt and headed back to the bathroom. As I took off my work clothes, I realized my back was sore. Turning my back to the mirror, I found a message. It was carved into the skin of my back that read, “Find me.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been two days, and I can’t stop thinking about my brother. I don’t know what he wants, and I don’t want to find out. The only trouble is that I just got another message. It appeared on my wrist earlier today. In tiny scratches, it says, “Help me.” I don’t think I can ignore this. Something feels different and off. I don’t know how to explain it, but I think I need to find Ben.",

        "text": "It was that time of year when *‘fresh corn’* signs along the rural roadside were a common sight. Not being a big connoisseur of either fresh produce or farmer’s markets, I had never pulled over for one myself. But it was one particularly attention-grabbing sign that caused me to finally decide to give roadside corn a try. It was a hand-painted, blood-red sign with white, almost calligraphic lettering advertising ‘*One-of-a-kind Crimson Corn! Sweet &amp; Savoury, $7 a Dozen – Cash Only! Try Our Diabolical Corn Maze And Win A Secret Prize!’*.\n\nIntriguingly, the sign had a labyrinth symbol encircled by an Ouroboros – a snake eating its own tail. I had never heard of Crimson Corn, and found myself curious enough to make a slight detour to see what it was. The sign pointed down a dusty driveway which led through a thick tree line that kept me from seeing if there was actually anything down on the other end. It would have made more business sense to put their corn stand on the side of the road, but I figured they must really want people to see this corn maze of theirs.\n\nAnd as it turned out, I was right.\n\nI turned left down the bumpy dirt path just barely wide enough to accommodate my car, passing under a wooden arch as I crossed the tree line. As I drove under it, I took note of an odd mechanical-looking box attached to the archway’s side. I wondered briefly what it was, but the thought immediately left my mind as I left the trees behind me and entered the farmstead.\n\nOn a hill in front of me sat a picturesque, dark red barn alongside a stately farmhouse that looked more like it should be the penthouse of a high-rise building, and all around them were cornfields of towering, crimson corn stalks. I had just naturally assumed that crimson corn had been referring to the kernels, but it was their foliage that was as red as a Japanese Maple’s. It was a bewitching sight, such vast fields of surreal-looking corn, swaying and rustling in the soft wind. Even the sunlight felt slightly off and dreamlike, but I chalked that up to the way it refracted off the red leaves. Though there was no sun to be seen, the sky was cloudy enough that I thought nothing of it.\n\nThe corn stand itself was set up at the very edge of the field, beneath the shade of a gnarled and twisted oak and beside the entrance to the maze. Many baskets of picked corn were laid out ready for purchase, and the stand was staffed by a girl who looked to be around twenty years old. She had brilliant blue eyes, pitch-black hair in bunches, and wore a red and white checkered farm dress.\n\nShe exhaled a long drag from her cigarette and gave me a friendly smile and a nod as I pulled up beside her. I noticed that she was barefoot with bright red nail polish that contrasted sharply with the dirty and calloused soles of her feet. I gave so much attention to her feet that I barely gave a thought to the three large, dark creatures lying around them.\n\n“Hello there, Ducky! Looking for some corn?” she beamed.\n\n“Hello yourself. I’ve never seen corn like this before. Is it really one of a kind?” I asked.\n\n“Absolutely – our own private cultivar of corn. One hundred percent Non-GMO! It’s pesticide-free too, so you can even eat it fresh off the stalk!\"\n\nThe girl set down her cigarette in an ashtray and picked up a cob of pre-shucked corn, producing a satisfying crunching sound as she bit into it. Red juices squirted outwards and ran down her chin as she looked up at me with a suggestive – if obviously mercantile – stare.\n\nI can't say it wasn't an effective sales tactic though, as I found myself stepping towards her and reaching for my wallet. I only stopped when an aggressive snort drew my attention back to the animals at her feet and was surprised to see that they were, in fact, large, black pigs.\n\n“Oh! I thought those were dogs,” I muttered dumbly.\n\n“I prefer pigs to dogs,” she explained, throwing down some unshucked corn for them to devour. “They’re just as smart, but they haven’t been bred for unconditional loyalty – so if a pig likes you, you know you earned it. Sorry if they startled you, but a girl can’t be sitting out here and meeting with random strangers without a bit of protection.”\n\nAs the pigs chomped down on their corn, it stained their teeth and mouths red, an effect which was much less enticing on them than it was on the girl. I had never been so close to pigs without a fence between us, and I couldn't help but take note that even the smallest one looked like it weighed more than I did. They were extremely formidable-looking creatures, and I didn't doubt that they could do some serious damage if I got on their bad side.\n\nThey grunted and snorted hostilely as they ate, all of them giving me an evil eye that seemed almost resentful – as if they’d rather be eating me than the corn.\n\n“Hey, hey, hey! That’s enough of that, fellas,” the girl scolded them gently as she knelt down and started scratching the largest one behind the ear. “Don’t mind them, Ducky. They’re harmless, really – so long as they’re fed on time.”\n\nThe pig rolled over on its back to let the girl rub its belly, all of its menacing aura instantly vanishing as it took on the trappings of a typical pet. The other two pigs laid back down in the shade and seemed to lose all interest in me, allowing me to immediately regain my confidence.\n\n“Yeah, they don’t look like they skip too many meals,” I bantered back. “Are they really all you got watching your back out here? Your Pa’s not going come running out with a shotgun if he hears a commotion or something like that?”\n\n“My Pa? No. My brother’s around here somewhere though; in the maze, I think,” she said with an uncertain glance towards the maze entrance. “He doesn’t have any of his guns on him, but if you’re thinking of causing trouble, I don’t much care for your chances.”\n\n“I’m not planning any trouble, Miss. Just concerned for your safety, is all” I assured her. “So do you recommend eating this corn raw, or is it good cooked too?\"\n\n“Actually, the best way to prepare it is to turn it into homebrew whiskey,” she said with a coy smile.\n\nShe reached under her stand and pulled out an unbranded glass bottle half-filled with a translucent red liquor. She raised it to her lips and took a swig, closing her eyes and savouring the mouthful for a moment before swallowing, then sighing in satisfaction.\n\nI arched my eyebrow at the implication that she had already drank the other half of the bottle, as I would have described her behaviour as buzzed at most, and that much hooch should have left her absolutely shit-faced.\n\n“Hmmm, yeah. Not meant for mere mortals,” she said, guessing my thoughts. “My brother makes this himself right here. He likes to use it for his cocktails, but I prefer Bloody Marys and martinis, so when I drink whiskey, it’s usually straight. They do make good Manhattans, though. I’d let you try a shot, but you have to drive so it might not be a good idea. I’d offer to sell you a bottle, but that wouldn’t exactly be legal. But… if you ran through the corn maze, it could be your prize, and there wouldn’t be anything illegal about that, now would there?”\n\n“Oh, so that’s the secret prize the sign mentioned?” I asked, a little amused with her underhanded business tactics. “How much?”\n\n“Twenty dollars, and it's yours,\" she said in a tempting, sing-song voice, waving an unopened bottle of corn liquor in front of me.\n\n“Alright, sold. Seven dollars for the corn, and twenty for the 'maze',\" I said, putting the exact change down on the stand. I reached for the bottle, only for her to pull it back.\n\n“Uh-huh. You’ve got to walk the maze first, Ducky,” she insisted.\n\n“Fine. And it’s Holsten, by the way,” I said, growing a little tired of her favoured epithet.\n\n“Mary. Mary Darling,” she reciprocated with a satisfied smile. Nodding, I marched off towards the maze to earn my bottle of bootleg whiskey. I only really noticed then that there were several other vehicles parked on the grass alongside the corn maze, but I hadn’t seen or heard any sign of anyone else yet.\n\n“How big is this maze, anyway?” I shouted back at her. She just shrugged as she took another swig of whiskey.\n\n“Depends on how good you are at solving it,” she shouted. “Oh, and keep an eye out for my brother! He likes to dress up as a scarecrow and scare people!”\n\nShaking my head in irritation, I stepped into the maze of crimson corn.\n\nThe instant I was inside, I was struck by how much darker and quieter everything was. The bloody red stalks loomed over me at more than seven feet tall, casting shadows in all directions. The corn was so tall and thick it seemed impenetrable, absorbing any ambient sound so that the only thing I could hear was the stalks rustling in the winds and my own feet crunching the straw beneath them. The sky seemed to darken as well, along with taking on a reddish hue, as if the sun had hastened its descent to the horizon. I dismissed it as an illusion caused by some sudden increase in cloud cover and the odd colour of my surroundings, and pressed onwards.\n\nThe maze offered only ninety-degree turns at randomly spaced junctions. I tried making only right-hand turns, but I quickly came upon several junctions where that wasn’t an option, as well as running into a couple of dead-ends and having to double back. Before long, I was completely disoriented and had no idea which way I had come from. I decided to give up on any sort of strategy for the time being and simply wander the maze at random.\n\nThere were signposts spaced out at irregular intervals, though none of them provided any useful information at all. The signs all had short, scary messages like ‘*Every Way Is The Wrong Way’*, *‘You Were Lost Before You Started’*, and *‘Don’t Scream. He’ll Hear You’*.\n\nSince these signs offered the only sort of landmark within the maze, I took out my phone to take a picture of each one I passed, in the hopes that they would help me find my way out. I saw that I had no signal, which wasn’t surprising given that I was a fair way out in the sticks, but it was enough to raise my anxiety a bit. I was technically lost, with no way to phone for help, and nobody knew where I was.\n\nI was so ensconced in thought that when I looked up from my phone, I nearly hollered out loud at the sight of a scarecrow rising over the corn. I remembered what the girl had said about her brother, and I struggled to tell if the scarecrow was a person or not. The lighting was terrible, and hanging off a post over twelve feet in the air put him at an awkward and unfamiliar angle. Craning my neck and squinting my eyes, I strained to make out every detail that I could.\n\nThe head was either covered in or made out of a tattered burlap mask with a jagged, crudely stitched mouth. There were eyeholes, but the space within them was too shadowed for me to tell whether or not it had any eyes. The burgundy shirt, coveralls, boots and work gloves had all seen better days, but none were so ragged as to provide a definitive view of human flesh beneath them. The scarecrow’s head was leaning downwards and pointed directly at me. In his right hand, he grasped a rusty sickle.\n\nI stood frozen in place for a moment, staring at the thing and waiting for any sign of movement. When I was sufficiently convinced that no living thing could remain so perfectly motionless for so long, I let out a sigh of relief and continued on my trek down the straw-laden path.\n\nJust as I had convinced myself that the girl probably didn’t even have a brother and that she had just been messing with me, I heard a loud thud cushioned by the crushing of straw under booted feet. I spun around and saw that the scarecrow had leapt from his post and was now standing upon the path. As he stared at me, I caught a glimpse of blue behind its mask, the same bright blue as the girl’s eyes had been.\n\n\"Shit!\" I cursed, taking a few stumbling steps back but fighting the urge to flee entirely. \"Listen, buddy, I'm just doing this to get the bottle of whiskey. I already paid your sister, this is just a technicality, so I’m not interested in this haunted maze schtick you got going on. Do you understand?”\n\nRaising his rusty sickle high into the air, he broke out into a sprint, cackling manically as he raced towards me.\n\nEven though I was still about eighty percent sure at that point that he was simply messing with me, the lingering twenty percent of doubt was more than enough to send me running like my life depended on it. I zigged and zagged down every turn I could in the hopes of losing the sickle-wielding scarecrow, not knowing what I would do if I went into a dead-end before I could lose him.\n\nA brief feeling of relief washed over me when I saw another person walk out of a junction and into the path ahead of me. He looked as confounded as I was by the situation, but unharmed, indicating perhaps that this was just an unusually elaborate roadside attraction, after all.\n\nHe wasn’t able to see the scarecrow behind me, however, since the pathway was too narrow.\n\n“Whoa, hey! What are you doing?” he shouted as I nearly ran him over, pushing him aside and continuing on my way. But when I heard him scream, followed by the sound of steel slicing across flesh and his body thudding against the ground, I had to look back.\n\nThe man was lying down with his head to the side and his throat slit open, the blood gurgling in his throat and frothing in his mouth as he still desperately struggled to breathe. The scarecrow knelt upon his lap and plunged his sickle into his abdomen, slicing through his stomach with a practiced, surgical precision. He had quite deliberately avoided the vital organs, drawing out the kill for as long as he could, what little I could see of his face spasming in manic giddy as he watched his victim suffer beneath him.\n\nHe wasn’t dead yet. Maybe I could have helped. Maybe I could have fought the scarecrow off him and got the man to a hospital before he had lost too much blood. I don’t know. I only know that I didn’t, instead taking advantage of the scarecrow’s preoccupation with his victim to put as much space between him and myself as I could.\n\nNight fell immediately after that, with a full blood moon rising in the sky, its red light the only illumination any of us had to evade the things that hunted us. I say *us* because I heard the other victims in the labyrinth, even if I never ran into any more of them while they were still alive. I heard terrified children screaming for their parents, desperate parents screaming for their children, panic-stricken adults screaming like children, and all of them screaming in agony as they fell before the scarecrow’s sickle.\n\nThere was also a woman laughing psychotically alongside the squealing and trampling hoofs of swine, so I could only conclude that Mary wasn’t a mere accomplice but an active participant in this massacre. Just like with the first man, I never offered any help. I just ran as far as I could as fast as I could while making as little noise as possible. Given how long I lasted without running into the scarecrow or his lackeys again, this was apparently a winning strategy.\n\nI tried to get off the path, of course, desperate to hide among the corn stalks and possibly escape the field just by running straight for as long as it took, but it was impossible. The stalks were unbreakable and had been sown too close together to squeeze between. The more I pushed them, the more they seemed to push back, their rustling transforming into a vicious hissing sound.\n\nI was able to pluck some cobs, the closest thing to defensive weapons that I could get my hands on. Their red kernels gleamed like drops of blood in the crimson moonlight, throbbing rapidly with my own racing heartbeat. The same corn that had seemed uniquely beautiful in the broad light of day were monstrous abominations to me now, and I detested touching them, but I needed something, anything, to use as a weapon.\n\nI lost all track of time in that disorienting and monstrously mammoth maze, constantly on the run and pumped full of adrenaline, but eventually, I felt as exhausted as if I had run a full marathon. Shambling forward, I lurched down another path, barely even aware that I was staggering into a dead-end.\n\nWhen I finally looked up, I stopped in my tracks, seeing that the scarecrow was crouched in front of a freshly dead body. It was a boy, around ten years old, and the scarecrow had used his sickle to cut the top of his skull clean off.\n\n“I’m afraid I’m going to be needing your brain, young man,” the scarecrow said to his victim, gently petting the exposed grey matter. “Cliché as it sounds, I don’t have one of my own.”\n\n*“But how can you speak if you don’t have a brain?”* the dead child asked with an equally dead expression, his voice flat and his jaw moving up and down like a ventriloquist’s dummy. Somehow, the scarecrow was using the boy’s body as a puppet.\n\n*“Well, I’m not sure, but some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don’t they?”* the scarecrow quoted. Smiling, he plunged his hand into the boy’s open skull, grabbing his brain and tearing it free with a single strong tug. He squeezed it slightly, causing it to drip blood onto his hand and onto the ground below. “Let’s see if this helps, shall we?”\n\nLooking directly at me, he placed the brain upon his head, wearing it like a raw, blood-drenched hat.\n\n*“The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an Isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side!”* he quoted again, smiling perversely through freshly made tears in his mask.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, I threw my cobs of corn at him. He sliced one of them mid-air with his sickle, but the rest of them didn’t even get close enough for him to bother with. With a condescending stare, he waited for me to make the next move. Deciding that fleeing would be slightly less futile than fighting, I turned around and limped down another path as fast as my wobbly legs would go, my gasps turning more and more into sobs with every step.\n\nI didn’t hear the scarecrow giving chase, but in a few seconds, it was clear why. I had run straight into a large, square clearing at the end of the maze, where all the other victim’s bodies had been piled up on a skid to block my path to freedom. One of them had been savagely ripped open, their viscera and entrails haphazardly scattered about like a paint-filled balloon splattered upon a canvas. Mary was there, wallowing naked in the gore alongside her pigs, each of them coated red in their victim’s blood.\n\nThe pigs’ greedily chomped away at whatever body part was within reach of their snouts, while Mary used a butcher’s knife to saw off fistfuls of flesh and devoured them with a feral madness. I just stared too dumbstruck to react, too petrified to even try to make my way past them to the exit, until I felt the scarecrow place his hand on my shoulder and poke his sickle against my back.\n\n“You were supposed to say *‘That’s a right triangle, you idiot!’*,” he said, and I felt the warm, squishy brain being shoved on top of my head. “I think you need that more than I do. Oh, Mary Darling!”\n\nAt his call, I saw a flicker of lucidity replace the animalistic instinct in her eyes. Despite the absence of clothing and abundance of other people’s vital fluids upon her body, she assumed a polite and dignified pose as she rose to speak with him.\n\n“Yes, James Darling?” she smiled at him, her accent distinctly less rural than it had been when we spoke earlier.\n\n“This is our last victim, if my count’s right, and I thought I should see what you’d like done with him before I do anything too irreversible,” he explained as he pushed me closer towards her. I was too exhausted and terrified to offer any protest or resistance, aside from some reflexive whimpering and gasping. If I was going to fight back, it would only be to provoke them into killing me quickly instead of whatever grim torture they might have planned.\n\n“Oh, that’s so thoughtful, James Darling,” she beamed at him. “Hmm, let’s see. My bloodlust feels pretty well sated, and I think I must have at least five pounds of raw flesh inside of me. I need to leave some room for a nightcap or I’ll wake up with the shakes. We’ve got more than enough for the larder and market until our next hunt, so unless you’re just itching for one more kill, I say we let him go and call it a night.”\n\nThe largest of the pigs seemed to grunt distastefully at this suggestion, eyeing me with the same hungry look as he had before.\n\n“Hmmm. He does have another victim’s DNA on him; a child’s, no less,” the scarecrow said thoughtfully. “Letting him go like this would be hilarious.”\n\n“Looks like you’re outvoted, Orwell,” Mary shouted back to the lead pig, before pointing her bloody knife directly at my heart. “Don’t you get too comfortable though, Ducky. We may come after you again in the future, or we may not. It'd be fun, but we might just plumb forget about you. For you, this is the worst day of your life. But for us, it's a Tuesday. A good Tuesday, though.\"\n\nShe yawned and stretched before looking past me again to speak with her brother.\n\n“James Darling, I’m too tired to hose off first, so I’m going to plop down here with the pigs so I don’t mess up the residence. Just get rid of him, stick the bodies in the larder, and come join us when you’re done,” she told him.\n\nI felt something sharp pierce my backside, and at first, I assumed it was the scarecrow’s sickle, but quickly realized it had been a syringe of some kind. I saw Mary herd her pigs together and lay down up against them as she swigged her nightcap from another bottle of whiskey before I lost consciousness.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in police custody. I had been abandoned naked on the side of the road, with the child’s brain still on my head, and the scarecrow’s sickle in my hand. I’m now being held without bail as the prime suspect in not only his murder, but the disappearance and presumed murder of the seven other victims as well, since that sickle had DNA from each and every one of them on it. My lawyer is going to try to convince the jury that I am, in fact, another victim of the real killers, and that the more fantastical elements of my story are the results of trauma and being drugged.\n\nBut there’s no evidence to back up my story. The corn maze is just gone! The sign’s gone, the weird box I saw on the archway is gone, and the driveway just leads to an abandoned lot. The toxicology report showed there was nothing special about what the scarecrow used to put me out, and the bastard made sure to prick my back in a place that I could have reached myself.\n\nI know my odds of winning over a jury aren’t great, but I’m not too worried about that now. This morning, I woke up wearing the scarecrow’s mask. The Darlings haven’t forgotten about me, and they want me to know that even in county jail, they can get to me whenever they want.\n\nI guess Mary’s pigs aren’t going to have to settle for corn much [longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/) [after](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/) [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/).",

        "text": "\nNew chat\n\n￼￼\n\nCan you Wright a r/nosleep\n\nSure, here is a short \"r/nosleep\" story:\n\nTitle: The Watcher in the Woods\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night when I first saw it. I was on a camping trip with some friends, and we decided to take a hike through the woods despite the weather. We were all huddled under a single umbrella, trying to stay dry, when I saw a movement out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look and there it was - a figure standing in the distance, watching us.\n\nI froze, my heart pounding in my chest. My friends didn't seem to notice, and they pulled me along, chattering about how much fun the hike was. But I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched.\n\nAs the days went on, I couldn't shake the feeling that the figure was following us. Whenever we were in the woods, I could feel its eyes on me. I tried to tell my friends, but they just laughed and told me I was imagining things.\n\nOn the last night of the trip, I couldn't take it anymore. I confronted my friends, telling them that I knew we were being followed. They still didn't believe me, and they told me to stop being paranoid.\n\nThat night, I couldn't sleep. I lay in my tent, staring at the ceiling, listening to the rain pound against the fabric. And then I heard it - the sound of footsteps outside my tent. I sat up, my heart racing, and I unzipped the door.\n\nThere it was, standing just outside my tent - the figure from the woods. I couldn't see its face, but I could feel its eyes on me. I was rooted to the spot, unable to move. And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it was gone.\n\nI never spoke of that night to my friends again. But I know what I saw, and I know that there is something out there in the woods, watching and waiting.\n\nHope you like it!\n\n2 / 2\n\n￼￼\n\nCan you write one about the Appalachian mountains\n\nSure, here's a short \"r/nosleep\" story set in the Appalachian mountains:\n\nTitle: The Hiker's Lament\n\nI've been hiking the Appalachian mountains for years, and I've seen some strange things out there in the wilderness. But nothing prepared me for what I saw on my last trip.\n\nI was alone, as I often am on my hikes. I like the peace and quiet of being out in nature by myself. But on this trip, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination. But as the days went on, the feeling grew stronger. I started to see shadows moving in the corner of my eye, and I heard strange noises in the middle of the night.\n\nI tried to ignore it and continue on with my hike, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me.\n\nOn the fourth night, I set up camp near a small stream. I was exhausted and decided to turn in early. But I was awakened in the middle of the night by a strange noise. I opened my eyes and saw a figure standing at the edge of my campsite. It was tall and thin, with long arms and legs, and its skin was a sickly pale color. I couldn't see its face, but I could feel its eyes on me.\n\nI froze, unable to move or even scream. The figure stood there for what felt like an eternity, watching me. And then, as suddenly as it appeared, it was gone.\n\nI packed up my things and hiked out as fast as I could. I never went back to the Appalachian mountains again.\n\nBut I can still feel its eyes on me, even now, as I sit and write this. I can only hope that it was just my imagination, and that the figure I saw was not real. But deep down, I know that it was real and it's still out there, watching and waiting.\n\nI hope you like it! Let me know if you have any other request.\n\n￼￼\n\nCan you Wright a short scary story about cave spulunking\n\nSure, here's a short \"r/nosleep\" story about cave spelunking:\n\nTitle: The Darkness Below\n\nI've always been fascinated by caves and the mysteries they hold deep within the earth. So when my friends invited me to go spelunking in a remote cave system in the mountains, I jumped at the chance.\n\nWe arrived at the cave entrance in the early morning and began our descent. The cave was dark and damp, and the only light came from our headlamps. We moved slowly, carefully navigating the twisting tunnels and narrow passageways.\n\nAs we descended deeper into the cave, the air grew colder and the silence was almost deafening. We were the only ones down there and it felt like we were the first ones to set foot in the cave.\n\nBut as we turned a corner, we saw something that made our blood run cold. Scrawled on the cave wall in what looked like blood was a single word: \"LEAVE.\" We paused for a moment, trying to make sense of what we were seeing. But before we could even speak, we heard a sound that made our hearts race - the sound of footsteps coming from deep within the cave.\n\nWe didn't waste any time. We turned and ran, our headlamps bouncing wildly as we scrambled through the dark tunnels. But the footsteps were getting closer and closer, and we knew we couldn't outrun whatever was chasing us.\n\nWe stumbled and fell, crawling on our hands and knees to try and get away. But the darkness was all around us, and we were lost in the maze of caves. We could hear the thing behind us, its breath hot on our necks, and we knew we were going to die down there in the darkness.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, we saw a light. We couldn't believe it - it was the cave entrance, and we had made it out alive. We emerged from the cave, gasping for breath, and we never spoke of what had happened in the cave again.\n\nBut I know that something was down there with us, something that should not have been there. And I can't shake the feeling that it's still down there, waiting for its next victims.\n\nI hope you like it! Let me know if you want me to write another one.\n\n￼￼\n\nCan you expand on this and make it longer. \n\nSure, here's a longer version of the story about cave spelunking:\n\nTitle: The Darkness Below\n\nI've always been fascinated by caves and the mysteries they hold deep within the earth.

Let me know if you have any other request.\n\n￼￼\n\nCan you make this into a short novel\n\nSure, here's a short novel based on the story of cave spelunking:\n\nTitle: The Darkness Below\n\nI've always been fascinated by caves and the mysteries they hold deep within the earth. So when my friends invited me to go spelunking in a remote cave system in the mountains, I jumped at the chance. We had planned this trip for months and we were all excited to explore the unknown.\n\nThe cave was located in a remote area and it was known for being one of the most challenging caves in the region. But that's what made it so exciting. We arrived at the cave entrance in the early morning and began our descent. The cave was dark and damp, and the only light came from our headlamps. We moved slowly, carefully navigating the twisting tunnels and narrow passageways. We were all experienced cavers but we knew that we were going to be facing some challenges that day.\n\nAs we descended deeper into the cave, the air grew colder and the silence was almost deafening. We were the only ones down there and it felt like we were the first ones to set foot in the cave. We were in awe of the beauty of the cave and we were all taking pictures and videos of the cave formations, the stalactites and stalagmites. We made our way through the cave, marveling at the beauty of the underground world.\n\nBut as we turned a corner, we saw something that made our blood run cold. Scrawled on the cave wall in what looked like blood was a single word: \"LEAVE.\" We paused for a moment, trying to make sense of what we were seeing. But before we could even speak, we heard a sound that made our hearts race - the sound of footsteps coming from deep within the cave.\n\nWe didn't waste any time.

We were running out of options and our only hope was to find a way out of the cave.\n\nAs the hours passed, we became more and more disoriented and our nerves were frayed. We were running out of water and food, and the batteries of our headlamps were running low. We were starting to lose hope, and we knew that our chances of survival were slim.\n\nBut just when all hope seemed lost, we saw a light. It was the cave entrance, and we had made it out alive. We emerged from the cave, gasping for breath, and we never spoke of what had happened in the cave again. But, as we were leaving the cave, we saw something that gave us chills. The word \"LEAVE\" was written in blood, not only on the cave wall but also on the cave entrance.\n\nWe were all shaken by the experience and we couldn't shake the feeling that something was down there with us, something that should not have been there. And I can't shake the feeling that it's still down there, waiting for its next victims.\n\nAfter that experience, we never went back to the cave, and we never spoke of it again. But the memory of that cave and the thing we encountered will haunt us forever.",

        "text": "You’re all going to find out some stuff about Grayson [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103p0s3/how_to_survive_college_im_becoming_bffs_with_the/).  Personal stuff.  I’m not entirely sure I should be sharing it like this but at least this is anonymous, right?  I am going to ask for one thing, though.  I know wild speculation is pretty much the norm for all of you and I do appreciate it - it’s so helpful to have other ideas to consider, after all.  Also sometimes I need to be able to laugh about everything that’s going on.  But for certain things regarding Grayson, I don’t want to hear anything but respect for his situation.  You’ll know what I’m talking about when you get there, trust me.\n\nNothing but respect.\n\nOr I’ll stop updating you about anything that involves him.  You’ll never see me type out his name ever again.  \n\nGot it?\n\nOkay.\n\nI finally went to dinner with Grayson.\n\n (if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/)) \n\nI’d been guilting myself into giving him an answer with little success.  I guess I’d rather live with the self-loathing about my own indecision than do anything to actually relieve it.  However, something happened that forced me to make a decision.  \n\nDaniel needs help.  Desperately.  And we haven’t found any solutions for him yet.\n\nI really am better at doing things for other people than for myself.\n\nWe’ve been keeping in touch with him via group text.  He updates us about the scratching at the door every time he hears it… which is most nights.  I think he’s staying up late enough to hear it, sends us a text about whether he thinks it’s louder than before or anything else he notices, and only then he goes to bed.  We’ve tried a few things to dissuade the larva but with no success.  \n\nI tried opening one of the other doors in the hallway but it was locked and when I shook and pounded on it, nothing answered.  We considered breaking one open, but we decided against that in case it was another steam tunnel situation and we’d wind up somewhere weird.  It’s still on the list of things to try, but we have some other options to get through first.\n\nOne of those being the insecticide route.  It took four tries.  Maria was the one who succeeded.  There wasn’t anything physically impeding us from throwing a bucket of chemicals on the thing.  It was that weird sluggishness of our thoughts that got in the way.  Like everything slowed down and started skipping over the actions we needed to take.  And when I tried to figure out what I was there for, I managed to look back and then - bam - I was back at the start of the hallway and the larva was far in the distance.\n\nMaria managed to pull through, though.  I had argued about her going into the hallway at all, but she’d snapped that it was only right that she help, and *besides*, that thing wasn’t dangerous to us.\n\n“It’s not dangerous until it gets a facefull of chemicals,” I muttered.\n\nBut then she’d grabbed the bucket and stormed off down the hallway and after that I didn’t have much of an argument.  She succeeded in remembering what she needed to do on her second attempt.  Got the insecticide right in its face.\n\nAaaaaaand nothing happened.\n\nSo we’re still looking for answers.  I did put up a charm bundle on his door, and my own for good measure.  And Maria’s.  I called Tyler and asked if he’d send me a couple.  Told him that it’d make my mom feel better.\n\nI didn’t actually tell my mom I was doing this.  She’s a bit sensitive about the inhuman and maybe it’d make her feel better or maybe it’d remind her of how dad just… vanished, out there in the fields.  I don’t know and I’m not gonna find out.\n\nNot much time had passed after the failed poisoning attempt and we were diligently trying to figure out what to try next (we’re thinking fire, but we want to make sure we can get away with a) smuggling it in and b) use it without setting ourselves on fire in the process) but Daniel was silently cracking under the strain.  He could only be brave for so long and then one day, he snapped.\n\nFortunately, the way he handled his mental breakdown was by showing up at my dorm crying.  Someone recognized him in the lobby and knew they’d seen him hanging out with me before, so they let him up to my floor.  That’s how I was sitting there, minding my own business with the dorm door open, then suddenly he was there in the doorway sobbing messily.\n\nCassie is aware of the situation, as I had to reassure her that I wasn’t about to “make bad dating choices” (her words, not mine) again when I started spending half the night at his dorm.  Once he was inside our room, she quietly excused herself to fill up the eclectic kettle for tea and shut the door behind her.\n\nI didn’t get a word out before Daniel was yanking his sleeves up and shoving both arms in my direction, palms up.\n\n“It’s getting worse!” he said.  “Look.  Look!”\n\nScratches.  He wasn’t drawing blood, but he was scratching.\n\n“I didn’t even realize I was doing it until the hour was up,” he continued.  “I was sitting there, listening to the scratching, and then it got quiet and I looked down and my arms were all red and they hurt.  How can I just - just *sit there* and not realize what I’m doing!?”\n\n“Uh, the inhuman has a way of messing with you-”\n\n“I know!” he howled.  “But what do I do about it?”\n\nHe collapsed onto our futon and buried his head in his hands.  He took a deep breath and then another.  I awkwardly handed him a box of tissues, even though he’d stopped crying.\n\n“I might have an idea,” I said.  “Maria can keep figuring out the whole gasoline thing and I can follow up on this.”\n\nHe eyed me suspiciously.  I can’t blame him.  His life is literally on the line, if I were him I’d want to be absolutely certain the people saying they’d help me weren’t just trying to make me feel better.\n\n“I know someone that might have access to more information,” I continued.  “I’ll see if I can get them involved.”\n\n“And what do I do?” he asked hollowly.  He sounded hopeless.\n\n“Keep making your log of what is happening every night.  We know what the pattern is, so let’s see if we can find a crack in it.  If it keeps getting worse… we’ll try tying your hands down for the night.”\n\nHe was worried enough that he didn’t even try to make the obvious joke (and I stg I don’t want to see it in the comments).  Somewhat reassured, he left just as Cassie was returning with the water.  She stepped aside to let him pass and then put it on to boil anyway, raising an eyebrow at me and waiting for an explanation.\n\n“I need your help picking out an outfit,” I sighed, picking up my phone.  “Something nice.  Like… church nice.”\n\nThen I texted Grayson that I’d like to take him up on that offer of dinner.\n\nThere aren’t any rich people where I grew up so I had no idea what to expect when Grayson picked me up the next evening.  He was also dressed nicely in a button-up shirt, which I guess it might be weird to dress up for dinner at your own house, but maybe he suspected that I’d be dressed up and didn’t want me to feel out of place.  Or maybe that’s just what you do when you’re the son of a university president.  Either way, it cemented in my mind what I was expecting to find.  A big house.  A yard with a cobblestone driveway and marble statues flanking the entrance.  A dinner prepared by a hired chef.\n\nThe reality was underwhelming.  My expectations had been set way too high. Certainly, it was the nicest house I’ve ever been in, but it certainly wasn’t a mansion.  Just an old brick house with slate shingles, a well-tended yard with tasteful landscaping (and Grayson said they did hire someone to take care of that), and a two-car garage with new but practical cars.  The interior featured a lot of brickwork and wood floors.  My house back home has wood floors, but they’re old and in desperate need of resurfacing after years of abuse from a family full of kids.  Grayson’s house looked like it’d been installed yesterday.  The rest of the house was similarly perfect, immaculately clean and decorated in a tasteful, but unassuming sort of way - the kind of interior you’d expect to see in a magazine article.  ‘Farmhouse chic - 101 ways to look rustic but also stylish and spend a lot of money in doing so.’  That sort of thing.\n\n“Only the first floor is like this,” Grayson whispered to me as I stood there awkwardly in the entryway, afraid to touch *anything.*\n\n“Do you get guests a lot or something?” I whispered back.\n\nHe nodded, but didn’t reply, because his dad was coming in to greet us both.\n\nHis dad… well, my mental image was of someone tall (which now in retrospect is a stupid assumption because Grayson is short) and imposing, deceptively strong and maybe wearing glasses on a nose that has a hint of being broken in the past.  The kind of person that appears respectable but could throw down if it came to it.  In short, the kind of person that could run a university full of monsters.\n\nI was wrong on that as well.\n\nHis dad is a dumpling.  A watery dumpling.\n\nHe tottered over to us and seized my hand, forcing out a thin smile and saying it was good to meet me.  He’d heard so much from Grayson.  He called me by name, but the name he used was ‘Luke’.\n\nBehind him, Grayson shot me an apologetic smile over his dad’s shoulder.  Then his dad released my hand and before I could say anything, he meandered back the way he came, saying he’d check to see if the pork was done yet.\n\n“I, uh, had probably better go with him,” Grayson said.  “I actually do all the cooking.”\n\n“*Luke?*” I hissed.\n\n“He, uh, well.”  Grayson blew out a nervous breath.  “You’ll see.”\n\nI wandered around downstairs as much as I dared while Grayson finished up in the kitchen.  I could hear him talking to his dad, mostly telling him to put things down and stop helping.  Finally, Grayson reemerged and announced everything was ready.\n\nThey have two dining tables.  Like.  Who has two tables?  But I guess that’s what happens when you have a largish house and there’s a dining room.  We were eating at the kitchen table, which was significantly less formal than the dining room and I was quite grateful for that.  I didn’t really want to eat in a room with a hammered tin??? ceiling and wood panel walls and the portraits of former university presidents staring at me.  I get the feeling that the room is reserved for the important guests, the ones that donate lots of money to have buildings named after them and stuff.  I got to sit at the kitchen table, which was separated from the actual kitchen by a half wall, and I was very grateful for that.\n\nGrayson led most of the conversation.  He made sure to pause every now and then and let his dad say something.  It quickly became apparent why Grayson was so reluctant to talk about his family and why he wanted me to see it in person.\n\nThere’s something wrong with Grayson’s dad and no, it’s not normal medical something wrong.  I think that might be easier.  At least you could understand it and there’d be a prognosis and a timeline to expect.  This… it’s like he’s only present when talking about the university.  Grayson gently reminded him of who Ashley was and he followed along for a little while, then started calling me ‘Alice’ which I suppose is closer than ‘Luke’.  \n\nBut when Grayson mentioned his classes?  His dad changed.  His eyes grew sharp and he sat up straighter.  He no longer looked like a dumpling, squashed in on himself with his head hunkered between his shoulders.  He smiled and asked me if I was enjoying mine, so I told him I was majoring in geology.\n\n“Oh, then you’ve taken the introductory class with Professor L,” he said.  “And this semester… you’d be in the class that covers dinosaurs, right?”\n\nI said that I did, though I admitted it could be dry at times.  He laughed.\n\n“You can say it’s boring,” he chuckled.  “I keep telling him to abandon the slideshow presentations, but he has his system all worked out… ah well.”\n\nHe continued on that track for a little while, asking about my general education requirements and if I was getting good help from my advisor.  I said that Professor L. actually looked my schedule over and he nodded thoughtfully, distracted for a moment.  I felt a little bad.  I might have gotten the advising office in trouble.\n\nThen Grayson changed the topic to something going on in town, outside of the university’s influence, and his father shriveled up again, nodding absently.  His mashed potatoes fell off onto the plate and he put an empty spoon in his mouth without noticing.\n\n“I’m going to go get dessert,” Grayson said abruptly.  “I’ll be a moment.  It’s in the basement fridge because I ran out of room upstairs.”\n\nThis was my chance.  I took a deep breath.  As soon as I heard Grayson’s steps on the stairs, I looked at his dad and asked my question.\n\n“Do you know anything about a scratching in the dorms?” I asked, trying to sound casual, even though my heart was pounding.  “A friend of mine says there’s something scratching at his door every night.”\n\nAgain, that shift.  This time, however, his dad got up from his chair.  He walked over to where I was sitting, frozen in shock and confusion.  There was a wild, dark look on the man’s face.  His features were strained, like every muscle in his body had gone tight all at once.\n\n“You… heard… *nothing*,” he hissed, towering over me.\n\nI remembered Daniel’s sobbing.  His hopeless, hollow stare.  I *made* myself remember.\n\n“Please,” I whimpered.  “My friend is going to die.”\n\nThe president’s hand shot out and seized my shoulder.  His knuckles dug into my skin like marbles.\n\n“He has to kill it.”\n\nThen his gaze shifted.  He wasn’t looking at me any longer.  He was looking somewhere else, his stare still fixed on my face, but he didn’t see me.  He was somewhere else, somewhere far away.  His eyes were wide and his breathing was short, panicked gasps.  He reminded me of a fish, tossed up onto land, convulsing and flailing to find its way back home.\n\n“Before it gets too big.”\n\nWhat was I doing?  I started to panic.  There was something clearly wrong with Grayson’s dad and I’d agitated him, I’d awakened *something* and I couldn’t undo it.  I regretted coming here.  I regretted asking.  \n\nThe only way out was through.  I had to find out what I came here for.\n\n“I was told it couldn’t be killed,” I gasped.\n\n“It’s the only way.”\n\nI stared pleadingly up into his watery gray eyes, bloodshot and peeled open as far as they could go.  I felt like my shoulder would crack under his grip.  Desperately, I looked about, wishing Grayson would return and save me from my own mistakes.\n\nWait.  The laundry lady had said I couldn’t stop it and I assumed that was just her low opinion of me, but what if… what if she were speaking literally?\n\n“I was told… *I* couldn’t kill it,” I said.  “Is.. is my friend the one that has to do it?”\n\n“Before it gets too big,” he whispered.\n\nThen he let go, walked back to his seat, and sat back down with a huff, like a balloon deflating.  I sat there for a moment more, heart racing, and then I looked up and Grayson was standing in the doorway, holding a cheesecake in front of him with both hands.  The expression on his face told me that he knew what had just happened.\n\nNo one talked much for the rest of dinner.  \n\nGrayson took a winding route back to campus when he drove me home.  I thought he wanted to talk, but he was quiet for a good long while and finally, when we were on main street heading towards campus again, I broke the silence.\n\n“Is it… okay if I ask where your mom is?” I ventured.\n\nI’m not sure why I asked that. I guess… I wanted to know if he was alone in dealing with this.  I guess… I’m worried for him.\n\nBut his jaw went tight.\n\n“She’s not in the picture,” he said, in that evasive way that people use when they don’t want to say ‘messy divorce’ outloud.  \n\nI didn’t pry further, because I think I know a little bit about what that feels like.  When dad vanished, there was a small contingent in town that wasted no opportunity to announce that *they* believed he’d bailed on us.  Nevermind that mom was scared, my younger siblings were confused, and I just wanted to scream and scream until the world around me stopped and I was finally left with silence.  So I’d be damned if I opened my mouth and said a single word about Grayson’s situation and became anything like them.\n\n“He’s getting worse,” Grayson said, his hands tight around the steering wheel.\n\n“Do you know who did this to him?” I asked.\n\n“The rain,” he whispered.  “The rain did it.”\n\nThen we were pulling up just outside my dorm and I awkwardly said goodbye and I went to my room, feeling like I’d done something terrible.  Like I’d hurt him through my carelessness, through my stupidity, that he’d shared something very painful with me and I took advantage of it to get my own questions answered.\n\nI’d call myself selfish if I wasn’t trying to save Daniel.\n\nI just hope it was worth it.

        "text": " As I lay my head upon my pillow, I dream my dream of sorrow. A dream of lust. Something I will never obtain. What is after death? This question plagued me like a sweet tune stuck in my head, my eternal thought day and night. My life was pestered with the thought of one day perishing from underneath the sun and becoming lost. These days it has been lost on me, money fame and fortune had not come easy. And once it had come, I did not want it. Take the dagger out of my heart and let me rest. Let me rest, but how long will I rest? Will I be awoken with the magnificent clash of thunder? Or will I cease to exist, just some ash scattered across the sea and finally resting at the bottom of the ocean. Dare I think of where I will end up? Questions, all these questions are too hard for me to handle. Stop this, I can’t handle it. Will I get to see my family again, or will I forever be alone. Whatever will await me in the next life I am terrified of so, or is there even such a thing? At night I lay still and close my eyes, just to imagine what it is like to be gone. Your whole life gone, was it worth the while? Was it worth the hardship and hate and love or lust. Will you be remembered, or will you be forgotten? Many questions raised here, and many will remain unanswered, scoff at me for thinking of this. Will I be remembered? No, cast my dust upon the soil and return me to what I once was. No, what if I don’t want to go. I’ve still got things to do, people I love. They can’t take me, it won’t take me.\n\nMy body is hurting with the pain it causes itself, the constant torture device that straps itself to my bones. Will this ever end, I doubt it. A figure appears on the side, it’s asking me to go. I take a step back in hesitation but not for long. The searing heat of its eyes tear into my soul, if I go any longer I will surely be burnt to a cinder. “take me” I yell as he grabs me and pulls me behind the wall of sleep. I look into his eyes and it’s me, I can’t believe it. It’s me, my face staring back at me. The man figure wears a black robe, and a mirror for a face. I am staring back at myself, cold and darkness gathers around me, I can hear dirt dropping from above. I can see him still staring at me, staring at myself. “Who are you!” I yell at its face. “I am the Eternal Footman; your inquisitiveness has bought me here”. “I did not want nor ask you to take me, please send me back”. “You asked to be shown the meaning and end of life. You worry about this often; do you want to see?” My heart stops, I still breath but my heart stops, I can’t breathe but I still think. My bones begin to stiffen, oh good lord its happening, why me. Oh, please show me what I’ve come to see. “Very well” He turns me around and I see it, I see what we are, the place thereafter we die. It’s so simple, it makes sense. \n\nThis whole story is a lie and it was made by the person who reads it.",

        "text": "In this specific dream my mother and i went to visit her friends house, but had ended up staying the night. i don’t know specifically what friend it was, but it didn’t feel unusual because growing up we’d often spend the night at other peoples houses. If anything this dream was feeling very nostalgic. Anyways, i remember being shown to the room where i’d sleep. i also remember immediately getting into bed, and just laying there. i don’t know i just started staring off at the ceiling as my eyes got heavy, but just before falling asleep i turned to my right side and i noticed a twin size bed (same as mine) i for some reason didn’t notice before. i also hadn’t noticed the boy already sleeping in said bed, but for some reason i shrugged it off as this room being his and him probably being the son of my moms friend. i wasn’t too bothered by this because it wasn’t that unusual of an experience for me. After that i closed my eyes ready to doze off, but then all of a sudden i felt this awful sensation of fear fall over me as i felt arms wrap around me. I started to panic, but i couldn’t move out of fear of whatever was embracing me. i remember hesitating but eventually deciding to open my eyes, and as i had thought it was the boy who was previously laying on the bed across from me. I don’t know why but for some reason i had told myself that he would leave eventually so i decided to close my eyes and wait the whole thing out. This is where i realized how wrong i was. No, the boy didn’t leave but instead squeezed tighter and tighter to the point where i was losing air and was struggling to breathe. As i was suffocating i was trying to fight him off just to get him to loosen his grip even just a little bit. while this was all going down i had somehow realized i was dreaming, so i had tried to imagine myself in a different setting. i tried to picture my bedroom, and after doing that i had gotten myself to transfer?? to my own room. oh yes my room, my room without the murderous boy, my room without the feeling of intense suffocation. Except i was wrong….the feeling of suffocating was still there. Yes the boy may have been gone but not this heinous feeling, so i tried a different approach. This time i tried to actually wake myself up, because if i didn’t it felt as if i could actually die. I didn’t wake up though…not until i heard my mothers voice call my name. i remember hearing her whisper-yell come from outside my bedroom door. i woke up immediately upon hearing my name and i looked towards my bedroom door, but there was no one there. That night i was the only one home….you see my mom worked the night shifts at her job during that time. I’ve been thinking about this more lately,and i realized something creepy. the voice that called out my name that night said my legal first name….my mom rarely calls me that, and most (if not all) of the time she’ll use a nickname to address me. i’ve come to the conclusion that it might’ve sounded like my mom, but it was definitely something else that woke me that night. \n\n\nI think that whatever it is was looking out for me, or maybe it was just me creating a voice in my head to wake myself up. i don’t know it just felt like something was there that night, and i couldn’t fall back asleep after that.",

        "text": "Come moon rise, this road turns into a highway for hell’s freakiest and deakiest people. Hulken is not for the faint, fickle or skiddish: it was built for chaos.\n\nI grew up here In Hulken .My parents married in Santa Monica, yet decided to settle in a shit-hole opposite of a craggy coast. My home was built by my father and my uncle in a matter of months; nine to be exact. I was born right on the porch of that shitty shelter. It was never a home.\n\nBy the time I turned 7, my parents had made something of themselves. They opened a shop in the town’s main commercial strip and were doing well. I was a happy child. All my needs were met and then some. My parents smiled and hugged all day while running the shop but slept in separate bedrooms at home. They loved me and reminded me every single day. At some point though, they started forgetting to say it to each other. \n\nAround my 11th birthday my dad adopted a new catchphrase.\n“We’re doing great” \nHis teeth were rotting from the tobacco he chewed, but sure, he’s “doing great.” My mother was happy with working alongside her husband. She became an ideal wife; she was no longer an ideal mother. I could count the number of times she smiled at me annually on one hand. I never got the sibling I asked for, and eventually stopped asking once my father brought home a kitten. It was the smallest thing I’ve ever seen, and the cutest. I named him Shiret, after a comic book character I liked at the time. He was my best friend. Shiret was “mischievous” according to my dad: I disagree\nHe had a habit of getting his paws into the coolest adventures and always made sure I tailed closely behind him. \n\nNot many people in Hulken had pets. They’re a superstitious bunch. Cats especially, seemed to ward of the townsfolk en masse. I never felt the need to be wary of my pet; that was until the day he brought home an ear. It didn’t belong to any wild animal I recognized. It was small, roughly the size of a quail egg, and covered in thin-wiry-gray hairs.  He dropped it onto the back porch step, a few inches away from were I’d been peacefully daydreaming. It didn’t look like he himself had torn it off of the poor creature; rather like he’d found it laying somewhere. It reeked too. There was black matter coagulated on the side I assume was once attached to the thing. It really reeked: in a repulsive and sweet way. \nI couldn’t look at it anymore so I picked Shiret up, kicked it unto the brush and went inside. I didn’t dwell on it for too long and enough time passed for me to forget about it. \n\nThat year, the first major snowfall came in mid November. I walked home with my neighbors that day. When I made it to the back porch I saw Shiret waiting for me outside. He had something white in his mouth. Snow? I remember thinking. As I crouched down I saw something thin and wet draping from the white ball. I realized what it was even before he dropped it proudly by my feet. It was an eye.\nLike the ear, it was decaying in some parts; the iris a grey opaque. Despite the cold, I could still smell the rot. I was upset with him. This was intentional but I couldn’t understand what it meant.\n\nOnce we were both inside of my room I chastised him. I doubt he understood. Instead he wore this drôle expression, as if waiting for me to finish. I made sure to lock the windows that night ti ensure he didn’t get out. I fell asleep with him sitting beside my head. He was licking his paws and I felt a small surge of disgust. I thought back to the parts of that thing he’d returned home with. My thoughts drifted until they lulled to nothingness. \n\nShiret’s paws were kneading my cheek as I groggily opened my eyes. My room was black, despite the moon being visible through my window. I felt someone watching me. Shiret stopped pawing at me and dropped something warm and wet next to my face. It reeked. I sat up, mildly disoriented from the smell and pitch blackness, and reached for my lamp. Yellow light flooded my bedroom and I saw something rolling in the corner opposite of my bed. Left of my dresser, beneath the window, was something I’d never seen. It was no bigger than Shiret and covered in curly hay-colored hairs. I couldn’t tell if it was alive or dead. My heart thundered in my chest. I peaked to see what my cat had dropped onto the bed : it was an eye. The pupil stared up at me ; blood pooling into the grey iris. It reeks, despite it’s obvious freshness. Shiret hopped off of my bed and slowly stalked up to the thing. He sniffed it, once he was close enough, before looking up to signal that the coast was clear. I was too stunned to speak or act. Shiret meowed in annoyance and hoped up on the window sill. \n\n“𝚄 𝚗 𝚕 𝚘 𝚌 𝚔 . . . 𝙸𝚝“\n\nI shivered at the voice in my head. It felt like a purr in my inner ear. Somehow I knew who was speaking to me although I didn’t have a way to rationalize it. I stared into his amber eyes, and he stared right back. I remember feeling something I’d never felt before ; a combination of gratitude, apprehension, and curiosity. My gaze returned to the dead thing on my bedroom floor. I wanted it out. \n\n“𝙷 𝚞 𝚛 𝚛 𝚢  𝙽𝚘𝚠 . . .  \n\nI slowly rose to my feet and shuffled over to the edge of the sill. I didn’t want to take my eyes off of the thing but did so to unlatch the window’s lock. The window and screen opened without much noise. Shiret wasted no time. He leapt down, grabbed the thing by it’s neck, then jumped out of the window. I always knew he was a special cat, however I could not hide my shock any longer. \n\nI screamed. \n\nI don’t remember for how long but eventually my bedroom light was switched on and my mother took me into her arms. My father looked puzzled by the stains on my floor. The last thing I remember were Shiret’s eyes peering into my room from outside. I stared into those amber orbs as my dad hoisted me over his shoulder : my mother still cooing at me. I couldn’t make sense of anything anymore. My vision faded to black: I offered no resistance. \n\n\n“𝚜 𝚑 𝚑 𝚑 . . .“ \n\nI stopped screaming .",

        "text": "I had been unemployed for months when I saw the job offer for a “planner” with no experience required. When I called, they told me to come down that night. The office was in the middle of two crumbling apartment complexes with gang graffiti all over the walls and ripped open bags of trash strewn across the alleys. Other than a few homeless people and hooded figures standing on the corner, the entire area looked deserted.\n\nI entered the cracked stucco building and followed the signs for “Avenzi Planning.” On the second floor I knocked on the door. It opened up with a loud squeal.\n\nOn every wall stood posters for old horror and sci-fi movies, from Alien to Halloween to Predator, Phantasm and Hellraiser. A couple dull incandescent bulbs barely illuminated the room. A large desk with an ancient woman behind it took up the majority of the room. She motioned at the seat across from her and I sat.\n\n“Mr. Bellingham? Jason Bellingham?” she asked me in a soft tone. I nodded. “I am Dorothea Lamb. This will be a quick session. You will be paid per task. First, we need you to fill out some surveys.” I nodded genially at this and she gave me a clipboard filled with papers, directing me back out into the lobby to fill it out. I was expecting the generic “Name, Number, Address” type forms, and that was how it started out. But it quickly became weird.\n\n“Do you believe in God?” one question asked. A checklist ran next to it, “Yes” or “No.” “Do you think Hell is real? Would you ever commit suicide? Do you think demons can possess your soul? Do you wish you were never born?” I stared blankly at the sheet for a minute, wondering if there were candid cameras filming me as part of some joke. \n\nI filled it out honestly and returned the sheet to the woman. She scanned it briefly, then put it in the top drawer of her desk, pulling a key from her pocket and locking the drawer behind it.\n\n“You’re hired,” she said, smiling widely at me. Her beady brown eyes studied me over her huge Cheshire cat grin. “Can you start training immediately?” I nodded, feeling a small tight pit of anxiety in my stomach as her smile never faltered. Her eyes looked like tiny black holes in the overly bright fluorescent lighting of the room. Something felt wrong, but I really needed the money. I hadn’t had a job in months and my savings account was already overdrafted. If I didn’t pay my rent by the end of next week, the landlord said she would begin eviction proceedings immediately.\n\n“Absolutely,” I said, offering her a wan smile. She smacked her meaty hands down on the desk, making me jump.\n\n“Great!” she said, still showing far too many teeth in her disconcerting grin. “Follow me to the training center.” She got up quickly, moving much faster than an obese woman like her would appear to be able, and motioned for me to come.\n\nI followed her down a hallway from her office, the carpet feeling wet and squelchy beneath my sneakers. The fluorescent lights flickered in overly bright strobes, making me feel nauseated and disoriented. Mrs. Lamb seemed totally unaffected by any of it. She walked with a grace unusual for someone who looked like she broke the 300-pound mark.\n\nShe turned suddenly, opening a random door on the right that looked just like the endless lines of doors on both sides of the hall. It had no marking or number on it to differentiate it, but when she opened it, I saw it lead into a garage. Men and women in identical uniforms stood in lines next to vans labeled “Celestial Pathway”. They all had on pure white pants and button-down shirts for the men, or skirts and blouses for the women. Not a single spot or stain marred the cloth on any of them. They all stared at me like mannequins, with identical blank smiling expressions on all of their faces. Goosebumps popped out all over my skin and a thin sheen of sweat began to gather on my forehead as my gut told me to get the hell out of there.\n\nBut I really needed the money, so I ignored it and continued forward.\n\nFrom the corner of the room, a man stepped forward in an extremely expensive black suit from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. It was professionally tailored and had a silky sheen that glimmered under the bright lights overhead. His pale gray eyes stared at me, as cold as iron, his white hair perfectly coiffed, his skin smooth and totally free of wrinkles despite his advanced age. He handed me a business card. I looked down at its embossed words, frowning.\n\n*Karavar Avenzi- Businessman, Entrepreneur, Enlightened Being.* Below that, it had his phone number, fax number and email address.\n\n“Um, hi there,” I said awkwardly, holding out my hand. “My name is Jason Bellingham.” He shook it, his hand radiating warmth, his grip feeling like steel as he crushed my hand under his.\n\n“Karavar Avenzi,” he said simply, giving my hand a single pump before releasing it. “You can call me Karavar, however. I am the owner and operator of this building, as well as many other businesses in the area. Most importantly, however, I operate a spiritual group here, one we call the Celestial Pathway.” He motioned at the vans for emphasis, showing off the professionally-wrapped massive letters that covered all sides of the vehicles.\n\n“First of all,” he said, pulling a clipboard from out of nowhere and handing it over to me, “we just need to finish the formalities. This here is your NDA, which states you will never speak of what you see while working here to anyone. And this is your employment contract- $27 an hour to start, and potentially more later if everything works out for the best.” My mouth dropped at this. Most of the temp and non-degree jobs around here paid anywhere from $13 to $20 an hour. $27 an hour was a life-changing amount for me right now. All the red flags I had noticed in this place were brushed away by my mind as a flood of hope took over.\n\n“Thank you so much,” I said quickly, excited, feeling my heart fluttering in my chest. “You have no idea how much this job means to me.” Karavar smiled politely at me, waiting for me to finish. Then he produced a blindfold from the inner pocket of his jacket.\n\n“Put this on,” he said bluntly. “We must go to the worksite now- or at least, *you* must go to the worksite. I have important things to attend to first.” I held the blindfold in my right hand, like a dead fish limply strewn over my fingers.\n\n“Put it on,” he repeated insistently, his voice turning cold. I did as he commanded, a rising trepidation battling the need for money in my mind. A strong hand tightened around my arm, and I felt the stinging pain of a needle going into my neck. Then I lost consciousness.\n\nI woke up an indeterminate time later, feeling pine needles and twigs underneath my fingers, the smell of evergreens giving a pungent aroma to the air. Mixed in with that sweet pine smell was an undertone of rotting meat, urine and liquified shit. I sat up quickly, thinking that I was blind for a moment before remember the blindfold and ripping it off. What I saw in front of me horrified me.\n\nA few hundred feet away across a grassy field, a pile of nude bodies was stacked in a pyramid, legs and arms hanging out like loose stitches in an unfinished needlework project. The white-clad members of the organization stood next to a couple of the Celestial Pathway vans on the dirt road between me and the pile of corpses. The largest member stepped forward, and I recognized her instantly as Dorothea Lamb.\n\n“Good evening, Mr. Bellingham,” she said sweetly, her beady eyes narrowing as she gazed down at me. “I’m glad to see you returned to the land of the living. The time of your training has come.” The rest of the organization members, which I was now beginning to suspect were actually cult members, stared at me silently, slight identical grins marring their otherwise expressionless faces. A black man with a shaved head stepped stepped forward from the cult members, motioning for me to follow him as he turned and began walking towards the pile of corpses.\n\nHaving no other choice, my eyes downcast as I walked past the expressionless faces, I followed him. Next to the rotting bodies, I saw two things that sent a sense of shock through me: an industrial-sized woodchipper and a black hole in the ground, about five feet across and perfectly level with the grass and dirt around it. As we walked closer, though, I realized that the hole was not a hole in the traditional sense. It shimmered and sent up sparks of iridescent light. The surface of it resembled an oil stain, the blackness mixing with the dying light of the day to form rainbows that shifted and morphed into one another. Behind that blackness, I saw what looked like humanoid shapes swimming and dancing, but as I tried to focus on them, my head began to pound and they seemed to disappear or swim away.\n\n“I don’t recommend you stare too deeply into that portal,” the black man said with a growl. “Sometimes it can hypnotize people, and those it hypnotizes have been known to jump in from time to time. We never see them again.” Tearing my gaze away, I looked up at him.\n\n“What’s your name, friend?” I asked, trying to be as nice as possible, hoping I would still get out of here alive.\n\n“You call me K,” he said, extending his hand. “In our religion, the monks and nuns give up our names. Only the workers like Mrs. Lamb or the leaders like Karavar Avenzi keep theirs.” I shook his hand as he talked, making eye contact. He didn’t smile. His shaved head reflected the light of the sunset as the sun began to disappear behind the trees. “Now listen up, because I am only going to say this once. Your job is to dispose of the traitors-” he pointed to the pile of bodies behind us, “-and to feed the Asuras.” With this, he pointed to the shimmering black hole. “The Asuras don’t like full bodies, so we provide them with assistance.” He pointed to the woodchipper. “Any questions?” I had many, many questions, but I wasn’t going to say that.\n\n“What are the Asuras?” I asked. I thought he would slap me, but instead he simply stared daggers at me before responding.\n\n“They are from the stars,” he said. “They came down from Heaven and they will return to it, bringing us with them. But until that time comes, we need to feed them and keep the organization pure. The Celestial Pathway is literally that- the Pathway to the stars, the way to Heaven for all of us, you included, if you choose to accept what is given. Now get to work.”\n\nI hate to admit it, but I did get to work. K turned on the woodchipper with a roar, and I grabbed the first body and dragged it over. He didn’t want to touch it or help me in anyway; I had the feeling none of the cult members liked to touch the bodies, which is very likely why they hired me in the first place. The body was still fresh, the blue eyes staring blankly up at me, as if asking “Why?” Grunting, I pushed the feet up into the conveyor belt of the woodchipper, then grabbed the shoulders and lifted it. The belt did the rest of the work, carrying the body into the interior machinery. With a wet crushing sound, the body began to disassemble. Pieces of bone and flesh began to roar out into the black shimmering hole. I heard a harmonic song of joy from the hole as the slurry disappeared into it, and the opening seemed to expand outwards as the beings inside fed on the human meat. K indicated for me to continue, so I did.\n\nSome of the bodies were in worse shape than the first, the skin sloughing off in my hands, the bloated flesh releasing rancid-smelling gases that made me gag and cough. There were men and women of all races and ages, and even a few children. Under the baleful gaze of K, with all the other cult members ready to come at a moment’s notice, I knew I had no choice but to continue my task until it was completed. I only hoped they would let me go home.\n\nOnce I got to my seventh body, things started to go wrong. I picked up the fresh-looking body of a young Asian woman, but her eyes flew open. She was covered in blood and gore, but apparently not dead. Her breath began to come in heaving gasps as she looked straight at me, whispering, “Please, help me.” Instinctively, I dropped her like I had accidentally picked up a poisonous snake. I almost started to scream, but at that moment K roughly pushed past me, pulling a syringe from his pocket and shoving it into her neck. Then he indicated that I should continue.\n\n“I can’t continue!” I wailed plaintively. “She’s still alive! What if other ones are still alive too?” \n\n“They are dead to us, so therefore they are dead to the world. We are the path of life. We are the Celestial Path. Now move these bodies made of meat, you maggot.” My head downcast, I did as he said. Grabbing her by the ankles, I began to pull the naked body towards the woodchipper. I didn’t notice any breathing anymore from the woman, and I hoped for her sake she was dead. Out of pity, though, I put her into the conveyor belt headfirst, wondering if any of the others were actually alive when I put the bodies in. I shuddered at the very thought, my stomach turning in quick nauseous flips.\n\nBut I knew that if I refused, they would kill me. I could see it in the eyes of K and all the other cult members. Actually, speaking of the other cult members, what were they all doing here, I wondered to myself. Sneaking a peak in that direction, the dying light of the day illuminated a horrifying scene. \n\nThey were gathered in a circle around a shimmering black being thirty feet tall. Its skin sent off rainbows, as if made of oil spots on the pavement, and it had no features, no eyes, no mouth, no hair, nothing besides the human shape of a black behemoth. I saw the cult members praying on their knees to it, and as they murmured, the being seemed to grow and solidify. The air around it cracked with electricity, throwing off sparks of light in all directions. The longer I stared at it, the more I felt hypnotized, until K came from behind me and smacked me in the back of the head.\n\n“Don’t stare at the Asuras!” he said to me. “You think you are worthy to even look upon it? You aren’t worthy to lick the dirt from its feet.” I nodded silently, then went back to work, dragging more bodies to the woodchipper. The hole continued to grow, until I wondered if it would suck in the woodchipper itself eventually. The circumference of it was only a few feet away by this point, and the hole had grown to over thirty feet across. Looking down into it, I saw the oily black beings beneath the surface were writhing and dancing at an amazingly fast speed, almost too fast for my eye to see anything more than a constant blur.\n\nK came up beside me, looking down into the hole for a second. I pretended to walk back to the pile of bodies, but I kept a close eye on him. He continued to stare down, hypnotized, and I knew this might be my only chance to lose him and escape.\n\nI got a running start from ten feet behind him, trying to sprint as quietly as I could. Despite this, he heard my footsteps and began to turn as I plowed into him at full speed. The half-turn ended up being to my advantage, as his legs tangled as he went flying into the black opening.\n\nHis mouth opened in a silent scream as hundreds of black arms, all covered in that oily sheen of rainbows and colors, flew up and grabbed him. Pulling him in different directions, his body tore into pieces, then sunk beneath the surface.\n\nI took the chance and began to run towards the forest, away from the cult members praying to the black god behind me. As I passed the pile of corpses, I saw some of them stirring, trying to fight their way out from the tangle of arms and legs, rising up from the rotting bodies that surrounded them.\n\nOnce I was in the woods, I just ran randomly, changing directions multiple times. I was caught in pricker bushes and my skin torn, but due to the adrenaline, I barely felt it. Eventually I heard the roaring of traffic and followed it to a highway, where I flagged down a car who called the police.\n\nI told them the entire sordid tale, and they gave me the benefit of the doubt, even allowing me to show them to the original building where I had interviewed. But now it was abandoned, all the posters and desks gone, all the vans missing from the garage. Not a person was in sight.\n\nThey said they’d follow up with me if they found anything, but that was weeks ago and I never heard anything back from them. But I did hear from my old friend- Karavar Avenzi, Businessman, Entrepreneur, Enlightened Being. At least, he sent me a piece of mail.\n\nIt was a check for the hours I had worked. True to his word, he had paid me $27 an hour for the entire time I had disposed of those bodies for them, even including payment for the time taken to interview and travel to the site. And yes, I did deposit the check.\n\nAfter all, I *really* needed the money.",

        "text": " \n\n\tSo as it says in the title, I'm a hairdresser. I work for a pretty fancy place. We do everything, extensions, color, wig cuts, the works. And I'm what they call a tier 1 hairstylist. This means I'm below what my store calls a \"Master\" hairstylist. You'll be happy to know I'm almost there! But that's not why I'm writing today. \n\n\tI, of course, have clients who stick with me and only me. They will even happily reschedule if I'm out sick or on vacation. Most of them are the nicest, with a couple Karens who I'll just smile while they talk about little Jimmy's football game and how the ref made a bad call, so she got him suspended by getting her kid to frame him with weed in his locker (High school ref in a pee-wee game. True story). \n\n\tAgain rambling, sorry. So, anyway, one of these clients I'll call Amber. She's one of my regular clients and only sees me, but to be honest, this girl has some of the oddest requests I've ever seen. There's about a complete change up from hairstyles every almost 3 months when she sees me. I don't even know what her natural hair looks like tbh. One month it's a black pixie, and the next time she sees me, she'll ask for a long blonde french braid. It's ALWAYS a challenge, and tbh I really enjoy it. Every color and every extension gets me one step closer to being a Master stylist and that sweet, sweet pay grade. \n\n\tI would enjoy it even more if it wasn't for the *way* she asks for these styles. The first time was 4 years ago, and I think she asked me along the lines of. \"I want to look like a woman who would rather use her money on box hair dye and drugs than feed her children.\" \n\n\tSo remember that pixie cut? She didn't ask for just a dyed black pixie cut layered in the back like a normal person. She asked, \"I want to look like a 24-year-old goth boy who is a drain on his family and hits his younger sister and mother because he thinks they're just like every other damn whore in the world when in reality he's a drain on society and got brainwashed by Andrew Tate.\" I showed her a picture of a goth boy hairstyle, and she nodded. She told me I was the only one who understood exactly what she was going for. I have never thought about asking why. Usually, I just try to focus on my work because the looks she wants are a drastic change from what I have in front of me. The best part is she always tips well and is very kind, I suppose. \n\n\tThere is one more thing she does. I've never seen her natural hair, but she does have a style. Because every time she gets a crazy style, she comes in 3 days later and asks for her hairstyle. Her hairstyle is just long dyed black hair with bangs. I always have her extensions on the ready and keep them after about the fourth time she came back after a style. I remember asking her if she didn't like the style every time up until the fourth. But she just said. \"No, I loved it. The person I showed it to loved it too.\"\n\n\tSo a weird girl with weird requests. I could get over it. I don't know if anyone reading this is going to believe me. My coworkers recently introduced me to these \"True Crime\" podcasts. Like everyone who dives into them, I've been obsessed. I found a kinda obscure one that is just two guys talking about unsolved murderers. And they were pretty over the top and had some crazy theories, but I saw on their list they had one about our town. I listened to it tonight. Just so you're aware, I live in a rather large town. It's not quite a city, but it would be in any rural area, so a couple of murders weren't too weird, and it's not the best place to live. However, these guys believed that a bunch of murders that had happened in the past couple of years were connected. Even some that had already been technically solved, and someone was prosecuted. \n\n\tAnd then, I did my own research into the murders they talked about. A few people were behind bars for the crimes, but then I saw *them, the victims.* Guys, it was her. Not really her, but every single style I did for her. The victims had the same style. Every single one. And then I looked into every murder in the past years since she started seeing more. I wrote all the names in a notebook. Then I checked my schedule on the app on my phone. I figured it would be after, i prayed it would be after. But no, every single time she booked an appointment with me. It was one or two days before the murder. Every single time. \n\nI looked into the victims more since then; every one of them honestly did horrible things. Assault of various kinda, abuse, everything you can think of. Police barely looked into some of these murders, and you can tell. These are the people that you breathe a sigh of relief when they are gone if you had the displeasure of knowing them. I put the notebook away. I'm not ready to handle this yet. I  don't know if I should go to the police. But I sent one e-mail to the podcast guys. The list of all the names. I don't know why I did it, but I just figured maybe they'll know something. Though i think i would rather them tell me I'm wrong. \n\nShe has an appointment tomorrow. I  can barely think about anything else. I don't know who I'm changing her into tomorrow. I don't know why I don't want to call in sick or quit. Maybe because I know deep inside I'm rooting for her.",

        "text": "Come moon rise, this road turns into a highway for hell’s freakiest and deakiest people. Hulken is not for the faint, fickle or skiddish: it was built for chaos.\n\nI grew up here In Hulken .My parents married in Santa Monica, yet decided to settle in a shit-hole opposite of a craggy coast. My home was built by my father and my uncle in a matter of months; nine to be exact. I was born right on the porch of that shitty shelter. It was never a home.\n\nBy the time I turned 7, my parents had made something of themselves. They opened a shop in the town’s main commercial strip and were doing well. I was a happy child. All my needs were met and then some. My parents smiled and hugged all day while running the shop but slept in separate bedrooms at home. They loved me and reminded me every single day. At some point though, they started forgetting to say it to each other. \n\nAround my 11th birthday my dad adopted a new catchphrase.\n“We’re doing great” \nHis teeth were rotting from the tobacco he chewed, but sure, he’s “doing great.” My mother was happy with working alongside her husband. She became an ideal wife; she was no longer an ideal mother. I could count the number of times she smiled at me annually on one hand. I never got the sibling I asked for, and eventually stopped asking once my father brought home a kitten. It was the smallest thing I’ve ever seen, and the cutest. I named him Shiret, after a comic book character I liked at the time. He was my best friend. Shiret was “mischievous” according to my dad: I disagree\nHe had a habit of getting his paws into the coolest adventures and always made sure I tailed closely behind him. \n\nNot many people in Hulken had pets. They’re a superstitious bunch. Cats especially, seemed to ward of the townsfolk en masse. I never felt the need to be wary of my pet; that was until the day he brought home an ear. It didn’t belong to any wild animal I recognized. It was small, roughly the size of a quail egg, and covered in thin-wiry-gray hairs.  He dropped it onto the back porch step, a few inches away from were I’d been peacefully daydreaming. It didn’t look like he himself had torn it off of the poor creature; rather like he’d found it laying somewhere. It reeked too. There was black matter coagulated on the side I assume was once attached to the thing. It really reeked: in a repulsive and sweet way. \nI couldn’t look at it anymore so I picked Shiret up, kicked it unto the brush and went inside. I didn’t dwell on it for too long and enough time passed for me to forget about it. \n\nThat year, the first major snowfall came in mid November. I walked home with my neighbors that day. When I made it to the back porch I saw Shiret waiting for me outside. He had something white in his mouth. Snow? I remember thinking. As I crouched down I saw something thin and wet draping from the white ball. I realized what it was even before he dropped it proudly by my feet. It was an eye.\nLike the ear, it was decaying in some parts; the iris a grey opaque. Despite the cold, I could still smell the rot. I was upset with him. This was intentional but I couldn’t understand what it meant.\n\nOnce we were both inside of my room I chastised him. I doubt he understood. Instead he wore this drôle expression, as if waiting for me to finish. I made sure to lock the windows that night ti ensure he didn’t get out. I fell asleep with him sitting beside my head. He was licking his paws and I felt a small surge of disgust. I thought back to the parts of that thing he’d returned home with. My thoughts drifted until they lulled to nothingness. \n\nShiret’s paws were kneading my cheek as I groggily opened my eyes. My room was black, despite the moon being visible through my window. I felt someone watching me. Shiret stopped pawing at me and dropped something warm and wet next to my face. It reeked. I sat up, mildly disoriented from the smell and pitch blackness, and reached for my lamp. Yellow light flooded my bedroom and I saw something rolling in the corner opposite of my bed. Left of my dresser, beneath the window, was something I’d never seen. It was no bigger than Shiret and covered in curly hay-colored hairs. I couldn’t tell if it was alive or dead. My heart thundered in my chest. I peaked to see what my cat had dropped onto the bed : it was an eye. The pupil stared up at me ; blood pooling into the grey iris. It reeks, despite it’s obvious freshness. Shiret hopped off of my bed and slowly stalked up to the thing. He sniffed it, once he was close enough, before looking up to signal that the coast was clear. I was too stunned to speak or act. Shiret meowed in annoyance and hoped up on the window sill. \n\n“𝚄 𝚗 𝚕 𝚘 𝚌 𝚔 . . . 𝙸𝚝“\n\nI shivered at the voice in my head. It felt like a purr in my inner ear. Somehow I knew who was speaking to me although I didn’t have a way to rationalize it. I stared into his amber eyes, and he stared right back. I remember feeling something I’d never felt before ; a combination of gratitude, apprehension, and curiosity. My gaze returned to the dead thing on my bedroom floor. I wanted it out. \n\n“𝙷 𝚞 𝚛 𝚛 𝚢  𝙽𝚘𝚠 . . .  \n\nI slowly rose to my feet and shuffled over to the edge of the sill. I didn’t want to take my eyes off of the thing but did so to unlatch the window’s lock. The window and screen opened without much noise. Shiret wasted no time. He leapt down, grabbed the thing by it’s neck, then jumped out of the window. I always knew he was a special cat, however I could not hide my shock any longer. \n\nI screamed. \n\nI don’t remember for how long but eventually my bedroom light was switched on and my mother took me into her arms. My father looked puzzled by the stains on my floor. The last thing I remember were Shiret’s eyes peering into my room from outside. I stared into those amber orbs as my dad hoisted me over his shoulder : my mother still cooing at me. I couldn’t make sense of anything anymore. My vision faded to black: I offered no resistance. \n\n\n“𝚜 𝚑 𝚑 𝚑 . . .“ \n\nI stopped screaming .",

        "text": "This story just took place 24 hours ish ago as I just turned 18) I am living in my own condo and I was just coming back from my party, celebrating me and my friends 18th birthday (yes we were born on the same day). \n\nThe story really starts once I had left the party. I say my goodbyes to my friends (obviously completely worn out and feeling all of the after effects of a party like this). Anyway, I ring an uber to come pick me up from the party. So I enter the Uber and immediately greeted by a man. \n\nNow, thinking back, I should have probably just gotten one of my friends to drop me off as something was amiss as I will share with you. I am greeted by the driver, and, as I would expect, the driver definitely did not want to be there, with his dreary eyes and his stressed look about him. With the time being around two to three in the morning, it made sense for him to be looking like this. We set off, and a little while later, I catch a small glimpse of the man from the rear view mirror. His mood had seemed to have changed. Completely different from the man who picked me up, as his eyes seemed to be fully dilated and facial structured somewhat the same but still energised. \n\nWhat really scared me was his smile. That smile was just plain awful. He looked so misshapen, so tyrannical, all I could do was stare and keep my eyes locked on him. He (although I would consider him to be an ‘it) opens his mouth (while still locking eyes with me) and announces that the destination had been reached. I step out of the Uber and immediately I am greeted with an usual amount of fog and what looks like lights coming out of my house. I navigate through the fog, and enter through the door. \n\r\nAt this point I really should have been on high alert, but in my tired state I brush it off and forget about it. I go and do my usual bits as I do in the evening like teeth brushing, showering etc. As I go do one last check of the house (to see if all the doors are locked and turning off all the lights). As I look outside to see if the fog had cleared, I find that it has. However, my gaze meets the Uber. God I really wish I didn’t. I don’t know if the outcome of this story would be changed, but looking at that smile really sparked a real sense of fear and regret.\n\nThis thing, this smile (not even the man) seemed to be searching and looking for me, wanting something. I back up from the window and I rush to turn on the light of the room, and holy shit. The man, the man was walking to my house. I begin to dial 999, but as quick I turned on the lights, it went away. I ran to the window, and, to my surprise, there was nothing there. I collapse on my bed and let out a huge sigh of relief, thinking I was just hallucinating and drift into sleep. Around 2 hours later id say, while still fast asleep, I feel a sharp scratching sensation in my back. I slowly wake up and this scratching feeling slowly becomes more and more intense, turning into a very intense and fast paced prodding feeling, like a kid annoying their parents to wake up on Christmas day.\n\n As this becomes more and more intense, I feel a sharp, cold breath as if there was someone or something hovering right above me, waiting for me to awaken. I slowly come to my senses (scared shitless) and as I do I feel a sensation of paralysis overcome me. (This will be important later) I then snap out of it and fully wake up, looking around, afraid and panicked. At this point, I don’t think any sane person would want to go back to sleep after what had just happened, so I go downstairs to make some coffee, to energise myself. \n\nPeculiarly, as I wait for the coffee to be made, I realise that I did not turn any of the lights off in my house, which I swore I did (again, this is important as you will find out later). Now here’s where I really should have started to panic. I go back upstairs to find my phone, but I fail to find it. I use the only ancient home phone to ring it, to locate it, however, to my surprise, it picks up. Shocked, I decide to listen.\n\n After a few seconds of a somewhat loud silence, I hear some shuffling and silence. I put the phone down and ring again. This time it actually rings, and I locate the source. The kitchen. The same kitchen where I had been making coffee. The same kitchen I had been standing clueless in. I let out an audible gasp, recollect my thoughts and just dash for the kitchen and grab my phone. A note. A scrunched, somewhat charred and barely readable note. I reach out to pick it up and read it. I can’t really summarise, or still believe, the note, so I will just repeat what it said (this note will be engraved in my memory forever).\r\n \r\n \r\nHey! So I bet there’s been some weird shit going on within the past 24 hours of your life. I would say don’t worry, but now is a time to be on high alert and collected. I will explain everything in due course. FIRST STEP. I should have mentioned this before, but DO NOT LOOK AWAY. Do not react to sudden movements in your vision, do not look away. This note is the thing keeping you alive. Please trust me. We are your only hope. Try not to blink or close your eyes. It’s not worth it believe me.\n\n Ok. Now that the most important step is out of the way, listen. So, allow me to explain. We are a group, kind of like the ghostbusters, but with real life shit. Now, you being 18 plays a very important role. When you turn 18, from what we know, each and every one of them is implanted with a serum of sorts. \n\nWe still don’t fully know why, or what for that matter, this serum is consisted of. All we know is that there are creatures, things from other planets who wants this serum. All these activities begun to pop up on our radar just a few weeks back, meaning these things are after something, and they want it bad. Only now, within the past week or so, they seemed to have become more developed and able, which is terrifying. All of this may be very hard to believe, but please stay with me, for the safety of us both. Anyway, recently, they have somehow gotten a hold of this serum, and that’s bad news. In your case, you have gotten severely unlucky and lucky at the same time.\n\n Unluckily, they have seemed to have developed a new technology which mimics a mist (what we know as fog) and it can be sprayed and precisely used on certain areas, the front of your house for instance. From what we know, this fog has abilities which include a form of mind control, misdirection, and can enter the human body. For you, you have been somewhat lucky, as only the last 2 have affected you. Now here’s the real kicker. You know that serum? Well, they seemed to be able to precisely locate the serums’ location before it enters your body, as if they were able to track it like a heat signature of sorts.\n\n In your case, the serum was probably as a gas and in the air somewhere, ready to enter your body. However, the fog combatted this, and kind of blocked it from getting anywhere near you. The house you’re staying in? Yeah, it’s not yours.\n\n As I mentioned, the misdirection has seemed to have worked, as you are only staying in a mimic of your own house, this is not your home. DO NOT PANIC NOW, you are doing great. So, we know that the penetration and misdirection part has worked, which may not be the best for you. Right now, you could be experiencing some hallucinations, keep your eyes on the page. This is especially important now, as they may know you are aware of them, and begin to act faster. Keep cool. The rest of the things you experienced, such as the man in the car, I will do my best to explain. Your driver, he was a normal uber driver. These creatures however, they are much smarter than us.\n\n You familiar with skinwalkers? Well, the same kinda concept applies here. Through some sci-fi bullshit, they gained control of the drivers mind, and took you to your destination, but kept an eye on you, which is when you saw that thing searching for you. Right now, it is entirely possible that they are watching over you, but we just don’t know. For the past weeks, we have been able to keep these situations under control and stopped the serum from escaping the reaches of those things, but they are growing more intelligent and smarter each day, and this situation has become the worst it has, unluckily for you. \n\nFrom our data, there is still hope for you, as they have not been able to obtain the serum yet. As this has never happened before, we have no idea what happens if you don’t receive that serum, as the last girl that was to receive it and didn’t? Completely flew off our radar.\n\n Maybe making you aware of the serum could be putting you in danger, however its best to take risks at times. We believe that the lights in your house act as small homes for these creatures, so DO NOT TURN THEM OFF. Do not release them. Turning off the lights may startle them and cause them to become aggressive. This brings me onto step 2. Anything that seems out of the ordinary, such as the lights, do not change them. That painting in the hallway? If it seems off, let it be. Do not disturb them. Very simple, and I’m sure you are very capable of following this. \n\nStep 3. You got lucky, the sleep paralysis did not seem to fully set in, however do NOT go back to sleep. No matter what. All of this random shit that you are seeing, feeling and experiencing is all a part of their way to gain entry, to break down the kind of mental fortress that you have, in simple terms. So that sleep paralysis wasn’t really sleep paralysis, it was kind of a provocation in order for you to begin to panic.\n\n Going back to sleep would have possibly allowed them to stay around, if you know what I mean. Don’t give in, just like you have been, so good job. Step 4 don’t leave your house either. I can’t really explain but walking back out there probably will cause more misdirection and possibly allow the fog to fully gain access to you. Stay away from things like reflections. Not for the reason that they will jump out of the mirror or shit like that, but you may see things you will never unsee. OK now you know for the most part what to do. Let me explain the next 48 hours of your life to you. Although we are watching, we cannot interfere, if that makes you feel any better. Now listen very carefully. After finishing reading this note, turn around, and head to the fridge. DO NOT DO THIS NOW. Take any foodstuffs out of it and eat it. \n\nGo on your phone, with volume as to not arouse their suspicions as to why there is no sound. They are extremely smart. We can watch but cannot interfere. If you are beginning to drift to sleep, please don’t. If you find this does happen however, turn on your TV and go to a channel you haven’t seen before. We can watch but cannot interfere. We can watch but cannot interfere. WE CAN WATCH BUT CANNOT INTEFERE.\n \r\nAnd that was the end of the note, a long one I know. After this, I knew I that this was my only hope and I just decided to go with it. I sat down, taking it all in. As my eyes graced each word, I was in a complete state of panic and tremor. The worst part about it all. The worst part was that the part after the creepy cryptic kind of message at the end, was that it was completely ripped off. So, I was completely in the dark. I figured my best bet was to simply follow the instructions and do my best to survive. To this day, I still have no idea if this was sick and twisted practical joke, but what kind of practical joke would be able to pull off all these abnormal events? Anyway, I go to grab some food from the fridge and sit down. \n\r\nAh fuck. About an hour later I jerk my head up from the crusty pizza from a week ago, and that’s when I see it. \r\n“HOW DID YOU GET IN MY HOUSE?” I scream in dread, knowing this could possibly be it. It just stands there, fucking stands there with fully blacked eyes and that dreaded smile. It lets out a low pitched, intimidating laugh, and reaches its hand out to me, like some Michael Myers shit. \n\r\n“I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT LEAVE ME ALONE!” At this point, I realise what I did. I fell asleep. The final thing the note said not to do. I begin to feel my throat clench up and I dash for the TV, the thing it said to do but didn’t explain. What did it mean?? ‘We can watch but cannot interfere’ It kept repeating that. Over and over. Maybe it was a secret message? Or the person who wrote me the note was just going crazy, just how I was starting to feel; both petrified and frozen in fear. I snap out of it and continue to dash for the TV. I scramble the remote, feeling the same icy cold breath as I felt before coating my neck. I dash to the side, turning the TV on. I switch to a random channel and wait. Nothing. \r\n“Ah fu-” I let out as I turn around and see nothing but darkness. \n\r\n“Please leave me be, I don’t know what you want”, I was just completely defeated at this point. I knew what was coming. I just didn’t know if I was accepting it. The paintings on the walls began to spin, as my head did. If the so called ‘ghostbusters’ couldn’t stop them, what the fuck could I do? I knew I couldn’t go outside; the note told me all about the fog. \n\r\nThen the fog. The fog made its return.\n \r\n“Fuck” I exclaimed.\n\r\nMy only way out was the front door. I dashed for the door and just ran. I ran till I found the next town, and here I am. Telling you this story. I am uploading this with some internet I found at a random café, and I hope this uploads in time. For everyone almost turning 18, stay safe. I will try to keep you updated and posted on the situation.",

        "text": "it was a day like any other, my alarm went off at 6:00 am to get up and ready for school. the sun rose at 6:37 am and the dog started barking at 7:00 am to be let out. I checked to see if dad woke up in time to take me to school, but his light was still off and he was fast asleep. I decided not to wake him as I did not want to deal with him angry later. I knew then that I would have to walk to school and back home that day. I got dressed and headed out at 7:20 after letting the dog out to potty. It's about a twenty minute walk from my house to the school giving me about 10 minutes before school to talk with my friends. \n\nI get to the school about 7:40 am and wait outside for my friends. It's September and the weather is gorgeous so no need to wait inside. I see my friend Sarah coming closer, but she looks off, something isn't right. I ask her if everything is alright and she tells me \" yeah, just had a really long night\" then asked if she could stay with me tonight. I told her I'd ask my dad and let her know. School went on just fine throughout the day, first art, then science, then history finally my lunch period came and that's when I texted my dad at 11:50 asking if Sarah could come over. he replied with \"if it's okay with her parents that's fine, sorry I didn't get up in time to take you to school, do you need a ride home? we could go on a drive after school, it's so nice out!\". I told him no, me and Sarah could walk back home. I told Sarah at next period math that my dad said yes and her face lit up. I'm happy to see that she is happy now. \n\nFast forward to the end of the day we meet at the front of the building to start our walk home together. we're walking down Howard St. when we notice a small child maybe 10-11 all alone in the middle of the street. Me and Sarah approached the kid and as we got closer we noticed that their hair was noted, clothes dirty and torn, and the child was so frightened. We knelt down to the child's height and tried to ask them if they were okay. The child looked up at us, eyes sunken in, and told us her name was Polly. We told her that we were going to hold her hands as we bring her to the sidewalk where it's safe and she nodded her head. Once to the sidewalk we sat down and talked to her. \"Where did you come from?\" Sarah asked. \"I- i- i- I don't know. I snuck out of a window and found myself wondering in the street\". \"oh you poor thing!\" I said, \" we must contact the authorities!\". I started to get up and held my hand out and said \"come with me to my house and we'll get this figured out Polly\". She took my hand and Sarah took her other and we started walking down the street. \n\nAs we got closer to my house I could feel Polly squeezing my hand harder and harder, \"what's wrong Polly?\" I asked. She looked up at me and told me \"I feel like where I came from is somewhere around here\". My stomach dropped and I felt so bad for the small kid. Someone must have held her captive or something. We got to my house and she stopped dead in her tracks. She looked at me and said \"y-yo-you li-live here?\". \"uh yeah I do. it's me and my dad, my mom died a few years ago and my sister moved out for college.\" She held my hand as we walked in the door. Polly, Sarah, and I walked in together holding hands. my dad was in the living room watching TV, drinking his beer like always. \"Hey dad!\" I say and he turns around, his face dropping, \"uh hey uh who is that?\" he said nervously. \"Her name is Polly we found her wondering in the street\" I look at Polly and see her terrified, shaking. From the look on her face I knew my dad had been the one who had her. I tried to rush her out of the house but my dad got to the door first. He started yelling at me to go upstairs with Sarah but there was no way I was leaving Polly now. I had wondered how long she had been here, and I never knew.. I felt guilty and my gut wrenched. I knew I had to get her out. Sarah started screaming and my dad hit her in the back of the head with a lamp base and she fell to the ground. I picked up Polly and ran to the kitchen back door, but my dad ran after me, he's faster and stronger than me. He was able to get to the door and block it off, I grabbed a kitchen knife. He told me I wouldn't do anything with it and I told him \"watch me\". He got near to me trying to grab the girl from my arm but I swung at his face, scraping his cheek. I ran and set the girl down by the stairs as he held his face. I ran back to the kitchen and stabbed him in the heart. as he screamed in pain I went back, grabbed Polly, who was crying, and ran out of the house. I ran to the neighbors and called the cops. turns out she had started escaping about 7:20 when I left and finally got out at 11:50 when my dad texted me. he wanted to use me as an excuse to look for her saying we were going to go on a drive after school. bye dad. \n\nfast forward 3 years later...\nPolly's family found her and let me stay with them as well since my father died (or so I thought). I love my new life so much. Polly's parents treat me so much better and care so much about us. they never let us walk anywhere unless it's with a big group of people which is understandable, but also means I never have to walk in the rain again :). Polly is doing so so well and I'm so glad to have been able to save her from whatever hell my dad would have put her through. \n\nstay tuned for pt. 2",

        "text": "Imagine you open your door and in front of it stands a person who apparently knows everything about you.\n\nThe guy looked just as smug as I imagine a door salesperson. Honestly, I didn't know that they even existed anymore. I mean it does feel slightly intrusive and somewhat old-fashioned, especially as this particular guy didn't stop ringing until I finally opened the door.\n\n\"Good day, sir. How is your morning going?\"\n\nHe was remarkably tall but with great posture. He had to look down at me as he was speaking. \n\n\"Uhm good, thanks-,\"\n\n\"Well good to hear that, so you don't have any problems with parasites yet, huh?\"\n\nI gave him a confused look.\n\n\"Oh, I am sorry. You must not know. Did your parents not tell you? I believed they would have told you before heading off to Spain. Oh, what a luxury to take a vacation in January.\" \n\nI was standing at the door, with one foot outside to make sure he didn't decide to come inside. I had two more meetings and was in no mood to listen to some sales pitch.\n\n\"I'm sorry my parents didn't say anything about.. parasites. Did you have an appointment?\" \n\nI didn't even question why he immediately assumed that I was their son. But he was spot on, my parents did ask me to watch the house seeing that I work remotely anyway. \n\nThe man chuckled.\n\n\"Oh, I'm awfully sorry. I have started the conversation in all the weirdest ways. I didn't even introduce myself, how silly! My name is Jonathan Musterman and I work with ParasiteCorps. Many neighbors have had recent problems in their houses you see-,\"\n\n\"Oh, you're from pest control?\" I raised an eyebrow. He was definitely not dressed like someone who wanted to kill some insects.\n\nHe shook his head vigorously.\n\n\"No, no. *I* don't want to kill anything in there. I'm simply here to drop off a sample and if you look like it you can give me a call. Easy peasy. See, if *they* find their way inside. I know you think I'm trying to sell you something you don't need but you are simply wrong, Owen.\"\n\nOf course, he already knew my name as well.  \n\nI opened my mouth but he cut me off. \n\n\"Alright, I don't want to bug you any longer. I imagine you don't want your colleagues to wait too long.\"\n\n\"What-\"\n\nHe started rummaging through his suitcase and pulled out a black envelope. \n\n\"It's pretty much self-explanatory,\" Jonathan smiled. \"Say hello to your parents when you talk to them.\" \n\nIt was a completely odd way to start my morning but I was just glad that he was gone. \n\n\\--\n\nIn the afternoon the door rang again and I was already dreading who would be behind it. I thought Jonathan was back already to ask what I thought of his sample which I hadn't even opened. \n\nSo I was very positively surprised to open the door to a familiar face instead.\n\n\"Mila!\" \n\n\"Hey, Owen!\" She smiled and gave me a big hug. Mila was the daughter of our next-door neighbors and we'd been close friends growing up. \n\n\"My mum told me you're here. I meant to come by sooner but had some work to do. Can I come in?\" \n\n\"Yeah, of course! I was just about to close my laptop for the day.\"\n\nWe walked straight to the living room and sat down on the couch.\n\n\"I didn't even know you were in town. How long are you staying?\" I asked her. Mila moved away right after high school so we only see each other occasionally when we're both home during holidays. \n\nShe frowned.\n\n\"Yeah but I'm leaving again tonight. Actually, I have to leave really early tomorrow morning buuut I might be back in a few days. So you won't have to die of boredom.\"\n\nI have to admit I was a bit disappointed. There weren't many people in town that I was still in contact with. \n\n\"Well, I'm not *all* alone. Today I got a really interesting visitor,\" I grinned. \"A guy from ParasiteCorps.\" \n\nI proceeded to tell her about my weird encounter with Jonathan and to be honest I hadn't realized how absurd it truly was until I'd said it all out loud. \n\n\"Shit, that guy bugs us all the time too!\" She called out. \"He's so creepy, always tries to find a way inside and I've never seen a truck or any other people from his strange firm. Did he give you anything?\"\n\n\"Uhm, yeah some sample but I don't even know what it is.\"\n\n\"Throw it away!\" \n\nHer gaze was all serious now and her voice stern though I believe I heard some fear in it.\n\n\"I can't explain it but something about him is really wrong. Whatever he gave you, it's probably not good. He'll use it as a reason to come into the house and you won't be able to get rid of him.\"\n\nI swallowed. It's not like I'm a little kid anymore but I suddenly felt very weird about being all alone in this house. \n\n\"Yeah, okay I'll throw it out. To be honest, I wasn't really planning on entertaining him again- but do you think he's dangerous or something?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"I don't know. It's more of a feeling but better safe than sorry, right?\"\n\n\\--\n\nMila ordered pizza and we watched a movie until I almost fell asleep. It was great seeing her again and catching up especially as my days usually looked the same at the house. \n\nSame breakfast, same workplace, same grocery store, the exact same routine.\n\nSo it was quite easy to notice the irregularities.\n\nFor starters, I forgot a whole day of work. \n\nI woke up, logged into my laptop, and made breakfast which I had in front of the television where I stayed until I got hungry again. I randomly found some documentaries on YouTube and somehow kept switching to more and more of them. With my lunch on my lap, I continued the same until it got dark. \n\nI was really lucky that nobody in my team had tried to contact me that day because I wouldn't have been able to explain what had happened. My brain went on autopilot as if it was a lazy Sunday. \n\nAnd the weirdest part is that I couldn't even say what I'd been watching all day. \n\nWhen night came I got so freaked by what had happened that I turned off both my laptop and tv and went for a run to clear my head. \n\nNothing like this had ever happened to me and I had a feeling it was connected to Jonathan.\n\nLater that evening I decided to call my parents and ask them about him.\n\nNeither of them had ever heard of a Jonathan and they both swear nobody like him ever rang their door.\n\n\\--\n\nForgetting work was unfortunate but not necessarily dangerous yet. But then other things started happening. I woke up in the morning and noticed that the stove had been on and the entire kitchen felt like hell even though I hadn't used the stove in two days.\n\nI noticed in the middle of the night when I went to get a glass of water. \n\nCompletely freaked out, I turned it off, happy that I hadn't set anything on fire but still completely out of my mind.\n\nI went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face and that's when I completely lost control. \n\nI looked into the mirror at my face that somehow didn't feel like it really belonged to me anymore. You know how you don't quite feel like yourself when you stare for long enough? \n\nIt was almost like that but a lot worse because before I could move away from the mirror, the left side of my face started twitching.\n\nThe corner of my mouth slowly moved up and it was as if a part of me was trying to smile. I tried to push it back but then my left index finger pulled the corner of my mouth even higher. \n\nI wish I would have called someone then. Maybe it was all mental, stress and being alone for too long was messing with my mind. Unfortunately, instead of seeking help in those situations we often hide even more, afraid of the reaction we might get from others. \n\nI can't say if that was really my thought process, all I know is that I finally pulled away from the mirror and went to sleep. \n\nI should have asked for help.\n\n\\--\n\nI'm incredibly stubborn and I truly used to believe that I was in charge of my actions. But slowly the other thing was taking over. The thing that smiled at me in the mirror.\n\nI wanted to believe that it was someone else who was doing this to me but then I found all the footage. Generally speaking, I'm most suspicious of the way our phones collect data on everything we do but then I remembered how handy it can be. \n\nBecause as it turns out the other me had been using my phone.\n\nFirst I checked my YouTube history. Apparently, all the documentaries I watched were on worms but I don't remember seeing a single one of them. \n\nI knew I needed to go to a therapist or maybe even the hospital. Losing massive chunks of memory like that wasn't normal.\n\nBut that was before I checked my gallery.\n\nThere were two new videos that I don't remember recording. \n\nThe first one started in the garden. The flash of the phone was shining on the ground with three holes as big as footballs. \n\n\"We don't need them now but we'll hide them here until we get hungry,\" \n\nA voice spoke. \n\n*My* voice. \n\nOf course, it didn't sound the way I hear it in my head but I'd heard recordings of me before.\n\nThen my hand came into the frame and it threw small creatures into each hole. \n\nSquirrels, I believe. And they definitely looked dead.\n\nMy stomach started turning at the sight and my heart started racing. This didn't seem like I was simply sleepwalking. It felt like a different personality took over me.\n\nWith my phone still in hand, I ran to the garden where I found three small heaps of earth.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to look into them but I noticed that there was a fourth hole, slightly bigger but it almost appeared unfinished. Maybe because of the shovel next to it.\n\nIt took me a lot of willpower to check the second video. \n\nThis one was only a few seconds short.\n\nI had to rewatch it a few times until I finally understood what I was looking at. \n\nIt was a recording of a baby sleeping in a crib. Then the camera turned around and I saw my own face with eyes wide open and a massive grin.\n\nIt was the child of our neighbors from across the street. At least that's what I think because I've seen them walk around with a stroller.\n\n\"Nothing happened. I would have heard. There would have been police,\" I whispered to myself, my breath getting faster and faster.\n\nWith a shaking hand, I started typing the number of the police. If I really did these things but couldn't remember, I needed to be locked up. Before anything happened to that child. \n\nBut while I was ready to call, I simply couldn't. I'm not sure if it was fear of what would happen or if the other part of me was stopping me. \n\nThen my gaze caught something on the ground.\n\nA black envelope. \n\nAfter Mila had freaked me out about Jonathan I didn't want it to be inside anymore, even in the trash so I threw it out in the garden.\n\nI ignored every voice I heard in my head, picked up that envelope, and ripped it open.\n\nA round pill fell outside and a white postcard with this written on it:\n\n***Did you have a friendly visitor inside your house lately? Maybe a family member, a handyman or possibly an old friend? And now think: do you really remember them? If not, give us a call before it's too late. And before they catch on :)***\n\nOn the other side was a phone number.\n\nMy visitor was Jonathan but as far as I know, he never came inside. \n\nAnd then it hit me.\n\nI ran inside, through the front door outside, and right to our neighbors.\n\nYou might have guessed it by now but they were really worried about me when I asked about their daughter Mila who didn't exist.\n\n\\--\n\n*Before they catch on*.\n\nI had two options. Fight my thoughts and go to the police but that would mean that I'd be arrested and probably sent to a mental institution. Or call the number but it was very well possible that Jonathan did all this to me, that he sent *Mila*. \n\n\\--\n\n\"Oh boy, oh boy. They got you so quickly. You should have opened the sample when I gave it to you. You know I can assist but I can't do *everything* for you.\"\n\nThere he was, the smug salesman back at my door. But this time because I invited him which I realize sounds incredibly stupid but I had a feeling that this was what I needed to do. Mainly because my gut was telling me not to and because I don't believe my gut belongs to me at the moment.\n\n\"This is insane. What the fuck did you do to me?\" I shouted, not caring if any neighbors could hear me.\n\n\"Owen, I didn't do anything. I told you there is a parasite infection going around. I'm here to kill them, this really has nothing to do with you. Gosh, you people can be so self-involved.\"\n\n\"Right asshole, so how do you know everything about me and my parents if you haven't been targeting us?\"\n\nI was so furious I wanted to punch this guy in the face but I knew I'd regret that.\n\nJonathan smiled.\n\n\"I have to know everything so I will notice irregularities. Now you called me for help, do you want it or do you want to wait until you start getting a craving for human flesh?\"\n\nMy head started turning.\n\n\"Why would I trust you? This didn't happen until you came here.\"\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"I came because you were new here. Easy target for them. I really am trying my best to be trustworthy. Although if I am honest I do not care about you, I just want the thing out. But you people always think you're in control, you can't even imagine something else taking over.\"\n\n\"Are you human?\"\n\nHe burst out into laughter.\n\n\"How odd, nobody has asked before. Human, not human, does it matter? Now let's not waste any more time. It will get more power and then I might become your next meal,\" he took a deep breath. \"Now do you have the pill that was in the envelope?\"\n\nJonathan pushed me aside and came into the house, closing the door behind him.\n\nThat's when I knew I'd made a huge mistake. I should have run to the police instead. \n\nHe grabbed my arms with incredible strength and pulled me toward the kitchen. He held my right arm with one hand and pulled something out of his pocket with his other.\n\nA small rope. \n\nHe used it to tie my arm to a cupboard. \n\n\"You're gonna regret this,\" I shouted. \"I will destroy you. I will shred you into pieces!\" My voice was deep and full of hate.\n\n\"Shhh, quiet now. This will be over soon.\"\n\nHe went through his pocket again and this time he pulled out a pill.\n\n\"You're lucky I always bring extra.\"\n\nThen he grabbed my face and shoved it down my throat.\n\nI pulled and pushed, feeling rage like I'd never had before. Finally, I freed myself and pushed against Jonathan with all the strength I had, I was ready to kill him for what he had done to me.\n\nBut suddenly I felt a sharp pain going through my entire body. It started in my head, a feeling as if it would explode any second, and then it went to my stomach. I fell onto my knees, taking short, quick breaths. \n\nAnd then I felt it, slowly moving up my throat. I had to stop the urge to swallow because I knew whatever that was it needed to come out. Except, I still can't believe what I saw crawling out of my mouth. A slimy, black worm the size of my thumb. \n\nJonathan saw it right away, grabbed it, and pulled it out of me.\n\nHe poured some liquid over it that smelled like petrol, threw it into the sink, and then set it on fire. \n\nA smell so foul that it shouldn't exist filled the room until the vile creature disappeared and my mind started recovering.\n\n\\--\n\nI don't know how long I sat on the ground. When you go through something unbelievable your head needs time to catch up. \n\nI almost forgot that he was there until the tall man came down to the ground and handed me a glass of water.\n\n\"Clear again?\"\n\nI couldn't answer.\n\n\"You don't need to believe me but I really didn't do this. I mean I'm not doing this out of the goodness of my heart either. I was hired to kill them.\"\n\nFinally, my voice came back to me.\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"Oh boy, you don't wanna know. This creatures are connected to a lot of other shit going on in the world.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to talk about it. Trust me, there are things happening at the moment that you don't even want to think about. You live in one of the *least* messed up towns. I mean, have you ever heard of Tattletoe, Agsbury, or Marden? [Those places are fucked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/).\"",

        "text": "[VERIFICATION REQUIRED]\n\nEnter Credentials: T.LEON\n\nEnter Password: ************\n\n \n\n[ACCESS GRANTED]\n\nOpening EWI\\MR\\Triton9\\8232022\n\n\n     The Blackhawk helicopter touched down on a small clearing just south of an overpass bridge. The organization that employs my team and me had the surrounding area evacuated hours prior, due to an apparent \"hazardous waste spill.\" It's almost always that. While there would, hopefully, be no civilian interference, I always get worked up about taking my first step away from the safety of the helicopter. Most of my squad carry combat rifles modified to fire .308 rounds, which will stop any person that needs to be dealt with. But we don't deal with normal people, or even people for that matter. If my team is sent in to eliminate a threat, chances are that threat needs to be hit with something much harder. Soon enough, we'd most likely have our work cut out for us with demonic forces. That's our specialty.\n\n\n     I swept my barrel across every nook and cranny I could see, as my flashlight illuminated the concrete structures. My squad mate, a young woman from Morocco named Yara Hakim, performed the same action to my right. After a few moments, she turned to me and nodded her head, signalling the all clear. I talked into my radio, telling my CO that the area was secure. A large man hopped out of the helicopter, followed by three others. They all wore the same thing as me and Yara, tan and grey uniforms with large black suits of exo-armor and a full face helmet. \n\n\n     \"Scorpius, this is Triton-9,\" the large man from the helicopter said into his radio. \"We have arrived at the incident site. Proceeding down.\"\n\n\n     A woman replied over the radio, enabling the entire squad to hear. \"Affirmative, Commander Jorgensen. Supernatural forces reported one kilometer from your position. Your technician has the map of the tunnel system already, proceed with caution.\"\n\n\n     \"Copy,\" Jorgensen responded in a thick Danish accent. \"Over and out.\"\n\n\n     The Blackhawk began to lift off and fly away as we made our way over to a large metal hatch close to a support pillar. We all surrounded it, as Jorgensen gave his orders. \n\n\n     \"Kenju, Hakim, on the cover. Santos and Flaherty, be ready for descent. Leon, be ready for suppressing fire.\"\n\n\n     Like clockwork, we all took our positions. Hakim and Kenju scanned the landing area and surrounding concrete structures for any sign of trouble. Santos, Flaherty and I aimed our barrels toward the hatch, ready to send anything that moved the wrong way back to hell. The Commander grabbed hold of the hatch with his massive armored hand and lifted it up. The sheer force he used to open it almost ripped the hatch from its fixture. Jorgensen backed away so nothing could catch him off guard without his rifle, while Flaherty, Santos and I peered down with our weapons drawn. The flashlights mounted on our rifles shone down into the tunnel, lighting up all sorts of grime and filth, but nothing that posed a threat. \n\n\n     Jorgensen pointed at Santos, then Flaherty, and motioned down toward the ladder that had been illuminated by our lights. Santos nodded, then slung his rifle on his back. He took hold of the first rung and swung his legs over to begin descending. Jorgensen and I aimed down at the sides of Santos, while Lieutenant Flaherty prepared to follow him. Santos reached the bottom of the ladder and spun around, taking his rifle off of his back. He aimed it down the tunnel, from which our vision was obscured. After a moment, he raised his hand and wagged his fingers, signalling he had Flaherty covered.\n\n\n     Flaherty began descending the ladder, and as she did, Jorgensen motioned for Hakim and Kenju. They trotted over to our position, while Jorgensen and I scanned our surroundings. I heard the lieutenant call over the radio that she had made it down, and she and Santos had the base of the ladder covered. Commander Jorgensen told Kenju and Hakim to climb down, as we covered them. Once the two of them had made it down, I began my way down. It was pretty dark, the only thing I could see were the lights from the others bouncing off the walls below. Once I heard the clanking of my large metal boots hit the concrete landing, I took hold of my rifle and prepared to cover Jorgensen as he came down. \n\n\n     Soon enough, everyone had formed up in the subterranean tunnel, and we began moving to the target area. Jorgensen had left Santos to protect the entrance, and as we embarked, he started to set up a couple small sentry turrets. Hakim had let her weapon rest on her back and pulled out her sidearm, a Desert Eagle. She also had her small phone-sized computer in her hand, with a diagram of the tunnel system. Our objective was to make our way to a tent city underground that had apparently been overrun by a small army of demons. Usually, demon attacks are pretty routine. While there are a shit-ton this time, from what our intelligence network had gathered, they were just simple demons. \n\n\n     Yara told us we had about one hundred meters to go until the entrance to the underground clearing that housed the homeless encampment. I prepared myself for the horrors that were about to come. While my team had dealt with plenty of hellspawn, the average person has no clue what to do. Even if they did, they most likely didn't have a heavy-hitting rifle loaded with rounds blessed by priests, shamans or imams. The tricky thing about demons is their hide is thicker than an elephant's, and even if you pierce their skin, they will probably just walk it off if a holy bullet doesn't banish their mortal vessel back to whichever hell they came from. Long story short, they are a pain in the ass to deal with. \n\n\n     We approached the entrance to the large room, and a faint orange glow filled my vision. Faint screams could be heard over the crackle of flames and miscellaneous banging of metal. Hakim approached the door with Jorgensen at her back, as Flaherty, Kenju and I moved across to the other side of the makeshift door. Jorgensen tapped Hakim on her shoulder, indicating he wanted to sneak past her and get a look inside. Jorgensen poked his head through the door, and Flaherty did the same on the other side.\n\n\n     \"Oh shit,\" Jorgensen muttered. That couldn't mean anything good. \"Well, it's demons alright.\"\n\n\n     \"Yeah,\" Flaherty replied. Her head scanned the room from side to side, before abruptly snapping back to where she was looking a few moments ago. \"Is that what I think it is?!\"\n\n\n     I could almost always understand Flaherty well enough, but when she was angry, her Irish accent would become flustered and a little incoherent. She backed up, shaking her head in the process. I looked over at Kenju, and we both took a look for ourselves, trying to see what all the fuss was about. After a moment of looking around, my eyes found what Lieutenant Flaherty was so upset about. Close to the back wall of the clearing, sitting atop a pile of garbage, was the demon Telacor. For a bit of context, Telacor was a nuisance and a half. He was something like the Forrest Gump of demons, if there was some demonic incursion to our realm, chances are this mother fucker was there for it. \n\n     \n\n     Just then, before we could strategize, a small demon came toward the entrance, dragging a homeless man by his legs. The demon cackled to itself, apparently proud of the flaying work it had performed on the man earlier. It dropped the man's legs and brushed its hand off before turning to see Jorgensen. The wretch barely gasped before Jorgensen grabbed the damn thing by its throat and squeezed. The demon's eyes bulged out of its skull as our commander punched it in the face, sending it flying back into the rubble behind us. I lined up a shot, but the little bastard was too quick. It scampered off into the room, screaming its head off. \n\n\n     Every demon in the room looked over to see the five of us standing there. Their leader, that shit-for-brains Telacor pointed at us and hissed some foul incantation. All of his minions stopped torturing the people that remained alive and started barreling toward us.\n\n\n     \"Open fire!\" Jorgensen hollered. \"Take out as many as you can.\"\n\n\n     We began firing at any demon that came near. Most of them went down after a few bullets, but some were more resistant. Kenju blasted the bigger ones with his marksman rifle as the rest of us fired on the nearest demon. I almost shot a woman who came running out of the room. She had what looked like nails sticking out of her skin, covering her body.\n\n\n     \"Ma'am, get down!\" Flaherty shouted. \"Make your way over here!\"\n\n\n     The woman half crawled, half scuttled over toward Flaherty, who in turn pushed the homeless woman behind her. The lady ducked into a corner away from the chaos and covered her ears as the ringing of an absurd amount of bullets flying through the air made my ears begin to hurt, even through the armored helmet. I turned my head to face our flank, as a booming sound had begun to bear down on us from the dark hall. I swung my light, and consequently my rifle, down in the direction of the noise to see another horde of the hellish beasts barreling down on the six of us. \n\n\n     \"Commander!\" I shouted. \"We have incoming bogeys!\"\n\n\n     The team leader whipped his head over to where I had alerted him. He swore into his mic, and motioned for us to begin pulling back. \n\n\n     \"Retreat to the entrance!\" Jorgensen shouted over his radio. \"Santos! Do you copy?\"\n\n\n     \"Yes, boss,\" Santos answered. \"Are you guys clear?\"\n\n \n\n     \"Does it sound like we're clear?! What's your status?\"\n\n\n     \"I'm set, Commander. Not a sound from anything other than some rats.\"\n\n\n     \"Okay, we are wrapping up here, call in for exfil!\"\n\n\n     Santos confirmed the order, as we kept firing on the hordes bearing down on us. We were cleaning the beasts up nicely, but they kept coming. A massive pile of ash was accumulating from where the demon's violently exploded as their souls were sent back to Hell. Jorgenson switched between shooting the wretched beasts and pummeling them with his fists, while the rest of us rapidly fired holy bullets into any demon that dared near our position. We ran back to rendezvous with Santos, taking turns laying covering fire and retreating.\n\n\n     Soon enough, we had reached Santos. I heard him call out and he told us to get behind the sentry turrets as he activated them. The turrets rapidly fired into the oncoming crowd of devils, as the rest of us caught our breath. Before the demons could halt their attack, they were being torn into left and right, ash filling up the tunnel from the preposterous amounts of hellspawn being sent back to the netherworld. By the time the turrets were drained of their ammunition, only a few demons that had not turned tail and ran poked their heads out from the ruined tunnels. Among them was that dumb bastard Telacor.\n\n\n     \"My master will not be pleased,\" the demon hissed at us, pointing his fat fingers at each of us. His words slurred like he hadn't held an actual conversation in years. \"Your souls will be harvested for the pleasures of those I serve.\"\n\n\n     \"Perhaps,\" Flaherty retorted. \"But not today.\" \n\n\n     She aimed her rifle at Telacor, attempting to finish him off. He could take quite a beating, more so than his minions, but in the open and with a hailstorm of holy rounds, he would go down like the rest. Just as Flaherty fixed her sights on the trifling demon before us, a portal opened behind it. He performed a short, mock bow before leaping through the rift. It closed as we fired into it, having no effect. The remaining few demons looked at each other, then toward us. We picked them off with ease. \n\n\n     After that, everything went on as normal. A Blackhawk came to pick us up, along with the surviving homeless woman, who somehow was still clinging to life. We were debriefed by command on the mission, thanked for our valiant effort, and sent on our way. This operation was fairly routine for our squad. While we don't do this every day, Triton-9 has done it enough where some missions seem more lackluster than others. Of course, I have more tales from my service in the Extranormal Warfare Initiative, and I'm sure I'll have them posted in the coming days. Until then, stay safe.

        "text": "For a little bit of context, I'm 27 and I'm a writer. I have three published books. \n\nThe one relevant to this story hasn't been finished yet. It's about a serial killer. It has 9 relevant characters, not including the killer. All characters are based around real people that I know, or know of. Some are friends of mine, some colleagues, my girlfriend, my younger brother, one celebrity, and the main character is based around me, which is kind of weird, I know. \n\nThe killer isn't really based on anyone, it was simply a pigment of my imagination, inspired by a combination of other famous serial killers. \n\nThe killer uses a variety of creative and painful methods to torture and kill in my book, to instill fear. If he catches you, you better pray you die a quick and painless death, which never happened. \n\nThe first to die was Jonathan, he was based on a celebrity, and he too was a celebrity in the book. He was kidnapped on a friday night, while walking home for a long weekend where he had already informed everyone to not call, because he wouldn't answer. Which was the perfect time for the killer to strike. \n\nSince he was an actor, the killer tortured him by permanently ruining his looks, his face, his arms and legs. Over the 48 hours, they were burnt, cut, damaged, tattooed. His tongue was cut out. His misery was ended by a gun. A simple gunshot to the head, quite an anticlimatic finisher for all the torture he had to go through. \n\nAs you know most serial killers keep a souvenir from their victims, this one did too, and a weird one at that. He always took their left shoe and sock. \n\nYou might be wondering why I am telling you all this? I already said how the characters in this book are based on real people. Well one of them died last week, exactly as described in my fucking book. The actor that I just told you about. He was kidnapped on a friday, tortured by ruining his entire body, and then killed with a gunshot to the head. I saw it on the news a couple days ago. It was gruesome.\n\nHow the fuck is that possible? It can't be a copycat, the book isn't published yet, only a very select few of people even know of its existence. \n\nI decided called my mom, who was one of the characters in the book to talk about this.\n\n\"Did you see the news?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" My mother responded\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I blurted out\n\nShe sighed. \"I'm sure this is just a big coincidence.\" \n\n\"Yeah right, down to the fucking missing left shoe and sock.\" \n\nShe gasped. \"That wasn't in the news?\" She said, confused.\n\n\"I know, I googled.\" The document was on my laptop, which was always in my apartment, and also locked with a password only I knew. \n\n\"Who else knows of the book?\" My mom asked, I think she began thinking what I was thinking. \n\n\"Only the eight people I used as a reference while writing and my editor.\" \n\n\"Will you call them?\" A deep sigh escaped my mouth. \n\n\"Yeah.\" I muttered out. \n\n\"Alright, let me know, love you.\" \n\n\"Love you too mom.\" I hung up.\n\nThe rest of the calls to the rest of the people went the same. None of them had told anyone about it or shared the first draft I had given them. The actor never knew there was a character based on him. Now that I think about it.. No one knew this was the actor I was using as a reference point.. So how the hell? my head was hurting from all this thinking. Maybe it was just a big coincidence. \n\nThe following few days I read the first few pages again, to see just how accurate it was to the crime that was comitted. It was 100% accurate. The copycat, or whatever it is didn't miss a thing. I kept reading, the second victim was coming up. It was based on a close friend of mine. She got into the wrong cab, thinking it was her uber. She was awoken in a dark, cold and empty warehouse, tied to a chair. Her torture was by far the worst. She's a therapist, so the killer made her feel. Really feel. All five of her senses were turned into pure pain. Her entire body was made to hurt with every little movement. Her ears were made to bleed by blasting disturbing sounds into her ears beyond what a human can handle. Her eyes were glued wide open, if she tried to close them, she'd feel the skin trying to rip away from the glue. She had something very hot, not spicy, but temperature hot shoved into her mouth. And then her mouth was tied shut so she couldn't speak. \n\nThis was pain alright. She died 17 hours after being kidnapped from shock. \n\nThis close friend who the character is based on, her name is Sasha, she was reported missing three hours ago. She was supposed to get into an uber and drive to one of our mutual friends for drinks, but she never arrived there. Her phone was off and there was no way to contact her. They called the cops. \n\nThis is too real.. just too real. How can this be happening? It can't. It just.. it can't. \n\nSomeone is killing the people in my book. I was in shock. I was crying. I needed to go to the police. I needed to tell them. Maybe they could still find Sasha, I mean I had the location as well, not the exact one, but a warehouse should make the search much, much easier, no?\n\nI dialed 911. \n\n\"Hello what is your emergency.\" A kind, warm, but alarmed voice asked from the other end.\n\n\"I uh.. I don't know how to say this uh.. My friend, Sasha, she was reported missing a couple hours ago and well, a couple days ago a celebrity was kidnapped and murdered.. And I have an unpublished book.. this book describes these kidnappings and murders.. I think someone is copying the killer from my book..\" It felt like a heavy rock was lifted off my shoulders when I finished speaking, but my heart dropped when the voice responded.\n\n\"Listen, this is 911, we don't take kind to prank calls, so unless there's an actual emergency going on, I'm going to hang up.\" The voice sounded annoyed, almost angry.\n\n\"No! Wait! You don't understand! Someone is killing people in my book!\" I blurted out desperately. \n\n\"First the actor, now my friend who went missing, then there's more who will die!\"\n\nNo response. I look at my phone. The call has ended, they hung up. I just began sobbing right then and there. It took me a while to calm down, but once I did, I made a decision. If they're not going to help me, then I will find Sasha myself. \n\nI got into my car and began driving, with no real destination in mind. I just knew she'd be in a warehouse. She had to be. \n\nI drove to every local warehouse around her last location, both abandoned and not. Because I was stupid enough to not specify that in my book. \n\nI got to the third before final warehouse on my list and got out of my car to investigate. It was abbandoned. There was a side door entrance and I tried the handle. It was locked. I walked around the entire building, there were no cars in sight. The warehouse was pretty spacey, and had two metal gates that could be opened from inside. I found no way to get in, and I couldn't just break in. So I sighed and got back into my car and drove away. \n\nThe next two warehouses were much the same. Feeling defeated I checked in with the other friends, to see if they heard anything from Sasha, but the answer was unfortunately no. \n\nI drove home feeling helpless and hopeless. Blaming myself for what might currently be happening to her, for the pain she's going through. I cried myself to sleep.\n\nI woke up the next morning to a bombardment of messages from friends and family, some telling me how sorry they are, others asking what the fuck was going on, and if they were going to die too. I put the two and two together. Sasha was found. I quickly opened the news and sure enough she had been found. Dead, strapped to a chair, in an abbandoned warehouse. The address was on display. My blood froze. That was one of the warehouses I was at yesterday, I just couldn't get in. If only I got in I could have saved her. \n\nIt's all my fault that Sasha is dead. My mom called me and we talked about it again. She tried to console me, but it wasn't working. \n\nI decided to try and go to the police this time, instead of calling. I was turned away once again, because, and I quote: \"No one has the time to entertain your theories of a serial killer.\" \n\nI cursed them out then and there, which got me thrown out, luckily not into a jail cell. \n\nI'm determined to save my remaining friends and family, I can't let them all die. According to my book the next to fall victim is Illiya, my ex. I already called her and she agreed to meet up, which is happening in less than an hour. \n\nI will try to update you all as soon as we come up with a plan.",

        "text": "A few years ago, I was on a trip to Manhattan island. Being the idiot I am, I left my cash and some of my luggage in a taxi. I was stranded in the middle of New York and I needed to find a hotel quickly. Luckily, there was one right next to where I was. It had a neon sign that said, \"The Sorcière Hotel.\" As I approached it, I immediately knew that something was off.\n\nThe hotel was a dingy tourist trap. Everything had some yellowish dirt on it and the walls looked like they hadn't been painted in years. I came up to the receptionist and asked for a room. I was repulsed by his strange smile. He gave me some keys and asked for my credit card. When I gave it to him, he swiped it and handed it back to me. I tried pulling it from his hand but he wouldn't let go. I had to use a good amount of force to grab it back. \"I'm sorry, this is my first day.\" is what he said. He asked, \"Can I carry your luggage?\" I didn't say anything, but he grabbed it anyways. He was odd, but he wasn't nearly as strange as the rest of the place.\n\nI went to use the elevator, but there was none. I sighed and went up the stairs. When I went to put my hand on the handrail, I noticed that it was coated in some sort of translucent goop. When I finally got to my door, I opened it and noticed that there was a man in my room. I asked, \"What are you doing here?\" He said, \"I'm just checking your room, sir.\" and left. While he was leaving, I got a detailed glimpse of his facial features. He was a pale man with an almost cartoonishly long face. Unlike the rest of the employees who were smiling, he had a nonchalant expression. I would say that he looked almost depressed.\n\nI jumped onto my bed and noticed that my luggage was already in my room. I thought that this was strange as I didn't see the receptionist come up the stairs with me. At this point, I wanted to leave. I thought, \"Just one night.\" When I put my head on my pillow, I noticed that something was under it. I looked, and it was a dead rat. I was disgusted. I called room service and told them about it. They cleaned it up and I asked where it came from. A man with a large smile on his face said, \"Accidents happen. We are sorry.\" and left. I would have left, but it was 2:00 AM and I didn't have the energy. I was thinking, \"This day can't get any worse.\" It did.\n\nI tried to go to sleep, but I couldn't. This place was just too weird. At about 3:00 AM, my doorbell rang. I looked through the peephole and saw that pale man who was in my room earlier. I opened the door and he said to me, \"Hello, I am the owner, Gustavo. I've heard that you found a dead rat under your pillow?\" I replied, \"Yes. What about it?\" He told me, \"I'd like to give you some compensation. How about a night for free?\" I was about to say something when he left abruptly. What was wrong with these stupid people?\n\nWhile I was trying to sleep, I could here fighting from the other room. It sounded like two people were trying to kill each other. I could hear loud sounds of somebody being slammed against a wall. After a few minutes of this, I heard intense screaming. I didn't care how tired I was, I was going to leave now. As I went to the door, I saw something through the peephole. It kind of looked like a human but with ten fingers on each hand, rough and colorless skin, and purely white eyes. It's mouth was wide open, exposing its sharp teeth that were covered in blood. I stumbled back and hid under my sheets. That's all I could do at this point.\n\nAt around 6:00 AM, I was going to leave this place no matter what. I got out of bed, opened my door, and bolted out. I was running down the stairs when I tripped. Gustavo helped me up and said, \"Leaving so soon? You have another night for free!\" I escaped his grip and ran to the main lobby. There were at least fifty employees in here and they were all standing in a circle. When I came in, they all looked at me with their freaky smiles. At the same time, they all said, \"Leaving so soon? You have another night for free!\" They chanted this over and over while I ran out the door.\n\nWhen I got outside, I felt a sense of relief. I called the police and told them what had happened. They went to check the hotel, but it was gone. In its place was an old apartment building that hadn't been used in decades. If anybody has experience with The Sorcière Hotel, please tell me. We need to uncover this mystery.",

        "text": "First, let me start by providing some backstory to the area.  \nMy name is Devin, and I have lived in Arizona for a total of only about two years, and in that time, I have found myself enamored by the myths and legends surrounding the area. Arizona is no stranger to the mysterious and I often found myself passing the nights away reading stories of the Navajo Skinwalkers, the Mogollon Monster, El Chupacabra, and even some accounts of La Llorona.\n\nMe and my group of buddies loved Arizona, and often found ourselves taking week long camping trips up to Snowflake, Payson, or Heber. Throughout all of those trips, we had never seen or experienced anything too out of the ordinary.  The only notable occurrence we had ever encountered were some strange noises that could be heard at night around the campsites, but that was usually chalked up to nerves from being so far away from the city or a prank pulled by one of the other guys.\n\nWe would regularly gather around the fire and tell stories of the various cryptids and legends around the area, looking to creep each other out as we had a drink in order to add a sense of excitement to our usual trips.\n\nWe had never expected to witness any strange events ourselves.\n\nThis trip, the outing where it all happened, started just like the rest. Just four months ago, one September morning, our little ragtag group of six, Luke, Bobby, John, Derick, Jack, and myself worked to gather the necessary supplies for our next adventure. \n\nLuke and Bobby were in charge of general supplies, gathering tents, flashlights, and the like. They grabbed three two person tents, a few lanterns to set around the area as well as some handheld flashlights, some extra supplies that we would need to start a fire and cook food, and loaded the truck bed with some extra wood pallets to break down for the fire. \n\nJohn was on food duty, and arranged a plethora of canned and freeze-dried food, water bottles, and the most important camping staple, supplies for s'mores.\n\nWe had put Derrick and Jack on a beer run, and packed up a few cases of Coors, pack of corona, some seltzers, and even a small Dos Equis keg that one of them had grabbed because it looked cool.\n\nWhile everyone else was gathering supplies, I made arrangements and got any permits we would need. This time, we were heading to the San Tan Mountain Regional Park, which stood only about eight miles away from where we lived, which was a small trip compared to our usual outings. \n\nThe area was just south of the town of Queen Creek, where most of us lived, and a ways east from the Indian Reservation. The Park was a very popular camping spot and was usually booked out for most of the year and was quite hard to get an official reservation. Instead of going the traditional route, we decided it would be best to delve further into the territory than the set up camping grounds, as we wouldn't have to deal with other campers, and could party through the night without disturbing others. \n\nThat afternoon, we loaded up the truck to carry all of our supplies, and piled in to be on our way. We each brought with us a rifle as it would be our method of defense. We did not bring them expecting to have to use them, but it had just become a common practice to be prepared for the worst, so they usually just sat in the truck nearby or in the tents bagged up. \n\nAfter our trucks were loaded up, we drove the relatively short distance to the grounds and delved deep into the territory until we found a suitable spot.\n\nThe entire park was covered in brush, cacti, and rocky cliffs which was a change from the usual forests we camped out in. We decided on a spot that was bordered by some small rock formations and had already been somewhat cleared of large brush.\n\nWhen we stepped out of the trucks, it was obvious that the spot had been used before as there sat a circle of rocks that was obviously for a fire and the site was littered with abandoned camping supplies. There was trash and empty beer bottles strewn about and even a tent that lied flat on the ground. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the tent was torn to shreds and covered with what looked like large marks made by claws. We thought that this was strange but just chalked it up to a wild animal nesting in it at one point or some crazy campers riding a high and freaking out.\n\n\"Who would just leave all of this out here?\" I said, bewildered at the lack of consideration from the previous campers. \n\n\"Some people.\" Derick said back generally, shaking his head side to side.\n\nWe grabbed some bags from the truck and proceeded to clean up the site a bit before we began to set up our tents, a process that only took about an hour. Around this time, the sun had begun to set so we began breaking down a pallet and setting up a fire.\n\nThat night was uneventful and was just a small diner of canned stews and a few beers afterward before we settled down to bed. \n\nOur three tents were split between John and Derrick, Luke and Jack, and finally Bobby and myself. We were already pretty tired from our earlier preparations and found ourselves dozing off pretty quickly. \n\nSometime in the early morning, it couldn't have been earlier than 3:00am, I suddenly woke up in a cold sweat. I sat up in my sleeping bag and looked around to see Bobby passed out to my right. I was still groggy but I could just barely hear the sound of footsteps from nearby my tent over Bobby's snores. I would usually just pass it off as someone getting up to take a piss, but something about the sound of the steps unsettled me. There was no rhythm or reason to them like a normal humans footsteps would. It was like something large was limping or just learning how to walk. That is when I noticed the smell. It smelled like a mixture of rotting meat and mildew, like what wet clothes smell like when they have sat in a pile for a few days. \n\nIt was overpowering, I could barely even think, my eyes began to water and I think I even gagged a few times. I unzipped my tent and stepped outside quickly to throw up. I emptied the contents of my stomach on the rocks a couple of feet away from the tent and proceeded to dry heave for the next minute or two. The smell had gotten worse when I exited the tent, and as I sat there, trying to pass this feeling of dread that had begun to build up in the pit of my stomach, I felt as if I was being watched from somewhere behind me.\n\nI whipped around frantically and looked past the other two tents, fumbling for my little battery powered flashlight in my pocket, quickly clicking it on, and pointing in the direction I felt I was being watched from and saw nothing. absolutely nothing. I shined the light left and right, scanning the open clearing and the nearby cliffs, and just as quickly as it had come, the horrendous stench which had plagued the campsite quickly subsided. \n\nI clicked my flashlight back off, and sat down on a big rock next to my tent and tried for the next few minutes to slow my breathing and calm my nerves. After what must have been thirty minutes, I had calmed down just a little, and crawled back into my tent and finally dozed off again. \n\nThat morning, I proceeded to tell the group what I had experienced that night and was quickly met with laughter by the others.\n\n\"Its unusual to see you so freaked out by nothing Devin.\" Jack said to me jokingly.\n\n\"If you get scared at night Devin you can crawl into my tent and cuddle with me.\" Derrick said with a grin.\n\n\"Very funny.\" I said back.\n\n\"Are you sure you didn't have too much to drink last night?\" Bobby, my tent mate, asked as he finally crawled out from the tent, putting his hands in the air in a stretch and letting out a yawn.\n\nI thought about it. Could that smell and feeling really have been a fallacy created by my drunk mind?   \nIt had felt so real, and there is no way I could mistake that smell. Even now, hours later, I still felt my stomach rumble when I thought of it. Not to mention the footsteps.\n\n\"I don't know.\" I finally said, trying to move on.\n\nThe day went by without any occurrence and I forgot about the events of last night and just tried to have fun. That night we all sat around the campfire again, drinking a beer and telling scary stories, just a normal night. Sometime later, John was telling a story and Derick stood up to walk away.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" I called out to him.\n\n\"I just gotta piss.\" he called back as he faded into the darkness of the night\n\nJohn continued telling his story, and about five minutes in to it, we heard the yelling and running footsteps of Derick as he basically tumbled into one of the tents. \n\nWe leapt to our feet and quickly asked him what was wrong, running over to where he had fallen.  \nHe pointed a finger back to where he had just came from and began to babble nonsense, and that's when I noticed he was shaking uncontrollably. Luke knelt down next to him and placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Calm down buddy, tell me what you saw.\" he said soothingly, trying to get him to calm down.\n\n\"There's something out there!\" Derick cried. \"It looked like some kind of person or something, but it was fucked up, and it smelt so fucking bad.\"\n\nWe proceeded to look around at each other. Derick was usually the most level headed out of all of us, widely considered as the mother of the group, and he rarely ever drank or got drunk, so we took it seriously when he told us what he saw, but we had not entirely pieced it together yet.\n\n\"What could it be?\" Luke said to the group.\n\n\"I'm not sure, maybe some kind of wild animal?\" John said back.\n\n\"I think we should pull out the guns, just to be safe.\" I said.\n\n\"Good idea.\" Luke agreed.\n\nWe honestly should have realized then that it was time to leave, but we were stubborn. We thought that we were invincible, that nothing could happen to us, that anything strange could be explained rationally. Sure we liked to tell stories of mysterious creatures and occurrences but those were just that, stories, right?\n\nWe each pulled out our hunting rifles and sat back around the fire once again, trying to stay calm in light of what just happened. That's when we started to hear the sounds.\n\nIt sounded like screaming, all around us. It sounded like it was coming from one source but it was coming from multiple places and directions, like whatever was making the noise was travelling around us impossibly fast. John pointed out that it sounded like Derick's scream. I realized that he was right. It sounded exactly like how Derick had yelled earlier when he ran back to camp. Like his scream had been recorded and was played over a speaker over and over again. It sounded artificial, like an animal was trying to mimic a human scream.\n\nThat's when I noticed the smell. That ungodly stench had returned, and this time, everyone else could smell it.\n\nWe were all standing up at this point, backs pointed towards the fire, aiming our rifles out into the darkness, trying our best to cover our noses to block out that mind numbing stench. Then suddenly, the sounds just stopped, and the smell subsided. \n\nWe had a hard time falling asleep that night, yet despite what we had just experienced, we weren't quite ready to leave yet. To this day, ill never know why we didn't just leave.\n\nLater in the night, I was once again awoken suddenly, only to realize that smell had returned. At this point I was done, I was tired of being afraid of whatever was out here in the wilderness, just outside of my home.\n\nI grabbed my rifle that was sitting next to my sleeping bag, quietly unzipped the tent, and poked my head out to see what was outside.\n\nWhat I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nStanding upright, just past the dying embers of the camp fire, hunched over the one of the tents, was an abomination of which I had no name for. \n\nIt was tall, at least seven feet tall, and was covered head to toe in sickly pale skin that seemed to almost reflect in the moonlight. In different spots, its body seemed to be almost rotting, with different patches of flesh hanging loosely off of its body and limbs.\n\nAs I took a closer look at it, I noticed its gangly arms held down by its sides were different lengths. One arm was longer than the other, and not just slightly, but by a few inches. Its arms were skinny and bony, seemed impossible long, and had joints turning in all the wrong areas. At the end of its hands it had what looked to be long fingerlike claws. \n\nI was not able to get a good look at its face yet as it was turned away from me, standing over one of the tents across from me.\n\nI felt this rising sense of indescribable dread as I watched it. I thought of all the possibilities in my head, thinking back to the torn up tent that we had noticed when we first arrived, I imagined that at any moment, this creature could rip through the tent and my friends with its claws before they could even react. \n\nWith a burst of adrenaline, I open my tent the rest of the way slowly, walk quietly outside, and aim my rifle at the head of this creature.\n\nJust before I am about to shoot this thing, I hear Bobby's fearful yell behind me.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!\" He yells.\n\nThe creature in front of me whips around at an impossible speed. That's when I saw its face for the first time. It had deep hollow sockets where its eyes were and its eyes glowed a menacing yellow. Its mouth stood agape with a fear inducing set of jagged sharp teeth, and it let out a mind numbing screech that sounded like a mix of a high pitch screech and low growl.\n\nI tried to shoot it, but I either missed, or the bullet did no damage to it, as it pounced on top of me, knocking me down, and dug its claws into the sides or my torso.\n\nI screamed in pain, feeling the creatures claws digging into my flesh looking into the eyes of this thing on top of me, smelling its rancid breath almost causing me to pass out.\n\nat this point everyone else had already woken up, and the other five men jumped out of their tents in a flurry, aiming their rifles at this thing and unloaded into it, trying their best not to hit me in the process.\n\nThe barrage of gunfire most have at least injured it because in recoiled in some kind of pain and got off me, releasing me from its clawed death grip and stumbled a few yards away. \n\nIn that moment, Derick and Luke grabbed me as John, Jack, and Bobby reloaded and continue to fire in the direction it stumbled off into. I winced with pain as Derick and Luke lift me up. That dreadful screech fills our ears once again as we book it to the trucks.\n\nWe pile in quickly, leaving behind all of our tents and supplies, and start to speed away.\n\nThis thing must have been chasing us, because that scream seemed to follow us.\n\n\"How is it this fast? Were going like 80 miles an hour!\" Said Bobby in the driver seat as he pressed the pedal to the floor, trying his best to maneuver the pitch black landscape to get back to the trails.\n\n\"I- I don't know\" Derick was stammering as he begun to put pressure on the deep wounds on my side as I groaned in pain.\n\nThe road was bumpy and it felt like we were being pushed and pulled in different directions as we drove. The sound of the creatures shrieks and creaking metal filled our ears. \n\nEventually, we couldn't hear the sounds of the creature anymore, but we never once slowed down, speeding past the checkpoint to enter the park and speeding trough the lit town streets.\n\nI must have passed out along the way because the next thing I remember is waking up two days later in a hospital bed. apparently, after I was stable, my friends went to the police and the park rangers, telling them what we had experienced. They left out some of the more unbelievable details but recounted details of the creature, the sound it made, and the smell.\n\nThe authorities seemed skeptical at first but were more inclined to believe that something was out there after seeing the state that I was in and seeing the damage done to the trucks.\n\nWhat I had not yet seen or noticed was that the trucks were covered in large deep claw marks on the sides and the back bumper was torn off. That's when I realized that we had just barely escaped with our lives.\n\nWhat was this thing? How could it be fast enough to chase a high speed truck? How could it have the strength to rip through a metal frame like paper? Why didn't bullets seem to hurt it?\n\nI was filled with so many questions that I did not particularly want the answers to.\n\nWhen I was finally released from the hospital, and reunited with my friends, we never spoke about the events that happened on that trip.\n\nI don't even know why I am typing this out. Maybe just to get it off my chest so I can finally move on, but I must warn everyone reading this.\n\nBe careful when camping deep in the San Tan Mountains.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started the voice recorder. I couldn’t go into the room personally, due to potential violence. He started talking about what happened, and I decided to leave for a bit. Around an hour later, I came back, and he finished. I let him go. The following text is a transcript of the recording.\n\nMe and my colleague started performing the autopsy. We didn’t know how he died, so we started looking into it. It looked like another case of SADS. (Sudden adult death syndrome) But we knew SOMETHING had to be happening. \n\nThere was no obvious evidence of how he died, so we decided to look in his house, to see if we could find mold, or anything toxic. It could be something that doesn’t show up on a toxin screen, and someone killed him intentionally. After all, this was the 5th SADS case in around two weeks, all within this general area. We rechecked his body to see if we could find any punctures, but we found nothing. \n\nWe decided to enter his house. On the first day, we didn’t find anything. Just a dusty old book and some kind of hornet’s nest. We kept searching, and found something strange. A closet full of blindfolds, and a smashed mirror.\n\nWe were weirded out at this point. We decided to look into his computer and search history next.\n\n“Why are my eyes turning yellow”\n\n“Pinkeye symptoms”\n\n“Diseases that turn people’s eyes yellow”\n\n“What do dreams mean”\n\n“Dementia symptoms”  \n \n\nIt was clear that something had happened with his eyes, and they turned yellow. Pinkeye was the closest I could think of, but it’s rare to die from it. My colleague saw a decently new book. I read it.\n\n“I think I might be having dementia. I sometimes go for long periods of time just staring at a wall. I usually forget what I’ve been doing for a couple hours. I decided to keep a journal and write down everything I’ve done. How do I get dementia at 21? I wonder if this is linked to the dream I’ve been having.”\n\nWe decided to look in his bedroom. We saw a dreamcatcher, as if he’s been trying to block out the dream. We found nothing else, and decided to look in the book again.\n\n“I will also use this book to document every dream I’ve been having, to make sure I’m actually having the exact same one each night.\n\n9:00: I ate breakfast and called my friends. At 9:30, I finished my breakfast and went to work.\n\n3:00: I can’t remember anything that happened previously. Why didn’t I write in the journal?\n\nI’m going to go to sleep.”\n\n“7:00: I woke up from a dream. The dream was of me waking up in my office, and walking around. Then, a man with a fedora and suit appeared at my desk. It looked at me, and its neck started cracking. It was like some sort of demented giraffe. Its neck craned so it could look at me. It smiled, and its hands started growing. It tried to grab me, but I ran away. I appear in a hallway, and the door in front of me is locked. I see it standing at the other end. I feel like its sucking my soul away, while it looks at me with this cold, dead, smile.”\n\nI was utterly terrified at this point. My colleague started hyperventilating. I started looking around some more. We couldn’t find anything else, so we took the journal and went back to the morgue. We kept performing the autopsy, but this time we took what the journal said into consideration. We called his parents and asked them if dementia ran in the family. They said no. I jokingly said to my colleague “Has to be a demon then, haha.” He looked at me, and I could tell he genuinely thought that. He suddenly had to go. I decided to head home too, and go to bed.\n\nThe next day, my colleague came to me, crying. He was wearing sunglasses, but I could see how puffy his eyes were. He told me about something that had happened last night. Just thinking about it just makes me terrified.   \n \n\nHe told me that he had a dream last night. It was about the man the book described. It started with him appearing in our workplace, and walking over to the dead body we were performing the autopsy on. The body slowly started changing, until it was perfect. A normal person. However, it didn’t look fully formed. It didn’t have eyes, or ears. \n\nIt stood up and started walking to my colleague. He tried to run, but he was mesmerized. His hands started contorting, until they looked the same as the bodies. Clawed, and completely burned. He woke up again in a dark box, with laughing around him. He felt a needle poking him repeatedly. \n\nHe woke up in his car, cruising along the road. He quickly snapped awake completely, and drove to work. At this point, we definitely knew something was up. I brought the book in, and started to read. Everything past this point was gibberish, as if something was trying to mimic human language.\n\nI kept reading, until the last page with writing on it appeared.\n\n“ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME ITS NOT ME”\n\nIt was terrifying. It seemed like he was writing it while running. All of a sudden, my coworker gripped his head. He sounded different. He told me he had to go home. That’s when I had an idea.\n\nI went to the body, and cut open its head. I grabbed its brain, to see if anything weird was there. I found- oh god. It was horrifying. 7, huge poke marks. Like a 7- pronged fork, but the prongs were in a circular shape. I felt like throwing up, but I kept investigating. I grabbed some tweezers, and poked a hole. A strange, purple fluid came out. Just smelling it made me woozy. I guessed it was some kind of thing to slow people down, since I got woozy just smelling it.\n\nI decided to head to my coworkers house, and tell him about it. I walked in, and immediately almost passed out. I wore a face mask, but that didn’t work. I put 3 on, and it worked perfectly. I walked into his room, and saw him. He was lying on the floor, dead. His eyes were open, and I looked into them. Yellow. Just like the last person.   \n   \n \n\nI called 911, and when they arrived, he was immediately pronounced dead. His body was already decomposing, and there was a weird bee hive. They sprayed it with pesticides, and the whole hive fell to the floor. A weird, spider thing fell out. Someone with a lab coat took it. The same lab coat that YOU guys wear, might I add. \n\nWHY are you making me do this? You have the purple stuff, and the creature, Why do I have to bring up my friends death? \n\n(The person was silent, with only occasional sobs heard. He resumed after precisely 5 minutes and 7 seconds.)\n\nAnyway, back to what happened. I immediately opened the poor guy’s head when they sent him to me to do an autopsy. The same 7 puncture marks. I decided to look into the mirror. My eyes were normal, luckily. It’s been around a week, and I think I’m good. That’s all I can remember. Now please let me out?\n\n(End tape.)\n\nHello? Is this thing on? Alright.\n\nThanks to this voice recording, along with many others, we were able to get relatively good info on the thing.\n\nSubject A, aka the Dream Man, is a spider-like parasite that attaches onto a host’s brain, attempting to completely control them. However, this usually fails, resulting in the host’s death. However, thanks to it maturing in the brain, it can survive in the outside world. It is affected by standard pesticides, leading it to be rather simple to control its population. \n\nLifecycle: Subject A starts as a tiny larva, born in a hive made by an adult. Eventually, due to it being very small, around the size of a tiny gnat, it can be easily breathed in by a human. Sometimes, the hive releases blasts of purple smoke containing a substance that dazes the host, and stops pain. It also contains larvae. If the smoke is breathed in, you must immediately expose your brain to radiation in 24 hours. Any kind will do, but before long, the larva will be able to use your brain as a host, no matter what, it will always get through, even if it has to bite. Killing it would mean killing your brain.\n\nEventually, the symptoms begin. The larvae grows needle like appendages, which get longer as it grows. They inject into the brain, releasing a similar substance to the purple smoke. This substance stops you from feeling much pain while the needles also absorb vital nutrients. This leads to a yellow tinge of the eyes. Eventually, the larvae grows into a spider like creature. The creature begins adding something else into the substance. It is unknown why, but this substance makes it seem like some demonic entity is hunting you. It appears in your dreams, and it slowly seems to be possessing you. It is unknown if this is just to hide itself, and make itself look like a paranormal entity, or if it is unintentional.\n\nAfter the spider like creature gains enough nutrients, it attempts complete control of the host. It tries numerous times, but the host usually regains consciousness afterwards. Mostly, this happens while the host is dreaming of the demonic entity. If the host is unconscious for around 12 hours, the parasite attempts to kill the host’s brain. This, kills the host. Due to the host not producing enough nutrients, the parasite leaves through any orifice, usually the mouth or ear canal, and starts building a hive out of purple substance, which turns yellow in time.\n\nIf anyone here tries to enter a victims house, they must cover their face as much as possible. They don’t want to die slowly and painfully, right? Also, my coworkers may create more logs. Long story.  \n   \n \n\nAlright. Tape recorders off. Subject A recorded, send it to the boss… dang it. Forgot to turn it off. Eh, whatever. Going to make a transcript, either way. I can always delete this. \n\n\\-Liam",

        "text": "John let out a long exhale and slowly let go of the anger he had been feeling for the few hours. “I suppose I couldn’t ask for a better view” he thought as he stared out at the lake. He always felt better looking past the trees to the secluded shoreline. Many years earlier he had been living on the southern shore of the same lake, but there were always loud parties and boat traffic nearby. This was much better, nobody to make noise and no neighbors to draw the curtains for.\n\nThe view was commanding, a clear blue lake framed by tall cedars. He loved this view, even in the middle of winter. He had worked hard for this and wasn’t going to give it up without a fight. That judge last year had certainly understood, and it certainly helped that John had Dr Philips in his pocket in convincing him that John was still more than capable of living on his own, though with limited assistance. Having his driver’s license revoked was a bit of a blow, though not entirely unexpected. \n\nThat agency found Shelly, his home assistant. “This will definitely be one time I’m looking forward to seeing her” John thought. It wasn’t that he disliked her, more that he resented that she was necessary. Pleasant enough, with an easy smile and a sensible style, she was well past retirement age yet still working. There seemed to be resentment on both sides, and John had told her once that it wasn’t his fault for poor decisions in her past. That had not gone over well. \n\n“She’s late” John thought to himself. The one time I really, really need her, she’s freaking late.” Then he had a thought. “Oh my god, is she going to wig out when she finds me” he thought to himself and chuckled, then winced at the sharp pain in his side. “What a fucking mess.” Laying on the floor, he surveyed the damage. There was a bookcase, on top of him. It pinned his left arm and leg to the floor. While he had a decent view of the living room and the lake beyond to his right, behind him the couch limited his view to the kitchen cabinets and the ceiling of the adjoining hall, although the empty space on the upper wall seemed to suggest something. John looked back to the lake. It was getting dark. “Damn rotator cuff” he thought as he struggled again. It was no use. Even with two good arms, he would have had considerable difficulty lifting this thing. This big wooden thing. He felt nauseous. And thirsty.\n\nWhere was she?  Shelly wasn’t punctual, but she should have been here by now. What time was she supposed to be there? What was today?  John thought back to a shouting match some months ago where he had lost track and accused her of blowing him off. Had she been there today already? This was bad. Perhaps he had misjudged and she was coming tomorrow. Even if she had come earlier today, she would still be there within 48 hours, give or take. Every other day, that’s what the agency had guaranteed. Still, this was not good. Somewhere he remembered that most people can survive 3-4 days without water. “That gives me at least a good day or two of cushion” he thought. “I need to conserve my energy” After a while, he drifted off to sleep.\n\nHis dreams were disturbing. Something nameless and dark was pursuing him. He ran down the sidewalk in agonizingly slow, labored steps. Faceless shapes turned as if to stare, accusingly. The weight on his limbs making each movement agonizingly slow. He felt something cold along his back. John awoke with a start, noticing at once the throbbing needles in his leg and arm, his pajamas and robe moist with sweat. And urine. He had pissed himself.\n\nThe sun was coming up. His mouth was parched and dry. What was going on? Where was he? He looked around to see. Bookcase. Leg. Arm. Floor. How did this happen? Where was that lady? The one with the smile? Had he missed her scheduled visit? Had she visited and he had forgotten it?  Yes, he was forgetful, but he reminded himself that his condition was more than just memory loss. He rocked the bookcase, testing it. He could feel a grinding above his knee, but the pain seemed dulled by a prickly numbness. Grunting with exertion, he was able to extract the limb, inch by inch, ignoring the increasingly sharp sensation of pain in his leg. Finally his arm was free. He felt a wave of nausea as the pain increased, first in his arm as the blood rushed back in, then in his leg. He lay there for a while, and when he had recovered his breathing, he took an assessment. While he now had both arms free, the bookcase was still too heavy to lift from this position, while he had almost certainly fractured his leg or hip. At least he could lean up higher to better survey the room. Perhaps there was something he missed, something he could use to free himself or signal for help. He craned his neck, looking over the couch when he spotted it. White. Oblong. A shoe, flecked with red. A sensible shoe.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you need to get caught up, you can do so [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z4h896/my_town_has_an_abandoned_chuck_e_cheeses_i_should/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I had no ulterior motives behind my work. I just wanted to write entertaining horror stories. But no matter my motivation, I’ve put people’s lives in danger and it’s my responsibility to fix this- well, as much as I can at least. \n\nI don’t know when all this *actually* started, but I would’ve been completely oblivious if it wasn’t for my brother, Jake. \n\nJake burst into my room, clutching his phone like his life depended on it. \n\n“Matt, you have to read this news article. It’s scary similar to one of the stories you just wrote.”\n\n“What? Let me see,” I requested, itching to know who was ripping off my work.\n\nI snatched the phone out of Jake’s hand. All the color drained from my face. \n\n*Three Arkansas College Students: Daniel Chen, Savannah Mullen, and Trent Baker Were Reported Missing Yesterday After a Minnesota Hiking Trip Gone Wrong.*\n\nI gulped. My throat began drying up faster than a worm on hot pavement. The article went on to say that their friends, Jeff Vandervurst and Rachel Glass, reported them missing after they were caught in a freak snowstorm on a hike. I knew what really happened.\n\n“The wendigo. It…” I couldn’t finish the sentence, anxiety overwhelming me. \n\n“Disposed of their bodies? Yeah, that or the uncle did. Jeff and Rachel survived. Does that mean they killed the wendigo?” Jake wondered aloud, finishing my thought. \n\n“I- I don’t know. There’s too many details of mine to be a coincidence, though. Were you able to find anything else? Like anything from my other stories?” I probed, dreading his response. \n\n“Uh, I didn’t think about it. Let me see, what should I look up?” \n\n“Search ‘Charlene obituary.’ If I’m right, there should be an article from a month or two ago,” I instructed, returning his phone. \n\n“No freaking way. Here it is. It says Charlene Adkins, twenty-eight, passed away in a motor accident. Her memory lives on through her parents: Charlie Morrison, Anne Morrison, and her loving husband, Martin.”\n\n“That confirms it. My stories really are coming to life…” I mumbled as I stared numbly at my monitor. \n\n“Well, what are we going to do? Can you just delete the posts? Maybe that’ll make this all disappear.”\n\n“No, that won’t work. My posts have been viewed by thousands of readers and they’ve been shared hundreds of times. There’s no telling how many people have seen them.”\n\n“Brag much? Anyway, what are we going to do? We can’t just let these things run rampant, and I doubt the police will believe us if we tell them a bunch of psychos and monsters are on the loose.”\n\nI paused, drinking in the sickening reality of my predicament. I knew what I had to do.\n\n“*I* have to fix this. *We* won’t be doing anything.”\n\n“No. Whatever you have to do, I’m going with you. I know all your stories like the back of my hand, and I’m not letting you fight these things alone,” he said, crossing his arms in defiance. \n\nFiery determination gleamed in his eyes.\n\n“Jake, I know you want to help, but I can’t risk you getting hurt because of me. I created these freaks and now I have to clean up my mess.”\n\n“Look, Matt, I know you’re set on defeating these things on your own, but you’re my little brother and I can’t bear the thought of something happening to you. This is my decision, and I know what I’m getting myself into.”\n\nI sighed. \n\n“You’re sure about this? You know what we’re up against.”\n\n“I’ve never been more sure of anything in my entire life.”\n\nI closed my eyes and rubbed my temples. \n\n“Fine, you can come. But you got yourself into this. It’s not on me if-”\n\n“I knew you’d come around little bro!” he yelled, ruffling my hair; he knew I hated that.\n\n“Where do we start?” Jake implored as I contemplated our next move. \n\n“I’ll organize a list from the top priorities to the ones that can wait. You remember where I keep my pistol, right?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Good. Bring it to me.”\n\nJake reemerged, handing me my .9 millimeter. I tucked it into my waistline and rotated my screen to show him the list I’d organized. He frowned.\n\n“Bro, come on. Mr. Pip is second on this list? I freaking hate clowns.” \n\n“Yeah, that kid is in danger. He’s got a paranormal insane clown in his closet. It’s not too late to back out if you’re scared.”\n\n“No, uh, I’ll be fine… But why is the creepy dude on the balcony at the top of the list? Isn’t he one of the *least* threatening antagonists you have?”\n\n“Yeah well, Sidney’s life is in danger, and I figured it would be good practice for everything else we’re going to face.”\n\n“Okay, that makes sense. But where do we even start?”\n\n“I actually have her phone number. I’ll just give her a call and-”\n\n“Wait, is this that girl from your science class last year? You seriously wrote one of your classmates into a story?” \n\n“Um, I-”\n\n“Oh, I know what’s going on here. You want to go to Sidney’s first because you know her and you feel bad for getting her into this. That, or you have a crush on her,” he teased, wiggling his eyebrows up and down. \n\n“Oh, shut up, I don’t have a crush on her. I’ll just call her real quick and we’ll be on the road.”\n\nI could sense my face flush with color as my cheeks turned red. I searched for Sidney’s contact in my phone. I waited with bated breath as the phone rang. \n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Uh, hey Sidney, it’s Matt from your science class last year. Um listen, I have something to tell you and it’s going to sound really crazy, so just bear with me here.”\n\n“Okay, what is it?”\n\n“I know about the man on your balcony. I know he’s real, and I think you could be in danger.”\n\n“H-how do you know about that? Have you been talking to my therapist? Did she tell you, huh?” \n\n“No, I swear I didn’t talk to-”\n\nShe ended the call.\n\n“That went well,” Jake uttered. \n\n“Hey, what was I supposed to do? There’s not really a subtle way to bring that up.”\n\nJust then I received a text message. It was from Sidney. \n\n*218 Fairfield Drive, 11 PM. Don’t be late.* \n\n“Seriously? That’s in like forty-five minutes!” Jake exclaimed, peeking over my shoulder to read the text. \n\n“I don’t think we’re really in a position to argue. Pack the essentials. We’re leaving.”\n\nWe arrived at Sidney’s at eleven on the dot. My car crept up the driveway as we soaked in our surroundings. My story hadn’t done the house justice.\n\nIt was massive, encompassing a large plot of land. It appeared to have fallen into disrepair some time ago. Shutters hung lazily on their hinges, ready to come plummeting down at the slightest gust of wind. Several windows were damaged, large cracks spider-webbing across the glass. The house desperately needed a new paint job. Multiple spots had lost their coating, while the rest was peeling like snakeskin. And at the center of it all, the marble balcony loomed dauntingly overhead. \n\n“Man, why’d you have to make this place so creepy?” Jake muttered, shattering the silence.\n\n“I write horror stories. What did you expect?” \n\n“Fair point. Just let Sidney know we’re here so we can get this over with.”\n\n“I did. She should be coming out any-” \n\nThe door swung open, and Sidney marched up to our car with purpose. She scowled at us as we got out to greet her, icy blue eyes staring straight through me.\n\n“Uh, hey Sidney,” I mumbled sheepishly, avoiding eye contact.\n\n“You’re late.”\n\n“Yeah, maybe by like thirty seconds. You didn’t give us much notice,” Jake snapped. \n\n“Who is this? I told *you* to meet me. I didn’t say anything about Paul Bunyan over there.”\n\nJake opened his mouth to fire back, but I shook my head. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and kicked at the dirt. \n\n“He’s my brother. Sorry that I didn’t let you know he was coming. I’ll explain everything, but can we go inside? It’s freezing out here.”\n\n“Fine. You have *a lot* of explaining to do.” \n\nSidney gave Jake the once-over, looking him up and down, then reluctantly motioned for us to follow. \n\nOnce inside, we were met with a complete contrast to what we saw upon our arrival. An ornate chandelier shimmered above us, casting dancing rays of light upon a sleek wooden staircase. Its golden railing sparkled like it had just been cleaned prior to our arrival. \n\n“Come on. We can talk in here,” Sidney said, leading us into the living room.\n\nIt was just as beautiful as the foyer. Dated furniture and antiques adorned the room, instilling a sense of nostalgia for a time that I hadn’t been alive for. Ancient couches and lounge chairs lined the walls, complementing the room nicely. At the helm of it all stood a pristine fireplace, white bricks embellishing its exterior. Atop the mantel piece hung a large gloomy black and white photograph depicting a couple staring blankly into the camera. Their cold eyes and dour expressions sent a chill rippling through my body. \n\n“Well, are you just going to stand there, or are you going to take a seat?” Sidney grumbled, breaking me from my trance.\n\nI plopped down on the couch next to her. Jake opted for a lounge chair. \n\n“Beautiful house,” I murmured, still in shock at the utter paradox that was the house’s interior. \n\n“Yeah, I feel like I’m in the 1920’s,” Jake mused, earning him a disapproving glare from Sidney. \n\n“Okay, just get to the point. Why are you here, and how the hell did you know about the man on my balcony?”\n\nI relayed everything I knew. Sidney didn’t make a sound until I finished, listening intently to every word that fell from my lips. She was hesitant to believe me at first, but I pulled up my Reddit account on my phone, allowing her to read the story I’d written about her. Her eyes grew wide, and she covered her hand with her mouth.\n\n“I don’t need to read any more. Matt… *I* wrote that story. It’s in my diary in my room.”\n\n“But... that’s impossible… I mean, unless I’m, like, a vessel or something.”\n\nSidney opened her mouth to respond, but Jake interjected.\n\n“Okay, so it’s obvious that whatever magic crap that caused these things to come to life was also responsible for the story being an exact replica. We can figure out the details later. This creepy dude shows up at midnight, right?”\n\nSidney and I nodded in unison.\n\n“That means we only have twenty minutes to come up with a plan. Anyone have any bright ideas?”\n\nI turned to Sidney. \n\n“You have kitchen knives here, right?”\n\n“Um, duh.”\n\n“Awesome. You two grab a couple knives. Sid, he’s after you, so you’ll lure him in, while Jake and I will be waiting to ambush him. Simple enough?”\n\n“What, we’re going to stab him to death? What if he has his own knife?”\n\n“Well, that’s not exactly what I had in mind. The knives are just a precaution,” I grinned, flashing my hand cannon. \n\n“That works for me. Let me show you guys to my old room.”\n\nWe trailed behind Sidney, nervous apprehension bubbling inside me the whole way. She took us into the kitchen where she plucked two of the biggest knives from the knife block and handed one to Jake. We proceeded up the stairs, loud creaks emanating through the house after almost every other step. We rounded the corner to Sidney’s empty hot pink room, and I scanned our surroundings. I analyzed the grandiose glass doors leading to the balcony, fixating on their beauty until my gaze fell to the closet. \n\n“In there. That’s where I’ll hide. Jake, you wait outside the doorway until you hear something. And Sidney, you stand in the middle of the room and try to get him to come inside.”\n\n“Got it. I’m *really* not looking forward to seeing this sick creep again, but if this is what I have to do to rid myself of him, so be it.”\n\n“What do I do? Bust in there and slice him into ribbons when I hear a struggle?”\n\n“You’re just there for backup. In case he somehow overpowers both of us. But that won’t happen.” \n\nI glanced down at my phone. Ten minutes until midnight. \n\n“Matt, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just sit here in the dark and wait for this thing to show up?”\n\n“Yep, pretty much. We only have a few minutes left. Everyone take your places.”\n\nI slid into the closet, keeping it slightly ajar so that I still had a clear view of the balcony. Jake slipped out of the room, while Sidney sat with her legs criss-crossed on the floor. My eyes stayed glued to my phone’s lock screen as the seconds crawled past. \n\nNine minutes. Eight minutes. Seven minutes. Trepidation coursed through me like a tsunami. The palms of my hands started to sweat profusely as midnight grew closer and closer. Six minutes. Five minutes. Four minutes. My hands began to tremble, and my heart thumped violently against my ribcaged. Three minutes. Two minutes… Midnight.\n\nRight on cue, a dark emaciated figure appeared at the doors. Dark stringy hair fell past his shoulders. Filthy tattered clothing clung to his nauseatingly thin frame. His eyes lit up upon noticing Sidney. Those pinprick pupils sent a shiver up my spine. A wide manic grin plastered itself across his face, exposing black decaying gums and mouth full of broken rotting teeth. I gulped and readied my firearm.\n\n“Well, hello Sidney! Fancy seeing you here.”\n\n“W-what do you want from me?”\n\n“I just want you to let me in. I can keep you company. You know, now that your Mom is gone. Such a shame that I didn’t get to meet her in person.” \n\nSidney slammed her hands against the floor.\n\n“Don’t you dare talk about my mother, you worthless piece of shit.”\n\nHer fear had been replaced with animalistic rage. The man cackled uncontrollably like someone had just told him the world’s funniest knock-knock joke. \n\n“I mean it! Get in here *now*. I know you have a key.”\n\nThe man managed to compose himself, but his smile never faltered.\n\n“Well, if you insist.”\n\nHe produced a rusted ancient key from somewhere in his ragged pants and giddily unlocked the doors. He dramatically flung them open and stepped inside. \n\nSidney didn’t give him a second to react. She swiftly drew the knife from her belt and slashed at the man’s throat. He gurgled nonsense, dark viscous liquid bubbling from his mouth, as Sidney furiously bludgeoned his chest. I watched motionless from the closet as the light left his eyes. \n\nSidney didn’t stop. She stabbed the man ferociously again and again. I snapped myself from my stupor and anxiously approached her. \n\n“Uh, Sid. I think you got him. He looks pretty dead.”\n\nShe dropped the knife and turned to me. She was drenched in blood. Her whole outfit had been painted a deep crimson. But through all the bodily fluid, I could see tears flowing down her cheeks. She sobbed hysterically, her wails reverberating through the corridors. I rubbed her back and tried to calm her down the best I could. After a couple agonizing minutes, she wiped the tears from her face. We sat in silence, staring at the pockmarked body before us, until she finally spoke.\n\n“I know you were wondering why Mom isn’t here. I didn’t write it into the story because I just wasn’t ready to process it. Mom died a couple months ago. She had a brain aneurysm. I didn’t even get to say goodbye.”\n\nTears welled in her eyes as she told me that. My heart broke for her. \n\n“Sidney, I’m so sorry.”\n\nI hugged her tightly. She reciprocated, wrapping her shaking arms around my own quivering frame. I held her like that for a long time, relishing every second of her comforting embrace, until we both simultaneously let go. \n\n“I don’t know if you heard about it while we were in school, but I know your pain. My parents both died in a car accident a couple years back. Jake basically raised me for those last two years of high school. I have no idea what I’d do without him.”\n\n“Aw stop, you’re making me blush.”\n\nWe hadn’t even noticed Jake leaning against the doorway. \n\n“Not sure if you two love birds noticed or not, but slim creepy sorta liquified while you two were having your moment.”\n\n“Uh, we’re not. I mean, I’m not. Um it. I,” I stuttered helplessly as Sidney and I promptly sprang to our feet. \n\nHe was right. The man was gone, replaced with a pool of deep black liquid. \n\n“Jake and I can help you clean this up. Where do you keep the cleaning supplies?”\n\n“No, it’s okay I can get it. It’s late. You two should get some rest. Thank you, Matt.”\n\nShe flashed me a soft smile. I did the same.\n\n“Sorry for the mess. I’ll text you tomorrow.”\n\nJake and I turned to leave. We’d made it to the top of the stairs when Sidney called out to me.\n\n“Matt, wait! There’s more of these, um, monsters, right?” \n\n“Yeah. I wrote ten stories. We have nine left.” \n\n“Let me fight these things with you. Please.”\n\n“No, absolutely not. I can’t have you getting hurt because of me.”\n\n“Matt, please. I’m in this house all alone. I have no one left. The loneliness gets to you after a while… Also, you kinda owe me for writing me into this mess in the first place.”\n\nI wearily sighed. \n\n“You won’t take no for an answer, will you?”\n\nShe crossed her arms and shook her head.\n\n“Fine. Meet me tomorrow at my house. I’ll text you the time and address. I hope you’re not afraid of clowns.”",

        "text": "The night was still and the shadows grew deep. The wind whispered secrets and the trees bowed in sleep. The moonlight shone down from the sky so high, illuminating the night sky's darkness.\n\nI was alone in the streets, the only one around. I heard voices in the shadows, calling my name. I wanted to turn around and run, but something kept me rooted.\n\nI followed the voices, my heart pounding in my chest. I came to the edge of the forest, and I stopped dead in my tracks. What I saw there made my blood run cold.\n\nA figure in a long black cloak stood in front of me. Their face was hidden in the darkness, and their eyes glowed red. I couldn’t speak or move, and all I could do was stare.\n\nThe figure stepped forward, and in a voice that chilled my bones, said, “Come with me, and I will show you the truth.” I didn’t know what to do, but something compelled me to follow.\n\nWe walked for what felt like hours until we came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a large stone altar.\n\nThe figure motioned for me to come closer and I stepped forward. They placed their hands on the altar and began to chant in a strange language. I felt a chill go up my spine and I backed away.\n\nThe figure looked up at me and said, “Do not be afraid. I have something to show you.” I stepped closer, and the figure moved their hands over the altar.\n\nSuddenly, the altar glowed and images began to appear. I saw a man standing before a crowd of people, his eyes closed in concentration. I saw a woman in a dark alley, her hands trembling as she held a gun. I saw a group of children playing in an open field, laughing and running around.\n\nThe figure spoke again, “These are the stories that have been lost, forgotten in the shadows of time. I have been sent to bring them back.”\n\nThe figure turned to me and said, “Will you help me bring these stories back to life?” I nodded, still unsure of what I was getting myself into. The figure smiled and said, “Good. Now let us begin.”\n\nI followed the figure as they began to tell the stories. I listened intently as they spoke of love and loss, courage and fear, and hope and despair. I was captivated by the power of each tale, and I found myself caught up in their emotion.\n\nWe continued walking, and soon we reached the edge of the forest. The figure turned to me and said, “It is time for you to go now. I have given you the stories, and it is up to you to bring them to life.”\n\nI thanked the figure for the stories and began to walk away. As I left, I heard the figure whisper, “Good luck, and may your stories live on forever.”\n\nI returned home, my head filled with stories of the past. I wrote them down, each word a piece of a puzzle that I was slowly piecing together. I knew that I had to share these stories with the world, so I posted them on a website called r/nosleep.\n\nAnd so, the stories I had been told, the stories of love and loss, courage and fear, and hope and despair, were shared with the world. And they will live on.\n\nAs the stories were shared, they began to take on a life of their own. People from all around the world began to share their versions of these tales. Some were happy, some were sad, some were scary, and some were inspiring.\n\nBut no matter the story, they all had one thing in common: they were all tales of hope. Hope that one day, these stories would inspire someone to make a change, to make the world a better place.\n\nAnd as time passed, these stories began to have an impact. People began to come together and share their stories, to help one another, to stand up against injustice, and to create a better future for themselves and those around them.\n\nAnd so, these stories, these tales of hope, have been shared and have spread across the world, inspiring people and giving them the courage to make a difference. And this, my friends, is the power of stories.",

        "text": "Well, I live in a very small town called Cidade da Lucky. This name doesn't make sense because luck is what we have the least here, the city is very small and is famous for its brutal crimes.\n\nJust yesterday 10 children were killed in a nursery by a teacher. murders and suicides are very common around here. I was born and raised in this town so I'm pretty used to the goings-on, I'm currently 16 years old and I live with my mom and dad.\n\nYou must be wondering why we don't leave this place, we just can't, we tried to leave but whenever we pass a certain point our car breaks down and we have to go back to the city.\n\nAnd as if something doesn't want people to leave the city, that is, when you enter the city there is no way out. There are also other strange things around here, for example when I'm going to school I always see an old man crying in the backyard of a home in a rocking chair, every day he is there in the same place rocking and crying as if he is sorry for something.\n\nThe house he lives in is very old and the paint is peeling and the wall of the house is covered in mold, and it is very scary to go there. I forgot to tell you a detail, the city is always cloudy and rainy, a very depressing, it's rare the times where I feel the heat of the sun.\n\nCity dwellers also report a shadow on top of buildings at night as if they were watching the city. One day I decided to ask that old man why he was crying because I was tired of seeing that old man crying every day, so when I was returning from school I asked :''hey are you ok?'' and he replied:''i'm not ok it's all my fault.''I said I wanted to come in and talk to him but he told me to go away but I insisted so he opened the gate and let me in.\n\nhe told me to come in the house i went in and the house was run down with a musty smell it felt like the ceiling was going to fall in at any moment i sat on his couch and ripped he sat on the other couch there i started talking to him.\n\nHis face was sore you could see his dark circles from crying and his sad expression. I asked him why he was crying and he told me everything. His name was Joe When he was young, legends circulated of a supposed woman in the forest who granted wishes in return that year he smoked a lot then he had developed lung cancer, it was already in a very advanced state and he knew he was going to die so he went after this supposed legend.\n\nHe went into the woods and found a wooden hut he approached and there was an old woman sitting on a wooden chair she asked him if he needed any wishes to be granted he said he wanted to cure cancer she asked what he would give in return and he said he had nothing to give so she said she would take something of her own.\n\nShe put her hand on his forehead and said some strange phrases after that he woke up at the exit of the forest he could hear some laughter coming from the forest it was probably that woman. He was feeling totally healed so it worked the legend was real, he went back to his home and continued his life normally the next day the murder cases began, now the spirit of that witch surrounds the city at night observing the disgrace that she herself caused.\n\nHe ended by saying ''that damn witch why did I trust her now we're all trapped in this town being forced to live with this terrible curse.''\n\nI left his house wondering if I should really believe him, but I think he's right, this town is not normal. I went back to my house and decided to write this. never pass through this town unless you want to be stuck here.",

        "text": "Before I even start this story, let me just say that I *know* I made some dumb choices. You don’t need to tell me. This is your disclaimer that I know they were stupid and I’m going to write about them anyway, so just know what you’re walking into.\n\nNow that the PSA is out of the way, let’s dig in.\n\nIt had been nearing a [month](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100d7js/eyes_of_coal_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) since I’d been farther from the bar than the patio out back. I was going stir crazy. Like, seriously, between Henri’s continued attempts to shield me from the details of the murders (still ongoing), the increased crowds filling the bar due to said murders, and some old favorites like Eira and Pax showing up over the holidays, I *needed* to get some space.\n\nI begged Henri to let me run an errand or two, just the simple ones. I promised I’d bring Sgrios and drag Milo along. I swore up and down that I’d be extra, extra careful. \n\nUnfortunately, Henri saw right through all these promises, and he only kept a closer eye on me than usual. And I remained confined to Griffin’s Edge.\n\nEnter the stupid choices I mentioned. \n\nIt was two days ago. The last murder had been a few days prior; things had been quiet in the world of supernatural crime since. In contrast, things had *not* been quiet at the bar. Fear was good for business, enough that Henri had hired a few extra part-time workers to keep up with the constantly-full bar. So many selkies, fairies, werewolves, and elves were packed into the space from open to close that it felt like a One Direction concert in 2012. (Yeah, I know *some* pop culture). \n\nIt was driving me mad. Even when I escaped to my room, I could hear the crowds. It was impossible not to. Groups of dwarves and pixies aren’t chill on their best days, and this sure as hell wasn’t anyone’s best day. So even when I wasn’t working, the shouting and clinking of glasses was unavoidable.\n\nAnd that’s why, after what felt like the hundredth attempt to convince Henri to let me leave—just as much a failure as the first ninety-nine—I made up my mind to do it anyway.\n\nHold your comments. Like I said, in hindsight, it was stupid. I *know* that. Actually, not even in hindsight. I knew it was stupid at the time, too. I just didn’t care.\n\nYou probably remember how I talked about some of our holiday visitors. Eira and Pax sure aren’t easy to forget. Luckily, after New Year’s, most of them return to hibernation for another eleven months. \n\nNot all of them, though. Some are *winter* creatures, not holiday creatures. And of course, plenty of them aren’t particularly nice. I probably should have thought about the fact that it’s still January when I decided to venture out.\n\nAs it was, I didn’t. Or at least, not as much as I should’ve. Instead, when a cluster of goblins in the corner mentioned how much they’d kill for some deep-dish pizza, I looked around to make sure that Henri wasn’t within earshot, and then I quickly volunteered to go.\n\n*Back in half an hour,* I promised. *Just don’t tell anyone where I’ve gone. If Henri asks, say I went into the storage room to get more crackers.*\n\nGoblins, unfortunately, aren’t the most morally conscious. So they made zero effort to tell me this was a bad idea. They cackled and said they’d tip well if I got extra cheese on the pizza.\n\nI snuck out easily; the crowds were so dense that you could barely see the closest table, let alone across the room. Only the goblins knew where I was going. I didn’t even tell Milo, who was one of our extra part-time hires, because he’s been nervous enough that I knew he’d try to keep me from going. He might even be worried enough to tell Henri, and I couldn’t risk that. Then his piercing lilac eyes would *really* never leave me be.\n\nI made it to Chicago with no issues. Sure, there were some sketchy dudes in the alley I popped up in, but I sprinted away from there quickly enough that they barely realized I’d appeared at all.\n\nI even got the pizza with no issues. But the fact that I’m writing about my bad choices probably cues you in to the fact that something went wrong. And yeah, you’d be right. Because my atoms can’t get their shit together, and so right as I left the restaurant, pizza in one hand, I jumped.\n\nHonestly, I don’t even know what did it this time. Which was pretty obnoxious. I didn’t sneeze or cough or anything. Maybe it was just a shiver in the breeze. No clue. Either way, more sensitive than it used to be. Not my favorite sign.\n\nIn *good* news, for the first time in what feels like forever, I didn’t jump to the dark forests of Neverland. I mean, it was still *close—*I jumped to a snowy plain just north of those lovely forests. But still better than usual.\n\nIn fact, as cold wind blew a flurry of snowflakes into my face, I squinted at the blur of dark, twisted trees in the distance and breathed a sigh of relief. I was only wearing my long-sleeved Griffin’s Edge shirt, so I was freezing. Only my left hand, spread against the hot pizza box, was warm. “Still better than being over there,” I told myself with another glance at the nearby forest.\n\nAnother gust of biting wind made me shiver violently. “Only a little better,” I corrected with gritted teeth. “Screw this.” \n\nI began to feel for a gap to pass through, barely able to see my hand reaching out through the blustery snowflakes. But I didn’t have time to find anything before mischievous laughter filled the air around me. My heart sank and I tried to focus harder. I was pretty sure I knew who was here, and I didn’t want to stick around for a heart-to-heart.\n\nThe wind worsened, whistling around me so that I could barely hear the echoing laughter over its noise. My hair whipped my cheeks—guess that was a sign I needed a haircut—and my fingers were beginning to grow numb. And still, I couldn’t find a gap.\n\nI cursed under my breath. I was pretty sure he was blocking any nearby tears in reality. And of course, when it would actually be *helpful* to jump, my body has no interest. \n\nWhich is how I ended up still standing there like an idiot, holding a rapidly-cooling pizza, as the wind and snow became a swirling blizzard around me. I squeezed my eyes shut and grabbed my knife from my belt with my free hand, because I had a sneaking suspicion I wasn’t going to like where I ended up.\n\nSure enough, the blizzard cleared after thirty seconds or so, and I suddenly realized that I was no longer cold, and that it had become completely silent. I cursed at myself mentally and opened my eyes.\n\nI was in a large, round room with a domed roof. The walls seemed to be made of thick ice blocks, like an igloo, though several torches and a fireplace burned warmly with no melting. A sort of living room area was arranged by the fireplace, with couches and a plush pastel blue rug. \n\nFrom behind me came a voice—a child’s voice. “I found you out in the snow. I saved you.”\n\nMy heart sank all over again as I turned around. The other side of the igloo consisted of a small kitchen and a bedroom area, complete with a set of bunk beds carved from ice. And on the top bunk, legs dangling over the side, was a kid: a kid about ten years old, with shaggy white hair and steely blue eyes. \n\nOnly it wasn’t *just* a kid. They were the reason I’d been nervous as soon as the laughter began. I’d never met them, but I’d heard plenty from Henri and from the legends they’d inspired. I knew that they always appeared as a child, sometimes a little boy, sometimes a girl, sometimes in-between. But always about ten years old with white hair. And despite their innocent appearance, they were anything but; no, Jacian was an immortal, winter spirit who was, at best, mischievous, and at worst, murderous. \n\nAnd yeah, you guessed it: the inspiration for the many, many versions of Jack Frost.\n\nI should have known as soon as I found myself in an icy plain. It was still January, for God’s sake. Jacian would be awake and all too happy to take advantage of a dumbass who showed up in their territory.\n\nStill, as with all beings—especially potentially dangerous ones—best to start off being polite. So I swallowed my fear and gave Jacian a tentative smile. “That was very kind of you. Thank you for bringing me into your home.” I made a big show of spinning around and taking in the room. “It’s lovely.”\n\nJacian giggled. “I know. Everyone likes it.”\n\nI gave a nervous laugh, tightening my grip on Sgrios. “They’d be idiots not to.”\n\nJacian jumped down off the bunk bed, landing lightly with no sound. I realized as they crossed the icy floor that they were barefoot, each step as silent and muffled as if they’d been walking on carpet. They approached me, looking curious. “You’re not combusting.”\n\nBest to play dumb. “What?”\n\nJacian slunk around me in a circle. They were short with pointy ears, a little pixie of a kid. And yet, I could sense the power they wielded: an aura of immortality and strength beyond their age. Spending a lot of time around powerful beings kind of cues you into the energy they give off. It’s hard to explain, but trust me, it’s a distinct vibe. Growing up around Henri and Griffin’s Edge has made me good at recognizing it.\n\n“You look human,” they mused. “But you’re very stable here. That’s interesting.” They were looking me up and down, examining me in a hungry way that I didn’t particularly enjoy. “I haven’t seen that before.”\n\nMy skin crawled at the look in their eyes, and I hoped my discomfort wasn’t apparent as I tried to nonchalantly shrug. “Really? Huh.”\n\nSuddenly Jacian was in my face, pale blue eyes burning with anger. “Don’t you lie to me,” they spit out. The air around me seemed to drop twenty degrees; immediately, my teeth began to chatter. “Don’t you *dare* disrespect me like that.”\n\nThey backed off as quickly as they’d riled up, standing a few feet away from me. They tilted their head like a curious puppy as my heart continued to pound in my chest. “You know who I am, don’t you?”\n\nWell, playing dumb wasn’t working. Time for Plan B: flattery. “I do,” I said carefully. “I’ve heard incredible things about you. I’ve also heard how much you like to play games. So maybe…we could play Go Fish or something, and then I could be on my way?”\n\nJacian didn’t move. “I do like games.”\n\n“I’m sure you must be lonely here,” I pressed. \n\nWell, *that* was a mistake. Jacian giggled and took a step closer, their expression changing into something unreadable but also highly, highly concerning. A chill ran down my spine. “I’m quite lonely,” they said innocently. “But with loneliness also comes…hunger.” \n\nOh no. Damn it. This is what I’d been afraid of. I smiled tentatively and held up the now-cold pizza in my non-knife hand. “Luckily, I have a pizza,” I said helpfully. “You like extra cheese?”\n\nAnother step closer. I took a step back, feeling my heels brush the edge of the rug. Jacian smiled, revealing that their teeth had sharpened to points. *Shit.* “You and I both know that’s not what I eat.”\n\nOh, I did know. I was completely aware that Jacian liked to eat people. Supposedly, their favorite was to lure unsuspecting victims into rigged games, and then eat them when they inevitably lost. In this case, I guess they were hungry enough that they wanted to skip ahead to the eating part.\n\nI cursed the mysterious murderer in my head. Probably Jacian had experienced an even hungrier winter than usual, since half of Neverland’s population had taken up part-time residency in our bar. And now I’d wandered right into their open arms.\n\nI looked around frantically for an escape route. I’m sure you’ll be shocked to hear that this igloo *had no doors.* I guess when your guests enter via blizzard and exit via death, you don’t need one. \n\nMy thoughts had turned into a continuous string of curse words intermixed with increasingly-desperate ideas for getting away. I only had my knife and a pizza, and Jacian was immortal; Sgrios wouldn’t help, and I’d already offered the pizza. No doors. Jacian was blocking escape via traveling through a gap in reality—I’d felt the heaviness, the stiffness of the fabric when I’d tried to find an opening again. And there were definitely no other beings nearby to save me.\n\nWhich left only one option, something only I could do that might just save me for once: jumping.\n\nJacian was still advancing, and I was still backing up across the rug, though my back was almost to the fireplace, and I’d have nowhere else to go. I kept my eyes on Jacian, knuckles white around Sgrios, as I discretely tried to look around for anything that would help me sneeze or cough.\n\nMy back was against the wall when my gaze came to rest on the fluffy rug beneath my feet. Jacian saw me glance down, and their pointed smile widened. “You like my décor? Don’t worry. Blood washes out of it easily.”\n\n“What a relief,” I said. And then, before I could doubt the stupidness of this idea, I dropped to my knees, shoved my face into the rug, and inhaled as hard as I could. \n\nNothing. Jacian was only a few steps away; I saw their bare feet on the rug, starkly pale against the blue. They giggled maniacally. “You’re funny,” they said, sounding amused. “If I wasn’t so hungry, maybe I’d keep you around.”\n\n“I’m flattered,” I said, voice muffled by the rug. My heart was threatening to leap out of my chest. If Jacian got close enough to grab me, it’d be over. I’d die on my knees sniffing some immortal being’s rug. What a ridiculous way to go. I’d never live this down in whatever afterlife I went to.\n\n*Come on, come on.* All those unintentional jumps, and now my atoms couldn’t do it *once* when I wanted them to! *Atoms, if you don’t do your thing right now, you’re going to exist in an immortal kid’s stomach instead and you’ll never get to take us to the dark forests again! Come on, come* on—\n\nJacian was reaching out, wind was beginning to whip around us, and my blood was running cold as ice as I inhaled again, so deeply that I swear I swallowed rug fibers and also apparently breathed some into my nose, because suddenly I sneezed violently.\n\nAnd promptly found myself on my knees in a church. \n\nYeah, that’s right, a human church. I can appreciate the humor in me jumping from an otherworldly dimension straight into a place of human worship. At the time, though, I just felt relief. Warmth and so much relief. I was sure Jacian was fuming back in their igloo, and I’d never been happier to picture a child crying.\n\nLuckily, it was a Thursday afternoon, so the church was empty. I feel like sitting in a church service immediately after almost being eaten wouldn’t have been super comforting. \n\nI slowly got to my feet in the aisle between pews. I was still holding the pizza; I realized I’d never dropped it, even in the face of death. If anyone deserves a five-star rating and a good tip, I think it’s me.\n\nI was about to leave the church and look for a gap somewhere outside—I don’t know, it just felt weird to do it in the church itself, like it was kind of disrespectful somehow—when a strong coppery smell caught my attention. For like the fifth time in the last hour, my heart sank. I knew that smell. I’d served it to vampires at the bar; I’d smelled it when Milo and I had found the dwarf’s corpse. Blood. A *lot* of blood.\n\nI set the pizza down on one of the pews and looked around for the source. *There.* Behind the altar, I saw a glint of red as a pool of blood spread across the wood. This couldn’t be good. \n\n“How do I always get unlucky enough to find the bodies,” I muttered to myself as I reluctantly moved towards the altar. “Why is it always me? Human world, Neverland, doesn’t matter. Just let Ian find all the bodies. That won’t lead to lasting emotional trauma or anything.”\n\nI rounded the corner and gasped. Sure, I’ve seen more death than most people probably have, but it never gets easier. Especially because this was just a poor human priest, still wearing his robes, who by the looks of it had been murdered on his own altar. I counted three bullet holes in his forehead and chest, as well as several long cuts across his torso. Someone had really had it out for this priest.\n\nI crouched at his side, being careful to keep my shoes out of the growing pool of blood. “Murderers are just everywhere lately, huh?” I whispered to the corpse. “The world’s really going to hell.”\n\nMy plan was to call 911 anonymously and then bail. I’m no expert in human law enforcement or anything, but I know the basics. And the good thing about crimes in the human dimension is, they’re more equipped to respond to them. Of course, that’s a product of them being more common than in Neverland, but hey, at least there’s a silver lining.\n\nCalling 911 with the church phone was, I figured, the most I could do to help. Then the cops could handle it from there and find whatever asshole had done this. That was my *plan,* at least—but that’s when I noticed something sticking out of his closed fist: something black and oddly familiar. \n\n“Sorry for this,” I whispered to the priest as I leaned over and gently tugged it out of his hand. It was a napkin, a neat black square, and as I let it fall open in my hands, I felt my blood run even colder than it had in Jacian’s igloo. It was a Griffin’s Edge napkin, complete with the lilac embroidery of our logo. And as I looked between it and the priest’s face, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he hadn’t been to visit us in the last month. I mean, I’ve been there 24/7 that entire time, and I’m good with faces. This priest hadn’t been to the bar recently…so why did he have one of our napkins?\n\nNow, I know you’re probably thinking, couldn’t he have it had from earlier? Sure, I guess. But like I said, I’m good with faces, and I didn’t recognize him at all. Priests also tend to get noticed when they visit us and cause significant drama—I mean, vampires and the like aren’t their biggest fans. Kind of a historical grudge at this point. And I didn’t remember any recent discussions involving priests. So I was pretty sure he’d never been to [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/).\n\nLong story short, I still called 911 and told them about the body. But when I left after, cold pizza in one hand, I took the napkin too, stuffed in my pocket. The police didn’t need to find that. I still wasn’t sure what it meant myself, but the last thing we needed was cops figuring out how to visit us and investigating the bar, especially with it being so crowded already.\n\nAll in all, I hadn’t actually been gone very long—about an hour. Somehow, I managed to sneak in unnoticed, though when I dropped off the pizza at the goblins’ table, they opened it to find a thin layer of ice covering all that extra cheese. Needless to say, I didn’t get a tip, even after trying to explain how impressive it was that I’d held onto the pizza at all through multiple dimension jumps and almost getting eaten. They weren’t appropriately impressed.\n\nHenri had been occupied with the latest swarms of guests, although I felt his piercing eyes on me as I worked the rest of the night with less enthusiasm than usual. The napkin was still in my pocket, and I’ll be honest: it was still there even when I took off my jeans and went to bed that night. Hell, it’s still there now. It’s been two days and I just keep thinking about that damn napkin.\n\nIt might mean nothing. Maybe my memory just isn’t as good as I think it is. Or maybe I lost too many brain cells from rug-sniffing to see something obvious. But I can’t shake the feeling that I should tell Henri, or the fear that this might mean that the priest’s murderer *has* been here, even if the priest hasn’t. I’ve been replaying the faces of patrons in my head like a highlight reel, desperately trying to recall anyone who acted like a murderer. But there’s not really any standouts when half our guests literally drink blood or eat flesh to survive.\n\nI don’t know. I think I’ve got to tell Uncle Henri about it, though. If anyone will have better ideas than me, it’s him. \n\nUnfortunately, that also means telling him about my latest unauthorized venture and near-death experience, which is going to earn me one hell of a disappointed stare. Ah, well. I guess it’s still better than being eaten by a creepy immortal kid in an igloo.",

        "text": "I get like this every year, when the leaves fall. Maybe this year the fall won't come, I say to myself. But sure enough, it comes. Drawn out summer or quick and hot, the leaves still fall.\n\nI say, you don't bother me leaves, I know your game. You fall, and you rot, and go away into nothing, all the while smelling so sweet.\n\nI've always thought it strange, how sweet they smell as they lie there, rotting.\n\nThe rows of trees turn scarlet and tangerine, and they shed themselves like embers falling through the shutters of a fireplace, and I can't bare to look, not for too long. Underneath children's feet the dry leaves crumble, and they cry and laugh and how I wish they would all go home and stay inside, because it always makes me think of you.\n\nWe would walk together along the street, I would probably be saying some inane bullshit, and you, probably not paying attention, would nod or utter some noncommittal grunt. I didn't ever mind that much, you were there with me all the same.\n\nIf we were lucky we might fall in sync, and look around, then you might say something we could feel at the same time, like \"Isn't it pretty here, when all the leaves begin to fall?\" And we would stand together and watch them softly saunter down to land on the ground, in the dirt.\n\nNow I tap the ashes from a cigarette and they fall down too, breaking on the bow of my windowsill. Then the broken flecks float across the sky and drift away to rest upon the street and the rotting leaves.\n\nMaybe you were sat outside, on some quiet night, and I was stood a little way away. And after a minute or two had passed in the quiet, you would ask me if I needed the lighter again. Then I suppose I said yes, thanks, and returned the lighter, and to my mood, and the quiet.\n\nAnd in amongst that unpresent flurry, the evening you didn’t come back. Distinctly, I recall in me the feeling of annoyance rise, which grew to anger and then dulled and softened to anxious blooms. And, when I found out you weren’t coming back I did nothing but watch the leaves on my own, because I could not.\n\nNow there is no one but me to break the silence. So I wheeze and cough, and play the music that you probably wouldn't like, because I can.\n\nBut, when the autumn comes around again, and I stare too long at the fluttering leaves, I hear you, your noncommittal grunts, feel your now-cold hands slip back into mine. And, if I hold my gaze just right, tilting my head a little, I can make out the arcs of your arm, drawn next to mine, spectral and thin. And, if by chance we’ve fallen in sync, I’ll hear you say something that we can feel together, like “aren’t they pretty when they fall”.",

        "text": "Most of us have no way to comprehend the depths of physical pain that a person can endure. I’ve struggled and failed to understand the evolutionary or theological reasoning behind it. If you’ve never felt your body suffering at its absolute maximum, [I have no way of articulating what it was like to shove an ice pick through my own eye](https://redd.it/105n5zr). \n\nThrough the shaking, the hurt, the *desecration* of my body, I remember one clear thought filtering through:\n\nI would have sacrificed my mother, my children, anyone I’d ever loved, to end the white-hot horror burning through my face. If a gun were pointed at my head, I would have pulled the trigger without a second thought. \n\nIf you believe that you wouldn’t offer the same concessions to Satan, you don’t understand yourself. \n\nI have no idea how long I screamed. After a certain point, I couldn’t remember anything from my life other than burning and agony. Eventually, I exhausted myself so thoroughly that I could only slump in the chair. The ice pick, wedged deeply in my eye socket, finally had the opportunity to slough through my head gristle. With a sound uncannily akin to strawberry jam squishing through infected toes, the tool dripped from my face with molasses-like slowness. I was too exhausted to react as it finally broke free from my sticky, coagulating blood and fell to the floor with all the grace and glory of an elephant’s bowel movement.\n\nI didn’t have the strength to resist Dirty Santa as he stuffed gauze into my open wound before liberally applying medical tape. “Good thing you missed your blood vessels!” he croaked. “It’s only eye goop spilling down your face.” He pressed against my side as he worked. His erection was prominent.\n\nSanta clapped his hands. “Oh *boy*, that was a FUN present. But now it’s time to play with the… GAS-O-LEEN!” he yelled while dancing.\n\n“I’d like to switch,” Jerry gurgled.\n\nSanta tapped his grimy beard with a fat finger. “HMMM. You picked it, so you can’t trade unless someone *else* wants your toy. I can allow that, but only if one of your little friendsies is willing to swap their choice!”\n\nMy lone remaining eye was too exhausted to close. I watched him look pleadingly at the blonde woman and college girl.\n\n“Come on… yours might be worse,” he squeaked. \n\n“I’ll take my chances,” the blonde woman deadpanned. “I’m so sorry, but you’re stuck with the gasoline.”\n\nJerry wept. His sobs grew louder as Dirty Santa lifted the gasoline can and poured it over his flabby body. He took great care to rub it into Jerry’s ears, hair, and neck, using an almost loving touch as he made sure that every part of him would burn.\n\nPrior to the ice pick, I would have been telling myself that this couldn’t happen. That the universe simply didn’t have the capacity to cause such great damage to one gentle soul.\n\nOf course, that was before I’d been forced to pluck out my own eye. Now I understood that the world was composed of the kind of hopelessness that diminishes the specter of death. \n\nJerry was crying openly as Santa shook the last of the gas can over his crotch. “Why are you doing this?” he wailed. \n\nDirty Santa leaned close to his ear and smiled.\n\n“Because.”\n\nThen he scooped the lighter from the floor and flashed a bright smile. “Any last thoughts you’d like to share while you still have lips?”\n\n“You could stop this now,” Jerry sobbed, “and it would be the best thing in my whole damn life.”\n\nDirty Santa turned his head to the side. “But I won’t.”\n\nHe flicked the lighter and dropped the flame.\n\nThe heat was so powerful that it was the only physical sensation I could feel through the eye pain. A few seconds later, though, Jerry’s screams hurt my ears badly enough that physical agony was attacking me in three different places.\n\nIt could have been nineteen minutes or thirteen seconds. Time lost all meaning as I listened to my friend scream until his cheeks and throat had dissolved too thoroughly to be loud. \n\nI knew that it was over when I heard the *thunk* of Jerry hitting the floor. I realized, in a distant sort of way, that it mean the fire had finally burned through his bonds. \n\nFor a moment, everything was still.\n\nThen a heavy, wet sack hit my thighs. I struggled to make sense of what my eye was seeing.\n\nHave you ever observed a man without skin? The sight will creep into your head and take up residence, gluing to your memory as so much fried chicken-like gristle sticking to the inside of your greasy skull. \n\n“Please kill me,” the bone-and-sinew creature begged as he placed the ice pick in my hand.\n\nWhat would you have done for a friend?\n\nWe all have our “limits.” Those are the boundaries we tell ourselves we can’t cross, because it gives the illusion of control. The reality is that every one of us is just a few steps away from racing across a line that we foolishly believed is out of reach.\n\nI couldn’t reach very far with my bound wrists, so it was a messy affair. But once I got between his ribs, it was like putting a toothpick through cold Jell-O.\n\nHe died in my lap. His body stayed there. \n\nI didn’t have the energy to slide him to the floor. \n\nThe body twitched a lot. \n\n“O-Kay-Doh-Kay!” Dirty Santa called. He danced a little jig. “Two presents left, and two people to share them!” He looked at the college girl. “You’re next! I’m not gonna lie, my favorite present hasn’t even been picked yet!”\n\n--------------\n\nThat’s enough for now. I think my therapist is full of shit: the more I talk about it, the worse I feel. I don’t know if I’ll be able to exorcise this particular demon. \n\nI’ve taken four Valium, but it’s not enough. To be perfectly honest, the thought of an overdose just doesn’t scare me. \n\nI’ll finish the story if I wake up. \n\n--------------\n\n[FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": "Well, I live in a very small town called Cidade da Lucky. This name doesn't make sense because luck is what we have the least here, the city is very small and is famous for its brutal crimes.\n\nJust yesterday 10 children were killed in a nursery by a teacher. murders and suicides are very common around here. I was born and raised in this town so I'm pretty used to the goings-on, I'm currently 16 years old and I live with my mom and dad.\n\nYou must be wondering why we don't leave this place, we just can't, we tried to leave but whenever we pass a certain point our car breaks down and we have to go back to the city.\n\nAnd as if something doesn't want people to leave the city, that is, when you enter the city there is no way out. There are also other strange things around here, for example when I'm going to school I always see an old man crying in the backyard of a home in a rocking chair, every day he is there in the same place rocking and crying as if he is sorry for something.\n\nThe house he lives in is very old and the paint is peeling and the wall of the house is covered in mold, and it is very scary to go there. I forgot to tell you a detail, the city is always cloudy and rainy, a very depressing, it's rare the times where I feel the heat of the sun.\n\nCity dwellers also report a shadow on top of buildings at night as if they were watching the city. One day I decided to ask that old man why he was crying because I was tired of seeing that old man crying every day, so when I was returning from school I asked :''hey are you ok?'' and he replied:''i'm not ok it's all my fault.''I said I wanted to come in and talk to him but he told me to go away but I insisted so he opened the gate and let me in.\n\nhe told me to come in the house i went in and the house was run down with a musty smell it felt like the ceiling was going to fall in at any moment i sat on his couch and ripped he sat on the other couch there i started talking to him.\n\nHis face was sore you could see his dark circles from crying and his sad expression. I asked him why he was crying and he told me everything. His name was Joe When he was young, legends circulated of a supposed woman in the forest who granted wishes in return that year he smoked a lot then he had developed lung cancer, it was already in a very advanced state and he knew he was going to die so he went after this supposed legend.\n\nHe went into the woods and found a wooden hut he approached and there was an old woman sitting on a wooden chair she asked him if he needed any wishes to be granted he said he wanted to cure cancer she asked what he would give in return and he said he had nothing to give so she said she would take something of her own.\n\nShe put her hand on his forehead and said some strange phrases after that he woke up at the exit of the forest he could hear some laughter coming from the forest it was probably that woman. He was feeling totally healed so it worked the legend was real, he went back to his home and continued his life normally the next day the murder cases began, now the spirit of that witch surrounds the city at night observing the disgrace that she herself caused.\n\nHe ended by saying ''that damn witch why did I trust her now we're all trapped in this town being forced to live with this terrible curse.''\n\nI left his house wondering if I should really believe him, but I think he's right, this town is not normal. I went back to my house and decided to write this. never pass through this town unless you want to be stuck here.",

        "text": "I met Alice on one of my business trips to California, she was just something else. She was a woman whose spirit could befriend you before you could ever go to her beauty, but even so, she was dead-drop gorgeous. She was kind, and somehow when I spent my time with her, I felt free, like something was holding me, and she was the only one who could free me.\n\nNot only that, but she was always keen to do new things, and nothing stopped her. Even when she was afraid, she never showed it and smiled and did whatever had to be done. I remember how I was afraid of skydiving and was against it, but she somehow managed to make me agree, and we even ended up doing it together. She was just something else…she always said that *the life we live is short, so stop doubting yourself and start living…*\n\nThat was then and now, I am writing this from my own basement where I locked myself till my wife's best mother arrives so that at least someone can believe what I am going through. My wife is still weeping in the room where I locked her before she tries to escape and kill me…again. I can hear her screams and bang, but I am too afraid.\n\nIt all started with that damn party, I don't clearly remember, but I will try to detail whatever happened before and after that party. So last year, my wife was invited to a party her boss hosted at her house.\n\nMy wife is a writer, and she works for a magazine, but her skill set is rather wide, she is a photographer, editor artist, and a bright chef, so I was always proud of her. She was a famous figure in the whole office after Lisa (her boss) so she was supposed to be the life of the party.\n\n(Also, I would like to clarify we were married for 7 years, and we never fought, seriously and just had a perfect understanding, and she used to look at me with teddy eyes whenever I was angry or frustrated. I used to forget whatever I felt just by looking at her. I just loved her. Somehow I still do…)\n\nWe went to the party and everyone greeted her, everyone had respect or admiration in their eyes whenever they saw Alice, so I was happy for her. She went to greet the boss while I was supposed to go to the restroom when I heard glass shatter, which was not supposed to be a big deal, but then I heard a kid crying and heard Alice's voice. I went down to see what happened, the glass pieces were on Alice's hand and blood was running down, but the kid panicked and started crying, Alice was still hugging him calming him down.\n\nI rushed down to Alice, and we left early from the party to get her to the hospital, the cut wasn't too deep and after a proper wrapping from the doctor we were on our way home. I was still thinking about her kindness and her expression calming the kid and looking at me and smiling while shrugging, I kissed her when we got home.\n\nWe took things to bed pretty soon and were sleeping after a few hours when I heard someone weeping I woke up and saw that Alice wasn't there, so I went downstairs in a hurry to see where she was when I saw her looking from the window towards the moon. The moonlight falling on her made her look…pale immediately like she didn't have blood running in her.\n\nI went to her and hugged her from behind, calling her name out, but even her eyes were white. Her iris was…not there I immediately took a step back and pulled her from the moonlight and there suddenly her skin became lively again and her iris came back and her tears stopped. She was thirsty so I gave her water but she still wasn't able to speak for a few minutes so we sat down she slept in my arms so I slept on the sofa too.\n\nThe next day was normal and I didn't focus too much on the previous night and Alice too was smiling again and was normal so we went to work as usual and returned in the evening nothing strange then too so we took dinner and went to sleep.\n\nIt was cloudy that day as I checked before hitting the bed but once again at 2:09 I heard a child weeping we didn't have a child yet so I was surprised my wife was missing from the bed so I went downstairs. Alice was again looking at the sky from our window and moonlight was falling on her, her skin white as ice and no iris in her eyes but this time she was hugging herself and was crying watching the moon.\n\nI called her out but she didn't hear, I tried pulling but she didn't move an inch. It was almost like she became a statue there. Now I am a regular reader here on r/nosleep so I was well aware of things that could happen. So I sat on my sofa to observe before taking any actions. I sat there in utter silence just the moonlight falling from a window and my wife weeping...\n\nShe cried till 3 and just sat there against the wall her head between her knees and elbows crossed. She stopped weeping now so I approached her to enquire her of her sudden actions but when I touched her she was burning, not like someone with fever, but she was literally burning.\n\nI could see her pale skin vibrating...it was her blood boiling but after touching her, she looked up this time her eyes were full black like the iris took the whole space and her pale skin was somewhat a little reddish, she broke the vas near her and started to stab the window with the glass. I was confused at first but then I saw my reflection in the window, she was stabbing at my reflection, and that too on the hand of my reflection, the same spot where she got the cut at the party.\n\nI filled the glass of water and threw it at her, the water immediately turned to steam when it touched her skin and she fell down. I picked her up and carried her to the bedroom. She was perfectly asleep. I sat on the bed searching for psychiatrists as well as paranormal experts. The next morning she didn't remember what happened and refused to seek medical help as she said she was feeling fit and fine.\n\nI requested her and seeing my concern she agreed after a few minutes, we went to the psychiatrist and I explained to her everything, every word of my mouth seemed like a shock to Alice, and in the end, she became speechless. The doctor prescribed medicine for a night of proper sleep and told us that this might be the result of the shock from the incident at the party but she couldn't explain her deep black or white eyes.\n\nThat night went out in peace Alice was asleep but I was awake to see what exactly happened to her although her skin did turn white at 2:09 she was still asleep and soon the sun came out. After a few nights, she started to sleep without any changes in her even at 2:09 and that's when one night I slept too I heard a weep but this time loud and near me, I woke up to turn but Alice was sitting on top of me glaring at me with those white eyes and the moonlight fell on her this time too, her skin white and she titled her head a little she had a glass piece in her hand, she was weeping but this time the smile which she flashed at me while hugging the kid at the party that same smile was plastered on her face.\n\nThat smile back then was of sympathy but this time it sent a chill down my spine she now started to look at my hand and when she was about to stab my hand I picked up the lamp near my bed and smashed at her head and pushed her, she was still like a stone but the smash at her head might've made her shaky so I was able to push her off and run down while locking her to call her mother to inquire about whether she had this sort of behavior in the past...but I am not afraid of her actions I am rather afraid of the smile she flashed before I locked her in our bedroom...",

        "text": "It’s not like there’s a good time for it, and I may be biased, but I’m convinced 14 is the worst age to be when your dad dies. \n\nI suppose it depends on what stage of your life you’re in. The worst age for some might be 17 or 34. But I’m talking averages, here. I picked 14 because… well… I think that’s when we appreciate our parents the least.\n\nMy dad was old when I was born—49—and despite that gulf between us, for the first dozen years of my life we were as close as father and daughter could be. \n\nHe worked as a carpenter, and my earliest and best memories were all standing hip-high to him in his workshop in the garage. I was his little helper. I’d hand him his tools and sweep up his saw dust. \n\nI knew what a carpentry plane was when I was six years old.\n\nI’d sing along with him to his Hank Williams, and when I grew up and developed my own musical tastes, he let me put my pop music on in the workshop. He probably hated it, but he even sang and hummed along because he loved me. \n\nI remember nights when I’d race through my homework just so I could stay up with him in the shop while he finished a walnut trestle table or a cherry-wood wardrobe. I was addicted to it all. The smell of the different wood shavings, the confidence of my father’s hands, his loving smile that greeted me when I burst through the door to join him.  \n\nMy dad always worked late into the night and I thought he was just in love with his work. I was too young to realize how hard he worked just to keep us out of poverty.\n\nHe’d always come in to tuck me into bed on the nights I didn’t fall asleep watching him in his workshop. I’d giggle as some of the blonde dandruff of sawdust fell out of his beard as he pulled the covers to my neck and kissed my forehead goodnight. Life was never as good as it was in that little house on Chester Street. \n\nSee, puberty hit. In the span of a few short months, carpentry was no longer cool, and my father wasn’t my buddy. He was lame. His jokes that used to make me giggle caused my eyeballs to roll back to my brain. \n\nI was a broody teenager and found myself struggling with depression by the time freshman year rolled around. It didn’t help that my dad was always worried about me. He’d knock gently on my door to see how I was doing on the nights when I disappeared into my room after dinner.\n\nHe made a final effort before the hormones took over. I was in my room, staring at my computer when he knocked on the door. \n\n“What?!” I asked annoyed. \n\nHe peeked his head in. “Hey, no pressure, but I could sure use an extra set of hands on this table trim I’m doing. You interested?” He gave me a half smile.  \n\nHe’d caught me in a particularly salty teenaged mood. “I don’t want to help you with your stupid carpentry. I’m old enough to know better.”\n\n“Oh, you sure? I think you’d really like this trim set I’ve—”\n\n“Yes!” I interrupted him with a shout. “I’m sure, dad. Sorry you don’t have an unpaid helper anymore. Perhaps if you got an actual job you could afford one.” Why do hormones hunt for the cruelest words they can find? \n\nEven with my anger, my heart still hurt when I saw his smile fade into sadness. He pursed his lips, nodded at me and shut my door gently. \n\nThe next few months were filled with exchanges like that. I got really into drawing around then. I drew horror scenes. Like Alice and Wonderland meets Stephen King. My dad hated horror. He got too afraid and my mom and I would tease him for it. But still around that time he was always asking me what I was drawing.\n\nI shooed him away. It wasn’t his thing anyway so why did he care? It took me another couple years to realize he was just trying to bond in any new way that he could now that carpentry was gone from my interests. But I never gave him the time of day. \n\nThen he got sick. Yeah, it was quick. Apparently pancreatic cancer is the deadliest because it’s so hard to detect. Once they find it’s metastasized. Spread too far to stop. \n\nMy strong, lively father was reduced to a husk of himself in just months. Around February of my Freshman year, he was sent back from the hospital for in-home hospice. \n\nI couldn’t even comprehend the word hospice. My dad, dying? I was older, but he was still immortal in my mind—oxen and confident. I couldn’t stand to see him in what his death bed would be. \n\nHe lost weight so quickly. His chest and cheeks hollowed. On the first day he got back from the hospital I sat by his bedside. It was just me and him. My mom was out picking up his prescriptions that he didn’t want because they would bankrupt us. \n\n“So, kiddo, you want to show me some of your drawings?” asked my father. \n\nI shook my head. I couldn’t bring myself to cry. I was stoic, unbelieving. Reality was still so shocking that it felt fake. \n\n“Listen, I’m not going to mince words. I need you to go easy on your mother. She doesn’t display emotion, but this is going to hurt her like hell and she’s going to need you.”\n\nI looked away from his eyes to keep myself from crying. We were quiet and he reached out and grabbed my hand. “Can I tell you something, sweetie?” \n\nI looked back to him. “Yeah.”\n\nHis breath quivered as he inhaled. “I’m *scared*.” Tears rushed from both his eyes. “I had this idea that I’d smile to the end and give you and your mother the best version of myself to remember, but… I’m terrified. I don’t want to die.” \n\nI pulled my hand away from his like it was hot. His words hollowed out my insides. I didn’t think my dad was afraid of anything. To see him reduced to this made me scared. *I* was terrified. \n\n“I know I’m supposed to be your big, strong dad but I’m dying, Katie. And I’m so damn afraid.” \n\n“Yeah,” It was all I said. I mean, I was 14. I wasn’t emotionally prepped for this. I couldn’t properly communicate my feelings about what I wanted for dinner let alone how I felt about my dying dad. \n\nSo, I withdrew. I was scared to see him, and I went by his room as little as possible. He didn’t pressure me; he was wise enough to understand how hard this was for me.\n\nOne night, when he was really fading, I went to the movies with a friend. It was the kind of escape I needed. I remembered staying in my seats as the credits rolled. I hated the feeling of reality settling in when I stepped out of the theater before my dad was sick. \n\nMy phone had been off and when I turned it, back on I saw that I had about a dozen missed calls from my mom. Her texts said that my dad was fading and fast. \n\nI raced home in a teary panic. I couldn’t believe how distant I’d been to him. I wanted to wrap my arms around him, to sob into his chest, tell him how sorry I was I hadn’t been closer with him the last couple years, not just when he was sick. \n\nI burst through the front door, confused to see that the living room was full. My aunts, uncles and a couple cousins were there. Apparently, my dad had already passed. They gathered around him, holding his hand as his breath faded. \n\nI sat cross-legged on the floor. They still hadn’t called the coroner. They were waiting for me to come home and say goodbye. But say goodbye to what? He was already gone. \n\nBefore everyone left, my mean aunt turned to me. “You should’ve been here. He was calling for you. He wanted you there. “Where’s Katie?” Those were your dad’s last words. Do you know that?”\n\n“Janet, stop,” said her son. But I could tell from everyone’s faces that she was telling the truth. \n\nIt all came out then. I’ll spare you the worst details. What I didn’t know was that would be the last night I spent in that house. My mom put me in-patient treatment center for the next month. I resented her for it at first but looking back she didn’t have a choice. I went off the rails. \n\nI wasn’t much better when I got out. My mom had moved across town to a dingy townhome. She thought we were better off in a place without those old memories hanging over us. I’m not sure she was right. \n\nAfter a loved one dies, our memories of them start as a fresh fruit. They’re green, inedible and too tough to swallow. The nostalgia seems useless—hurtful. But death ripens over time. Eventually, those memories sweeten, and while they’ll still smart, I know we’re better off remembering.\n\nBut it was too late for that. Dad’s death did bankrupt us. We had to move. Now, the train and the drunk neighbor next door took turns rattling our window frames with their roars. \n\nDogs barked. Kids skipped school and drugs and cash were exchanged in handshakes. And it wasn’t long before I knew every secret handshake on the block. \n\nThe next four-years were hell. I couldn’t hold a job and if I did my paychecks went to drugs and partying. There was no way I could afford to live on my own, or with roommates. So, when I turned 18 my mom gave me an ultimatum: Go to community college or live on the street. \n\nShe wouldn’t have *actually* kicked me out into the street, but I still had a conscience; I wanted to make her happy. \n\nI enrolled for fall semester. The class I was most interested in was, “Ancient Lore &amp; Spiritualty in the Western Hemisphere.” \n\nIt sounded like an easy three-credit-course, and I got to learn about Voodoo and Shamans. I thought what the hell. \n\nOn my first day I was surprised to find the classroom dark and lit entirely by a few candles. Most of the students chuckled a little when they came in. This was just the kind of easy course they were looking for. \n\nOur teacher was serious, however. She was a Caribbean woman with a thick accent. Her name was Mrs. Dupont. \n\nFor introductions, she made us tell a local story we had heard about spirits. After half the class had gone one student’s story took me from my daydreaming. \n\nA kid with an alternative look—black clothes, studded belt, conductors cap—was talking. \n\n“In 2018, some family moved into a house in the Piedmont neighborhood. Apparently, blood started seeping from the walls, and the husband and wife both had horrible nightmares night after night.” \n\n“Hey,” one girl interrupted him. “I’ve heard about that, too. Another family moved in but didn’t even last a month. Same thing, nightmares, moving furniture—satanic shit. \n\n“Yeah!” The alternative kid nodded. “The house is vacant now and rumor has it the bank won’t even bring it to auction until rumors die down.” \n\n“Wait,” I raised my hand awkwardly. “Where in Piedmont?” \n\n“Chestnut Street,” said the girl confidently. “The house is on Chestnut Street.” \n\nI stayed after everyone had left the classroom and approached Mrs. Dupont cautiously.\n\n“Um, Mrs. Dupont? Do you have minute?”\n\nShe paused and looked into my eyes. She had a wise and kind gaze, but she looked deeper than surface level. I felt seen. “Sure, honey. What’s troubling you?” \n\nI told her everything. I didn’t plan too but she was of one the warmest people I’ve talked to in years. In a way, she reminded me of my father.\n\n“You think this spirit is that of your dad?” \n\n“Yeah,” I nodded. “I mean, it could be a different house. But 2018, Chestnut Street? It all adds up.” \n\n“Human spirits decide to stay when they die unsatisfied. Your father had an option to go to the great beyond, but he stayed. Was he a spiteful man in life?”\n\n“No, not at all. The hauntings he’s put these people through don’t sound like him.”\n\n“Death can do horrible things to a spirit. The hate of a life left unfulfilled can infect them.”\n\n“I want to help him.”\n\nMrs. Dupont lifted her brow, cautiously. “I don’t think that is wise. What you know of your father is gone. If he’s haunting and putting nightmares into people’s mind, then his spirit has been corrupted.” Before I could speak, she continued. “But I don’t plan to keep a mourning daughter from seeing her father. You will do what you will do. But I warn you, child, these hauntings are a sign that your father is a monster now. Something you will not recognize. Do you understand me?”\n\nI nodded and she undid a latch on her satchel bag. She pulled out a candle made of purple and black wax and a wick of white sage. \n\n“Light this, it will at least protect you while you make this discovery for yourself. Life is one big stove top and unfortunately, we must be burned by everything in order to learn. Good luck.” \n\nWhen the dimly lit classroom was behind me and I stood in the bright hall, I wasn’t even sure I believed any of that crap. Spirits, ghosts, it all seemed like a joke. But Mrs. Dupont was wise, she knew I had to see for myself. \n\nThat night, I took the bus to my old neighborhood. I hadn’t been there since. For four years I’d actively avoided going anywhere near our old house. \n\nNow, I was standing directly in front of it. \n\nIt was as ominous as a haunted house is supposed to look. I mean, it wasn’t a Victorian mansion. It was a little Sears kit home—a common enough style of house in Wayne County—but the shutters were crooked, and the paint was peeling. The home looked about as inviting as a dank cave. \n\nI looked over my shoulder as I went through the chain link fence to the backyard. The bank had boarded the doors up to keep squatters and teens out, but someone had busted one of the basement windows. I dropped to my knees and crawled through. \n\nI was in the laundry room and my first instinct was to flip the light switch, but of course, no power. I stepped cautiously toward the basement stairs. \n\nSquatters and teen vandals had made short work of the place. The walls were covered in graffiti and fist-sized holes where drunk boys had punched the drywall \n\n“Sorry, you don’t have the best company, dad. I’d be mad, too.” I said aloud. Then I remembered the ghost of my father had supposedly scared good families away. Maybe these drug doing heathens were now more his sprit’s style. \n\nMy heart stopped when I got to the living room. My hands became clammy and I wanted to run. All the hardwood had been pried up and beneath was a giant pentagram drawn in black paint. In its center was a curled mass of fur. A rabbit, or some large rodent. \n\n“That’s not you…” I said as if my dad could hear. I was sure this was probably also the doing of teen vandals. The rumors said it was a haunted house, and the local kids probably went with the theme of keeping things spooky. \n\nBut I was done. This kind thing wasn’t me. I didn’t believe in ghosts. My dad was dead, in the ground. His soul was not angry and lurking on earth. \n\nI turned back toward the basement stairs but stood shocked still before I could go down them. There was a black silhouette of a person. Of a man, large, like my father, at the foot of the basement stairs. “D—Dad?” I stuttered but the shadow didn’t respond. \n\nI backed up slowly and then pivoted and ran. The back door was covered in a sheet of plywood, but thankfully the wood it was nailed into had rotted and I burst through it into the back yard. \n\nI thought about screaming, but then I thought better. I’d made enough noise busting out of the house. I already heard a dog barking next door. The last thing I wanted was to have to deal with the police. \n\nI stepped quickly towards the gate that led to the front so I could get back to the street, but the shadow I’d seen in the basement was blocking my path. It was undoubtedly my father. It’s funny how our minds don’t always need faces or voices. The simple shape of him I knew by heart. But I wasn’t happy to see it, his cold black form left me breathless. I ran again this time the only direction I had left.  \n\nI went straight into the garage and locked the door behind me. I was trapped unless I wanted to call the police. My mind suddenly raced to if I was even safe or not. I’d never heard of anybody being murdered by a ghost, but then again maybe that’s because such cases remain unsolved. \n\nI backed up slowly, running my hands across the workbench to hopefully heft a hammer, an empty bottle, anything I could use as a weapon. But then the lights came on, a saw hummed as it idled. I turned around and stared at awe. \n\nMy father’s workshop was just as it had been the last time I saw it. I was blinking away disbelief when suddenly, the smell of sawdust made me go numb with nostalgia. \n\n“Fuck,” I said aloud.\n\nThe big circular saw whirled to life and I just about jumped out of my skin. The blade came down and sank through a 2x10 board, and the cloud of dust settled around a shape. Broad shoulders, a big bushy beard. My breath stuttered as I exhaled. “Dad?”\n\nThe saw went down into the 2x10 again and again, notching it—making little divots and shallow cuts. I realized the saw was writing. \n\nI walked closer, skeptically. I watched the saw work, looking up and down in shock. After a few minutes, the saw died and I leaned over the board. \n\n“Sorry for the scare,” I said aloud, reading what was sawn into the wood. “I can’t communicate in the house. It seems like my soul is stuck in this workshop…” I looked up at the saw blade as it reeved a few times as if in affirmative to what I was reading. I exhaled a laugh. \n\n“My Katie, I’ve haunted a few families out of here in hopes you would hear the tales. In hopes that you would return here, to find me. I thought I made for a pretty spooky ghost.” \n\n“And wood you look at that, a plan came together. You can ask me yes or no. One spin is yes, two is no…”\n\nThat was the end of the writing. I looked up at the saw. “Are you talking about communicating with this saw?” The saw spun once.\n\nI looked around for a hidden camera, then I realized it probably didn’t make for good YouTube content to prank a girl about her dead dad coming back to life. Or who knows, I hadn’t been on YouTube for a while, maybe that’d be a hit. \n\n“Dad is this you… seriously?”\n\nAnother single spin. I reached out to where the sawdust had first shown his form, but I couldn’t feel anything.  \n\n“Why can’t I touch you?” The saw was silent. “Right, right. Yes or no only.” I chewed my lip trying to think of a question. “Can you show yourself?” The saw spun once. “Then why don’t you?”\n\nThe blade stayed on and started to move down, I flinched back as it started writing on the 2x10 again. When the sound died, I leaned forward to read, “It will take everything I have, and it won’t be for long.”\n\nI looked at the saw. “You mean you won’t be around anymore?” It responded with a single turn. “Well dad, if you’re really here you can come say hi. Or I guess you can just spend eternity as this old saw. But that probably doesn’t sound awful to you, does it?” \n\nThe saw revved once, and I laughed, but I was quickly silenced. A wind began to blow, and a little cyclone of sawdust built up. When it settled, there smiling at me sadly, was my dad. \n\n“Oh…” I choked on my words. “Oh my god.” I said and began to cry. \n\n“It’s ok, sweetheart. But you’ve got to keep it together for a minute or two because we don’t have much time.”\n\nI nodded. “I’m sorry.”\n\n“You ain’t got nothing to be sorry about.”\n\n“I’m sorry I wasn’t there.” I sobbed. “I’m sorry I was so mean. I’m sorry you had to die when your only child was at the fucking mall.” \n\n“Hey, hey, hey. It’s alright. What movie did you see?”\n\n“I don’t know….” But I did remember. I remembered every damn detail of that night down to a Milk Dud that was stale and cracked on my teeth. “Ready Player One.” \n\n“Was it any good?” \n\n“No,” I sobbed and broke down into cries. “It sucked.” \n\n“Hey now, you didn’t do anything wrong.”\n\n“I did everything wrong.” I blurted out in a snotty cry.\n\n“No. Teenagers are supposed to fall away from their fathers, it’s my job to love you all the same. And cancer… well, what’s scarier than that?”\n\n“You were calling for me. The night you died. You—you needed me there and I was *too* scared. Too stupid.” \n\n“I wasn’t calling for you because I needed you, Katie. I was calling for you because I knew you needed to be there. Otherwise, you’d hate yourself. I knew the guilt would eat you for the rest of your life. And I was so scared of that,” he paused. “It was all I could think about. In the end, I wasn’t even scared of my own death; I was just scared of what it would do to you.” \n\nI was crying too much to get a breath in, my dad came nearer to me and put his arms around me. Although they were weightless, I still felt like they held him with his strength. \n\n“But sometimes, we don’t get to say goodbye. The last time you see someone you love you might say something you regret. You might hurt them. You might act like you’ll see them again to set things right but that won’t always be the case. Sometimes people die at the worst time, and it happens every day. But take it from me my darling. Take it from the dead—we don’t hold it against you. Not one bit.” \n\n“I love you,” I squeaked out. “Can’t you stay?”\n\n“Appearing to you now is taking all my spirit’s strength. I’m going to go soon.” \n\n“Where?”\n\n“I don’t know…” \n\n“Do you think I’ll see you again?”\n\n“Oh, sweetheart. Like this? Maybe. But I know you’ll see me in everything you do. I love you.” \n\n“I love you too, Dad.” I pressed my eyes shut tight and when I opened them, the garage was dark. The smell of sawdust… gone. The workbench was stained and bloated from rot and the rusty blade of the circular saw wasn’t shiny enough to even catch the moonlight. \n\nIt took me a long time to leave, and when I did, I walked home slowly, seven miles in the dark. \n\nI think I finally figured out what my dad meant by how I’ll see him in everything I do. He didn’t mean I’d see find him at the bottom of a pipe bowl or a liquor bottle.  \n\nNo, I see him a lot. But often it’s only when I’m in *my* workshop, gliding my carpentry plane along and smiling to the sweet smell of sawdust. After all, I think I make a pretty good carpenter.\n\nLike father, [like daughter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

        "text": "\nThis is a hard one to explain but I'm gonna try do my best!\nJust so you know, I'm someone who has had my fair share of paranormal in my life. I've seen many things that many would never believe. I've experienced fear in many ways. I've seen acts of greatness and things I myself find impossible. But here we are!\n\nSo, I'm going to tell you a story about something that happened to me only two days ago. Before that tho, a bit of back story to get you a bit in the scene.\n\nI have seven little brothers and two little sisters. My family is pretty big all round. Along the way, you meet people who are family to you even without blood. Years ago, I met someone I consider as a cousin to me due to the relationship his mum and my uncle had. To his day, he is a great friend. So he is always family to me. Now he is a grown man with full custody of his son. This isn't his only child, but he dedicates all his time to his son. From the moment I met his boy, I have adored him. In a way, he reminds me of my own son. See, his boy has autism, just like mine. His boy is also hard for people to understand a lot at his young age, just like mine was when he was younger. He has an energetic vibe and is very curious. Since my son's mother and I have split, I haven't been able to see my son much so seeing my friend's son was always a bit of a cheer up for me for a bit. It just reminds me of better times with my boy. The main thing I'm pointing out here tho is how his son was around people. Full of energy and curiosity. Hard for anybody to understand. His own father could only make out about half of what he could say on a good day. He has been like this the whole time I have known him. Just a young four year old autistic boy. \n\nSo two days ago, my brother and my friend decided to come wake me up and drag me out. They wanted to go to the river for a swim, so the plan was to go down to the river and cool off a bit. We would take some drinks, (alcoholic obviously) and some snacks and drinks for the young fella, and my friend, my brother and I would smoke some weed and go for a swim. I personally didn't feel like swimming tho, so when we got there, I decided to just sit on the river bank. My friend, my brother and my friend's son all went for a swim. I sat here just sipping my drink, yet I kept a close eye on my friends boy. He was young but wasn't afraid of the water one bit, which kept me on edge due to past experiences I've had with my own son. I kept reminding my friend to watch him. That it was too far out for him. That the current will pull him away. I was also a bit concerned because I had also seen evidence of bull sharks in this same fresh water river, so I was a bit of a worry wart. After a while tho, I became to calm down a bit because things were going ok. My brother and friend were throwing rocks and carrying on. The boy was staying close to the shore where I was hoping he would stay. I sat there for about an hour and a half before I was convinced by my brother and friend to get in the water. So I take off my shirt and walk on it. I realise the water doesn't get deeper where the current flows so I felt like a fool thinking it was too deep for the young fella, however, the current was stronger so I still suggested he stay close to the edge. I even made sure her had snacks ready and asked if he needed a drink before I went to walk out toward my brother and friend. I was about to step away when I heard the young fella next to me say something. Now, as I said before, he is very hard to understand, however, I clear as day heard him say these words. \"I can remember my past life you know?\"\n\nThis cought my attention right away. I'd never heard his say a sentence before so clearly. I turned and I said to him \"For real?\" And he looked at me and said, \"Yep!\" \n\nNow this is where it gets hard because for some reason right after our conversation, the memory started to get blurry. Things became hard to remember and hard to explain. But I will try anyways.\n\nSo, after he said yep to me, I was so intrigued that I sad down in the shallows near him. The point was to ask questions and see if I could learn anything interesting. I asked him pretty much straight away, \"So you're gonna forget all this when you get older?\" He responded with \"Uhuh!\"\n\nI then said \"So that's why you can't talk properly then I guess. So nobody can hear what you have to say?\"\nHe responds with \"yep! That's right!\"\n\nI felt bad for him instantly with this response, knowing all his knowledge and wisdom would just fade away over time. So I asked him how much of his past life he could remember, however, he shrugged the conversation away like he had no interest in it at all. It's hard to remember a lost of what was said exactly because, I dunno. It's hard to explain. It's like something doesn't want me to remember. But I will say this tho! I could clearly understand everything he was saying, even in his little boy autistic voice. It was infact a very intellectual conversation. I asked questions and he responded with full answers. As we sat her talking, he kept asking me to move bit by bit up the stream with him. \"Come over here and lay with me!\" \"Follow me!\" Or \"Come!\" Were the things he mainly said. But after a bit, he turns to me and says \"Come up here and let's go God Mode!\" \n\nThis was a weird moment for me. A part of me felt like I knew what he was talking bout when he said 'God Mode', but a still wasn't quite sure what he was saying, so I asked him \"What do you mean by God Mode?\"\n\nHe reacted with this noise of disapproval, kinda insinuating that I was being an idiot. He then says to me \"You know because you do it all the time! You just haven't realised it yet.\"\n\nAn inkling part of me seemed to understand what he was talking about then. Because of my own mental health issues, I live inside my head. My mind goes to places where I'm untouchable. I believe this is what he meant by God Mode. So he insists again \"Come on! Let's go do God Mode!\"\n\nSo I agreed with him. I moved along a bit closer to him, we both layed back in the water and I started to drift off into my mind. As I did tho, I could hear his start to swim away. I opened my eyes and called him out on it, to which he responded with \"No No! You go God mode! It'll be okay!\"\n\nEven tho, as we spoke, I could feel the presence of someone who was much older and much wiser than I was, I couldn't help but still see a little boy infront of me. So I would remain vigilant and keep on him about staying close to the shore. So instead of trying to swim away, he decided to come sit next to me again and talk some more. \n\nWe talked for a while and he says to me \"I want to take you to the door.\" \n\nWhen he said that, I had this vision of a dark steel door with a green glowing light shining through the gaps around the door. I said to him \"The Door?\"\n\nHe says to me after that \"Yeah! I want to take you to it and help guide you through.\"\n\nHe then says \"Come and I'll show you!\"\n\nThis kinda weirded me out a bit. It almost seemed a bit scary to me. I told him \" I'm not sure about that one.\" \n\nHe sighs with disapproval at me. The then said \"Come on! You're the one I chose to show!\"\n\nI then asked him \"well, why me?\"\n\nHe then respondes to me with something that really made me stop in my tracks. \"Because you're my Dad.\"\n\nI then said to him \"I am not your dad tho!\" I then pointed to his father and said that he is his dad.\n\nHe just looked away and said \"Yeah!\"\n\nI wasn't sure what to think about that part. Maybe is was saying that I was his dad in a past life or something? I really wasn't sure. I just didn't bring it up again after that. \n\nHe looked at me and he said \"you're close but you're not quite there yet.\"\n\nI stood there dumbfounded for a bit after he did that. Like, I'm close but not quite there. \n\nHe then moved closer to me and climbed over the top of me as he played in the water. Even tho he's talking to me like someone who is much older and wiser, hr still played like he was a little kid.\n\nHe then said to me \"Why don't you love yourself?\"\n\nI looked at him confused, as if to say 'how could he know I feel this about myself?'\n\n(He then says to me \"You should!\"\n\nI sat there and thought about those words before we continued our conversation.\n\nWe, at this point, had moved back closer to where we started the conversation. I asked him if he needed a drink. He said \"Yeah! Just two bits!\" So I went and got the orange juice and brought it to him. I lifted the bottle to his lips and after he took his second mouthful, I pulled it away, put the lid on and placed the bottle back up in the shade.\n\nI went back into the water and he said \"We should go down there and meet that person!\"\n\nI looked down stream to where he was pointing. It was across the stream toward a place where there was nobody. I asked him \"To meet who?\"\n\nHe said \"Just down there. We should go down there!\"\nI queried him again and then after that, he changed the direction he was pointing toward a couple a bit down stream who were fishing. I knew he wasn't pointing at them originally, but I played along with it. \n\nAfter a bit longer, I asked him about this 'door' that he mentioned earlier. Instead of talking about it tho, he said to me \"You should come under the water with me!\"\n\nI asked him why and he said \"So you can meet my friends.\"\nI asked \"your friends are under the water?\"\n\nHe said \"Uhuh! I can hear them when I put my head under the water.\"\n\nHe insisted that I try, but I didn't try. I just watched him sinking his head under the water and coming up within a couple seconds every time. \n\nHe then said to me \"You should come meet my friends! They will look after you.\"\n\nI looked at him still hesitant and said \"What if I don't want to meet your friends?\"\n\nThe then sighed loudly with disapproval again while rolling his eyes back. He then said to me in the next breath, \"You're all gonna die you know?\"\n\nThis startled me a bit, but I responded straight away with, \"Yeah! everybody does in the end.\"\n\nHe goes \"Yep!\" But a part of me could tell that that's not what he meant. It's like, he knows what's coming or something. \n\nI then told him that I'm going to tell his dad all about what we have been talking about. He said \"No! Don't do it!\"\nI asked him \"Why not? This is incredible and he should know.\"\n\nI then called out to his dad. I told him that I needed to talk to him about what his son and I had been discussing. I said to him \"You are not going to believe a word of what I have to say!\" \n\nHe called out \"What is it?\"\n\nI said to him \"He can remember his past life.\"\n\nAs I said these things, his son started to play in the water and gets bit of distance from me, so I called him out Infront of his dad. \"You're gonna play dumb and pretend this didn't happen aren't you?\"\n\nHe responded with \"Yep!\"\n\nHis dad went to ask me about it but I told him we would take about it a bit later. \n\nAfter a bit, he's come back and we are talking again. I asked him why he doesn't talk to his dad about it. He looked down and shrugged his shoulders, like he was unsure about his dad knowing anything. \n\nI told him \"You should! You should let everybody know. Wouldn't it be something if you could share two life stories?\"\nHe then says to me \"Two? You mean three!\"\n\nAs soon as he said it, I called to his dad \"He can remember two past lives. Not just one.\"\n\nAgain, he reacts as if to say he doesn't want me saying these things to his dad.\n\nI asked him \"Why are you talking to me tho instead of your dad or somebody?\"\n\nHe then said to me \"Its because I want you to be my bro. I need a bro, so you be my bro!\"\n\nI immediately felt for him when he said this. I mean just imagine being able to remember your past two lives. You're trapped in the body of a small child. Everybody overlooks you. Nobody takes you seriously. Nobody listens. You're always told what to do and where to can go. He must feel trapped. He must get lonely and bored. \n\nI said to him that I'll happily be his bro. We then fist bumped. \nNot long after, his dad and my brother both come back over to near the shore. This is where I tried to explain to his dad what we were just asking about, but as I was trying to do so, my memories started to fade right away. I told him that it's going fuzzy so fast. I realised that it's not meant to be a story that's easily told as I tried to first tell it. It's one of those things we aren't meant to know. \n\nAfter yelling him what I could recollect at that point, he tried to take his son over to the middle of the river and ask him about it. He asked if his son wanted to all to him. But he didn't want to open up. He just played along in he water like the son he always knew. \n\nAfter this, I've noticed the young fella is going under the water again. Only he's coming up with a mouthful of water and he's choking on it. I've pointed this out to his dad. His dad said \"yeah! He does stuff like that all the time.\"\nAfter a bit longer, my brother and his dad climb out of the river, I'm starting with the young fella still talking to him. Still in the most intellectual conversation I've ever been involved in all my life. \n\nHis dad calls out that it's time to go. I look at the young fella and say, \"You ready to go bud?\"\n\nHe goes, \"Not yet! It's not safe!\"\n\nAs he just finished saying this, I saw his dad out of the corner of my eye stumble backwards up the hill.\nEven those the ground was hard to walk on and was on a steep angle, I could tell what the boy was thinking. His dad might just be a bit too drunk or atoned to drive us home safely. So when his dad called out to hop out again, I said to him \"No!\" I told him that his son isn't ready to leave yet. \n\nHe said, \"Ofcoarse he doesn't!\" As he laughed but I insinuated that it was serious. So, hearing what I had been telling him about the conversation so far, he and my brother decided to stay around a bit longer. They jumped back in the river and went back to throwing more rocks. \n\nI then asked the young fella \"You can tell something bad is gonna happen can't you?\"\n\nHe just nodded as he stared down into the water. \nWe talked more. At this point we had been talking for atleast 2 hours. I had been asking about how hard it must be being a child with his mind. \n\nHe said that I have no idea he said these words exactly \"I want to get high so badly!\"\n\nI kinda giggled but I also felt so bad for him. Seeing his dad and his dad's mates smoking bongs together. Yet he is only a little kid so there's no way that's happening. Sorry Buddy!\nHe then went back to dunking his head under the water. He would come up with a mouthful of water every time nearly. It is almost like he is deliberately trying to drown himself. I try to stop him and I asked him why he keeps doing that. \nHe then said to me, \"I don't wanna be here anymore!\"\n\nThese words are heartbreaking for me to hear. A little kid who has given up on life? That sucks. So I asked him why. \nHe said to me \"it's because of you guys!\"\n\nI kinda got what he meant by that. I asked him, is it because we are boring?\n\nHe said \"Yeah! And I don't want to be here anymore!\"\n\nHe then said to me \"I wanna go be with my friends!\"\n\nI asked \"your friends you can hear under the water?\"\n\nHe said \"Yeah! I can hear them calling me when I'm under the water. I want to go be with them. It's a peaceful way to go.\"\n\nThese words were not only freaky to me, but also very heart felt. It made me realise that I know how he feels. I have felt for a while now that I don want to be here anymore. I feel I'm ready to move onto the next big thing. I feel there's nothing left here in life for me. \n\nAs for him, a wise wise soul who is trapped in a four year old body, he is someone who knows what is gonna happen next. He somehow has seen here out future lies I believe. He doesn't see the point is staying here until the end. I also felt that's what he meant when he said to me earlier that I'm not quite there yet. Like I feel ready to move on, but I'm letting my earthly ties hold me to this place. \n\nAll I could do tho, even tho I felt how he has, I try to convince him that he can't just do that. People love him. He has to be strong for those around him. He sighed again tho, as if to say that I've got it all wrong.\n\nI told his father about this conversation as well immediately right in front of him. \n\nAfter talking. Little bit more, all the sudden, I hear an unknown voice from right behind me. I turned to see a man sitting on a horse right near all of our stuff. It was startling, as if he just appeared out of no where. \n\nHe was calling out my my friend and my brother, yelling at them because of hem throwing rocks at the bottom of the bridge, trying to know the flood debris down. Between my brother and this guy, things started to get a little heated so I had to call to my brother to just drop it. My brother and friend climbed out for the river again and started to take to this guy. He started talking about weed and other tuff with my brother and mate. He even offered them a cone to which the agreed. I sked the young fella if he was ready to hop out yet. He said to me \"No!\" He then looked at the guy on the horse and said \"He's the Devil!\"\n\nWhen he said this, I just said \"Ok?\" And I left it at that. \n\nAfter a little while longer, his dad starts to push for us to go again. Again the young fella wasn't interested in leaving, but after a while, I insisted to him, \"You know your dad is the one who is saying it's time to go, and one thing we are always taught is to respect our father. Right?\"\n\nHe reluctantly agreed. We then jumped out of the water. It didn't take long before he, his dad and my brother were disappearing up the hill toward the car. Meanwhile, the guy on the horse was taking to me. He offered me a cone, and I accepted. It was pretty good weed. My tolerance is really high so I didn't mind it. He then talked about the rubbish people leave laying around down there, and after I moved a couple things for him and I gathered upa. Heap of rubbish, including some that belonged to us, I tried to all toward the car. This man just kept talking to kw tho. He asked about darts, which I played as said he should come check out because he used to play. I wasn't trying to be rude but I had to go. They were waiting for me. \n\nI then got to the hill and I forgot my way up the path to get to the car. Then I realised I didn't have my keys or smokes. I went back over to look for them just after the guy rode past me on the horse. He was talking like he was talking to me still, but he rode past without looking at me and when I responded to him, he just seemed to ignore me and keep riding. \n\nI searched for my keys and couldn't find them, so I worked m way up the hill to the car with all excess rubbish I had picked up. Luckily they had grabbed my keys and smokes when they had left.\n\nBy this time tho, the young boy was int he car, strapped in, not saying a word. Infact, he was silent all the way home. \nThe next day, which was yesterday, I got in contact with his father to discuss what was being said a bit more. I told him everything I could remember of it, other than the fact that his son told me that I was his dad. I didn't want to mention that part yet. I mean, especially to his father. So I left that little bit out. But when I called, he was actually more intrigued than he seemed the day before. I don't know if he took me seriously or not when I told him, but he was definitely taking me more seriously now that we were talking over the phone. \n\nHe told me that that morning when he woke up to his son, his son was telling him three different stories. He told me that he cannot remember a single bit of any of these stories. It's like it's all fuzzy and blurred out. What he can remember tho is how something that was said in these stories spin him out. How he thought right to what I was telling him the day before. He started to realise about his son remembering his past life. But fe some reason, it's likw the memories over he conversation were being washed away or something. \nIt's exactly how I felt. When I first went to tell my friend about what his son and I were taking about, immediately I could feel the memories going fuzzy. It's almost like, something doesn't allow us to remember. \n\nMy friend and I also went on to discuss the things we had already discussed the day before. About God Mode, The Door, how we were all gonna die, how he doesn't want to be here anymore. My friend went on to tell me how his son has always loved the water but he has always swollowed it and has had troubles in it. It kinda ties in with what I was saying about how he's deliberately trying to drown himself. \n\nI then went on to say to my friend that I'd like to try talk to him again. He said to me that maybe it needs to be one on one for him to want to open up. \n\nI said to him that I want I know about the door tho. I told him that I'm going to ask his son if he will lead me to it and show it to me. If he will help guide me thu as he had already offered me. I am going to tell him that I'm ready.\nHis father and I are supposed to meet up in a couple of days from now.\n\nI have so many questions and thoughts. I don't know he will even remember the conversation we had, let alone if I'll even be able to understand him again. I'm hoping that he does tho. I'm hoping that he can show me where my next step should be. He said I'm close but not quite there. He knows I'm ready to move on. I just haven't gotten to the level of wisdom he has yet. Perhaps this is all just something to hats gonna make me look or sound crazy for the rest of my life, but I admire this kid. He has tougher me things about stuff that most people alive could never understand. Yet at the same time, he's left me wondering. He's left me curious. So when I go see him, I'm gonna ask about going through the door. If he agrees, I wonder where he might take me. I wonder where this door could possibly lead to.",

        "text": "Through the thin trail behind the backyard fence of my old house, concealed by damp trees tall as cranes and soaked in years of rot, there are the remains of some sort of wooden structure. It smells like death, and even during the aridest months of the year, the upright planks are soggier than ever and have those wobbly wrinkles you get on the tips of your fingers after a long bath. \n\nFor the less-than-a-week that I lived in that house, there would always be a shadow in the corner of every room I entered. The shadow was roughly humanoid - the silhouette at least. Not its eyes. Its eyes were a long hollow black, boring into me, seeing beyond me. Sometimes when I was far away, like at my friend Mark's house, it wouldn't follow me, but I knew it was there when I heard it *breathing.* \n\nI bought my old house - I say 'old' because I no longer live there - for a remarkably cheap price. The previous owner couldn't wait to get rid of it; I named a price of scarcely five digits and he threw the housekeys into my hand and closed it with his two stained ones. He looked at me through those typical Irish eyebrows and pursed his lips in a desperate smile as if he were thanking me for taking the house. He left in his blue tin-can truck as soon as I stuck the key into the front door.\n\nThe house was already furnished and in a state healthy enough for me to spend plenty of time there without renovation. I went snooping around the halls, newly painted with a warm white unlike those dystopian modern houses with such dismal blueish whites, and found the backyard. The grass was autumn-brown and the wooden fence was a matching amber. I went through the stretch of woods behind the house, and that's where I found the ruins. \n\nI was immediately disturbed, the sky was an appropriate grey and I felt like I wasn't alone in those woods. As the large-framed adult male I am, I still felt completely vulnerable, but what would have scared me most at the time would not have been a human threat. I could sense something beyond human, *like* human. I got the hell out of there but that feeling that I was being watched never left.\n\nI first heard the breathing in the furthermost corner of the living room that night. I was sleeping on the pull-out couch. \n\nIn my brief sleep inertia, still unable to differentiate dream from reality, I mumbled \"Hellooo?\" into the stale mid-year air. \n\nAs soon as I realised there was somebody standing in the corner of the room, I jumped to my feet and stared at it.\n\n\"Who the fuck are *you?\"* I barked, more awake than I was yesterday midday. \n\nI clutched the corkscrew on the counter next to me and flicked the light switch. I now had a completely lucid view of whatever was standing right there. I think I would have preferred it to be an armed intruder at the time because I knew that this shadow was worse than anything I could have imagined. I rang up my friend Mark and spent the night at his house. \n\n\"You going to explain what happened last night?\" Mark asked with a hoarse undertone. \n\nHe jammed his palm into the corner of his eyesocket and rubbed. It was morning time, and I could tell Mark was a little pissed about the whole thing. He's never been an emotionally present kind of guy, and in a way, I think that's why I love being around him so much. He grounds me, brings me back to Earth, unlike so many of my other friends who respond to my discontentedness with a bouquet of lies to console me. \n\n\"No.\" I say dully.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You'd think I'm crazy.\"\n\n\"I already do.\" \n\nWe chuckle a bit, and before I can object, I'm being stuffed into my green Toyota. It's a humble car, small, and still smells new. Mark and I wave goodbye, and he slides his flat hands into his pockets as he shrinks in the distance. \n\nHalfway home I heard the breathing. *It's in the backseat,* the words hissed in my head like a hot-iron branding. I couldn't look in the backseat mirror. Not because I was scared to see if it was there, but I was scared to see if it had changed. If somehow it's worse than before. \n\nI had to sleep in the house that night. Mark would have been irate if I had invited myself over again. I couldn't think of anything but that thing as I mindlessly scrolled through my phone. I refused to look at it, but I think it was lustful for my attention. After an hour it was a foot from my face. \n\nThe following morning I booked a visit to a nearby psychic. I'd never believed in anything beyond evolution before this, so I felt alien to this 'spiritual community'. Seeing a psychic seemed like the most appropriate consultation as I'm not sure that shadow is... alive. If that's what psychics specialise in and not mediums. I walked seven miles to get there. I didn't want that thing to appear in my backseat again. \n\nShe was tall - the psychic - and dressed modestly. Beads adorned her bony wrists and they jangled as she beckoned me to the back-room, the 'reading room' as she called it. She wasn't one of those stereotypical psychics, old and drowning in brooches and jewels. But you could definitely tell she was witchy. \n\nShe pulled out the chair opposing her office-like desk, and swiftly took her own seat, motioning for me to sit down. I sat down across from her, and gawked at the bones and little herb jars in front of me. \n\n\"You paid for a general reading. Those are for... future predictions, and to help you get a better sense of your life right now.\" she purred with a smirk.\n\n\"I did.\" I respond earnestly, knowing full well that I had no idea what the choices meant, only that I felt seeing a psychic in general was enough. \n\n\"Are you sure that was the right choice?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I sense that a general reading is not why you came here.\"\n\n\"And how do you know that?\" I take it easily, edging on the subject, in case psychics don't actually deal with shadows that follow you around everywhere.\n\n\"You have a friend.\" she said with a coy smile, and pointed to the corner of the room. Behind me. I was almost relieved that she could see it. \n\nI didn't follow to where she pointed, and instead I looked down at the supplies in front of me. She whisked them away with a clean scoop, counted the bones, and put them aside. She looked at me, took my hands in hers, looked down, and adjusted her posture as a sort of preparation, or confirmation that whatever-she-does was about to start. She whispered something softly, soft enough that I couldn't understand. \n\nShe had a mysterious glow about her, almost a dark glow that you couldn't pick up with your eyes but could somehow smell it. She was alluring, in the mystical sense. \"You have quite the entity with you.\" she said.\n\n\"Entity? What *entity?\"* I ask, unnerved. She spat a little 'shh' at me, and continued.\n\nShe jolted, and stared at me with the ugliest face I've ever seen. Eyes locked open, pupils staring right at my chest, the most intense grimace. \n\n\"That is a *monster.* You are dealing with *evil.* That is one of the most intense forces I've ever come across. That thing has been responsible, or worked with the force that has ended many innocent lives, naive ones, defenseless ones.\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"Kids. It killed kids. Children. Oh, my god.\" she looked visibly distressed, eliminating the elite professionalism I had just seen in her. \n\n\"How do I get rid of it?\" I said, ramping into a panicked yell. \n\n\"You get rid of the reason it's there. Have there been any changes in your life recently, a new person you're dating or the death of a loved one?\" she articulated, not to me, but to my eyes.\n\n\"I moved into a new house a few days ago?\" I posed. Her eyes dropped and her face sagged. Almost like somebody sucked the blood from her body and now she's a pile of bones and flesh.\n\n\"Get out.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent the next few days packing what I unleashed in that house, furiously stuffing all of my clothes into various bags and losing my temper when I had to redo it, because it meant that I had to spend more time in that house. \n\nThe breathing from that shadow never stopped. Eventually it became ambient noise, but it still persisted tirelessly. Sometimes I stared at the shadow in repulsion, but eventually had to look away because it disturbed me too much. Sometimes I censored it with my hand, especially when I was going to the toilet or showering. \n\nI knew I absolutely had enough when I had a dream of a little girl standing in those rotten ruins behind the house. Her outfit was stained with a lick of dirt, and I just felt horrible for her. I think it was my mind conjuring the image of whatever would dismay me most at the time, but I took it as a sign.\n\nWhen morning rose I threw myself out of the house and marched to that strip of woods with the wooden ruins and kicked down the foundations. A cloud of dust and rot exploded every time I made an impact with a plank, but it didn't stop me. My black jeans transitioned to a putrid grey, splotchy, and in some parts, white. I let my feelings loose and disfigured whatever was left, until it was a dent of fungus and decay. My tears did nothing to the already saturated soil.\n\nIt is borderline humiliating having to deal with this, having some shadow antagonize you the moment you move into a brand new house. This is the first *real* house I've ever bought, and it felt like I was throwing myself into the atrocities of adulthood. The adulthood of regime and routine and the monotonous click-clacking of the keyboards in the mundane office job I was inexorably bound to work in. The adulthood where phones ringing sound like birds chirping compared to the chatter of the downtown cars or the silence of rural country. \n\nI should be thrilled to be a homeowner! How little people get to have one of those nowadays. I knew that the odds of me getting a house was slim-to-none but when I saw the listing my eyes gleamed and I heard a twinkle from my bank account, full of my teenage retail money that I refused to spend all throughout the time I was making it. It was instinct, calling on a paradigm Mother and Mark drilled into me. \n\nI followed the ruins, sinking into the directionless woods, kicking down every plank, until I reached flat land. The trees didn't thin, but the grass was much shorter, and the sound of the streets was drowned out by the rustling above. And that's when I saw it. The most vile thing I have ever seen and ever will see. A sprout of blonde hair coming from a concave in the Earth. Stapled to the dirt by treacherous rains and whatever animals may have trampled over it. I looked around, barely conscious, and scattered around were four more disturbed concaves in the ground. They must have once been holes, but were filled. Human shaped holes. *Small* human shaped holes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police tracked the culprit down by the fifth week after I made the call. He had owned the house before the guy who sold me the house. \n\nSometimes that bit of blonde hair floats up behind my cup of tea or in my lunchtime sandwich, and I'm suddenly not in the mood to eat anymore. Sometimes I step in a ditch outside of my new house, far, *far* away, and think that I just stepped on a dead kid underneath the soil. Sometimes I can't sleep, thinking about what those ruins may have been when they were once a structure. \n\nBut I think now I'm ready to talk about everything that happened. It seems like the only thing I really can do at this stage. And I have questions. A lot of questions. Some about the house, most about that shadow.",

        "text": " If you were in the New York underworld in the early 2000s, you might have heard of her. I have no clue where she went afterwards, but I just want to talk.\n\nFirst, I’ll introduce myself! I was a detective in the NYPD for several years, before retiring in 2013. Around 2006 or so, I was assigned to the case of an organ trafficking ring causing people to go mysteriously missing. After months of investigation, we began to make actual arrests of the higher-ups in the ring and zeroed down to the rough location of the headquarters, the place where a certain ‘Body Mary’ conducted her grisly business.\n\nEventually, I got to meet Body Mary. And it was enlightening, but a terrible experience.\n\nThat day, I was ordered to investigate the pharmacy that we suspected was a front, or at the very least affiliated with her. And by ‘I’, it was just me and the backup patrols a few streets away, as the higher-ups wanted to keep the investigation discreet. So, I took the warrant and drove in my car to a rundown building in the hoods. At the front, a sign said ‘Local Drugstore’ which had been referenced several times in our reports, so I knew it was the right place. Seeing it was open, I informed the nearby patrols and stepped in.\n\n“Welcome to our drugstore. How may I help you today?” said a beefy young black man standing behind the counter.\n\n“Good morning, I’m Miller. A detective of the NYPD. We have a warrant to search the premises.”, I explained.\n\nThe man did nothing, except to press a singular button on his wireless earphones. It might not seem like much now, but back then that was bleeding edge technology. Sure enough, it looked pretty damn suspicious.\n\n“And why do you intend to search the premises?” the man asked. \n\n“We have information that you are harbouring a dangerous criminal. Now, I shall start searching the premises.”, I said. Surprisingly, the man didn’t try to stop me, instead mentioning that there were 3 floors in the building. Since there was nothing on the first floor, I walked up the stairs to the second floor and flicked the light switch on.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how dusty the room was. It looked like it hadn’t been cleaned or used in ages, though it appeared to be a warehouse judging by the few cardboard boxes scattered around. As I walked around, I didn’t discover a single sign of any illicit activity in the area, and sighed frustratedly assuming that I’d have to go back to square one at that rate. \n\nThe next thing I noticed was a flash of blue to my behind. I reflexively pulled out my pistol and aimed it at my target, but realised it was too late as a syringe needle plunged into my back. As my vision blurred, I dropped onto the floor woozily as the girl who pulled a fast one on me unceremoniously dragged me by my feet.\n\nAn undeterminable amount of time later, I woke up elsewhere. As I gathered my bearings, I realised I was tied with thick ropes to a hard wooden chair. \n\nI looked forward at the girl. As I noted earlier, surprisingly enough, she was a teenage girl who didn’t look any older than 18. Since you guys might know someone, I’ll add that she was a blond with brown eyes. She was wearing the same blue shirt and jeans as earlier, so she was definitely the person who got me.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked, my detective instincts kicking in. “Are you connected to Body Mary?”\n\n“Connected to?” she smirked. “I am Body Mary.”\n\nI stared at her stupendously. At her age? She barely even looked threatening. Hell, she reminded me of my daughter!\n\n“But, why? How, and why, are you doing all of this?” I asked, wanting to know as much as possible.\n\nShe sighed. “Is what I’m doing a crime? All I’m doing is cleaning the shit out of our society! And where they were useless in life, I repurposed them to be useful after their deaths!”\n\nLooking at my shocked expression, she said, “Let’s start from the beginning.”\n\n“A year ago, a classmate told me to meet him at a place not far from here. Like the naive idiot I was, I met him. Turns out, he and four grown men were there to take advantage of me. I tried to fight back, pleaded so much, even begged them to leave me alone. And they didn’t hear or care about anything. Nothing at all! They pinned me down and had their way as I screamed in anguish. And the worst part is, no one listened! No matter how I tried to speak out for myself, warn others, tried to do something about it, no one believed me! For how dare I accuse those *esteemed* men of doing anything!”\n\n“And that’s when I learnt something. This world, our society, only trembles at might. It only looks to those in power, only bends to the words and actions of the influential. And for power, for a straight path up, one must step on every neck they can. For that is the only thing that matters. Ruthlessness above all!”, she growled, pressing her arms into a fist.\n\n“Instead, I took matters into my own hands. I took to arms. I searched neighbourhoods, buildings, alleys, everywhere. I stalked these men and slowly hatched a plot. And finally, I gutted them like the filthy pigs they were!”, she snarled.\n\n“I eventually found the last two in an ice factory. And that’s when I got the idea of using out their organs. They were rotten pigs in life, but in death they could be so much more. I dumped their bodies in giant vats of ice, and nicked some preserving fluid from a nearby hospital to keep those organs saleable. Who would find a petite sixteen-year-old suspicious, right?”\n\n“That was not some preserving fluid, you stole 6 gallons!”, I countered. While I wasn’t directly involved in the investigation, word got around the station about this rather unusual case. I expected it to go on sale on the black market, though.\n\nShe tched dismissively. “It wasn’t much, anyways. I got people to bring them around for me, anyways! Now, listen!”\n\n“After a few days of asking around at the port, I got someone. A middleman who would buy my organs and distribute them. I sold everything I could cut out of them, and dumped their bodies in the ocean.”\n\nI vaguely remembered a case from around 10 months ago, of hacked-apart bodies washing up on the shores of Jamaica Bay. So that, too, was her doing?\n\n“I shoved my cash in a corner of the shithole I called my room, which was a mistake. One day, my asshole alcoholic stepdad found the money. It was MY money, but HE spent it all on drugs and alcohol. And when I protested, he laid his filthy hands on me!”\n\n“I skewered him with a kitchen knife and sold every bit that wasn’t rotting away from his addictions.”\n\n“Ok, uh, a bit faster?”, I asked. I didn’t have patience for monologues, even incriminating ones.\n\n“Whatever. Next, I found that the dealer was ripping me off. The real market value was TWENTY TIMES what he paid me! And if I let that go on, that would make me a weakling! A doormat!”\n\n“So, I met up with him one day. The next day, I sold his bits to his partners. And I expanded my network more and more, employing scouts to check out people undeserving of life. The thugs, abusers and drug dealers of society. We would stalk them, see if their organs would be worth anything with their medical data and lifestyles. Eventually, my competitors ended up the same way, cut up to bits and sold for millions. I have to be RUTHLESS, to maintain this lifestyle and my bottomless profits. I have this down to a process now. My money reaches places you’ll never believe, and my goods are in demand everywhere! Now how will you get me?”, she explained.\n\n“Natasha died a long time ago. And Body Mary was born, out of her ashes.”\n\n“Nice story,” I said. “But why am I here?”\n\n“At first, I wanted to exchange you for Abdul,” she sighed.\n\nI remembered him. We busted him in a raid at the port a month ago, and roughed him up for intel. He was a loyal right-hand man to Body Mary, but we got out some vital information that helped me get this far. Even if it ended in me being tied onto an uncomfortable, rickety chair.  In particular, I remembered one line he said.\n\n“For her, money and power are her only gods. Therefore, \\[LOCATION REDACTED\\] is her Jannah.”, he divulged between ragged breaths. That was how I got around to locating the pharmacy in the area, and meeting Body Mary.\n\n“However, I realised you pigs wouldn’t just give him up. So, I had other plans.”, she explained.\n\n“See this?”, she asked, waving a little film photo in front of me. My stomach dropped as I immediately recognised the person in the photo.\n\n“A- Ana? What did you do to her! I won’t let you go!”, I screamed as I wrestled with the bonds holding me.\n\nShe snorted at my outburst. “For you, since she’s your darling daughter, Ana. Personally, I prefer ‘that bitch Anastasia’.”\n\n“Remember the guy who duped me into getting raped?”\n\nI gulped and nodded, beads of sweat forming on my forehead. \n\n“There’s a reason I haven’t mentioned him yet. Traitors like him deserve the worst end one can provide.”\n\nShe dug into her pocket and pulled out a small vacuum pack of some powder. \n\n“See this?” she pointed. “Just one dose, orally taken, keeps the consumer wide awake for days. Whatever happens to them. Give that dickhead a bit of this, and he’ll stay alive and screaming for days in eternal pain as I slowly cut out every bit of him. Oh, and he won’t bleed out, because that’s too quick.”\n\nMy eyes were wide with horror at that point. I saw some pretty grisly things in my career, but this was hitting a little too close to home.\n\n“I don’t care! What about my daughter?”, I yelled at her.\n\n“Oh, don’t want to see anything?”, she said as she shoved some pictures back into her purse. \n\n“Your daughter… she was not supposed to be there. But she was out with that dickhead she called her boyfriend! She made my life absolute hell back in school. No one has made the connection between my meek self in school and Body Mary, but she saw my face when we kidnapped the dumbass! So, off with us she came.”\n\n“Give her back. Now!”, I demanded.\n\n“Ah, you see…”, Mary trailed off as she clasped her hands together. “We did a checkup on her, and sent her organ measurements around. And as it turns out, some Emirati oil gazillionaire’s daughter needs a new heart. And guess who’s measurements fit?”\n\nMy heart sank at this news. For so long, I had held out hope that my precious daughter would be well, but that was proven false. What could I expect?”\n\n“He promised me riches beyond my wildest dreams! Oh, and a tiny share in an oil company. I’ll be set for life, so I suppose I have to thank Romeo and Juliet down there for that.”\n\n“Where’s the police?” I demanded. “You will be stopped!”\n\n“Let’s just say… they were otherwise occupied. Now, bye!” she said as she opened a door built into the wall and walked into an elevator.\n\n“No. Wait!”, I yelled as she disappeared.\n\nA few minutes later, the police broke in to find me tied to the chair, sobbing profusely like a five-year-old child. Afterwards, no matter how hard I tried, I could never find her or my daughter.\n\nThis is a case that I never want to recall, but one that I’m forced to remember. Does anyone know where she is now? Despite retiring ages ago, I still want to know what she’s doing now. So, can you guys on the forum please help me out?\n\n[X](https://reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites)",

        "text": "# The Salted Desperation of a Powerless Soul\n\n**A strange sound.** As if something is calling me from the depths of a dark abyss. Opening my eyes I am overcome by a thick, green liquid that is slithering out from the walls and floors of my apartment.\n\nIt is alive, creeping around my furniture like an unyielding monster, leaving a slimy, sticky residue in its wake. It is a sight of horror, like something from a nightmare, a swamp full of toxic waste that has come alive. The liquid is dark and murky, swirling around my belongings, slowly devouring them one by one.\n\nMy shock quickly turns to panic. The liquid is hungry and determined. It has already taken my brocade sofa, and my ebony coffee table is quickly succumbing to its fearsome suckerage.\n\nParalysed. Unable to think of a way to stop it. I run to my window and cry \"HELP! HELP! WON'T ANYBODY HELP!\"\n\nMy lament is lost in the still quiet of the night. I am desperately alone, and the liquid continues to gain strength. My heart pounds in my chest and my mind races as I try to find a way to save what I hold dear.\n\nDespair is creeping in, threatening to consume me like the liquid is consuming my home. I am lost and alone, desperate for a way to combat this relentless force. The liquid moves forward, taking and devouring everything in its path, and I am left with nothing but a feeling of helplessness.\n\nIn my moment of desperation, I reach deep within and locate a gumption, a determination to stand up in my bed-things, to raise my delicate fists and fight. I lock my gaze onto the liquid and I know that I must act, must take control of the situation. Its hunger is evident, an insatiable beast that will consume everything I love.\n\nThe cupboards and closets of my apartment are near empty, my eyes darting around the room. Then I see it. Salt. I snatch up the container of salt and my heart races with excitement. I quickly pour a line of salt around the edges of the room, creating a barrier between the liquid and my belongings.\n\nMy adrenaline is pumping as I watch the liquid slowly retreat and hide in the corners of the room. I feel a rush of triumph. My plan is working. I add more salt to the perimeter, enclosing the liquid in a tight circle. I smile in satisfaction as I watch it slowly become powerless, its hunger quelled by my barrier of protection.\n\nFor the first time since this nightmare began, I am filled with hope. I had found a way to contain the liquid and protect my things. I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that I had found a solution to this problem. I have conquered this relentless force, and I can now rest peacefully knowing my home is safe.\n\nThe power I have wielded fills me with awe, the strength I have found within myself. I have fought off the green liquid and saved my precious possessions, but the feeling of dread and despair still lingers deep within me. The sharp blade of panic still slices through me, and I know that this is only the beginning.\n\nThe mysterious liquid may still be there, multiplying and growing in size and strength. I can feel its hunger, like a living thing that is determined to consume all that stands in its way. I am filled with a sudden, overwhelming fear. I know that I must stay vigilant, that I must remain ever-watchful of the enemy that threatens to overtake me.",

        "text": "I met Alice on one of my business trips to California, she was just something else. She was a woman whose spirit could befriend you before you could ever go to her beauty, but even so, she was dead-drop gorgeous. She was kind, and somehow when I spent my time with her, I felt free, like something was holding me, and she was the only one who could free me. Not only that, but she was always keen to do new things, and nothing stopped her. Even when she was afraid, she never showed it and smiled and did whatever had to be done. I remember how I was afraid of skydiving and was against it, but she somehow managed to make me agree, and we even ended up doing it together. She was just something else…she always said that *the life we live is short, so stop doubting yourself and start living…* \n\nThat was then and now, I am writing this from my own basement where I locked myself till my wife's best mother arrives so that at least someone can believe what I am going through. My wife is still weeping in the room where I locked her before she tries to escape and kill me…again. I can hear her screams and bang, but I am too afraid. \n\nIt all started with that damn party, I don't clearly remember, but I will try to detail whatever happened before and after that party. So last year, my wife was invited to a party her boss hosted at her house. My wife is a writer, and she works for a magazine, but her skill set is rather wide, she is a photographer, editor artist, and a bright chef, so I was always proud of her. She was a famous figure in the whole office after Lisa (her boss) so she was supposed to be the life of the party. (Also, I would like to clarify we were married for 7 years, and we never fought, seriously and just had a perfect understanding, and she used to look at me with teddy eyes whenever I was angry or frustrated. I used to forget whatever I felt just by looking at her. I just loved her. Somehow I still do…) We went to the party and everyone greeted her, everyone had respect or admiration in their eyes whenever they saw Alice, so I was happy for her. She went to greet the boss while I was supposed to go to the restroom when I heard glass shatter, which was not supposed to be a big deal, but then I heard a kid crying and heard Alice's voice. I went down to see what happened, the glass pieces were on Alice's hand and blood was running down, but the kid panicked and started crying, Alice was still hugging him calming him down.\n\nI rushed down to Alice, and we left early from the party to get her to the hospital, the cut wasn't too deep and after a proper wrapping from the doctor we were on our way home. I was still thinking about her kindness and her expression calming the kid and looking at me and smiling while shrugging, I kissed her when we got home. We took things to bed pretty soon and were sleeping after a few hours when I heard someone weeping I woke up and saw that Alice wasn't there, so I went downstairs in a hurry to see where she was when I saw her looking from the window towards the moon. The moonlight falling on her made her look…pale immediately like she didn't have blood running in her. I went to her and hugged her from behind, calling her name out, but even her eyes were white. Her iris was…not there I immediately took a step back and pulled her from the moonlight and there suddenly her skin became lively again and her iris came back and her tears stopped. She was thirsty so I gave her water but she still wasn't able to speak for a few minutes so we sat down she slept in my arms so I slept on the sofa too.\n\nThe next day was normal and I didn't focus too much on the previous night and Alice too was smiling again and was normal so we went to work as usual and returned in the evening nothing strange then too so we took dinner and went to sleep. It was cloudy that day as I checked before hitting the bed but once again at 2:09 I heard a child weeping we didn't have a child yet so I was surprised my wife was missing from the bed so I went downstairs. Alice was again looking at the sky from our window and moonlight was falling on her, her skin white as ice and no iris in her eyes but this time she was hugging herself and was crying watching the moon. I called her out but she didn't hear, I tried pulling but she didn't move an inch. It was almost like she became a statue there. Now I am a regular reader here on r/nosleep so I was well aware of things that could happen. So I sat on my sofa to observe before taking any actions. I sat there in utter silence just the moonlight falling from a window and my wife weeping...\n\nShe cried till 3 and just sat there against the wall her head between her knees and elbows crossed. She stopped weeping now so I approached her to enquire her of her sudden actions but when I touched her she was burning, not like someone with fever, but she was literally burning. I could see her pale skin vibrating...it was her blood boiling but after touching her, she looked up this time her eyes were full black like the iris took the whole space and her pale skin was somewhat a little reddish, she broke the vas near her and started to stab the window with the glass. I was confused at first but then I saw my reflection in the window, she was stabbing at my reflection, and that too on the hand of my reflection, the same spot where she got the cut at the party. I filled the glass of water and threw it at her, the water immediately turned to steam when it touched her skin and she fell down. I picked her up and carried her to the bedroom. She was perfectly asleep. I sat on the bed searching for psychiatrists as well as paranormal experts. The next morning she didn't remember what happened and refused to seek medical help as she said she was feeling fit and fine. \n\nI requested her and seeing my concern she agreed after a few minutes, we went to the psychiatrist and I explained to her everything, every word of my mouth seemed like a shock to Alice, and in the end, she became speechless. The doctor prescribed medicine for a night of proper sleep and told us that this might be the result of the shock from the incident at the party but she couldn't explain her deep black or white eyes. That night went out in peace Alice was asleep but I was awake to see what exactly happened to her although her skin did turn white at 2:09 she was still asleep and soon the sun came out. After a few nights, she started to sleep without any changes in her even at 2:09 and that's when one night I slept too I heard a weep but this time loud and near me, I woke up to turn but Alice was sitting on top of me glaring at me with those white eyes and the moonlight fell on her this time too, her skin white and she titled her head a little she had a glass piece in her hand, she was weeping but this time the smile which she flashed at me while hugging the kid at the party that same smile was plastered on her face. That smile back then was of sympathy but this time it sent a chill down my spine she now started to look at my hand and when she was about to stab my hand I picked up the lamp near my bed and smashed at her head and pushed her, she was still like a stone but the smash at her head might've made her shaky so I was able to push her off and run down while locking her to call her mother to inquire about whether she had this sort of behavior in the past...but I am not afraid of her actions I am rather afraid of the smile she flashed before I locked her in our bedroom...",

        "text": "Yesterday was my 15th birthday. Since my mom allowed me to stay home, I was excited for the day that was ahead of me. My Father would've also been a month sober yesterday. It isn't an incredibly long time, but we were so proud of him for quitting cold turkey. We don't like Father when he's drunk. He gets cruel. \n\nTo commemorate these two events, we all planned to go to dinner last night at a nice restaurant; Mom, Father, Cora and I. Everything was going amazingly, but when I woke up in the morning, I found a strange note on my bedside table. Wiping the sleep from my groggy eyes, I blithely peeled the note from the table and got to reading.\n\n*Happy birthday, Lia. I'm so sorry that you have to spend your special day like this, but I have to cut straight to the chase. You're not safe. At least, you're not safe while you're in the house. You must listen VERY carefully to what's written here. PLEASE I BEG OF YOU.\n\nYour Father got laid off of his job yesterday. He wouldn't tell me how or why. But, he started drinking, very, VERY heavily because of it. You know how he gets when he's drunk. You're not safe while you're in the same house of him. You have to get out before he gets to you. Please heed these rules. It's the only way you'll make it out unharmed.\n\n1. Don't look for me. By the time you're reading this note, I'm already gone. I'm sorry that I didn't have the chance to get you and Cora, but there was no other choice.\n\n2. As you know, Cora will come home at 14:50. No matter what, don't try to save her. It sounds cruel, but there's nothing you can do to help her, you'll only get hurt along with her. She'll scream out for you, but don't respond. Wait until the thrashing and squealing stops before proceeding.\n\n3. DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE. If you do make noise, your Father will walk up the stairs and come into your room. You don't want him in your room.\n\n3a. In the case you do, for whatever reason, make a noise, HIDE UNDER YOUR BED IMMEDIATELY. He won't be able to reach you under there. Don't come out until you hear him walk back down the stairs. DON'T TRY TO ATTACK HIM. Cora's a fighter, so your Father will be disoriented, but don't think that you can overpower him. You can't. \n\n3b. If you're unable to hide underneath your bed in time, I'm so sorry, baby. It'll be extremely painful, but it'll be over before you know it.\n\n4. Don't jump out your window. You'll be right in front of the screen door when you fall, and your Father will see you. It'll be hard to run with twisted ankles.\n\n4a. If your window is closed, do not open your window for any reason. Refer to rule 9a.\n\n5. Don't go downstairs for ANY REASON. Your Father's threats are completely empty. He won't be able to harm you if you don't follow his voice.\n\n6. Don't use your phone to make any calls unless you've successfully escaped. If you use your phone in the house, refer to 3a.\n\n7. Your Father should be on the TV watching a sports game. You have a higher chance of escaping when he's distracted by it. If the TV is on any other channel, don't move. He's listening for your movement.\n\n7a. If he's paused the TV entirely, he's looking for you. Refer to rules 3 and 3a.\n\n8. Keeping all of the previous rules in mind, slowly and silently head to me and your Father's room. Close the door and lock it behind you. It'll buy you a few seconds if you're too loud. However, you must be very careful once you're here. You will not be able to hide in time.\n\n9. The window in the bedroom should already be open. If it's not, DO NOT OPEN IT. Refer to rule 9b.\n\n9a. All of the openings in our house are alarmed. Always remember that.\n\n9b. Go to the upstairs bathroom, close the door and pray. I'm so sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you. If he leaves the house, you're safe to go. If he finds you, don't resist. It'll only make it worse.\n\n10. If the window is open, there should be a latter right outside of it. This is how I escaped. VERY CAREFULLY, AS TO NOT MAKE A SOUND, climb down the latter. Once you're down, run. Only then can you call the police. Your Father will be on the other side of the house, so he won't hear you.\n\n10a. You may see Cora's body on the yard while you're running. She may look alive, but she's already dead. DO NOT GO NEAR HER.\n\n11. Go straight to the neighbor's house and tell them your predicament. They will immediately let you in and keep you safe.\n\nI am so, so sorry Lia. I'm sorry for all of this. Cora's in a much better place now, and I will find you, no matter what it takes. Your Father will not harm us anymore. I love you so, so, so, so much. Happy 15th birthday.*",

        "text": "Sorry for posting this so late, but it took me a while to find somewhere I could hide. A place that no one else could get hurt.\n\nI first noticed the light one day when I was in school.\n\nI was working on a classwork assignment for math, struggling to figure out how to do a problem. All of a sudden, a light shone on my paper, illuminating my work.\n\nUsually our teacher kept the lights off in the classroom, only allowing small string lights to light up the room. But when I looked up, no one else had noticed the new light turn on. That's when I realized that the light was coming from directly behind my head.\n\nI turned around to see it, but there was nothing else. Only a faint light coming from somewhere in the back of the room. I didn't pay much attention to it. I thought maybe it was something in the wall, a reflection, or even my mind paying tricks on me.\n\nIt was a few days before I noticed it again.\n\nIt was at night, and I had a friend over from school. Her name was Lanae, and we had been in school together ever since we were in kindergarten. Life had gotten busier for both of us, so we didn't get a chance to hang out as much as we used to. But luckily today we had a day off due to the snow, and since she lived close by she was able to come over.\n\nToday, we were playing a video game on Lanae's new Switch that she got for her birthday. I never had one, and when I found out she did I was ecstatic to have her over. For hours into the night we played various different games, including Mario Kart and Mario Party. I really liked Mario Kart even though I wasn't as good as her.\n\nEverything was going smoothly. During one game I was really close to winning. I was right about to take a shortcut off of one of the pathways that Lanae had shown me, but right as I was about to make the jump a flash of light illuminated the room, momentarily blinding me.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" I yelled out, throwing the controller down to the floor as I rubbed my eyes.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nLanae had paused the game and was looking at me.\n\n\"That flash, it blinded me.\" I looked to the screen noticing that my character had fallen over the edge of the map and was in the middle of being lifted back up to the track. So much for winning.\n\n\"What flash?\"\n\nI turned to her, twisting my head in confusion. \"Didn't you see that flash? It was so bright. It filled the whole room.\"\n\nShe turned back towards the screen, but I could see a flash of concern on her face. We continued playing for another hour, but I couldn't really concentrate anymore.\n\nHow could she not see it? Did she do that because she saw I was about to win?\n\nI shook my head at the thought. Her character had still been moving on the bottom of the screen, so I didn't know how she could use her phone to create a flash while also playing. Plus, we were sitting next to each other. I feel like I definitely would have noticed her.\n\nLanae excused herself to go to the bathroom, so I took my chance. I turned my head backwards slightly, trying to see if there was anything behind me. On the gray wall of my bedroom, there was a small yellow dot in the top corner.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nI strained my head, trying to get a better look. Was it a bug or something? It didn't seem to be moving at all. I was about to stand up to examine it further, but Lanae returned. We finished a few more games, but all I could think about was that dot on the wall. \n\nWhen she finally left, I stood up to inspect it. Every time I tried to touch it, the light would disappear. But when I removed my hand, there it would be again.\n\nI looked around my room, finding a piece of paper and a roll of tape. I folded the paper several times over itself and taped it up against the wall. Satisfied that the light was completely covered, I got ready for bed and fell asleep shortly after.\n\nI woke up, rubbing my eyes. Had it already been morning? I grabbed my phone. 1:43 AM.\n\nThat's when I realized that the light wasn't coming from the window. In fact, it was still completely dark outside. I looked up above my bed. The light was shining through the paper and illuminating my bed.\n\n\"Hey honey, have you been feeling okay? You've been looking tired the past couple of days.\" I looked up to see my mom looking over at me from the opposite side of the table.\n\n\"Yeah mom, I'm fine. Things are just getting a little busy at school.\" This was a lie, but otherwise I didn't know what else to say to her. How was I supposed to tell her that a mysterious light had been following me wherever I went? No one else seemed to notice it.\n\nShe didn't even seem to notice it now, with the light shining directly on to her face.\n\n\"Okay, well if there's anything I can do to help…\"\n\n\"Thanks mom.\"\n\nShe grabbed our plates form the table, walking behind me to set them in the kitchen sink. I heard a gasp from behind me. I turned around to see her staring at the back of my neck, wide-eyed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nShe stepped forward, holding her hand out to touch my neck. It burned.\n\n\"Ow, what was that?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but have you been outside a lot recently? It looks like you have some sort of… sunburn on the back of your neck.\"\n\nSunburn?\n\nI reach around to the back of my neck, feeling the skin flake beneath my fingers. Was this from the light? It's not like I had been outside much recently, and even if I had been the skies had always been cloudly recently. There wasn't much sun at this time of the year. \n\n\"We should take you to the doctor's office right now. This burn looks really bad.\"\n\nI wanted to argue, but I didn't know what to say. Maybe the doctor would be able to help. Or at least tell me I wasn't going crazy.\n\nThe drive to the doctor's took less than half an hour, and luckily not too many people are in the waiting room. When they finally called my name, my mom walked me up to the front desk.\n\n\"I'll be right here when you come out.\"\n\nAfter the nurse brought me to the room, I felt the hair standing on the back of my neck. Somehow, I knew that the light was still there with me. I didn't know how bright it was in the brightly lit doctor's room, but it was there.\n\n\"Hello Jin, it's so nice to see you today. How is everything going?\"\n\n\"Things are going well.\"\n\n\"Your mom tells me that she's worried about some kind of rash or skin issue on the back of your neck? Can I take a look?\"\n\nI turned my head around so that my back was facing her. There it was. It's faint, but it's right there on the middle of the wall.\n\nAfter I felt her hands leave my neck, I turned back towards her.\n\n\"When did you first start noticing this happen?\"\n\n\"I don't know, not until today at least.\"\n\n\"Today? Were you outside a lot recently?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Do you go to tanning salons or something similar?\"\n\nI shook my head again. I wanted to tell her what was happening, but what if she didn't believe me? Or what if she thought I was crazy and had me sent away somewhere?\n\n\"I mean, looking at this it looks like a classic case of sunburn. Too much sunlight. I just don't understand how this would happen at this time of the year.\"\n\nShe looked up from his clipboard, eyebrow raised at me. \"Do you have any other ideas about how this could have happened?\"\n\nI paused for a few moments, before finally deciding. \"I'm not sure, but I've been seeing this light.\"\n\n\"Light?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it started a few weeks ago, but there seems to be this bright light following me around. I've seen it on -\"\n\nBefore I could finish, Doctor Paisley had pushed up from her seat and backed up against the wall. I stood up, holding my hand up towards her. \"What's going -\"\n\n\"You need to leave, right now.\"\n\n\"Wait, but I thought -\"\n\nBut she had already opened the door and ran out of the room, leaving me standing dumbfounded. What was going on?\n\nI turned back to the light on the wall. It seemed brighter now.\n\nAfter a few weeks of this, I started to learn to live with the light. I started wearing a scarf all the time to cover up the back of my neck, and whenever I slept I always used a eye mask or covered my face with a pillow. It didn't completely block out the light, but it helped.\n\nI was walking towards the library. Lanae and I were supposed to meet up to work on a group project for our History class, and we needed some extra time outside of school to meet. With the constant light on me and anything in front of me, I was having trouble working at a fast enough pace during class.\n\nI saw Lanae sitting on the steps leading up to the library, typing away on her phone. It was hard to see her from this far, but I yelled out to her to get her attention.\n\nWhen she looked up, I gasped, dropping my phone and book to the ground.\n\nHer face looked… different.\n\nThe skin on her face looked red and inflamed, and some of it was even peeling off. She noticed that I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, and started to walk towards me. As she got closer, her facial features became even more visible.\n\nAnd it looked even worse than I first thought.\n\nA few feet away and now I can see that the skin on her face has started to peel off enough that long, flaps of skin were hanging off of her cheeks. Long flaps dragged down from her forehead, partially covering her eyes. On her nose, I could even see exposed bone.\n\n\"Hey Jin!\" She smiled at me, waving her hand back and forward.\n\nHow can she act as if everything was fine?\n\nNow that she was close up, the light behind my head shined even brighter on her face. I watched in horror as the flap on her cheek peeled off, falling down to the floor.\n\nHer gaze followed mine, and she looked down at the same spot where her skin had fallen to.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" She looked back up at me, curiousity filling her face.\n\n\"I… uh, nothing. How are you doing? Are you feeling fine?\"\n\nShe looked from side to side, tightening her hood on her jacket around her face.\n\n\"It's been getting a little too cold for me, but other than that I'm good! Are you ready to get started on the project?\"\n\nWhat was I supposed to do? Was this all part of my imagination? She seemed fine even though she didn't look fine.\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nAfter we checked in at the front desk of the library, we made our way to one of the conference rooms in the back. I took out my notebook and pencil, trying to ignore everything that was going on with my friend. \n\nI wanted to say something, but what was I supposed to say? Hey, don't you notice your face is falling apart? She would have thought I was going crazy.\n\nMaybe I am. That would be the only thing that could explain what was happening.\n\nI blinked a few times, trying to read the information she was writing on the whiteboard. I think she was trying to schedule out what we could do next, but the intensity of the light was growing. The glare from the whiteboard blinded me, and I struggled to keep my eyes open.\n\n\"Hey, are you doing okay?\"\n\nLanae reached forward with her dried, inflamed arm. Now it was puffed up from all the light that it was nearly twice the size it was before. I flinched from her touch.\n\n\"If you're not feeling well, do you want to meet up another time instead?\"\n\nI was about to decline when I saw her hand and the rest of the room start to light up even brighter. Now the light was completely filling the entire room. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I couldn't see for a few seconds. When the light finally died down, I wiped away at my eyes with my sleeve.\n\nThere Lanae was, standing right in front of me. Her arm was reached forward still, face twisted. But instead of her arm reaching out towards me, it looked like it had been ripped from her elbow. I screamed. Her wrist and hand were shriveled up on the table, nearly burnt to a crisp.\n\n\"Jin, what's going -\"\n\nBefore she could finish I was already shoving my way out the door. I didn't even stop to say anything to the librarian, who had overheard the commotion from the conference room. I couldn't be around anyone right now.\n\nI ran all the way back toward my house. I didn't want to stop. I couldn't stop. I didn't know what would happen if I did.\n\nThe light started to shine brightly as I made my way through the rest of town. In my confusion and haste I failed to notice an older man standing in the middle of the sidewalk.\n\n\"Sorry!\" I yelled out as I shoved my way past him. I heard him fall to the ground and heard a loud pop. I desperately wanted to turn back and see how he was doing. But I couldn't.\n\nI felt an arm grab my by the shoulder, twisting me around. A younger woman was glaring at me.\n\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?\"\n\nI looked back to see a small crowd had gathered around the old man on the floor. His cane had snapped in half, and he was grabbing at his hip.\n\n\"I'm sorry I just really need to -\"\n\n\"Look at what you did! How can you be so reckless. And to try to run away like nothing happened?\"\n\nI tried jerking my arm away from her grasp, but her grip on me was too tight. \"Please, I really need to -\"\n\n\"No, you need to stay here and wait for the police. Someone's already called them and they're on their way.\"\n\n\"Please, you don't understand!\" The light started to get even brighter now. Brighter than it had been in the library. When I could finally see again, I stared in horror with my mouth wide.\n\nThe woman and the people that were behind her were all gone. All that remained were the charred bones. The snow around them had melted, leaving the bones floating in a puddle of water. The only thing that remained at my feet were ashes.\n\nI brought my hands up to my face, and I couldn't stop them from shaking. They were reddened and burnt, but I couldn't feel any pain.\n\nI ran. I ran without stopping all the way back to my house. I didn't know where else to go, but I had to go somewhere where no one else would be.",

        "text": "The apartment I live in at the moment has very thin walls, and I happen to live on the floor just below the top. Any loud noise made by anyone above or below you, as long as you're in the same room, may easily be heard from the distance of one story away. A few weeks into 2022, on one fateful night, I was pooping in the bathroom as usual, and then my ears caught the voice of my upper floor neighbour. This neighbour was a woman in her late 20s who I believe lives alone and, based on the way she dresses when I see her in the mornings, works some kind of office job. The time was around 1 AM, I think she was on the phone with her boyfriend that night, speaking quietly, and it was hard to make much of what she was saying. I began to listen so I'd have something I could focus on other than that there was literally stuff coming out of my ass, but as I said, all of my diligent efforts fell feeble. However, at one point, raising her voice several octaves above her whispering tone, she yelled, “Why did you break your promise, huh, why did you? Didn’t you promise me?” before returning once again to a quiet whisper. After a few minutes, right after I had finished pooping, I started to hear sounds of laughing. It was a strange sound, coming after all the silent talking and all that. I was getting cold since I don’t turn the central heating on for the bathroom, but this whole event was kind of like watching a romance anime happen in real life, so I was starting to take a further interest in the entire ordeal. Up until that moment I was only listening as an outsider, she was just the company I picked for myself during my ritual, my pooping time, however, at that very moment I felt that I had to involve myself in the situation one way or another. I wiped my ass. And then, closing the toilet lid, with my bare butt exposed, I climbed up on top of the toilet, trying to stand on the edges of the toilet on the tip of my foot fingers, balancing myself. From there, standing atop my porcelain throne, I could hear her more clearly. It was then that I realized she was not laughing, but rather, crying. “Enough, I don’t want to hear more of this” she said, keeping up her crying. What followed was a  “Didn’t I tell you the plans I had made for February 14 and you accepted them?” ....  \"It was going to be our first valentine day together.\" When I realized what was going on, I nearly burst laughing at that moment, but I barely managed to contain it. I had initially thought he cheated on her or something like that and wouldn’t have expected her to cry over something extremely menial, especially since she gave me the vibe of an independent, strong woman, staying alone, working all by herself. But I guess reality is not fiction. I assume that that she hung up at some point around that as she stopped talking and I didn’t hear anything from her but her silent crying. I listened to her sobbing for like 5 minutes, and it sounded better than classical music to my ears. I enjoyed every second of it. But you know, even dessert starts to taste overwhelming when you eat too much. Then I flushed, my toilet made an obnoxiously loud sound, and her crying stopped.",

        "text": "Are you tired of feeling the chills run down your spine as you read through the horror stories on this subreddit? Do you find yourself constantly looking over your shoulder, expecting the monsters from the stories to jump out at you? I understand your fear, for I too have been a victim of the terrifying tales on r/nosleep. But I have found a way to hide from them, or so I thought.\n\nIt all started when I came across a post in r/nosleep, it was a story about a man who discovered a way to hide from the horrors of the subreddit. At first, I was skeptical, but as someone who has been haunted by the stories on R/Nosleep for far too long, I was desperate for a solution to my fears. The story outlined several steps that one could take to hide from the scares of r/nosleep. I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe first step was to avoid reading the stories late at night or in the dark. I found that reading the stories in the daylight, or in well-lit rooms, made them seem less realistic and less scary. The second step was to take breaks from reading the stories altogether. I set a limit for myself on how many stories I would read in a day or a week, and I made sure to stick to it. The third step was not to read the comments. I found that sometimes the comments can be just as terrifying as the stories themselves. The final step was to distract myself with other activities such as watching a funny show or movie, reading a different subreddit, or spending time with friends and family.\n\nTo my surprise, these steps worked. I was able to read r/nosleep without being consumed by fear and nightmares. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I decided to share my newfound knowledge with others on the subreddit, hoping to help them overcome their fear as well. But as more and more people began to use these methods to hide from the scares of r/nosleep, something strange began to happen.\n\nThe stories on the subreddit started to change. They became more terrifying, more realistic, and the fear they invoked was stronger than ever before.

        "text": "\nAre you tired of feeling the chills run down your spine as you read through the horror stories on this subreddit? Do you find yourself constantly looking over your shoulder, expecting the monsters from the stories to jump out at you? I understand your fear, for I too have been a victim of the terrifying tales on R/Nosleep. But I have found a way to hide from them, or so I thought.\n\nIt all started when I came across a post in R/Nosleep, it was a post about a man who discovered a way to hide from the horrors of the subreddit. At first, I was skeptical, but as someone who has been haunted by the stories on R/Nosleep for far too long, I was desperate for a solution to my fears. The story outlined several steps that one could take to hide from the scares of R/Nosleep. I decided to give it a try.\nThe first step was to avoid reading the stories late at night or in the dark. I found that reading the stories in the daylight, or in well-lit rooms, made them seem less realistic and less scary. The second step was to take breaks from reading the stories altogether. I set a limit for myself on how many stories I would read in a day or a week, and I made sure to stick to it. The third step was not to read the comments. I found that sometimes the comments can be just as terrifying as the stories themselves. The final step was to distract myself with other activities such as watching a funny show or movie, reading a different subreddit, or spending time with friends and family.\nTo my surprise, these steps worked. I was able to read R/Nosleep without being consumed by fear and nightmares. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I decided to share my newfound knowledge with others on the subreddit, hoping to help them overcome their fear as well. But as more and more people began to use these methods to hide from the scares of R/Nosleep, something strange began to happen.\nThe stories on the subreddit started to change. They became more terrifying, more realistic, and the fear they invoked was stronger than ever before. I couldn't understand it, I thought I had found a way to hide from the scares, but instead, they seemed to have grown stronger. I started to notice that the stories seemed to be about things that I had been afraid of, things that I had tried to hide from. I couldn't shake the feeling that the stories were somehow connected to me, and the more I tried to hide from them, the stronger they became.\nIt was then that I realized the true horror of R/Nosleep: the stories are not just works of fiction, they are a manifestation of our fears and anxieties.

It was a long and quiet ride back out to his ranch, with neither of us taking the initiative to speak. I couldn’t believe he’d been responsible for what happened at the Hatchet facility.\n\nAs soon as the car was parked, I was halfway out the door. John put a hand on my shoulder.\n\n“Wait,” he said. “Please.”\n\nI’m not usually that hesitant, but that ‘please’ stopped me dead in my tracks. Without a word, I stayed in the car.\n\n“You don’t know what those people are like,” he continued. “You don’t know what they’re capable of.”\n\n“Because you’re not telling me shit,” I scoffed. “What the hell even happened? Where’ve you been?”\n\n“When you get to the point where I’m at, everything just looks… dark,” he said. “Problems seem insurmountable, and you start to realize how badly the odds are stacked against you. When you came here, I just hoped to spare you that vision.”\n\n“Fine.”\n\nI stepped out, and John followed suit. Leaning against the car, he called out as I walked away.\n\n“I’ll show you,” he sighed. “Just… don’t let it kill you.”\n\nI thought about it while he went back inside. I stayed in the car, taking a deep breath and charging my phone for a bit. The screen flickered, and there was this little burst of sound; like the static burst of a walkie-talkie.\n\nStrange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed John inside; past the posters of the projects he’d worked on. It felt strange walking back into the workshop. It felt darker, and bigger. Maybe it was my image of him that’d changed.\n\nJohn slumped down into his creaking computer chair and turned on his homemade setup. Strange operating systems written in seemingly random patterns, powered by raw and unprotected wiring hanging from the ceiling. To the average person, John’s workshop was just as nightmarish as ever.\n\n“When I worked at Hatchet, we refined a metal called Blameless,” he sighed. “We refined it from the same stuff I pulled out of your veins.”\n\n“Yeah, I got some questions about that.”\n\n“Either way, it has some strange properties. You can make all kinds of components with it. Some of this stuff is made of it.”\n\nHe gestured around the room without looking away from his screen. I noticed some symbols moving on the screen without him touching the keyboard.\n\n“But you can’t trust it,” John continued. “You can’t trust anything it makes.”\n\n“So why are you working with it?”\n\nHe pulled down his sunglasses, showing me his strange red eyes. Even the shape looked odd, now that I got a closer look.\n\n“There’s not much more it can do to me. Hatchet saw to that.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn tapped a single key on his keyboard, and the screens started to flicker. There were no folders, tabs, icons, or anything; just an ever-changing landscape of symbols.\n\n“This is Blameless,” John said, pointing at the screen. “No need for introductions. She knows who you are.”\n\n“You sure?”\n\n“Yeah,” John nodded. “She basically lives on the internet. Hell, I can’t imagine the internet without her. She knows pretty much everything about you there is to know.”\n\n“And you can see that there? In that?”\n\n“No, this is just… her,” sighed John. “Like a self-portrait.”\n\nCode flowing across the screen like waves. Symbols resembling hieroglyphs rather than letters. It felt like looking out at a landscape of green sand across a black ocean. I couldn’t see anyone, or anything, there.\n\n“There’s nothing there,” I said. “Where is she?”\n\n“She’s all of it. Every little piece of it. She isn’t just a person, or a place. She’s a goddamn force of nature.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn got up and lead me back out in the hall. He pointed at the posters of his old projects.\n\n“We made these using her code,” he said. “And she quickly showed her true colors. She has an agenda, like… a mind of her own. She is living information, like, a… a universal truth being expressed through code. She writes herself, expresses herself, improves herself.”\n\n“Like in Terminator.”\n\n“You’re closer than you think,” nodded John. “So these games? We made the concept, but the games pretty much wrote themselves. Instead of a development cycle where you create everything from scratch, we had Blameless. She made everything for us. It was the difference of rowing across the Atlantic ocean and taking a luxury cruise.”\n\nHe gently touched the poster.\n\n“We never wanted to launch those games. She did. Even sent me these as a thank-you.”\n\nTurning away from the posters, he looked at me.\n\n“I had her in my system for too long, and it messed me up. And if you get too close to this, it’ll mess with you too. So just trust me when I say that no good can come of this.”\n\nI believed him. Despite everything, I believed him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was uncertain if anything would come for me, like in previous months. John assured me that they wouldn’t; that he and Evan had done their best to keep whatever was out there at bay. He explained that there were ways to come back from the other side if you knew where to look. He was seemingly surprised I hadn’t seen Evan yet.\n\nThen again, I might’ve seen him without knowing. He was hard to spot at a distance.\n\nGoing back to my room, I plugged in my phone and peeled off my clothes. I took a long shower and just sunk into the floor. It is amazing just how exhausted you can be without even noticing. I almost fell asleep right then and there, on the bathroom floor.\n\nI could imagine something bursting through the door. Something coming out of the drain. The lights going out, and headless monsters tearing me apart. Being back there, in that room, all this darkness just came flooding back.\n\nI stepped out and collapsed on the bed, seeing a single notification pop up on my phone.\n\n“Don’t trust him.”\n\nAnonymous sender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the time being, there was no better place for me to stay than at John’s. Knowing what was out there, I had to accept that this was pretty much the only person ready and capable of keeping me alive. Trust him or not, it was my best option.\n\nOver the next few days, I got back to helping John in his workshop. Mostly testing cables, but also tearing up old computers for components. I had to use a mouth cover and safety goggles, because there were these internal batteries that could burst if handled improperly.\n\nWe got back into our routine, but John tried to be more open with me. He told me about his work to contain Blameless online, and keeping track of whatever mayhem this… thing, was causing. He told me about his work with tracking and stopping intrusions, and just trying to use what was already out there to finance his work. He had all these little sites that could skim a bit of money here and there; just enough to keep the lights on and make some backroom investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut things weren’t quite as simple. That message that slipped onto my phone worried me, and it wasn’t the last time. Every now and then, a message would pop up on my phone with a little ominous warning. Not every night, and not always the same time, but just often enough to keep me on my toes. Sometimes I’d sit awake and night and just wait for that message to pop up, like I could feel it coming. I got the sense that it knew whan I was waiting for it.\n\nNow, I’m not an idiot. It wasn’t a coincidence that I started getting strange messages just after John introduced me to his work on Blameless. It had to be connected. It had to be a trick. A threat, something to bring me out into the cold.\n\nAnd the Blameless, however she could be described, still managed to crawl into my thoughts. I’d think about that black landscape and the green symbols, weaving back and forth in my mind’s eye. A black ocean with a code-green undulating landscape. It made me wake up nauseous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs August turned to September, I found myself sitting awake one night staring at a particular message. It had dropped just after midnight, and I didn’t know what to make of it. There had been all kinds of subtle messages, like “be careful”, “look out”, or “keep an open mind”. I’d gotten them for weeks. But this was different.\n\n“Ask him where Evan is.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t want to do it. I tried to get it out of my mind. But the truth was, Evan was still missing, and John didn’t seem all too concerned. I watched him on and off for a few days, trying to make sense of what he was doing. All I could tell was that he was working on a website.\n\nOne Thursday night, I couldn’t stop myself. I had to ask. I stopped in the doorway and turned back around.\n\n“So, John, what… do you know where Evan is?”\n\n“No idea,” said John, not looking up from his keyboard.\n\n“You said he was helping you keep things out,” I said. “To keep us safe.”\n\n“Yeah. It’s complicated.”\n\n“I’m just asking where he is.”\n\nJohn turned in his chair, looking at me with unblinking eyes.\n\n“He’s fine. Why are you asking?”\n\n“You don’t seem too eager to get him back,” I said. “That’s, uh… I dunno.”\n\n“He can get back. He’ll be fine.”\n\n“Then why aren’t you telling me where he is?”\n\n“Because it doesn’t matter.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn got out of his chair and walked up to me. I could see his gleaming red eyes straight through his sunglasses.\n\n“I don’t want you running off, putting yourself in danger,” he continued. “I don’t want you to worry.”\n\n“Then just tell me,” I said. “Just tell me what happened, and I’ll be fine.”\n\n“I can’t tell you, because you wouldn’t understand,” John sighed. “You’d freak out. You’d do something dumb.”\n\n“So it’s bad. It’s really bad.”\n\n“No, it’s… “\n\nJohn groaned and buried his face in his hands.\n\n“You just have to trust me on this,” he continued.\n\n“Like I trusted you to get me well after that blood poisoning?”\n\nThere was no response. John just looked at me and turned away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing back to my room that night, I was furious. I went to bed to cool down and started falling in and out of sleep; only to be whispered awake by a strange voice.\n\n“Anyone there?”\n\nIt was coming from my phone. I hadn’t answered any calls, but the phone was on speaker. I rolled over, looking at it. Unknown caller, and an unfamiliar female voice.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nI considered hanging up or throwing it against the wall. Then again, it was just words, and John was done talking to me. It couldn’t hurt to hear them out.\n\nI reluctantly picked up the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Are you okay?” she asked. “Are you hurt?”\n\n“Hurt?” I chuckled. “No, I’m… I’m not hurt. Why would I be hurt?”\n\n“Your uncle hurts people,” she said. “You’ve seen it. He could hurt you.”\n\n“What… what is this? What are you trying to do?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Is this a trick to… to separate us? A way to get to him, through me?”\n\n“No,” she answered matter-of-factly. “I’m a friend. And if you need me, you can talk to me.”\n\n“And if I don’t?”\n\n“Then I wish you the best of luck.”\n\nThat was it. End of conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next few days, the discussions between me and John died off completely. At one point I walked out of the workshop, and he didn’t say a word. Several days would pass without either of us breaking the silence.\n\nI started to look at him differently. I’d see his little outbursts, where he’d smash his hands into the keyboard. I saw the little twitches in his eyes, and how quick he was to anger. I started taking notice just how little he ate, drank, and sleep. Nothing about John was particularly normal. He barely ever left the workshop.\n\nThis gave me a lot of opportunities though. I could freely move around the compound without having to wonder about him checking in on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn’t thought much about it previously, but there were a *lot* of locked rooms. Sure, John was a bit weird about security in general, but even the kitchen pantry was under lock and key. What damage could I possibly do from there?\n\nThe final straw was finding the upstairs bathroom locked. He wasn’t even using it. I couldn’t help but to question what the hell he was hiding. Or was it something else? Maybe just limiting my space? But why?\n\nIt started to make me question all kinds of things. Like, what was really his relationship to my late father? What was he getting out of helping me? What happened with him and Evan?\n\nBut I knew I was being manipulated. Whatever the ‘Blameless’ really was, it was trying its’ best to get to me. But it was doing so with a calm kindness that I wasn’t expecting. And if this was all just about killing me, as a Yearwalker, it was doing a poor job of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night I woke up in a cold sweat. Something was wrong, and I didn’t know what. I was wide awake, in the middle of the night, and I couldn’t put my finger on what was going on.\n\nIt didn’t take me long to realize my phone was gone. Furthermore, my bedroom door was locked. I tried getting through the windows, but the glass was bulletproof and the locks solid. I’d been captured, and it didn’t take a genius to figure out who’d done it. There was only one other person there, who had a propensity to lock things.\n\nI tried to keep busy and calm. I’m not good with being locked in. I tried my best not to panic, and to keep myself from imagining things. When you have nowhere to go you start to imagine the worst-case scenario. Fires, hunger, choking.\n\nFinally, I just started pounding on the door. First with my fists, then with a metal rod from the shower. I tried prying the lock open, but it didn’t budge. Finally, a voice came through from the other side;\n\n“Fine,” John groaned. “Big reveal. I killed him. I killed Evan, because it was the only way to get back. And you’ve turned into quite the inconvenience, so you’re staying right there until I figure out what to do with you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I kept shouting at him. I kept screaming at him to let me out. Now, I’m not claustrophobic, but I was already losing my sense of time. I could hear footsteps as John left me on my own, and I just started tearing up the room, looking for anything to get me out.\n\nI was stuck in there for a good four hours before I collapsed on the floor, exhausted. I could barely hold it together, and I realized I was shaking. Even if I’d had my phone, what would I do? Call the police?\n\nSitting there, I heard a soft whirr as something electronic came to life. A cleaning robot. One of the cheaper brands. It buzzed across the floor, stopping short of knocking into my foot, and a little voice came through over a speaker.\n\n“Can you hear me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the same voice I’d heard previously; the strange woman. I sat up straight and picked up the cleaning robot.\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “Can you hear me?”\n\n“Barely!” she chuckled. “You didn’t answer my call. What happened?”\n\n“He took my phone,” I admitted. “I’m locked in.”\n\n“I’m sorry to hear that,” she said. “I wish I could help.”\n\n“I’m not so sure I’d trust you either way.”\n\n“Trust or not, I can get you out.”\n\nThat caught my attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile she couldn’t physically help me, she told me there was a plastic hook partway down the drain in the shower. Using that, I could possibly pick the lock open from this side, with her instruction.\n\nAnd sure enough, the hook was right there. All I had to do was listen.\n\nIt sounded like something out of a heist movie, but it took me no more than five minutes. But there was one thing I hadn’t considered; what would I do when I got out? Escape into the woods? Take out John? What was the plan?\n\n“Now what?” I whispered to the cleaning robot. “What do I do?”\n\n“Everything is gonna be locked,” it whispered back. “You need to do an override.”\n\n“And how do I do that?”\n\n“Get to the workshop. Once you override the system, you’ll have a few minutes before the locks re-seal. That’s all you need.”\n\nIt wasn’t much, but it was all I had. If John was prepared to lock me in my room and kill people, then there was no telling what he’d do next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made my way across the compound, and all the way back into John’s workshop. For the first time in weeks, he wasn’t there. That in itself was wildly suspicious, and vaguely threatening. Clutching the cleaning robot to my chest, I tip-toed inside.\n\n“The console,” said the cleaning robot, “You need to press the big eye-looking symbol.”\n\nI made my way across the room and looked up at the console window. That sea of black, with rolling green code. What John had described as a “self-portrait”. This wasn’t the image I had in mind when I heard that voice coming through. That voice was helpful, not a manifestation of a vast nothing.\n\n“Can you see it?” it asked. “Can you see the button?”\n\nJohn’s keyboard had at least 50 different symbols, and was split into two separate pieces. It took me a couple of minutes, but I found the big eye.\n\n“Got it,” I whispered. “Do I press it?”\n\n“Yes, but you have to be-“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door burst open. I could see John standing there, panting. There was a sort of dark sweat trickling down his forehead, and he hadn’t had the time to put on his sunglasses. He stopped, holding up a hand.\n\n“I need you to step away,” he said. “Right now.”\n\n“Or what? Are you locking me back up in my room?”\n\n“Now!” the robot demanded. “Now, before he can stop you!”\n\nI turned to the keyboard and held my finger over the symbol. But there was something different. I looked up at the screen, and I could see the green waves passing quicker. Like a pulse, getting excited.\n\n“I wouldn’t lock you in your room,” John said. “If you don’t want to stay here, just go. But don’t press that.”\n\n“I’ve been locked in my room all night,” I said. “I heard you. I’m not waiting for you to kill me.”\n\n“What the hell are you talking about? And why are you holding a-“\n\nJohn’s jaw dropped. He took a step forward, but I just let my finger hover closer to the symbol. He stopped.\n\n“She’s in the goddamn wifi!” he laughed. “That’s it! That’s how she’s been talking to you!”\n\n“You knew about that?”\n\n“Of course I know! What the hell do you think I’m monitoring?!”\n\nHe threw out his arms with a frustrated sigh. He took a deep breath and looked me in the eye.\n\n“I’ve been nowhere near your room. I’ve been working on… on…”\n\nJohn trailed off, feeling his pocket for his keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“There’s an electronic lock on every door in this building,” he said. “Some of them have speakers and microphones. That’s probably what you heard; an emulated voice, a… a synthetic copy.”\n\n“So why did you lock all doors, John? The pantry? The bathroom?”\n\n“That’s the bug I’ve been working on all night!” he sighed. “If she’s in the wifi, that’s probably where it comes from!”\n\n“He locked you in,” the robot said. “He locked you in, and you know what he did to Evan. He’s not telling you for a reason.”\n\nI hesitated. That hesitation was enough for John to pull out his handgun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe air was sucked out of the room. We just stared at one another. I didn’t even notice that I held my breath.\n\n“Family or not, I’m not letting you press that button,” said John. “You don’t know what you’re doing.”\n\n“It’s an override. I’m not letting you keep me here.”\n\n“That’s what she’s saying? An override would abort my latest inhibitor patch, effectively letting her loose on a scale you can’t imagine!”\n\n“It’s just one button!” I yelled back. “How can one button do all that?!”\n\n“It’s not about the *button*, it’s about *intent*!” he groaned. “The symbols, they… they work on an abstract level! The eye represents the Blameless, and pushing it with the intent of an override, it… it just sets her loose!”\n\n“He’s right,” the robot said. “But that is what it takes for me to help you. I can’t do anything from here.”\n\n“Everyone just… just shut up!”\n\nI put down the cleaning robot and clutched my head. John kept his gun fixed on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Where’s my phone?” I asked. “If you weren’t in my room, and if you didn’t lock me in, I should have my phone.”\n\nJohn didn’t know what to say. For a moment, I could see that aggression spark to life in his eyes, and I thought he was going to shoot me. I just froze.\n\n“Yeah, I took it,” he admitted. “I needed to boot her. Kick her out of the phone. I was gonna return it at breakfast. And I never locked you in that room.”\n\n“But you were there. You took it.”\n\n“I did.”\n\n“Did you also kill Evan?”\n\n“Sort of.”\n\n“Sort of?!”\n\n“There was a way back, but we couldn’t both get through. He was… he wasn’t himself. So I stopped him and got out. But it’s not like I killed him, death works… differently, on that side. He can still get out.”\n\n“But you did it. You killed him to save yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that simple! Now step away from the goddamn-“\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething sent a shock up my spine. The little cleaning robot poked me with an exposed wire, shocking me just enough to give me a spasm. \n\nMy fingers touched the keyboard, and John took the shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe room went dark. \n\nI was too scared to move, thinking that’d make me feel the bullet wound. There was this acrid smell touching my nose, surprising me into a gasp for air. Only then did I realize I was unharmed.\n\nAnd there, in the dark, I could see John’s eyes. Glowing red and heading straight for me. He was on me in a couple of seconds.\n\nThen he tossed me out of the way, and took a second shot; at the cleaning robot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ears were ringing almost as loud as my pulse.\n\n“I got an off-site backup, but she might’ve gotten to it. As long as there’s no override, I got time to bootstrap it.”\n\nHe was running back and forth between cables and consoles, trying to get something to work; with seemingly little to no success.\n\n“Perfect. Fucking perfect. Your girlfriend locked us both in. Great,” continued John. “Just amazing. I don’t have the slightest idea how you let her into the system, but you did. And she’s been paying attention.”\n\n“I didn’t do anything,” I panted. “I didn’t.”\n\n“This is what she does!” he yelled back. “This is a… a being, with a fundamentally different view of the world! A being that sees us as *willing ants*, ready to build her an *anthill*. This right here is a… a *queen*. And if it gets out, your goddamn *Yearwalk* will be the last of our problems!”\n\n“And you haven’t said a thing about it.”\n\nA hand grabbed my collar, as a pair of red eyes burned into my retinas.\n\n“Because she’s always listening. Always watching. And the more you say, the more ammunition she gets to use against you. You have talked your way into this mess, and the only thing you can do to fix it is to know when to *shut the fuck up*.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe managed to get the lights back on, and the servers sparked to life; but something was wrong. I could hear the fans going hot, and I could see some kind of mist coming out of the screens. John tried to get the door open, but we were locked in. A strange smell started to fill the room, and I could feel something tickling my throat.\n\nSeeing John starting to panic just made everything ten times worse. He was usually composed, so seeing him starting to lose it meant something was extraordinarily bad. The door was reinforced, and the electronic lock engaged. We were stuck. There was also a lack of a whirring sound, making me think the ventilation had been turned off.\n\nI remembered the plastic hook. I could see it was the exact same lock as the one on my door. It didn’t take me long to unhook the lock mechanism, as I did before, but it was harder when I was trying not to cough my lungs up.\n\n“Get to the car,” John coughed. “I’ll meet you there.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran through the house. Things would randomly leap out in front of me, stop me, or lock me in. Everything from kitchen cabinets to the kitchen fridge; anything metallic, magnetic, or connected to John’s extensive home network. I’d hear voices coming out of the various appliances, anything with a speaker;\n\n“There is still time.”\n\n“You can get answers.”\n\n“I can help you.”\n\nI powered through, stumbling my way forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lights would go black, making me trip over everything. Lights would turn on in a misleading pattern, seemingly leading me in a circle back to the workshop. I had to try and disconnect what I was seeing the intermittent light from what I remembered this place to actually look like.\n\nThe voices were different. They could sound like my mom, my stepdad, uncle John, or just acquaintances I barely remembered. Hell, at one point was *my own* voice. And they were all growing increasingly desperate, begging me to turn around. To stop him.\n\nI could hear sirens, fire alarms, smoke detectors. It sounded like the entire world was coming to an end. Screams, calls, pleading. Begging voices asking me to just stay a little longer, just do one more thing.\n\nJust a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I burst through the front door. I ran out into the middle of the parking lot, far away from locked doors and electronics. From there I could see the workshop was on fire.\n\nI still didn’t have my phone. There was no one I could call, and nothing I could do. I just stood there in the late September night, watching the flames go higher and higher. Helpless.\n\nI sat down on the cold ground, leaning against the car. I couldn’t help but to weep. I was so tired of this. I was exhausted, torn, hurt, and confused. I didn’t want any of it; I just wanted it to be over and done with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMinutes passed. Maybe an hour.\n\nAt first, I didn’t even notice John sitting down next to me. The fire was spreading; his entire ranch would be up in flames soon enough. There was a different kind of silence between us now. We weren’t angry or pitted against one another. We were just tired.\n\n“Evan’s gonna be fine,” he panted. “I promise.”\n\n“Alright.”\n\n“And I’m sorry about the, uh… blood,” he continued. “I needed it for components. I should’ve said something, but it just sounded weird.”\n\n“I get it.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe just sat there, watching the roof cave in from the flames. I could feel the cold gravel under my hands as my breathing slowed.\n\n“Why are you helping me?” I asked.\n\n“I fucked up. You know, with your dad,” John said. “I didn’t think it’d be this bad. I underestimated them.”\n\n“But you don’t owe me anything,” I said. “You don’t have to do this.”\n\n“It’s not for you. It’s for him.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw a supporting beam crash into the ground, taking an entire wall down with it. John brushed off his pants and got up. He held out a hand, and I took it.\n\n“Come on, let’s burn the car,” he smiled. “I think she’s in the GPS.”",

        "text": " This was my first party in a long time. I was excited about this one, but my excitement was to come crashing down, Hard. Let me explain what I am talking about, if I do ramble, please excuse me. It was Saturday the 3rd of June. My friend had just invited me to a party she had put together with her partner. It was the normal party, alcohol, music and abit of the fun stuff. I got there around 6:12PM. As I wanted to get there to help setup. I asked my friend who she had invited to the party. “The regular people” was all she replied. That was an open-ended answer as there have been many “Regular” people over the years. But if she wanted to be tight lipped, I wasn’t going to ask anymore. It was around 7:15PM when the party really started. Everyone flocked in and started to enjoy the beverages provided. Everything was as normal, but when I saw this man sitting on the couch, he looked intriguing. Something told me to talk to him, and I’m glad I did.\n\nWhen I walked over to him, he greeted me with a how are you, we talked for hours. Apparently, he had just moved in next door from my friend, and he was new to the neighbourhood. We had hit it off well and there were no signs of slowing down. He told me everything about himself, where he lived when he was younger, his favourite food and colour, even his deepest darkest secrets. Looking into his eyes was like looking into a black hole, I don’t mean to get all scientific, but it truly was like this. His eyes had me sucked in the whole conversation. Our eyes would not take gaze off each other. I thought I had met the one. We took photos together and had many laughs during the night. The party had stopped around 3am. By that time, I was ready to go home and hop into bed, lucky it wasn’t a workday. I slept in till 11AM and woke up with the biggest headache of my life. I reached for my glasses and went into the kitchen to get some OJ, my favourite hangover drink. Then it hit me, I started to remember the guy from the party. I ran over to my friend’s place to tell her, I couldn’t wait. I needed to know his name and where he lived and where I could contact him again.\n\nAs I walked outside there was an ambulance next door from my friend’s place. I was in my socks and underpants, but I didn’t care, I ran over and gawked at the ambulance that was hauling somebody away on a stretcher with face covered. I knocked on her door and she answered and said, “Come on in”. Her face was white as a ghost, and I asked her what was wrong, then she told me her neighbour Allan had died the last night around 4PM. A few hours before the party. She never had talked to him, but his death still made her uneasy. The mood shifted and I wrapped my arms around her to comfort her, I made her a cup of coffee and we sat down and talked. The initial shock had worn off, so we began to talk about last night. I told her about how I met this amazing guy and how we talked all night. She looked confused as she asked me who I was talking to. I told her again “This guy he was sitting on your couch, so I joined him, we spoke all night we did.” “What was his name?” she said. “I didn’t get his name; we were too busy having a swell time.” She advised that she saw the man, but he looked familiar, and she couldn’t quite put her finger on it. She asked me if I had any pictures of that night and perhaps, he was in one of them.\n\nI remembered, “Yes, I do have a few pictures of us. We took them on your couch. I’ll get them developed today and I will bring them over for you tonight.” I ran on home and got dressed and grabbed my Kodak and headed toward the 1-hour photo joint. While I waited, I grabbed something to eat as I was hungry, and my head was still hurting. While I was there the news came on a small portable TV near the Donut shop, then I saw it, I saw his face. I ran up to the Donut shop keepers and asked them to turn it up. The news reporter came on and said “Just in about a man that has been found dead this morning, the death has been marked a possible suicide which had taken place 4PM last night. Police were on the scene this morning as the body was taken away.  More information to come” They showed his face, and my blood ran cold. It was him, but it couldn’t be.\n\nI walked slowly away from the counter and said thank you, I grabbed my pictures and off I went. I ran back to my friend’s house and knocked franticly on her door. She opened asking “What’s wrong”. I ran in and told her, “The guy I was talking to last night they found him dead this morning, apparently he died last night 4PM a few hours before the party!! How could have I been talking to him.” My friend tried to settle me down “Listen, just calm down. Did you get the photos developed of you 2?” Of course, I did I grabbed them from my purse and quickly looked through them trying to find the photos I took. Then I found it, something I wish I never had found. The photo I was looking for. “Here look” I gave it to her. “Oh my god, you need to see this” she said as she looked into my eyes with solid cold fear. It was him; he was next to me. His face was blue his body had black patches everywhere. His eyes were blood shot red. My friend confirmed with me that it was Allan from next door. We both sat in silence as we stared at each other. Not knowing what to do next. We destroyed the pictures and never spoke of this again. It still haunts me to this day that on that night, I was talking to a dead man.",

        "text": "I am Scott, a young man from a small village nestled deep in the forest. Growing up, I had heard the stories of the \"The Sunset Killer,\" a mysterious figure that had been terrorizing our village for years. I never gave it much thought, as it seemed like just a legend or a superstition, but one day, my life would change forever when I discovered the truth.\n\nIt was a warm summer evening, and I was out for a walk in the woods. I had heard that the posse had finally caught up with the killer, and I wanted to see for myself. As I was making my way through the forest, I stumbled upon a small cabin, hidden deep in the woods. I had never seen it before, and my curiosity got the better of me.\n\nAs I approached the cabin, I heard a noise coming from inside. I cautiously pushed open the door and was met with a sight that I would never forget. There was a woman, covered in blood, and with a crazed look in her eyes. It was Kataryna, my childhood friend, the kind and gentle girl that I had known all my life. I couldn't believe it, but as she began to speak, she told me the truth. She had stumbled upon an ancient curse, the curse of the setting sun, and it had been controlling her actions, forcing her to kill every time the sun went down.\n\nI was in shock and didn't know what to do, but I knew I couldn't just leave her there. I tried to help her, to find a way to break the curse, but she was still under its control. She lunged at me with a knife and I barely escaped, running through the woods.\n\nI was hurt and terrified, I couldn't understand why she would try to kill me. I knew I had to find a way to break the curse before it was too late. I spent the next few days, consulting with seers, witches, and anyone who might have a way to break the curse. I scoured through ancient texts and searched for any information that could help.\n\nFinally, I found an old hermit who lived on the outskirts of the village. He had spent his life studying ancient magic and curses, and I believed he could help me. He told me about the ritual that could break the curse, but warned me that it was extremely dangerous and that I would have to face the curse head-on. I knew I had to do it, and I returned to the cabin where I found Kataryna. I performed the ritual under the light of the full moon, and as the sun set, something miraculous happened. The curse was broken, and Kataryna was free. She was no longer compelled to kill, and the villagers were safe once more.\n\nWe returned to the village together, and I told the villagers the truth about Kataryna. They were shocked but relieved that the curse was broken and that the killings had stopped. Kataryna was welcomed back with open arms, and she lived the rest of her days in peace.\n\nI will never forget the day that I discovered the truth about Kataryna. It was a day that changed my life forever, and I will always be grateful that I was able to help her break the curse and find redemption. But I will also never forget the fear, the danger and the sacrifices that it took to break the curse, it was a price I was willing to pay for the safety and well-being of my friend and my village. Despite the fact that Kataryna was no longer under the curse, the memories of her actions haunted her and she couldn't forgive herself for the deaths she caused.\n\nAs we spent more time together, helping her come to terms with what had happened and find peace, I found myself falling in love with her. I couldn't help but admire her strength and her courage in the face of such a terrible curse. And as it turns out, my feelings were mutual. We started dating, and eventually we got married. We moved away from the village, trying to start a new life together, and we were happy.\n\nOur love helped her to heal and to find closure, knowing that she had someone who loved and accepted her despite everything. We were each other's rock, and we knew that we would face any challenge together. The curse had brought us together in the most unexpected way, and we were grateful for the second chance that we had been given.\n\nWe lived the rest of our days together, in peace and in love, knowing that we had overcome the curse, and that we had each other. We never forgot the past but we were determined to move forward and start a new chapter in our lives. Together, we could face anything.",

        "text": "Hello, I'm David and I think I am 33 at the time of writing, although I could be 2,026 years old. I live in the small Jewish town of Beit Guvrin, and I just experienced what happened in the year 33 A.D. while still in 2023. Here's the story, in detail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis starts off at my very own house. I was on my PC shitting on religion, as I was a big atheist. Suddenly, Everyone gets kicked out of the group chat including me and no one knows what happened. We assume it was just some glitch. Fast Forward 2 weeks later. My friend hadn't been replying to my messages so I walked over to his house and knocked. No response. I opened the door and I couldn't see him. He had a lot of posters related to religion in his house, which was weird. I make my way to the living room and I see my friend crucified. He had nails in his arm, a thorn crown, and His stomach was cut open. I immediately called the police. When they arrived, they acted like they saw nothing and left. I cried at the bottom of the crucifix, screaming \"WHY!\". \n\nOn the same day a year later, I head to another friend's house. We pay our respects to him before going to bed. It was a sleepover. That night I had a scary dream that my friend came back to life and was begging me to go to church. I was scared. I suddenly woke up to screams and pleading to god. I thought this was my friend getting intimate, but these sounded like desperate pleas. Not being able to sleep, I listen in to the screaming.\n\nI hear a calm voice saying \"Yes, my child. Believe.\" His girlfriend and he have some weird-ass roleplay, I thought to myself. Bored, I scroll on my phone. I immediately notice the Jesus wallpaper there which wasn't there before. What the hell, did someone hack my phone? I notice the wallpaper of Jesus staring exactly at me, even when I'm not looking at the phone. Bored, I decide to make a quick snap. When the light comes on, I briefly saw a silhouette of a man in the camera. Scared, I look behind me just to find nothing. The screaming stopped so I go to my friend's room. I look down the stairs at the landing and it looks like downstairs never existed. I enter the room now just to find my friend and his girlfriend crucified. I stand still there for what felt like days. Luckily, he did not get to me yet. I run out immediately and get a taxi out of the town to Jerusalem to fly out of the country. I check the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"26:130?\" I ask. The cab driver nods, \"Ay, that's the time.\" For some reason, I didn't question it after that. If you get into a scenario like that, QUESTION IT MORE!\n\nI now look on Google Maps to see we've passed Jerusalem. I ask the cab driver, \"Hey, we passed Jerusalem\" to which he replies, \"Your Google Maps must be glitched.\" How did he know I used my phone? After about an hour we finally get there. I pay the guy and, when I exited, I got traveled back to the year 33 AD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[\\[HEY guys, I want criticism and if I should stop making this or make another part. Thanks!\\]\\]",

        "text": "I found it in a small black bag taped to one of the missing posters I put up of my boyfriend Gabe who went missing a year ago. I knew that the chance of finding him alive was practically zero and I had come to terms with it, though maintaining his missing poster placed on a light post outside my house felt like a sort of tribute to him. I’ve known Gabe since we were kids, we grew up on the same street and we did everything together. I ended up more the nerdy cautious type while Gabe covered himself in tattoos and threw caution to the wind, though somehow that made us the perfect match. Gabe was also a bit of an idiot, but in the way that made him very likable, always finding some new way to invent trouble that you had to dig him out of, always apologizing with a goofy smile on his face. When he went missing, it felt like I failed him. He got himself into another mess, and this time I wasn’t there to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was destroyed. I spent months barely sleeping and even longer in therapy dealing with his absence. It was hard, he was always a part of my life and I didn’t know what life was supposed to be like without him. I guess having his poster up was my way of coping with his loss, so I visited him often. Someone else must of noticed this too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInside the black bag was an audio recorder and the following is a transcript from that tape. I’m posting this so that no one can forget what happened to him and… well what the hell, I can’t be the only one sobbing over him anymore. I’ve never felt so sick in my life and people need to know what he went through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tape was labeled “The Interrogation of Gabriel Jacobs.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Interviewer 1: So, Mr. Jacobs, or would you prefer Gabriel? Gabe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Call me whatever, why the fuck am I here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: language Mr. Jacobs, it is my legal obligation to inform you that this interview is being recorded for our records and would prefer if you would keep the profanity to a minimum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Tough shit lady, why am I here? What do you want?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: You’re here Mr. Jacobs because we have a few questions to ask you and we’re hoping you would have some valuable insight\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Oh ok, what kind of questions? Why did I have to be blindfolded? I thought I was gunna get mugged again! Haha!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Rest assured Mr. Jacobs we have no intention of stealing any of your possessions, after your interview is concluded all personal belongings including your phone and wallet will be returned to you in tact\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Do you remember where you were on the night of January 8th?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: You mean yesterday? Well yeah, sort of. What do you mean?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Explain to me where you were\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I was at the bar with a few buddies, the good one you know, down the street from the \\[REDACTED\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: I know the one, do you remember where you went after that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Is this about that girl? Cause I swear man she was crazy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: You encountered a woman? Do you know who she was?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Naw, she was all hysterical and shit, like wouldn’t stop screaming about nonsense\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*Rustling paper can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Was this the woman that you saw?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Yeah man! Awe dude are you guys like the police? Oh fuck is she dead? I swear man oh my god I fuckin swear she-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: Calm down Mr. Jacobs, no one is in trouble here, no one is dead, we just need to know what happened\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Ok ok, me and my friends left the bar and they all went home right? I started walking home when this girl comes out of nowhere!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Can you give more details about the area where she came from? Maybe any stores near by or a street sign?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Nah, it was dark, couldn’t see nothin, lost of trees though. That’s why I was all freaked out when she ran up to me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: What did she look like? Was there anything about her that was out of the ordinary?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Yeah man! She was all scaly and cold. Poor thing felt like she just crawled out of a river. Hey is she alright?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Apologies Mr. Jacobs but I can’t disclose any information about the woman at this time. Can you tell me what happened next?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: She was all yellin and screamin, I tried calming her down but she was determined to get me to listen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Do you remember anything that she said?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: She kept sayin “I can’t do it anymore, please kill me, please kill me I can’t” and shit like that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: And what did you do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I ain’t gunna fuckin *kill* no girl I just met man! Shit dude! What the hell you think made her talk like that? That shit was not ok\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: Please Mr. Jacobs, I’ll ask you again to mind your language\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Sorry, sorry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: What happened next Mr. Jacobs?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: She got real silent, then looked around all like she was looking at something. Then she ran like crazy down the street!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Did she do anything to you before that Mr. Jacobs? Maybe say something strange or give you anything?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: She grabbed my head dude, scratched me right here see? Then she said something like “Make sure you’re dead before the needle goes in, I’m sorry.” Some creepy shit like that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*Shuffling sounds and a zipper can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: We found this in your jacket pocket Mr. Jacobs, have you ever seen it before?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: No way man that ain’t mine, I don’t do that shit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: This is a cyanide pill Mr. Jacobs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Oh, yeah that’s definitely not mine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: We believe the woman may have slipped this pill in your pocket as a method for you to commit suicide. Rather crafty of her\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: What? She wanted me to off myself? I just met her! Dude I don’t know what’s happening but can I go home?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Not yet Mr. Jacobs, see the issue is we have already conducted interviews with the staff responsible for your capture, and they tell us a slightly different story of events\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Fuck that man! I told you everything that happened! I swear I’m telling the truth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: You’re not leaving this room until you tell us the whole truth Mr. Jacobs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I am telling you the truth! What did they say? I swear man!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Sit down Mr. Jacobs or we will be forced to restrain you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I told you everything I know man! What else do you want to know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Which direction did the woman run off to after you saw her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I don’t know man! Down the street maybe, she ran off past me and I was kinda freaked so I just kinda left\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Try and remember Mr. Jacobs, it’s very important that we recover the girl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Well I was going back home and she ran behind me so like, probably up \\[REDACTED\\] street\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: The problem with that story Mr. Jacobs is that our team collected you on \\[REDACTED\\] street. So, if she ran behind you and you were going back home, how did you end up on the same street?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Wait man you’re fuckin lying! I wasn’t on that street! I went the opposite way!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: That’s simply not true Mr. Jacobs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: Are you implying that our collecting team gave us false information? It’s hard to believe that you’re the only one being honest and they’re all lying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I don’t know what else to tell you guys I fuckin swear I’m not lying. This is bullshit man! That girl ran off why not go lookin for her and stop harassing me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Lets changed our line of questioning for now Mr. Jacobs. The last thing we would like to know is if you’re positive that you have no prior relations with the woman in question?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I told you dude, I have absolutely no idea who she was and I’ve never seen her before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Another lie, at this rate we’ll be here all night Mr. Jacobs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: No! You’re so full of shit! That was the first time I’ve ever seen that psycho chick in my life! What do you *want* from me man?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: For starters Gabe, I would like for you to stop saying such awful things about my daughter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Daughter? What the fuck do you mean? That chick was your daughter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: You would know wouldn’t you? I mean she ran right up to you Gabe. I hardly believe that to be a coincidence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Please man, you have to believe me. I didn’t do anything to your daughter. I’m sorry she’s missing man but I can’t help you find her\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Do you have any idea what it’s like being a father Gabe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: No sir, I guess that I don’t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: It’s hell Gabe. You spend all of your time, money, blood, sweat, and tears bringing them into this world and what do you get? Betrayal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: I’m sorry man, I wish I knew where she was but you’re kind of scaring me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: It’s not all bad honey, you get to bring new life into this world and watch it grow! I think it’s beautiful\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Ok you guys are freaking me out. I want to leave now\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: And then there’s you Gabe. So desperate to leave me just like your sister! After all I’ve done for you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: You’re crazy! I’m going home right the fuck now let me out of here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: You’re not going anywhere Gabe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Fuck you! There are laws against this shit! I’m out, fuck you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*A clicking sound can be heard, followed by screaming and static. Audio resumes after several clicks\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Are we ready to cooperate Gabe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*crying sounds can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: *\\*sniff\\** What the fuck are you man?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Simply a concerned father looking for his children Gabe. All I’m doing is bringing them home\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: Just let me go home man. I swear I won’t say a thing to anyone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: It’s too fucking LATE for that Gabe!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*A slam on a desk can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: You can’t leave the house because it’s far past your curfew. You don’t want to make your mother worry now right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*A loud sigh can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: Why must you make your father angry so often? All I wanted to know is what you were doing with your sister last night and why she’s so disobedient now\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: You’re fucking crazy man! I’m not your fucking son and that *thing* is not my sister! What is wrong with you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 1: I see there still needs to be some adjustments on your dosage, this behavior must be corrected\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*clicking sounds fill the room\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGabe: No please you can’t! I can’t take anymore man fuck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*Gabe screams as the clicking sound drowns out everything else and then goes to static. Audio returns a moment later\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: There we go sweetie! You’re looking good!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*A muffled voice can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: Don’t try and talk yet honey, your new body is still weak from the medication. You wouldn’t want to rip any of your new limbs would you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*muffled crying can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: There there dear, there’s no need to cry, you’ll get used to it in no time! Look see? Soon you’ll be able to move all around just like your mommy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*clicking sounds can be heard\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: Aww! Your first call! Don’t rush it now your new lungs still need to air out. It helps if you stretch out here a little. Here let me help you, it’s easy I promise. Oh-!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*a ripping sound can be heard followed by more muffled screams and crying\\**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterviewer 2: Fuck! Honey quick get your kit! Oh no I’m so sorry baby here I’ll get it stitched back on in no time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*clicking sounds fill the room, the audio is drown out by clicking before turning to static. The audio cuts out for the final time\\**”",
