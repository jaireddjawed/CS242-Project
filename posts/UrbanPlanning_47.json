I'm looking for instances where affordable housing has been required by local governments as part of a market rate development but separately financed, owned, and operated. Does anyone have any knowledge or expertise in this area?\n\nIs it possible to condominimize and sell affordable units if they are scattered throughout the development and not all on one floor? There could be up to three separate buildings or components in this particular development. The affordable housing would be allocated across all three components, but the goal is to have it financed and operated by an independent entity. ",

        "text": "Hi r/UrbanPlanning - Just found this sub and the timing couldn't be more ideal, because I have some questions for y'all.\n\nI'm considering going back to school for an Urban Planning degree, specifically the Theories of Urban Practice MA at Parsons School of Design. I've always been interested in Urban Planning and Design, especially in light of sustainable development and ecology, but was previously trying to forge a career in academia. Things haven't panned out the way I would have liked (personally and in the field), and now I have this great opportunity to find a new career path, and I believe Urban Planning or some type of urban policy work would be a fulfilling career that would work to improve the lives of human beings (and hopefully the environment?).\n\nMy background consists of a BA in Religion and Cultural Development and an MA in Historical Theology. The BA involved of quite a bit of Urban Studies, Sociology, and Architecture (though mostly from a historical point of view). MA, less so, but architecture and ancient urban design played a significant role in my studies.\n\nI'm curious as to what kind of career I can foster with this degree, what kind of jobs I would be able to find, and if I'd be able to build a successful career, given my age (I'm 28 atm, would begin the program at age 30). If it's relevant, I live in NYC and plan on staying in the Mid-Atlantic/New England.\n\nI'm also looking for any reading recommendations in the subject. I've read a lot of the usual stuff, but I'm open to whatever might help me sharpen my focus.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

No high school kid wants to talk about the intricacies of drafting zoning by-law provisions haha. Otherwise, I'm going to look for a few key projects or districts that show planning/design principles at play with a bunch of images to show them.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has ever done a presentation like this before, to a high school audience?

Has the cost increased dramatically relative to the cost of inflation?",

The city had posted plans, but have since removed them off of the City's site. The options for this bike lane, as described by local news as “This four-lane divided artery would add a buffered bike lane. A few options are being considered, including one with the bike lane to the far right of the road, maintaining two car lanes, and one that can double as travel or parking. Another option has a permanent parking lane to the far right, the bike lane in the middle and a single car travel lane.\" \n\nI would personally love to be able to use the bike lanes, have a bit of a reduction in traffic noise and have something to help mitigate the speeding and crashes that result from that.
