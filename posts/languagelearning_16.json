I am an English teacher from Singapore and my school occasionally runs these little workshops where we get to share our something we are interested in with our colleagues. It is my turn next week and I picked Spanish. I am hoping to introduce not only some fundamentals but also to maybe garner interest in Spanish and encourage some people to actually pick it up themselves :)\n\nI thought a fun little thing would be to kind of prepare a video \"interviewing\" native speakers about their native slang, especially since Spanish is so diverse. I know there are videos on the internet about this but I kind of want my colleagues to see me, someone they know, actually speak some Spanish as part of lowkey convincing them to pick it up on their own haha. \n\nI'm not a fluent speaker but I generally can hold a conversation if my partner has some patience. The interview will (hopefully) be in Spanish and I am happy to provide some EL help in return if wanted! I would be very grateful if anyone could help out. I don't anticipate it will take long and the video will NOT be shared in any public space, as it will only be for educational use. I'm hoping to get someone from Spain and someone from Latinoamerica, although I'm sadly not going to be able to represent all the countries / regions!\n\nPlease comment, not DM if you'd be interested in this! üôè really appreciate anyone's help",

        "text": "Any advice on what to add/remove from my learning is appreciated. Started studying Spanish two weeks ago.\n\n1) Downloaded HelloTalk on Day 1 to force myself to talk and listen to native speakers. I started off having to google translate everything I wanted to say, but now I do my best to think of the Spanish sentence first, then check my sentences on google translate. I‚Äôm pretty close except for verb tenses (I only know present tense as of now and am still working on irregular present tense, will learn past tense soon). I have about 9 native speakers as language partners and we will send 30-60 second voice recordings to each other. So I listen to a few sentences of Spanish and will send back 1-3 sentences of Spanish to them. We also type in Spanish back and forth, but I make sure to send voice messages to my partners each day. The hardest part is thinking of new and interesting topics of conversation, so it‚Äôs not always ‚ÄúHow was your day/what are your plans‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried four live phone calls but not sure how useful it is until I learn more tenses. I definitely prefer sending recorded messages back and forth as of now.\n\n2) 1-2 units of Duolingo a day. It feels slow to me, so what I do is jump ahead one unit and take the test to unlock the previous unit. Then I go back to the unit I skipped over and do each ‚Äúbutton‚Äù on legendary mode. Is this ok to do, or am I missing out on something valuable? When I take the test to skip ahead, I may just get one question wrong because I didn‚Äôt know a vocab word. But then the word is revealed to me and I get practice using it when I go back and do the exercises on legendary.\n\n3) Listen to the Coffee Break Spanish podcast when in my car, walking my dog, and cooking. I usually have time for 2-3 of their 20min episodes a day. I also don‚Äôt move onto a new episode before listening to each episode 2-3 times and feel like I have a decent-ish grasp of the vocab. I may not remember every new word, only most of them. Should I move faster with the podcast or repeat each episode more times?\n\n4) Just discovered Dreaming Spanish on Youtube yesterday. Thinking of ending my night with one or two videos as I fall asleep?\n\n5) Also started taking music recommendations from my language partners yesterday. Began translating some lyrics and will hopefully learn the chorus (or more) to some songs to help me with speaking faster and reminding me of the new words I‚Äôm learning.\n\n6) I made a list of verbs to learn based on category (-ar, -er, -ir, e to ie, o to ue, e to i) along with practice sentences. This is where I‚Äôm currently at with present tense verbs and am eager to move on to another tense so I can start talking about tomorrow and yesterday without google translate.\n\n\nHelloTalk, Duolingo, and Coffee Break Spanish are my priorities, and the rest are to keep things fun and interesting. Any suggestions on how to boost my learning? I‚Äôm currently injured and can‚Äôt play guitar or exercise, so I made it a goal to learn Spanish. Thanks for your input.",

        "text": "I'm currently on my third book in Portuguese. The previous two books that I read were easier and much more focused on the overall story and dialogue, while this book that I'm reading now is much more descriptive, and harder to read. This author has a tendency to dive into lengthy descriptions of particular scenes or environments. During these descriptions, I'm running into unknown words frequently. Descriptive words like \"sinuoso\" (winding), \"brotar\" (to spout), \"impelir\" (to propel), \"bramir\" (to roar), you get the idea.\n\nWhen I encounter these words, I'm conflicted. Because *of course* these are words that I'm familiar with in English. So I should learn them in Portuguese as well, right? Plus, knowing them will speed up my reading and make it less tedious. On the other hand, my listening comprehension is pitiful right now, and I should probably spend more time working on that.\n\nMy goal is primarily centered on understanding **spoken** Portuguese, but reading has so far been very helpful in teaching me the vocabulary required to be able to understand, regardless if it's text or spoken. I'm wondering if at this point that benefit has worn off, and I'm learning words now that are very unlikely to come up in spoken language. As you might be able to tell, I'm already somewhat decided on taking a break from reading and focusing on improving my listening comprehension, but I also wanted to hear some insights from those of you who might have already encountered this dilemma.",

Copage, Feb. 11, 2023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your French coming along?‚Äù The familiar voice, accompanied by a light tap on my shoulder, surprised me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned and saw a former girlfriend, who was born in the Ivory Coast and raised in Paris.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúComme ci comme √ßa,‚Äù I responded as I accustomed myself to her unexpected presence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn reality, I‚Äôd barely spoken a word of French since our amicable breakup a decade earlier. After our fleeting chance encounter at the Museum of Modern Art, I wondered: If our relationship had endured would I have continued taking the French classes I had started? Or would she have succumbed to the gravitational pull of Lingua Britannica.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat meeting made me wonder about multilingual couples and whether they speak their partner‚Äôs native language. What about couples who had more than two languages between them? If the couple was fluent in each other‚Äôs native language, what was their language of love? Did one language prevail over the other in everyday use, and if so, why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of households speaking a language other than English increased to 28.7 million in 2021 from 25 million in 2015. During that period, the percentage of households speaking a language other than English rose to 22.5 percent from 21.2 percent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMichael Kaye, the head of global communications at OkCupid, said people who speak two to three languages got 11 percent more matches and 22 percent more likes on the dating app over the last 90 days than those who only speak one language. This was based on an in-app question that has been posed on the OkCupid app since 2009.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Kaye said that when it comes to preferences on the app, 92 percent of people worldwide are fine being matched with people who don‚Äôt speak English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIngrid Piller, a professor of applied linguistics at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, said this receptivity is likely related to greater mobility through temporary and permanent immigration as a result of educational and employment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúMultilingual couples may face unique challenges,‚Äù wrote Nai Chieh Tien, in her 2013 dissertation about multilingual couples and language differences. ‚ÄúIndividuals who are bilingual or multilingual learn the second or third language at different times in their lives, and develop a variety of attachments and relationships when using different languages.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJean-Marc Dewaele, a professor in applied linguistics and multilingualism at Birkbeck, University of London, said during an interview on the podcast Raising Multilinguals LIVE, ‚ÄúYou may prefer to use a specific language in a specific domain. For example, English is very much my academic language, maybe also my social language, these days. But it‚Äôs not the language I would read poetry. And because French is my language of poetry, it‚Äôs closer to my heart.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Times asked several couples to share how they navigate the heart-shaped expectations of their multilingual relationships. Here are the accounts of five couples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFiore di Fabrizio and Jennifer Miller-Wolf\n\nPenne, Italy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúMy Italian was at the complete beginner‚Äôs level, but still exceeded his nonexistent English,‚Äù said Jennifer Miller-Wolf, 61. She met her husband, Fiore di Fabrizio, 66, in early 2020 just before the pandemic lockdown. They were members of the Penne-Abruzzo chapter of Club Alpino Italiano, a hiking and mountaineering organization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMs. Miller-Wolf, who had recently relocated to Italy, said she and Mr. di Fabrizio, an independent solar energy contractor, ‚Äúbumbled along in my broken, Italian, and some version of hand sign language, at which the Italians are quite talented.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI do not find Italian as romantic a language as most of my friends,‚Äù said Ms. Miller-Wolf, a retired teacher of French and German from Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ‚ÄúQuite frequently, it sounds to me as if they are having a disagreement, even if they are not.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, she deferred to her husband‚Äôs language because, for one thing, she was living in Italy. She also picks up languages more quickly than he does, she said, ‚Äúalthough a few English endearments ‚Äî ‚Äòsweetie,‚Äô ‚Äòhoney,‚Äô and ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô ‚Äî are finally making their way in every now and then.‚Äù On such occasions, she said, she praises him with, ‚ÄúHoney, you‚Äôre learning,‚Äù first in English, then in Italian to make sure he understood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about hearing ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô in your own native tongue, it somehow touches you deeper,‚Äù she said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMs. Miller-Wolf found that her husband responds differently when she speaks to him in Italian.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúIf I say something like, ‚ÄòOh, give me a hug,‚Äô it takes him a minute to get it in English,‚Äù Ms. Miller-Wolf said. ‚ÄúHe kind of doesn‚Äôt react because he needs to register it first. If I say to him, ‚Äòteso‚Äô, which is short for ‚Äòtesoro,‚Äô treasure, he‚Äôll immediately turn to me. His face will light up and he‚Äôll come right over and give me a kiss.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMichael Lemay and Jorge D. Aguilar\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúMy mother is from Central America,‚Äù said Jorge D. Aguilar, 38, an attorney for the Treasury Department in Washington. ‚ÄúI grew up in Miami and moved around the East Coast speaking Spanish and English at home. I learned French in high school.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMichael Lemay, 46, a statistician with the U.S. Census Bureau in Washington, grew up in rural Quebec where he spoke only French at home, he said. He became fluent in English while attending undergraduate and graduate school in the United States.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe couple met in March 2018 at a bar in Washington.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe had one of those great talks during which you sense you have known this person for so long,‚Äù Mr. Aguilar said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir first conversations were in English, but as their relationship evolved, French became increasingly important in communicating affection and romance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI think one major reason we started moving to French was when, several months into our relationship, we acknowledged we loved each other,‚Äù Mr. Aguilar said. ‚ÄúFrench was the language we chose to use in expressing that mutual, meaningful sentiment.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Aguilar added, ‚ÄúEnglish is the language of everyday life ‚Äî what I use when giving strangers directions or booking dinner reservations. But love is profound and transcends the commonplace.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRobert Rohrschneider and Rebecca Rovit\n\nLawrence, Kan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRebecca Rovit and Robert Rohrschneider, both 63, met on a train in Germany in 1982. They were returning to the University of Freiburg, where they were both students, although they didn‚Äôt know each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey chatted amicably in German on the train, then went their separate ways. Two or so weeks later at the university, they chanced into each other on campus, and she said in German, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre the guy from the train! How are you?‚Äù (‚ÄúWie geht es Dir?‚Äù)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThat was the beginning of our relationship and life together,‚Äù she said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe spoke German exclusively, with occasional English words,‚Äù said Dr. Rovit, an associate professor of theater at the University of Kansas, in Lawrence, where her husband is a distinguished professor of political science.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until the fall of 1983 ‚Äî over a year after they first met ‚Äî that the couple began speaking English to each other when Dr. Rohrschneider came to the United States for a graduate fellowship at Michigan State University.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThe gradual switch came about because we were both living in a predominately English-speaking environment,‚Äù Dr. Rovit said. ‚ÄúAnd he was using English every day. In Europe, we tend to speak more German with one another.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe use both English and German to express our love and affection,‚Äù Dr. Rovit said. ‚ÄúWe mix the languages. It feels more natural and true to use our native tongues. The words of our birth languages are heartfelt, and their sounds, familiar and comforting.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe couple married in May 1990 in Lexington, Ky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWhen we got married,‚Äù Dr. Rovit said, ‚Äúwe each said our wedding vows aloud in our native language: I in English and he, in German. I felt that such important words before friends and family had to be expressed in the language we knew best. That way we could be sure we meant what we said!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveline de Smalen and Douglas Bell\n\nGroningen, the Netherlands\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveline de Smalen, 30, is a curator at Wadden Sea World Heritage Center in Lauwersoog, the Netherlands; Douglas Bell, 38, is a history teacher at Rotterdam International Secondary School.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe couple met in October 2015 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where Dr. Bell, who is American, and Dr. de Smalen, who is Dutch, were doctoral students.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe started spending more and more time together,‚Äù said Dr. Bell, noting their mutual love of museums, hiking, traveling, cooking and baking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring a trip to Italy together in the spring of 2016, their relationship blossomed and became romantic, but as of that August, it also became long-distance. Dr. Bell‚Äôs fellowship ended and he had to return to the United States. They remained in contact with daily texts and video chats. They also visited each other every few months until he relocated to the Netherlands roughly five years later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúUntil I moved to the Netherlands in April 2021, we spoke almost exclusively in English to each other,‚Äù Dr. Bell said. ‚ÄúStarting in 2017, we started using Dutch phrases of affection. Since arriving in the Netherlands, I have developed a high proficiency in the Dutch language. Today, we speak Dutch to each other for basic conversation, but we speak English for more complex topics.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe most often express our love and affection in Dutch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe frequently use: ‚ÄòIk houd van jou‚Äô‚Äù (which means I love you in Dutch). ‚ÄúWe most often address each other with the word ‚Äòliefje‚Äô or ‚Äòlief,‚Äô which means ‚Äòmy love‚Äô or ‚Äòdear‚Äô in Dutch. We also use a version we made up: ‚Äòlieffie lief‚Äô that is not used in Dutch, that we know of.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDr. Bell said that speaking Dutch to his wife is how he shows affection, while also acknowledging that her language is important to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe expressed and express our affection in Dutch because it was a way for me to engage in my wife‚Äôs language and demonstrate my love and affection for her in her own language.‚Äù Dr. Bell said. ‚ÄúShe very much liked and likes that we express our love in Dutch since English is our default language.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmanda Lopez and Rob Ciesielski\n\nManila and Washington, D.C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLanguages were central in the lives of Amanda Lopez, 37, and Rob Ciesielski, 42, before they met. In August 2021, both were subscribed to Duolingo, a language-learning app and website. Ms. Lopez, who lives in Manila, was learning Mandarin; Mr. Ciesielski, who lives in Washington, was learning Spanish. Her Duolingo profile information included a photo. He later said he reached out to her in part because of her ‚Äúcuteness.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe couldn‚Äôt message her using Duolingo, so he said he reached out to her by clicking her ‚Äúcongratulate‚Äù button for each consecutive language lesson she completed. She did the same with him. This went on for weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI hoped this beautiful Amanda Lopez (who I assumed lived in Orlando or Queens, not the Philippines!) would find me on Facebook with my unusual surname, which she did,‚Äù Mr. Ciesielski said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the Covid pandemic prevalent around the globe at the time and being half a world away from each other, their relationship developed via phone calls and video chats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe mostly use English but the words that express exactly what we mean at any given time simply do not exist, and so we do our best to approximate,‚Äù said Ms. Lopez, who writes brand and communications content for an accounting firm in Manila.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúBecause we were worlds apart, we used the language of creativity to strengthen our connection,‚Äù said Mr. Ciesielski, who visited Manila in July 2022 and met Ms. Lopez in person for the first time. ‚ÄúWe would create new words together, often blending Tagalog and English to inspire brand-new neologisms.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúAmanda taught me that ‚Äòtampo‚Äô is a Tagalog word that describes the state of being emotionally bruised and making it known to the offending party,‚Äù said Mr. Ciesielski, an event florist manager in Washington. ‚ÄúIn other words, it‚Äôs being especially sensitive and demonstratively upset. Since I claim to be some sort of poet, we came up with ‚Äòtampoet‚Äô to indicate a sad poet.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThe Tagalog word ‚Äòkilig‚Äô refers to the exhilaration brought about by a romantic experience and does not exist in English,‚Äù Ms Lopez said. ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äògiggle,‚Äô which means ‚Äòto laugh lightly, nervously, or in a silly way,‚Äô does not have a direct counterpart in Tagalog. Rob actually created the word ‚Äòkiliggle‚Äô ‚Äî which is the giggle that accompanies feelings of ‚Äòkilig.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Ciesielski, who married Ms. Lopez on Jan. 18 in Manila, said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs enlightened me on concepts like ‚Äòlambing,‚Äô which means to sweetly caress and hug.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMs. Lopez, who said she speaks, writes, and thinks in both Tagalog and English, refers to Mr. Ciesielski as ‚Äúmahal ko,‚Äù which is Tagalog for ‚Äúmy love,‚Äù or to be more specific, ‚Äúlove of mine.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòMahal ko‚Äô to me,‚Äù Ms. Lopez said, ‚Äújust feels a tad more ‚Äòkilig!‚Äô‚Äù",

Users can write down what they are good at and what they want to learn about, then get matched with someone who can teach them something about their interests and wants to learn from them. \n\nThe teaching/learning is supposed to be casual, and not formal, otherwise, one can pursue some professional course. This app is ideal for non-native English speakers looking to practice their language skills, or for native speakers wanting to just learn something new or have some fun. \n\nOf course when I say ‚Äúa field you are good at‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt mean you are expected to be an expert in that topic. It could be something like ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù or just ‚ÄúLife hacks‚Äù. \n\nI want to build this app since my friends and I are excited about it, but I want to improve its core idea first and get your feedback about it. \n\nThank you for your time!",

Specifically, the first question part of the \"Compr√©hension des √©crits\".  I've been using the \"R√©ussir le Delf\" book by Gilles Breton et al.\n\nThe first question in this section always has you read some items and then check boxes in a table - menus at restaurants, vacation destination descriptions, and in this case book reviews.  My question is: how am I meant to check the boxes if the item at hand is not mentioned in the document?  It's been such a variety on the practice questions - in some instances all boxes are checked, in some there were question marks if it wasn't discussed, and on this question I just did, for the first time they just left the boxes blank.  I checked \"non\" on my practice test if the item wasn't discussed, because it wasn't there.  That's a \"non\" to me.\n\nOf note:  The prompt for this question says: \"Dans le tabelau ci-dessous, cochez les cases lorsqu'un livre correspond aux crit√®res √©nonc√©s\".  Is this my missing context?  Because it says \"lorsqu'un\" I leave it blank if it doesn't apply?\n\nMerci in advanced, this is all making my analytical brain feel like exploding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Blanks in the answer columns on the answer key](https://preview.redd.it/65qzw462f5ia1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bc0fbc166fc48c2cf8bcdc2ea7a7ca413ff84a2e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Question marks when information was not given](https://preview.redd.it/w5vl0zg7f5ia1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=541f43e2b8ded4cceeb34f97b9e29a43154ded87)",

At least with me it works. I can make 2 years break from French and whenever I decide to come back for a couple of days I am always at the same level I was years ago when I just stopped learning. It made me take French for granted, feeling I can learn it fully whenever I want to without much effort on my part, so I started learning German instead. \n\nBut as a beginner in German I feel like I finally reached that small level when I can understand sentences or even stop fearing grammar. But I'm not A1 yet. I made a 3 day break and came back today worrying I'll forget whatever progress I made during these 2 weeks of studying.\n\nI'm going to try to learn and update if I feel my skills became any worse than they were 3-4 days ago.",

I don‚Äôt like the guy‚Äôs American accent, but im not going to be too picky rn because it‚Äôs actually been beneficial. Im also listening to Spanish music (I have a fire playlist) to gain a more poetic understanding of Spanish. When i finish this podcast, ill move on to some other ones I‚Äôve heard of, like News in Slow Spanish, a zero to a hero, etc. If i had time, I‚Äôd watch TV. Would it be beneficial to watch an episode per week?\n\nMy strategy is a somewhat natural approach using lots of immersion. I want to get the gist of what people are saying, and then attribute meanings to words in my head, much like children do. I want my speech to feel natural. I also am mixing in Spanish dictionaries to learn unknown words, hoping i can speed up the immersion process, by having a basis of another language to explain things to me. Also my phone ui is Spanish \n\nMy TL is specifically informal latin American Spanish. I don‚Äôt much care about being proper, and i don‚Äôt want Castillian tendencies either. As if rn i have an ok grasp on grammar, so vocab building is probably the most effective thing ill have to do. I understand most of what is going on in the podcast, but not every WORD.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and suggestions? Have you tried a similar method? Should i do something different? Floor is open:",

I realized that German speakers speak really good English and don't seem to care if you speak German or not. It was useful in some cases with older folks, and some people seemed to appreciate the interest/effort, but it was not really all that handy.\n\nBasically, I'm just wondering how other English speaking German learners have dealt with this apparent road block. I would also like to learn other languages like Russian, Italian or French, so I can't help but feeling like German might be a waist of time, considering that the speakers of other languages I'm interested in also speak English at a lower rate, which would seem to make these languages more useful.\n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated üëç\n\nThanks!",

I can read regular Spanish well and I'm beginning to understand it spoken quite well. The thing is that everyone said Spanish would be useful as an American but it isn't. I work at a plant with over 1000 people and probably 20% of them only speak Spanish. Those people tend to just avoid gringos at all costs because 9 out of 10 gringos don't speak Spanish, and I get it. But if I have to talk to them about something work related, I know enough Spanish to do that easily. But usually they just look really surprised and even confused that I spoke Spanish, and then they just reply in extremely broken English even if I tell them they can talk to me in Spanish. The native speakers of Spanish that I know personally will have no problem helping me with a particular word or phrase but they don't often talk to me in Spanish beyond a sentence or two. I'm beginning to think that it'll be once in a blue moon that I actually get to use my target language to help someone in the real world and not for personal enjoyment, but one of the biggest reasons I learned Spanish was because I felt for the struggle of immigrants who don't speak English and I wanted to help them and I wanted them to feel more welcome in America.",
