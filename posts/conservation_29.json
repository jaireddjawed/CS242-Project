        "text": "I just recently got my associates degree in Horticulture this past Feb. I decided to get my bachelors degree.\n\nI wanted to do something with nature and decided to do environmental science- Life Science Option. \"The Life Science Option is designed to prepare a student for jobs in environmental biology which have something to do with the impact of modern technology and change on life forms. These include working as pollution monitoring technicians for various public agencies such as county and state health departments, as well as state and national environmental protection agencies; students may also find themselves attracted to jobs with local, regional and national nature conservation agencies, both public and private. These jobs may involve monitoring endangered species, evaluating habitat, making inventories of wildlife, or interpreting nature as a ranger in public or private environmental education center.\" \n\nOne of my main concerns is the job opportunities available. I plan to move to WA state once I am done with my degree.  \nDo you guys have any advice for the path that I'm taking? \n\nThank you. \n\n ",

        "text": "Hunting has long played a role in the conservation movement.  The website below from the *Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation* lists 25 reasons why hunting is conservation.   \n\nImportant in the conservation perspective are principles such as sustainable yield, carrying capacity, and population rebound.  These concepts enter into land managers' decisions on setting hunting seasons and bag limits.\n\nPreservation is sometimes defined as being associated with the protection of buildings and objects, but in a natural resources sense it means maintaining the present state of ecosystems. Preservation theoretically is focused on natural resources that have not been touched by humans.  But given that humans have impacted or degraded such large areas of the planet, it is now regularly used to refer to a permanent halt to all resource extraction--hunting, gathering, logging, mining, etc.--in a modified environment.  If preservation is strictly interpreted, any human presence in the environment is deemed objectionable.\n\nIncreasingly it seems segments of the conservation movement are adopting a more preservationist perspective.  An example might be repeated decisions against delisting an animal from endangered species laws *(to the point where resource managers defacto agree that hunting of the animal will never resume).*\n\nThe increasing involvement of animal rights activists in conservation projects, such as the activism to prevent Australian shark populations from being culled, seems another example of this drift to *no use or impacts.*  Animal rights activism, ethically-based, combines with the science-based conservation perspective for mutual goals. Comments?\n\n\nhttp://www.rmef.org/Conservation/HuntingIsConservation/25ReasonsWhyHuntingIsConservation.aspx",

We floated the idea last year of turning the list (270+ species) into a useable field guide, but some board members weren't too keen on it for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe've returned to the idea, and I'm interested to know what your thoughts are. We are a ranching collaborative; of our 425,000 acres (171991.398 ha) of managed cattle ranch lands, nearly half is federal, a quarter is state, and the rest is private. We collaborate with every agency, local universities, and other groups doing research and monitoring on the lands for a variety of reasons, and a plant guide is always useful.\n\nThe main argument against making our own guide is that a nearby ranch created a guide a few years ago and were we to make our own it'd seem like we were copying them. But, most of that ranch is in different ecological zones than we are (so some plants don't overlap), and their guide isn't so useful for researchers (at least not the way we want it). I'm just starting to look into how other guides are structured now, so this is the beginning of my search.\n\nAny comments or questions would be appreciated!\n\n---\n\n*I am posting this from my 'official' account, but know that I am a long-time Redditor and post in this sub frequently.*",

I haven't decided my major, and was wondering what my optios would be. \n\nIf I go into a BSc in geography focusing on physical geography then what would that career path look like? Will I be able to work on environmental conservation projects for small NGO's? Anybody with a similar experience have any insight? Would I be better off pursuing a Biology or Ecology degree (I have an interest in those fields as well as anything related to environmental/earth sciences)? I understand GIS is all the rage in geography right now but what is that job like in the real world?\n\nSpecifically I want to work on regeneration and preservation of ecosystems such as tropical rainforests and coral reefs. I also have an interest in urban planning and sustainable urban development, both in developed and developing countries.\n\nMy university offers at least 2 \"field trips\" in the geography department to work on various international projects which involves field work. There is no such gauranteed opportunity in the Bio department, however I have a good scholarship that pays for a significant portion of my tuition and living costs so I will be able to volunteer or work for free for at least a few months during/after my degree because of the saved money (got very lucky I know). \n\nAny help/guidance would be appreciated\n\nEdit: If I do go into Geography could I realistically go to a Master's in Ecology?

I've been offered a new job in both fields but the clean energy job is a more financially sound choice. Am I shooting myself in the foot staying in energy? Is it better to try to make the switch now even if it means less pay in a higher cost of living location?
