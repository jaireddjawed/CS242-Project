How can they, being at least somewhat knowledgeable in phonology and grammar, not see just how false that idea is? Sure, you often come across comparisons between Sanskrit and Slavic languages, well that makes *some* sense, even more so with Baltic, since they are all Satem languages, but whenever you bring in western IE languages it all falls apart.\n\nHow do you derive Germanic /k/ from /d͡ʑ/ for starters? Having an underlying /g/ is just so close at hand and anyone knowledgeable in languages can see that.",

If it seems this bad for me as a layman, how bad must it be for somebody who is actually educated in let's say IE studies and classical Greek to be \"corrected\" by some jingoistic Greek when he would pronounce classical greek \"wrong\"",

        "text": "Hello my friends. Earlier today an innocent idle google brought me to a website with the interesting title of \"truthwiki\". Truthwiki has interesting perspectives on many topics, [one of which is language](http://www.truthwiki.org/language_and_consciousness/).\n\n&gt;The amount of reality we can grasp is extended or limited by the level of language that we have developed. \n\nR4: The strong Sapir-Whorf theory is not taken seriously by linguists. \n\n&gt;The literal, exterior, or outer form level (the world of nouns, facts and the past). This is the level of language that is utilized by most of us, 99.9% of the time. It communicates the materialistic outer form of things, objects, and processes. In professional consulting, this is the point where the consultant listens to the timeline story told by the client and is confronted with a linear sequence of words to interpret and assimilate in order to respond.\n\nR4: I don't know what this means but I don't think linguists would agree.\n\n&gt;This level of language awareness provides us with the capacity to consciously enter into the creative process because we now have an understanding of the nature of cycles, how they interact, and an understanding of their resultant effects. At this level, the DNA chain is understood as a universe of energy systems (genes equal stars, nucleotides equal planets) whose interactive fields provide the guiding matrix shaping a physical form which then attracts to it a level of consciousness relevant to its complexity and refinement. The consultant who operates on this plane of understanding has reached the level of becoming a real ‘thinker’ and not a ‘reactor’.\n\nR4: I don't know what this means but I don't think linguists OR biologists OR astronomers would agree.\n\n&gt;Speaking or vocalizing written words (reading out loud) is a recent development in human history. In an earlier era Sanskrit, Chinese, and Hebrew (inner Egyptian) were evolved to express the third level described above. They were not intended to be spoken and so there was not the necessity for vowels as we use them today. These languages were associational pictographic symbol systems capable of conveying, transmitting, and evoking profound concepts and awakening sublime understanding.\n\nR4: No natural language is more capable of conveying profound concepts and awaking sublime understanding than any other. Moreover, there is no linguistic or historical basis for calling Hebrew \"inner Egyptian\". And also Sanskrit, Chinese, and Hebrew were (and still are) spoken. The fact that most vowels in Hebrew are not written down does mean anything mystical. I'm struggling to find the connection between these three languages. Were they selected at random?\n\n&gt;It does not mean we should not have new terms and words: we need them. Sometimes, in fact, our new words hit the mark more than their inventors are aware. The name ‘RADAR’ is quite appropriate to its function and nature. A simplistic translation of the word would be: “A ray is sent out (RA), strikes an object (D), and is reflected back (AR).” Those who study Hebrew as a hieroglyphic symbol system will recognize that the implication of the roots; (Resh-Aleph), (Resh-Daleth),(Resh-Resh), etc; contained in the word ‘radar’ are indicative of the very principles on which it operates.\n\nR4: RADAR is an acronym from English and has no connected to anything in Hebrew. There is no implication from those roots, which are not roots and are not Hebrew. (Hebrew roots consist of three letters.)",
