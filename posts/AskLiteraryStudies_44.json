I found some interesting ideas and concepts in other disciplines like Foucaults heterotopia or the research on imagined geographies that is happening in Human Geographies (James Kneale is a good author to start with, if you are interested).\nBut it seems that Literary Studies themselves are still a bit blind on that spot. Of course, there is that whole postcolonial thing that started with Edward Said, but it seems to me, that their concepts are hard to use in a context that has no relation to colonialism. Besides that i only found Michail Bakhtins essay on the chronotope, that is both: Very interesting and quite esoteric.\nWhat am i missing? Do you happen to have some recommendations?\nThanks for reading this and sorry for the bad english, i am actually a germanist from, big surprise, germany ^^",

What got me thinking about this was a similar quote from Benjamin Franklin's autobiography that came to mind: \n\n\"... if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. This sum may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument.\" [[1](http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page61.htm)]\n\nI'd be very interested to learn of previous examples of this principle or of potential inspirations for them. Can anyone offer assistance?\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "(I searched a bit and didn't find any posts like this, so my apologies if this is redundant.)\n\nIn high school, I attended a creative writing program at my state arts school. It did a much better job of introducing me to the study of literature than any English class I took in high school. In my time there, though, I failed to develop one skill that I'm now beginning to wish I had: taking notes on the text while reading. I always hated the idea of writing in my books (still do), so I never took notes in English classes; I carried this over to the creative writing program, which was possible because all of the tests comprised fairly directed open-book essays. This gave me time to mull over the text and decide how to approach the topic, and, when we had our discussions (usually the day following the test), I would be prepared to join the conversation thanks mainly to the thought that went into taking the test.\n\nHowever, I'm finding myself a bit more challenged in university. I'll read the book as I'm used to doing it, taking no notes, but when it comes time to discuss in class I find myself almost silent. I suspect this is because I'm no longer forced to engage with the text beforehand like I was while taking the tests back in the writing program. It's not that I'm really forgetting any of the factual details about character or plot; I just find I have very little to add to a discussion.\n\nThen, when it comes time to write a paper (unprompted, unlike the ones I had to write in the writing program), I find myself lost entirely. I've done well on the few that I've done so far, but the premises for those papers only came after a few hours of me flipping back through the text, trying to latch on to some idea. This feels way too scattered to keep doing, and I know there's a better way.\n\nI think the answer to both of these problems would be to take notes while I'm reading. I'm about to put this to the test by rereading Tolstoy's *Childhood* (which we just read, so it's fresh in my mind) and taking notes. Does anybody have any tips, particularly when it comes to filtering what's important to take not of? I'm concerned that I'm going to end up writing down far too many minor details and end up with a bunch of disordered ideas that will be no more helpful than flipping through the book was.\n\ntl;dr: I've never bothered taking notes before while reading a book; I think it's holding me back; I want to start now, so I'm looking for advice.",

        "text": "Hey there, /r/askliterarystudies, I hope I am in the right place here to ask a question about a book we are reading in English class (I am from Germany, so bear with my English). Now this has really nothing to do with homework or assignments but just a question that came up when we discussed the phrase \"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\"\n\nIt's right at the beginning of the second chapter and refers to the protagonists \"ability\" to change what time in his life he experiences, although without him being able to control when it happens and to where he travels in time. We haven't talked about the \"ability\" a lot yet but as far as I understood it, it's a mix of his post traumatic stress disorder he got during/after the Second World War and the plane crash he survived 20 years after, where he hit his head and lost his wife in another traumatic accident right after. \n\nBut the problem lies in pinpointing when he actually got the \"ability\" to experience past events in his life. In chapter two, it says \"Billy says that he first came unstuck in time in 1944, long before his trip to Tralfamadore.\" But he says that in the context of him being on a radio show in 1968, right after his plane crash. Surely, it would mean that until the plane crash, he wasn't able to \"come unstuck in time\" but the first event he can jump back to, is in 1944. In this case, he would not be telling the truth in the radio show because before the plane crash he never seemed to go back in time, since his wife (or was it his daughter?) remarked that he changed so much since the accident and it was only then when he invented his story about the aliens, who view time just like he does. \n\nMy teacher and lots of people in my class agreed that he seemed to have the \"ability\" (basically the trauma) the first time in 1944 and that this was the time that triggered his ability to \"come unstuck in time\". But in the protagonists small biography in the beginning of chapter 2, it never said that he gained this \"ability\" in 1944 but he talked about it the first time in 1968.\n\nThis is really complicated, due to the time travelling, so I hope I could make you understand the issue.\n\nThanks for your answers in advance.\n\nEdit: Corrected some grammar and spelling",

The last thing I was reading about a group of people about to undertake a pilgrimage to mecca. \n\nI feel like I'm missing a lot in this story.  I don't have much background in abrahamic religions, including Islam.\n\nA key thing I don't understand is how the two main characters, Gibreel and Saladin come to be an angel and devil.  I can see that Gibreel is being treated like an angel, and Saladin like a devil, or at least an imp.  I don't see if there is something about them that makes them good or bad.  At first I thought it was a kind of irony, because Saladin is treated so poorly in England, that really he should be treated like an angel instead?  Are they supposed to be modern day representations of the same battle going on in the dream sequences?\n\nSpeaking of dream sequences - so far I see it like this: Islam is brought into the city, and it's a threat because of it's monotheism.  Islam does battle with some representative gods of hindu polytheism and generally gains ground.  Then, for some reason, Islamic leaders go to another town and from there decide to take a pilgrimage to Mecca.  Except it's suddenly no longer ancient times, but modern.  (the reluctant man says ~take my car to get there faster~, despite all previous references being to carts and walking and ships, not planes).\n\nSo, what background am I missing?  Will I understand it better as I go along?\n\nThanks",

The task of interpreting the dialect puts my mind in overdrive for the full length of the play, and that's just to process the literal meaning of what's being said. I've been told I need to just loosen up, but I'd really like to know how 'loosely' or distantly the original audiences were listening. It's one thing to muse over one of Shakespeare's lines at one's own pace and with a scholarly edition, but how on earth did the original Elizabethan audience do it with _no text_ and in _real time_!? (Not to mention standing upright in the dirt, in rainy English weather!) Did they pay to see the same play multiple times? Did they take notes? Did their illiteracy free up some part of their brain for super verbal processing powers? \n\nI happen to be trained in textual interpretation, but it can still takes me _hours_ to unpack a single poem or chapter or prose; and that's with the aid of an ever-present _text_ that I can read back-to-front in my own time. How the fuck did an illiterate peasantry do it _in real time_!!? Relative to Shakespeare's implied or ideal reader (or listener, I suppose) I actually feel like I have a learning disability. I'm not kidding. (See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZhRf2fxlyw---this is _exactly_ how I feel.) Going to see Shakespeare is like playing a video game on \"nightmare\" mode: \"You didn't quite get that line? Well tough shit, that was your _one_ opportunity to hear it, and now it's gone---now keep up with the next line or you'll miss that too.\" And even when by some miracle I manage to parse the literal sense of a line, I can't afford to explore its multiple meanings without risking a 'micro-daydream' that obliterates the next five lines of dialogue.",

Am I way off base?\n\nFoucault vs. Nietzsche:\n\n* Regulation of individual's power vs. Individual's instinctive drive for power\n\n* Internalized \"concepts\" of power vs. \"Truth (like power) based on interior \"illusions\"\n\n* Control is effected through perception vs. No \"right\" perception\n\n* \"Knowledge-power relations\" vs. \"It is the powerful who made the names of things into law..\"\n\n* Categorization of the \"Leper\" vs. \"The inventive force that invented categories labored in the service of... our need for security...\" \n\n\nMy general thrust, I suppose, is that the power of the signifier confers power on those who do the signifying (for example when the State declares a man \"insane\" society adapts a new set of principles by which it deals with that man). Yet, I feel like I'm off in the weeds with that approach, almost as if I'm being distracted by their philosophy instead of how it applies to literary criticism.\n\nCan anyone with a greater understanding of these two authors point me in a general direction? This is my first graduate level class and I feel like I may be missing something.\n\nThanks for any and all pointers!\n\n",

I recognize that Blindness is a trait used in literature to emphasize strengths, morally or otherwise, as well as being used to symbolize a greater weakness of character, or moral/emotional blindness, as seen in the latter part of *Oedipus Rex*. All I am really wondering is how exactly does blindness contribute as a theme to Literature in general, and why is it so important, aside from my aforementioned common symbolisms that I have already noticed.

During the past few semesters, I developed a passion for stories and poems about King Arthur. I even went so far as to write a music album on *Le Morte D'Arthur*. I have been thinking about applying for grad school lately, and when I stumbled upon Bangor University's MA program for Arthurian literature, I fell in love with the idea. Just to give you a bit more information, the two professors at the head of the program have produced books on the subject in addition to creating the  International Arthurian Society and its relative journal. Here are a few questions I'm hoping you can shed light on:\n\n1) As I intend to eventually go for a phD and teach at the university level, would a degree in Arthurian literature \"pigeon-hole\" me into too specific of an area?\n\n2) I am a military vet and an above-average student with a 3.9 GPA. Should I be paying for grad school with loans, or is it possible to get a full-ride scholarship with my accomplishments? It seems my only option at Bangor is an international scholarship that reduces my tuition by 50% and loans to cover the rest.\n\n3) Are UK master's degrees generally equated with US master's degrees? I may decide to return to the US for a phD if the cost of staying in the UK becomes too high. \n\n4) Any other expert input is most welcome :)",

For all we know we got some of his less good plays.\n\nImagine if most of Shakespeare's works had been lost, and we judged him on King John, The Phoenix and the Turtle, and some of the less good sonnets.\n\nWhat would be the impact on world literature, study, history, etc. if some excavation in Greece or Turkey found some cave or chest with most if not all of the lost \"plays\" of the Greek dramatists, philosophers, etc. in well preserved form?  Something analogous to Dead Sea Scrolls, only on much bigger scale.  Just going down the list in wikipedia of classical lost works, there's a ton of stuff that was lost to the world.\n\nWould it perhaps lead to a renewal in classical studies with a wealth of new works to be analyzed, discussed, etc.?

        "text": "Dear literature heads, I have been trying to grasp the concept of post-structuralism over the last few days, and although I have studied it thoroughly I have trouble understanding how to apply post-structuralism (my main reference point is Derrida's \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\") to the reading of a text. \n\nAs I understand it, post-structuralism is more of a philosophic movement rather than a literary one when it comes to the center anchoring structures and allowing it to play, and an \"event\" happening that changes the structure. A post-structuralist would think using scientific methods to understand literature are naive, they would be fixed on the material aspect of language, and they are anxious about achieving knowledge through language.\n\nToday someone deconstructed e.e. cummings' [in Just-] for me, by looking at Richard Kennedy's view on the poem. Kennedy says in *Dreams in the Mirror: A Biography of e.e. cummings* that \"Spring thaws filled a low spot in the street... with a huge puddle, a \"mud luscious\" site. In years to come, the memory of this annual occurrence plus the advent of the balloon-seller, blowing his whistle, and the remembered joy of childhood play coalesce to inspire e.e. cummings' best known poem \"in Just-/spring\"...\"  As I understood it, Kennedy created a structure and implied a core, as he says that the centre (of the text?) is about the joy of childhood. Furthermore, he looks at the old world versus the young world, maturity versus immaturity and innocence versus sexuality. And then there's the post-structuralist view, who would focus more on the sexual tension in the text, about how the balloon man tries to lure the children into sexuality and about the orgasmic joy in child's play. A post structuralist would look for elements that refer to the fact that language is unstable. An \"event\" that would be happening in the poem is something strange that happens all of a sudden, so maybe these would be the inconsistencies on a textual level: the old balloonman suddenly turning into the balloonMan. (I'm not really sure if I get this right!).\n\nI'm wondering if you could correct me where needed, and explain to me as how to analyse a text this way myself? It made sense to me when someone else did it for me, but I now have to deconstruct an assigned text (metafiction) myself, interpreting it and fixing a centre then *subverting* it, and I don't really know where to start. I think I understand how to analyse poems like cummings' now but applying post-structuralism to metafiction (in the story I have to analyse, the author comments on the story's progress as he goes) has me completely lost for words, let alone 500! Any tips would be massively appreciated! \n\nThank you in advance and apologies for the sea of words but I really don't know how to explain my problem of not understanding post-structuralism briefly, but I guess I'm just trying to \"do\" a Derrida!

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI was wondering what you thought of publishing incomplete or previously unpublished works by dead authors. Is it ethical to publish something that the author may not have intended to? How can the editing process work if the author isn't there to insure his/her wishes are respected? \n\nThe problem is even more prickly when the author specifically requests his/her works to be destroyed. Kafka, if I remember, wanted his works destroyed, so we wouldn't be able to read the Metamorphosis if someone hadn't decided to ignore the author's wishes. \n\nUnfinished things like \"Bartleby the Scrivener\" by Melville are also presented to readers in a deceptive way. By being published separately, with a title and all the trappings of a completed book, it makes it seem like the author intended it to be published this way - when that is far from the truth. A great example of this is Flaubert's \"Bouvard et Pecuchet\" which is always published as a stand-alone novel. However, we have no idea HOW Flaubert wanted to publish it, since it was found along with a number of other odd texts, like a satirical dictionary and a well-curated list of quotes. We have no way of knowing that we are accurately interpreting his work, since we don't know its context.\n\nThe last question that this brings up is, are we ever properly reading a posthumous book? Or, in a more generous phrasing, what does reading a posthumous book do to your interpretation of it? \n\nThis is more of a discussion topic than a question. I just wanted to hear your thoughts. Also I'd love to hear about more books whose publication history is plagued with posthumous editing. \n\nEDIT: OK, great talk guys see you later. ",
