        "text": "I work for a company (tv provider) that has one of those policies that under no circumstances are we to release a call no matter how irrational or nasty the people are to us. Now I can take these idiots bashing me, call me whatever you like, a liar, cheat, crook, scammer I don't give a fuck, odds are I'm tuning you out until you shut up. Tonight was a bit different... When you bring my family into your hissy fit over having to wait for a technician to fix your shit, that's a line no one should ever cross. I only put up with the endless bullshit for my family. \n\nRA:  Raging Asshole\n\nFast forwarding through the troubleshooting (signal loss, pretty typical)\n\n\"Ok Mr RA, I'm going to set up your appointment for the technician to visit your home to resolve this issue so we can get your services restored. Now it looks like we are a week out to 8/4/2016 and unfortunately that is the absolute earliest date we currently have available.\"\n\nRA:  \"That is completely unacceptable for a loyal, paying customer!  (insert meaningless rant about years with us, how much his bill is and how I MUST fix it)\"\n\n\"I am so sorry Mr. RA, I have absolutely no control over earlier dates, while we do greatly appreciate your loyalty and prompt payments this has no effect on available date as they are first come first serve. However, there are a few things you can do to check for other available dates or cancellations.\"\n\nRA:  \"I just don't understand how you expect me to go a week without tv (according to him it's been this way for months, what's another week?  Go outside) and I need someone here tomorrow or I'll cancel.\"\n\n\"Mr. RA we'd hate to lose a valued customer such as yourself (bye) but as I've already stated I cannot get you an earlier date.\"\n\nRA:  \"(insert more raging about loyalty and his bill)\"\n\n\"Mr. RA, I understand you are frustrated but we need to proceed with a decision on what'd you'd like to do, either we can schedule a technician or I can transfer you to a specialist to process your cancellation.\"\n\nRA:  \"You know, it's people like you that I wish the worst things to, I hope something happens to your family so you can understand how I'm feeling right now.\"\n\nNow I've never yelled at a customer, loud sure but never yelled, I don't know how loud I was but I did notice afterwards people from a decent ways away were peering in my direction. \n\n\"Mr. RA, I know you are experiencing some frustration and I've been nothing but professional and courteous to you. Comparing your tv issues to ill wishes toward my family is not something I'm prepared to tolerate in the slightest.  Now we cannot release calls but...\"\n\nRA:  \"Sir my tv is impor...\"\n\n\"Nope, you've had your opportunity to speak your mind and now you'll be listening to me!  This call is over, you will no longer be speaking to me, I've escalated your account to a supervisor and you can voice your concerns to them but we are done speaking (click).\"\n\nI don't care about any corrective actions, I've already made plans to leave but this may speed that process as I've already printed several resumes and began going over our financials. I'm sorry but this job is not that important to deal with people like this daily.  ",

        "text": "Whenever I tell someone I work at a call center, I always get sympathy. Until, that is, I tell them I love my job. Then I get disbelief.\n\nBut its true! For years I worked in the court system. Then I ended up having to leave for family reasons, and had trouble getting a job. I ended up in a call center that everyone else thought was awful. I wasn't a fan of a lot of things about it - mostly management related. But I LOVED my job. It was there that I discovered my real love for customer service.\n\nThen after a year I moved, and ended up in a call center for a utility. I cannot think of another job I would rather have - except perhaps a librarian/bookstore owner.\n\nManagement is awesome. I never see my boss except for twice a year evals and when I go looking for her. When I do, she is always pleasant. My old boss in this same company was talking to another sup when I came by looking for her. She immediately dropped her conversation with that sup and handled what I needed with pleasant efficiency. They treat us like customers. EVERY time I have gone to them with an issue it has been handled - not always in a way I like but they are honest and pay serious attention to it.\n\nSo management is awesome - but I really love dealing with customers. Our company gives us wide latitude in our decisions. I have broken company policy left and right to help customers I felt needed/deserved it, and the only time I got called out on it was when I didn't note why - and they just asked me to note why I made that decision in the future.\n\nSo I am free to help my customers as much as it pleases me - and I am also free to tell them no when what they want will not actually help them - i.e. kicking that three month past due bill down to the \"next payday\" for you.\n\nWorking for a utility I get a wide variety of customers - from adorable sweet old women who lost their husbands two months ago and just need a friendly voice to speak with, to the enraged man shrieking like a 12 year old girl at a bieiber concert (is he still the thing?) over something not working properly that isn't even HIS!\n\nI am fortunate in my reaction to the \"volatile\" customers - I am notorious in my center for placing myself on mute so my screaming and cussing customers can't hear me laughing at them.\n\nI just needed to post this tonight because it's been a rough month for me. I haven't been feeling well, and have had the worst overall stats this month I have had in a long time. I had my mid-year eval with my sup today and she comforted me, telling me they weren't THAT bad and when mixed in with my other good scores I still was scoring better than most.\n\nBut I needed to remind myself that I DO love my job - and why. I am so fortunate. I come here so often giggling over the customer horror stories because I have the same ones. But it always bothers me to hear how people hate their jobs. I am so lucky to have one I love. I just needed to remind myself of that today.",

        "text": "My call center wasn't even that bad of a place. It was inbound calls for tech support and we got paid 10.5/H at 40 hours a week. Second most I've ever made(12.50 being my highest).\n\nThis place is hell. The turn over rate is INSANE! We started with a training class of 32 and yesterday the total head-count(Me included) was 9 employees left! Just after 2 months of working! \n\nThe disorganization is jaw-dropping. We switched to another building(2 separate buildings right across the street from each other) and when I got to work, there were no computers open for me so they sent me home without pay and it counted against my attendance record. I was 1 out of 10(In the whole building) people who got sent home for not having a computer available. The first 3 checks I've gotten(My only checks) I've had hours not count and had to fight with the payroll team and HR to get them corrected. When I was first hired they scheduled me Thur and Friday off and said \"YOUR SCHEDULE IS SET IN STONE, DO NOT EXPECT IT TO CHANGE FOR THE FIRST 180 DAYS AND DO NOT ASK FOR A CHANGE BEFORE THAT PERIOD!\", I didn't mind too much and got my life moved around a bit, well 2 months later...guess what? Schedule change! Not to mention if it's a \"busy\" day at the building, parking is first come first serve. I've had times where I've had to park 1/4th a mile away and walk to work.\n\nAfter all that, I have other problems. The hours are horrid. They literally ruin my whole day. 2:45-11:15PM and mix that in with the 30 minute, one way commute. Leaving at 2:10 and not getting home till 11:45, your week is spent literally working and sleeping. People don't understand that's it's hard to just fall asleep after a call center day. I usually can't sleep till around 3AM.\n\nNow lets move onto the RULES they set. They are very strict. No phones, any paper products, anything that could write, any electronic period, nor can we be on third-party websites(There's an approved list that we can look at, and they're all internal company tools). Now think about that for a minute, that means for 8 hours a day, you are doing nothing but working. Straight work. You can't read a book, look at reddit for a minute, color, or do literally ANYTHING besides work. If you're caught with any of those \"security violations\" then you are walked out of the building for the day with no pay. Now I would understand if we actually had confidential information, but for Tier 1 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. All I can write down is your name and address or phone number! That's it! Now I get all of that, I might be able to live with that but tell me something, if we have all these \"security measures\" in place...WHY DO WE HAVE \"AT-HOME\" ADVISORS WHO GET TO WORK WITH NO SUPERVISION?!\n\nMoving on from that, management is a power-tripping group. My team leader is literally 20 years old and goes out of his way to make sure you know he's the \"boss\". Example; I went over 2 minutes on lunch and had to take 25 minutes out of my day to talk about why I was trying to avoid work and what steps I need to take to correct myself.\n\nToday I quit. I called in and told them that I was no longer needing them for any employment and that my life deserved something better. I have never been happier. I went out to the lake, lit a joint, and starting fishing. \n\nLet's see how stressful the job market is tomorrow though...",

Until then, no, you won't have any email access\n\n**Mr. Awkward**: Thanks for nothing. You can explain to my manager why I'm not working\n\n**Me**: Sir, I have no magic button to fix this issue. As I've already explained you'll need to grant me remote access or at the very least have the laptop in front of you so I can talk you through some troubleshooting. There's really nothing I can do unless you have the laptop on your person. You mentioned it was in another room, can't you just go and get it?\n\n**Mr. Awkward**: NO! That would take far too long. This is ridiculous *click*\n\n -----------------------\n\n45 mins later he calls back and unfortunately gets through to me, but clearly doesn't realise it.\n\n**Mr. Awkward**: Yes, my email isn't working.

I already know what the problem is and how to fix it from that highly detailed explanation you just provided.*\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that your TV doesn't work. I'd be more than happy to assist you with that, but I need to ask a few questions to better assist you. Is that ok?\n\nIAH: Sure.\n\nMe: Thank you. First and foremost, can I have your name please? \n\nIAH: Irresponsible as hell. Last name spelled H-E-L-L.\n\nMe: Thank you, Mr. IAH. Before we get started, I first need to pull up your account. So can you provide me with the phone number on your account please?\n\nIAH: I don't know it.\n\nMe: Ok, that's fine, how about the address.\n\nIAH: I'm not sure, I'm renting this place for the summer and it shows up as unit B.\n\n*At this point I'm dumbfounded.

The name on the account is [SOME OTHER PERSON WITH A VERY COMMON NAME], this is their property.\n\nMe: I understand that, but in order to assist you I do need to pull the account up, so can you look on the back of your cable box and read the MAC address? I should be able to find the account that way.\n\nIAH: I'm actually not there right now, but I was hoping you could just send a signal to the box or something and see if that fixes it.\n\n*Are you fucking kidding me right now? At this point, I'm prepared to \"accidentally\" disconnect this call.*\n\nMe: (composes self) Well we would certainly need to pull the account up first before sending any signals.\n\nIAH: Can't you just look it up by his name?\n\n*The account holder's name was like John Smith or something else common. Yeah, I'm definitely going to sift through our entire database of thousands of \"John Smiths\" to then attempt to guess the address since you apparently don't know that either.*\n\nMe: (not here for that) To ensure accurate results, we would need either the account number, phone number, address, or equipment MAC address to pull the account. \n\nIAH: This is ridiculous!  I've been on hold for nearly half an hour and now you're telling me you can't even find the account! \n\n*So you had half an hour to get your shit together but chose to waste our time instead by playing who's got the button? Get off my phone.*\n\nMe: (head is literally on desk at this point) I definitely apologize for the long wait, but I would need to pull up the account to assist you.\n\nIAH: Well, my name's supposed to be on the account can you look it up by my name?\n\n*Sir, this is a personal data account. Just because you're added as authorized on the account, it's not as though your name is \"tagged\" to the account. This isn't Twitter, genius.*\n\nMe: (over this call) Unfortunately, our systems are only able to search via account holder information. However, you've stated that you're not home at this time, and we would need you home with the equipment to go through proper troubleshooting steps and verify if the steps taken were successful in resolving your issue or not. Please give us a call back once you're on site with the equipment. Is there anything else that I can help you with?\n\nIAH: Apparently not! *click*\n\n*Blood pressure goes up 10 points*",

Usually it means the number once was in our system but a company or office changed their answering service or number but the old one is still forwarded to us for some reason. 9/10 times, theres nothing I can do for these people except tell them they have an incorrect number.

Also, sometimes people dial the wrong number from their caller ID and go directly into our answering services business line for our company and the answering phrase sounds nothing like \"Such and Such Hospice, how may I help\" or \"Dr Smiths office\", and people will still be calling for medical reasons and not get slowed down or confused at all by the answer phrase. People are just so fuckijg self absorbed. Like the assholes who go \"yes.\" Or \"Ok.\"when I ask for a phone number or the spelling of a name. They just hear \"please hold and Ill get our nurse on the line\". Cant be fucking bothered to answer 2 simple no brainer questions first. \n\n",

Halfway into my vacation, I was made aware that the main company that hired us is leaving in a couple of months. Well, crap! Not what I wanted to hear while on vacation, but I wasn't sure if I would have a job when I got back. \n\n\n\nI figured I would wait until I got back to get all the details. Had an awesome time, enjoyed myself and my internet friend, drove to work this morning. Swiped in like I always do, everything at my desk was missing. Okay, weird. Walked around looking for my supervisor, but he's apparently in the new class for the mortgage company. Walked around aimlessly, looking for direction and more information. \n\n\n\nFinally get a manager to help me log in. Says my password is wrong. Weird. Then the senior ops manager comes to talk to me. \"Did you have a good vacation?\" \n\n\n\n\"Yep. Just wondering what is going on.\"\n\n\n\n\"Have a seat.\" Oh shit. Walked into HR, and they told me that because they have no record of me calling in (never mind the proof I had on my phone), I was terminated. I showed the senior ops manager and the HR rep my phone, showing the call dates and time stamps. \n\n\n\nHR rep tells senior ops it is up to her if she wants to let me go or not. \"I'm sorry we had to do this.\" \n\n\n\n\nBasically, despite my vacation being approved, and doing as I was told for protocol, I was termed. I'm absolutely livid, because I was actually doing something decent with my life (well, it felt that way anyway), and I could actually take care of myself. Senior Ops manager argued that I didn't call in, despite the proof on my phone, and I was terminated. This company was actually kinda decent for me, so I'm pretty upset about being let go, especially after going on vacation. The way they see it, it was job abandonment. So I'm kinda stuck here, unsure of where to go because god knows I don't want to go back to fast food. ",

        "text": "I work at a top-5 health insurance company so we see some pretty creative and crazy stuff. People call in from every walk of life, from professional ball players to people losing their homes. People who just want to talk about aliens for 40 minutes to people who call in because they really _really_ need to find a mental health professional because they don't know if they'll \"be alive at the end of next week\". All kinds of people.\n\nObviously one has to be \"avail\" whenever possible regardless of the call center one works at, but for the above-mentioned reasons they do monitor it a bit more closely than more traditional call center jobs, from what I've been told.\n\nI was off Tuesday, but I get into work early Wednesday and get to it. A quality coach ($QC) I'm really good friends with hits me ($KA) up on Lync not too long after.\n\n**$QC:** \"Have you been getting any prank calls? Or is anyone else mentioning any?\"\n\n**$KA:** \"Nope. Why?\"\n\n**$QC:** \"We've had like 25+ prank calls a day for the past few days. It's driving us nuts bc they sit there for like 10 minutes waiting for someone and then when we answer they hang up.\"\n\nWe get those every now and then. As a health insurance company, we make our share of enemies, though typically those callers want to yell, as I'm sure everyone here knows. We even very rarely get legit prank calls _a la_ Jolly Roger but just hanging up as soon as the call connects was unusual.\n\nAn hour or so later:\n\n**$QC:** \"So I started pulling reports and stuff bc its getting annoying like its just so excessive and I found the Bitch. I was like huh this has to be one person like there is noooo way this is a trend with multiple people.\" [sic]\n\n(She doesn't know much about the internet, but I didn't interrupt her.)\n\n**$QC:** \"I pulled her qfiniti and she had maybe ten inbound calls and the rest were outbound to us XD\"\n\n**$KA:** \"Wait, the person pranking us works _for us_?\"\n\n**$QC:** \"Like just making calls so [operations] wouldn't catch her not working.\"\n\nAs goofy as her (admittedly casual) typing is, this QC is a pimp who knows way more than she gets paid to know, and once she gets it into her head to solve a problem, she'll blow it up if she can't solve it. She had to do some legit digging to unearth this info.\n\nAfter consulting with her manager, she sent some notes to the appropriate people (the offending rep is in another state entirely) and sat back.\n\nThe next day, I come in, log in, and she hits me up:\n\n**$QC:** \"They single-skilled me to that line [she was calling] so we can get them back after back and she can't sit in outbound lol\"\n\nThroughout the day, this rep continued to try doing her thing, even though whenever she tried it it would bypass the hold (because the split is now empty) and go straight to the very person who'd discovered the deception. What a yutz. Our suspicion is that they wanted to have a manager of the rep's listen in as well, catch her in the act.\n\nLast update I got about it was that \"they scolded her about it\", which is an interesting response I guess, but it's whatever. If she'd been getting away with it for weeks or something, I'm pretty sure that would be an outright firing. Maybe the rep knows someone. We're not contracted with the company but instead work straight _for_ the company so they're a bit more loathe to fire people, it seems. Either way, she's going to have to be on her shit for a very long time to make up for this, I bet.\n\nNo one likes to be on phones. We know that. The goal is always to get off the phones, either by moving up at the current company or moving to a different job, but calling your _own_ company so you can sit there on hold picking your nails? At least have the sense to not call your own company, though I guess if the rep had any sense to begin with she wouldn't have tried doing it in the first place.\n\nWe know the rep's name and site. We're tempted to send her [this](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/4/4a/We_Know.png) from outside work without a return address. :P We won't, of course, but the mental image of her opening it is still fun to think about.\n\nPeople (and I include myself in this) always like to imagine they're so clever. The reality?: ain't nothin' new under sun.",

I sent it just the other day!\"\n\nMe: \"Okay sure, let me check the copy we have then. Maybe it was a mistake...\"\n\nThe two signatures were COMPLETELY different. They didn't even look like the same name.\n\nMe: \"I'm definitely seeing two different signatures. You have to sign with the same signature that's on file if you want to access the account.\"\n\nHer: \"Well I recently changed my signature so I can't do that, can I?\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, if you want to update the signature we have on file then we can do that too. I can send you a Change of Details form and a fresh Withdrawal Application. Just complete both and send them through at the same time and we'll update your signature while we process the withdrawal for you.\"\n\nHer: \"So I just need to fill out this form to change my signature?\"\n\nMe: \"You'll also need to attach some evidence in the form of identification. Driver's licence, passport, debit card, et cetera. The form lists all the relevant ID.\"\n\nHer: \"But my new signature isn't on ANY of that stuff!\"\n\nMe: \"Well, in that case, you'll need to update the identification with your new signature first, to prove that it's been changed.\"\n\nHer: \"But I don't WANT to! I shouldn't HAVE to do that!\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, then your other option is to just sign the form using the old signature.\"\n\nHer: \"I don't want to do THAT either! This is ridiculous!\"\n\nMe: \"Then... you can't make a withdrawal. The signatures need to match, one way or the other.\"\n\nHer: \"This is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS! This is ILLEGAL!\"\n\nMe: \"Wh-what? How is this illegal?\"\n\nHer: \"You bastards just want to KEEP my money so you can earn INTEREST on it, and now you won't let me withdraw any of it! That's illegal, and I'm going to SUE you!\"\n\nMe: \"You're... going to sue us for refusing a withdrawal with a totally different signature on it?\"\n\nHer: \"I can't BELIEVE how fucking SCUMMY you people are! Trying to STEAL an old lady's money!\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, just... try to see it from our perspective. What if this form HAD come from a random person? What if they just signed a random signature, and then we actually sent them YOUR money? There's a reason these protocols have been put in place.\"\n\nHer: \"No, you can't weasel your way out of THIS one! You'll be hearing from my lawyer!\"\n\nMe: \"Sure thing, ma'am. Thanks for calling.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, we never heard from her lawyer... but we DID receive a Change of Details form with all the relevant updated identification.",

        "text": "Ok, this one is going to be kinda long.  I was driving home from a shit day of dealing with shit people earlier tonight and for whatever reason I thought of this situation from many years ago.\n\nMy first job in call centers was as support for a department that collected on returned checks.  It was my first office job ever and I was intent on making my presence known there and show off the things I could do.  I immediately made an impact with my data entry speed and my organizational skills.  Only a few months into the job I was Employee of the Month for the entire company.  A fairly big deal at this particular company.\n\nI decided this was a good opportunity to start learning more and working my way up the ladder.  So I prodded and learned more and more and was promoted time and again until I was only one step away from the manager position.  The manager(AwesomeBoss) we had was promoted away from us and I put in for the job but was turned down for lack of managerial experience.  I was then tasked to BE the manager(without the title or pay) until they finally hired someone.  I was then tasked to train this person(Oops).  \n\nI was already getting a little jaded by all this but decided to continue plodding away waiting for my chance.  Oops was fired for reciting a tale of road rage where he said the word \"Mother Fucker\" so loud that even the HR manager heard it in her closed office.  He was fired within the hour.\n\nI was then made \"manager\" again but again turned down for the actual position.  I filled the job for several months before they hired someone, and I had to train her as well.  From day one I could tell she(HellBeast) was not going to work.  HellBeast had never worked check collections before, and had never worked with our systems before, but seemed to think she knew way more than I did about how the department worked.\n\nAt this time I had been working for this department for over 3 years and knew more about the area than anyone else in the company save our old manager.  This woman scoffed at that.  She constantly ignored our procedure, she constantly told me not to worry about important things like... counterfeit money orders, counterfeit checks, etc.  I explained to her multiple times that ignoring those things would be considered hiding debt and she'd get fired.  She ignored me.\n\nHellBeast hated me from day one and was constantly looking for a way to get rid of me.  She asked her boss to move me to a different department.  Gave me a shitty year end review even though she'd only been my manager for a month of that year.   I decided HellBeast needed to go.\n\nFast forward a month or so to when she hired two women(Crackpot and SweetPea) who had zero, I mean absolutely zero, experience with computers or phone systems.  Instead of following normal training procedure, she opted to instead have them do busy work while \"listening\" to the other agents.  As she deemed this the \"best training they could possibly receive\".  Strange that in 30 days they still had no idea how to do their job.  \n\nOn one of her off days I was told by SweetPea that she was quitting because she couldn't do the job.  She felt badgered and belittled by HellBeast.  Crackpot chimed in and said that she too felt this way. I talked to everyone else in the department and that's when they dropped the bomb on my Nagasaki.  Apparently HellBeast had gone to each one of them individually and asked them to report me for sexual harassment.  \n\nWhy you ask?  Because myself and another agent were friends outside of work and I always called her \"Girly\" so the others had asked for nicknames.  So I did. None were inappropriate for work, and none were at all sexual in nature.  Names like \"The Kid\" for the youngest one, \"Mama\" for the oldest one, things like this.  She saw it as somehow offensive and none of them agreed.  I was incensed.  Asked them all if they were willing to make their feelings known and they said yes.  \n\nSo I walked in HR manager's office and told her what was going on.  She said they'd look into it.  I told her that they were about to lose a third of their workforce today unless something happened.  She ignored me.  So I contacted the president of the company and told her what was going on.  Ten minutes later, we were in a meeting.  \n\nI walked in with a ream of evidence, including well over a million dollars worth of counterfeit items that she had hidden from our reports, and more.  We laid out our situation, told them that if she wasn't gone, then most of us were.  \n\nThe next day she came back to work, we all ignored her and treated her coldly.  About two hours or so into the day she gets called into a meeting.  Grabs up her legal pad, her pen, and her bitch glasses and tells me to \"monitor\" the group.\n\nShe never came back.\n\nTL;DR: HellBeast tangles with SirGuido and SirGuido ole's her ass right out the door.",

        "text": "FTP yada yada. TL;DR I'm tired and rambling, but some stories from my career as customer service at a cell phone company call center.\n\nSTORY ONE:\n\nBack in day, when I first started and did not know any better I was working at a vended call center for a major cell phone company (the center will from here on in be called \"The Fun Zone\" (/s)) I had a lady call in just completely livid that we were dropping her calls left and right, and she was trying to run a business and how could she run a meeting when her phone keeps dropping calls (her fault for have #1 that company especially at that terrible time 4-5 years ago and #2 \"running her business\" with a personal phone service account). She's demanding credits and free stuff as customers do.\n\nNow I'm sympathetic to her plight you know, I'm phone voicing it up with \"We're sorry to hear you've been experience these issues etc\" until I go into troubleshooting her phone. Check the number, and then the caller ID... of course she cannot follow instructions and called from the phone in question. So, I tell her I will look into her issue see what might have caused the issue and can give her some steps to try and resolve in the future. I don't see any tower issues reported... So I look at her usage that day so I could verify dropped calls (you know if they have to call back the same number multiple times within a short span). She was on a call from (I SHIT YOU NOT, the hours might be a bit incorrect this was years ago, BUT THIS IS NOT EXAGGERATION) 2AM to like Noon. ONE CALL no interruptions. Then to the same number from like 1PM (probably took a lunch)  to 6PM when she decided to call us and do the most. \n\nNow as I mentioned in the beginning I was still a bit wet behind the ears and opened my mouth like a big fat dummy. \"I'm sorry I can see that you were on the phone for X amount of time spaced between 2 calls and see absolutely zero evidence of a connection issue therefore I cannot offer you anything. she went from... 0... more like 70 to over 9,000. Just threatening hell fire from lawyers and what not so I did what anyone should do, let her know she's being put on hold and I'll see if a supervisor is available LOL (it was policy to escalate anyways if lawyers were brought up, so I wasn't being a self-escalating turd). \n\n\nSTORY TWO:\n\nThis is a short one, but I found it funny. Had a Middle Eastern immigrant call in one evening about phone service issues (seriously I worked for this phone company during like the worst possible time for them they were that terrible). Now this gentleman used his phone for business purposes which was, as he apparently was big proponent of reinforcing stereotypes, being a taxi cab driver. Now, I've known ex-cabbies and if there is a problem with dispatch their livelihood is going down the drain, full hearts out to this guy but I couldn't really help him (because of course he called in on the phone we needed to troubleshoot even though the IVR states we need them on a different phone) so he goes ballistic. Now the reason I pointed out the fact that he was Middle Eastern was because of his accent, which when he took his time and enunciated was thoroughly manageable if you paid attention. Not so much though when he was HELLA angry so for about half a minute I had him yelling on my phone I AM A TAXI CAB!!! DO YOU NOT SEE I AM A TAXI CAB!!!! Which while tragic that his job is getting screwed with, the fact that he was saying that actually brightened my day just imagining this guy literally being a taxi cab rather than being what he meant as a taxi cab driver. (One of you fellow Fun Zoners if you frequent this subreddit will probably know exactly who I am now, so HI!)\n\nSTORY THREE:\nNot really a big story here as I don't remember much, but it was probably the greatest insult that has personally gotten to me. Middle Eastern woman who just straight up called me a dirty human being. Like I've been called all sorts of things, but that was just. Even now I think that's one of the worst things someone has ever said about me. Considering it was some stupid issue too that I had no control over, that level of personal attack. Still pains me when I think about it.\n\nSTORY FOUR AND FIVE:\nI got tons of these and I don't want to go to bed. I'm going to preface these stories by stating I am a guy. However, my voice is not deep at all and coupled with my phone voice I got called ma'am A LOT (which is frustrating as hell considering I'm like a big 6' tall bearded guy, luckily my new job is actually not really a call center as I work from home and do mostly emails, but I still have to call some folks back :'()... \n\nI had a guy call in one night (I prefer working nights) and while getting into his account and everything he goes from customer to stranger danger by just straight up saying he'd like to buy my panties for $100 (lol ok dude they're not what you want) so I freeze up cause it's like 10 minutes before closing and I'm not expecting and can mutter out a quick \"Uh no thanks.\" Lame story, but this dude CALLS AGAIN and gets a girl (lucky him!) across from me, and I hear her JACKING THE PRICE UP ON HIM! Stating how she can make it a much better deal for the price XD finally the queue closed and she apologized and let him know on second thoughts they weren't for sale LOL.\n\nSo, whenever a lady is like \"YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE SEXUALLY HARASSED!!!!!\" I can just respond that they don't know me or my life. Especially with the next incident. \n\nSo, I'm workin' as one does and I get a normal call. He needs legit help and I'm helping him then I notice speaker phone is on (you can tell) and he hits me with a \"you wanna check my dick\"..... Uh excuse me \"Yo you wanna check (he might have been saying suck I dunno, but it sounded like check) my dick\" So I politely informed him that unfortunately, I'm not a medical professional trained in that sort of thing (which would be an odd reply if he was saying suck).... So, a bit cowed we continue the call (and he's still on speaker phone I heard chuckling when he asked me the dick question as he was goofin and gaffin with some buddies) and at the end I make it very clear that I'm a dude. His friends just busted up and you could hear them tease his ass and he sounded super embarrassed when he said good bye.\n\nSTORY SIX: \nTruckers are generally good people, but lonely. Once had a guy who we ended up talking for about an hour about steel beams and how jet fuel can't melt them (not exactly but if you imagine truck drivers calling into radio stations with conspiracy theories it was a lot of stuff). Super nice guy. Not really a story, but an anecdote of this one time.\n\nSTORY JAMAICA:\nNot a number as this story encompasses basically every single interaction with a Jamaican person at that job, corroborated with countless other reps through years of experience. Jamaicans only ever seemed to call about ONE thing. The fact that they had charges for texts or calls to Jamaica, even though they don't know no one in Jamaica. Despite the fact that they sound like friggin' Miss Cleo, it's always the same numbers and sometimes those numbers called them for conversation length phone calls. Nope, don't know anyone in Jamaica. It was ridiculous, like every time you hear the accent, you could with 99% accuracy know exactly what the call was about.\n\nSTORY EIGHT:\nGuy call in with a problem on his account. Turns out it's not his account it is his bosses account, but can give me all the valid information. Explains the problem his boss has with his account and states they want compensation for all the troubles and such. It's way more than an agent, or I could do at this point (as a Team Lead), or a supervisor could do. It's not even really something a manager at the site could do, especially for the problems and the service level our systems showed we were providing (as stated in contract we cannot guarantee 100% service quality etc). So, the agent connects the call over to me so I can handle it and as soon as we're in the account for me he shushes me. He states that if he doesn't get what he wants that his boss is willing to move his account and all his business else where (pfffft ok haven't heard that one before oh no we'll lose some lines). I state I understand, but from what we can see I can't meet his demands (calling his bluff). So he gives me an account number and says to search for it and gave me the pass for it. At this point I'm now out of my seat because this was the assistant of the CEO of a company with THOUSANDS+ of lines with us. I go and wrangle a supervisor to wrangle a manager (chain of command ya know) and while waiting look into this guys employee discount on the account. First time I ever had a customer #1 so completely call my bluff and #2 be on an account where the customer is the person listed in our discount system (like if you worked at BK it's gonna have that discount under like the CEO or CFO, in this case it was this customer). Blew my mind and he got exactly what he asked for lol.\n\nSTORY NINE: \nDiscounts got me thinking about another time a customer called in saying our poor service was costing him thousands and he was trying to run a business. Employer discount? McDonald's. Not like a higher level one that did exist but like a fry cook discount (plus he sounded super young). So, I guess our company was fighting drug sales?\n\nSTORY TEN:\nWorking late at night near the end of my time at that company. I was going to be changing departments and was just done. I forced myself to be demoted by skipping work for a week (they weren't letting the Team Leads sit themselves because of #1 how shit a position it was (tons more responsibility and zero raise) and #2 they couldn't find replacements from the others who had already quit etc... also to toot my own horn I was good at it and people liked me in that position)) and was more jaded than a mythological Chinese emperor. So, we had a rule you could do an accent if you could do it the entire call. I'm not sure how to describe what unholy accent I unleashed. To me it sounded like.... maybe retarded Carl Sagan would be the best way to describe it. Just that Sagan sound but I pushed it to eleven by elongated sounds. Just complete ridiculousness. Lame story but w/e it was a fun time and I almost killed my TL by making her laugh so hard. \n\n\n\nAnywho sorry for the Super long text. Read it, don't. I should have been in bed hours ago but am not. Ramble ramble.\n\n",

        "text": "Hey all~\n\nAs I posted before, I joined the world of being in a Call Center. However, my previous job did involve a lot of calling to people and was a mixture of Retail and Call Center, so it's not too new to me.\n\nI really love the power the comes with being part of the Scan Technician team as it means I almost only get inbound calls, so no anxiety about making a cold call.\n\nAs a quick description, I work for a company that provides PCI Compliance, which is used to prove that any business taking card payments are processing them safely and securely per guidelines set out by the Payment Card Industry. Normally it's simple, but some people are rather dull and choose a very complicated system for a basic Mom &amp; Pop shop. This is where I come in.\n\nMerchants will call in freaking out that the guidelines they need to follow are rather technical. It's their fault cause they choose to store card information or process over the Internet.\n\nMe: \"Thank you for cal-\n\nMerchant: \"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS, HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO COMPLETE THIS?\"\n\nMe: \"I can definitely assist you with the questionnaire, may I have the email address associated with the account?\"\n\nMerchant: -Usually gives a wrong email or I can't understand them- THIS IS NONSENSE (Note, despite being in The States, I work with U.K. merchants so they don't necessarily cuss).\n\nMe: -After working magic to locate the account- \"Taking a look at the account here it looks like you process using a card terminal connected to the Internet, is that correct?\n\nMerchant: \"I'M JUST A ONE PERSON SHOP I CONNECT THE ROUTER IN AND THAT'S IT\".\n\nMe: \"Unfortunately there's no discrimination with the questionnaire provided, whether or not you are a 1 person business or a major corporation, you would need to complete this.\"\n\nMerchant: \"DO IT FOR ME\"\n\nMe: \"It is called a Self-Assessment Questionnaire, so unfortunately I'm unable to complete it for you. Also, I would like to point out that while I can explain these details in full, I cannot answer them as I'm not at your place of business to verify how the network is set-up.\n\nMerchant: \"UGH\" -Hangs up-\n\nCall Review: 96/100. Did not say bye to merchant.\n\n\nAnother example would be refunds. I come from a previous company that absolutely refused to do refunds. It was a gym, so if people bought training and got into a medical emergency, we still refused a refund. They also only allowed cancellations in person, so if someone moved states then they still had to come in to cancel. That usually didn't end well. However, here we give refunds simply cause we don't waste more money with legal fees if escalated enough.\n\nMe: \"Thank you for calling ______, my name is RevoX4, may I please have the email address associated with your account?\"\n\nMerchant: -Provides email-. NOBODY GAVE YOU AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE ME.\n\nMe: \"Well, taking a look at the account here it seems that on this -gives exact date and time-, you accepted our Terms of Use that allows us to automatically renew the account. Just for extra precaution, it was done under the I.P. Address of -gives I.P.-. Was this done by yourself?\n\nMerchant: \"Er.. uh... yes-\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, well apologies if you didn't require the services. I will go ahead and issue you a full refund and close the account, is that okay?\"\n\nMerchant: \"...Yes\".\n\nMe: \"Alright, the amount has been refunded, any other questions or concerns for me?\"\n\nMerchant: \"... No\".\n\nMe: \"Thanks for calling in and hope you have a great day c: \"\n\nThere are still some bad calls, but I usually throw the policy at them or if bad enough, end the call since we have the right to do so.",

        "text": "I of course work in a call center or I wouldn't be posting in here, and judging by the people who I speak to would likely think that the person on the other side of the phone is subhuman. That being said after many years of working in call centers I have decided that humanity is doomed for one simple reason, People can't listen. \n\nI'm not even talking about paying attention to complicated procedures, or even super important things like the dollar amount on the contract being pre tax, or that an I can't garunte something. I am talking about simple repetitive things I say that somehow people just don't seem to catch. \n\nI work in the business department for my company, all I deal with is business accounts period end of story. Due to my hours and our wonderful phone system and the inability of people to know their information I still get multiple calls routed to me for residential customers every evening, and ninety percent of them go just like this. \n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for calling that company you openly hate **Business.** My name is me how can I help you today. \n\n&gt; AM (Another Moron): My internet is out and you need to fix it right now before I sue you. (Yes of course I have been threatened for lawsuits over such simple matters)\n\nWhat the customer doesn't know is that their account is already in front of me. Or I should say an account is already in front of me, and if it's a home account. If it's before five pm central there's about a twenty five percent chance that it's the one they are calling about, after five p.m central this jumps up to a ninety five percent chance.  \n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry to hear that and we can definitely take a look and see what's going on so we can get you back up and running. I just need a little information to get you back up and going. To start with can I get your name.\n\nNever acknowledge the crazy if you can avoid it. Other wise you get drawn in and nothing get's accomplished except for your blood pressure rising at the thought of how dumb most people are to think a lawyer would actually take that case. Also no my company does not allow us to disconnect calls over threats to sue, vulgarity, harassment, or threats unless it's actually credible and then we have a process for that. Yes at my call center we have to take the abuse, don't you just love it. \n\n&gt;AM: Another Moron, I am so tired of how long this takes I am on the phone with you guys way to much. My internet goes out all the time. \n\nNope by the call records here you haven't called us in six months. \n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry to hear that and as soon as we get your account up we can make sure we get the internet running and get you off the phone as quickly as possible. Could I get you're account number please?\n\nI don't know why I ask for it, even when it is a business account that comes up despite being on the bill, in their online account, and on every piece of account specific mail we send out the only people who commonly have it are the accountants. God I love them they always know exactly what the issue is and have all the needed information. Seriously if you are in a shopping center, in a building with lots of turn over, have multiple accounts in the same building, or that use the same address for some god awful reason have the account number and know which account it applies to. Apartment complexes are the worst about this, they will have an office account, a fitness room account, possibly a pool account, a gate account, then they have their on site persons account, they will know half the account numbers and never know which goes to which. \n\n&gt;Am I don't know it can you look it up some other way. \n\n&gt;Me Certainly do you know you're **Business** phone number?\n\n&gt;Am: It's 555-555-5555\n\nOf course it's to the home account that popped up, I've spent three minutes plus getting this information out of you and listening to you bitch when there isn't a thing I can do for you other than transfer you over to the correct department. Pay attention and we can cut that down to ten seconds to realize you are in the wrong spot and have you in the right one in under thirty. What makes it worse is that they inevitably call back to the wrong number messing up my FCR. Pay attention people and listen to what's being said or one day you are going to miss something even more important. \n\n\n",

I would be fine with this but they only pay us 10.00 an hour which i think is pretty crap for the stuff we're stuck dealing with. Each call is usually different and because its satellite internet the service is usually always terrible so tech support calls are always the worst.\n\nNow this being my first job in the call center industry im pretty naive on how well call center agents get paid but given all the company has us doing would 10 dollars an hour be fair?\n\nAlso side note never work for a satellite ISP you will lose your mind.",

Basically I answer the phones and make reservations for people wanting to go tandem skydiving.\n\nNow, our prices are what they are, and they're pretty damn reasonable for the kind of jumps we offer. If a customer is being nice, I'll go ahead and offer up a special- which I'm technically not allowed to mention unless they've seen it on our website and bring it up themselves. But my numbers are good and I get away with stuff like that because I have *never* had a negative review. People actually ask for me by name when they get to our skydiving location because I was so helpful they want to thank me in person.  \n\nAnyway. That was all backstory for why this is completely out of character for me, and yet so satisfying.

The higher you go, the more free fall time you have, and that's the best part of any skydive! Our most popular jump is [altitude and price] and you'll get more than a minute of free fall!\n\n&gt;MA: That's some bullshit. What about the hundred dollar one we saw on Google.\n\n&gt;NY: Yeah what about the hundred dollar one?\n\n&gt;Me: That's a great deal on a low-altitude jump from [altitude] and it will give you about 15 seconds of free fall time.\n\n&gt;MA: That sucks, only 15 seconds? I don't want that crap.\n\n&gt;Me: *cutting in before I have to hear NY repeat what his friend just said* We don't have just those two jumps! If you're  wanting to spend a little less than [highest altitude] we also have a great one for [$50 less] that will still give you an excellent...\n\nAt this point I trail off because NY is ignoring me completely and having a conversation with MA, in which I hear \"This is complete bullshit, what a gyp, do they think we're stupid (yes, I do.) etc. etc.\n\n&gt;NY: We don't want a shitty lower jump, we want a higher jump for [price point I had already named when he wasn't listening].\n\n&gt;Me: Well, I was just trying to tell you about our second highest jump which is right at the number you're wanting to spend. It's awesome! That jump will...\n\n&gt;NY, interrupting: We want the highest jump for that price.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, you can look around and see if you can find that somewhere else. **click**\n\nI immediately went to tell my supervisor that I lost my cool and hung up on a customer.

I've been a lurker/commenter here for awhile and wanted to share my story of being on the Chat Team last evening at my job.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI've been with my CC for almost 3 years now. Being a millennial (24) and quite honestly a huge nerd, sometimes alienates me from my many older co-workers who work the night shift with me (30-50+.) I am a Lead Service Specialist and take International Chats and Customer Escalations usually. My team is also the prank team, any time our regular Customer Service Reps determine a chat is a prank they can cold transfer to us. I got a customer who i'll call Harry because he seemed to be a fan of the potter puppet pals (YouTube this if you are a Harry Potter Fan and have not seen it. It's hilarious.) Here's how the transcript history looked. CSS is the rep who had the chat before me.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&lt;Your agent is reviewing your question and will be with you soon.&gt;\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Snape  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Snape  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Severus Snape  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCSS: Hello Harry how can I help you this evening?\n\n   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: DUMBLEDORE!  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Ron  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Ron  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Ron Weasley!!  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCSS: How can I help this evening?  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: I'm having trouble downloading Pokemon GO...  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCSS: I'll connect you with someone who can help you further.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Ok.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&lt;CSS disconnected&gt;  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&lt;Transferred to Tifa&gt;  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Are you still there?  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTifa: Hello Harry, I like Potter Puppet Pals and Pokemon GO just as much as you do! But I would like to ask you politely if you can please leave our chats open for our customers who need assistance?  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHarry: Ok.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&lt;Harry Disconnected&gt;  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nI can't really complain because after the chat ends a survey is sent to the customer and we can now finally review our surveys in real time about 5-10 minutes after they are completed. Harry gave me all 5 stars on our contact and commented that I helped him find the mysterious ticking noise and install Pokemon GO. God I wish I could share pictures of the customer survey but I am pretty sure it could get me fired if my job figured out I posted it here.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy job is usually a pain in the ass but pays wonderfully with amazing benefits. I pretty much get paid to argue with CSS that don't use their resources and get yelled at customers all day. This chat made my night. Despite it annoying my coworkers it made this nerd laugh and resulted in a 5 star Customer Satisfaction score that I pray to god gets pulled by QA for my July Monthly Review haha! Thanks for listening. I look forward to sharing more in the future!!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Edited due to typing on my phone and me sucking at formatting.",

        "text": "Hello TFCC! FTP so be kind please :)  \nI recently started working in a UK call centre for a company that provides phone, internet, and tv. I'm frontline support for business phone lines. Now, this is a fairly large company, and customers often come to the conclusion that we provide phone service for every single phone in the country. (I wish I was making this up!)  \nBecause of this, we quite often get calls from people with phone or net issues, that we don't provide service for. Cue, 9 times out of 10, the question of; \"Well can you tell me who does?\" Nope. Can't do it. Law says no. (Honestly, you get your service from someone else, and you don't know who it is??)  \nWe also sometimes get calls from people who can't get hold of a business, and want to know why. Again, these tend to be with different providers. \"No problem, I'll try another way to get in touch. Thanks!\" I like these people. They reduce my call time, and my stress just a little.  \n  \nCue Monday afternoon. Queues are long. Bad weather has been causing issues for nearly a month, and lots of people are losing their service because of it. Again, most people have been understanding and patient, with the obligatory \"This is ridiculous I've been waiting forever!\" arse. Then comes this woman.  \nCall comes through, number pops up, I can see on my screen she's been waiting for 20 minutes.  \n  \nme: *insert generic company greeting here* How can I help you?  \nAW: I've been trying to call a hotel for the last couple of days, to make a booking. It just keeps ringing out. Can you have a look and see if something's wrong with the line? (She's perfectly polite, which is nice)  \n*Now this is something we can do, we just can't give any specifics out if something is wrong. But my system can't find anything connected with that number.*\nMe: Ok, let me have a look and see what I can find out for you.  \n*I go into an older system, and plug in the number. I already suspected what came up on my screen*  \nMe: I'm sorry but it looks like they don't get their phone service from us. I can't check to see if the line is down.  \nAW: You're joking... *Voice has taken on that deathly calm and quiet tone that signals impending doom for me* This is ridiculous! *Excuse me?* What am I supposed to do now?? *She's shouting at this point.* I waited nearly an hour for you to tell me nothing?? *Seriously, it was 20 minutes. I know it isn't great, but it's nowhere near an hour!*  \nMe: I'm very sorry, but we don't provide their service.  \nAW: Well can you at least tell me who does, so I can speak to someone who CAN help me?  \nMe: I'm sorry, but all my system shows is that it's with another provider. It doesn't -  \nAW: Well that's just fantastic! *Still shouting* I can't believe I wasted half of my day waiting for this nonsense! *Half a day??* Thanks for wasting my time!! *click*  \n  \nI just sat there for a second. Took a deep breath and muttered \"Well fuck you too.\" And went back to the queue.  \nHonestly. Not our fault that the place doesn't do business with us. Believe it or not, she was the worst customer I had all day! Had a few sounding stressed, and more than a few sounding snippy, but not one other shouter. And it wasn't even her line that was down!  \nMost of my customers are actually pretty ok. As long as I at least try to help them, they are pretty grateful by the end of the call. Maybe one day I'll understand the odd ones?  \n  \nProbably not....",

Obviously not all CC's are the same but the vast majority of the below is true.\n\n**Management**; often completely out of touch with agents and how things work in the real world. Focused on numbers/metrics/reports rather than staff morale (which ironically would raise the aforementioned metrics in most cases). Will often \"mangle\" and bring in new policies which are completely unrealistic or completely out of touch with the agents/customers on the frontline.\n\nManagement is also grossly unfair in most cases...

You'll need to make that time back at the end of your shift! [completely ignoring the 60 mins after your shift you spent last night].\n\nCustomer being a complete weapons grade cunt towards you? Insulting you and your mother, the business, issuing death threats and giving you a hard time? That's unfortunate, we'll give the customer whatever they're demanding to keep them happy, they are after all, a special little princess entitled titties and we couldn't possibly afford to say no to them.\n\n**Micromanagement**; all CC's love to micromanage agents, it's pedantic and in most cases completely unnecessary to micromanage people to such extreme levels. Often you are treated like a child. You have a set time to deal with calls, wrap up/after call work, breaks, toilet. You're literally \"chained to the phone\" for the entirety of your shift, if you want to step away, you need to set the appropriate AUX code and you can bet it'll show up on some report the next day.\n\n**Customers**; 65% of the customers you deal with *will* be assholes, in one way or another - could just be in subtle ways or in your face. They'll either be one or more of the following (or a mix) abusive, condescending, demanding, entitled, act like babies, lie, deceive, think they know better, complain excessively, huff/puff, be rude, insulting, etc...\n\nUsually ~60% of customers problems are caused their own stupidity, entitlement, inability to read, or general lack of common sense/thought. But hell no, they'll never accept that - it's *your* fault dammit and you better fix it *right now*.\n\nAverage conversation with a customer; \"You *will* hold my hand throughout this incredibly simple process that a child could do. You answered the phone and thus are now my bitch. You obviously have other people waiting hence the long hold time to speak to you - but I'm entitled dammit. By the way, do you know how *unacceptable* that hold time was? Please continue to wait with me whilst I waste your time and increase hold times for people with legitimate issues so that they may further abuse you. I realise you're giving me a perfectly logical and reasonable solution to my issue - however I refuse to accept this, I demand your supervisor who will tell me exactly the same thing, but I do like to waste everyone time and then I can also complain about the length of the call - completely disregarding the fact you provided me with a reasonable solution to my issue 15 mins ago and if I'd stopped running my stupid mouth the issue could have been resolved by now\"\n\n",

Late fee had already been reversed yesterday when the payment was made and though the payment posted the late fee can still take between 72 hrs and 2 business cycles. Entitled customer (Cm) calls to see why they don't see the late fee credit, also the account can pull and verify if the caller is calling from their billing phone, which is what happened here\n\nMe: thanks for calling credit services in [state] my name is Ancalagon1421, may I have your name please?\n\nCm: Entitled Customer\n\nMe: thank you for taking the time out of your day to call us, we really appreciate it, how is your day going\n\nCm: THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS CALL.\n\nMe...okay [voice goes cold] how can I help you?\n\nCm: do you have my account pulled up? \n\nMe: yes how can I help you?\n\nCm: normally I need to give my information so ask your questions.\n\nMe: I see your calling on your home pho....\n\nCm: I KNOW WHAT PHONE I AM CALLING FROM WHAT DO I NEED TO ANSWER TO PULL UP THE ACCOUNT!?\n\nMe [as calmly as I can]: because your calling from your home phone our automated system verified you. How can I help you?\n\nCm: fine I was talking to an agent yesterday who said my balance is only going to be x10.xx when the payment posts, why is it higher. The late fee should have posted too.\n\nMe [checks notes]: your late fee was reversed yesterday and you will see a credit within two billing cycles, when the late fee posts your balance will be x10.xx\n\nCm: no, say \"Mrs. Customer your late fee will credit with your payment and your new account balance will be x10.xx.\" Try again.\n\nMe [stunned, then after a pause in a very flat cold tone] Mrs Customer (repeat what I already told her) \n\nCm: I know what my balance is! How this works is the late fee credits with the payment.\n\nThis went back and forth till I finally interrupted and escalated the call to management, well technically our Client Advocacy Unit in the Supervisory Department. Soon as the CAU rep said his title she stated \"you are not titled a manager there for your are not a manager and I don't need you. Goodby!\" And hung up. I was shaky after that call so took a longer than normal break. Thank god I only have had two if this type of customer in the past 6 months!\n\nEDIT: clarity",

        "text": "Hello! Back for round two!\n\nI worked at a local gas utility company for a while, manning the front lines with my trusty keyboard and headset. I handle billing, account, and service order scheduling. Basically, general support staff for customers. Every now and again, we get quite the doozy of a call. These are my favorite calls! The customer calls in with a weird report, and I get to investigate what could be causing it! TL;DR at the end.\n\nAnyways, I get this guy calling in one day and he is absolutely furious because he got a delinquent notice regarding his account balance. After getting his account information and verifying his identity, gathering some information about the situation, and placing him on hold, i dig into the account to see just wtf happened.\n\nLooking into his customer records, i notice right off the bat that he has two accounts, one inactive, and one active. He told me that he moved from Address A to address B. A was the inactive one, and B was the one he moved to, the one that got the delinquent notice.\n\nI start investigating the payment ledger and notes for his active account. I see that two months prior, he had a balance of around 80.00, and he promptly paid that off.\n\nA few days later, for some reason, he called in and the rep transferred around 60.00 of that payment to the (now) inactive account, which left a 60$ hole in the ledger that he owed us. Looking into the history of the inactive account, the cause of this was he received a delinquent letter for THAT account, because when it closed, he paid the balance, but then didn't pay the final bill.\n\nSo, for some reason, instead of paying that outstanding balance, he asked the rep to transfer his payment from the bill that he owed. Now, front line reps don't execute the ledger orders like that, so it had to go to the billing department. That's when all hell broke loose.\n\nSo, the customers account currently looked like so: 80.00 balance; 80.00CR payment; 0.00 forward balance; 50.00 gas usage; total balance 50.00. The billing department dropped the ball by sending out the new bill showing they only needed to pay the 50.00, instead of the 130.00, and then they transferred the payment shortly after the bill was finalized.\n\nWhen the customer only paid 50.00, leaving an 80.00 balance for his next month, that procced the delinquent notice to go out.\n\nNow, i went back to the customer with all of this information in hand. Simple, all that happened was he paid us his bill, it got transferred to cover a different payment, and now he has to pay the difference.\n\nOh but man, If only it would ever go like that. But no, I was destined to argue with a grown ass man the basics of fucking arithmetic for at least 30 minutes, all the while hurling nonsense about us trying to steal his money and double charging him, and \"that doesn't sound right\", to my logic and math.\n\n==========\n\nTL;DR: Customer with two accounts pays one account, then transfers payment to second account; confused as to why he still owes money on first account.\n\n(Sorry if this format sucks, this was more of an explanation story rather than a dialogue story)",

        "text": "After 3 years of working for this small company as a CSR I finally got a little promotion to \"Tier 2\". This ended up coming with new hours, 1:30pm-10:00pm. From 8-10 it's just one other CSR. I'm considered the supervisor on duty from 6-10. \n\nI was talking to a coworker, call her Mary, who does QA's about changing my hours a little earlier because call volume is dead between 8-10 and they really don't need 2 people. My coworker, we'll call him John, doesn't take calls/goes on \"not ready status\" at 9:30 because he's paranoid about being stuck on a call after 10. I casually brought this up, not in a \"OMG, John doesn't take calls after 9:30.\" But more of a \"It's so dead, we don't take calls.\" She reacted like \"Oh, that's not cool at all\" and then brought it up to my manager. I was not expecting this.\n\nAt that point I felt bad because I knew John might get written up or something. Today I had a meeting with my supervisor, call him Mark. He said that John was on not ready for 3hrs out of his 5hr shift, and that's not acceptable. My manager sent an email out saying we're expected to be on ready call up until 9:55. \n\nMark said that in my position, I should only be taking calls if 1) it comes through the tier 2 queue or 2) John is on another call. \n\nHe said that I need to make sure John is on ready call during those hours, and to send daily reports. In our meeting it was mentioned they were going to promote someone to supervisor soon and I would be a great candidate. So obviously I want to prove I can do this shit. \n\nI spoke with John and apologized, telling him I didn't mean for this to turn into such a big thing. I also had to remind him twice to be on ready call. He was visibly pissed off at me, but kept his cool. He basically said \"I don't care what the policy is, I'm not taking calls after 9:30. They can write me up, I'm going to quit anyways.\"\n\nHow do you deal with this? I had conflict and confrontation. And am I an asshole for bringing it up? I honestly didn't mean to throw him under the bus. And no he didn't get written up. ",

My brother has a bad habit of doing this, though I'm sure it's deliberate because he knows how much it irritates me.\n\nI digress. I work for a phone, internet and cable provider. Right now, we're in our bury season which basically means we have millions of guys going around coordinating with cities and utility companies to bury cable lines. Part of this process involves utility companies coming out and marking/flagging their underground lines so our bury teams know where they are and don't damage them. Most people know this and understand its necessity.\n\nAnd then there's this asshole...\n\nWe'll refer to them as DC for dumb...yeah you got it.\n\n*********\n\nMe: Thank you for calling [job] my name is GlissandosNTrills, how may I assist you today?\n\nDC: Yeah I'd like to know why I've got these orange flags on my property.\n\nMe: Sure. I'd be more than happy to assist you with that. I just need to verify your account information first, if that's ok?\n\nDC: (Sighs) Go ahead.\n\n(I verify their account)\n\nMe: Ok, so currently with the warmer months now here we've opened up what is known as our bury drop season wherein we respond to numerous orders for our underground lines that need to be buried and/or replaced.\n\nDC: Well when are they going to replace mine because we've been having problems and (I don't really remember this. Tuned most of the whining out.)...???!!\n\nMe: Well, at this time, I don't see that a specific date has been scheduled at this time. But those orange flags are from util-\n\nDC: But WHEN are they coming to bury it??\n\nMe: I don't see that anything has been scheduled at this time. However,  if those orange flags are there, that means the local- [utility companies have located their lines and are currently coordinating with our bury teams to have that line buried] &lt;&lt;&lt;brackets didn't get said because of being interrupted.\n\nDC: YOU'RE not listening. I need to know WHEN they're coming out here to bury my line.\n\nMe: (I pause to collect myself) Again, I do not see that anything has been scheduled at this time. The placement of the orange flags, however, means the utility companies- [have done their part and we are likely at the phase of setting up an appointment to replace and/or rebury your line]\n\nDC: Can I speak to your supervisor??\n\nMe: At this time I don't have a supervisor available. However, if you would allow me to finish explaining this process and the next step-[a supervisor contact wouldn't be necessary as they work with the same tools we do and have the same information available regarding this pending bury]&lt;&lt;&lt;cut off again\n\nDC: Well is there ANYONE else I can talk to? BECAUSE (literally don't remember this rant, I started checking my emails and doing other shit)\n\nMe: (Dead silent...for like 30 seconds)\n\nDC: HELLO??? (to their spouse) Did this bitch hang up on me???\n\nMe: No, I'm still here. I was just waiting for you to finish so that I can explain this process. \n\nDC: Fine! Go on!\n\nMe: Okay, so as stated previously, there is no schedule set for the bury at this time. The flags that were placed-\n\nDC: I'M REMOVING YOUR FLAGS UNTIL YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT HERE TO FIX THIS LINE!\n\nMe: DC, those flags do not belong to us they were placed by the utility companies to mark their lines so that- [our bury team will know where they are and avoid damaging any of them such as a gas line. If you remove them, our bury team will not be able to do the job because they won't know where those utility lines are. So they'll have to contact the utility companies again to remark their lines, and your slot will be pushed back impeding this process exponentially. This is a very busy time of year for bury drops and you will be bumped down further if they have to start the process over.]\n\nDC: I need to cut my lawn so I'm pulling up your flags and you guys can put them back yourselves. WHEN ARE YOU COMING OUT HERE?? It's always something with you people! And I think it's RIDICULOUS that you don't have a supervisor available when I as a PAYING customer have (they lost me again.  I did latch on to a few curse words and a muffled uttering of the c-word, but whatever).\n\nMe: (Reading emails, chatting coworkers, etc...purely silent )\n\nDC: ARE YOU THERE??\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nDC: (Starts ranting and raving and cussing me out again for another 3-5 minutes) HELLO???\n\nMe: Yes?\n\nDC: WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS??\n\nMe: DC, I've made several attempts to answer your questions and each time you have interrupted me and subsequently impeded any ability to address your concerns. I understand your inquiry regarding when someone will be out to bury your line. There is no bury drop scheduled on your account at this time. Is there anything else that I can help you with?\n\nDC: What is your name???\n\nMe: GlissandosNTrills \n\nDC: And where are you located?\n\nMe: [15 minutes from your house] (I told them my location and indeed I am not far)\n\nDC: *Crickets*\n\nMe: Are you still there?\n\nDC: (clearly frantic) Hello?? I can't hear you! I think my phone's messed up? \n\nMe: Can you hear me n-\n\nDC: HELLO?? *Disconnects call*\n\nMe: (Calls them back) Yes, hello, this is GlissandosNTrills with [job] I think we lost our-\n\nDC: (screaming) HELLO??? HELLO? *Click*\n\nMe: ...\n\nWorst thing about this, their shit was working fine, and they called back to upgrade their package for more channels 2 hours later according to someone else who got them in my center, and requested a discount because the organge flags are preventing them from cutting their lawn. \nThey then hung up on them when my coworker told them that wasn't possible. They called back again, got someone overseas, who ended up escalating them to a supervisor and got them $10 off their bill every month.\n\nShit like this pisses me off.",

I have over 10 years in the call center industry for Education, Technology, Finance, Sales from everything from Global WFM, Training, Organizational development, Software development, Site ramps, and a lot of stuff understanding how people interact in the workplace. My latest gig was running a 400 seat call center where I was allowed a lot of autonomy to experiment with organizational structure, the most extreme of which was a team that controlled all aspects of their lives including choosing or removing their leaders, controlling compensation and incentives. I have a promotion running innovation for 40 centers, and my drive was what it was on the phones. How do I make the job suck less? So I have a few comments, feel free to ask questions or lob insults of your own.\n There is something I have noticed I would say over the last 3 years. First industry absenteeism going up domestically significantly and the propensity for call center executives to blame it on millennials in the work place. That this is the new normal.  I do not think this is true, and if it is it is because organizationally we are missing the mark somewhere. What do you think?\n\n\nWhat levers in your organization or culture would you change other than or on top of compensation that would have a fundamental impact on you being happy with your Job?\n\n\nHow big of a factor does organizational transparency play a part in your Job satisfaction?\n\n\nWorking on the phones is fundamentally isolating, in what way would you like to see things change to make the job feel less isolating? \n\n\nLove to hear what you think, is there a question I should be asking?\n",

        "text": "So I saw that the other day someone posted asking for stories.  Here is one of my best:\n\nMy first call center job was doing collections for a clothing company that we will call PantsNSuch.  We did collections on returned checks. Customers would pay us for the returned check and everything was good.  If they wanted to return the items instead they had to get a voucher from the store and send that to us.  This lady didn't understand how checks worked.\n\nI called her up let her know her check returned and that she owed us for it.  She responded with \"Oh I knew that was going to happen so I took everything back.\" \n\nSo I said \"Oh ok, simple enough just send us the voucher showing you returned it and we'll update the account.\"\n\nHer: \"What do you mean?  What voucher?  I just returned the items and got my money back.\" \n\nME: \"Wait, what?  They gave you money back? They shouldn't have done that.\"\n\nHer: \"Why not, its my money!\"\n\nSo I then explain to her that it's not.  \"You see there's this little thing called a check and when you write that check you are basically handing the store a promise that your bank has that money to cover it.  In your case, they didn't.  So, you never actually PAID for those items.  We never received any money.  When you returned them, the money you were given wasn't yours.\"\n\nHer: \"Yes it was.\"\n\nSo I decide to do a little creative problem solving. \"Ok, let me explain this differently.  Let's say that you are having a yard sale and selling off some of your stuff.  I come by and see that you have a tv for sale that I really want but I don't have any money on me.  So I go to you and write out on a piece of paper to have my bank pay you the $100 for the tv when you go there. But then the next day I come back with the tv and tell you I changed my mind and want my $100 back.\"\n\nHer: \"Well, no because you never paid me.\"\n\nME: \"Exactly.\"\n\nHer: \"Well this isn't the same thing at all.  I paid with a check.\"\n\nMe: \"You do realize that a check isn't the same thing as actual money right?  Its only good if you have the money to back it up, and in this case you didn't.  So you just need to take the money they gave you at the PantsNSuch store back in there and pay off the account and you'll be fine.\"\n\nHer: \"Hell no!  Why would I pay for something twice?\"\n\nThis continued in the same vein once a week for a solid 60 days.  She never did understand and always insisted that the money she got back was rightfully hers.  I even at one point explained that she would be blocked in the check writing system we use if she didn't pay it.  2 days after we charged her off she called in raising 12 kinds of hell because she couldn't buy her groceries.  When I told her why, she accused me of trying to steal from her and she was going to sue us, etc, etc.  I have a feeling that almost 15 years later she still doesn't understand how checks work.",

        "text": "I've been working in this call center for over four years, and I'm still pretty much doing the same stuff I was doing when I started plus one or two other things. I got this job a year after graduating college (If you are ever considering a degree in the humanities, please reconsider! I paid dearly for my love of knowledge for its own sake.) \n\nI wish I could say I'm moving up to a better, more fulfilling career, but I'm going back to school to get an IT certificate. I've always been interested in computers, and started building PCs and learning about managing servers after getting into Minecraft. I got an A+ back in February (don’t bother telling me it’s useless, I’ve heard it already a million times. It’s served a foundation for further study for someone who hasn’t been a 1337 h4&gt;&lt;0r since I was five, which is exactly what it advertises itself to be.) Anyway, that wasn’t getting me an out fast enough, so I decided to sacrifice some of my savings and get out now to go back to school. \n\nI went from not even looking forward to the weekends anymore because I knew that Monday morning was 56 hours away to being almost as excited as I was when I was a kid in the last few weeks leading up to the end of the school year, so at least I know that I needed to get out. \n",

        "text": "Context: part of my job is doing answering service for a lot of different medical offices. \n\nSo, the other day I got a phone call just after five o'clock when all the offices are closing and their phone lines start coming to us. My caller had apparently been on the line with an someone to schedule an appointment and then her phone call dropped just as it hit closing time. So when she called back, she got me instead of the office. The lines are set to forward to us automatically, so this does happen from time to time, unfortunately. Usually we have to tell people to just try back in the morning, or we can take a message, but we can't actually schedule appointments. \n\nSo, this woman was understandably frustrated. She stayed polite with me, though, which I appreciated. She explained that her doctor had told her to get this appointment scheduled with a specialist as soon as possible. I could tell that she was a little freaked out and anxious, so I told her that I would try to get her through to the inside line and try to catch someone before they all left. I had to try a couple of different numbers, but I did end up getting her connected with someone who could help her. \n\nApparently this woman was so thankful that she actually tracked down my boss's phone number and called to praise me for going \"above and beyond.\" So when I came in the next day my boss pulled me into her office to tell me. That part was really sweet. I didn't actually do anything extraordinary for this woman, but it is nice to be appreciated occasionally. \n\nBut the reason that I am posting this and hoping for feedback is that it didn't stop with just calling to talk to my boss. This woman also said that she wanted to bring me a gift. And my boss actually told her where our office is. A few days later, I came in to find a card with my name on it and a wrapped present, which turned out to be a scarf. On the one hand, I feel like this is really nice and I am glad to know that I am doing a good job. On the other hand, I feel like we've crossed a line with her bringing me a present. I am really glad that I wasn't there when she stopped by because I would have felt really awkward and uncomfortable. I wish my boss had told her that we can't accept gifts or something. The woman put her email address in the card she left for me, but I have not written to her. Maybe I should thank her for the scarf, but I just want to be done with the whole thing. What do you guys think? Am I right to think this is weird? \n\nTLDR: A woman tracked me down at work and gave me a gift to thank me for basically just doing my job.",

        "text": "So some of these I am siding with customers and will be more tame in a sense than my previous post but just curious, we all have to have some. Again, I worked auto loan collections and I had some company policies related to the job that I hated.\n\n\n* Having to always ask an employee who transfers into you, if they didn't tell you already asking them if the customer has been fully authenticated and verified. Do we not trust our fellow workers? If people are not doing so at any point during the call they should be given further training.\n\n\n* So many scripts to read. I had to ask what seemed like five questions and many scripts to process a payment.\n\n\n* Customer service just being there to transfer calls to you...I want to know what they did other than transfer calls because it seemed like even if the account was ONE day past due, I had to do their job because they couldn't touch the account.\n\n\n* SCRA section can only work military accounts. I'm all for SCRA and think it is a great thing but I think the company implementation of it sucks. I was in the USAF from 2007 to 2015 and while I didn't work shift work or anything, I know people didn't have it as good as me and have to work odd hours and do this and do that and may be half way across the world but why in the hell can't I help a service member who just wants to make a payment? It was against company policy for me to help them, but when you transfer over to the SCRA line, they tell you that you can work the account more often than not and the hours (8-5pm EST) are not reflective of all military members. Moreover they poped up ny calls both inbound and outbound so really? There was something else but I forgot. Now that I think about it, I don't think I ever used SCRA while I was in the military, the three cars I had (one lemon and two new ones) I got low interest rates beforehand and had enough in savings to pay them off anyway.\n\n\n* Special collections/redemption/repo etc only being open certain hours that are not the same as the hours regular collections work. Here I feel bad for the customers. Why not be open the same hours as everyone else in collections or customer service is open? Repo men don't stop and aren't limited to the hours our repo department is working....What if you were on the west coast? While our repo team was open until 9pm (EST) that is 6pm their time, so that really is unfair for those on the west coast, IMO.\n\n\n* Having to do a deposit in your checking account when setting up payments online to make sure it works to setup payments online. You don't have to when doing a payment over the phone so why does online have to be silly. In fact, I have a credit card with the bank I work for and I didn't have to do this for a savings account, dunno about checking and even then didn't have to do this with my other credit cards. News flash, it isn't 2005 anymore. I had to do this when adding a checking account to Paypal 11 years ago, and didn't have to when I added another banking account to Paypal since. Hell, I've had multiple bills, car payments, mortgage that allows me to say I am keeping up with 1/20th of a Kardashian and I never had to do this there. So I don't see the point.\n\n\nThere was more but I forgot.",

        "text": "I was recently seasonally furloughed working for a call center for a local utility company specializing in natural gas. This call happened about six months ago. It is my job to handle account and billing inbound/outbound calls. Its about 11:30 am or so, and I'm about to go on lunch at noon, and I get a ring in my ear. The call goes approximately like so:\n\n*\n\nMe: Thank you for calli-\n\nIrate Lady:  WHAT THE FUCK, SEND HIM BACK RIGHT THE FUCK NOW, I WANT MY SERVICE TURNED BACK ON!!!\n\nMe: [assuming shes late on her bill or something] ...-I'm sorry to hear that your service was disconnected! My name is [My Name] I am with [company], I'd be happy to help you out here, [I ask for account info]\n\nIL: [gives account info] Your damn technician, the dickless son of a bitch just turned my fucking gas off, send him back right this damn minute!! He didn't even knock on my door or anything, and when I went out to yell at him to come back, he was already halfway down the street! Hes still probably less than a few blocks away still!\n\nMe: [I notice the technician is a contractor tech only rated to disconnect service. Disconnections are a common-enough issue where we have dedicated employees who just go and disconnect service on accounts that need it] Ma'am, I'm going to do what I can to help out here, but I need to mention that we will not be able to send that particular technician back to reconnect your service, as he is not rated to reconnect service, and he is on his way to the next service call. However, I'd be hap-\n\nIL: No, dammit! You send THAT ASSHOLE BACK HERE SO I CAN RIP HIM A NEW ONE!!\n\n*\n\nI just reiterate that we cannot send that particular technician back, offered to escalate the call if she wanted to speak with someone higher, etc. I also explained the reconnection process, which has a deposit requirement, a reconnection fee, a requirement for them to pay at least half of their total balance, and we weren't even going to be able to come out the same day to reconnect service without paying a 100$ fee (its super expensive to call a same-day technician), so she had some choice words about that.\n\nAnyways, I'm about to wrap up the reconnection process when I tell her that we need to process the payment before we can schedule a service order for reconnection. This brings her back to crazy-town (though she never really left) and she starts ranting and raving and demanding that I send the previous technician back so she can have words with him.\n\n*\n\nMe: Ma'am, I understand your frustration, but as I already explained, that technician is now on another service order at this time, not only can we not send him back to your location because hes already busy, but that would not be a productive use of time. I would be happy to escalate a complaint up to their immediate supervisor for review, and they would be happy to call you b-\n\nIL: No, no sir-ee, you need to send him back here right now. You send him back here right now, so I can put this barrel up to his head and pull the fucking trigger.\n\nMe: ... [awkward silence for a few seconds as I mentally sigh, contemplating what to do next]\n\nMe: ...Okay, Ma'am, I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this service order for you on our end. Can you tell me what method of pa-\n\nIL: Give me your supervisor.\n\nMe: Ma'am? Is there something wrong?\n\nIL: I. Want. To. Speak. To. Your. Manager.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I'd be happy to escalate your call to my supervisor, but-\n\nIL: Is he a faggot?\n\nMe: [surprised] Excuse me? \n\nIL: Are you always this slow? I ASKED IF HES A FUCKING FAGGOT, whats so hard to understand about that?!\n\nMe: [At this point, as a gay person myself, I'm immediately pissed off] Ma'am, that is incredibly inappropriate, not to mention I have no idea what my supervisors sexuality is because it has no bearing on this conversation. If you would like to speak with them, i'd be happy to get them on the line.\n\nIL: I refuse to speak to faggots.\n\nMe: [I'm done] Fine, whatever I need to do to make you happy, Ma'am. However, I'm going to have to terminate this call, as you refuse to speak with me. So, before I go, I just want to go over your order, real quick here. We are coming out to [address] at some point between [timeframe] to reconnect your service. You will be providing a check or cash for the technician when he gets there in the amount of [amount]. Ma'am, thank you for calling [company], if you need anything else, or if you would like to change the details of your service order, please call us back, we'll be happy to assist you. [click]\n\n*\n\nAfter hanging up the call on the customer, I quietly walked over to my supervisor and hand him the account number, and tell him to listen to the call because there was a threat against an employee. \n\nAfter I went to lunch, I pulled up the account again, the reconnection order I had taken was cancelled, and there was an incident report stating that any and all onsite technicians for their account are now required to have supervisor and law enforcement escort.

        "text": "So I worked Auto Collections for a large bank for almost six months...and I learned a lot and I tried not to be a dick or aggressive when dealing with customers even though I am thinking the opposite in my head. I dunno, I just can't do it. You don't and can't pay me enough to judge someone like some of my coworkers who straight up were yelling at customers and some of that aggression carried into their life. So glad to be out of here! Here's some common scenarios. Please pardon the formatting.\n\n\n\n**I have the account setup for auto payments!**\n\n\n* Cool, technology makes mistakes. Sidebar: I have many of my personal accounts on auto payments but I keep an eye on them and make sure they are actually working because I know and realize technology can fuck up, so I \ntrack. Not religiously each account but I track my checking account at least once a day and my credit cards too. And we have so many auto bill pay options and I can't help if you don't even know how you set it up or what  option you are using.\n\n\n\n**I'm on the account and it's my car....**\n\n\n* Sorry, you are not on the account as a signer or cosigner so you are not liable and have no obligation to make a payment and it's not affecting YOUR credit. I'll take your money sure but it's not your car technically even if you are a third party. Straw purchases are a bitch. And when you say you cosigned for someone...that person you cosigned for, well they aren't on the account and YOU are the primary signer and you got hosed.\n\n\n\n**Used luxury car broke down after you bought it at a sketchy dealership?** \n\n\n* It's between you and the dealer, possibly a mechanic. You got a lemon at that shady mom and pop car dealer? It's a civil matter if it is between you and the dealership. It was your decision to finance the car with our bank and ultimately YOUR decision to buy the damn thing. No we won't take the car back unless you do a voluntary surrender and possibly fuck your credit up even more. Don't tell me you have a family or need this for your family when you bought something that is not really practical due to repair costs - a used luxury car. Nothing is wrong with a Honda or Chevrolet esp. if you can't afford luxury. And if you ask me what I would do in this situation? First of all I wouldn't buy any used luxury car, and I would reevaluate my life decisions if I was \npaying 10% interest for ANY car. I've had this happen twice with luxury cars.\n\n\n\n**My car is in the shop so the payment is late and I need an extension.**\n\n\n* And if it's a brand new car....is the damn thing under warranty? First thing I ask because a warranty is a wonderful thing should cover most all repairs. And if not, guess what! You are still liable for payments while it  is in the shop. I had a piece of shit used car years ago that the repairs were almost as much if not more than the monthly payment and just because it was in the shop, I knew I still had to make them. If you have a leased car that is used for personal use (not business) and it being in the shop affected your ability to make the payments I want to know because you can't lease a used car and you have a warranty. If you need an extension because you are catching up after it got fixed, fine but don't call me when the car just got to the shop. If anything I see this MORE with NEW cars than I do used. I had a guy call and tell us that the dealer told him to give us a call to  give him a six month extension since his car was going to be in the shop for that long for a recall (that big air bag recall) like hell we are going to give you a six month extension...\n\n\n\n**I want to refinance.**\n\n\n* Really? 9 times out of 10 the payments are always late, possibly 30+ days a few times, account has been out for repo a few times and almost always this happens with a car we won't refinance as it is more than five model years old and over our mileage limits (85,000) and I don't think these late payments/repo history helps. There is a reason why your interest rate is what it is...\n\n\n\n**I want to mail out a payment, I don't trust electronic payments!**\n\n\n* Well, it's pretty easy to dispute compared to a check that may get lost in the mail. Oh and postage and stamps can add up if you pay all your bills this way. Is it that fucking hard to read or give a routing/acct number from a  check or a debit card? It doesn't cost the customer anything, and a lot less effort is required. Ironically enough one time I had a guy much younger than me, and surely on his phone 24/7 and even mentioned the bank app on  his phone and was like I'd rather mail a payment, so why not make a payment that way via the app...\n\n\n\n**I don't get a statement so I'm not liable to make this payment or know when my bill is!**\n\n\n* Well, your payment date doesn't change, and yes you are liable...read the contract. And if you are asking this, \nwhat the hell do you need a brand new one ton truck that you are paying $900 a month for? Yes the bank sucks \nwith onboarding/sending mail and I will give you that but you are still liable and if you don't get a bill, it's your \ncredit and your account at the end of the day. I just bought a house and didn't get a water bill and didn't want to \nbe late, so I called my water company and bam got it sorted in fifteen minutes and sure enough I was still able to \npay my bill in a timely matter and on time.\n\n\n\n**I just made a payment and you have to cancel my repo.**\n\n\n* Sorry the payment you made wasn't even enough for one monthly payment and you are past due for multiple \npayments. With this logic you could make a 5 cent payment for the car and it wouldn't get repo'ed. I had someone who was way behind mail a payment (forgot if I mentioned it already) and they knew it was out for repo and mailed a check. Really? Do you think we would get it in time. When it is out for repo, it may get picked up THAT day.\n\n\n\n**I can pay extra...?**\n\n\n* Yup. I don't know why people fail to think of this or think it is going to hurt them. Side note: I paid my last car \noff two-three years early because I paid extra on it. Why don't people understand this? Yes it was with a different \nbank than for who I work for but nothing is stopping you from our end. And no we don't penalize you for doing \nso.\n\n\n\n**I'm having issues online! I can't find the thing; I forgot my password/username!**\n\n\n* Did you actually try to figure it out, or use the forgot username/password thing? I can't manually do everything for you. Yes we have online support but you gotta try and figure it out too buddy.\n\n\n\n**I need your first and last name - well the account is under xyz**\n\n\n* No I need YOUR name. How do I know you aren't authorized on the account?\n\n\n\n**Please take the car! I'm going to kill myself because it is too hard to make a payment! I want the automated\nsystem.**\n\n\n* Well if you paid your fucking bill on time you wouldn't be transferred to a live person so easily. I had this guy \nand it was a gesture as he later called back, someone else collected the payment. Got him a month later and he \nwas a bit more reasonable but still a mess.\n\n\n\n**You are not going to ruin my credit on this past due payment. I have worked so hard and have a perfect payment history!**\n\n\n* Perfect history my ass. I see multiple payments 30 or more days late and a 20% interest rate! Your car is 8-9 \nyears old too.\n\n\n\n**My (spouse/significant other etc.) pays the bills...**\n\n\n* Well maybe you should authorize them on the account if they aren't already, or even better yet maybe they \nshould be the signer on this loan instead of you.\n\n\n\n**I paid with my credit card last time...**\n\n\n* Sorry we don't accept credit cards - can't use credit to pay for credit, nor do we accept American Express or \nDiscover. If you aren't sure what payment method you used last time, doubtful you made the payment when you \ndid or made it at all.\n\n\n\n**I traded the car in, the dealership did this, and dealership did that!**\n\n\n* CALL THE DEALERSHIP. If they fucked up it is on them, not us. We are not fuck buddies with them; again \nthis could be a civil matter between you and them. If they failed to mail the payoff, yell at them not us.\n\n\n\n**I'm going through a divorce....**\n\n\n* Other than getting a lawyer I don't know where to begin as I get this where the ex-spouse is almost always the \nex-spouse from hell but lawyer up. If your spouse is crazy as hell, well let us know but we can't give advice \nother than the payments need to be made and listen to the judge/lawyers. Again, a civil matter.\n\n\n\n**I'm a long time customer...you can't hook me up with an extension or fee waive?**\n\n\n* If you really are a long time customer, why can't you pay your bills in a timely matter and your interest rate is so high? You probably are not new to the concept of a loan.\n\n\n\n**I got this letter in the mail.**\n\n\n* I get this a lot from Massachusetts. Fucking stupid ass state law. I sometimes get 3 calls about this a day. A \ncoworker had a guy call po'ed about this saying he was going to sue. Went on to say he was a lawyer and when \nwe let him know where we were located he said he couldn't find anything online. A quick Google search shows \nwe exist where we tell you where we are located and the same with the letter too.\n\n\n\n###Finally, I have learned the following:###\n\n\n* Hawaii has the rudest customers - I don't get it. Does the sun make you the opposite of happy?\n\n\n* Anything that is Dodge/Chrysler/Ram/etc I didn't mention that but related from the same manufacturer is the \nmost common brand in collections. Do these automobiles attract people who make bad decisions?\n\n\n* Illinois has the most legal problems. Had an account where a unauthorized third party got the bill and stated the car is in police impound then went on to tell me that the signer has passed away and the consigner is in prison for the next ten years. Possible manslaughter case? In the same state I had some kid's parents call (think he was a trust fund baby) to help make a payment for his Range Rover tell me that their special snow flake was doing a county bullet and they would have him write a check or something. Illinois scares me.\n\n* If the account is past due even one day auto customer service is fucking completely worthless and cannot do anything and the account has to go to collections so I have to do THEIR job. EDIT: Forgot to mention, even if the account is current, I have to process a payoff quote, extension, give account number etc, so what DO they do that we don't?\n\n\n\n**These are the only two pet peeves I remember:**\n\n\n* Someone else calling while the signer or cosigner is in the background - why can't they talk to me or call me \ndirectly?\n\n\n* Driving while calling - well fuck you your acct info isn't saved. Did you really think this was a good idea \nanyway? Focus on driving your damn overpriced car! Calling in an area where they know cell reception sucks \nhappens too and putting me on speaker. Do you really want your account info all over the place where everyone \ncan listen and why would you call if you know cell reception sucks?",

This means we get to talk to the same people all the time.\n\nWe have this one older guy who calls in all the time and everyone on my entire team dreads getting him because every call with him goes exactly like this:\n\nMe: 'Thank you for calling Some Place. This is TheAutomaton speaking. May I have your name, please?'\n\nFunnyMan: 'Ah, well, now, Automaton, I don't know if we know each other well enough for me to tell you that my name is Funny Man.'\n\nMe: 'Ok. Can I get your account number, please?'\n\nFM: 'I don't know that I'm meant to tell a total stranger that my account number is 1111.'\n\nMe: 'And can you just provide your office location code and your office phone number, please?'\n\nFM: 'Now, Automaton, we only just met\\* so I don't know if I should be telling you that my office location is A2 or that my phone number is 3333.'\n\nYou would think he would be able to tell from the way I never even attempt to laugh or sound mildly amused that this isn't funny or enjoyable. Getting the caller's info should take 30-60 seconds. It takes about five minutes just to get his details and we're meant to keep our calls to seven minutes.\n\nIt's so painfully tedious. It fucks up my metrics. It makes it hard for me to make sure I get his information correct the first time and if you ask him to repeat anything he repeats the entire joke again! I'm not making this up! He will repeat the entire joke over again from the top!\n\nAnd what really sickens me is at the end of the call you can tell he thinks we really enjoyed this, because he always gives this indulgent chuckle like he's just amazed a toddler by pulling a coin out from behind their ear or something.\n\nEvery time anyone gets him they always mute their phone and then call out to the rest of the team, 'Oh no! I have that idiot who thinks he's funny and doesn't want to give you any of his information!'\n\nI wish he knew how much everyone dreads this shit.\n\n\\* I talk to him at least once a week, so we didn't 'just meet'.",

When I get home all that I can do is watch an hour of Netflix go to sleep and wake an hour or two before my next shift starts. No energy to apply for other jobs, study (before I dropped out) or really do anything that requires thought. I'm just so mentally fatigued when I finally get home. On the weekend it's a treat to not to have to think. All that I do then is sleep and maybe watch a movie or two. \n\nI'm not sure how much longer I can go with having to be mentally engaged all week long. I'll admit that supervisors have more stress than I do, but they can run to the vending machine whenever they want to which is a nice perk that I had before I start my terrible life as a call center rep. \n\nI've reached the point where I have no career aspirations except to have a job that doesn't require me to wear a headset all day long. \n",

This particular company doesnt send out plumbers after 9pm unless it's for a college or medical facility.\n\n\n[Disclaimer: this caller may have legitametely had tourettes or some sort of speech impediment. I don't have anything against disabilities and I'm not posting this to mock him, but the call was very peculiar and interesting so I thought I'd share.]\n\n\n\nAfter I answered, I was introduced to a fast talking, older gentleman and his rant went something like this\n\n\n\"Hi, hi, hello sir this is John Doe at 5555 Street Name Rd. 5555 Street Name rd.Yes this is John Doe we got a toilet broke not working and its all messed up. Got a new one right here ready to go just need help installing it was wondering if you could have a technician help me set it up as soon as possible thank you sir please this is john doe.\"\n\n\n\nSo I politely explain that the best I can do for him is to leave a mesaage for the office to call him back in the morning which he seems sincerely overjoyed to hear. Then he rambles on the same stuff basically.\n\n\n\n\"Yup 5555 Street Name Rd. John Doe need that toilet seat fixed kindly thank ya sir. Was wonderin if you could maybe send one of the guys out like maybe Matt or one of the others just as soon as they can...\"\n\n\n\nIm not even sure the plumbing company installs toilet seats but he seemed to be familiar with the company or people that work there at least. Idk. The way he was talking baffled me though. It wasn't a stutter really, he'd just repeat stuff rapidly and seemed excited like he was on drugs. I have a friend who has mild tourettes and his is more of a stutter or a gulp. I feel like this wasn't a disability or a prank call, just some old quirky dude possibly hopped up on meds or recreational drugs.",

After which it will be an additional $4.99 to your billing!\"\n\nEnter 5 minutes of bitching that she was TOLD it was the same package as her large company package and that she doesn't want to pay for it. Look I'm sorry they assumed you'd know that while we are one company now that the packages were created with contracts before the merger, they will vary. Also yes at some point you will need to pay to get this channel. I explain this as nicely as possible. \n\nMe \"I know this is frustrating, as I've mentioned if you want this channel you need this package and again it is free for 3 months. We could also lower your base package to something lower however you will lose your rebate credits as they require the package you have. The best and cheapest option is to accept the free 3 months and pay the $4.99 for that addition afterwards.\"\n\nOL \"This has made me so upset I probably won't sleep tonight!\"\n\nReally....

And then she got louder...and louder. To a point where I could NOT tune her out anymore and was starting to have trouble hearing my customer. It was clearly a billing issue, something to do with their PPV limit being exceeded - you probably know where this is going.\n\nFG: Wow, sounds like some serious shit is happening next to you.\n\nMe: [*a bit distracted trying to get some coding fixed on the account*] Hah, yeah no kidding.\n\nFG: Jesus, what is going on over there? I know it's a call center, but I've never heard another agent so clearly before.\n\nMe: Well, I'm not really supposed to say but it's a...uh...billing issue.\n\nFG: Wow. I knew you guys dealt with a lot of assholes, but just wow.\n\n*I politely chuckle and we fall into silence for a second while I finish updating the package codes in attempt to get his missing channels back. FG is clearly having a good time listening to the shit show next to me judging by the intermittent shocked giggles and 'holy shit's.*\n\n*LC has now started loudly saying something about she can't do that, it's not possible, that doesn't exist, her system doesn't have that option, etc.*\n\nMe: Ok, that should do it. We'll just need to restart your cable box and force it to update.\n\nFG: Sure thing! How - \n\nLC: **I DON'T HAVE A PORN BUTTON, SIR! I CAN'T JUST PUSH A BUTTON AND MAKE PORN HAPPEN ON YOUR TV**\n\nI have never heard someone laugh as loud and as hard as FG did. It was one of those laughs that was generated purely by shock and turned into a genuine laugh at something funny. It took everything in me to not laugh along with him, damn QA.\n\nLC immediately got shit for yelling and what she said, which made FG laugh harder since he could hear the sup freaking out at first. \n\nFG caught his breath, we fixed his issue, he thanked me for a memorable experience and asked me to pass the message on to LC if she still had a job (she did, but ended up quitting shortly after).\n",

So I worked auto collections from January to today and wow it was interesting and I learned a lot but the timing sucks ass. What really sucks is that I was referred to this job and before this I had an employment gap of a couple of months. I got out of the military after eight years in November last year, was unemployed for a bit and got referred to this job from the husband of one of my wife's friends. Doubt it will reflect badly on him or anything though as he is in another field with the company.\n\nWhat was the issue? Compliance issues with state laws. Too many of them so what sounds so minor, well it isn't and yes I get that each state is different but the idea of a one size fits all approach as much as possible, well that'd make too much sense - why not do a mini-Miranda for ALL states? I had it read to me when I called my mortgage company and I'm not in a state that requires it. Why not require written due date changes for ALL states? etc since each state has different rules it's easy to make these mistakes and you couldn't have stuff hanged up at your cubical to help you as that is sensitive information that and policies have changed with what you can and cannot say since I have worked here. The fact I gave my employee ID instead of my unique ID and it got caught, well that was a huge no-no. It was easy to loose your bonus over one of these mistakes. I had a coworker in my class processed an extension and someone said yep and you process it instead of them saying yes, well fuck you his bonus was gone for the month. It was getting to the point where the shift I worked paid more because of the hours but I never saw my family that much, the pay was OK for the time being, insurance was good but now a relief, me and the wife were spending time together earlier and we were laughing for what seemed like 30 minutes and we both haven't laughed that long or together in a while, like since before I started this job.\n\nThat and you had to be customer service centric but still had to collect so it was like walking on eggshells all the time because you can't be too soft and can't be too hard. I'm not the one to beat people up over why the fuck they fell behind and I'm too quick for my own good. Yeah I have a pretty damn good credit score for someone my age (29) paid my car off, ahead on my mortgage and a damn good savings between me and the wife so we are fine for now but with that said I know people don't have it that damn good as me so why give them shit or bug them over it?",
