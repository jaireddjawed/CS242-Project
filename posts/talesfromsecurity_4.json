        "text": "Hey guys I wanted to leave you with one of my top 3 crazy stories that had had happened while on duty.\n\nI do security for a big shopping plaza and our supervisor always tells us to \"observe and report\" but it's like he just wants it on record of him saying it because we all love to chase down bad guys even though we get paid shit. \n\nTwo months ago there was a hit in a jewelry store, keep in mind we have the jewelry stores inside the swap meet part of the whole plaza.  The first security to arrive wasn't armed, he heard the commotion the 3 robbers were doing so he acted quick. \n\nMy partner isn't armed and he knew at least one of the bad guys was  but he didn't care. He chased them down, got a gun pointed to his chest and once he saw the guy didn't shoot he grabbed one of the others and took cover. \n\nAs he grabbed that guy by the neck the other securities were on their way, the other 2 guys ran one direction and the other guy managed to get off the grip my partner had him and ran to a complete different direction as his friends did. As he's running the dumb fuck tripped ( who robs a jewelry store with their pants down to their ass?)  My partner got to him and practically left his batoon useless on him. The other guys saw this and shot one time (we don't know if they shot upwards to them or to a tree) and then fled.\n\n When they reported the incident I ran towards the jewelery store, when I heard the code for gun I walked, when I heard the only shot fired I took cover (I'm not armed either fuck that). When I arrived they had the guy on the ground and two other securities were chasing after the armed guys (crazy fuckers aren't armed either).\n\nAt the end cops came, after 2 weeks they had them and the guys got a 5 year sentence.",

This story fit one of the options for the writing prompt, and I sort of like the new version, so I decided to share it here for anyone who's interested.\n\n-----\n\nIt's a Saturday night, and the on-site coordinator has gone camping for the weekend. I've done my patrol of the buildings, and I'm sitting in the C-wing, makeshift table set up, watching \"Parks &amp; Recreation\" and the road, sort of wishing something would happen to break the monotony. As much as I enjoy Parks &amp; Rec, spending ten of twelve hours on shift watching it is a little much, and for the most part, the night's been quiet. There's a scrawny racoon that likes to wander the hospital, there was a skunk outside earlier in the evening, but everything's nicely settled down now. Since [Name Changed] is camping, I'm the only person on site—which is why there's even a guard out overnight. It's the start of fall, so sitting at the frame-without-a-door isn't too cold yet, but it'd still be good for me to get up and walk around.\n\nNone of the maglocks on doors that _are_ installed are working, and it's pretty windy, so every time the wind picks up and blows the door to the courtyard open, it makes a clattering sound and I have to go check on it. I'm a bit on edge, but luckily the only thing I've heard all night has been that door. The sun isn't up yet, but it will be soon, and that means there's only three or four hours left until my shift is over and I can go home. \n\nAnd then I hear something. I guess someone heard that I wanted something to do.\n\nIt's distant, but it definitely sounds like people. It's muffled, but it's loud, and it's constant. I can't make out what it actually is, but I know I need to go check on it. So I pause my show, get up, and walk this floor. The sound only gets quieter. I go up to the second floor, walk to the operating rooms above where I was sitting, and hear nothing. That means it has to be in the basement. I'm pretty apprehensive of the situation now, I'd definitely rather just go back and sit down and finish Parks &amp; Rec.\n\nBut I have a job to do, so I go back down the stairs, down to the basement. The sound gets louder. It sounds like... music? I walk towards the sound, slowly, into a big empty space between the D and C buildings. This room is filled with millwork and other furniture and equipment, stacked high on pallets, and worker's equipment. I find the source of the sound pretty quickly:\n\nIt's a radio. There's nobody here, the radio must have turned itself on. I unplug it, thinking \"that was anti-climactic\", and walk around the basement to make sure nobody's there.\n\nThe rest of the shift was uneventful.",

My entry gate guy was okay, his shirt needed ironing, but he was in compliance. \n\nThe exit gate guy was a total shit show.\n\n1. Unshaven.\n2. Untucked. \n3. No \"SO\" pins.\n4.

I dressed him down before turning my attention to his weapon.\n\n\"Are you chambered, at least?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n(Gritting my teeth in frustration) \"Are you cocked and locked?\"\n\"Nah, main, ah don't do dat, main, I cock it if ah need to, nawhudimsayin.\"\nI took his weapon after explaining why his course of action was suicidal at best when using a shitty holster like that. I tried the chamber a round and it stovepiped...first round...stovepipe.\n\nThe guards eyes went wide as he realized the mess he would have been in as I cleared the malfunction and tried again...stovepipe #2.\n\nWe managed to chamber a round by placing the round in the barrel by hand and slamming the slide forward. I gave him his weapon and told him that if he has to use it to be a sniper, because he only has one shot.\n\nLuckily, the night was uneventful, but I think my ass chewing worked, last time I saw him, he was squared away, he still had a ghetto attitude, but that Ruger on his hip in that Blackhawk level 2 looked good.

Yesterday I got a call from the husband if I wanted to work day shift today as it is normally my weekend and I work nights. I have been on vacation since last sunday So i figured why not. I was told I would be providing security for the building for part of the day and that is why I was needed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI get there today and go into the main meeting room at 10 where the COO, the CEO, the CFO, the 2 corporate police officers, the 2 regular security officers and about 12 more are waiting. I still have no idea what is going. I am then told the the COO’s wife found a message board this previous saturday where employees were talking freely to each other and thought it was private, until one of them gave their login details to the COO’s wife who is one of the company's top lawyers. Among the things they were doing on the message board was warning each other to correct (ie fake) there timesheets to say they were at the company when they were not, and since they were all programmers they could manually change the data where a regular employee could not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSO the COO then tells everyone that based on this he called a emergency board meeting at 8 and after receiving the approval from the board, the COO decided to fire everyone that had faked their time sheets, all 53 of them, roughly 5% of the department and roughly 80% of the people in charge of bug fixes. THE CEO and CFO were there to show unity among the board. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen they told us why were all there. They wanted us to personally escort each and every employee out of the office and may a big show of it. Where we would watch each person, pack their things, and with the help of IT, confiscate their laptops and work phones. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe whole process took about 1.5 hours. One programmer had to be handcuffed after getting aggressive. But the rest went quietly. The COO and the CEO booth sent out emails to the whole company explaining what happened and warned everyone else to not do the same.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter it was all done the extra hired staff myself included were told we could go home as we were no longer needed and we would be paid for 4 hours (the minimum my company will allow us to be hired for). I stuck around for a bit to eat lunch at the cafeteria as I am considered a regular employee and have access to employee benefits then went home. Free lunch, and 4 hours of OT pay for 2 hours of work, it was a great day.\n",

        "text": "This is a cautionary tale.  It isn't meant to amuse or make you laugh.  If anything, I hope it helps you.  If this post can save even one reader from a world of hurt, then the effort was worth it.\n\nPart I: The Clubs\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nPrior to getting my current position with a local police department, I spent about 6 years doing private security for a *lot* of different companies, always on the hunt for bigger and better positions, chasing that elusive raise.  It was during those pursuits for a better job that I had two close calls.\n\nWhen I initially got into security, my first few gigs were all in the [nightlife industry](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/4xlr5t/citizen_my_phone/).  There was a local company that did almost all the clubs and lounges in not just my city, but pretty much the entire region surrounding it.  We'll call them \"Club Security Inc.\"\n\nI tried in vain to get in with this company, interviewing multiple times over the course of about six months for various positions.  They never picked me up; they never told me why.  In hindsight, I think it was because they sensed I was too \"square\" to fit in.\n\nA couple years later, I left the nightlife industry and took an in-house graveyard position at a site across the street from one of the lounges that contracted with Club Security Inc.\n\nInvariably, it became my routine every Friday and Saturday night to go outside to the corner and light up a cigarette (or two or six) with my partner and enjoy the chaos, watching the bouncers pummel their way through fights, hip tossing people into the street and smashing car windows.\n\nAnd then one day... they got shut down.  I can't say how I found out without compromising opsec, but not only did a majority of their personnel have zero security licensing required by my state, ***Club Security Inc. didn't even legally exist, let alone have any state licensing to provide training or security services.***\n\nClub Security Inc. was shut down and fined into bankruptcy, to the tune of $1,500 per guard *per day* the company operated with no licensing.  The unlicensed guards all met various fates, everything from arrests for false imprisonment to ADW to similarly harsh fines for working security without a license.\n\nNow mind you, this wasn't some fly-by-night security company.  We're talking about a company with an established name in the local market, one of the \"big fish,\" so to speak.  It opened my eyes and made me much more cautious about job hunting.\n\nPart II: The Guns\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nA couple years after Club Security Inc. was shut down, I met Ronald Jackson.\n\nJackson seemed squared away, working an armed security post down the block near a restaurant I'd pick up chow from sometimes.  Each time I'd run into him, he'd greet me jovially and we'd chop it up, trading stories over cigarettes.\n\nOne day, Jackson hands me his business card and tells me that the post he's working is contracted to his own security company-- he worked the post for himself basically.\n\nJackson explains that he needs squared-away guys like myself and offers me (at the time) a dream gig, the kind we all lust after.  Great money, great hours, fully armed, the whole nine.\n\nI was reasonably cautious.\n\nA quick search on google revealed that Jackson's company was unlicensed (and therefore also uninsured).  I called up the state security licensing bureau and learned that Jackson, whom I saw each time with a Glock on his hip, ***had no security licensing himself, let alone a firearms permit.***\n\nI never saw Jackson again after that day, but rumors among the guys were that he got picked up by the Sheriff's Department on outstanding warrants.\n\nAs you settle into the new year and continue to better yourselves, I hope you take the time to research any company you wish to work for.  Do your homework, take your time.  \n\nYou probably hear people hoping you'll stay safe, and I'm no exception.  However, it's important to know what dangers are out there in order to do so.  Sometimes, they're right next to you wearing a suit or a uniform.",

I posted this story on r/talesfromretail but it fits better here.\nEdit: someone format it in the comments, go read that one\n\nSo I work as a security guard in this pretty big shopping plaza and about 3 days ago this happened.\nI was walking around my post when I hear dispatch (D) say.\nD:unit 1870 go check Mouse cheese and see what's going on 5-5 (police) it's heading that way.\n\nI get there and ask the manager of Mouse Cheese what's going on and they say they didn't call police, as I start heading out I see a patrol car outside so I go talk to him\n\nMe: Hey officer, my supervisor send me here and I already talk to the guys inside Mouse cheese, everything ok?\nOfficer: Don't worry about it, they didn't call, it was a personal call. He then proceeds to dial the victim while ignoring me.\nI then see the concerned customer (CC) coming our way and I decide to ask her if everything was ok but she ignores me and goes directly to the cop.\nD: Unit 1870 code 4? (Is everything ok?) Do we need to make a report? Me: negative swing 4 (dispatch) both 5-5 and customer ignore me, apparently it was a personal call.\nI then head to the restroom and when I come back the patrol car was no where to be seen. I go check if everything was ok and I see the CC, now with a male friend, she glares at me but says nothing. As I'm walking away she stops me and asks with an angry/concerned voice..\nCC: Hey, are there any cameras pointing this way? My car just got stolen and the police officer left because there was something more important he needed to do. (Probably an emergency but she said it in a condescending voice)\n\nFuck! I had just told dispatch everything was ok and now I'm gonna have to report it again.\n\nMe: Sure let me check. \n\n*To dispatch* Swing 4 can you check the cameras in Victor 2 parking lot (the area of the plaza the incident happened and the left side of Mouse* cheese building) to check on a stolen vehicle?\nD: supervisor I thought you said there was nothing to report. .. I'm on my way\nCC: I always park my car on that red wall (I could tell that *I always* part wasn't true because she wasn't the kind of costumers that go there) and now it's not there.\nMe: Are you sure you didn't park on the other side of that red wall?\nCC: (with an Oh fuck face) No, I park on this side.\nMe: Sure, can you describe your car for me please?\nCC: it's a 2016 white Kia\nMe: Ok, let me see what I can do for you.\nNow here's the thing about my workplace, if any car is gonna be stolen is not going to be a brand new car, Dispatch knew it as soon as I reported the description, I knew it and probably all my partners that heard it on the radio knew it too.\n\nI went to the other side of the red wall where she told me she parked her car but there was nothing. I went back to her and she now looked pissed since I was looking for her car.\n\nNow remember I told you we were on the left side of Mouse cheese? Well I decided to check on the right side of the building and there it was! (Keep in mind this is a very small building) A new white kia. I took a picture of the license plates and went back to the left side of the building.\n\nMe: showing the picture are these the license plates of your car?\nCC: Oh my god yes, where is it?\nMe: On the other side of the building.\n\nHer answer almost made me burst in laughter but I was able to contain myself. She actually said, \"well, someone moved it then, because I park right here\"\nSo know she didn't park on the red wall that was on the other side of Victor 2, she parked on the left side of Mouse Cheese.\nShe got inside her friends truck and drove to her car (I don't know why since the building is pretty small). At this moment my supervisor was already there giving me shit for saying everything was ok and even though it wasn't stolen I had to check first. He asked me if the officer processed a police report and I told him I saw one but wasn't sure if he actually processed it.\nNow, as you must know, if the police officer made the report she couldn't take the car but I decided to have a little fun with this info.\n\nI told them not to touch the car since she called the police and they could need some finger prints from whoever try to take her car (nobody did she just forgot where she parked). The guy friend goes all crazy trying to open the car and trunk with his elbows and she starts calling the sheriff's department (or 911 most probably). My supervisor and I where trying as hard not to laugh as she started telling whoever was on the phone that even though she found her car someone moved it from where she left it. Her friend then realized what was happening and my supervisor explained to him she just forgot where she park.\n\nWe left from there finally able to laugh.\n\nTL;DR: customer called the police thinking someone stole her car turns out she just forgot where she parked.",

Hope you enjoy!\n\n*Report posted as-is, with some information redacted to preserve opsec.*\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOn [REDACTED] at approximately 2200 hours, I was on routine patrol of\n[REDACTED] when I was flagged down by two team members in the [REDACTED]\nDepartment, who advised me of a disorderly individual at the rear of\nthe store. I responded to the area immediately.\n\nUpon my arrival, I observed a White male adult (henceforth referred to\nas \"the Subject\") standing in a large puddle of milk. The Subject\nappeared to be heavily intoxicated and/or under the influence of\nnarcotics, as evidenced by his bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, profuse\nsweating, staggering gait and inability to communicate in a coherent\nfashion.\n\nI was informed by a team member at the scene that the Subject had\naccidentally dropped a gallon of milk prior to my arrival and wished\nto purchase another. The Subject continually exhibited irrational\nbehavior, drifting between wanting to leave and wanting to purchase\nmilk.  I advised the Subject he was free to do either if he did so in\nan orderly manner, however the Subject did not appear to understand\ndespite me repeating this several times.  At several points during\nthis exchange, the Subject, unable to balance and standing obliviously\nin the milk, nearly fell several times.  Each time I took his arm to\nsteady him, he accused me of harassing him and continually insisted\nthat he had money and that he wasn't planning to steal (I made no such\naccusations).\n\nThe Shift Leader arrived on-scene at that time, and upon observing the\nSubject's behavior, advised him that he was no longer welcome and to\ndepart immediately.  The Subject started yelling angrily that his\nmoney had been stolen and began pointing at several different team\nmembers in the vicinity, accusing each one of theft.  [REDACTED]PD was\ncontacted for assistance at that time.\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of the Subject's actions and the\nhazard the wet floor presented, I subdued the Subject and restrained\nhim with handcuffs in order to preserve the safety of the team members\nnearby as well as my own.  I checked both cuffs for fit and\ndouble-locked them, then kept the Subject as calm as possible in a\nseated position until the police arrived.\n\nAt approximately 2215 hours, [REDACTED]PD Officer [REDACTED] (Star #[REDACTED]) and\nmultiple back-up units arrived to handle the situation to conclusion.\n[REDACTED]PD CAD #[REDACTED] was issued to this incident.\n\nThe Subject was removed from the property and taken into custody for\n[REDACTED], as well as advised not to return for any reason.  All\nparties departed shortly thereafter without further incident at\napproximately 2220 hours.  I sustained no apparent injuries as a\nresult of this altercation.",

        "text": "I was reminiscing and thought I'd share this story from a few years ago.\n\nOne of my first \"real\" security jobs was for a huge residential building in a touristy but crime-ridden area.  I was young, unarmed, and a complete idiot.  I had a lot of fun with my fellow young and unarmed idiots, getting into brawls and writing reports with ice packs on our heads.\n\nAt our site (which had over 20 levels), a typical shift only had three officers, so it was easy to keep busy.  But we always looked forward to New Year's Eve.\n\nEvery year, a bunch of party promotion companies would get together to rent out the first four levels of our building for a massive NYE party extravaganza.  It was a crazy affair, with balloon/money dropping from the ceiling at midnight, free champagne, $200 tickets, limos, laser lights, the whole nine.\n\nFor us security kids, it meant crazy fun.  For one, that was the one night that we were insanely well-staffed.  \n\nOn our side, we'd have a squad of 20 officers to patrol the entire building.  The promoters would hire on another platoon of 20-30 additional personnel, plus four or five off-duty police officers, two paramedics on stand-by, so we'd have plenty of cool folks to bullshit and hang out and smoke cigarettes with all night.  Between that and the cute girls flooding the whole place, you couldn't have asked for a more perfect storm.\n\nThat's the background to the story.  My second year doing the NYE party was the most memorable for sure, as you'll see...\n\nEven before I really developed an interest in law enforcement, I was always worried about safety on the job.  I spent my own money on body armor so I'd be protected as much as possible.  I got plenty of jabs from my coworkers, calling me paranoid or whatever.  They never did again after that night.\n\nAt about 11PM that NYE, two fights simultaneously broke out on two different floors.  All five cops stormed up to break up one of the fights, while I along with another five coworkers rushed to the other one.\n\nIt was your typical drunken party brawl, fists flying and drink glasses breaking in the darkness, periodically illuminated by brief flashes of colored light.  We waded in and each seized an arm, a leg, tugging and slugging until the combatants were all in cuffs.  Additional police officers had been called for assistance, and they arrived in the nick of time with a paddy wagon to cart off the offenders.\n\nI went with my coworkers to a quieter area outside to briefly decompress.  We all lit up our cigarettes and checked on each other.  \n\n\"You okay?\"\n\n\"Anyone hurt?\"\n\n\"Whoo, that was nuts.\"\n\n\"I'm good, bro, you good?\"\n\n\"That was crazy!\"\n\n\"OH SHIT, YOU GOT STABBED BRO!\"\n\nOne of my coworkers froze, then slowly turned around and we all collectively gasped.  Protruding crookedly from his right shoulder blade was a single hypodermic needle.\n\nThat's right.  Somehow, in the midst of all the chaos, some shithead (who'd presumably paid top dollar to get in) decided to pull out a hypodermic needle and stab one of the random six security workers trying to break up a fight.\n\nWe never found out who did it, and although it was a nail-biting six months of bi-weekly testing for my coworker, he turned out to be clean (thank goodness).  But it was a hell of a way to spend New Year's Eve.\n\nAs you all continue to work into 2017 and beyond, I wish you all nothing but the best and hope you all stay alert, never become complacent, and always perform your duties safely.",

Hope you enjoy!*\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nOn [REDACTED] at approximately 1745 hours, I was at a standing post outside [REDACTED] with the on duty LP when we observed a Hispanic male (henceforth referred to as \"the Subject\") approaching the store rapidly. The Subject was exhibiting erratic behavior and was muttering to himself with a vacant stare on his face. The LP Agent followed the Subject into the store and approximately 5 to 10 minutes later reported to me that the Subject had proceeded into the restroom.\n\nI approached the restroom waiting area and was informed by several guests that a person matching the Subject's description was inside one of the restrooms and complained that he'd been in \"for quite a while.\"\n\nPrior to taking any action, I advised the LP Agent to stand by the area while I consulted with management. Upon describing the situation and the Subject's behavior to the on-duty Shift Leader, I was advised to contact the Subject and ask him to leave immediately or he would be removed.\n\nI returned to the restrooms and knocked loudly on the door with my flashlight, announcing myself each time and asking if the Subject was okay. From outside the door, I could hear movement inside the restroom, including what sounded like a belt buckle rustling around, however there was no response from the Subject. I repeated this process at least three times with similar results.\n\nAfter several minutes, the Subject exited and I immediately noted that he was now sweating profusely, his pupils were severely dilated and he had an angered expression upon his face.\n\nDue to the close proximity and volume of guests inside the store, I contacted the individual again with the intention of assessing his threat level. The Subject's expression became even more furious when I tugged him on the sleeve to see if he could hear me, and he deliberately spun suddenly toward me (I was not blocking his path of exit at any point).\n\nDue to the Subject's heavy clothing and his concealed hands, I seized the Subject by his jacket collar and pushed him back to create distance, as well as to protect myself and those around me. I struggled with the Subject in this position until guests in the area were evacuated.\n\nThe Subject swung his right arm and it (I am unsure what part) collided with the left side of my face, at which I responded with several strikes to the Subject's upper body, which were ineffective. I brought the Subject to the ground, where he continued resisting. In order to gain compliance, I was forced to deploy my baton, which I used to strike the Subject's legs no more than three times until he assumed a position of disadvantage. I chose not to use my chemical agent as I was in a enclosed area and did not wish to risk cross-contamination. It was at that point that the LP Agent assisted me in placing the Subject into handcuffs, which I checked for fit and double-locked immediately afterward.\n\nDuring this time, store management had contacted the police for assistance. The LP Agent and I escorted the Subject along with his belongings to the back-of-house holding area, at which point [REDACTED]PD Officer [REDACTED] (Star #[REDACTED]) and multiple back-up units arrived at approximately 1815 hours to handle the situation to conclusion. [REDACTED]PD CAD #[REDACTED] was issued to this incident.\n\nThe Subject refused to self-identify to the Officers and was ID'd only after another arriving Officer recognized him from prior contact. Despite denying drug usage, the Subject's mental state was described by the Officers as \"altered\" upon assessment, during which the Subject demonstrated extreme difficulty answering what city he was in and what month it currently was. I gave the [REDACTED]PD Officers my statement and advised them that I wished to press charges for assault and to have the Subject banned from the store permanently.\n\nWhen offered, I declined immediate medical attention. I suffered no visible injuries, however my left cheek is currently tender to the touch and both of my forearms are sore.\n\nAs the Officers escorted the Subject from the building, he began resisting again, requiring three Officers to control him. Once outside, the Subject began feigning injury, laying in front of the police cruiser and shouting nonsensical phrases as \"make sure the wheels are locked prior to unloading\" repeatedly.\n\nParamedics arrived at approximately 1830 hours and took custody of the Subject. All parties departed without further incident at approximately 1845 hours. There is nothing further to report at this time.",

With the exception of some redacted information, everything has been left intact.  Enjoy:*\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nI was alerted by the on-duty LP to the presence of a suspicious individual who had been previously warned by store management not to return to any [REDACTED] locations due to multiple previous incidents. \n\nSuspect's MO is to enter the property, select and eat multiple hot food items with bare fingers, then select, open and consume alcoholic beverages while roaming the store, discarding the empty container(s) on a shelf before departing without payment. \n\nOn this instance, upon being alerted to the presence of the subject I proceeded to his location by the hot bar, where I observed him finishing food with his bare fingers and consuming an alcoholic beverage. The On-Duty LP Agent advised that he'd observed the subject selecting the beverage and opening it. \n\nI approached the Subject and identified myself, advising him of his previous warnings not to return. The Subject denied having ever been on the property and made several rapid contradictory statements regarding payment. \n\nIn light of the subject's previous interactions with upper management and security personnel, the involvement of alcohol as well as the fact that past verbal warnings were obviously ineffective, the decision was made to detain the subject for proper processing. \n\nWith the assistance of the On-Duty LP Agent and the Uniformed Officer I was relieving, we began to take the subject into custody via control-holds, however he was non-compliant, and began resisting so vigorously that my wristwatch was torn off my arm. At one point, the subject began digging his fingernails into my fingers with sufficient force to draw blood from my right index finger.  To avoid further injury and to defend myself against additional harm, I struck the subject several times in the upper body/face with sufficient force to daze him, at which time we were able to successfully restrain him with handcuffs. My injured finger was photographed for documentation purposes and I later self-rendered first aid. \n\nThe subject was escorted to the holding area and [REDACTED]PD was contacted for assistance. During that time, the subject resumed behaving in a non-compliant manner and refused to follow verbal commands. \n\nThe subject continued to be non-compliant until [REDACTED]PD Officer Ng (Star #[REDACTED]) and a backup unit arrived shortly after the call was placed.\n\nA police investigation revealed the following information:\n\n- Subject has recently been released from jail after serving time for outstanding warrant arrests\n\n- Since release, subject has been stopped/cited by [REDACTED]PD multiple times for various reasons\n\n- Subject self-medicates with antipsychotic drugs on a regular basis\n\nUpon being offered, I declined medical attention and chose not to pursue assault charges against the subject, instead opting to request that the [REDACTED]PD Officers give the subject a stern final warning to remain off the property, which they did.  After processing and trespass/theft forms were completed, the subject was transported off property by [REDACTED]PD without further incident. \n\nThere is nothing further to report at this time. \n\nEDIT: Formatting.",

        "text": "This is a story I've only told to a few people in real life.  It is 100% truth and it opened my eyes to the reality of working in public safety.  Whether you work armed or unarmed, there's always that critical moment where you find out what you're made of.  This story holds nothing back.  Every last detail happened to me.\n\nHere we go.  Apologies in advance if you find this a tedious read.\n\nI worked armed security in a neighborhood that was... rough to say the least.  Money was tight, but I loved my job.  I always kept my boots polished, my uniform pressed, my gear maintained.\n\nTo pinch pennies, my daily commute to and from my patrol route was always via public transit.  Since my post didn't have any locker storage available for duty gear (and the restrooms were... ick), I'd travel to and from work in full \"battle rattle.\"  It was just as well, because once I'd step on a bus, all the thugs jabbering in epithets in the back would suddenly go silent and I'd ride warily while they eyed my piece warily.\n\nA bit of background.  My duty weapon is a .40 caliber Springfield XD, with a Surefire X300 on her underside.  Her name is Khaleesi.  I love her because she's always by my side, at the ready, keeping me safe.  \n\nYes, my gun has a name and gender.  Call me what you will.\n\nEvery day, my shift would end at midnight and I'd ride two buses to get home.  It was always the transfer point that would make me slightly more cautious, because for anywhere between five and thirty minutes, I'd be smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood that was rife with muggings, stabbings and shootings, with open-air drug deals literally taking place in front of the local police station just two blocks away.  Addicts shuffled about the landscape slowly as if they were extras from the set of The Walking Dead, and far-too-young women plied their bodies for far too little with far-too-vacant expressions upon their faces.\n\nThat fateful night, as I got off my first bus and made my way to my second bus stop, I noticed something odd.  In hindsight, there wasn't anything that would've been strange to the average person, however I was already on edge thanks to my knowledge of the area.  Call it a sixth sense if you like, but the hair on the back of my neck stood up as I walked towards a small gathering of people at the end of the block.\n\nAs I drew closer, I started to make out what was going on.  A group of college-aged kids were standing at the end of the sidewalk, backing up slowly as traffic raced up and down the street behind them.  \n\nI felt oddly at ease as I continued to analyze what I was seeing.  Two females and two males, dressed in designer brands.  They stood out like sore thumbs from the decrepit location they'd found themselves in, and on each face was plastered a gaze of fear.  They were backing away from a shadowy slim figure, and if they'd kept going, they'd get hit by a speeding vehicle.  They were trapped.\n\nThe slim figure continued to advance slowly towards the kids, with his back to me.  As I continued toward my bus stop, which was just beyond where the scene was taking place, I finally understood the situation.  Clasped in the hand of the offender was a twelve-inch-long pointed screwdriver, spotted with rust and grime.  As the menace continued towards the group of youths, he'd make a jabbing and swiping motion with it every few steps.\n\nOne of the college kids, a male, stepped in front of his friends and threw his arms out to offer some semblance of protection.  They had nowhere left to go.  There was no time for them to call the police.  There was no one around to help.\n\nWhat I did next was completely automatic.  It couldn't have taken more than a minute at most, but it was as if I'd switched to some sort of autopilot, oddly numb, cold and emotionless.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\"  I heard the words escape my lips and felt my legs move, then plant themselves firmly in front of the thug with his would-be victims shielded behind me.\n\nThe thug offered no answer, just a grunt and an empty, soulless stare with his mouth slightly agape.  A black male no older than twenty-two years old, his jeans were torn and sagged well below his hips, a dirty gray hoodie barely concealing his unkempt mop of hair.  His pupils were about the size of golf balls and his sweaty face was peppered with pockmarks.\n\nI heard myself speak once again.  \"What the *fuck* are you doing?\"  The man's screwdriver wavered ever so slightly, its pointed end about four feet away from my armored plate carrier.  I felt the warmth of the four terrified kids behind me, blending with the wind of the traffic as it continued to sweep by behind us all.\n\nFrom my rear, I heard one of the youths cry out \"Get him away from us!!\"  Despite being so close to me, the words sounded muffled, almost muted.  But I heard them nonetheless.\n\nSuddenly, Khaleesi was in my hands, gripped and aimed directly at my enemy's center mass.  This surprised me, because Khaleesi rides with me in a Level III retention holster.  In order to draw Khaleesi, I had to lower my holster's hood and rock back a retention tab before the holster would allow me access.  To this day, I don't remember doing any of those actions.  As far as I'm concerned, one moment my hands were empty, resting on my duty belt, and the next thing I knew, Khaleesi had materialized in my hands.  That's exactly what it felt like.\n\n\"Drop it,\"  I commanded firmly.  The thug's expression tightened slightly and his gaze moved to the screwdriver grasped in his fist briefly before fixating on Khaleesi.\n\nHis grip tightened.  My index finger moved towards the trigger.\n\n\"I SAID DROP IT!\"\n\nThe screwdriver clattered to the ground as the words left my lips and its owner stepped back, stumbling slightly over his dirty untied shoelaces.\n\nMy finger left the trigger and returned to its original position above the trigger guard.  \n\nAnother command flowed out on its own. \"Walk away, do it now.\"\n\nThe thug nodded and started to pick up his screwdriver.\n\n\"DON'T FUCKING DO THAT!!!\"  My grip on Khaleesi tightened.\n\nThat did it.  The miscreant turned and sprinted off into the night, leaving the weapon behind.\n\nSuddenly, blood rushed back into my legs and I was able to move again.  I clumsily re-holstered Khaleesi and struggled to re-engage the retention hood as I turned to the college kids huddled behind me.\n\n\"Are you guys okay?\"  I mumbled a bit, feeling light-headed.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said one of the females as her friends nodded in agreement.  \"That guy had been following us for two blocks and pulled the screwdriver about a minute before you showed up.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" gushed the other female as one of the males (possibly her boyfriend) pulled her into a hug.\n\nI nodded absentmindedly and realized that my bus home had arrived.  I grunted *something* (I have no idea what) and ran to catch it.\n\nMy bus ride home lasted about twenty minutes.  I felt perfectly calm and relaxed, completely unperturbed.  It wasn't until I was almost home that it hit me all at once.  My heart suddenly started palpitating out of control.  My vision became blurred, my palms and forehead sweating uncontrollably, my chest tightening as my breaths became shallow and difficult.\n\nFor the rest of the night, as I took off my gear, ate a late dinner and showered, my whole body felt cold and my hands shook uncontrollably.  It all cleared up by bedtime and I slept better than I'd had in months.\n\nTo this day, I sometimes revisit that night and replay it over and over.  A few months after the incident, I purchased a copy of David Grossman's \"On Combat\" on a whim.  While my experience was not as extreme as some depicted in the book, I could relate to the physiological phenomena discussed.  I left the security industry a few months after this incident, went back to school and now work for a police department.\n\nAs we leave 2016 behind us to enter 2017, it is my sincere hope that you will all take the time to develop yourselves, especially if you work in public safety.  People rely on us, no matter how boring or slow your post is.  Never forget that.  \n\nOne day, an event will take place that will test your resolve and you'll find out what you're made of.  It is your responsibility to make sure you're prepared when that day arrives.",

        "text": "The problem overall resides in my security company's poor management choices, but my story is going to mainly center around my experience with one co-worker.\n\n~~~\n\nMy post is rather easygoing but for the longest time, this other guard drove me crazy. We'll call her Jackson. This girl had an attitude every single day. But it wasn't the snappy kind, I could handle that. It was the passive aggressive kind. She never did anything big at first, just a lot of petty stuff. Shoving past you if you're standing too close to the entrance, changing the radio station without asking, she would always be hiding in the corner on her phone but complain when I was getting overwhelmed and asked for a hand; things that slowly got under my skin. However, I tend to have a lot of patience. So I kept my mouth shut.\n\nThe final straw occurred when a fire broke out in one of the buildings literally right after I clocked out. Nothing huge, but enough to call the fire department. I asked Jackson if she needed me to stay so I could help out with the incident report or to at least call the supervisor (after I leave, she would be the only guard on site). She said she had everything under control, so I left. Thinking back, I should have called the supervisor regardless of what Jackson said.\n\nAs it turns out, she didn't write an incident report or call the supervisor or the property manager. The lead supervisor of my company heard of the incident for the first time when he watched the news that night.\n\nBy some miracle, Jackson wasn't fired. When asked about the incident, I told HR my side of the story: that I was already off the clock when the fire was reported, I asked Jackson if she needed assistance, she refused and said she had everything covered. According to the head supervisor, I wasn't in the wrong. However, Jackson had her pay docked.\n\nThis royally pissed off Jackson. What's worse, at some point, she somehow found out I was trans (I'm a female-to-male transguy who has been medically transitioning for two years. I completely pass as a biological male and other than HR and one other guard before Jackson, I am completely stealth at work, and I prefer to keep it that way). After this, she occasionally dropped subtle transphobic remarks (misgendering me, asking inappropriate questions etc).\n\nEventually, I found enough guards (and some employees on the property) who she had pissed off to come together and tell HR. They delayed the transfer repeatedly. After three weeks of delay, we went to the property manager. He told our management that he will find another company to work with if Jackson wasn't gone by the end of the week. Sure enough, she was gone by that Thursday and replaced with a sweet old guy.\n\nLast I checked, she was transferred to a post where she was on her own. She stayed there for a short time, but was fired when she called a supervisor a faggot.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE\n\nAs it turns out, Jackson learned I was trans when she overheard some supervisors discussing my file. A new supervisor thought that an outdated version of my file was actually my twin sister. The other, who had known me since I joined, explained that they were in fact the same person.",

I have lots of stories about this place despite my brief time there so I'll be posting a few of them now that I've been away from the job for a bit.\n\nThe site I worked at (contract security) was a small plaza that had a number of offices and a small mall with some dentists and a small food court with a couple restaurants, a couple coffee shops making money off of the people that worked in the offices. The point is that this building was mainly offices with a teeny mall so I wasn't exactly a \"mall cop\".\n\nSo I'm fresh from the guard accreditation process and I'm shipped off to this uptown site that I hear has a high turnover rate. Great. You *know* that if security schedulers are remarking about the turnover rate of a site, that site is *fucked*. The site pay was actually pretty OK and the job seemed cushy though so I say \"fuck it\" and go for the site interview.\n\nThe. Fucking. Supervisor. I'm let into the security office for an interview and the supervisor is wearing a plain white shirt (not the required uniform shirt), no tie (a tie is required at this site), and is missing a front tooth, and the rest of his teeth are rotting. So during the whole \"interview\" he barely lets me get a word in edgewise, just basically talks me through the site. Tells me that I'm going to be working weekdays 8-4, but that I'm supposed to show up to work the next day (Saturday) for noon-midnight, then Sunday noon-midnight for training, and then the following Monday at 8am for my first normal shift. Whew it's going to be unpleasant but whatever, glad to have a job and if I work for a few months maybe I can get a transfer.\n\nDuring my weekend training shifts, literally every employee of the building warns me about the manager. The weekend cleaner. The senior operator.  The cleaning supervisor who was on holiday but dropped in to say \"hi\".\n\nWoowee. So I show up for my first real shift on something like 2 hours of sleep. The manager is the smuggest prick you've ever met. If you call him anything other than \"security director,\" He'll correct you. If you make any kind of mistake, he'll correct you. And I have no problem with being corrected normally but the levels of condescension were off the charts with this guy. He even smugly accused me of misgendering a rather butch lesbian courier that approached the security desk (when I specifically used the term \"they\" because I was referring to couriers in general).\n\nAs for the first shift itself, it was awful. The \"director\" and I were the only two people on staff, and I was not allowed to leave the desk for any reason if he wasn't there to cover me. And of course, he was there for a total of about half an hour on that first day. Lots of meetings to go to! And when he wasn't at meetings, he was out taking a 20 minute smoke/bathroom break. Or an hour for lunch. Or whining that I had bought Subway and it smelled really good but he couldn't eat it because of diabeetus (but he could totally eat a super sugary Pad Thai). People kept showing up asking for the director or requesting information I had no way of knowing as it was not a part of site training and he was never available to pass the query on.\n\nDespite that I got more and more knowledgeable by fighting for every bit of information I could wrangle out of him. Asking as many questions as I could. Improving every day. Shifts were not fun at all because it was essentially \"sit alone at a boring desk all day and you can't respond to any incidents that you actually have training for even though these incidents are happening all the time.\" \n\nThe moment I knew I was going to quit very soon: he was on lunch we get a call on the radio from the cleaning supervisor that we have a homeless person sleeping in the food court. The security director does not respond at all. I poke my head around the back corner and ask if he wants me to respond to the call. \"I'm *on lunch*\" comes the angry reply. OK then. I walk around and sit back down at the desk. Of course, the next person the cleaning supervisor calls is the property manager's office. I get a call from the property manager's receptionist. I let her know that the director is on lunch, which is good enough for her because she's worked long enough to know that the director is so diabetic that if he delays lunch for 5 seconds he'll die. The receptionist then calls the *junior building operator* who used to be a guard at this site to finally get the homeless guy to leave, which could have gotten lots of people in lots of legal trouble if anyone had reported anything. The whole process took 20 minutes.\n\nOh and how does someone that lazy, unfit, universally reviled and with poor hygene get promoted up the ranks and keep a \"Security Director\" job for (apparently) 10 years? Two reasons. He has a saccharine-sweet way of addressing the only people who could get him fired - AKA property managers and their associates (he was so well liked by the property manager that not even his bosses could fire him without jeopardizing the contract with this site), and the fact that he was doing the Operations Manager's job for no extra cost after that particular property management company cut the position from their payroll.\n\nThere's lots more because the job sucked but I'll leave that for future posts if there's interest.",

There was no way this guy was going to be hitting the gym any time soon, there's more fat on my little finger than on his entire body! \n\nHe has 2 boxes of fragrance in his hand and is in a bit of a hurry, typical suspicious scrotbag behavior. I see him picking up an eyeshadow palette and start to head towards what I thought was the door, I run out thinking holy shit I'm gonna nab this guy, feck yeah! He appears around the corner heading towards the door about 30 seconds after I get there, with a box in his hand but none of the other 3 items are in sight. He either a) dumped them, or b) bagged them. I can't take the risk, being new to this role in the store, so ask him if he's paid for that shaver in his hand, he says yeah, the usual \"bitch I can get you fired!!!!1!\"\n\nI make the *****terrrible***** decision to let him go, as I don't have concealment of the original selected goods (he still could have dumped them, though cctv disproved that once I got back to the camera room) nor did I have selection of the razor.\n\nGuess who saunters in today and makes his way straight for ***the same goddamned fragrance brands as Sunday?*** \n\nScumbag! I radioed it through and then my radio stopped receiving messges (but worked again once he left?) So I did the (theoretically) logical thing and hover around him, to discover that he has a friend, great news. He ran off, not having selected anything this time and after yelling at me for \"victimising\" him, and \"accusing paying customers of being thieves\". Most of my colleagues are alright, except the guy who had been in the camera room as I called him in. He's a sexist twatwaffle that thinks I'm there to look pretty and sleep with him. I get raged at for hovering near Scumbag, he won't listen to my explanation, and tells me I'm a piece of shit for ruining our chances of catching him, then says had I just called the police on Sunday *which I had wanted to do* ***but had been told not to by another colleague*** we wouldn't be in this situation. \n\nSorry for this being so long, it's just been one of those ridiculously awful days and I need to get his out there. Any advice for a wee lp girl who's struggling to be taken seriously in a male dominated field? I'd honestly appreciate any kind of tips or advice relating to work!",

Our bar doesn't allow standing as it is too small of an area and we are considered a restaurant.\n\nIt's a Friday night, and the restaurant is packed to capacity. A middle aged couple rolls in, and they say they want to just go to the bar. I tell them our upstairs is completely packed, including the bar, but if they wait, I can get them situated. I finish checking id's for a giant group and get them seated. When I get back to the door, I see the couple going up the stairs. I follow them up. I told them politely we were full and to wait. The guy starts calling me a dick. I tell him I'm just enforcing the rules and there isn't any room. He's not having it. He wants to be able to stand at the bar anyways. He keeps telling me that I'm being a dick and tried pulling the \"I'm a local\" card. I told him that I don't care, and that I am too. At this point he starts to get more irritated. He then starts getting in my face telling me to get fucked, flipping me off in my face. I told him if he didn't like what the rules are, he could leave. As he's leaving, he starts flipping me off again, fingers in my face. We start exchanging words by the stairs. He stops part way down and wants me to go ahead of him. I didn't trust him, and told him to keep moving.\n\nFrom the top of the stairs, I see his girlfriend start pushing things off of the podium at the front door. We walk down the stairs, there's a giant group in our common area waitin to be seated. As he walks passed them, he raises his voice talking shit to me and saying we are rude, no one should come here, yadda yadda yadda. As he's leaving, he stands in the doorway, talking more shit about me and the restaurant. At this point I put my hand on his chest and use my body weight to push him out the door and yell to him \"beat it, kook!\"\n\nAs I'm trying to shut the door, the girlfriend grabs it, opens the door wide, pulls her arm back and takes a swing at a me. I grab her arm with my left hand, blocking the punch, while simultaneously trying to shut the door. The dude sees this and goes apeshit, screaming \"don't fucking touch my girl!!!\" He charges at me, takes a swing and misses, to which I get him in a head lock and am holding his fist down by his legs. At this point, there is a giant crowd around us. We break it up, and the guy continues to run off at the mouth. Customer steps in trying to break it up, and gets punched in the side of his face/jaw.\n\nDude and his broad took off shortly after. Customer that got hit was super chill. Felt bad cuz those punches were meant for me. But, it is what it is.\n\nAnd if the dude who got hit just so happens to read this, I still owe ya a drink.",

        "text": "Venting. I have some stories I want to get off my chest. Security supervisor, also an EMT, so I have a working understanding of basic medical procedure, chain of care, patient privacy / rights, handling of sensitive information, UoF procedure, psych holds, etc.\n\nFull disclosure here. A lot of ER staff fucking hate me *because* I'm not stupid and I know what can and can't be done. ER nursing is an entirely different subset of nursing. In my experience, it's a high stress environment full of bitter, wretched, overly judgemental people who take their frustrations out on each other, patients, other staff, everyone.\n\nThey misunderstand what our job is. They think our job involves forcing people to comply. Our job is to ensure no one gets hurt and everyone's rights are respected. We are not **ATTACK** dogs, we are **GUARD** dogs. Full stop. \n\nHere's a list of stupid shit I've seen:\n\n-----\n\n1. \n\nA doctor deems a patient has nothing medically wrong with him, orders him discharged, then wanders off. The patient refuses to leave. We arrive and give him a \"move it or we call cops\" ultimatum. While I'm talking to the patient, **two male RNs walk up and GRAB THE GUY UNDER EACH ARM.** The patient freaks the fuck out but does not get physical, merely struggles. I immediately order the RNs to stop, and they back off and give me dirty looks. I ask everyone to clear the area except the translator and security, but they ignore me and stay put.\n\nIt's clear that the patient knows his rights but wants to be belligerent. Whatever, we've dealt with that before. The charge nurse notifies PD. We call PD anyway to verify because we don't trust the ER not to lie to us again, since they've done it before.\n\nFemale cop shows up, ten minutes later. Immediately, a female nurse sarcastically whines, \"Oh, *you're* real useful. We were expecting a big, manly, scary cop.\" The cop says something dismissive and defensive, then gets to work. She immediately orders all hospital staff except security to clear the area. *Now* they listen. She tells the patient he needs to leave. He's still refusing. She goes to the hall to call for backup before proceeding.\n\nAnother RN asks me why we can't just drag the patient out. I say \"He hasn't hurt anybody. He's been verbal so far. He gets a warning regarding trespassing from us, another from police. If he still refuses, he can be fined for trespass. If he continues to refuse, he gets arrested.\" She then says \"Oh, well next time before we call you guys, why not just get him to hit one of us then? We could've skipped this whole process.\" I thought she was joking at first, but I then overheard her suggesting this to no fewer than two other nurses for the duration of the incident.\n\nThe doctor comes back, angrily demanding we remove the patient immediately. He shouts at me, asking why I haven't removed him yet. I say, \"We can't touch him, he hasn't done anything wrong.\" The doctor tells me flat out, verbatim, \"You're useless. You're useless to me. Get out of here, there's no reason for you to be here. Leave. NOW.\" **The doctor then dives at the patient and grabs him by the arm.** I order him to release the patient. The patient is now panicked, but my reaction relaxes him somewhat because I reach for the doctor, who isn't listening to me. The cop overhears the commotion, comes back in, sees what is happening, and orders the doctor to stop. She chews the doctor out for almost escalating a situation to violence unnecessarily.\n\nTwo more officers arrive. \"Vamanos o encarco,\" says the new cop, dangling his handcuffs in front of the patient. The patient finally stands up and leaves property under our joint escort. As the police leave, I overhear them complaining to each other about how unprofessional everyone is and how they hate coming to this hospital for any calls. I apologize to them, and thank them for their help. That's about all I can do.\n\nOh, and write a report on the doctor's conduct. I heard it was actionable. :)\n\n-----\n\n2.\n\nI was asked by an RN to escort a homeless guy out of ER. Nothing medically wrong with him. I verify with the RN. The RN says she already called police. I tell the patient that police are on their way to escort him out. The guy is basically quivering and crying, trying to get us to let him stay. The nurse said he was screaming at her before I showed up. Probably true, I thought, because my cop-style uniform sometimes does calm some ragers. My post guard later corroborated that he was indeed screaming at her before I arrived.\n\nAs I'm talking to the patient, the nurse is behind me saying \"he's stupid,\" \"he's an idiot,\" \"I already told him this,\" \"he's not smart enough to understand.\" The only reason she's saying this shit is because I'm basically between her and the patient.\n\nI ask the patient to come outside with me and take a seat so we can discuss his discharge. He listens, goes outside, and immediately starts complaining about how she was rude the moment he walked in. I go back in, I take the nurse aside (who is a charge nurse) and ask her who called police. She outright tells me, \"I don't need to tell you that, just drag him out if you have to.\" I said, \"I need to know for my report. I need to know who called, at what time, and what information was given.\"\n\nShe eyerolls, does an übersigh, and says \"We didn't call police.\" Well, now I'm in investigation mode, because now she's lied to me. She says, \"Well, I had someone go do it, but then asked her not to.\" I ask who. This enrages the RN. Her tone turns notably hostile, and she orders a nurse over. She dictates a narrative to the new nurse, and says \"tell him that.\" I abandon the venture because it was clear that she was a control freak and was simply pissed I wanted to make sure I did things right.\n\nThe enraged RN then *commands* me to \"get rid of the guy or [your director] will hear about this.\"\n\nI call PD, PD shows up in three minutes, and escorts the guy off. Done. I document the RN lying to me about incoming PD because I very well could have been standing there waiting for them to show up for upwards of a half hour.\n\n-----\n\n3.\n\nNot really a singular incident, but more a series of trends. Whenever I showed up to any combat code that required restraining a patient, *without fail,* some dickhole RN stands behind me being useless, insulting and escalating the patient, feeling nice and safe because my team is holding the guy down. This makes my job harder and oftentimes they know it.\n\nNotable examples:\n\n* I'm holding a guy down, he's actively resisting, tripping balls. A nurse is going through the patient's wallet behind me. He finds a Disney member card. \"Oh boy, what have we here? Aren't you fancy? Disney season pass and everything! Aren't you a tough little squirt.\"\n\n* \"Thanks man, you're making the security guard actually work for once, heh.\"\n\n* \"You're just wasting everyone's time, asshole. We could be helping someone else right now. Worthless leech.\"\n\n* I'm pleading with a man I'm holding down to just relax. He indicates back to me that he \"can't relax.\" I had an excellent prior rapport with him and know that he's schizophrenic, not in full control of his actions, and he's fully aware of it. I tell him, \"well if you can't relax, that's okay. We'll help you. Just try and stay calm, [name]. It'll be okay. I won't let anyone hurt you.\" He nods, thanks me, relaxing a bit, but he's still hyperventilating. And then, some asshole behind me says, \"We'll wrap you up tight if that's what it takes.\" This causes the patient to struggle at full strength again. Fuck, I was so mad. I had it.\n\n-----\n\n4.\n\nAnother discharge. The guy doesn't want to leave. Combative code called. The ER calls PD while we're investigating. PD shows up, they bring the patient outside. The patient is demanding copies of the documents he's signed, and he's entitled to them by law. The RN refuses to give him those documents, saying \"we don't have to.\" I jump the chain, get them from another charge nurse (not charge that night), and I go to deliver them to the patient since the second RN was \"too busy\" to deliver them.\n\nWhile I was gone, the RN must've remembered that I *report* her bullshit and abuses. She prints the exact same documents, **HANDS THEM TO THE POLICE OFFICER,** and has him go deliver them to the patient outside. She then sees me holding the same papers, chews me out about violating HIPAA (the irony), yanks the papers from my hand, and orders me to leave. I call my director. He calls her director.\n\nI handled that information in the course of my duties. I wanted to prevent another combative code by eliminating any reason this guy would want to come back later that night. I am bound by signed NDA not to abuse patient information, making me an eligible proxy to deliver that paperwork. Patient privacy statutes dictate that we are not to disclose patient information to any government agent except where required by law. To make matters worse, the patient was a narcotics user. By giving those papers to the officer, the RN was effectively disclosing *all* of that information to the officer, exposing the hospital to risk and liability.\n\nGuess who won that interdepartmental fight? Me.\n\n-----\n\n5.\n\nA nurse calls me and says a patient requested his money go into our safe. I show up, and find her in his room, counting his money *without a witness present,* a huge fucking no-no. She walks back out and tells me \"he's changed his mind. We don't need you, you can go.\" She walks off. I decide to speak with the patient anyway, just to let him know the service is available should he change his mind. I enter the room. I'm halfway through introducing myself when that nurse reenters the room, grabs me under the arm, and starts trying to force me back out into the hallway. \n\n**Mind you, I'm in a crowded, busy ER. I was immediately in defensive mode, worried I might've just been jumped by a psych patient from behind.**\n\nWhen I see it's her, I say, \"excuse me. Don't put hands on me. If you want to talk to me, tell me.\" She suddenly flashes this servile little smile, as if I'd suddenly forget she just yanked me from behind. She says, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. Let's go outside and talk?\" She meant outside the ER, motioning to the back door.\n\nBut my history with this woman, like with so many other ER nurses, told me not to trust her. I refused to go anywhere to have any discussion with her without a witness present. She refused to speak with me \"in front of patients.\" I suggest we speak at the nursing station. She says, \"no, nevermind, I'll just call your boss.\" She phones my director. As is typical (since I do my fucking job right), he sides with me.",

        "text": "[Posted this in r/Portland last week and was told you guys over here might enjoy reading it. Cheers.]\n\nI work Security at one of largest building in downtown Portland, OR and have experienced three major protest in my time working at the building. The first of which was a Black Lives Matter protest that took place. The other two are Anti-Trump protest, the second of which just occurred and turned into a riot (though not near my building). I wanted to write about this because I feel that this may one day be important and I don’t want to forget what I felt or experienced being witness to such events. \n\nThe first time I ever worked security I remember being overly paranoid, exploring a parking structure for druggies or break ins, I was constantly looking for death around the corner, like some deranged lunatic would come out and stab me as I opened the door. I have a background in martial arts, so I guess part of that comes with the territory but I’ve always believed a healthy sense of paranoia keeps you on your toes. “Stay alert, stay alive.” I always tell my coworkers jokingly (I used to be an avid Call of Duty fan for those who wonder about the reference). \n\nSometimes it’s not a joke though. I slowly realized security work wasn’t something to get worked up over. Most of the time you’re just checking doors, setting up barriers, circling the perimeter and monitoring the area. When shit hits the fan though, you have to be Johnny on the Spot. Yes I eat my fair share of donuts and drink a lot of coffee but I’m not a cop, I can’t just tackle a guy stealing something, but I can be the one to respond to a medical emergency or tell the police where that aforementioned thief went, what he took, and what he looks like. \n\nI remember the first time I witnessed a protest downtown. The Black Lives matters protest was going on not too far from my building. We had just gotten a new director of security, a middle age, 20 years retired service, police officer from Chicago. He stayed late to watch and monitor the protest. As it went by I remember the awe I felt by the sheer numbers and sound. It felt as if they shook the walls as they marched by shouting in unison. We locked down the entire building as they passed. \n\nI had witnessed protest on TV, in history videos, and other forms of media but never in person. The power of a collective unit is nothing to made light of. You can literally FEEL there presence from a few blocks. I’ve never experienced that or even imagined that the movies that depict armies marching and the ground shaking might hold some reality but they do. \nThe whole thing lasted about 8-10 minutes but it felt much longer. Ultimately they passed by peacefully the police trailing along. Officers updating us from the outside as things occurred. That moment stuck with me though, the reverberating echo stuck in my mind like a raw chord on a violin. The vibration of the ground like the deep bellow of a cello. \n\n-\nOn November 8th I watched tentatively as the election results were tallied. I couldn’t help but stop for a second every time I passed the TV to see where the election would head. That night, right before I left Donald Trump was a president, and a small group of people walked by the West entrance to where I worked with only a sign or two as they all shouted “FUCK DONALD TRUMP, FUCK DONALD TRUMP!” \nI didn’t even begin to fathom what was beginning but I came to work the next day the same as any (Indeed the sun did come up, as Obama had claimed to predict the following day).\n\nI had heard that the group had gotten bigger and made their way across town. It didn’t surprise me really. I joked with a co-worker… \n\n“They probably had people slamming open there window sills being like 'Would you guys SHUT THE HELL UP! I’m tryin’ ta sleep!' a guy would shout from a high story apartment.\"\n\n“'We’re protesting Donald Trump’s presidency!' a protester would shout meekly heard, followed by a chime of ‘fuck Donald Trump’\"\n\n“Let me get my shoes on” would be the tenants reply. \n\nSure enough, that wasn’t far from the truth. That night I saw several groups. News helicopters now took to the sky to cover the protest. All across Portland they split up to pound the pavement and spread the word. Again we had another officer feeding us intel from the streets, updating us of their location should we need to secure the building. Comforting given you have no clue what’s going on otherwise.\n\nI was patrolling the Parking Structure across the street when I began to hear the faint collective “Fuck Donald Trump! Fuck Donald Trump!” I began looking around from the top floor of the structure frantically trying to figure out where it was coming from. All of the sudden I see them begin to round the corner. I inform my lead what’s going on. They begin to pass directly underneath me… “Not my President! Not my President!” I hear them echo.\n\nSome have signs, some outfits, a few appear to be handing out flyers of some sort. I start to count, first batches of 5, then 25, then I start lumping them into circles of approximately 25... too many to count. Atleast 200, maybe 300. I watch as they pass on of the major roads. They stop and start to lump together. A motorcyclist pulls out in front of the other vehicles stopped at the light and begins to rev his engine in what seems to be support. The crowd begins to cross, barely fitting to the entire intersection little lone the crosswalk. The motorcycle continues to rev his engine, cars begin honking… I can’t tell if it’s support or annoyance. \n\nLater that night it happened again, a different group made their way by, passing the West entrance to the building. Still chanting “Fuck Donald Trump! Fuck Donald Trump! Not my President” and we locked the building down. I was ordered to monitor from the South end and watched as they walked by, again seeming to shake the walls. I’m in awe but I’m not afraid, just alert. I count maybe 300 this time, more than before. The line doesn’t seem to end. They all stick to the street for the most part. One trails from the side, comes in to order coffee, I watch cautiously but nothing happens. He says “thank you” and yells “Fuck Donald Trump” as he exits, raising his coffee in appreciation to the baristas. \n\nEverything goes off without a hitch but two of the doors outside get tagged with graffiti that is completely illegible and does not appear to say “Fuck Donald Trump” or “Not My President”, in fact it in no way resembles an acronym or combination of any of those letters as far as I could tell. Most of the night goes by without incident and then towards the end of my shift (which comes at the witching hour of midnight) a group crosses by again, this time to the North. They are perhaps the smallest of the groups I witnessed but are still enormous in presence. My lead said one wore a Hockey Mask that he stared him down as he threatened to enter the building, but the protestors friends pulled him away and screamed “Sorry!” through the glass.\n\nI go home tired, still getting all of my duties done, but I have no energy and fall immediately to sleep. \n\nThe following day (just this night, November 10th 2016), I knew before going to work there would be another protest. I put up a post on Facebook asking people to pray for everyone downtown, and hope if they were not religious (I myself am not but that’s irrelevant). My friend told me that someone I went to college with and his ex-girlfriend were both in the protest last night and that she really hopes they’re going to be okay. I can’t imagine what I would do if I heard something had happen to them. The guy is a musical genius and his old girlfriend is a peach, both very young and intelligent people with their whole lives ahead of them. I also worry about my old director who joined the police force here in Portland. All of these people are wrapped up in this. Everyone I say goodbye to on their way home from the Tower are here at ground zero for this thing. \n\nI remember watching the night before, seeing them go by, some cops monitoring from the sides and just thinking… “What if this falls apart?”… All it would take is a gunshot, or one of the cars to hit a protestor. The protestors would turn to help their fallen ally and trash the car, then the police would trash them. I go to work head heavy, full of fear for my loved ones and a heavy heart for what might happen. Friends on Facebook talk about the protest blocking traffic on the highway, saying simply by being loud they are breaking the law. Everyone’s talking about it but nobody knows. I just keep thinking “They’re all at home watching the news and reading about it on the other side of town, they’re not there waiting for that first Molotov cocktail to be thrown… waiting for the moment chaos ensues. They can’t smell smoke or feel the ground tremble, they have no clue” I think haughtily imagining the scenarios last night could have turned into. \n\nI think about how fragile it all is, I even get somewhat emotional and tell my friends to stop joking around, stop talking politics, and understand how serious it all is. For the first time in a long while, I became very childish on Facebook and threatened to delete someone if they didn’t take it seriously. Cute. Real cute.\n \nThat night, I anxiously await things to go down. The whole night goes quietly until the last few hours. I hear they’re assembling at Pioneer Square beginning at 530 but things don’t begin where I am until around 830 or 9. Then comes the shouting voices. “Fuck Donald Trump, Fuck Donald Trump.”\nWe’re not entirely sure from where, but I’m ordered to pull the pads from the doors as we lock down the building. I’m then told to go monitor from the third floor. At first I can’t see anything, but flashing lights, red, blue, white… and then I hear someone over a loud speaker. I go to put my ear to the window but the glass is too thick so I move North more, to a corner of the NW side of the building. \n\n“This is the Portland Police Bureau…” The voice commanded from the load speaker. \n\n“There have been members of protest engaging in riot, including vandalism, assaulting police officers with rocks and other projectiles…” They continued.\n\n“If you are engaging in riot, you are subject to arrest and use of force. If you are engaging in arson, you will be prosecuted.” \n\nChills crept down my spine as I hugged the pipe next to the glass, eyes unable to look away from the police cars and riot vehicles crossing the street. \n\nI’ve lived here my entire life. I grew up in a small mountain town. It feels like I’m dreaming but this isn’t a dream… this is real. Portland, the nicest place I’ve ever known, where people can jump into strangers conversations on the street and be welcome. Portland the place where at worst you have to worry about a smelly homeless person asking you for change and then not being quite sure if they were really homeless or just a hipster trying to make a phone call. Portland, the place where Darth Vader rides around on a unicycle playing the imperial march on bagpipes… has a riot squad riding on the backs of Ford Explorers, directing traffic, publicly announcing over a loud speaker…\n\n“If you wish to peacefully assemble please proceed South to Pioneer Square where you may PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE” they advised.\n\n“The area is blocked off. Again, there have been members partaking in riot. If you wish to peacefully protest, please assemble South to Pioneer Square where you may do so PEACEFULLY.” The police drone on, proving it’s a real man behind the speaker and not a recording like you get at the drive-thru’s before you order. \n\nI can’t look away, I’m stunned. I watch as the line of people make their way South, chills still going down my spine, goosebumps down my arms. Has this ever happened I wondered? Have there ever been groups like this? I’ve lived here my entire life (save for 3 years when I was an infant and my family moved here), I have never once witnessed anything like this. \n\nI wonder when the last time this happened. I feel like the world is coming undone and I can feel it all around me. What do I know of that is in anyway reminiscent to this? All I can think of is things we watched and read about in school like Vietnam protest where people laid down in front of tanks. Martin Luther King marching for Civil Rights back in the day. That’s all I can think to compare it too but is it really so noble as that? I just don’t know. I can’t shake the feeling that what I’m witnessing is something important, that I’ll tell my children about this one day, or say “yeah I was there!” but still I worry. I’m actually scared this time. Scared that my friends are out there, scared that someone’s going to get shot. \n\nThe police continue to entice the protesters along to Pioneer Square while directing traffic, and I actually feel they’re being very respectful to their right to protest. We all are. Here in Portland, people tend to support activism and free speech, if a women wants to grow her armpit hair out to feel independent and free we tend to say “You go girl” but as I mentioned the impact of such a collective is nothing to joke about. An officer reported there were members of the protest breaking out windows as they go along before they reached us. Before the police reached us. \n\nI spend the rest of my night escorting tenants and guest to their car, telling everyone to get home safe and be careful. A strange fog looms over the city, and I can’t help but wonder… is it smoke or just fog? The crows a caw as if it were the early morning and no one had pandered to them with scraps of bread or left over McDonalds. I look down from the Parking structure trying to see the protesters but buildings obstruct my view. The night winds down and though I stand ready to secure the doors, all I see is police and riot squads talking, a couple of parked cop cars. I hand out a few directions for people to get home, some safe pleasantries and before too long the night is over. \n\nAs I head home, the fog is lifted as I cross over the bridge out of the city, and the lights to the freeway are clear as day counting to the horizon. I turn on my radio and head home, letting my family and friends know I’m safe. \n",

There's less work, but surprisingly more chaos and more bitterness. I can tell my co workers legitimately despise one another and there is nothing I can do about it. That's not a mentality I ever want to hold and try to look at everyone there as friends and family. They can depend on me and I can depend on them.\n\nWell... Because it's retail you get common customers. Not even a week in I've had to defuse violent situations, scold rough housing, etc. But I try to do it with a smile and with their best interest at heart. I'll probably get in trouble for going along with a customer's prank to chase him out of the store to fuck with his friends than we laughed and shook hands afterward. I don't care... I'm telling this story to any futute employer as I am proud of this development lol.\n\nThere's a specific kid who comes in with his mom who legit thinks I'm a transformer robot. Cause I'm so box shaped from being a former athlete and my uniform colors. Just as he saw me there was a scuffle where a manager wanted me to throw out a customer and I refused. I told him that would be discrimination and if he wants to leave of his own accord that's his choice. If he tries to steal I will prevent him from leaving until he puts it back or pays for it. But I will not stoop to being some felon moderator who justifies shady crooked actions as \"business ethics\" or \"property rights\".\n\nThe kids eyes widend as he saw me standup to what he assumed to be my boss (he's not... I'm third party contracted so he'd have to call my firm and complain.) and I looked at the kid and back at the manager and in my deepest voice I could said;\n\"Freedom belongs to all sentient beings...\"\n\nProof was the situation solved itself as everyone got a big smile on their face than I was told there was a racoon in the back of the store \"autobots ROLLOUT!\"\n\nI will let up and down boats decide if I am the best or worst security officer...\n\nSeason two alert: a decepticon is in our midsts complaining to management I spend too much of my time talking to cashieers. Cashieers I help them with their work and give morale support when they say they want to quit.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/59a58a/tales_from_the_hospital_blood_guy/",
        "text": "I'm a security officer for a hospital. You can check some of my other posts on here for examples of some of the other [crazy patients](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/54eypn/zyprexa_the_porn_star/) I've encountered. This story is one that we all remember and retell at work fairly often, because it was just so bizarre. The worst part was that nobody else seemed concerned about this...\n\nWe generally have at least two security officers around our hospital Emergency Department (ED). One security officer is in the ED searching patients as they arrive via ambulance, while the other mans a security checkpoint with a metal detector for walk-in patients and visitors. The main goal is to keep weapons and other dangerous items out of the ED, but of course we also watch out for any signs of potentially disruptive or uncooperative patients who may become a problem later.\n\nOne night I'm the officer in the ED and a female officer is at the checkpoint. She calls me over the radio frantically saying she needs help at the checkpoint. I make my way up there and when I get there I see a pile of bags on the counter absolutely *covered* in blood. It isn't just a little bit of blood either, but these bags look like they have been exposed to a *lot* of blood for quite awhile. Some of the blood is dried and caked on, while other splotches of blood look fresh and are still wet. Upon closer examination, there are three bags: An expensive leather computer bag, a medium-sized camera bag which appears to contain a very high-end camera, and a weather-proof plastic case.\n\nI ask what happened and the female security officer claims that a guy who was completely *drenched* in blood from head to toe came in, tossed the bloody bags onto the counter and began ranting about a dog and someone kicking down the doors of his house. He also claimed there was a gun in the plastic weather-proof case. She wasn't sure what else to do, so she kept all the bags and sent him to go check into the emergency department. \n\nNaturally, this is all a bit odd. I get a red bio-hazard bag and place all the bloody bags into that, then notify our supervisor of what is going on. He seems pretty mystified as well, so we decide to start by asking the patient what his deal is. Unlike the claim that he was \"ranting\" which the female security officer had said, the guy seemed oddly calm. He insisted that the blood was from a wound on his head (which was incredibly small) that he had obtained by tripping over his dog at home. \"The little bastard likes to hide under blankets!\" he kept saying. *Ooooookay...*\n\nSo next we ask why he brought his computer, camera and a gun to the hospital with him. This is when he says that he lives in a \"bad part of town\" and someone had \"kicked down the doors\" of his house, so he didn't feel safe leaving his \"valuables\" at home while he came to the hospital. *Ooookay...*\n\nSo we ask him if we can put his gun and other items back in his car, because we really don't have a place inside the emergency department to store firearms, particularly when they are covered in blood. Nope, we can't do that he says, because all the windows of his truck are broken out and the doors are chained shut. *Oooookay...*\n\nSo this guy's story just gets weirder and weirder. We go outside to check out this truck and figure out which one he is talking about pretty quickly. As he said, the doors are chained shut. Also, the entire bed of the truck is filled with trash, including empty beer cans. The more bizarre part however is that the entire cab of the truck is soaked with blood just like the guy and his bags were. The windshield had so much blood on it that there was no way he could have driven it like that. It literally looked like someone had exploded inside the cab of his truck.\n\nNormally, [HIPPA](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/) requirements prevent us from being able to release much information about a patient to the police. However, when we suspect a crime has been committed, we can report that. So we got permission from the medical staff and called the local police. This guy lives in another nearby city and claims his \"dog\" incident happened there, so we notify that police department as well. \n\nUnfortunately, neither police department seemed willing to take any significant action. The police department in the other city checked their records to see if any murders had been reported at this guy's house but since there weren't any, that was the end of their interest in the issue. Our local police did come to the hospital, examine the truck, examine the bags and interview blood guy... but blood guy just repeated the same story and apparently the blood by itself wasn't enough evidence to prove a crime was committed, so they didn't take any further action either. \n\nI wrote an *incredibly* detailed report about the incident and included video footage of the guy entering the hospital as well as photographs of his truck covered in blood. This was just to cover our asses later, in case it turned out this guy did commit some crime and we were accused of not reporting it. \n\nWhen Blood Guy was discharged I got his stuff out of the biohazard bag a and returned it to him. He opened the gun case in front of me because he said he needed to \"check the serial numbers\" on the weapon. When he opened it, I saw what was in it. He had a brand new [1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol) in the case, completely clean, no blood and looked like it had never even been taken out of the case. He took his stuff and we never saw him again...\n\nStill the weirdest thing I've ever seen working here... ",

        "text": "I don't actually work in security anymore, but I do security consulting stuff. most of which is dull as hell, and doesn't really concern the readers of this subreddit. I started out as a plain ole' guard many years ago though. anyways, I'm pretty drunk at the moment, so forgive any spelling mistakes.\n\npart of the usual gig when doing my job is a basic interview with the guards on site. most of the time, this is a general formality, to make sure that what is being done matches what the paperwork says is supposed to be done. y'all know the drill, I'm sure.\n\nso my company picks up a gig at a banking office building, and I draw the straw that means I'm interviewing the nightshift guards. keep in mind, none of this is a surprise. they're told that I'm coming, and when I'll arrive. I'm pretty charitable in my reports, as long as you give me an answer that vaguely matches the established operating procedures, you get a pass. \n\nthis is the first time I've ever recommended that a guard just be fired, as opposed to remedial training.\n\nso there's two guards on duty for nightshift. let's call them A, and B. \n\nI roll up to the front doors around midnight. Operating Procedure would be that I at least get carded to verify that I am who I say I am. no one does. but that's not completely unusual. sometimes the guards just that told that a VIP will be rolling in, and no one wants to make waves. but still, a note gets made. \n\nnow, they were interviewed separately, but for brevity's sake, I'm going to compile A (who passed with flying colours) and B (who I recommended get fired)\n\nA: is in regulation uniform. black dress pants, black dress shoes, white uniform shirt, with name-tag and epaulettes. \n\nB: is in dark jeans, running shoes, and uniform shirt, without name-tag or epaulettes.     \nkeep in mind, Canadian law requires that security guards wear some sort of nametag.\n\nokay. off to a bad start, but let's see where this goes.\n\nso, for this bit, keep in mind, they're very much an \"observe and report\" security. they are not expected to be physical with anyone. \n\nQ1A: you suspect that someone inside the building is not actually supposed to be there, what do you do?\n\n(expected answer: verify identity)\n\nA: ask them to come to the security desk to verify their identity    (not a perfect answer, as the employees have security badges, which would have been good enough. points for politeness)\n\nQ1B: they refuse to provide proof. (expected night-shift answer: report to supervisor, proceed as directed)\n\nA: ehhh, call the supervisor(said in a questioning tone, but good enough)\n\nB: kick them out. \n\nme: pardon? you're only suspecting at this point\n\nB: good enough. I have a degree in criminology. if I suspect that they don't belong, that's good enough to kick them out of the building.\n\nQuestion: someone approaches the security desk and says that they've lost their badge, and are trying to enter the building. what do you do? expected answer: verify identity and employee status\n\nA: ask for ID, and look them up in the system (DING DING DING)\n\nB: probably let them in.\n\nme: pardon? \n\nB: I have a degree in criminology. I'm not getting any bad vibes off them, I'm going to let them in the building. \n\nQ3: if you were in charge of security of the building, what would you change? (this question is almost always super useful. security works in the building 24/7, and will usually give super helpful answers. y'all live this stuff, I'm just strolling through)\n\nA: I would do X, Y, and fire security guard B.\n\nme: pardon? (X, and Y were helpful answeres, which i made sure A got credit for, also, I do at least try to not give leading questions in my interviews) did you say fire B?\n\nA: I've been here less than a year, and I've seen B sleep through entire shifts, he never shows up in proper uniform, and when he's not sleeping through shifts, is playing games on his phone, and he never does proper locked door checks\n\nme: ... okay. I'll make a note of your comments... (this general sentiment was repeated by afternoon shift (constantly late, never in proper uniform), and morning shift (never in uniform, left doors unlocked that shouldn't be) also, I'm sure you readers will already comment how very much unliked someone has to be before the rest of the guards will sell them out like he just has been\n\nB: I'd fire the head of security and I would be head of security for this whole place (security head is part of IT and several other departments). there's too many rules that slow down security response (again, security is observe and report, not really paid for dangerous work) and I would get rid of that stupid rule about security not banging employees in the building. (security has a rule against fraternization with employees, obv)\n\nme: pardon? rule against banging employees?  (B is drastically overweight, balding, and frankly, not much to look at, and frankly, I'm in shock)\n\nB: there's probably a dozen cuties that I would be having sex with, if not for the rules against it\n\nme: the rules against fraternization? \n\nB: yeah. I have a university degree (y'all seeing a pattern here?) all these bitches would totally be down on my dick if they weren't worried about losing their jobs.\n\nme: thank you for your input, I'm sure you'll be hearing about the outcome of these interviews from your superiors.

        "text": "this is an x-post from /r/idontworkherelady. Am just now discovering the existance of this sub. I edited the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/57qb3s/move_the_fack_outta_my_gad_dam_parkin_spot/?st=iuc96x8o&amp;sh=9fb8af67) to better suite the format of this sub.\n\nIt's my second shift at my new post. It's a large 8-story annex building containing multiple banks, suits, etc. It's a very nice place with fountains and spiral marble staircases. Everyone is over-the-top nice and polite, making eye contact and wishing me a good night as they leave. My duties are to patrol at my leisure, and maintain an atmosphere of calm and safety. Best post I've had yet.\n\nI pull into one of the two reserved parking spots at the front of the parking garage, grab my stuff, and walk in to start my shift. Everything is going normal when in walks your stereotypical ~65/yo white old guy, aka Angry Man.\n\n\n&gt;AM: Hello, sir. I pay *thousands* of dollars for this parking spot outside and someone is parked in it!\n\n&gt;Me: (customer service mode activated) I can understand how frustrating that can be sir. I'm actually security for [building], I don't really have anything to do with [public parking garage]. The main office is actually directly across the street; I'm sure they could help you.\n\n&gt;AM: Ok well I'm calling to have this car towed. \n\n&gt;Me: (ugh) Right. Well I'll come out with you to get the info and make a report while you do that.\n\nWe walk outside.\n\n&gt;Me: It's this white Escapade?\n\n&gt;AM: What? No that's *my* car! It's this god damn black Tucsan that's in *MY* spot.  (points to the black Tucsan in the space right next to it, which is actually my car.)\n\n&gt;Me: huh? That's my car...\n\n&gt;AM: *YOUR* car?!? **MOVE YOUR GOD DAMN CAR OUT OF MY SPACE!!!1!**\n\nThis dude's eyes started bulging out of his face as it turned bright red; it was like something straight out of a cartoon. \n\n[fully_triggered.png]\n\nAt this point I *still* didn't fully comprehend the situation.\n\n&gt;Me: Wait, if that's your car parked right there, then I don't understand the problem. You are currently in your reserved space, right? One of the spaces is reserved for the active officer on duty.\n\n&gt;AM: DO YOU KNOW WHO THE **FUCK** YOU'RE TALKIN' TO? [gets in my face; I visibly cringe from his garlic-drenched breath] You will get in your god damn piece of shit car and **MOVE** it.\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, you need to calm down. One of these spots is reserved for the active officer on duty, which is me. If you have a problem with your reserved space, call the number for [public parking garage]. I'm security for [building] and have nothing to do with [public parking garage]. I will not abandon my post, risking my job as well as everyone's safety so you can park inches from where you are currently parked now. \n\nI start walking back toward my post, with this dude behind me actually throwing a temper tantrum. There is a lot more back and forth, with me remaining completely stoic and repeating the same, \"sorry, I can't help you; you need to leave\" line, and him slamming his fists down on my desk and cussing me out, demanding me to \"move your fuckin car, so help me god. I don't give a shit! Park on the fuckin street!\"\n\nHe kept asking for my name and the managers number, (throwing his business cards at me to write on). I eventually gave in and gave him my first name, and the number for HR just to get him out of there. (Good luck getting a hold of them, buddy.) Even if he did get a hold of them, he is essentially just telling them I'm actually doing my job, so I really don't care.\n\nI did get my super obviously sarcastic, snarky \n\n&gt;\"Have a *wonderful* day :)))\"\n\n in, to which he scoffed and replied, \n\n&gt;\"fuckin' *faggot.*\"\n\n Extremely satisfying.\n\nI started video recording halfway through the altercation, and snapped a pic of his plate numbers just in case. After my shift when I went out to my car, he had even left another one of his business cards under my windshield wiper. wtf?!?\n\nWhat is wrong with this guy? It took me half of the conversation until I could comprehend that this guy was actually screaming and cussing me out because he had to park in the space *DIRECTLY NEXT* to the one he usually parks in. Like literally *inches* away, which was actually *CLOSER* to the building. wtf...\n\n**tl;dr angry old man throws temper tantrum because he had to park 10 inches to the right from where he usually parks.**\n\n*edit: I realize I wasn't entirely clear about the parking spot situation. The reserved parking spaces are just two parking spaces right next to each other that say \"reserved.\" There are no numbers or letters, like \"A\" or \"1\" to differentiate them. Both Angry Man and my security company pay for 24 hours access to one of the two spaces. Even if I was in the wrong, I still could not have left my post to move the vehicle. It would be grounds for instant termination, and if an emergency were to occur in my absence, I would be held personally reliable for any damage or injuries that may occur. Appeasing a narcissistic old man verbally assaulting me is not worth risking the safety of others as well as my job, which I love and appreciate very much.*",

        "text": "Posted this story in an ask Reddit thread about what rule exists because of you and decided to share it here as well, with a bit more detail. This happened almost 5 years ago and it's still used in classes for new security guards as a training example by those who know it. Enjoy!\n\nI was working as a loss prevention officer a few years ago, and at this one store I was working with a partner. This rarely ever happened, but this week we were doing a \"blitz\" to catch shoplifters and try to deter the huge problem at this particular store, wasn't exactly in the greatest area. This is nearing the end of the week, we're about halfway through our shift and bored when my partner sees a woman shoplifting. So we follow her and as we have to prove intent we have to let her pretty much walk out the door before we can make the arrest. So she does exactly that, we follow her out and make the arrest. She struggled, so of course we had to use handcuffs to restrain her, and she wasn't exactly tiny either. It took both of us wrestling with her arms to get them behind her back, after which we escort her to the back of the store in to the employee only area where our \"office\" was. It was less an office and more a desk tucked in to a corner in the back storeroom next to the receiving doors, very open area, lots of things lying around, not exactly a secure area and only one store in my city has a holding cell. This isn't that store. She had no ID, gave us a name which later proved to be fake, I took the info we had and called it in to the local police force to come pick her up. And so began the waiting game, as she was no longer resisting or combative it wasn't a very high priority call. My partner did the paperwork, I took pictures of the product so it could be put back on the floor, supervisor showed up and decided to work the floor while we were tied up. \n\nAn hour and a half after the initial arrest she is whining mightily about needing to use the bathroom - apparently she had a few beers before coming to shoplift. We talked it over with our supervisor, and he gave me and my partner the go ahead to take her to the bathroom. So my partner takes the cuffs off to make the bathroom trip easier, as he's male and I'm female I get the lucky task of being in the bathroom itself to make sure she doesn't try anything, but when she finishes and leaves the bathroom with her arms out fully expecting the cuffs to go back on, my partner instead tells her if she behaves he won't put them back on. This is where the mistake was made. We go back down to our desk and she cooperates, for now.\n\nHalf an hour later, still no officers, my partner wanders off to use the bathroom, and this is when the shoplifter sees the odds are now in her favor, especially since I am easily half her size. I'm sitting finishing up the paperwork but angled so I can see her in my peripheral vision, she stands up, grabs a 3 foot long chain - for some reason this thing was a keychain for a single key, which was at one end, and had a wooden round block kinda like a handle at the other. And it was thick, think of the small chains you find on some shopping carts with the keys that you have to put money in to to unlock, that's the kind of chain this was - I saw her stand so I stand up and face her, and holding on to the wood block she starts whipping me with it. I finally grabbed the chain after the third hit, ripped it out of her hand, tried to half wrestle half hold her and block her to keep them from leaving - note that I have zero combat training at this point and my loss prevention training a month prior consisted of shadow someone for a week and hope something happens - while yelling for my partner. She then starts choking me to the point I can no longer scream for help, small scuffle ensues, I'm trying desperately to break her grip on my throat and beginning to panic thinking she might not stop until I pass out and maybe not even then. You know how people sometimes talk about being in a situation they wet themselves? That was me at this moment. \n\nAfter a few seconds that felt like eternity she finally lost her grip on my throat after bumping in to the doors that led out to the store, store clerk heard the thump and sees the struggle and calls out over the intercom for help for me, I yell again for my partner, he comes running, grabs her and throws her to the ground. I ended up tossing my handcuffs to my partner as his were in his bag across the room. Shoplifter is in stitches cause she thinks from the conversations prior to this we've screwed up and she'll get to walk - supervisor was correcting some errors in the paperwork during his check ins on us while he was there - I go looking for my supervisor and find him outside talking with the police officer that had just arrived, who is in the middle of filling out the paperwork to release her on a promise to appear - fake name had no record and this is an option for minor offenses. As this now has turned in to an assault, that goes out the window and as this officer is alone another car needs to be called down cause now they need to transport and book her.\n\nWhen the other car arrives, the first officer - who now has the chain she used on me as it's being seized for evidence - looks at the two new officers and says \"now, I'm not a forensic analyst or anything, but I think we can all agree this was the weapon used\" while holding the chain along my arm, where there's a perfect welt that's formed. The two new officers agreed with that statement. Then as they went to swap my handcuffs with theirs, the one officer unlocking mine after putting theirs on sees mine are pink (side note: I hate the colour pink, but I thought the idea of putting pink handcuffs on people was hilarious. Yes they're still legitimate, it's just a paint coating on the non moving parts), looks from my cuffs, to me, and goes \"really? Pink handcuffs? Are they fuzzy on the inside too?\" Which of course got everyone laughing, me included, which I needed as I had started hyperventilating again from my freak out over this incident.\n\nYear and a half later I find a news article on this shoplifter. Turns out she was sentenced to prison for stabbing her husband to death prior to my encounter. She was out on bail during my incident. I knew it was her, because I half recognized the name in the article - I was given a notice on court proceedings in case I needed to testify and the name was different from what she had given us - and the third last paragraph mentioned she had been released on bail then remanded in to custody after assaulting a loss prevention officer. I may have instantly forwarded that article to my supervisor now manager who was there that day. I am so glad she didn't find the knife that was later found on the counter across the room from where we were. \n\nTo this day I'm still used as an example in classes as to why you never remove handcuffs if you have to put them on in the first place, and my company quickly adopted a policy of handcuff everyone for your own safety after that.",

        "text": "So, I worked security at a military installation that housed a service academy for about 5 years, starting in 2010. i don't do it anymore, but i still work for the gov at another facility, doing background checks now. \n\nbecause this installation was home to a service academy, the school had D1 level college sports, including a football team. Football teams play in stadiums, so we had one on post, inside the gates. during home games, we would shut down the roads around the stadium a few days ahead of time so that the MP's and security could make sure that nothing that posed a threat to the game could get in. we would set up temporary pedestrian access points at a few locations around the stadium, and all gates had signs posted with items that werent allowed past those points, mostly your typical stadium restrictions; no weapons, no umbrellas, no outside food, no booze, etc. \n\nwe had a drop off box where people could drop their stuff if it was restricted on their way in, but we would tell folks that we were not responsible for their belongings, and that it would be safer for them to take their restricted items back to their vehicles rather than leaving them there. alot of times, folks wouldnt pick up their stuff when leaving, and we would end up with boxes of stuff like knives, beer, flasks, and umbrellas that would get thrown away at the end of the season.\n\nwhen the game got underway, and pedestrian traffic through the gates slowed, we would rotate through positions inside the stadium as well, and had breaks where we could get food at concessions and sometimes even watch some of the game, as we no longer needed to have full presence at the pedestrian gates.\n\nanyway, we had a guy that was a retired E6 start working with us, and somehow this guy had been on active duty for 20ish years without a single deployment, even though this was post 9/11. guy turned out to be kind of a dipshit, and was very slow at doing his job, so of course we started calling him slowpez.\n\nNow, slowpez had been through our training, and all, but this was his first day working full duty as a certified security guard there, so he drew the short straw and had to work the stadium instead of one of the main gates. he quickly showed that he was a bit inept at working the pedestrian gates, it was taking him forever to wand people in, and to go through their purses or bags.\n\nwell, he searched this one lady's backpack, and she had a bunch of sandwiches in it that she was trying to bring into the game, so slowpez told her she could drop it in the box or take it back to her car, she chose to drop it in the box. no big deal, common stuff. well, at some point after things slowed down and we started rotating, no one was paying attention to slowpez, and he decided to eat that lady's sandwiches out of her backpack. of course, she came back to get it after the game, and all her food was gone, so she asked what happened, and slowpez pipes up that he ate them, and they were good sandwiches. the rest of us were just like what the fuck dude? somehow we managed to not laugh in front of the lady, and slowpez ended up getting a negative counseling statement. idk how he avoided getting fired for that, but it was definitely something we laughed about for years afterwards. i still cant believe he did that, much less just owned up to it like it was no big deal and told that lady she made good food lol\n\ntl:dr; new guy was a bit off, ate somebody's food, and when she asked about it told her that her sandwiches were really tasty.",

        "text": "Just gonna give a bit of a backstory first. We have a bathroom in the vending machine lounge of the hospital I work at that's quickly and easily accessible from one of the main entrances, so it's become quite the favorite for people to have some fun in.\n\nI was training a new guy on second shift and we decided take a break in the lounge. We were sitting in a booth that was off to the side, but was still in sight of the bathroom, when I happened to look up and see a woman walk into the bathroom with two men following after. I grabbed the trainee and we both headed to the bathroom and listened in. I decided I wasn't gonna do anything until either they walked out, or I heard something that warranted me knocking, so I stood there for a minute hearing nothing but a little bit of whispering and some rustling sounds. After a bit they turned on the sink, and we could hear some slight moaning, so I called down another officer and the supervisor so they could get a look at what was happening.\n\nWhen the other officers arrived, the supervisor immediately banged on the door and told them to open up. The door opened to the wonderful sight of an older black man, fully naked, with soap suds all over him, with a nice collection of knives and a bottle of vodka sitting on the sink. My supervisor freaked out and just yelled, \"What the fuck is going on in there?!\". The guy tried to explain himself, saying that they were kicked out of the homeless shelter and were trying to take a shower in the sink. He yelled at them to get their clothes back on, get their stuff together, and get out. We ended up calling the on-site LEO who arrived a few minutes later with the Security Coordinator. The ~~third~~ second guy walked out and sat at the table trying to start a casual conversation with us as if he didn't know what was even going on.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the other two walked out with their clothes back on, and we escorted them to the exit and simply told them to never come back. The whole time, the woman was talking about how she was gonna go somewhere else with her \"pimp daddy\" and finish their fun. One of the other officers went back to the bathroom to see the mess they left behind, and radioed for us to come back as soon as we could. When we went back, we were greeted with a putrid smell coming from inside. The officer walked out and said that there were clothes covered in fecal matter sitting in the trashcan, and needle caps were lying in the sink. We had to close off the bathroom as it got cleaned and sanitized.\n\nLater that night, the \"pimp daddy\" came into the ER right before our shift ended and was complaining about a pain he had in his leg or something. The on-site LEO immediately confronted him and told him to leave, not only because of the incident earlier that day, but because he had come in a few times before lying about symptoms so he could get some pain medication.\n\nIt's been a year since that happened, and I have yet to see any of them return.",

She had to catch a bus, which I realized was suppose to leave right that second. I guided her to the bus stall (I'm not obligated to do this, but she was kind of pretty) just as the bus left.\n\nKnowing that the buses sometimes stop outside the front of the terminal, I guide her there, telling her she might have a chance to catch the bus after all. And the bus does come down the road, prompting me to confidently say \"Oh, yes, there it comes.\" before it sped past without stopping.\n\nI was standing there, dumbfounded, but she saw the humor in the situation because she giggled and told me I was cute. She was standing close enough for me to smell that she had indeed been drinking. She asked if she could give me a hug for my effort, to which I obliged, only at the last second she leaned in and gave me a kiss instead!\n\nAt this point, the auto-locking system engages, which signals that the terminal is closed and the terminal attendant is going to show up soon to lock the manual doors. My actual job is to make sure no one hassles him while he does his.\n\nTaken aback and surprised by the woman's bold move (she might've been three to five years older than me, if I judge correctly), I awkwardly mumble that I have to do my job and she gives me a sly smile and walks away.

        "text": "Worked for a while at a local casino during a week long event for bikers. The casino I worked at had a good chunk of the parking lot turned into a fairground-esque area with food trucks, custom bike companies and (of course) a nightclub with strippers. Now after all that's said and done, my shift was spent looking over the outside nightclub due to all of the alcohol and equipment being left out for the night in the Mohave monsoons. Now the nightclub was in a corner of the parking lot; you'd having to walk a good five minutes to go around the fence to the street. However, when the nightclub was open, they opened the fence up so people could get through easily.\n\nSomeone thought the fence stayed open.\n\nNow I locked myself inside the area so no one would get in. I told him this. He insisted that it'd be fine and it's cool and he wouldn't do anything wrong, the usual. Of course, I kept saying that he had to go around. It didn't take long for him to get violent; he shook the fence, grunted, pretty much would've pummeled me if a fence wasn't between us since the fence stopped him. So I called in for backup. While they took their time (it was very busy), my new \"friend\" started calling me things one wouldn't say in church and whatnot while still thinking we were best buds. Unfortunately, it was at this time that the Food and Beverage Head came around to check on the security of the nightclub, which obviously was having an issue. Now the Head is well known for causing the company to have a high turnover rate, so I'm obviously nervous that my friend here'll get me fired. And I just started too.\n\nSo I lied to my friend, saying that he could go through as long as he behaved. The Head didn't like that, obviously, but I whispered to him that it was a ruse (thank god drunk people need to be yelled at for them to hear you). Fortunately backup finally arrived shortly thereafter and my friend didn't catch my bluff in time before he was handcuffed and taken away, now angrier than ever. The kicker? He had a warrant out for robbery.\n\nOnce I got off work I decided to take a taxi home instead of the bus, cause fuck it.",

        "text": "A couple of weeks ago I was sent to the second campus at the university I work at. Now I'm normally posted to the big \"main\" site but every now and then I get sent to the smaller second site due to lack of staffing as we have to keep a certain staffing level. I don't mind it sometimes, it's a lot quieter there, more relaxed, as the students there have been in university long enough they behave, unlike first year students. This story is about the dumbest things I heard over the radio during one incident that made me loose much faith in humanity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*********\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's late in the morning, I'm out doing parking tickets with the only other person at this site, when we hear over the radio there's a call for a fire alarm at one of the residences on the main campus.  We think nothing of it, it's not our site, so we continue on with what we're doing but still half listening to the radio. Seems pretty standard, except finding out we no longer have working keys as they decided to change all the locks in that building, without telling us and without providing us with the new key so we could, I don't know, grant access to the fire department in the event of an alarm. Even the fire technician didn't have it, luckily this was during the day with someone around who actually had a key to let them all in. Then when they're finishing up and relaying the cause, this is what I hear:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Coworker1: the cause of the alarm was the caretaker, washing the smoke head, with a garden hose....\n\n&gt;Coworker2: ...thats... right up there with the water in the paper shredder.....\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI did a double take as I was only half listening to my radio as I was in the middle of writing a ticket, so I quickly sent a text to both coworkers to confirm what I had heard. Apparently, the caretaker thought that because the smoke head was so covered in dust, it would be easier - and a good idea - to simply take the garden hose to wash it off, not realizing that this is a fairly sensitive piece of equipment - not to mention water + electricity = bad - that MIGHT think the water being sprayed on it is a sprinkler head activated and trip the alarm.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs for the paper shredder, turns out there was an old supervisor years ago who thought pouring water in to the paper shredder to loosen up the paper was a good idea. The shredder didn't last much longer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe things some people do that they think is a good idea astounds me still. My head hit the desk a few times that day.",

        "text": "So last night while working an overnight shift at a local university, I ended up with a call that turned in to one of those stories. I'm sure everyone knows what I mean, the ones that get referred to as ones for the books, usually because it's that ridiculous and nobody can believe it happened. This is my one for the books story. It's a bit of a lengthy one with some backstory so please bear with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's just after midnight, the university I work at has two main campuses, both of them are mostly quiet - the bar at the one I'm at is going full swing but they seem to be handing things just fine, and I'm taking my turn on the desk. I don't mind the desk, it's a chance to sit and relax, and on overnights it's particularly quiet and rules get relaxed a little. Everyone has to take a turn manning the desk each shift, and it's set up this way to give everyone a chance to relax, in theory. Doesn't always work that way, but I digress.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's an idea of what I'm working with. The desk I'm at has multiple monitors and computers; one for doing all my reports on, one that runs the phone call queue software for our general line, one that monitors alarms and is attached to a large machine that sounds periodically as it receives test signals from various accounts on campus - the computer takes the info from the machine and displays it in an easy to read format - and across the room is a bank of monitors displaying several cameras from all over the campus. I have 3 radios, one for each campus' caretaking/engineering/trades staff, and one for us security guards from both sites. We have our own dedicated channel as the other two have high traffic use and we need to be able to communicate efficiently in the event of an emergency. I have three phones - one \"emergency\" phone that's a direct line from panic phones and stations and has a dedicated \"emergency\" number, one attached to the queue system that's for general inquiries kind of thing, and a dedicated outside line that's separate entirely from the campus network. Basically there's one \"account\" with the telco that has multiple lines which handles everything on campus, and this one single phone that we have that's a completely separate account. And for a very good reason.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here I am, just after midnight, I'm sitting at the desk watching Netflix when the dedicated line rang. Never a good thing as this line is specifically for the telco that handles the lines coming in to our campus to call us when our main lines go down. Although every now and then someone will dial the wrong number and end up calling it. I answer the phone, it's the telco saying they've received alarms from both main campuses. Goody.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext step is for me to go through the S.O.P's and do test calls of a few numbers. I can't just dial any number, there's specific ones I have to dial, as each one is on a different node of our on campus network. The idea of these calls is to determine just how large the problem is, is it one node or the whole campus, as the telco only gets an error and nothing specific. And to ensure it works properly, I have to dial the full number as if I'm calling from an outside location, I can't just dial the last 4 numbers as that'll just route the call internally. Sure enough, every single one fails. I can't call outside numbers and nobody from outside can call in. Internal calls still work though so that's handy, means most of our emergency calls will still work. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow that I know there's a campus wide outage that affects both sites, I have to call out one of the campus telecommunication techs that manage our network with the big telco. First person on the call list is the main guy that manages it. I'll refer to him as Fred. The second number is for another tech in case I can't get a hold of Fred. However, neither of them are answering their phones. Lovely. So while I'm giving it a couple minutes to get my incident report started before trying again, my supervisor is in full micro manage mode and sticking his fingers in to \"assist\" with the situation. Except he's not listening to me. He decides to call the overnight engineers to see if they can call Fred. Even though it's not their responsibility at all, even though I'm handling it. He has it in his mind that Fred won't recognize the number I'm calling from and won't answer which is why he wants the engineers to try. Except with the phones being down, they can't call outside the internal network, which I try to explain to him but being the most junior on the crew - despite being there for a year - I'm sure you can imagine how well he listened. I try again to call Fred and the second tech while juggling the radio as the guards at the second site are trying to call the desk to confirm what I already know, and I get no answer again from Fred or the other tech. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinally I call Fred a third time and success! He answers! Except, oh crap. It's his son that answered, whoops. I asked him to go wake Fred as we have a situation we need him to fix. In the meantime my supervisor is again badgering, I tilt the phone away as I tell him it's ok, I have it under control, I got through this call.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll of a sudden out of the phone I hear a ton of screaming. Not high pitched I'm being murdered screaming, I'm talking horrified I-just-saw-something-I-can't-unsee screaming, lots of f bombs are being dropped, kids yelling at his dad it's the university calling, and I can hear in his voice he's horrified by what he walked in on. As I'm listening to this, I'm going red faced in my chair, biting my hand to stifle my horrified and shocked laughter, and my supervisor is giving me a WTF look. I just inadvertently interrupted happy fun times between Fred and I'm assuming his wife, and his poor son had the unfortunate luck to answer my call and walk in on them getting it on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext thing I hear is Fred on the phone, slightly high pitched voice from embarrassment, I quickly identify myself and tell him all the phone lines are down, he says he'll get on it and we hang up. I have no idea who wanted off the phone faster, me or him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPhones were fixed about an hour later, but I think there's going to be some changes to the call out list. Or at least new house rules for Fred's house.",

Our 'bottom' floor entrance is level with a park at the bottom of the hill. The exterior of the building includes gardens and a massive public staircase.\n\nLate one night, around 3 AM, my partner is patrolling the public staircase, and contacts me over the radio to tell me he's dealing with a man sleeping on a staircase landing, intoxicated. I am not busy so I head over to join him.\n\nWhen I get there, I find him conversing with a well dressed, but drunk black man, laying on his stomach with a can of beer beside him. My partner is telling the guy he has to get up, and the guy is saying no. Finally my partner says that if the guy refuses to get up, we'll trespass and arrest him. The man then agrees and stands up. We make him dump out the open beer, which he does. \n\nHe then pulls another beer out of his pocket, and shows it to me, and says \"this ones not open\"\n\nI go \"great. If you don't open it here you can keep it\"\n\n\"what pocket should I put it in\" he says\n\n\".... It doesn't matter man, just don't open it.\"\n\nHe then bows and says 'thank you\" and places the beer in his shirt pocket. We then ask him if he wants to go to the street, or to the park. He stands up straight and points towards the park. My partner says \"ok, we'll walk you down there\" and start to walk towards the stairs. Once we reach the top of the stairs, he stops and sticks his elbows straight out and says \"NO. escort me.\"\n\nMy partner and I give each other a 'wtf' look and then grab the guys arms in escort position, and walk him down the stairs.\n\nOn the way down, we have a very strange yet hilarious conversation with the man. He calls himself 'black jesus' and asks us if we would rather go to berlin or cameroon. My partner says \"I guess I would like to see berlin.\" to which the man responds \"no. I hate berlin. Lets change the subject\"\n\nHe then starts telling us about how during wwII the king of scotland had to flee, and couldn't return or he would be killed to prevent him from returning to the throne. he said the king went into hiding in south africa, and bore one son. \n\nAt this point in the conversation we get to the park and we're off our property, so we let him go. With his back turned to us, he says \"and do you know what that son's name is\"\n\nI go \"no, what was it?\"\n\nhe then turns dramatically, holds his head up high, and says \"you're lookin at him\"\n\nHe then cracks open his beer, bows (dumping out most of the can) and walks away.",

        "text": "As I mentioned in [my last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/4y4i2c/its_okay_i_already_took_my_underwear_off/), I'm a security officer at a hospital. Some of you share this depressing profession, so you may know that every hospital comes up with it's own set of goofy rules for what security officers can and can't do when interacting with patients, and how much interaction we actually have with them at all. Some security officers get lucky and really don't have to deal with them very much, while others get screwed over and have to find a way to deal with patients face-to-face on a regular basis with a \"no hands\" policy. \n\nMy hospital falls into the middle ground on this: We spend large amounts of time directly babysitting psych patients, drug addicts and alcoholics. However, we *DO NOT* have any policy preventing us from using physical force, so we gladly throw people around and  restrain them to their beds if necessary. (I've seen more than a few instances where overly-violent security guards got carried away, but that is another story!)\n\nEven after several years of this chaos, encountering many \"interesting\" characters, my favorite one by far is still head and shoulders above any of the others: **\"Zyprexa the Porn Star\"**\n\nShe was a 30-something white female meth-head. Unlike a lot of the meth heads, she was not physically violent or aggressive. In fact, she was quite friendly and mostly just wanted to talk. And she talked *a lot*! She literally never shut up and wouldn't stop talking under any circumstances. She would talk *AT* anyone whom she could see. If there was any obstacle in between the person she was talking *at* and herself (such as a closed door or window) she would simply talk *louder* in order to be certain that the person could hear her. \n\nNaturally, the medical staff (which hates having to deal with even the polite non-meth-using patients) grew tired of her antics in short order and dumped her on security for us to deal with her. We watched her for a few hours and every security guard who watched her has their own story of the absolutely insane things she said while they were watching her. \n\nDuring the *single hour* that I watched her, I remember her saying the following things:\n\n1. She said that \"the KGB and the lizard people\" were conspiring to wipe out the inhabitants of underground tunnels. \n\n2. She said that the U.S. Government was involved in a conspiracy to destroy \"the culture of the native american wind talkers\" with radiation poisoning. \n\n3. She asked me to being her a \"cup of hydraulic acid tea\" and \"a bowl of methamphetamines\" because we were \"in the science lab\" as she put it.\n\n4. She gave a 20-minute lecture on [the sexual benefits of kegels](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a273/kegels-enhance-sex/) which she claimed allowed her to \"suck dick with your ass!\"\n\n5. While giving her kegel speech, she watched an episode of Family Feud on the television in her hospital room, during which time she repeatedly claimed that she saw the contestants on the show doing kegels. \n\nFinally, when they came to take her away to the psych department (where security luckily doesn't have to deal with the patients unless they become violent), they told her that [Zyprexa](https://www.drugs.com/zyprexa.html) was the same of the medication they wanted to give her.\n\nAs soon as they said the name of the medication, she blurted out: \"Zyprexa!? Well, thats going to be my new porn star name!\"\n\nHence how she earned her nickname. \n\nAlso, whenever I tell this story, someone inevitably asks if she was actually attractive enough to be a porn star. The answer is: She might have been once, *before* using meth for ten years!",

I have a tale from the customer from earlier in the day from this too).\n\nAnyways unless I'm mixing memories it was me, my girlfriend, my best friend's girlfriend, and her best friend who met up with one of my friends, his girlfriend, another of my friends, and his girlfriend, and one of our female friends.\n\nAnyways, for some reason we decided to play tag in the underground parkinglot which was barely used; we were being respectful of the cars and people trying to get in/out of the shopping mall. No real big deal, kids being kids, right? Tell them to leave and move and that's that. Which we were, and did. Now, the security guards had told us we were banned from the mall for a day. Understandable, we made no argument about it, we all started to go home.\n\nHere's the thing: The parking garage we were at was on the opposite side of the mall, including the parking lot which surrounded it in every direction. So as soon as we were off the property we were like \"Shit\", but it was no big deal, we were young and could walk around it.\n\nHere comes the security bitch from hell, she was one of the ones who had kicked us out, we were being careful to try and stay off anythingthing that might be considered \"mall property\", and kept taunting us to come to her car (on mall property) because \"she couldnt hear us\". Me being one of the older and smarter ones told us all to keep walking, ignoring her, so she turned her attention on me specifically.\n\nI don't remember the exact details but I basically just insulted her, threw insults at her, and told her to step off mall grounds so I could press assault charges if she touched me. My insults were not mean other than \"Oh, belitting kids in your safe 'I can call the cops' zone must make you feel so powerful.\"\n\nI wasn't profane, I wasn't aggressive and only responded to her. She gave up after a while when she realised we literally wouldn't let her get her off on cuffing a kid for breaking a day ban on a mall even when she called us over to the car to talk I realised it was a trap.\n\nSometimes people really will respect your rules and you don't have to harass them into breaking their rules and I doubt she learned anything but it felt nice to put her abuse of power in it's place.\n\nIf I was just a little smarter I would have called 911 to sort it out and let my friends go on their way (my friend lived beside my girlfriend; actually introduced us) and waited for the cops to tell the bitch she had no legal right to harass teenagers for walking around the mall when they had been only been banned for a day (which I doubt she had the power to even do)\n\nTLDR; We exited peacefully and without fuss; we were harassed",

Its been extremely quiet, as we'd been allotted 4 hours of shift time to simply take pictures of cars out in the street, a task that took at most 20 minutes... 3 hours of trying to stay busy and failing later, I was finishing up my paperwork and getting ready to head back to dispatch when I heard an engine start around the corner from me. Normally this would not catch my attention, except that the vehicle was violently thrown into gear as soon as the engine turned over, and the sound of squealing tires soon followed. This made me look up and pay some attention, but it was the sound of impact between vehicles that really woke me from my stupor. As I scrambled for radio and phone alike, while starting my vehicle and racing towards the corner, the volume of noise got a lot worse, as the sounds of peeling tires, flying gravel, and multiple additional vehicle impacts reached me. As I rounded the corner, my headlights illuminated a real mess.\n\nGravel and patches of suburban sod were flung all across the street, along with chunks of concrete and the skewed angles of 3 cars that had now been knocked out of their driveways. In the distance, I finally caught sight of the white SUV, its nose buried in a hole in a brick wall, invading some poor persons living room. As I approached with wide eyes in my Crown Victoria, the driver slammed the gas yet again, flinging gravel everywhere. As as I dropped into info-relaying mode to the Police Department dispatch, the driver got out of the totalled wreck and began to punch and kick his vehicle as though it had stolen his girlfriend.\n\nAfter about a minute, he saw my patrol vehicle, which our company had decided to try to make look as much as a police car as possible, with black paint job, light bar, the works. He approached cautiously, and I rolled down the window with the police dispatcher still listening through the phone in my hand. He walked to about 5 feet away, squinting as he examined my car. Slowly he began to slur out a word....\"Coooop?\"\n\n\"I'm no cop, man.\" I informed him with probably too big a grin on my face. He was apparently comforted by this, since the next phrase out of his mouth was \"Hey maaan, do you wanna get high?\" I'm normally pretty quick on my feet, but that one had me grasping for words for a moment. Before I could formulate a proper response, he continued, \"If you can get me to 128th Street...\" I glanced at the nearest street sign. Sure enough, he was asking for a ride for the 300 feet to get back to the house whose driveway he just peeled out from. I heard a distant squeak, and determined after a confused moment that it was the sound of the small town police dispatcher, laughing uproariously in the phone still in my hand. My scatterbrained friend stared at it for a moment before the entirety of the small town's police force appeared on the once quiet street.\n\nHalf an hour of paperwork later, it was hard to keep a straight face as every cop on the scene, as well as the paramedics taking the fellow out on the stretcher, kept repeating to each other, \"Hey maaaan, wanna get high?!\"",

        "text": "Alright word of warning. Story contains mental illness and/or drugs so on one hand it's sad and depressing and I genuinely feel bad for the guy but on the other it was pretty fucking funny/spooky and I need to share it. \n\n\nI was more than halfway through my shift and it was closing in on 2am when I glanced behind me as I was crossing a car park on my property. Now I've been super sick since Friday with the flu or something and my hearing is all fucked and my brain is mush but getting cover on my site is hard due to the size of it. \n\n\nSO. When I first saw a pale blur sprint from the shadowey alleyway across the street carrying a stick like it was a sword and he was a brave highland warrior in Braveheart off preparing to fuck up the English my first thought was \"Alright I guess I'm hallucinating now.\" \n\n\nTurning, I see him appear from behind a building in my property (plsno) and run into the car park so I now knew I wasn't hallucinating and was wondering what the fuck I'm going to do when Canada's William Wallace comes at me with his stick. \n\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I meant it to sound commanding and affirmative but what actually came out was muffled by my croaky throat and decidedly high pitched at the \"^m^^e^^^e?\" with my growing confusion. \n\n\nInstead of stopping, the man, who I can now see is probably in his 30's, is shirtless and wearing 3/4 length shorts instead runs at, then scales and bounces over - with such enthusiasm and gusto that I still can't believe it - a gateway that's EASILY 8-9ft tall and topped with double strands of barbed wire. No - the wire did not slow him. \n\n\nSo looks like I'm calling 911. He's now trespassing in an area where he could kill himself quite easily or literally cause explosions.\n\n\nI walk to the gate as I'm calling and I see him climbing up a ladder that just has an inspection area and no alternative exits at the top. He jerks his head around, turns around and scrambles down the ladder before SPRINTING off away from me towards a small shack. Now the shack has the fence that's connected to the gate he cleared running behind it, and the space between them isn't enough for an average build guy to stand facing the back corner, you would have to shimmy in sideways.\n\n\nNot this guy.\n\n\nHe sprints straight in, shirtless, bouncing into the dark, THORNY BUSHED corner and vanishes from sight. \n\n\nI'm personally quite happy with this as I wait for the police because where he is isn't immediately dangerous. I back up so I have a 180 degree view of that shack, and the street further down the block because if he clears the exterior fence I don't want him coming up behind me.\n\n\nAbout 5 minutes or so later I spot him down the street nearly a full block away, sprinting across to the side he came from originally and into another property of mine, which royally fucks me because I'm waiting for the cops so I'm standing there thinking pls don't break anything.\n\n\nThe amazing part about this is that between the shack and where he reappeared he would have either had to clear three wire topped fences of similar heights to the gateway OR one fence followed by a sprint through woods filled with wet muddy holes, ditches, slopes and thick thorny bushes. \n\n\nI alter my position so I have a 180 of the street behind me now and I see him sprinting along the rear of the car park opposite me (still my property) so the guy ends up back roughly where he first appeared, sees me, and darts into a dark gap between two buildings. \n\n\nAfter this I move to where I can see what SHOULD be his exit point only for him to reappear a half block further away and sprint across the street into a dark alleyway. \n\n\nThat was the last I saw of him.\n\n\nShortly after this I saw a passerby heading in his direction and stopped him to warn him and before I'd got further than \"there's a guy running arou-\" the passerby asks \"WAS HE SHIRTLESS?\"\n\n\nTurns out the dude had sprinted up to this guy after midnight and demanded to know if \"HE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM?????\"\n\n\nI've received no update from the cops(other than meeting with them and seeing them searching) as of yet but left a voicemail and will hopefully hear that the guy was found safely but goddamn was there something highly entertaining about a shirtless dude sprinting around full power at 2am. \n\n\nYes I absolutely freaked out at every dark corner after that. ",

        "text": "So, since some folks are reading these without reading the others first... I worked security at a military installation that housed a service academy for about 5 years, starting in 2010. I don't do it anymore, but i still work for the gov at another facility, doing background checks now. All clear?\n\nLike many military bases, this installation had quite a large amount of wooded area surrounding it, and seeing wildlife was very common. However, this was kind of an island of green in an otherwise quite populated area, and quite a few of my co-workers hailed from a very large city that was nearby, and were not used to seeing wildife on that level. I'm from MS, though, so I usually didnt think much of it to see wildlife.\n\nOne night, I was working the facility's rear gate, which was DoD (department of defense) use only, and was pretty remote for the standards of this base. There was a housing area nearby, so it wasn't uncommon to see raccoons at night, and occasionally deer. Also, a flock of about 25 turkeys tended to roost near there. Anyway, I had last rotation to the overwatch booth that night, which was a few hundred yards or so inside the gate, near our deployable barricades. It was spring, and the night had a cool but comfortable breeze, so I had the doors of the booth open to enjoy the fresh air, and had a foot propped up on the desk in the booth, just waiting on shift change. All of the sudden, I felt something moving around my other foot, like a cat rubbing against my leg. looked down, ohshitohshitoshit... saw that unmistakable white stripes on a black back of a skunk just chilling in the damn booth. I think my ass bit a chunk out of the seat tightening up. Seemed like it took him 15 minutes (was prolly more like 3-5 minutes) before the skunk finally decided to wander out the other door of the booth and into the woods. Told my LT when we got back to the arms room that I would have shot it if it had sprayed me and justified it as retaliation for a biological warfare attack. Dunno how I avoided getting sprayed there.\n\nAnother night at that gate, a young raccoon we had named 'nugget' came up to the booth at the gate and started eating from the trashcan. Most of the guys were used to seeing the 'coons, we even had some of them tame enough to hand feed, but this night the guy I was working with was an MP who grew up in boston or maybe baltimore. Started with a B, I dont remember. Anyway, he was new there, and I guess had not ever been around many animals, especially wild ones. He was acting like there was some kind of monster in the trash can, shut himself in the booth and locked the door with me outside. I was just like dude, it's a baby raccoon. Told the MP to give me one of his string cheese things he had in his bag, and hand fed the coon. MP thought I was nuts, and he just stayed shut up in the booth watching me.\n\nAnother night, I had signed up to work some OT late into the night shift at an internal guard post protecting the central area of the base. The HMFIC of the post quarters was just inside this central area, and the post maintained a garden behind his quarters. Around 0130, I heard hooves walking up the road, and 4 bucks came walking up, jumped the vehicle barrier, and strolled into the garden to eat. It was 2 nice size 6pt's, an 8pt that was prolly a 130-140 class buck, and a 12pt that had split brow tines and was prolly a 180 class buck. I had my pistol upholstered, but thought it through. I knew if I shot I would have been fired, but if they let me keep the rack, any job I applied for back home would have understood. That was a trophy whitetail. They wouldn't have let me keep it.\n\nOne of the guys had a bear keep him in the overwatch booth at another gate one afternoon. That radio call to delay rotation due to a bear trying to get into the booth was pretty funny, Patrol had to come out and use lights/sirens to scare it off. Had another nuisance bear that had to be relocated because it kept dumpster diving in a housing area.\n\nAnyway....  Here's a pic of a [fox](http://i.imgur.com/UOLBfIs.jpg) one of my co-workers took, and the flock of [turkeys](http://i.imgur.com/WDV0VGf.jpg) I took. Pretty sure we named that fox 'Lefty', but I cant remember why. That's all I got as far as wildlife goes.",

I worked security at a military installation that housed a service academy for about 5 years, starting in 2010. I don't do it anymore, but i still work for the gov at another facility, doing background checks now. All clear?\n\nSince this was a service academy, there were several D1 sports teams for the future leaders to be involved with. Games involving football, baseball, basketball, and hockey always included a large influx of spectators, just like they would at any other D1 school, but because this was also an active military base in wartime, it always caused a headache for security, and access was likely much different than your typical college environment. I know it was much different than where I went to school. Anyway, one of the issues we had was people bringing in RVs and campers to stay for the events. This was allowed for certain people, boosters, VIP's, etc. However, because someone in an RV had severely damaged his vehicle and the search area cover at one of the gates previously (and then attempted to blame the incident on the installation rather than his own driving), the decision was made to force ALL RV's and campers to utilize the commercial vehicle gate, rather than trying to fit through the other gates that were designed for normal vehicular traffic. Most folks had no problem with this, and would proceed there for entrance as instructed, once given directions. \n\nOther folks thought they were too important for all that and didn't really like being told they couldn't come through whatever gate they happened to pull up to on the day of the event. This is about one such individual.\n\nNow, I don't really follow baseball. Where I come from, football is the sport everyone follows, and college ball is the flavor of choice (SEC SEC SEC), but I at least know who some of the big names in baseball are, and kinda what they look like, so when Joe Girardi pulled up to the gate I was working, I knew who he was. However, the important thing for me was that he was in an RV, and as stated, He couldn't bring that RV through that gate. I tried to give him directions to that gate, no dice.\n\nJG: \"Major so and so told me to come to this gate, so I'm going through THIS gate.\"\n\nme: \"Well sir, that major doesn't outrank the Col that made the decision to not allow large vehicles through this gate, and even if that policy was not in place, this RV will not fit through this gate without tearing it up\"\n\nJG: \"do you not know who I am?\"\n\nme: \"yes sir, well aware of who you are\"\n\nJG: \"so what, you just aren't a fan and trying to use this opportunity to piss me off\"\n\nme: \"no sir, i don't really follow baseball at all, this is entirely about the vehicle you are in, and the fact that it wont fit through this gate.\"\n\nJG: \"that's bullshit, I'm calling major so and so to come here and sort this out, he'll deal with you\"\n\nme: \"OK sir, whatever.\"\n\nWell, he called this major, took the major a while to get there due to traffic with the event, but he eventually got there, and comes up to me asking \"whyinthehell are you denying access to Joe Girardi??\" I explained to major so and so that I was not telling him he couldnt come on the post, just that he couldnt use this gate because he was in an RV, said RV would not fit through this gate, and Colonel **** had issued a policy that all RV's were to use the commercial gate. The major asked me why didnt I explain that to JG. I face-palmed and said thats what I'd been trying to do for the last 20 minutes. the major told JG exactly what I had been trying to explain to him, and like magic, he suddenly understood.\n\nI guess maybe he just wanted to be able to follow someone to that gate instead of being told how to get there, but didn't want to make it seem like he was bad at following directions? Or maybe he thought my accent was Boston and not deep south. IDK. He got turned around and out of my hair though, and I became less of a Yankee's fan than I already was. Some people, I tell ya... My co-worker that had to search his RV told me it was a really nice camper though, so I guess there's that.\n\ntl;dr: Joe Girardi thought me telling him to use a different gate was the same thing as telling him he couldn't come on the installation. I was just trying to direct him where he could go to get on the installation without tearing his camper up.",

I worked security at a military installation that housed a service academy for about 5 years, starting in 2010. I don't do it anymore, but i still work for the gov at another facility, doing background checks now. All clear?\n\nThe facility I worked at was very popular with tourists. Just outside one of the gates was a visitor center and a museum. There was a company contracted through the visitor center that had guided tours that people could take for a fee, but often, people would just try to drive onto the facility on their own. That was allowed during certain hours, as long as the vehicle was properly searched and cleared.\n\nHowever, the big problem with tourists, is that tourists like to take pictures. Pictures are not allowed of security/military operations for obvious reasons, and some people don't like being told no. After a year or two working there, I got tired of having to argue with people about deleting their pictures, and especially with having to try and decipher chinese or sanskrit or whatever language the camera menu was in, so I started carrying the magnet from an old speaker in my pocket to take out on folks that argued with me. It usually did a pretty good job of wiping the camera's memory. Do what I say, and you just lose the pictures you weren't supposed to take. Argue, and you're gonna need to send your camera in to be re-formatted.\n\nThis one day, I notice a group of about 4 tourists taking pictures of the gate, so I wave them over and tell them that pictures of security operations are not allowed, and to delete the photos. The guys of the group immediately do so, but the woman? Oh no, she starts saying I cant make her do that, because there are no signs saying she can't. Of course, I explain to her \"ma'am, I'm here to tell you that you can't. There's no sign because security is here, and I am security.\" she keeps going on and on about how I don't have the authority to do that, while I'm trying to tell her calmly, \"ma'am, photography of security operations on military installations are never allowed no matter where you are, please delete the photos.\" Well, she wouldn't quit arguing, and finally just started screaming \"you don't have the authority!\" over and over until i just broke and yelled back, saying \"BITCH I got a gun, that's all the authority I need! Gimme that damn camera!\" And the menu was in a language I couldn't read, so she got the magnet. \"Here you are ma'am, you'll have to send that back to kodak to get it to work again.\"\n\nI got chewed out a bit for that one. Not for using the magnet, but yelling at her that I had a gun. I guess that part was a bit threatening. I was just trying to let her know that I did have the authority to tell her not to take pictures in the simplest way possible.\n\nMost folks went ahead and deleted their pictures when I told them to do so. I mean, I'm 6'4\", about 225 at the the time (gained a bit at the desk job now). I didn't have to use the magnet very often.\n\nTl;dr: used a magnet to wipe a woman's camera because she didn't think i had the authority to tell her she couldn't take pictures. I did have that authority.",

        "text": "so im going to pre-empt this story by saying that i grew up in MS, and i think i had been on a toll road maybe twice before i took the security job i worked and moved across the country for it. the state where the job was located, toll roads were everywhere. that information is important, as this story is not quite as funny as it is without knowing that.\n\nanyway, i had been on the job maybe 4-6 months at this point, and i was working one of the gates. I had just rotated up to an overwatch position that was located adjacent to the deployable vehicle barricades when i got a call on the radio about a vehicle that had run the gate. so i deployed the barricade, grabbed the shotgun, and stepped out when the vehicle approached with the shotgun trained on the driver, who happened to be an older guy, prolly in his 50's or 60's with his wife. I asked them what they were doing...\n\nold dude: \"we were just trying to get to the **** bridge (a toll bridge) to go across the river!\"\n\nme: \"why didnt you stop at the security check point back there?\" \n\nod: \"we thought it was the toll booth\"\n\nme: \"well why didnt you stop to pay the toll?\"\n\nod, pointing at his windshield, \"I've got an easy pass\"\n\nme \"wtf is an easy pass?\"\n\nand then the guy looks at me like i'm retarded, when he's the one that just tried to run the gate thinking it was the toll booth at the bridge. i had the 12 gauge pointed at this guy the whole time. i put the gun back in the booth and told him he was a few miles off, gave him directions and had him turn around. should have asked him when was the last time he went through a toll booth where the operators were standing outside the booths with badges and gun on their hips, but i was still unfamiliar with how toll booths operated at that point. thats what the guys who were hired locally said anyway, after they got done laughing at me for not knowing what an easy pass was.\n\ntl;dr: pointed a shotgun at a guy and he taught me about the toll system of the state i had just moved to in return.",

        "text": "I was working at a city-owned community centre, which was being rented for a social gathering of the turkish/romanian variety. Alcohol was being served, so as per building rules guards had to be hired by the organizers. One building staff member was also present.  No children were allowed in the main hall (10-15 children were brought, and were basically confined to a small hallway... with no babysitter...). I was posted at the front door giving out smoke tickets so people could get back in, we locked the doors fairly early. The other guard, we'll call him Mark, was at the doors to the main hall.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe were dropped off by the owner of our company, who was buddies with the organizer. Owner gave VERY explicit instructions to Mark that he can NOT leave his post to have a smoke without letting me know, and MUST smoke out front so I can get him if shit happens.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAbout halfway through the 4 shift of surviving rampaging children, a muscular man in an orange shirt attempted to leave with two beers. Where the fuck was Mark and why did this man even get to me. I told him he couldn't leave with the beers, and he threw them on the ground and started yelling at me. I told him to calm down or he'd be thrown out, and then the organizer got involved. \"oh sorry, he's my friend, blah blah i'll take responsibility blah blah\". The problem of course is that the organizer is friends with the damned owner, so I let the man back in. Just remember him as Orange shirt.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust after midnight, in the final hour, I'm using the smoke tickets to play \"the quiet game\" with the children. Whomever stays quiet the longest each round gets one. Maintained my sanity for a bit. Then I hear some yelling, look down the hall, and see two men running towards me waving their hands around and shouting in some language. Once again, where the fuck is Mark. I follow them into the main hall and find Orange Shirt being held up against a wall by about a dozen people, ranging from just holding him to shaking their finger in his face to grabbing his fucking jaw and screaming at him. I move in, get a hand on his shoulder to get his attention, and do my job: \"You need to leave now\". \n\nHis jaw is then grabbed by some woman. I start peeling people away from the group that are of the finger wagging and jaw grabbing variety, leaving four men holding him. I tell them all he needs to be moved towards the exit, and we start corralling him. The building staff are present and tell him he needs to leave, doing her job. Orange Shirt rips off his shirt hogan style and throws it on the ground, picks it up and eventually slams his way out the front doors, with the four men following him outside.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt some point, Mark showed up and was following me around. I couldn't pinpoint when he showed up in my report, but I know that when I noticed him I dismissed him as completely fucking useless and just handled it myself. Once we were outside I turned to him and asked the question. \n\n\"Where the fuck were you?\"\n\n\"Having a smoke.\" \n\n\"Where?\" \n\n\"Out back with the organizer\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen I hear a crash, look inside, and see a man bleeding from a head wound that just pushed someone into the vending machine. FFS... I tell Mark to stay at the door and to NOT let Orange Shirt back in, and go inside. I paused in the lobby, assessed everything, then said fuck it and called the police. I now have two violent men and I can't deal with them both at the same time. I got my directions wrong to dispatch, but I did some hand talking with the building staff and they confirmed they were already talking to police. Great. I let the dispatcher know someone else is talking to them and hang up. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI get the bleeding man to sit down inside and calm him down. Building staff ask him to leave, and I tell her no, he isn't going outside (because Orange shirt and this guy likely fought). Some woman casually walks up to the man and dumps a bottle of water over his head and begins finger wagging and shouting. The man tries to stand and I gently hold him back, telling the woman to get out.\n\nPolice arrive, and I call my supervisor and tell him to get down here NOW. I step outside the front doors to find Building Staff locked in a conversation with another woman; the woman was the girlfriend of Orange Shirt, and was trying to apologize for him and tell building staff he wasn't coming back. Building staff was... \"trapped\" in her training and kept repeating \"you need to leave\", oblivious to the fact that the woman was TELLING HER that they were leaving. I had to step between the two of them before that got out of hand, as the woman was getting very aggravated with staff.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy supervisor shows up, as do city security, since it's their building. Give my statement to city security, and I tell my supervisor about the lack of presence from Mark along with the full events. Supervisor instructs us both to have a full occurrence report to him by the end of the day Monday. I finished mine before I went to sleep. Mark never wrote one and was terminated on Tuesday.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh, the cause of the fight? Police didn't do a damned thing except book Orange Shirt and the guy with the bloody head. No questions to anyone. I walked in and asked one of the clean-up guys wtf happened. You know how you reach around someone and tap them on the shoulder and make them look away from you? Well, same thing here, except instead of a tap it was a full slap to the side of the head of Orange Shirt by someone walking by. Orange Shirt turned and slugged the guy sitting beside him, and the culprit booked it out an emergency exit.",

        "text": "I've worked hospital security for about four years now. 90% of the job is babysitting psych patients in the emergency department, because the medical staff doesn't want to deal with them. A lot of the psych patients are meth heads, homeless people and general purpose weridos. So naturally, I have a lot of stories.\n\nHowever, I think the best story is actually a rare one which happened outside the building while I was on patrol. \n\nOn one side of our campus (there are two hospitals and several smaller out-patient buildings) there is a public transportation depot with both trains and busses. We get a lot of people from public transport wandering onto our property, usually not for the right reasons. \n\nOne night, I'm driving the security vehicle around the parking lots. I get a call from dispatch over the radio that they saw someone on security cameras trying to get into the hospital on the side of the property adjacent to the public transportation depot. The guy was looking in the windows and trying to open random locked doors. Then they lost track of him and can't find him anymore.\n\nI drive over there and pretty shortly I see the guy, looking in a set of windows. I roll down a window and call him over to the car.\n\nConversation goes like this:\n\nMe: \"Hey, you looking for something I can help you find?\"\n\nGuy: \"Uh, no. Not anymore. I was just looking for a bathroom.\"\n\nMe: \"Are you sick? Do you need to go to the emergency department?\" (I ask this, because if people are on property at night and aren't asking to be seen as patients in emergency, we can kick them off the property.)\n\nGuy: \"No, that's okay. I already shit myself and took my underwear off!\"\n\nMe: \"Uh... okay...?\"\n\nGuy: \"I'm just waiting for my ride to come get me now.\"\n\nMe: \"...okay...\"\n\nI was pretty stunned that someone would just put it that bluntly. He shit himself. Then took off his underwear. And then some security guard confronts him and he just outright admits all of this, in a very casual way, as if it wasn't a big deal at all. Just another normal day, shitting yourself and ditching your shitty underwear somewhere. \n\nI left him alone to wait for his ride and sure enough someone came and picked him up.\n\nI told the other security guards about this encounter later and the first thing someone said was: \"Well, did you ask him where he put his underwear!?\" Sorry, I didn't think to ask that when some guy just told me he shit himself!\n\nMonths later some other security guard was telling a story about how he was on a foot patrol in that same area, saw an odd spot in the rock bed and moved the rocks to see what was under them. Some shit-stained underwear, of course! So that mystery was eventually solved.",

        "text": "like i said in my last post, i have a bunch of these, so i think i'll post one or two a week until i get tired of it or run out. this one has to do with one of the busiest nights i can remember working. \n\nI usually worked swings when i did security. im a single dude, no kids, no family close by, so i liked the freedom to stay out late after work and get up at the crack of noon and still make it in to work on time. also gave me time to moonlight as a bouncer occasionally, and the OT opportunities, especially staying late into the night shift were pretty dependable. the down side to swings where i worked was that, every now and then, the perfect shitstorm of events on the installation would leave us overwhelmed. \n\nthis particular night, there was a dance going on for the students, an indoor track meet, a hockey game, a show at the theater on post, and i think maybe a dive meet or gymnastics or something. there was just a huge influx of traffic on nights like these, and searching cars at the gates takes time. the MP's would assist when they could, but couldnt stay the whole time. basically, from 1400 when i got on post to around 1900 or so, we were never less than prolly 15-20 cars deep, and were often so deep that we couldnt see the end of the line of cars. thankfully, we didnt run into any issues with the inbounds, and about 30 minutes after the traffic died down, i mentioned to the new guard that it should be slow for the rest of the night now that everyone was in.\n\nwrong. wrong wrong.\n\nno sooner than those words left my mouth we get an alert on the radios that there was an amber alert, stop all outbound to look for a missing kid. dammit boy. got saved by the second outbound vehicle though. guy pulls up, car absolutely reeks of weed. normally i wouldnt care, but the guy had a lit blunt just cas sittin on his knee. i ask him whats in the wrapper, and he just puts it in the center console and says what wrapper. im like dude, i aint a storm trooper, them jedi mind tricks dont work on me. \n\ncalled up the desk, and the guy working the desk that night was a big ol boy from georgia, and he sounded more country than me, and i grew up in MS. any way, i tell him that i got a car that smells very strongly of an illicit substance, and he replies back \"oh it stanky, huh? aiiight i get somebody o'erder\" and hangs up. the MP support shows up, as well as the local PD because this gate happens to be on state jurisdiction instead of federal due to poor surveying. when they pull up, they are parking maybe 25-30 meters from the suspect vehicle, and said they could smell it from there. \n\nThe local asks the MP and me if its ok if he can just make him give him something and let him go, and we were just like, hey, you got the jurisdiction, you make the call. So after a short conversation, the local tells the guy \"look, i know you've got something in here, so just give it up, and we'll all get on our way, dont make me look for it\", and the suspect of course tries telling him he doesnt have anything either. so they toss the car, find two and a half ounces in the guy's underwear (already broke up into baggies) and a brick in the trunk. couldnt find the blunt i saw, but they found it's guts in the back seat. they hit the guy with felony possession with intent to distribute, felony paraphernalia, and felony introduction of a controlled substance to a secure environment. y'all working security might look into that last one, not every state has it, and the intent of the law is to add penalties to folks bringing drugs into prisons, but the wording makes it apply to alot of secure facilities. sad part is, the guy wouldnt have even gotten a ticket if he would have given up a baggie or two to the cop.\n\nI'll do a short one about the first time i had to draw down on someone later this week.\n\ntl;dr: dont ever say things ought to be relaxed for the rest of the shift or murphy'll bone ya.",

        "text": "During my early 20's, while I was more hotblooded and stupid than I am now, one of my first semi \"real\" jobs was working security at a strip club.  This was years before I realized that law enforcement might be a career path for me.  I never would've guessed that I'd end up working for a police department.\n\nMy coworkers mostly consisted of a bunch of guys just like me, who loved to fight almost as much as they loved the girls.  Unfortunately, I almost got into some trouble because of my temper.\n\nIt was about three in the afternoon and I was making my rounds, keeping an eye on the patrons and the entertainers strewn about the floor.  On the main stage, Lyla was doing her thing, gyrating around the pole and taking her bra off.\n\nSuddenly, a blur of movement caught my eye.  I turned and saw a drunken patron clambering up onto the stage and staggering towards Lyla.  I began sprinting toward the stage while radioing others for help.\n\nWe snatched up Mr. Grabby-Grabby and dragged him outside, all the while he swore up and down that Lyla was making eyes at him, she wanted him, yadda yadda.  Once we reached the door, we pushed him out where he tumbled and fell onto the sidewalk, dazed.\n\nI turned to the guys that'd helped me and told them I could handle it from here.  They returned inside and I took up a post in front of the door, barring him from re-entry.\n\nSlowly, yet deliberately, the intoxicated man repeatedly protested his newfound situation, first pleading, then threatening me to return him to Lyla.  Nope. Nope. Nope.  I'm not a very big guy (about 5'10,\" 160lbs) but this guy was even smaller and had imbibed far too much to really handle himself properly.  My brain took none of this into account.\n\nJust as I was considering whether or not to physically encourage him to leave the area, the club's general manager, Mr. Green, came out to have a smoke.  Damn.  I don't wanna get in trouble.\n\nAs Mr. Green silently looked on, the drunken man pulled his phone from his pocket and began recording me, all the while hurling more verbal abuse.  Unsure of what to do, I turned to Mr. Green.\n\n\"Sir, permission to hit him?\"\n\"No.\"\n\nDammit.\n\nAs the man (and his rancid breath) staggered closer and closer, he pushed his phone right up to my face, inches away.  Instinctively, I smacked the phone out of his hands.  It clattered to the concrete so hard the case popped off and battery flew out.\n\n\"HEY!\" Mr. Green looked at me incredulously.  I threw up my hands in protest.  \"I didn't hit him!\"\n\nMr. Green eyed me for a moment and took a drag from his cigarette, then shrugged as if to say \"Hm.  Fair enough.\"\n\nThe drunk stared at the pieces of his phone, then at me, and with a garbled attempt at a war-cry, threw a wild haymaker at me.\n\nI threw up my arm instictively, felt his arm connect, then promptly slugged him across his jaw.  The featherweight crumpled to the ground.\n\n\"HEY!!!\" Mr. Green's eyes were bulging.  I panicked.  \"It was self defense!!\"  He sighed and rubbed his temple.\n\nWhoop whoop whoop!  Just then, a passing police cruiser screeched to a halt, having seen only the tail-end of the altercation.  Two police officers hopped out and started beelining towards me.  \"Hey you!\" said the first one, \"Get over here NOW!\"\n\nMr. Green stepped between me and the approaching cops.  \"Get inside the club.\"\n\nI did as Mr. Green said.  To this day, I'm still not sure if that was the right choice.\n\nI'd heard rumors from other older employees at the club that Mr. Green was a powerful man, with connections to the police department's upper brass.  This was the moment of truth.  I thought I was done.  I'm gonna go to jail.\n\nHeart racing, I peered through one of the tinted windows of the club to see what was happening.  The drunk was motionless and the cops were seething, pointing at the door I was hiding behind as Mr. Green calmly spoke to them.\n\nThe next thing I knew, Mr. Green was lighting a new cigarette and laughing it up with the cops, chattering happily with them about who-knows-what.  I was in shock.  The rumors were true!\n\nWith a firm handshake each, Mr. Green waved off the cops and they started back to their patrol car just as the belligerent drunk began to regain consciousness.\n\nIncredibly, and much to my amusement, he picked up the pieces of his phone, reassembled it, turned it back on-- then staggered up to the cops, recording them and screaming obscenities.\n\nHe pushed his phone right up to one of the cop's face.  The cop glanced at his partner-- then smacked the phone out of his hand.\n\nOnce again, the phone shattered into pieces, and once again, the man howled and threw a wild haymaker.  The cops took him down, cuffed him up and shoved him into the back of the patrol car before speeding off.  I was overwhelmed.  What. Just. Happened??\n\nMr. Green flipped his half-finished cigarette into the street and strolled back inside where I was standing, mouth agape.  As he glided past, he casually turned to me.\n\n\"I think Vanessa is leaving soon.  Can you escort her to her car?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"",

        "text": "so, a few years ago, i took a job working security a military installation, and to boot, it was one of the academies. i worked there for almost 5 years before taking another gov security job elsewhere. I do background investigations now, but I have a treasure trove of stories from my time there. this one is from my last week working there.\n\ni will preface by saying that i tended to get in trouble a bit because i was a smart ass, had a short temper, but also followed the rules to the letter. in other words, my co-workers loved me, my superiors tended to hate me but usually couldnt do anything about it. (perk of being a gov employee)\n\nanyway, on this day, it was a week before graduation, so we were fairly busy. after 1700, the post was closed to tourists, so you need a military ID or valid destination to enter. around 1930, a mid 90's ford aerostar pulls up to the gate with 4 occupants of an Asiatic descent, only the driver produced ID, which was his driver's license for the state. I asked for the other occupant's identification, and the purpose of their visit. the passenger in the front seat, who appeared to be mid-eighties, said that I didnt need their ID's as they were just going to take pictures at a spot on post that was very popular with tourists. so of course, I informed him that I would need to see ID to allow entry, but that if their ID's were not military, they would have to come back the following day during normal business hours. The old guy immediately lost his shit, got out of the car and started telling me that he was a former general and president, and DIDNTIKNOWWHOHEIS?!\n\nI, of course, didnt have a clue who he was, i just thought he was some EDP, although it was odd that the other occupants were not reacting to his display. anyway, at some point trying to calm him down, he gets into the guard booth, and when i tell him I am going to put him in cuffs if he doesnt get out of there, he tells me to either call the commandant or shoot him. my coworker at this point had already called for an assist over the radio, so i just told him that if he didnt get out of the booth, that i wouldnt shoot him, but that I would physically pick him up and drop him on his face before applying handcuffs, due to the fact that he was a little old man and i was a hell of alot bigger than him. so he gets up, says 'your booth, my road' and starts jumping up and down until the MP's get there, along with my LT.\n\nthe LT manages to get ID's from all the other people in the car, while the MP's get mr president calmed down enough to talk to. turns out, homeboy actually IS a former president and general, just not from the U.S., and was invited to speak for the graduation week. Word was supposed to come down during briefing that he was here and a bit off his rocker due to old age (he actually said to my LT that if he wasnt who he said he was, would he still be able to touch his toes at 86 years old, then immediately bends over and touches his toes, like wtf, how is that a requirement to be president in your country dude?)... anyway, i was thanked by the LT and the MP command staff the next day for not actually dropping him on his face or spraying him, because the way he was acting I would have been justified in doing so. i just told them i would have felt bad for dropping a senile old man on his face in front of his family.\n\nFidel Ramos was the guy, if you're curious. never told me his name during his rantings, i guess he expected americans to just know who he was by looking at him for some reason? not that i would have known him by his name either, had to google him.\n\nTL;DR: Former president of the Philippines showed up where i worked and threw a temper tantrum because I didnt know who he was.",

        "text": "To preface this, I've only been working with my particular security company for only a month. I am a minor, but my security company is all about special events, e.g. concerts, basketball games, etc. so you don't have to actually carry a guard card as long as you only do bag checks or wanding. You aren't allowed to chase and tackle anyone, but other than that you perform most of the other duties of a regular security guard. Also, with our company we promote customer service as our #1 priority, making sure everyone goes home happy.\n\n\nThis particular instance occurred at a Dixie Chicks concert, at an outdoor venue, after the actual concert was over. I was stationed at a fire gate, which opened in case of a fire or other emergency, and for nothing else. While I was waiting for the hall to clear out so I could be relieved and go home, I was approached by two girls, who are obviously hammered beyond belief. Cue the conversation.\n\n\nDrunk Girl 1 &gt; Hey, our car is right down that way. Can we get through?\n\n\nMe &gt; No, sorry. It only opens for emergencies.\n\n\nDrunk Girl 2 &gt; Alright. If you open the gate for us, I'll show you my tits.\n\n\nNow, to make this clear, I'm very straight, and it would have been tantalizing if not for the fact that I take pride in being an honest person and not loosing my job. So, I politely tell her no, her tits do not constitute an emergency. Being drunk out of her mind, she doesn't take no for an answer. She adds $40 dollars to the mix, trying to bribe me with money to open the gate. I could have called my supervisor, but I didn't have a radio and I thought I could persuade them so that everyone goes home happy. After I denied their money, they changed tactics.\n\n\nDrunk Girl 1 &gt; What would you do if we tried to hop the fence? Would you try to stop us?\n\n\nThe wall in question is 8 feet tall, with no decent handholds. It would be a decent task for anyone, and impossible for someone as drunk as they were. I told them I wouldn't yell at them, I would just laugh. They seemed to sense that they couldn't make it over the fence, so they returned to their old tactic of offering their original bribe. Finally, I had enough.\n\n\nMe &gt; I'm not interested, I'm gay.\n\n\nYou should have seen the look on my face. I thought I was so smart, I had taken the clever way out. I wasn't gay, but I didn't find anything wrong by being thought of as gay.\n\n\nDrunk Girl 2 &gt; Oh! In that case, I can have our friend Bob come over and whip out his dick for you.\n\n\nMy ego quickly shattered. My foolproof tactic had only made things worse for me. A sense of dread crept in me as she started yelling for her friend Bob, knowing that I would now have to deal with at least three very drunk people by myself.\n\n\nMy saving grace came in the form of the first drunk girl, who realized that this was taking it a little far. She voiced her thoughts, and they quietly moved on down the stairs to the parking lot.",

        "text": "I've been working as a security officer for a few weeks now. I work several posts, depending on the needs of the company, but for the most part I work at a high end resort. The resort is a five star, however, in the summer they tend to lower their rates to the level of a chain hotel to attract business from locals and those on a budget (most try not to come to our part of the country in the summer, its hotter than Satan's sphincter). That means that on the weekends it's filled with a less than classy crowd of hooligans.\n\nThe majority of my nights are filled with boredom. Occasionally help a drunk to their room or tell a hooker to kick rocks. However, I remember my first night on the job being absolute insanity.\n\nI arrived to the resort at 20:00, met my new supervisor who proceeded to walk me through the property and show me all of the doors to secure and areas to patrol. In all, my 'training' lasted about an hour and consisted of my supervisor basically saying \"Try not to get the police involved, just handle it yourself\" before he took off. No demonstrating his approach to problems or guidelines on operation. \n\nOk, \"it can't be too bad, he wouldn't just toss me out to sea like that, it'll probably be a slow night of walking,\" I thought to myself. Damn, was I wrong.\n\nSo I'm on my patrol, and at about 22:00 I enter the lobby. The guy at the front desk says, \"Hey you know the police just got here, right?\" \"Uuuh, no. Why didn't you radio that to me?\" \"Oh sorry man, they went to building 2\". \n\nSo I head over to building 2, which I had passed by patrol maybe 15 minutes prior, and I find 3 local PD cruisers. I enter the building and the officers are mulling around a door about halfway down the hallway. \"What's up guys?\" \"Just doing a welfare check, we got a call of a suicidal woman\". Well fuck, this isn't a good way to start my first shift. I hang around with the officers, taking notes, for about 20 minutes before their supervisor arrives and decides that they need to enter the room. I unlock the door for them with my key card and they enter the room. Yup, lady decided to throw down some pills, she's laying on the bed in a pool of vomit. Paramedics come out and take her away.  \n\nGet told not to call the cops and within my first three hours the cops are there, and I didn't even call them. Shit. Okay hopefully that's all for tonight. I continue on my patrol. At 2330, half an hour before I'm to close the pool, as I'm on my patrol a housekeeper radios in to tell me to get to the pool ASAP. I get to the pool and what do I find? This woman with her bikini bottoms off recording herself getting finger blasted by her boyfriend on a lounge chair...with about half a dozen young children in the pool 15 feet in front of them. Fucking animals. Parents are pissed and swearing at me, I get the couple dressed. Cops come again, they get arrested.  \n\nWhat else can happen tonight? Assholes everywhere. At about 0300 I hear yelling and laughing from the pool area. I go in to kick whoever out. I find about 20 people, four separate groups, all drunk as fuck, out for a swim. I go in and start telling them to get out, every single group pulls the \"Why do we have to leave but they don't?\" card. God damn you all. Eventually one group agrees but they need towels. Okay, fine, I go grab a cart of towels and head back to pass them out. During the half hour process of getting these people out of the pool, I get two calls from the front desk. Belligerent man in the lobby and a noise complaint from a room. I head to the lobby, belligerent guy is yelling because his key doesn't work. I approach, calm him down, get him to sit on a couch to tell me what's going on. He says he's in room 354 and can't get in. I go over to talk to front desk, who says that room is unoccupied. Go back, and the guy is passed out. We'll shit, while he's asleep I can go handle some other shit right? I head back out to the pool area, assholes are all back in the pool. Now I start threatening to call the cops because they're trespassing. This get their attention and they finally leave.\n\nI head to the room of the noise complaint, hear yelling and screaming. I knock, no response just more cursing. I open the door and announce myself, this little lady 5'4 is laying into her husband's face with a hair dryer. God damnit. I step between them and she starts striking out at me, I just take the hits and get the guy to leave the room with me. I let him into an unoccupied room nearby, blocking her from following him inside. Cops get called, domestic violence, she goes away. \n\nI go back to the lobby and our boy has puked all over the white couch. Fuck me. I get him up, call housekeeping. I start talking to the guy. Get his name and then he hands me the keys that he said weren't working. His keys were to a Mariott, although we don't know which Mariott and there's several dozen in my city. \n\nThis man, we'll call him Kevin, isn't coherent enough to give us information on where he was staying. He has no idea what hotel he checked in to. After about half an hour of investigative work, googling and calling various hotels to see if he had booked a room, Kevin has an epiphany. He tells us that he was on a business trip, got drunk and made some friends. Those friends took him on a road trip to party in our city, where they abandoned him. His hotel was in a city over 100 miles away. We found a bus line and got him a cab ride to get back to his room later that morning.\n\nI wasn't trained to handle any of this bullshit, but I made it work...though my supervisor wasn't happy with my first report on the job...",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/4vjdn3/security_gets_screwed_at_the_adult_bookshop_and/",
        "text": "A little set-up: The adult bookstore is a fixture in the town next to ours.  It's actually just off the main strip.  This was the 90s, and they sold books, magazines, VHS tapes, some CDs and Laserdiscs (no DVDs, this was a while back).  They also have a section where there are booths where you can watch videos by feeding in quarters, like a video game.  (They also have a small theater on the other side of the store, with benches for groups, but I never had to go in there.)  And of course they sell sex toys, lube, edibles, that sort of thing.\n\nNow, I'm just out of high school, and I've never really been in this place longer than I've ever really needed to be -- I've bought a couple of magazines here, but that's it.  Never even knew about the booths until this job.\n\nAs soon as I arrive on location in my uniform, I get that look from the female manager on duty -- I had no idea what the look meant at the time, but now I know it means '**I don't like you and I want you out of here now.**'  So the manager gets to tell me what I'll be doing for the next twelve hours.  I will be standing inside the store looking mean.  I will be patrolling the store once an hour.  I am to include the booths as part of my patrol.  If I see anyone in the booths jerking off (or doing something worse), or if I see more than one person in any booth, I'm to knock on the door and tell them to knock that shit off.  One person to a booth, pants stay on, so forth.\n\nIt does not even occur to me that this requires me to **look in the booths while they're occupied** to perform this task.\n\nSo the first hour goes by, and I do my first patrol.  (The store is 1200 square feet.  30' x 40'.  I had to patrol this?)  Of course, there are a couple of guys in the booths, and one is in the middle of self-pleasure, and I knock on the window of the booth and tell him to keep it in his pants.\n\nAn hour later, I'm stopped by the store owner.  He takes me aside and dresses me down for *actually going into the booth area*, let alone interrupting one of his customers.  Didn't I know how to do my job?  Of course, I answer, your manager told me what to do.  No, she asserts, she told me *never* to go into the booth area.\n\nThey can't fire me, so I'm told to go outside, sit in my car, and make sure I'm visible by doing a 'patrol' once an hour.  And they'll be contacting my superiors about *this* incident.\n\nSo there I am, sitting in my car, worried sick that I'm going to get fired.  Well, at least it's turned into the easiest job I've ever had -- sit in my car, listen to the radio, walk around a 30' x 40' store once an hour.  Hell, there's a fast food restaurant not a hundred feet away -- I can walk over and get a drink whenever I want, as part of the patrol.\n\nThree hours later I'm standing around outside when some guy comes out of the store in a hurry, jumps into his car, and drives away.  Out comes the store owner.  Turns out they just got shoplifted.  Why didn't I stop the guy?  Well, because *I didn't know he was a shoplifter*, duh, but I don't say that out loud.  Store owner is *pissed*, but he's the one who told me to go stand outside.\n\nFinally my twelve hours are up. I go home and get some shut-eye, then get the call the next day -- the client does not want me back.  (Somehow I am not surprised.) Instead, I head to the company headquarters to discuss where they want me next.  I am talking to the dispatcher about this when the call comes through in the supervisor's office right next door.  It's the store owner, and he is *livid*.  I only got half the conversation, and I only knew it was the store owner because the phone system had caller ID.  But my supervisor is apologizing left and right, telling the owner that I was inexperienced, it was my first job, she'd set it right -- and then suddenly she's 'I'm sorry you feel that way' -- and she hangs up.  The store owner had cancelled the contract.\n\nIt gets **BETTER**.\n\nI wasn't in trouble -- this very thing had happened to another guy who'd been sent out there (well, not the part with the shoplifter, but he'd been told, by the manager, to do dumb things so the store owner would get rid of him).  The store owner was a real troublesome client, and the supervisor said it was amazing I'd made it the entire shift.  She knew there'd be trouble when she sent me out there, but it's contract security -- you send who you have available.  (At least that's how they ran in the 90s.)  She had a few more things I could do, and while they weren't cushy jobs like that one, they were still things that required a 12-hour shift.\n\nSo a month later I'm visiting HQ again, talking with dispatch and trying to get a more regular shift.  And the supervisor, again, she's in the next office, gets a call.  Guess who it is?  Turns out that the other security outfits in town wouldn't take the store owner's shit, and he's been operating without security for the last 30 days -- and his insurance rates have gone through the roof because of it.  He's hiring the company for security again.  At a nice markup, too.\n\nThe supervisor sees me in the office, smiles, and says, \"You want to work for the &lt;adult bookstore&gt;, again?\"\n\n(I know this is where y'all want to hear me say I told them \"Not on your life\", but really, it was a cushy job.  And this time it was at a higher rate.  But THIS time when I went back, I got my directions straight from the store owner, NOT the manager lady, and knew enough this time that I wasn't to bother the patrons in the booths.  I *was* supposed to patrol the booth area, in fact, once every four hours, and if there were any... spills... I was to contact store personnel for a cleanup.\n\nTwo weeks later while working the location, the store manager finally broke, and quit, screaming at me, then the owner, then the owner's wife, very thoroughly burning her bridges.  I still have no idea what that woman's issue was with me to this day.\n\nAnd a month after that, the company decided they no longer wanted to work with the client, and I got moved to another location.)\n\nThis post is slightly different from the one on /r/TalesFromAdultStore.  It was late when I posted that one, and my brain kinda wasn't on all five cylinders.\n\nTL;DR: Learn to read. I take lots of time writing these incidents down.  If you can't take the time to read them, what are you doing on reddit? :)",

For one, we have strange people parking after hours in employee and visitor parking, which immediately makes us perk up our ears, swing around every camera, and send one of our own out which is just plain inconvenient, considering we have armor and it's 80+ degrees outside.  I actually had to break the news to my team on release day that we were a stop and that people were just going to walk up, and at the time, I didn't think anything of it.  But today seems to be the first day for everyone to start Pokemon hunting which is ridiculous.  \n\nIf you're having a similar experience, I've been told from my manager that this has happened with the game Ingress, and that you can contact the company Niantic and request to not be a stop.  This is looking like a keen possibility for us, as we just have a bunch of teen-aged girls and middle-aged men (seemingly the only two demographics that do this kind of thing on a Sunday afternoon) driving up and sitting in the parking lots on their phones.",

        "text": "[Recap: My site was made responsible for another site’s security, but we weren’t told about it. Our client’s HQ stepped in and made things worse by handing out tons of badges and prox cards. We caught the flak, and I’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop. Also, the guy who we’re supposed to talk to at the client (official account contact or some such) is totally incommunicado to the point that we have no proof he exists.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/4pwvqa/our_client_didnt_tell_us_about_an_entire_new/)\n\nFor those of you who want the short version: we fixed the problem, but the client doesn’t find out and instead calls my boss to scream at him. My boss decides that the job isn’t worth the abuse and finds a new job.\n\nWhen I made the post, I was worried for Monday – surely, the client will call us up, mad as hell, and demand some sort of scapegoat. Given the angry response we got over the whole issue, I figured we’d get a call on Monday.\n\nNah. I get in on Monday and it’s dead quiet. A couple of calls from the new site to get badges tinkered with. My boss sits the whole day, anxiously awaiting a call from the client. No calls. Fine, they’ll call Tuesday.\n\nTuesday rolls around. We field some more calls from the new site, but things are actually almost together – nearly 80% of the people on site have badges with pictures and appropriate access, and the only people who don’t are people who haven’t started working yet. Some doors at our site magically lock themselves because one of our day-shift guys decided he was Mr. Robot or something and made a huge mess of our systems. Our boss is even more anxious. Someone from our security company called to tell him how disappointed they were in the way that everything was handled – my boss sat there, phone in hand, and with a dead-inside expression, answered every question with “yes” or “no” while the guy bitched him out. Still no call from the client.\n\nIt’s Wednesday. I arrive for work, but there’s no boss. The other guy on my shift says he was here, but the day shift guys said he left after getting a phone call. He doesn’t come back. Late that night while I’m checking exterior doors, I get a phone call from my boss. He sounds really happy.\n\nApparently the client called my boss, about an hour before my shift started. This guy, who couldn’t be bothered to call us to warn us about the new facility or the hundreds of new employees, called up my boss to scream at him about how difficult his job was, and how he personally had to fix everything now that my boss had ruined everything, forever. Ten minutes into the conversation, my boss realized that the guy doesn’t know that we’ve fixed the situation and tried to explain that actually the client didn’t have to do anything. This was met with a torrent of hysterical and pretty nasty abuse. For my boss, that was it. He finished the call with the client, and cut out early, and went home at 11AM. When he got there, he sent out an email to our branch office, declaring he was quitting. \n\nWithout getting too specific, he found a new job. This is going to mean a lot of vacancies – my boss is the best thing about this site, and no one wants to take chances with a new manager given past experiences with our company. Guards are already updating resumes and talking about what companies around us are hiring. When it rains, it pours, right?",

        "text": "I was asked to x-post this here so here it is.\n\nSo my site is pretty strange. There are three buildings owned by the management company. I work for the main one, the other 2 are only a block away. Each building has about 4 or 5 guards, and since the buildings are so close, we sometimes switch shifts among ourselves with approval.\n\nSo usually, the shifts that are switched are done so between day and swing. Nobody wants to work the grave shift but this isn't what this post is about. I have noticed that the day shift consists of middle aged people, not really interesting. The swing shifts are all guys in their 20's. But the graveyard guys are something else. I have met each one since I do a lot of favors for people by shift swapping.\n\nOne dude is missing the three middle fingers in his right hand. We call him \"Captain Hook\" or \"Claw Machine\" depending on the mood. One day I asked him what happened to his hand, all he said was \"agriculture accident.\" Ok then.\n\nThe second guy is not very weird personality-wise, but he has some nasty habits. He will regularly leave cups with the blackest, most powerful smelling coffee around the common areas of our workstation. He will occasionally leave his work shirts in our private bathroom, with the collars almost as dark as his coffee.\n\nThe third guy is just a sleeper. He sleeps for about 2 or 3 hours a night. Our building engineers like to mess with him. On a few occasions, they would place the building's alarm system in test mode and pull the fire alarm. Fire alarms are extremely loud, especially at around 3am when one is asleep. The guard would then come rushing down to the lobby from wherever he was sleeping with bloodshot eyes, only to be met by 2 or 3 engineers laughing their collective asses off.\n\nThe fourth guy though, takes the cake. He comes about 30 mins before the start of his shift and just sits in his car. When it is time for him to start, he hobbles over to the lobby with a duffel bag and his desk fan. He starts his shift every night by wiping EVERYTHING with rubbing alcohol. The keys, keycards, radio, flashlight, even the phone. The Keyboard and mouse too. He is also a huge believer in Bigfoot and the supernatural. He is constantly calling in sick. I believe it is due to the fact that he has limited contact with germs from the rubbing alcohol.\n\nAny of you guys notice anything weird about your graveyard shift guys? I would be really interested to read about it.",

I asked him to leave, but he spoke back in Portuguese with a Brazilian dialect. I gave him hand signals to clear out and don't come back. He left without any further problems...for all of 15 minutes.\n\nWhen we have someone loitering, we're instructed to do a couple more rounds and pay close attention to the area in which the person was loitering to prevent any drug deals. So on my second round a few minutes later, I caught him again, sitting down in the same spot listening to music. I stood by, leaning on the fence, just looking at him and laughing. He was surprised when he saw me, and I guess it made him angry. I should have called the police, but hey, I'm pretty lenient.\n\nHe walked up to me with his chest puffed out and started speaking Portuguese. I just told him to leave again, and he left again. Not even 5 minutes later, a resident comes in and asks me to go outside to check out some suspicious kid hanging out by the emergency exit on the south-side of the building.\n\n\"Figures...\"\n\nI went back out and saw him yet again, in the same spot, listening to the same music. I raised my voice and told him not to come back or he'd be arrested for trespassing. This time, he put up his hands like he was going to fight me. I reacted accordingly and laughed, then he got on his bike and road away again. He was too busy looking back at me to watch where he was going, and as he was crossing the road his front tire hit a curb and he fell off of his bicycle and landed on his noggin.",

        "text": "This is way less exciting than the crackhead encounters that get posted here, but I need to vent this wall of text to someone who can understand it.\n\nMy company has a contract with a large multinational company. My site manages badging, alarms, and cameras for a number of smaller office sites in the US, excluding the big corporate HQ. \n\nAt the start of June, we suddenly have new alarms popping up in our system for a facility in a different state that we’ve never heard of. We ask our boss, the site supervisor; he’s equally surprised. He promises to follow up for us. The alarms continue to fly fast and furious from this mystery facility. My boss tells us to ignore the alarms unless one that’s really pressing (fire, broken glass, panic button) shows up. Luckily that never happens, but even if it did, we don't even know the address of this new site for a 911 call. My boss assures us that he will find out what's going on.\n\nAnother week passes. I’m passing time in the control room when we receive an angry phone call from a higher-up inside our security company at The Client’s HQ. Why don’t the damn employee badges for the new site work? I have no idea what he’s talking about. The guy from corporate gets madder. Apparently our site was supposed to issue two-hundred-plus badges for employees and contractors at the new mystery site.\n\nMy boss takes the phone and begins to argue with the corporate guy. Eventually my boss works out that The Client’s new facility is supposed to be open, but none of the badges that were issued to the new employees work. \n\nBadges? We didn’t issue any badges. We haven’t added any new employees to the system at all. The corporate guy tells my boss that The Client’s Account Contact was supposed to work all this out with us.\n\nThe Account Contact may or may not exist. He replaced an outgoing manager who was pretty hands-on, but after the switch it was radio silence from day one. The Account Contact’s company directory profile is empty except for a disconnected phone number and an email address that never replies to anything. No mandatory picture, no LinkedIn profile. My boss has spent most of the month trying to find someone who has even spoken with the guy, to no avail. He’s never contacted any site supervisor or manager. The best part is that our ghost’s boss wasn’t even aware he was working under him – he had never been notified of the change in the chain of command.\n\nMy boss agrees to undertake damage control for corporate. We start to exchange emails with security at The Client’s HQ. We ask for a list of employees at the new site; we receive an incomplete list of people transferred to the site from other locations and some of the new hires. We ask for a list of badges that were issued; they tell us that someone at The Client requested a huge number of temporary badges for the new site, which were sent out the week before. The badges were not sequentially numbered, nor were the badge numbers logged. Someone just took a big armful out of a drawer somewhere and mailed them to the new site. They can’t even tell us which badges are missing, because they don’t keep a full log of temp badges on hand. \n\nWe spent Thursday and Friday looking for needles in haystacks and managed to set up a whopping eleven new badges. Almost all were building staff managed by contractors who actually had their shit together, personnel-wise. The existing employees who transferred got access granted, but we’re still looking at seventy-five-percent-or-more of the people who work there having no access. We continue to get angry calls from people at the site and at The Client's HQ about the situation at a rate of two or three an hour until the end of the business day.\n\nTo summarize – we have no idea who has what badge. Even if we did know that, we have no idea what access permissions they have. And even if we knew what access permissions they had, they still lack the corporate IDs needed to prove that they are who their badges say they are. To make matters worse, we don’t even have a chain of command to unravel this disaster. As far as we know, the Client Contact who was supposed to communicate all this to us might not even exist. I'm not even sure which is worse: the Contact not existing, or the client actively giving so few shits that he manages to forget about issuing badges to almost two hundred people.\n\nI’m not looking forward to Monday - unless a miracle happened over the weekend, I doubt this will have resolved itself. The worst part is that my boss will probably end up taking the majority of the shaft from corporate. Office security is the easiest job I’ve ever had, but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t occasionally find a way to fuck you. ",

Her boyfriend is likewise not some young kid with a crush. He's in his thirties, and 'stalking' at that age (imho) is a lot creepier than it is in younger kids who still have a lot of growing up to do.\n\nAnyway, apparently this guy had tried to intercept her at work in the parking lot, but she had gotten to work a little early and he didn't have a chance. So, after sitting around for a while he wrote out a note and left it under the windshield wiper of her car. She showed it to us. Mostly just sappy stuff about wanting to get back together and soul mates and forever and we can work it out. \n\nRight.\n\nSo we get a general description of the guy from her, as well as his name. We replayed the video footage of the guy when he was in the parking lot and printed off some still shots of his vehicle as well as his face (as best we could. The face was pretty grainy and he was wearing a hat). \n\nWe posted the pics in the office and put it in as part of the pass-on for other shifts. Things remained pretty calm.\n\nA few weeks later the nurse reported finding more notes on her car, and she'd been getting some pretty disturbing phone calls at her home from this nutjob. Stuff along the lines of \"if I cant have you nobody can\" and threatening to kill her pet, her, or himself on any given day. \n\nWe highly recommended calling the cops and putting in a request for a restraining order.\n\nShe didn't want to do either. \n\nBut she did feel nervous about walking out to the parking lot at 11 o'clock at night in a rather secluded area, so we were more than happy to do escort detail. \n\nNo weapons, just a big MagLite, which offers itself as a blunt object if things go south.... and of course if things *do* go south I'm probably going to be wishing I had something other than a blunt object to defend myself with. \n\nIn any event, one night my partner and I are getting off duty at midnight. We're walking through the parking lot and he suddenly glances over and sees the big red truck that we've \"been on the lookout\" for. He didnt break stride, he just casually told me what he saw. I looked and confirmed it.\n\nThe nightshift crew that night was a single officer- a skinny teenager who didnt have his drivers license and would be about as helpful in a fight as a foam pool noodle. \n\nWe casually strolled back inside, noting that the nurse's vehicle was still in the lot, and in all likelyhood she had been asked to stay late due to low manning.\n\nI found her on the 1st floor, informed her that her stalker was out in the parking lot. She went pale. I told her to stay inside. My partner was up in the security office calling the local police to remove the guy from the property. \n\nThe rest was pretty straight forward. Cops showed up, told the guy to beat it. He got in his truck and left pretty quickly. Didn't come back.\n\nWe walked the nurse out to her car later just for her own piece of mind (although we could see on the cameras that no one was out there anymore) \n\nI dunno if she ever resolved her issues with the guy, but whatever happened it stayed the hell off the VA Nursing Home property. I think the cops being called left the guy wary of returning. \n\nAnyway, that's probably the most interesting of the stalker stories in my files. ",
