        "text": "My first for this sub! Long time reader, your posts get me through the days!\n\nBackground: I work for a mobile telco providing support for biz, consumers and our stores on everything from billing to tech support. \n\nThis was my 3rd call of the day so I was already well and truely over the day by the time he rolled onto my line. He was a small business customer, and a constant late payer. \n\nApologies in advance if formatting is off, typing on a mobile but will try to check later if it’s ugly looking! &lt;3\n\nMe: *intro*\n\nCust: I want to know what this extra $10 fee is on my account, I didn’t add any extras this month. \n\nMe: okay let’s take a look! *validates customer*. Right so I see that the $10 extra this month is actually a late payment fee, we haven’t received payment for the February billing cycle. Have you made payment for this already?\n\nCust: yes! I paid that ages ago!\n\nMe: when exactly did you pay this? Our last payment shows in February, before this invoice was generated.\n\nCust: I paid on March 30th in full by bank transfer. \n\nMe: so that payment hasn’t cleared yet as it was over a weekend, the banks won’t clear that until Tuesday due to the long weekend unfortunately. I can also see the late payment fee was added to the account on the 27th, before you made the payment anyway. \n\nCust: But you’ve never charged me a late payment fee before, I’m not paying that.\n\nMe: Your bill was due on the 21st, and it’s clearly noted on the first page of the invoice that failure to pay by due date will incur a late payment fee, in this case we still allowed you until the 27th before we applied it. I can see in the past it looks like you avoided it even tho you have paid late several months in a row, however it is at our discretion whether we charge this fee or not. In this case we have, and you will need to pay it with your next invoice. \n\nCust: but that’s not fair, if you haven’t charged me this before how can you expect me to pay it?! (At this point he’s yelling into the phone like a child). \n\nMe: it’s very clear on the invoice that you will be charged this fee. You’ve just been lucky to avoid it in the past. It’s also in your contract. I can send you a copy of each for your reference if you’d like? In either case, you’ll see this as a charge on your next invoice. I’d recommend paying future ones by the date listed on the invoice to avoid this happening again. \n\nCust: this is bullshit! I’m going to change to *competitor that also charges the same late payment fee we do*!\n\nMe: that’s your decision, they also charge late payment fees just so you’re aware. If you’re planning on taking your number with you just note that your account will be closed when the request is sent by your new provider, and when the account is closed you’ll incur a early termination charge of $980.00 + GST for braking your 2 year contract. \n\nCust: F**k you! \n\nMe: was there anything else I could help you with today?\n\nCust: *hangs up*\n\nI will never understand why people get upset about these. We have VERY generous payment terms (bill at the start of the month and payment due nearly 3 weeks later) compared to others in our local industry who have 7 day payment terms. \n\nThe sad thing is, if he wasn’t a total dick I’d have refunded it for him like I’ve done to others many times in the past! Mistakes happen, and all you have to do is just ask nicely and I’ll cave! :-)",

(*Verification ensues*). Right let me just check the notes on your account..\n\n \n\n**Insane:** KEVIN WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL ME BACK! [COMPANY] OWES ME A BILLION POUNDS! I AM WATCHING YOU ON MY SECURITY CAMERA RIGHT NOW!\n\n \n\n(*At this point I was sorely tempted to call her bluff and ask what colour shirt I was wearing, but decided not to set her off any more. While she was ranting, I found the ticket Kevin had left. Insane Psycho was disputing unpaid bills which clearly had not been paid. Also, Kevin wasn't available. Insane Psycho had spoken to a few other agents, all of whom had hung up due to abuse. Foolishly, I decided to try and help her.*)\n\n \n\n**Me:** I'm afraid Kevin isn't available right now but he did leave a detailed note, so hopefully I can help you.\n\n \n\n**Insane:** Do you have a daughter?\n\n \n\n**Me:** No... (*True*)\n\n \n\n**Insane:** Oh, I think you do...\n\n \n\n(*This was said in a vaguely threatening way and in retrospect I should have ended the call then. However, Insane Psycho was so over the top that I couldn't take her seriously.*)\n\n \n\n**Me:** ... Anyway, I see from Kevin's note that you're saying you have paid those bills which are showing on our system as unpaid, is that right?\n\n \n\n**Insane:** YOU NEED TO CANCEL THAT FUCKING DEBT RIGHT NOW!\n\n \n\n**Me:** I'm afraid I can't do that, cases like this we need to to an investigation...\n\n \n\n**Insane:** [COMPANY] IS TRYING TO KILL ME! I'VE HAD TO GO TO HOSPITAL IN AN AMBULANCE TWICE TODAY! I'VE HAD TWO HEART ATTACKS BECAUSE OF ALL THE STRESS [COMPANY] IS CAUSING ME AND ALL YOU FUCKERS KEEP SAYING I'M ABUSIVE AND HANGING UP ON ME!\n\n \n\n**Me:** Well you are being a bit abusive.\n\n \n\n**Insane:** YOU FUCKING [COMPANY] BASTARD, I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE AND I DEMAND YOU RETURN EVERYTHING I'VE EVER PAID [COMPANY]!\n\n \n\n**Me:** OK this is your second warning, speak to me like that again and I will terminate this call.\n\n \n\n**Insane:** YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME YOU ASSHOLE!\n\n \n\n**Me:** Right, that's strike 3. Goodbye.\n\n \n\n----\n\n \n\nThe next day my previous TL came up to me and asked me had I spoken to Insane Psycho. Since he'd had to previously give me a writeup for giving out to customer, I was apprehensive.\n\n \n\n**Me:** Uh... Oh yeah, her.\n\n \n\n**TL:** She's crazy, isn't she?\n\n \n\n**Me:** (*relieved*) Yeah, she lost her shit a long time ago and never found it again.\n\n \n\n----\n\n \n\nI checked in on Insane's account a couple of times since. There were multiple other tickets stating how she used disgusting, degrading language, though nobody said what she specifically said.\n\n \n\nHowever, I did speak to a few other people who had dealt with Insane Psycho. A couple of fellas when asked if they had daughters made the mistake of saying \"Yes\"; since few people at this call center were over 30, their daughters were not out of primary school, and in fact had not yet left pre-school.\n\n \n\nOne guy was told that \"YOUR DAUGHTERS TITS ARE COVERED IN SPUNK\" and the other that \"YOUR DAUGHTER IS BEING RAPED IN PRISON\". She may have used the N-word to refer to the men in question, but that might be jsut me manufacturing a memory of her being even worse. Yeah, this is the sort of shit people were dealing with.\n\n \n\nA girl made the mistake of calling Insane Psycho \"love\"; for Americans, it's not uncommon in the UK or unheard of in Ireland to address a stranger in this manner, and there's (usually) nothing sexual or inappropriate about it. Insane Psycho, naturally enough, exploded \"HOW FUCKING DARE YOU! ARE YOU CALLING ME A PROSTITUTE?! YOU ARE!\"\n\n \n\n----\n\n \n\nInsane Psycho's account was closed due to non-payment, but somehow she managed to get a new one set up. This, too, ended up getting shut down after someone high-up at [company] listened to a few of the calls and decided their workers' mental health was more important than the money of one angry, abusive customer. The second account was closed down with immediate effect, and all outstanding balances and early termination fees waived. A ticket was added saying to never give this person an account again.",

However...\n\n\n\nMe- me CMF- conspiracy-minded fool\n\n\n\nWe'd actually been having a reasonable conversation until this point- his email address declared his love for the same football team as my partner supports, so we complained about how badly they were doing in the Championship. Anyway-\n\n\n\nCMF- 'So what's this £3.42 on my account?'\n\n\n\nMe- (pulls up account) 'Yes, I've found that amount. It covers a small amount of usage when you had estimated meter readings. When you provided readings, it altered your balance and the £3.42 credited back into your account. Your payments are covering what you're using, everything's running smoothly.'\n\n\n\nCMF- 'But why is it on my statement? Doesn't make sense to me.'\n\n\n\nMe- 'I'm sorry Mr X, I know that the statements can be confusing, I didn't understand them myself before I started working here! (launches into blurb) By law we have to give you detailed information about what's happening in your account. Sometimes that means that you can see small amounts being debited from and credited to your account. I appreciate that seeing these can be concerning, but the invoice you have is for the correct amount after it's all been worked out at the end of the billing period.'\n\n\n\nCMF- (silence for a moment, I could hear the cogs turning) 'Ohhhh, I see. IIIII get it, I know what you lot are doing.'\n\n\n\nMe, (with the sinking feeling that comes from realising that a) you've got a nutter on the line and b) I'm on a freephone number and he's retired and will spin this call out as long as he can)- 'What do you mean sir?'\n\n\n\nCMF- 'Nice little scam isn't it? A couple of quid here, a couple of quid there, it all adds up.'\n\n\n\nMe- 'Sorry, what are you saying?'\n\n\n\nCMF- 'No wonder you're raking it in hand over fist. I bet you're all in on it! How much extra do you get on your pay from this con?'\n\n\n\nMe (realising that whatever I say will never be enough, he's on his high horse now and he's not getting off)- 'Sir, you are accusing my company, my colleagues and myself of being thieves. Is that correct? '\n\n\n\nCMF (not quite willing to say it)- 'Well, it's the only thing that makes sense. Creaming money off the top, don't you earn enough?'\n\n\n\nMe (working part time for minimum wage, a certain amount of ice may have entered my tone)- 'Sir, I would like to put this forward as a complaint. Do you have a few minutes for me to *officially log* these *accusations* so they can be *fully investigated* by the fraud department and the *police*? We have to take these things seriously. Would you like to proceed?'\n\n\n\nCMF (after such a long pause that I thought he'd hung up, in a small voice)- 'Fuck off' SLAM\n\n\n\nAnd that is how people who can't back up ridiculous allegations cope with being wrong.",

I always try to be understanding and pleasant because, well, obviously I see the stories in this subreddit. \n\n(Side note: my god, some people are awful. I'm very sorry you all have to deal with that craziness.)\n\nI also try to take the surveys at the end if they're offered. I always give the 5 star or \"yes\" ratings because I know how these surveys work at my jobs. I work in retail and food service. How it works there is basically - if you don't score perfectly, 10/10, every other response is just as bad as a 1/10. It's either perfect, or you suck. No in-between. Incredibly stupid in my opinion. \n\nDo you even get to see the results of your survey responses? And how much of an impact do high/low marks have on your job? Whether it be your work-load, pressure from higher-ups, praise from higher-ups, etc. \n\nI know that every company and employer would have different policies, and varying degrees of how management enforces these policies. But I'd like to see the different perspectives as well. It's very interesting to me - looking at another field of work from the employee's perspective. \n\nJust curious if what I'm doing is making an impact. For the most part, the employees I've talked to were nothing but nice and helpful. So thanks for continuing to be positive and helpful! Considering there are so many terrible people out there, and you get the rants and tirades from people who don't know their ass from a hole in a ground lol..\n\nKeep doin' what you're doin', and try not to lose your mind in the process. &lt;3\n\nStay gold, Ponyboy",

At this time, I incorrectly believed that the company had only sent emails. I'm **Me** and the Angry Woman is **AW**.\n\n \n\n**AW:** Why has my bill gone up?\n\n \n\n**Me:** Ah, yeah, the bills went up across the board at the end of December. We sent everybody emails to advise them of that.\n\n \n\n**AW:** Email? Nobody uses email any more! Social media has replaced email!\n\n \n\n**Me:** No, email is still widely used...\n\n \n\n**AW:** No! It isn't! Social media is what people use! Nobody checks email!\n\n \n\n**Me:** That's not true.

You have to tell me when you're increasing your prices!\n\n \n\n**Me:* We did, in the email sent to the address you gave us when you signed up. If you choose to ignore our notification...\n\n \n\n**AW:** No! Nobody uses email! People use social media! This is illegal!\n\n \n\n**Me:** No it isn't, email is a perfectly acceptable method of communication.\n\n \n\n**AW:* It's not, because nobody uses email! You have to use a method people actually use!\n\n \n\nAt this pont she demanded to speak to a manager. I told the TL on duty the situation, and she said to just credit AW the £10. AW was quite happy with that and even decided to stay with the company, even though the deadline for leaving with no ETC had not yet passed. She never *quite* said the company had to use Facebook to tell her about such private financial information, but that's what she implied.\n\n \n\nAs a coda, when I discussed this with some co-workers, a fellow phone monkey told me about a guy who, upon being told that he had been sent emails and txts about unpaid bills, sincerely asked why the company didn't try to get him on WhatsApp.",

        "text": "I work in sales for a Telecomms co.. \n\nToday's tale took place on a Saturday. Nothing significant about it. The only thing that stands our from this day was when I got a call from someone who went to Harvard. \n\nNow before I begin I want to tell you that when a potential customer calls in we ask for their street address for two reasons. One is to verify the address is actually within our footprint and two is because we build their order in the address so we can give them accurate pricing. \n\nI will be \"Me\" and Mr. Harvard will be \"H\" but only because I don't have the energy to type what I want to call him every time he spoke. I need you to imagine everything that H says in the most condescending \"i'm better than you\" tone possible. \n\nMe- Thank you for calling this is Bendstraw how can I help you?\n\nH- How much is it for internet and cable total including taxes?\n\nMe- Alright, I'll be glad to look into that for you. \nWhat is the address and we'll customize the package for you. \n\nH- Why should I give you that. I went to Harvard and I know you don't need all that to give me pricing. \n\nMe- Well H, we build the packages directly in the address so that we can give you accurate rates. Without the address I cannot give you the total including the taxes, fees, and surcharges. \n\nH- You should have all the tax rates there. You don't need my address. \n\nMe- In order to give any pricing I need to have an address. \n(repeat ad infinitum) \n\nH- No you don't. Just give me the pricing. I went to Harvard and I know you can do this. Unless you weren't trained properly. Or is it that you aren't smart enough.\n\n(and it was at that moment my friends that you could almost hear the audible snap of my mind being 110 percent done with this man)\n\nMe- *twitch* Sir, I cannot give you what you are asking unless I know the exact address where we will be setting the service. That is how we do things here. I don't know why you won't share it. I am not signing you up for service with the address. I am just trying to get you pricing. So if you would just give me the address I will be able to give you accurate numbers. \n\nH- fine it's 123 main st. in town with zip. \n\nMe- Thank you and the apartment number? \n\nH- (insert tirade here where he insults my intelligence again and flips out because we should know the tax rates for every place we set up and it won't be any different regardless of apartment number) \n\nMe- The prices will be the same but company policy is to build in the address to guarantee 100 percent accuracy. (and to save time so I don't have to re-code the entire order if he decides he wants it) \nAnd sir I understand what you are asking but in the time you've spent fighting sharing the address with me I could have priced out several options for you.\n\nH- I don't think you know how to help me. I'm asking for something simple and you just aren't smart enough to help. \n\nMe- Alright listen, I know how to do my job. I am empowered to help you and I am more than happy to do so. I need the apartment so that I can code the order and give you accurate numbers. If you want my help you need to share that with me. Also if I am going to help you I am telling you now that I do not appreciate being talked down to and I will not tolerate it from you. Now do you want to give me the apartment so I can help you with this or not? \n\nH- (meekly) It's apartment x......... and I'd like to speak to a supervisor please. \n\nMe- Sure, i'll be happy to get one for you. Hold please. \n(transfer) Byeeeeeee\n\n\nNormally my supervisors have my back and would have told him that I was following proper procedure. That day the supervisor didn't tell him that. Instead she made an order without using the address and estimated his taxes which at some point i had offered to do but he wanted exact numbers. So as far as I am concerned they can both pound sand. \nApparently a Harvard degree can't buy good manners. \n\nTLDR: Guy calls in refused to give me his address and wanted exact pricing. He went to Harvard and has a superiority complex and talked down to me the whole time. I called him out and transferred him to a supervisor. ",

I passed him every day, nice guy who held a sign saying, \"Will work for food.\" We would all try to help him out if we could. One day our office manager invited him in, and as he was in the back with us, the manager offered him a jon. The guy looked around at all of us, sneered, and said, \"I make more damn money on the road than any of you will ever see.\" And he walked out.\n\nWrong thing to say, buddy, especially f you want to stay on your corner. From that point on we went out of our way to harass him in any way we could. He eventually gave up and left the corner, and probably found another.\nThat experience happened right before the city did an expose' on these so-called homeless, and they found these people who would drive to their street corners in nice cars, and go home at night to homes they owned.",

The survey is pretty standard and almost identical for each state. Questions like \"do you have diabetes\" \"do you provide long term healthcare for a loved one\" \"do you wear sunscreen\" \"how tall are you\"  \n\n\nYesterday was my 6th day in a row working and I was so fed up with people trying to waste my time because they thought they were funny or paranoid [extreme end of any political side]'s interrogating me about why we wanted to know if they got a flu shot. Just tell me no to the whole survey if you're that private, I won't get my feelings hurt.\n\n\nLiterally just facts about yourself to help the health department get a picture of the health of the entire state.\n\n\nI called this man, and when he picked up I went through my intro and he had me repeat it which wasn't unusual but usually by the tone of voice they ask in you can tell if they're trying to be a dick or not.  He chuckled and was trying to sound \"sly\" and asked what kind of questions and I told him. \n\n\nHe started on a rant about [his state] which happens all the time so I cut him off and I said \"sir this is a factual multiple choice survey, no one is hearing this but me. Are you going to take the survey, yes or no?\"\n\n\n\"Hmm I'll think about it...what really is the problem in [state is]--\"\n\n\n\"You are much better off calling your representative about that. Are you interested in taking the survey yes or no\"\n\n\n\"Wouldn't do much good theyre all democrats I live in a goddamn blue state. Are you being paid for this or volunteering?\" \n\n\n\"That's not relevant sir are you going to take the survey or not?\"\n\n\"I might--\"\n\n\n\"Yes. Or. No.\"\n\n\n\"Sure I'll try your *liberal* survey\" \n\n\nWe got through all the screening questions (are you a [state] resident, how many adults in household etc) except the last which was \"is this a private residence?\" There is no refuse option for this question just yes or no, because if it wasn't a private residence it screened hem out completely.\n\n\n\"I don't think I need to answer that\"\n\n\n\"If you don't answer we cannot go any further in the survey\" \n\n\n\"No no I'm not answering that just tell me the next question (laughs like an asshole)\"\n\n\n\"You cannot skip this question if you want to take the survey\"\n\n\n\"(Still laughing) no really just go on--\"\n\n\n\"Those are all my questions today thank you for your time\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh...um ok\"\n\n*click*\n\nI know this was a long way to tell a short story but I was so satisfied that he sounded disappointed when I told him that the interview was over, I know he wanted to \"teach me why the survey is biased\" or troll me because it happens all the time. I don't care just tell me what to put in the computer. When respondents decide to be rude it's the best when they do exactly what they need to do so I can properly shut them down. It doesn't happen often. \n\n\n\nTL;DR Man tries to waste my time by going through a survey and refusing all questions (happens a lot) and he refuses the one question that lets me hang up on him. And it felt great. \n\nYay for tiny victories ",

I will be glad to help you with that can I have your account info. (verifies account info) \n\nMe- Okay, well Ma'am it looks like your services were disconnected due to non payment. To restore services you would need to pay the full amount due on the bill. \n\nTHB- Well, I can only afford x amount. Will that get my services back?\n\nMe- Sorry as per policy once services have been cut off for non-payment the only way to get them back is to pay in full. \n\nTHB- But it's Christmas time. My family is coming tomorrow. I need some cable. \n\nMe-I understand that and I can understand your frustration but unfortunately there is no work around. The system won't let me do anything unless it's paid in full. \n\nTHB- But I thought Christmas was a time for forgiveness. \n\nMe-(floored that she would even try that) Well Ma'am it is but you still have to pay the cable bill to have the services. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nTHB- No, I guess not  *click*\n----------------------------\n\n... She was polite and kind the whole time which I was grateful for but I cannot believe that she tried to pull the \"but Christmas is a time for forgiveness line\" I was in total WTF mode.  I would rather a screaming jerk face trying to argue services over someone trying to make me feel guilty for doing my job. \n...... ",

        "text": "Ok I'm hooked now.\n\n\n\nMy first job was taking 999 calls. This is the emergency number in the UK, but differs from 911 in a couple of ways. For one, the call goes to anywhere in the country as the whole system is networked, and two, we ask the caller if they want fire, police or ambulance and connect them on to the relevant service, rather than taking the details and dispatching units. Normally we pass the call off at that point, but if the caller can't give clear information we stay on the line, muted, until the call ends. The services know this of course and will sometimes call out 'operator' so we go in and offer what help we can.\n\n\n\n\nI had a call from a mobile. Bear in mind this was in the year 2001, phone tracing wasn't the speedy process it is today, so it was absolutely vital to get the address details.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo anyway... half twoish on a Sunday morning this guy calls in gibbering, couldn't get a word out of him. I was patient and eventually he said 'Ambulance! We need an ambulance.'\n\n\n\nNow the eagle eyed among you will recognise very early Sunday morning as being also very late Saturday night. So there's any amount of drunks getting in fights and being hit by cars, as well as the normal weekday stuff, all of which incidents require ambulance attendance. This often meant that the 999 operator could wait a long time, sometimes up to *half an hour*, before the service the caller needed even answered the phone. I hope it's better now, I had people die on the phone waiting.\n\n\n\nI was fully prepared for this so what I did when I had a caller waiting on the line was to be reassuring and make notes. Notes I made became important if the caller's signal dropped and we couldn't get back through.\n\n\n\nSo I managed to calm the guy down and get his address, and his story. He'd been in bed with his wife, who was very nearly full term with their first child. She'd woken him by gasping as labour started, and her waters had broken. Most first time parents panic, but the official advice is to get someone to drive you to hospital, an ambulance isn't generally required- mothers who might need one are told if they do. I told him this, but he shouted at me- \n\n\n\nHim- 'NO, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, IT'S COMING NOW!'\n\n\n\nNow I had to admit at this point I still thought he was just a new dad freaking out because his partner's making terrible noises he's never heard from her before, but he started describing what was happening.\n\n\n\nHim-'She's all folded up, like... she's all red... I can see a bubble'\n\n\n\nA bubble, I thought. A bubble? Oh god, could he be saying....\n\n\n\nMe- 'James... JAMES. Ok, listen to me. This bubble, is it between her legs?'\n\n\n\nHim- 'Yes... it's coming from her... (traditional British bloke unwillingness to use the proper term) downstairs!'\n\n\n\nNow I was only 19 and hadn't been in the job long and I was stuck in the queue for the ambulance. My manager was aware of what was going on but sadly there was no magical direct line through to the ambulance and redialling would send me to the back of the queue. There were no medically trained staff in the building but the baby was coming now so I pretended a confidence I didn't have and stayed with him through the labour, giving him every bit of advice I could remember from documentaries and dramas and friends who had been through it. Literally *minutes* later-\n\n\n\nHim- 'It's comingit'scomingit'scoming oh christ'\n\n\n\nMe- (making a pretty convincing stab at not being a clueless teenager) 'Ok James, well you need to be ready and there to take hold of the baby. I want you to put your phone on speaker...'\n\n\n\nThere was a clatter as the phone was dropped. James' wife (Simone, I think) had given a few last huge pushes and their son was delivered into the hands of his father, slippery and wriggling. I was still on the line- understandably I was forgotten in that incredible moment- and I could hear the parents exclaiming over their brand new child. After a few minutes the ambulance answered and I filled them in on what had happened. I managed to get James' attention by buzzing the line, and passed him over to the operator.\n\n\n\nSo that was the night I learned two things- a) what precipitate labour is and b) my bullshitting skills really are pretty advanced.\n\n\n\nI'd like to point out that in no way am I a hero in this piece. I didn't really help him deliver the child- the labour was straightforward and anyone would know to not let a child drop onto a hard floor- but I think I gave him confidence by being there, and reassurance. I was very pleased that the ambulance operator called me before the end of my shift (bear in mind, I wouldn't have been easy to track down at all, we had 7 call centres at the time) to tell me that everyone was well and that I had the couple's eternal gratitude for helping them. I will never ever forget that night, not until customer service drives me beyond reason that is. ",

A minority of people will feign surprise when we ask for payment, and claim that they shouldn't have to pay, for a variety of reasons.\n\n\n\n\nEveryone uses fuel, so we get calls from every type of person. One that I find particularly exasperating is the person who lists a whole load of medical diagnoses in the first sentence before you even know who they are, always followed up by an expectation that I can reduce or waive their bill.\n\n\n\nThis particular man I spoke to last week was an excellent example of this. He rattled off a load of mental health conditions, and said that he shouldn't be expected to pay his bill. When I looked at his account I saw that he had been in collections for years, he'd been given more chances to pay than anyone I'd seen, so I was politely insistent that he needed to at least make a small payment.\n\n\n\nI will add at this point that I have worked for the NHS and the emergency services so I'm familiar with the kind of person who thinks that their medical condition absolves them from any personal responsibility. I may sound harsh but there are patients like this who will demand an ambulance every day of the week- over £2k to the taxpayer- they know they don't need them but they don't care.\n\n\n\nAnyway, eventually this exchange occurred-\n\n\n\nMan- 'Well... there's only one way now...'.\n\n\n\nMe- (with a sinking feeling I know exactly what he means but I need to clarify) 'What do you mean by that Mr. xxx?'\n\n\n\nMan- 'Well, I'll top myself. It'll be your fault. I'm not going to pay my bill, you can have me on your conscience' (This all said in the sort of disinterested tone that tells me he's done this many times)\n\n\n\nThen he hangs up. I asked a TM what to do, and she advised that I should report it. So I call 999 and explain. I reported the conversation as it happened, but I told the police operator that 'he may be known to you'- which is EA code for 'this guy's a nutter, I'd be amazed if he doesn't pester you on the regular.'.\n\n\n\nI was told they'd do a welfare check, and I have to say that the idea of the police turning up on his doorstep and tearing him off a strip does make me happy.",

        "text": "**Background**\n\nThis one happened after I'd handed in my two weeks notice (yay!). I was working at a center in Ireland that does outsourced customer support for a UK telecommunications company with a yellow and cyan logo. Specifically, I was doing billing support for home phones and broadband, so I got to hear every sob story you've heard of; if everything I heard was true, England is populated entirely by disabled single parents of autistic children who live on benefits. I was also party to the occasional person in a genuinely desperate situation. This was neither.\n\n**Prologue**\n\nOn this particular day, there was some sort of technical issue going on. All our systems were working, just i n c c r e d i b l y   s l o w l y. Since God sees no reason reduce the number of bad things that happen when people who fix problems have issues of their own, people were calling in at the normal rate, which meant callers were commonly waiting on hold for upwards of 40 minutes. Oh, and somebody higher up, quite likely at the client, had decided there were too many people on broadband and had been gradually transferring people to mobile (who were, in fairness, perpetually understaffed). As such, on a normal day we had 0 green time. Zero. Nought. Náid. Zéro. Nada. Céro. So today was extra super-duper fun.\n\nIn mid-morning, a girl a couple of rows down got a clearly perplexing call. This guy wanted the client to make a donation to a charity that worked to restore sight to people who have lost theirs. A worthy and admirable request, but not one that was going to happen. Those of us who witnessed this chuckled and rolled our eyes. You speak to all sorts of people, working in a call center.\n\n**Main Story**\n\nIn early afternoon, I get yet another call, this time from a man who we'll call John Smith (not his real name). While we're swamped, the calls up to now have been straightforward, and people mostly understood that even the Internet providers can run into network issues.\n\n*Me:* Hi, you're through to Yellow and Cyan home broadband customer support! My name's Rhodoferax! How can I help you?\n\n*John:* Young man, do you known I've been waiting on hold for the last half hour?\n\n*Me:* Yes, I do apologise but we're having some technical issues today.\n\n*John:* Well I'm really not happy with having waited so long.\n\n*By this point I'd gotten the account up.*\n\n*Me:* Well hopefully we'll be able to resolve your issue quickly. Can I get your name please?\n\n*John:* John Smith.\n\n*Me:* Thank you, and just for the Data Protection Act can you tell me letters 2 and 6 of your mother's maiden name?\n\n*John:* No, I don't think that's necessary. (*Christ, he's one of those people. No issues are going to be resolved quickly*). You already have me open on your computer without me needing to give you any other information, so you know who I am.\n\n*Me:* Mr. Smith, this is a legal requirement to prevent fraud. I just need to confirm your identity.\n\n*John:* Tell me, how were you able to bring up my details without me telling you my number or address?\n\n*Me:* When you called in it showed the number you were calling off on my computer. I was able to search by that.\n\n*John:* So you can tell it's me because I'm phoning from my house.\n\n*Me:* Not necessarily. Without confirmation, all I know is that you're making a call from Mr. Smith's huse. For all I know you might be someone who broke in.\n\n*John:* Well how do I know you really work for Yellow and Cyan?\n\n*Me:* Because you called us.\n\n*John:* And yet you don't believe I'm calling from my own house. Tell you what, can you tell me your family name and then I'll believe you.\n\n*Me:* We're not supposed to give out our surnames due to some people getting stalked on social media. (*True*).\n\n*I don't clearly remember the next few minutes. There was a bit of back and forth which ended with us agreeing that I would hang up and call John right back. Like a fool, I did so. After some more 'discussion' as to the merits of the DPA, John calmly and quickly gave me the two letters of his mother's maiden name. This was 10 minutes after I'd first taken the all, and our AHT target was 8 min 30 s. Also, for some reason we didn't get ACW after any outbound calls, so I would have to scramble when this one drew to a close.*\n\n*Me:* Thank you. You know, if you'd just said that in the first place we wouldn't have had to go through all that rigmarole.\n\n*John:* No, that's wrong. I'm trying to introduce some integrity to Yellow and Cyan.\n\n(*Yes, he said we needed integrity and that's what he was trying to introduce. As an aside, this is why I liked DPA fails. I got to be full-on Lawful Neutral, since I had legal backing to tell people \"no\". Since I'm not good with common sense, it was always a relief to be able to rely entirely on logic.*)\n\n*Me:* ... Right. Anyway, Mr. Smith, how would you like me to help you?\n\n*John:* I'm not receiving the service I'm paying for. I waited over half an hour to talk to you. The thing is, when you get to my age, money doesn't really matter. What's important is doing good in the world, and that's what I'd like Yellow and Cyan to do. I support a charity called [charity name], and in light of this issue, I'd like you to make a donation of, say £15 to them.\n\n(*Woah, it's the guy that girl had earlier. While he's been saying this I've been reading the tickets and don't see any actual issues on his end.*)\n\n*Me:* OK, I'll see what I can do.\n\n*John:* When you say you'll see what you can do, that means you aren't going to do anything, right?\n\n(*Shit, this guy's sharp.*)\n\n*Me:* I'll be honest, Yellow and Cyan aren't going to agree to this, but tell you what. When I get home, I'll make a personal donation.\n\n(*I might have done it, too. The charity did sound worthwhile, and if it wasn't a scam that money might really have helped someone.*)\n\n*John:* Well that's a very kind offer, but I'm looking for a bit of integrity from Yellow and Cyan over this issue.\n\n*Me:* This issue... Mr. Smith, is the problem with your Internet?\n\n*John:* No, my Internet is fine.\n\n*Me:* Is your phone the issue?\n\n*John:* No, my phone has no problems, I'm speaking to you on it.\n\n*Me:* So wait a minute, the issue is how long you've been waiting?\n\n*John:* That's what I'm talking about.\n\n*Me:* So just to be clear, you called in at 1:30pm today to complain about how long it took your call of 1:30pm to be received? Is that the case?\n\n*John:* This is the service I'm paying for, and I'm not getting it. That's my I want you to compensate me by making a donation to [charity name].\n\n*Me:* Mr. Smith, I can't do that. First of all, comensation is to return money that was taken incorrectly, or taken in payment for a service that wasn't provided, it's not to harm Yellow and Cyan. Second, you yourself have confirmed that your phone and Internet are working fine, so you've brought this on yourself. You wouldn't have been waiting on the phone if you hadn't called in the first place, and none of this would have happened.\n\n*John disagreed, and ultimately asked to speak to a manager. I got the nearest TL on the phone and explained the 'situation' as best I could. The TL raised his eyebrows in a disbelieving gesture and took the call, which was now over 40 minutes in. As the conversation progressed, I could tell from my TL's body language precisely which conversational beats and topics John was bringing up again. At one point TL started explaining that the technical issues we were experiencing were an unpredictable one-off and it wasn't practical to always have enough people on the floor to meet a single day's unusual and unforeseeable demand. Still, the TL had immense patience and John ultimately hung up without getting any donations.*\n\n*TL:* That guy is not right in the head.\n\n**Afterword**\n\nI copied the account number to Notepad and checked it a couple of times later in the day out of curiosity. John didn't try phoning again.\n\nTyping this all up, it might look like he was trying to scam the company, considering some shits do set up fake charities to con people's goodwill. I don't think he was, because if that is what he was trying to do, he chose a *really* inefficient way of going about it. He'd have been better off standing on a street with a bucket and asking people for donations. I've done that for legitimate charities, and it does work.",

That makes no sense.\n\n\n\nMe: I'm asking you what you think we should be paying so I can compare it to what we are actually paying.\n\n\n\nLB: Uh.... *shuffling papers, typing on the computer, asking for his other employee by a name I recognize and asking him what it should be* ...XXX dollars.\n\n\nMe: Yes, this is starting to sound familiar, I believe I spoke to (employee) before and showed him how to get the form you need to change it. It's very simple and we can get it fixed very quickly.\n\n\n\nLB: Well, we aren't changing it. It's the same as it's always been.\n\n\n\nMe: I'm sure that's true, but as I explained to your employee, it appears we had the wrong information on the new contract and it was signed without anyone telling us it was wrong. It could have been adjusted during negotiations but since it wasn't and the contract was finalized we now require a form. \n\n\n\nLB: Well it was right before the new one! It added up perfectly at XX dollars so you had it right before and I don't understand why it changed. \n\n\n\nMe: *pulls old contract* That's odd.... We have the same incorrect tax rate on this one as well. I'm not sure how it all balanced out properly but since we know it's wrong now all we need is a form to change it.\n\n\n\nLB: BUT IT'S NOT CHANGING!!\n\n\n\nMe: We are *changing* it from the incorrect amount to the correct amount. We can't just adjust this stuff whenever anyone calls we need a formal request from your company to do this.\n\n\n\nLB: *long, heavy sigh* Can you email it to me?\n\n\n\nMe: No, sir, I cannot verify your identity over the phone so please log in to your account, print the form and send it back. I do not send forms that change billing or contract information for security reasons. Our way of verifying you is by having you log in to your account that only authorized employees should have access to and getting the form from there.\n\n\n\nLB: Can someone, like, just fill it out all the way and fax it to me so I can sign it and send it back?\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, with all due respect, that is literally the process you have gone through with your last two contracts and you did not read or verify that information before signing it. I'm asking you again to print the form, fill it out completely with the correct information, and send it to us. It's very simple, and it could have been done already if it had been sent this morning when I told (employee) how to do it.\n\n\n\nLB: *HUGE sigh and disconnects*\n\n\n\nBro, I am NOT going to do everything for you.

        "text": "Yesterday evening I received a call from a woman who'd been trying to get hold of her doctor because she was out of blood pressure meds. I explained to her that the doctor was transitioning into a different role and was only in every other week, so if she wanted to speak to the office she'd need to talk to the office during their shortened hours.\n\n\"Well, if he wants to be a hospitalist he should be on call for the people he is a doctor to!\"\n\nThat's... not how on calls work, not here at least, but there is another doctor who shares on call with her doctor. I offer to page him for her.\n\n\"What good is that going to do me?!?\"\n\n...maybe he can call in her prescription? I'm not totally clear on what she wants at this time, but I assumed it was her medication. I explain to her how the on-call thing works and tell her that I'm gonna page the doctor and if he doesn't get back with her in 30 min or so to call me back and I'll try to reach him on his phone.\n\nNever heard back from her, so I assumed the on-call had taken care of it.\n\nFast forward to tonight... phone rings again, who could it be but an extremely irate woman who didn't! get! her blood pressure! medication! yesterday!\n\nI offer, again, to page the on-call doctor. Again she asks, what good will that do?\n\n\"All the pharmacies are closed!\"\n\n(It's maybe five-thirty at this point.)\n\nI ask her what she would like me to do. I can page the doctor but if she doesn't want that I can leave a message for the office but they won't get it until Monday because it is, after all, 5:30 on a Friday night. She huffs and puffs and finally decides, well, maybe she'll have the doctor call her script in to Walmart (they are open until 9:00 on Fridays).\n\nI tell her okay, I will page the doctor, and make sure this time to emphasize if she doesn't hear from the doctor in thirty minutes to call me back and I will reach him by phone so she can get her script.\n\nTwo hours later, she calls me back to yell at me that the doctor hadn't called her, that she was pissed with her doctor for not being on call when she needed stuff, for being on BP meds when she didn't want to be on BP meds, and as I offered to call the doctor and connect him through to her she yelled, \"Tell Dr. (her doctor) I said thanks a lot!\" and hung up.\n\nThe call center I work for is going out of business, so I'm finding this one more amusing than frustrating at the moment, but I can help but feel that between not following simple follow-up instructions and in fact refusing to follow up at all the first day she really wanted to be the wronged party in all this.",

I was working in a UK bank call centre and an American man called in, a fussy type, making me confirm things three times, testing me almost. I was on the call for sometime and had managed to win his confidence, and at the end he said 'Thank you... sorry, what was your name again?' 'Female name' I said. \nThat was a mistake. \n\n\nCust- 'Female name?, FEMALE NAME?' \n\nMe- '...Yes, female name'\n\nCust- 'I don't believe you. Is this a JOKE? What sort of a cock-a-mamie (literally the only time I have heard that word spoken in person) set up do you have over there?\n\nMe- 'Mr x, I happen to have a deep voice, I'm a woman, I promise. Maybe if I could get one of my colleagues on the line to confirm...\n\nCust- 'How do I know who you have there, in on your scheme? (literally heavy breathing by this point) I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER'\n\n\nAt this point I gave in and transferred the call to a manager, and I heard her *actually apologise* to him because someone in a call centre on the other side of the Atlantic didn't sound exactly as he'd imagined they would.

Thanks for the quick fix. Where is your call center located at?\n\nMe: Idaho, sir. It’s quite lovely in the summer if you ever decided to take a trip. \n\nCustomer: if you can’t tell me, you don’t have to lie. \n\nMe, baffled: sir? I’ve lived in Idaho my whole life. I’m so Idahoan, I had a bear break into my house\n\n(true story by the way)\n\nCustomer: you work for the government. \n\nMe: I’m employed by (company)\n\nCustomer: no, you’re not. You work for the government. Idaho doesn’t exist. Its a cover-up. They just want you to think it exists with real people and real things so they can cover up whatever they are doing up there. \n\nMe *internally*: Yes, I, a government employee, have nothing better to do than fix your television. You’re welcome...\nMe *externally*: ah, okay. \n\nCustomer *sounding skeptical*: Well since you fixed my problem (my name) from I.Da.Ho, I’ll let you get back to working for (company)...if that’s who I’m really talking to. \n\nApparently that wasn’t the first or last time my coworkers and I dealt with the government conspiracy about Idaho. \n\nA coworker got one where a customer wouldn’t eat Idaho potatoes because they were genetically modified by the government to dumb us down and Idaho is just added to maps to cover up the fact that these potatoes were “built” in a factory. But the Californian ones where fine to eat. \n\nWake up, you SHEEPLE!!!\n\nEdit: story time, ladies and gents. \n\nI’m a full-grown adult, and live down “in the valley” now but still love going up to my dad’s house as often as I can. Something about no people makes it very very appealing. Anyways, I follow my dad up the mountain one day, as he works in the valley. We get up there and the back door is open. Both dad and I carry heat. You have to carry something up there especially in the summer because you run into rattlesnake EVERYWHERE. Anyways we go in not entire sure what to expect. The mud room is a mess, the bottles of detergent, paint thinner, bleach are busted open on the ground, shelves are knocked over, just a mess. Just beyond the mud room is the kitchen, we walk in there and nothing is amiss. I take upstairs, he takes downstairs, it’s all clear.  Dad goes and pulls his security footage and out culprit is a black bear. I don’t know why he didn’t walk the extra 5 feet to the good stuff in the kitchen. We found some bear skat while hiking just above the house that looked like he may have had some of those chemicals he broke open, or it was another bear with a real bad case of the runs. \n\nEdit 2: I don’t spell so goods.

The blind leading the blind.\n\nSo far it's been 33 minutes and I don't see an end in sight.\n\nSomeone send help.\n\nEDIT: formatting and adding EDIT.\n\nUPDATE: So it took 55 minutes of repeating myself that I know nothing of Facebook and can't help her before she begrudgingly allowed me off the phone. Luckily, it was my last call, so I got some OT dealing with OL.\n\nI definitely need to find an escape route if things get repetitive and long. \n\nOh! I forgot to add. The reason she wanted to get on Facebook: it was her birthday yesterday and she knows she's got messages. I bet they all said \"Happy Birthday!!\"",

I started as a support advisor, before moving into Quality Assurance. This story happened once while I was listening to another advisor for evaluation. \n\n\nC: customer\n\nA: advisor\n\n\n&gt; C: whenever I take a photo with my [tablet], the photos stay for a while and then disappear. Is there anyway to save them somehow?\n\n\nMe and the advisor looked at each other with WTF-faces; this should not be happening, and we had never heard of this being an issue before. \n\n\nThe advisor probed a bit about how the customer usually used the device. We quickly determined that the customer was an older gentleman with less than stellar technical skills. \n\n\n&gt; C: well, there are 3 things you can do with a [tablet] right? You swipe left for camera, right for calendar and down to see the date and time.\n\n\nAt this point I had a sinking feeling that I knew exactly what the issue was, though I must admit I had never had this come up before in a call. While the advisor (who was fairly new and didn’t quite understand what the issue was just yet) asked for clarifying questions, I was hastily typing down a script for them on my laptop. Well, I say script. It was mainly “ASK THEM ABOUT THE BUTTON!”\n\n\n&gt; A: ... “sir, what happens if you press the rounded button on the front on the device?”\n\n\nWe heard a gasp.\n\n\nTurns out the customer didn’t know that you could *unlock* a [tablet], and had only ever used what could be accessed through the lock-screen. This is why he thought images disappeared after a while. \n\n\nWe swiftly guided him to the photo-app, and all the hundreds of photos he had taken and thought he had lost was there, just waiting for him to unlock the device.\n\n\nI like to think that we blew his mind.",

I work at a non-profit that raises money for a certain disease. \n\nYesterday, a lady called and was immediately demanding. \n\nHer: do you have higher ups?\nMe: yes, of course, in all departments. What is this in regards to? \nHer: I need to talk to someone higher up.\nMe: ????\nHer: do you have a president/ceo?\nMe: yes, but he’s out of the country. Would you like to talk to his assistant?\n\nI put her on hold and start to call his assistant. I realized I didn’t actually find out what she needs. So I hang up with the assistant and asked the lady. She said she needed the phone number for the “National [disease] Council.” I google it and immediately recognize it at as a scam because I’ve had a few calls months before like this. I asked her if she received something from them. She said yes, and that she won a sweepstake for $10,000 from the council because she donates to us, and can’t get a number to call them. (Why our president was the only one she could get the number from was behind me.) I apologize to her and let her know it is in fact a scam, and we do not do sweepstakes. I tell her the council is fake, and we have zero affiliation with them. \n\nShe got even more mad. She started blaming us for being affiliated with them. I tried explaining we are in no way affiliated with them, we just have similar names. She replied “yeah, and that’s your fault for sharing similar names.” I told her it’s a disease, no one owns that name, and anyone can use it in their name. She absolutely refused to agree to this, and said she’ll no longer donate to us, and will tell all her friends the same thing. \n\nI felt bad for her, but just a little.",

It's one of my favorites, and I hope that y'all can appreciate it.\n\n\nA little background - I work at a tech startup doing customer service. The company very recently started taking phone calls for support questions, and it has been an experience to say the least. Most of the calls are easy enough, but they are usually back-to-back and sometimes can be complicated or involve an angry customer; so as you can imagine, it is a little stressful, especially considering that most of the associates taking calls received little and quick training and had spent a year or more only writing emails. To cope with the stress, we all do different things to deal or otherwise vent to each other when we're feeling particularly burnt out. What my coworker likes to do is press the mute button on their phone and say things to us while the customer keeps talking. They have a knack for it and never really had any slip-ups (because obviously this is super risky) until this little gem of a conversation happened.\n\n\nWe will refer to my coworker as CW. We will call the customer CX.\n\n&gt; CW: [finishing up a pay-related issue] Is there anything else that I can help you with?\n\n&gt; CX: No, no; you've been a great help! I want you to know how happy we are to finally be able to call in with issues. This is much faster than email.\n\n&gt; CW: We get that a lot. We're glad we can be there for you. If there's anything else that we can do for you, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!\n\nMy coworker thinks that the customer has hung up and doesn't hit their mute button.\n\n&gt; CW: I'm going to die here, occultcake.\n\n&gt; CX: ...Don't die, CW; we need you.\n\n&gt; CW: ...Thank you! Have a great rest of your day!\n\n\nAnd that was the day that my coworker started remembering to hang up the phone and/or not use the mute button.",

        "text": "It's probably something you eventually hear working in a call center. You get a customer who has a problem and after helping them with it they go on about how valuable their time is because they are a (insert profession) and they make $x.xx per minute so you owe them for them having to call you. Well here is my recent one.\n\nQuick intro. I work for website support for my company. Field of business is irrelevant for this particular story, but suffice to say you can manage your account with us on our website after registration. I'm not great at the line by line dialogue format of story telling so I'm going to do this in paragraph form.\n\nCustomer pops into my line. We've been having a large call volume so he has been waiting for me about 30ish minutes. A fact that he let's me know right off the bat and expounds upon for a good 2 to 3 minutes explaining how that must mean we are all incompetent and our company sucks. After his initial monologue I finally get the \"how can I help you\" offer out and a \"sorry about the wait time\".\n\nCustomer goes into another long monologue about how terrible our website is to use and he can't get registered. He let's me know how he works in a tech field, setting up networks and physical computer infastructure or whatever. I'm honestly tuning him out at this point because I've already looked up his account by the caller ID and see what his problem is and his irrelevant ranting is just delaying things.\n\nFinally he finishes, I finally get to the \"sorry to hear about that\" and ask for the account details so I can help part. Again, I already know what the problem is so as soon as he verifies I quickly start talking before he can go off on another tangent. So the reason he couldn't get registered is because he wasn't validating the email he used during registration. Anyone who has ever registered for any type of online account knows this step of the process. You filled out all your info and it tells you some variation of \"check your email and click the link to validate the account\". Well he isn't doing it. He just keeps trying to login with the info he filled out the form with. Now when you do that and the account is just missing the email validation it will tell you that's why you can't login and offer to resend it. Normally for people with this problem if I feel like walking them through their mistake I'll ask them to try to login and read me that screen. It usually takes all frustration with my company away from them when they realize it was their mistake. Not this guy though. I knew I just needed him off the phone as quick as possible.\n\nSo I tell him his mistake and he seems to calm down and back off. Then he starts in with that dreaded \"well you know I work from home and my hourly rate is $x.xx, so with the hold time and amount of time it took with you, your company owes me $x.xx\". He asks who does he talk to about getting compensation for his time. I tell him flatly that it doesn't work like that and he won't be be compensated. I don't dress it up at all. He immediately ramps back up to full indignant customer again. He demands again for payment after another monologue and I refuse again. The next part goes like this:\n\nCustomer: you're company is going to pay me\n\nMe: No sir\n\nC: I will get paid for my time!\n\nM: no sir\n\nC: I demand that I get paid for this!\n\nM: no sir\n\nC: stop saying \"no sir\"!!!\n\nM: my apologies sir. You won't get paid for this call\n\nC: supervisor!!!\n\nI explain to him calmly that I am a supervisor (we're allowed to say this) and that he won't get compensated still. He demands someone above me and I accept to transfer him but I let him know that no one will compensate him.\n\nCustomer suddenly gets calm. I'm a little weirded out with the sudden change of tone but whatever. He says he accepts not getting compensation but since I am on the line, I have to help him with another problem. I agree to help with anything on the account I can. He says before he gets into he needs to put me on hold for a second and move to another room. I already know where this is going but I agree because I have to. His side of the line goes silent and I start watching the clock. We have a hang up rule for abandoned calls but this guy is \"smart\" and checks in every minute or so with \"are you still there? Just give me another minute,\". \n\nFinally after 25ish minutes of this, he comes back on the line and explains to me that the time he has wasted speaking to us is now even with the time he has kept me tied up on hold and he considers us even now. He says it in such a smug satisfied voice like he pulled one over on me. I just start my \"yes sir, is there anything else I can help with?\" line but he hangs up on me.\n\nOur department isn't very focused on call stats, so I don't have to care about my AHT, so while this guy thinks he punished me and my company, he really just gave me another break for the day since all I did was browse Reddit on my phone while he kept me on hold. Congratulations random asshole, you did nothing.\n\n",

I checked his background, he's in his mid 20s, has an MBA from an English university, worked a couple of years in England as an accountant, has a fair bit of savings and a relatively profitable online business. I thought he would be a reasonable person since he doesn't need his money urgently. Wrong.\n\nI needed some verification, so I asked him to send them to my office. Two weeks later, it did not arrive. The customer was irate because he thought that I lost his confidential documents.\n\nIn the beginning of the call, he spoke in a posh accent but it turned into a Belfast one the moment he got mad.\n\nC= customer\n\nMe: \"Hi Mr. C, I am afraid that I haven't received your documents.\"\n\nC: \"I have sent it two weeks ago. How could you lose it? It has confidential information.\"\n\nMe: \"I did not lose it, I just didn't receive it.\"\n\nC: \"I will send you a second copy, but I will be talking to my lawyer and the police about this. I have a recording of the call and I will use it against you. You better find it or else. \n\nIf you stupid Paki (I'm not even Pakistani or Indian) fookin dare to stand between me and my money, I know people in the paramilitary all over Norn Iron. I know your name and I know where you work. Mark my words.\" *Slams down phone*\n\nA week later, the second copy of verification arrived, with a letter threatening to sue me and report me to the police for identity fraud if I do not return his call within 30 days. I searched the office high and low, and I finally managed to find the first set, which was filed away by mistake.\n\nI tried to call him and he blocked my number. Great. I had to escalate it to my manager, who had to argue with him that losing confidential documents is not the same as identity fraud. I would need to actively pretend to be him order to be considered identity fraud. \n\nApparently he called her a fenian because she has an Irish last name and was complaining that the Irish and foreigners are infiltrating the British government. After a long rant about Republicans, he agreed to drop charges. My manager told me that guy *might* have a mental problem. He is now on the black list.\n\nI got the last laugh: Turns out he wasn't entitled to any money because his income exceeds the limit.",

I shouldn't have to wait this long to be paid!\n\n\n\nMe: We have to give the company time to respond to the bill just like we give you time to bill us. \n\n\n\nC: So?

She'll call you back as soon as she can, but there is no one here who can expedite this for you. You will have to wait a little longer for payment.\n\n\n\nC: NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

What's wrong with you, why can't you just say it clearly? They shouldn't hire people who stutter and can't-\n\n\n\nI hit the release button and sent my boss a message explaining what happened, and that I am not paid to sit on the phone and be personally insulted. I said what I had to say, he wanted to to keep arguing and get personal, the conversation was not going anywhere so I hung up. My boss agreed 100%, called him and said the same thing I did. Apparently he was much nicer on the supervisor call (surprise). Honestly I wish I had sent it to my boss's voicemail instead of hanging up, but he annoyed me enough that I just hit it without even really thinking and went to the next call. \n\n\n\nHappy Friday, everyone! :) ",

        "text": "I was thinking of making a throwaway for this but screw it. Plus, am on a mobile, sorry.\n\nI used to work in a call centre for a famous luxury travel company. All of our training was about drilling into us how we had to bend over backwards for the customer. We were told that customers were paying for the experience and that included us in the call centre. If they wanted to know the exact measurements of the drawers in their room, or how many coat hangers there would be, we would be expected to find out. We were even told customers would phone just to chat about their previous vacations.\n\nAll fine and good. I’m up for that. It all sounds nice and civil.\n\nThen we go up onto the floor and answering the phones and shit gets real. Turns out our line managers quickly let us know that our job was to answer the phone and get shot of the caller ASAP. If the caller wasn’t buying a holiday from us we were to get rid of them even faster. People with legitimate problems would call and they wouldn’t lift a finger to help us find solutions. It was beyond frustrating. I actually had my line manager hit the disconnect on calls that she thought went on too long.\n\nCue my phone call from a lovely old lady called Mrs H.\n\nMrs H phones and asks if she can postpone her holiday for one year. Her husband has just been diagnosed with bone cancer. He’s going to get treatment and so they can’t go, but she wants to book the holiday for next year as something to look forward to. \n\nI open up her information and find that it’s a few days into the period of time that cancellations can’t be made without us taking a bunch of money off them. In this case over $10,000. I can’t cancel it without a code being entered, which only line managers have.\n\nSo I go to my line manager and ask her if we can help them. She says bluntly: ‘No, tell them to claim it on their insurance.’\n\nI go back to lovely Mrs H and tell her (making sure she knew it was my line manager being an asshole and not me) that she had to claim it on her insurance. Mrs H thanks me and goes away.\n\nNext day Mrs H calls and asks to be put through to me. She says her insurance won’t cover it because even though her husband didn’t know he had bone cancer when they booked the holiday, they said it was a pre existing condition for it to be so bad now. \n\nI go back to line manager to beg again for her to input the code to postpone the vacation.\n\nLine manager doesn’t give a shit about lovely Mrs H. She says: ‘Tell her she should have bought better insurance then.’\n\nI go back to Mrs H and relay this shitty response. Mrs H is a sweetheart and says their insurance is with our company. So I go back to my line manager who shrugs and goes about her day.\n\nSo I concoct a plan. I go back to lovely Mrs H and I say: ‘Listen Mrs H. I can look pretty cute when I make an effort. If you can phone back when my line manager is in a meeting or on a break, I can go over and ask another line manager who’s got a bit of an eye for me and doesn’t know about your case and hopefully get him to input his code.’\n\nMrs H is very grateful. She phones up the next day and I whisper: Not yet Mrs H, my line manager is here.\n\nMrs H phones up the next day and I whisper, ‘Try again tomorrow Mrs H, there’s no meeting for my line manager today.\n\nFinally after a few days of this, Mrs H phones up, she’s been an absolute sweetie every call, and my line manager happens to be in a meeting. So I say, let’s go for it Mrs H. \nI pretty myself up a bit. ‘I’m putting my lipstick on now Mrs H.’ And I walk over to the male line manager on the next team and I say ‘Ohh you have to help, I’ve just booked a holiday for a customer but I got the dates wrong and I meant to book it for next year and it’s within the final 90 days so can you input your code because I screwed up?’\n\nMale line manager (who is a nice guy) comes over and I stand holding the computer monitor, hopefully not suspiciously, in a way that blocks him from seeing the date it was purchased. And he inputs the code, laughing at me for being a bit dizzy and getting the year wrong. Then goes back to his team.\n\nI did it!\n\nCue me back on the phone whispering: ‘The Eagle has landed Mrs H! We’ve done it!’\n\nMrs H was over the moon. I get her all booked in for the following year and send her on her way with all my love for Mr H and herself.\n\nNext day there’s a lovely card mailed into the call centre for me with a big thank you and an invitation to come to their house any time I’m in their part of the country. In fact, we’ve exchanged Christmas cards ever since.\n\nI hated that damn job and I’m well out of it now, but I like to think that the daily hell of it was all worth it, just to be able to make a difference to sweet Mrs H.\n\n",

        "text": "So, my credit card got locked because of suspected fraud. When I called in, I was chatting with the lady explaining how I myself work in a call center and it's interesting the parallels in policy they have between call centers. She told me that I was one of the nicest people she had call in. I know the feeling of how frustrating it can be to have somebody yell at you for something that's not your fault. Since she was very friendly and nice, I had her transfer me up to her supervisor for a compliment. At my call center, if a client wants to give a compliment, they usually give out a treat or something as a reward. I hope my call did just that. ",

I was quoted for $2100 but now they are saying it is $4600.\n\nM: Okay, what is your reference number and I will look into it.\n\nAC: Gives me reference number.\n\nM: Yes Sir, it looks like your reservation was for 7 feet of trailer space. You ended up using the full 28 foot trailer. You need to pay for the full trailer.\n\nAC: But noone told me or my son that we would have to pay for what we use.\n\nM: Sir, you, or your son, booked this all online. You never talked to anyone.\n\nAC: Well isn't that convenient for you to quote 7 feet but end up charging us for the 28?!\n\nM: I'm sorry Sir, but that is exactly how our service works. You just pay for the amount of space you use.\n\nAC: Well I own \"blah blah\" business and I will smear your company for this. So what, I pay the $4600 and you will get my stuff to me in like 2-3 months?!\n\nM: No Sir, when this was booked a guaranteed delivery date was booked with it. It will be at your location on (said date).\n\nAC: Well if it there by the f******* (date) then so help me God I will burn your f******* company to the ground.\n\nCustomer disconnects....\n\n\nOkay there buddy.",

So I work for a financial institution in Canada and usually do outbound calling but for the last couple days we've been helping out our inbound team.\n\nA woman came through to me and I saw her language preference was french. Canada is officially bilingual and we do have french reps and I am definitely not one of them. \n\nThis woman probably just pressed random buttons in the IVR to get to a rep and didn't pay attention to the option for french.\n\nShe was speaking English to me and there didn't seem to be much of a language barrier--at first.\n\nShe wanted to go over stuff on her statement. Ok, I access it and see it's all in french. I offer to get her over to a french rep. She keeps asking for info and going on about a specific charge. \n\nI told her at least three times I cannot read the statement and she ignored me each time and kept talking.\n\nFinally when I mentioned for the fourth time I cannot read her statement because it's. In. French. she finally listened and let me transfer her to a french rep.",

(pull up notes) Looks like they said it was illegible or blank. I'll pull up the fax to see what's going on.\n\n\n\n40 blank pages.\n\n\n\nMe: Unfortunately it appears that someone may have faxed the pages upside down, or something could be wrong with your fax machine. All the pages are blank, all we can see is that it came from your business name and fax number. \n\n\n\nC: Or something is wrong with YOUR fax.\n\n\n\nMe: Well, that's always possible, but we receive hundreds of faxes a day and yours is the only one I've seen like this today. I really think it was just upside down, no biggie, would you please resend it the other way? If it's still blank we'll try another way but let's do this first just to make sure.\n\n\n\nC: *sigh* Fine, what were the dates on the invoices?\n\n\n\nMe: I can't see anything, so I'm not sure, ma'am.\n\n\n\nC: Well then why does the notice say the 2nd??\n\n\n\nMe: That's the date we received and tried to process your fax, the pages are literally blank, like just white pages. We don't have any more information.\n\n\n\nC: We put everything back after we faxed it, I don't remember everything that went into that fax!\n\n\n\nMe: Well, all I can suggest is that when you can find the ones you sent last week, I'd keep them out and set aside in case this issue happens again.\n\n\n\nC: FINE, I guess I'll have to go through ALL of this paperwork AGAIN and resend it.\n\n\n\nMe: I guess you will.\n\n\n\n\nC: Yeah, THANKS A LOT. *click*\n\n\n\nEven when you send faxes upside down, I'm the asshole. :(",

He was telling me about some trivial issues and that he spoke with someone in the customer service departments who was able to help. I looked him up in the system to see how it all went. It seems that he was \"an irate\" who was \"demanding\" and was persistently asking to speak with the president of the company. He wanted his money back and for then to send him a new product. They had to go through various supervisors to satisfy his request. He didn't get a new product for free, but he got an even sweeter discount. ",
