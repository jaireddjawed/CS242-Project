There is fusion and fission research in nuclear engineering, and every time he writes something he always capitalizes Fusion as it is capitalized on the college website.

Why should it be marked down in academic writing when the difference is insignificant? It begs the bigger problem with English and language generally: it is subjective.

If I have failed to notice any relevant guidelines, my apologies.\n\nFor me, \"thereby\" does not work in the following two sentences:\n\n\"He contaminated the samples. ________, they are unusable.\"\n\n\"We completed the first round of analysis last week and are ________ moving on to round 2 today.\"\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, \"thereby\" means \"by that\" or \"by that means\".  According to the Cambridge Dictionary, it means \"as a result of this action\".\n\nI am struggling to explain why thereby cannot be used in the first sentence.  The rather similar adverb \"thus\" looks fine: \"He contaminated the samples.  Thus, they are unusable.\" But \"thereby\" looks weird to me, and I can't work out why.  After all, one of its meanings is \"as a result of this action\", and the second example would make sense if it said \"He contaminated the samples.  As a result of this action, they are unusable.\" Verbose, but not wrong as far as I can tell. So why does \"thereby\" look so odd?\n\nI initially thought perhaps \"thereby\" had to be followed by a participle, but I can find plenty of examples where it isn't.\n\nFor the second sentence, my question is a little different.  Saying \"We completed the first round of analysis last week and are as a result of this action moving on to round 2 today\" does look unnatural to me, justifying the non-use of \"thereby\"; \"We completed the first round of analysis last week and are as a result moving on to round 2 today\" looks more suitable.  But why do the words \"of this action\" look out of place here?  Completing the first round of analysis does, at first glance, appear to be an action.\n\nAny thoughts will be gratefully received.",

One of the key changes over this decade is the transition from conventional televisions to flat-screens, with the former falling from 34% to 4% and the latter rising from 8% to 27% for the period, making it the number one television device. The latter has replaced the former as the most popular TV viewing device.\n\nAnother general trend is that younger people are now watching television on smaller, more portable devices than in 2009. **In particular, the use of mobile phones and tablets for viewing purposes has increased by almost three quarters to 26% and tablet use seeing an almost four-fold increase to 19%.** This trend is reinforced by the number of 18 to 25-year-olds using computers for the TV viewing. Both desktop and laptop computers saw substantial falls in usage (around a third for both).\n\nOverall then, it can be said that the two pie charts suggest the TV viewing habits in Canada over the period saw a move away from older devices and towards more modern equivalents.\n\n[https://www.ielts-writing.info/EXAM/academic\\_writing\\_samples\\_task\\_1/1111/](https://www.ielts-writing.info/EXAM/academic_writing_samples_task_1/1111/)",

So culturally, shorthand and small mistakes are overlooked because they are less important than getting your point across quickly. This seemed to be true in some communications prior to the internet as well.\n\nBut as an anecdote, the other day the marketing team at my work previewed an ad and it had an incorrect apostrophe in the wording. I pointed it out and two people seemed unsure if it was actually a mistake. Is it becoming a grammatical rule that is fading from common knowledge?",
