They would make unnecessary noises, they would hit the walls for fun, next to my head where i'm at my laptop.

I didn't think much of the effect they cause, from  goosebumps to fight-or-flight response that i face every single day. Not to mention that i also experience a horrible event where your landlord would watch you at day while you are sleeping undressed, and your landlord can visit every time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it affects the way i think, the way i control the paradigm. I was always trying to be normal and i dont want to lose it. That's all i care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd i don't want to spend more of my times on being furious and paying attention to those things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also just realized that looking for a job in my country is far harder than the others, espescially when i dont have degree. I just tried to searching for work online such as data entry and it's just zero sum in the end. Just the same thing happened a month, half year, and a year ago. So it's not possible to move. And it won't be easy to try to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt might could be better if the walls are separated within space, but hold on that's not how reality works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat i want is just as simple as being able to read books comfortably at night, retrying to study stuff from the past, taking some time to grief after embracing such a painful failure and more failure and just live.",

        "text": "I recently moved from India to Dublin. I had observed that most people from my country that I know do not make any attempts to socialize with people who are not from India (also observed the same pattern in people from other nationalities).\n\nI have always loved learning about various cultures and decided to make conscious effort to make friends with people from all places. And also to integrate with the locals. I do find the local culture, mannerisms, fascinating and would love to interact with the people on a more serious level.\n\nI love living in Dublin, have joined plenty of groups. There is a sports group, a book club, some art clubs, and have also become a regular at various meetups.\n\nI have gotten tonnes of phone numbers (from both men and women), and I would say have made a few friends as well. I fit in quite well even. However, I am yet to form any close friendships with anyone! Example: I am invited to sports events, or a group hike, or the pub with a bunch of people. But never invited to someone's home, or on a 1-1 brunch or dinner. (Basically, tonnes of nice surface level friendships, but nothing too deep). At this stage, I can't ask anyone here for a 1-1 dinner either. \n\nMy question is, how do I become better (close) friends with people? \n\nI feel like if I keep living here, I will absorb the various traits of the locals and seem less and less like a foreigner and would integrate better.\n\nHow long does such a process take? Is 4 months way too less for something like this?\n\n**Things that I have been doing correctly:**\n\n* I go out and do plenty of activities I genuinely enjoy, and I go with the intention to enjoy the activity and not just to meet people or hit on women. Like my sports club, or the gym, etc\n* I take care of my hygiene. Cleaning my clothes often, always using deodorants/perfumes etc.\n* I am very polite. Always thank people for hosting an event, or for inviting me etc. I speak very clear English, as I grew up speaking English. Have also picked up phrases in other European languages.\n\n**Things that I am planning to do:**\n\n* Volunteer\n* Joining a local college for evening classes.\n\n**Things I have not been doing correctly**\n\n* I rarely invite any of my casual friends to my home, or ask them for a 1-1 lunch or something. Maybe I could start doing that.\n* I don't have a lot of nice pictures of myself, so with the few pictures that I have, Bumble etc have not worked out at all.",

The close friends I had back home, we could talk for days and I would not get bored. We never go beyond talking about surface level stuff like school, family, whatever is going on, because we just have nothing in common. I figured out why socialising was always so tiring and not so rewarding - it‚Äôs because I was too worried about whether the person liked me that I didn‚Äôt even consider whether or not I liked the person.\n\nI am an introvert. But I enjoy socializing, in a lowkey manner. Like watching movies together, playing games, doing something that doesn‚Äôt require heavy socializing. I never meet people I click with. I can‚Äôt seem to click with anyone. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing something wrong or I‚Äôm just not meeting the right people, but I‚Äôm sick of it.

This feeling just stops me from concentrating on anything or doing anything productive during that time, and in effect makes my life harder so I want to get rid of it. However, it's not really his fault anymore and I still really want to remain friends with him. How do I do that without being so emotionally attached? Thanks for any advice.",

Besides gym class, I'm not really talkative at all and just mind my own business and I feel it's hurting the impression or assumptions people may have about me.\n\nIt doesn't help that I also have somewhat low confidence in public situations, social anxiety, and below average looks. The reason I feel this way is because people are always hesitant to interact with me (besides my friends and gym bro's), whether I initiate or not. The things that played into this was that whenever the class is told to be partners or groups, even if they are alone they don't wanna be partnered with me.\n\nOr how today I was holding the door open for a girl and she just stopped and let me through. Then I overheard her a second later say \"The f*ck was that\" and laugh. \n\nOr how someone I know never ever initiates conversation or accepts invitations to things but never participates. I feel though that this was warranted because I'd always get suggested their Instagram account but never knew them. Then once I actually met them I followed them. I feel like this makes me seem like a creep and stalker. The signs are there it seems: they take literal days to respond, and they've removed their profile picture and posts ever since.\n\n\nDo you have any ideas as to why people are uncomfortable around me? Is it their lack of information about me? Am I THAT ugly? Idk \n\nTLDR: Why might people feel uncomfortable around me even though I don't talk and mind my own business?",

        "text": "There's a mystery when it comes to why some people are social, outgoing, confident, and can freely express themselves... and why some people are shy, reserved, quiet, unconfident in themselves, or struggle to make deep connections.\n\nIf you're someone who has resigned to the idea of making more friends, or you don't really want to put in the work to improve your social life, then this post is not for you.\n\nHowever, if you're someone who likes to be around other human beings, you WANT to interact with them, have a good time with friends and make meaningful connections; and most importantly, you want to make people HAPPY, and you want to HELP people and contribute to their lives...\n\n‚Ä¶but you feel like you're awkward, or you don't have anything to offer, or you don't really know how to get past the small talk and really connect on a deeper level‚Ä¶\n\nIf you're one of these people, then I want to break this myth people have about their social skills once and for all; the big mystery about our abilities to be truly social and confident.\n\nMost people have this idea that someone just IS a certain way. Almost like they were BORN outgoing, or BORN more quiet and reserved. They'll say things like: \"I'm just a quiet person,\" or \"that's just not really me,\" as if their identity was set in stone because they were CREATED that way.\n\nBut the truth is, you've LEARNED to be a quiet person. You've LEARNED to be reserved. And someone who is outgoing LEARNED to be outgoing. We just LEARNED these things at a very young age. Often, without even KNOWING this learning was taking place at all.\n\nAnd yeah.‚Ä¶maybe it seems unfair. Just like it's unfair that some kids grow up learning two languages from their parents, while the rest of us weren't so lucky. They didn't have to necessarily work for it, they just happened to grow up in an environment where their parents spoke two different languages‚Ä¶\n\nAnd for everyone else that wants to be bilingual? They have to put in the work. They have to study. They have to find a teacher. They have to practice. They have to IMMERSE themselves.\n\nThis is EXACTLY the same with your social skills.\n\nYes, your upbringing has shaped it; and yes, you've had traumatic experiences that have shut you off from people and make it very difficult and scary to open up... you've experienced past failures that make rejection very painful‚Ä¶\n\n...but it didn't have anything to do with the way you were born or the structure of your DNA. You just happened to LEARN certain skills and to behave in particular ways.\n\nSo think about it‚Ä¶ if you wanted to travel to, say, Italy (maybe you wanted to live there!), and you really wanted to learn to speak Italian; but you weren't one of the lucky kids who was born with Italian-speaking parents‚Ä¶ do you just give up?\n\n\"That's not me. I'm one of those non-Italian speaking people. That's just the way I am.\"\n\nNo! That's ridiculous! You just have to LEARN.\n\nSo, what do you see here? You don't have to just settle for being the quiet, reserved, awkward person that you feel you are. You just have to learn that \"second language,\" learn that new way of being: the SKILL of being social and confident!\n\nThe good news? It can be much easier than learning a second language if you do it right.\n\nSo if you want to overcome these problems, be more social, and NOT be stuck the way you've learned to be, then let's continue this conversation. Comment with what specifically you'd like to learn how to do to transform your social life (or of course feel free to message me if it's too personal).",

        "text": "I am ( 22 F) a very social and easy to get along with person. I mainly grew up on video games so most of my Close friends were guys. When I got to college it was really easy to make friends, I was able to make so many cool friends (both guys and girls) but I noticed over the years that I would not know how to maintain my female friendships. I still have a few; but I'll get to that in a second. The problem was that my friendship circles eventually became mainly guys again, and it was a problem because... I'm not really \"one of the guys\" like they would eventually plan things just \"for the boys\" and I was obviously not invited. They would do this often and eventually I felt like I was drifting from them, I didn't know anything about their inside jokes during their hangouts, I was feeling completely left out, like none of them see me in the way I see them... which sucked. Feeling left out with the guys, my close friends, arguably my best friends at the time, was a real heartbreaker. So I thought about this time in my life again and decided that maybe I needed closer female friendships so that I never had to feel left out. Well at first it went well, I was spending holidays with them, we did a gift exchange, I was always invited to almost everything I could go to. But one day a few months before the pandemic, I found out that all my close female friends went to an amusement park without me. I was really upset and sad when I found out, but then I thought maybe they thought I was too busy (since I am pre med) and didn't invite me for that reason. But then it kept happening, one day they went to a beach house, and I was so upset and sad that I finally told them how I felt and they said that they were sorry and it was \"spur of the moment\". We made up and I honestly did see them doing more things without inviting me since then, but obviously I tried to treat it like a \"spur of the moment\" like they said. I want to believe them, and I know they love and care about me. But tonight was honestly the worst night for me. I texted one of my close gfs that I had some gifts for her birthday, that I really wanted to celebrate it with her and that I really really missed her. Then I texted my other best friend that we need to plan something for her bday but she almost kinda ignored my text about the bday and responded to something else I showed her. I thought it was weird but I tried to think nothing of it. Later that night, I was looking at our other friends Instagram and saw that they had all went to a vineyard together to celebrate the birthday. They were there all day today. And I didn't even know about it. These are my actual best friends, and I couldn't help but feel anger, sadness, and loneliness. And I want to text them and say how disappointed I am, and how I had wished I had received an invite but I just don't want to create drama on her birthday. It's not drama to me, it's honestly my feelings. I feel horrible, honestly. I wish I could have a single best friend that I know loved me wholeheartedly like I would love them. It's just so depressing. I value friendship so much and feel like I'm always feeling betrayed and hurt.",

You also need to understand that your friend most likely didn't mean it on purpose. They didn't intentionally want to cause you sadness. Don't take it so personally.\n\nAs an example (if you are interested) once a friend said something that hurt me quite a bit, but I pointed it out to them and they realised their mistake:\n\n*We were discussing jewellery and a friend told me that she remembers that I have a silver bracelet on my hand. I was surprised that she knew that. She later asked me what jewellery she wears and I didn't know and I got it wrong. She then says \"It just depends on how much someone cares\", implying that I don't care enough about her to remember what she wears. This instantly made me sad as I clearly do care about her and what she said isn't true. I pointed it out that what she said made me sad and she instantly realised her mistake. She explained to me that she wanted to say that SHE cares about ME, but it just came out wrong. I felt better now knowing that it was just a misunderstanding, and we were all good. She apologised and that was that. I didn't bottle up my feelings and I didn't get negative thoughts. It made me feel so much better.*\n\nTrust me, being honest will do God's work for your relationship!",

No judgement here, I was much the same not long ago. \n\nWell he invites me out...to a Meetup for people to mingle and get to meet new faces. We meet each other there and I feel a bit overwhelmed honestly. I talk to some people and even him a little. But he seemed more interested in meeting the others. I bowed out after maybe an hour. \n\nI guess it would've been nice to get to know him a little better one on one. Instead I feel a bit used - having a \"friend\" (using that term loosely) made him confident to seek out a social gathering. He doesn't reach out anymore and we just kind of give a friendly nod to each other around the office. \n\nHe still goes to those meetups and has met some cool people from the sound of it.

When you really don‚Äôt care what they think of you, it‚Äôs so much easier to let go and be yourself.

But because I‚Äôm happy with myself I don‚Äôt feel the need to change to fit in, or be who others want me to be, which is what I was referring to when I say I don‚Äôt care what others think.

They are both quite intense people who like to be honest and open about their feelings (and one of them has a 3 year old!!). Last week one of them called me rude for telling them that I wasn't up for having a chat whilst I was cooking... they are all about connection, authenticity etc... but it just tires me out to keep up with small talk/big talk all the time. I have told them this and they said they understand but I still feel almost afraid to go downstairs and deal with either 1) having a chat when I don't want to or 2) having to be awkward and express that I don't want to talk. Also, the kitchen has a small cooking area... there's only space for one person to do food prep at a time... I'm just tired and anxious so the thought of navigating any social situation right now feels like a lot.\n\nI really wish there was a way I could say hi and use the kitchen without engaging in a full on conversation but I worry this will seem rude or awkward. I'm sure I'm overthinking it but any advice for navigating this, or polite ways to say 'hi, not up for chatting, just here to cook' would be amazing",

The birds are just waking up, and I just woke up from a kind of habitual social anxiety nightmare where everyone I knew and cared about mistreated me, disregarded me, laughed at me. I was trying to deliver some object across some magical realist expanse, in a kind of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory environment, and met all these people in my life along the way. Their abuses and extraneous factors thwarted my mission to deliver the object over and over again. Often for many years now I have these dreams of social ostracization. While the people in the dreams and the interactions seem utterly real, the environment is always magical in some sense, which exacerbates the feeling of powerlessness and unknowability.\n\nI've made great strides in the realm of self love and self compassion recently. But in interpreting this dream tonight, I realize for the first time just how much being bullied as a young girl (I'm now a transgender man) shaped my current almost subliminal (so engrained they are hard to see) feelings of inferiority compared to others. THE DARKEST PART IS, these feelings of inferiority have had me act in people pleasing ways which actually do manifest in some people (who are maybe predisposed to bullying) seeing me as inferior, someone not as worthy of respect, someone to use, even if they feel this way only unconsciously. In any case, I am now taking responsibility for the role I have played in my own victimization. At the same time, I must work hard to develop self compassion insofar as realizing the bullying in the past did not happen because of any inherent deficiency within me. Back then, it really wasn't my fault. In learning to not blame myself for the past abuses, I hope I can take accountability for my own desires to be treated with respect today. Also, it is only a fraction of my friends and loved ones who treat me with this lack of respect. Most do. But the wound opened by these types of bullying people in my life have a disproportionate impact because I think another aspect of having been bullied is that I'm also inherently suspicious of people who claim to care about me, or my peers in general.",

For example, in one of my last college courses I sat next to a woman and we became casual acquaintances for the class, talking during down time, doing small group assignments, etc. She would talk to me about \"girlier\" things than any woman ever has with me. She would show me pictures of her boyfriend to show me how cute he is, which no woman has ever shown me before. Several times she brought up topics like makeup, skin care, hair care, as if I had a lot of experience with these things. All I do is take care of my hair but it seems to have a lot of implied baggage with it. \n\nShe never said anything outright (and maybe I'm just thinking way too hard about this) but she seemed so comfortable sharing these things and seemed so confident that I wasn't interested in her that I'm convinced she thought I was gay. For full context, I'm bi but wouldn't have mentioned that under any circumstance at the time. It just felt very different from my friendships with the opposite sex in the past. I've been wondering since, if she had known that I wasn't gay, would she have been as open with me or discussed the same topics? Would she have thought I wouldn't want to talk about hair, makeup, or her boyfriend if she thought I was straight?\n\nIt makes me a little uncomfortable how differently some strangers interact with me too. When I had short hair and looked like a traditional man, strangers just didn't talk to me, period. Now I have random people striking up conversations in public, I get compliments from women and men alike, which feels great ngl, but it seems like nobody was ever comfortable approaching me like that when I looked like everybody else. \n\nI just don't really understand why people would be treating me so differently and the only major difference I can think of is that maybe women think I'm gay and less likely to misinterpret their complements as a sexual advance? Or maybe people find a more feminine appearance more approachable just cause? Probably both? What do you think, random internet stranger?",
