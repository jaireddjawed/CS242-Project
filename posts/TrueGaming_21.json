        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/97c4d5/is_the_trolley_problem_tired_or_overused_in/",
        "text": "If you are unfamiliar with “the trolley problem,” essentially it asks if you would willingly sacrifice one or a few lives to save more. It is a classic moral and ethical problem with no wrong answer, so long as you can work through the thinking process in which you arrived at your answer.\n\nI personally believe that ethical questions are important in choice-based gameplay, as they force the player to evaluate their core beliefs, for better or worse.\n\nExamples of the trolley can be found in games such as Mass Effect, in which you may kill the last Rachni queen and effectively end the species, or allow it to live despite it possibly being a threat to nearly every other species in the galaxy (on the single promise that it will isolate itself). Or in Life is Strange, in which you may choose to save the life of your best friend or save the life of a town full unlikable, but innocent people.\n\nI think that many times these choices are not as difficult as the developers would intend, often because of the nature of games involve some form of reward. In Mass Effect for example, saving the Rachni results in more war assets in Mass Effect 3. By gamifying these ethical questions, the meaning is lost. Other times, when asked to choose between saving one person or many people, players would pick the utilitarian side and believe it to be a “no-brainer,” reducing the meaning of the question to simple math and picking to save the many.\n\nIt seems to me that the trolley problem isn’t getting tired, but it’s commonly being used wrong. Ethical questions aren’t about math, nor should they encourage players to think that making an ethically “good” choice would be the most beneficial for them. Rather, they should be reframed so that it is unclear what is morally “correct” or ethical.\n\nDo you agree or disagree? Is the trolley problem becoming tired in choice-based gameplay? Or is it just not being utilized to its potential?\n",

And while it wasnt that bad for me when i played it i noticed that most of game i had it turned on so i didnt see a lot of  occasions to appreciate art style and graphics(I had recently the same problem with Observer). \n\nBut when i think about it more i thought that it is preety lazy thing to do from developers. Instead of making actual puzzles game is trying to make you feel like u are doing some meaningfull but in reality you just go from one highlighted thing to another while listening some dialogs from main protagonist.\n\nAfter a while it can become tedious when this mechanic is abused like in Witcher 3 where most of quest follow the same pattern: go to place---&gt;look for things with \"detective vision\"---&gt;follow some marks to last place where plot is decided.\n\nThere are for sure more games that used this mechanic in one way or another so feel free to add more examples. What do you think? Is this mechanic is bad or am i just exaggerating? What games in your opinion properly used this mechanic?\n\nSorry for any grammar mistakes, i'm not native speaker.",

However, there's a few things I didn't touch upon that I really wanna talk about somewhere, but it felt out of place in the article. I love how unique the medium of games is through interactivity, and I think the presentation of a player character's death is a perfect way to highlight this contrast.\n\nUnlike when you watch a death in a film, or read about one in a book, when playing a game you go through that proxied version of 'death' from a first person perspective. This never really happens anywhere else except perhaps something like a board game, mostly because you rarely get 2nd person prose or first person films.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on death in games?\n\n(P.S. The article also talks about Metroid: Zero Mission quite a bit. What a great game!)",

I see a lot of complaints however, that the lack of traditional dungeons is a negative aspect of the game. BotW's goal was to shift the status quo. Not just for Nintendo, but for modern gaming.\n\nGiven BotW's design as a \"go anywhere, do anything, at anytime\" style of game, traditional zelda dungeons just don't fit within that philosophy. Dungeons are normally a place of progression within the game. You advance in the story, you get a new weapon, gain more experience, etc. BotW's progression system is more exploration based, instead of stifling progression with multiple dungeons.\n\nAgain, I don't think that dungeons in future iterations are a bad thing, but the Zelda series is now changed forever and because of that we may never see traditional dungeons again. I can understand why that may be disappointing, but it doesn't make BotW, or the franchise, any worse off because of it.",

        "text": "Hi there!\n\nI’m Dr. Nick Bowman … my colleague, Dr. Jaime Banks, and I are professors/researchers at West Virginia University. We’re currently working on a project on gamers’ favorite memories of their avatars, and how they think and feel about their avatars in general. This project is part of our ongoing research on the topic (with more than 4,000 gamers now!), but we’re really excited about this particular project because it is both a research study and a curated public digital collection.\n\nNOTE: You might have heard about this project, as we had a few folks participate back in May 2018. We've got room for more, so we're making a second announcement!\n\nSo what does that mean, exactly? Well, there are two parts to the project.\n\nPart 1 is the research portion, and it’s open to anyone who wants to participate … just check out our online survey, identify your favorite avatar, and then tell us the story of your favorite memory with that avatar. (This can be a WoW avatar, or one from any other game.) Then we’ll ask you to fill out some multiple-choice questions about it and tell us a bit about yourself. You can also, at the end, tell us if you’re interested in participating in Part 2. That takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, and everyone who finishes that survey will be entered into a random drawing for a $100 Amazon e-gift card.\n\nFor Part 2, we’ll sift through all of the stories from Part 1 and select 100 people from those who say they want to participate in the second portion. Those 100 people will be invited to offer extended versions of their story – in written format or audio recording or video recording – to be included as part of a public online collection hosted by the WVU Libraries. (Don’t worry – if you’re selected, you’ll learn more about this and you can tell us if you want to be identified or not.) This survey takes 20-30 minutes to complete (depending on how much information you offer) and everyone who is invited and participates fully in this part will be paid $10 via an Amazon e-gift card. From those 100 stories, 10-12 will be selected for a curated exhibit in the physical WVU library. All information from this second survey could also be used for research purposes. The main idea here, though, is to curate a collection of interesting stories about games and avatars to help the general public get a better understanding of the role they play in peoples’ lives and why and how they matter in contemporary culture. They don’t have to be epic stories or show how l33t you are … they just have to be authentic stories.\n\nThis study has been acknowledged by the WVU research ethics board (protocol #1805112352) and adheres to federal standards for protecting research participant rights and privacy. Please be aware that if you participate in this study, the information you provide will be kept forever in order to facilitate scientific review and (for the second study) to sustain the digital collection.\n\nIf you wish to participate in this study, please use the following link to be automatically redirected to the survey:\n\n[https://wvu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_0N8crESPwa5bVv7](https://wvu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0N8crESPwa5bVv7)\n\nIf you have any questions about study, you're very welcome to send me a message or email me at the address below.\n\nThanks! :)\n\n\\~Nick [nicholas.bowman@mail.wvu.edu](mailto:nicholas.bowman@mail.wvu.edu) // [https://communicationstudies.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/nick-bowman](https://communicationstudies.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-directory/nick-bowman) // u/bowmanspartan\n\n\\~Jaime [jabanks@mail.wvu.edu](mailto:jabanks@mail.wvu.edu) // [http://comm.wvu.edu/fs/faculty/jbanks](http://comm.wvu.edu/fs/faculty/jbanks) // u/amperjay",

Not giving the player agency.\n\nYet, when it comes to something as simple as letting certain people with slower reflexes actually play the game, we shun it and all of a sudden care what the developer thinks. Convenient.\n\nIf we cared about developer intent, we would still have JRPG's with great, wacky stories like the PS1 era. We'd maybe be able to focus on quality more than quantity (assuming the devs are more focused on releasing a good game than a good selling one).\n\nBut we don't care, we've never cared.

        "text": "For the most part, skills in RPGs are determined entirely by stats and class, any of which is equally accessible by either gender. This accomplishes two things from a developer's perspective: 1) it simplifies the process by avoiding having to design around multiple scenarios, and 2) it avoids the potentially controversial depiction of women as being weaker than men. But I think, if handled correctly, it could actually be a really interesting, insightful, and respectful design choice if a dev really went for it in terms of gritty realism.\n\nImagine a game in a Shadowrun type setting (other settings could work as well, but this is the one that comes to mind for me.) You can choose all sorts of features in an open-ended character designer at the beginning, but if you choose a male character, you will be locked into a range of stats that includes significantly higher strength and endurance, while a female character will have significantly higher spirit and charm stats. The scenario and goals will be the same in either case, but a successful approach will require different strategies.\n\nA male character will be much better suited to combat, can go toe-to-toe and take a few hits before going down, but will be attacked on sight by all enemies and has to acquire and spend a lot of money to get items. No one outside of a couple close friends will help him unless he recruits mercenaries or finds an angle to blackmail or threaten someone. If a woman has an item he needs and he beats her up and takes it rather than buying it from her legitimately, his reputation can begin to suffer horribly to the point that random NPCs will attack him everywhere and the police will eventually come after him.\n\nA female character will be quickly outmatched if surrounded by hostile armed men, unless equipped with a very powerful firearm. She will have realistically lower health and melee damage, but people will be more sympathetic in general, and some enemies will be hesitant to attack her, allowing her to set up sucker punch first strikes. There will be many people who offer her free or cheap help in the form of items, ammo, and co-op, but part of the challenge will be ferreting out who has the means and the motive to help and who is trying to show off or take advantage of a woman. \n\nIf done well, with just a focus on an immersive world and good gameplay and no heavy-handed MRA or SJW message, this could really be a subtle way to help everyone experience empathy. Imagine people playing through once as their own gender, thinking \"Yup, that's the way the world works,\" and then doing a second playthrough as the opposite gender and really being made to think what a survival situation would look like. Suddenly a woman, through the eyes of a man, sees a world where no one cares about him, everyone is rude, and money talks. A man, likewise through the eyes of a woman facing a difficult gang combat scenario, accepts an offer of help from some big-talker who ends up barely chasing off one enemy while the player does all of the heavy lifting, only to have the \"ally\" turn and say \"You know you basically owe me your life...\" while leering at her.\n\nIn my opinion, showing is much more powerful than telling. This would be the kind of game that could get real dialogue going, not to mention would avoid the strange, immersion-breaking tendency for RPGs to have women and men have the exact same strength and social stats.  \n\n**TLDR:** A realistic game where men are stronger and more durable and women have an easier time networking for help and tricking enemies would be very interesting to me.",

        "text": "Hello! I felt really gutted from getting 40+ downvotes from stating that I was worried all the characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will be only unlockable through a potential story mode. Is this really how it is? I have spent a decade trying to find a “second life”, and no the game with the same title is clunky outdated garbage. \n\nI remember making a thread praising Forza Horizon 4 for finally letting us progress how we like through many optional professions. Same goes to Elite Dangerous and Fallout 76. But in the same thread, I noticed people were very wary and I could say way too scared to give players options from the beginning. Let me talk about a one gripe that have stopped me from enjoying most “second lives”:\n\n**“The endgame mentality”**\n\nIf you played Destiny, WoW or Monster Hunter World, you would probably notice the endgame is where all 3 games show their true colours. I’ve hardly ever noticed anyone talk about how great the story or levelling is in the games mentioned above. In fact, I’ve seen annoyance. However when I bring up that I don’t like being forced to do the “main quest” to unlock everything that the endgame has to offer, I seem to hear a lot of resistance and spite. “casualising”, “nothing to do” etc. Yet in games like Monster Hunter, the grinding for loot and killing beasts can entertain you for hundreds of hours. it’s not like the game is easy either.\n\nWhy am I so spiteful of main quests and “story gating”?\n\n* what if you are stuck on a ridiculously difficult boss fight, say on the level of Ornstein and Smaug from Dark Souls? You’ll have to keep throwing yourself at the boss until you beat it. And where is the endgame? The objectively best part of whatever game this is? Beat the boss or break your controller/disc in outright anger after the 500th try, There’s actually a main quest that had an absolutely insanely hard boss before the endgame. You’ll understand if you beat Pokémon USUM, but it is a little spoilery for those that never witnessed it. [Spoiler](#s ”Ultra Necrozma”)\n\n* If it’s a huge online community heavy game like Destiny, the story loses its “sense”. You literally have to save the world under urgency... but what about everyone else? Millions already did! the same cutscenes (and god forbid they are unskippable) all the time. What about starting a new character? oh god. The same 40 hour main quest to play the endgame, where the game starts mind you...\n\n* It’s just archaic, ever dreamed of a “second life” that you can immerse yourself in? I feel technical limitations are why Story gating was a thing for so long. No one had time or the money to make a massive world with much immersion. Now that AI, networking and gaming itself is getting bigger and better by the year, I absolutely feel there’s no need anymore. We now have the ability to let players create their own story yet not get bored but no one is CAPATILISING on it. Devs and players are just way too scared of this kind of change.\n\nI’m making this thread to really know... WHO is actually feeling this way as well? Devs and gamers included.\n\nSome points I really want to read from you guys:\n\n* Are you ready for games to change in a way where a 40 hour story is not forced upon you in your new immersive life?\n* Is there good reason for opposition? All I hear is “there needs to be a story to play” but people seem to forget others want “options” to live their new lives how they like. \n\nPeace out guys! And thanks for reading and replying,\n\nTL;DR - I find it ridiculous and unplayable if a game forces you to play through a storyline where the endgame is the prime content. I wanna know who else has a similar outlook and why.\n",

        "text": "VIDEO GAME CRITICISM'S NEED FOR CHANGE\n\nAuthor: David Bakker \n10-Aug-2018\n\nCategory: Opinion\n\nWith IGN firing one of their writers after an investigation regarding their Dead Cells Review confirmed plagiarism, the gaming community once again felt betrayed by professional game critics. With every review, game critics seem to be taken less seriously by their readers. In this opinion piece, I will explain what I consider to be the main flaws of Video Game Criticism as of today, why they are present, and what my solutions for the issues would be. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGame critics, people love to hate them. Not without reason, as many game critics make errors in judgment when attempting to entertain readers as well as outing their opinion simultaneously.\n\nI am not trying to defend game critics at all in this article. On the contrary, I'll be going in depth about the problems many review readers encounter, why they occur, and what a better alternative would be for the many flaws game critics show off in their reviews.\n\nBefore I can get to the flaws of game critics, however, it is important to look at what a game critic's role is and what the differences between present game critics are.\nA game critic is essentially a writer specialized in video gaming and writing reviews (basically a recap of the game combined with a personal opinion and score). The reviews are in essence as simple as can be: the writer experiences a game first-hand and continues to write about its experiences, giving a game a certain score. These scores are in most cases given before the release of a game, meaning game producers can use these to promote their game if positive. There are also websites that combine the scores of major video game magazines (e.g. Metacritic), which makes the general critic consensus on a game known worldwide, increasing or decreasing the hype around an upcoming title.\n\nA complication in this can be found in the way magazines give scores. Metacritic uses a point system, with 100 (a 10.0) being the maximum score, and a 0 (0.0) being the minimum. In this system, even critics that tend to use decimals can get their precise score mixed into the average critic score. However, some critics don't use a something out of 10 or 100 score. There are critics that rate out of 5. Some critics don't even give a numerical score, but instead simply give a type of recommendation.\n\nThe problem with the differences in scoring is that there is no real connection between scores. Is 2.5/5 the same score as a 5/10? Does 'highly recommended' mean a game deserves an 8/10 or higher? This can even confuse a critic since it's hard to tell what number even means 'good' or 'average'. But it's even more complicated than that.\n\nTHE FLAWS OF VIDEO GAME JOURNALISM COMPANIES\n\nThere are different approaches for writers to come up with a score when writing their review. This confuses the reader but isn't necessarily a bad thing. If every company would simply stick to its own, original way of doing things, there would not be a Metacritic. Every reader could just pick a couple reviews sites to put their trust in and witness something unique for every single video game magazine. But the market demands a general consensus; it is the only professional way to distinguish games quality-wise. This should have also been very beneficial to loyal followers of game scores; they are informed directly and can make an objective choice for a game to play.\nBut the problem lies in this collection of reviews. Being the 30th critic that rates a game 80/100 is not as spectacular as rating it 50/100 and getting more traffic on an individual website. Or, if a game is indeed rated 80/100, why not appreciate it even more to appeal to the game's loyal fanbase and give it a 95/100?\nThe incentive to create a controversial review is apparent but has its risks. Will the writer risk getting eviscerated in the comment section, for example?\n\nThis brings me directly to the plagiarized Dead Cells Review by IGN. The score given was a 9.7/10, which means the game is just a little shy of an absolute masterpiece. The writer of the review appears to have copied the entire content for its review from a lesser known YouTube channel. The only reason to take such a risk in my mind would be out of laziness, or because the writer was short on time. Either way, this would prove that giving higher scores takes less effort (since it requires less actual criticism) and since higher scores are appreciated by more fans of a game, such a combination can prove to be the ideal way to produce low-effort, high-appreciation reviews. That being said, there are instances where deconstructing the hype of a game with a lower score than people anticipated can work positively as well, with readers wondering why the game did not perform as expected. This also works the other way around. When games have no high expectations and perform well, readers will also be curious as to why.\nSuch a method of producing reviews could have short-term success, but with the growing complaints against video game critics, maybe a more honest and critical position would be preferable at the moment. It almost feels as if we're at the point where every game critic is anticipating the best game of all time, and can't stop putting out high scores. \n\nAnother issue that directly involves both reviews and scores is the management of writers and editors. There is a clear contrast between an objective and subjective score. Since there is always a single writer for a review, a single score could be very far off the general consensus, meaning it could become a controversial review. It's possible that companies manage review scores to fit with the pre-existing hype surrounding a game. However, this is just pure conjecture as I have no evidence to support this theory. Furthermore, it is hard to tell which writer on a website with multiple writers will review a game. This means that the reader will always be at a disadvantage, not knowing who's point of view a review is coming from. Although game journalism outlets publish the author's name, I consider it hard to trust a certain writer enough because of the lack of spotlight and depth when an outlet has lots of writers writing all kinds of games. \n\nThe allure of Review Copies\n\nAnother issue is the existence of review codes. Now obviously, every critic loves the opportunity to play a game before others get to and without any costs. Major game journalism companies rely on these early review codes. This means, however, that criticizing a game too harshly may lead to a broken bond between game developer and game magazine. If an outlet can't get a review code, the review won't be done until after the initial release of the game, which means that the journalists of the magazine have no opportunity to impact the critic score before the game's release. To avoid this risk in the first place, there might be limitations on how harshly a game can be reviewed. It does help if multiple other critics share the negative opinion on certain games, but in most cases, it's still a matter of better safe than sorry.\n\nHowever, what if journalism outlets took the risk by reviewing a game in an honest way and would lose their privilege to receive review copies by a certain developer? If the outlet would publish an article on it which blew up, the developer could expect even more negative publicity. So I sincerely doubt game developers would actually do this. For now, the only critical people being denied review copies are Youtubers, who are mostly on their own.\n\nTo resolve the issue of cautiously written reviews, I believe it best to universally verify which gaming journalism outlets can get review copies for games. To make this verification neutral and impactful, why not let Metacritic determine the verified outlets for example? This verification should be indefinite, with possibilities to join the list for newer outlets, just like the way Metacritic works as a website. Only in the case of a huge scandal or a consistent rate of poorly reviewed games can an outlet be banned from it. This should give review magazines the confidence to write actual honest reviews with fitting scores for all sorts of games. \n\nWHAT REVIEWS SHOULD BE LIKE\n\nThe Value of a Video Game Review\n\nI don't consider myself in any position to tell others how video game reviews should be written, but I have formed an opinion on the matter by simply thinking about what people should hope to see when they are looking up a review score. I believe that there are several reasons to look for review scores:\n\n1. Looking for a new game to play: what's recommended?\n2. In anticipation of a new game: is it as good as I hope/expect it to be?\n3. In retrospect: wow, I really enjoyed this game; what does it score?\n\nBecause review codes are handed out before the release of the game, with the first reviews being online right before the worldwide release, the essence of a video game review is its recommendation. Sure, it is great to be comparing the results with the expectations and to put the game on a timeline, but primarily, these reviews are scores that tell the reader just exactly how good a game is. But there are different opinions on what can be considered a good video game. \n\nMost review scores consist of comparing the positive aspects to the negative aspects. If a game has more positive than negative aspects, it must be a good game. Now, obviously, there is so much wrong with this.\nThe main issue for a game critic in its reviews is to separate subjective opinions from objective observations. Most critics make their reviews a weak sum of positive and negative experiences with a score at the end that summarizes these positive and negative points in an accurate way. For many writers, this is the go-to method to rate a game. It's easy to summarize since the positives and negatives reflect the score; no aspect needs to bear extra weight. What this means is that a game with no particularly bad aspects could get a 10/10. But what if the game lacks ingenuity? Is a game that is well built and fun to play through for tons of hours an experience worthy of a perfect score? Obviously not. To separate the average from good and beyond, originality and unique characteristics are key to video game magic.\n\nThere are also different opinions on what it is that makes a video game a video game. Is a game with only dialogue choices worthy of being called a video game? Are there standards that every video game should have as a bare minimum? Questions like these should get a critic thinking while approaching a new experience. In my mind, that's what it's all about. A video game should be considered an interactive video experience in which the player can influence the course of events, no matter how minimal. This is what separates a video game from a movie or a board game.\n\nOnce a critic knows the basics of the existence of video games, they have the authority to review something. Therefore, the quality of a review is not determined by the critic's taste or experience, but merely by their ability to be both subjective and objective in a review and being capable of utilizing relevant arguments for its statements.\n\nWhile the ability to strengthen your opinion on a game with solid arguments is the key to any opinion piece, especially reviews, the scoring is what shapes a review the most. This is because:\n\n1. The score is the shortest and most noteworthy summary of a critic's opinion on something.\n2. The score puts the game in perspective; how good is this game compared to that game?\n3. How positive or negative is a critic on this game compared to other critics?\n\nSadly, most reviews serve as a build-up to the score at the end. When I would be looking at a new game's Metacritic score, I would also look at where the scores came from. An interesting looking review might be worth a look, but reading an entire review for every major release is just not something that appeals to a big audience. The score is easy to understand and memorable.\n\nAnd that's why it is important to point out just how inaccurate most video game scores are. Obviously, differences in approach cause perspective problems when comparing reviews. A 'liked-a-lot' is hard to compare to an 80/100, after all. Above all, it is essential that scores given by reviewers fit the reader's value of that score. And that's why the current scores don't make any sense to readers. \n\nThe Price of Enjoyment\n\nBefore a critic could tell what a score stands for, they should carefully take into account what actually should impact a score. The price of a game upon release is something I barely see critics use when determining their game score. Apart from being a cost, the price of a game tells its potential buyers just how big of a game they are making, with $60-$70 being an AAA-title, a game that has been in development for a bunch of years with a big budget. A $15 game, on the other hand, is rarely a major video game from a major company. However, indie projects such as Hollow Knight and Stardew Valley do live up to what could have been a major game title. In that case, a critic should view a game by what it accomplishes and what it set out to be. For example, Stardew Valley is a project by a single person. The game is absolutely loved by many gamers, is full of original gimmicks and has a unique feel to it. If so, the game exceeds its own expectations and deserves a higher score than it would have gotten if the price was not included in the review. On the other hand, there are annual franchises with minor upgrades and reoccuring bugs. Surely, they still have loads of gameplay components, but they simply don't fit the full price tag. \n\nAnother way to use the price in a review is by counting the $ per hour. For example, as of now, I have played 150 hours of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The game cost $70 when I bought it. This means I have paid less than $0,50 for every hour played, which gives it great value. The problem in this though lies in less gameplay-focused games. For example, God of War (also an excellent game), only took me 60 hours to 100% with the same price tag. Most adventure games that rely heavily on dialogue have fewer hours. This makes the method slightly unfavorable since games have different focuses; game time is not everything. God of War offers higher quality for its reduced time than most games with longer runs, for example.\nIf a critic were to review with eyes on the price tag, there would still be a difference between games. An 8/10 game of $15 should be less enjoyable than an 8/10 of $60. Otherwise, the game of $15 would surpass the score of the $60 game. When looking at the greatest games of all time, this is also of importance. Price doesn't have a role in determining the greatest games of all time, so it doesn't impact a game's afterlife. \n\nOriginal Quality over Repeated Quantity\n\nOnce the price tag is taken into consideration, the main objective for a critic should be the rating of the critic's experience. I see reviewers talking about how much fun they had, and while I believe enjoyment is a positive quality for a game to have, not all games have to be fun to be good. If the gaming community considers video gaming to be an art, then it should treat its games like they can or cannot be art. Art involves all kinds of emotions, not sheer joy or realism. So when rating a gaming experience, priority number one should be to look at what a game did to you that other games did not. Take a game like Breath of the Wild, where the minimal sound effects, the beautiful art style, incredibly accurate physics and dynamic environments suck you into the game like never before seen. I felt very alive when playing such a masterful game, it truly was art to me. Then there are games like Hollow Knight, which sucked me into a dark world full of struggles and decay. Once again, I was blown away by the originality a game could have. That is how you separate art from games that simply aim for the fun factor and are thus less ambitious in general. Annual franchises and most free-to-play games rely on fans to come back, so they give them what they already know with slight upgrades. Not to be called an innovation at all, yet still positively received by critics because of their already proven qualities. \n\nThis directly corresponds to the rating a video game gets. A rating should primarily be based on the experience a critic has with the game, and how it stands out compared to other similar titles. Obviously, the game's mechanics and technical properties are to be taken into consideration as well, since even the greatest game cannot be experienced if technical issues hinder it from being played, but this is only to be expected. A malfunctioning game is an unfinished product and can't be called a complete game in the first place. \n\nSubjective Versus Objective Reviews\n\nI hope this explains my main critique regarding ratings. I'll follow up with some examples to support my argument.\nI see most critics mindlessly giving a game an 8+/10 score because it is fun and its mechanics work, while multiple games with similar mechanics, story writing, and technical achievements have been released in the same year. This confuses the mainstream gamer and makes them believe that a game is good because it functions and is up to today's standards. For example, let's take a look at the FIFA franchise. For football fans, FIFA is a great way to kill time with friends and has competitive modes to further develop the player's interest in the game. However, every new FIFA game is a slight upgrade on the last. EA knows that the interest in FIFA remains, so bringing a new low-effort version every year is very profitable and a logical option. If you would look at the review scores for the recent FIFA, you would see no bad overall scores. This, while every single version is completely redundant for players that are not diehard fans of the franchise. This also shows that originality isn't exactly an important quality for a game to have, as FIFA's Metacritic overall scores are similar to those of original indie games, even if they have only few flaws. \n\nA perfect example of critics reviewing the size of a game rather than the unique experience a game brings. In this case, critics review games too objectively, only reviewing the content a game has and not the feeling they get from it. On the other end, there is being too subjective. I have read reviews of video games from popular franchises that are clearly written by fans of the franchise. Normally, this should not be a problem, but if the reasoning for a 9.5/10 is ''it's ideal for fans of the franchise'', then there is a clear lack of objectivity in a review.\n\nA subjective review does not require a lack of objectivity to be controversial. When YouTuber Jim Sterling gave Hellblade a 1/10, he did so because a game-breaking glitch ruined his personal experience. In his mind, his score was justified because he couldn't play the game, but it worked fine for everyone else. This resulted in him getting hated for his overly negative review of the game. When he reviewed Breath of the Wild with a score of 7/10, whereas the general consensus was between 9.5 and 10/10. Once again, he received hateful comments for being honest with himself in his review. A 7/10 is by no means a bad score objectively speaking, yet he still got bashed for his opinion. This just goes to show how vulnerable an honest critic is to the general consensus. \n\nThat being said, I can understand the difficulty in balancing between subjective experience and objective universal content reviewing. First of all, objective opinions are usually shared among reviewers. When a critic encounters a straightforward bug in a game, for example, it's likely that other critics will encounter the same bug and report about it similarly. Second of all, even games with comparable scores might not be remembered as good compared to the other as the scores suggest after a certain time. Some games are just more successful in leaving their mark than others. Third of all, no reviewer is perfect, nor is any review. One of the reasons for me to write such an article is actually me doubting my own scoring. I gave Dragon Quest Builders an 8/10 because when I played it, I thought the game was polished, enjoyable and gave me a sense of a sandbox while still being an RPG. When I look back on it, I can say that I have been struggling to pick the game up, since it just doesn't stand out as much. Still, in the current way of rating games, I didn't make an error in judgment by giving it an 8/10. However, would I recommend a $45 game that does not stand out at all? Of course not. \n\nFair Scoring\n\nWhen rating a game, a critic should also keep game history in mind. When reviewing a game, they should always consider the game a new product. Today's standards are different from those of the seventh console generation, so when a game has great graphics on a PS4 Pro, it shouldn't be considered a huge plus just because it is a AAA game and lives up to today's standards. Only when it pushes the edge of graphical capabilities (like Uncharted 4), it can impact the critic's score drastically.\nA useful tool for reviewing a product partly on its technical prowess can be to put the game in perspective. Is a game as inventive in RPG systems as Final Fantasy was when it first released? Is a game that utilizes cinematic moments as polished as The Last Of Us in 2013? Questions like these can be helpful to determine just how much a game pushes the edge in its respective genre. \n\nWhen major critics review games, the score is hardly lower than a 7.5. Even a franchise as repetitive as Call of Duty will always get away with an 8/10. The funny thing is, when a AAA game receives an 80/100 on Metacritic on average, I will know it's not worth the purchase, whereas an indie game with a 70/100 can be awesome for the lower price. The reason for this is simple: indie games have more exploitable weaknesses since they are made on a smaller budget. Furthermore, rating an indie game harshly is not as risky as rating an annual franchise critically. But for the reader, this can only cause confusion. When a gamer can get 4 original indie game experiences with some apparent flaws for the same price as a single AAA game without any new ambitions, the critic consensus will most likely tell the gamer to go for the AAA game, while every single indie game's experience will be much more worthwhile and memorable.\n\nThere should be a new consensus regarding scores, where 5/10 is 'average' and 7/10 is 'good', as right now a 7 is practically the lowest score a AAA game can get at the moment, while annual franchises receive 8's, games that fail to live up to a certain hype score 7's and only scandalous games like Star Wars: Battlefront II end up with a 6.\nOnly when critics can rate video games based on their value as original art, when they are free to give scores from 0-10; only then the mainstream gamer can be well-informed on new titles and collect only the most essential games to play. It would work out for game journalism outlets just as well since they would finally be taken seriously again. \n\nCurrently, the status quo looks to be far from being resolved. This is mainly because a single critic can not impact its competitors directly to shift to a more critical way of reviewing. The risk is also far too great. Changing in favor of fair reviews might win the hearts of some readers, but might not convince game developers, who won't risk worse scores.\n\nI can advise readers to always criticize reviews when reading. It's also important to actually read a review instead of just the score. Comparing multiple sources (at least 3) is also recommended since the objective criticism can be compared and the subjective criticism can be balanced.\n\nFor a major change, we would have to hope for a stronger incentive to publish honest reviews and a more protected status for more popular game journalism outlets, so that they can review a game without having to hold back. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI have only scratched the surface of the issues people encounter when looking up reviews of games. There are tons of additional flaws worth analyzing, but they might get in the way of the point I am trying to make in this article. \n\nTo sum it up (TL;DR): \n\n1. Critics should be aware of the fact that honest reviews with accurate criticism appeal to more people and make a journalism outlet more authentic on a topic.\n2. Critics should be free of review copy stress, they should be able to be as harsh as they need to be on AAA titles.\n3. Reviews are primarily an indicator of how recommended a game is.\n4. The price tag of a game is a useful tool to compare the ambition and confidence of a game's developer with the execution of its ideas.\n5. Video games are to be rated as if they can be art; that's how gamers can separate mindless fun games from true works of art.\n6 Video games are to be rated both subjectively and objectively. Subjectively, because a video game is an experience experienced by the reviewer. Objectively, because a video game should always be put in perspective when reviewed.\n7. When determining how good a game really is, putting it in its time's perspective is essential.\n8. Since Metacritic uses scores from 0-100, critics should utilize all 101 numbers if necessary.\n9. In the current state of video game reviews, it's recommended to use multiple sources and their contexts when determining how good a game actually is. \n\nArticle from: https://www.keengamer.com/article/20183_video-game-criticisms-need-for-change (including layout and images). \n\n",

        "text": "It is difficult to overstate how much I love the Mass Effect trilogy. I was 14 when the last game came out, and I think up to that point, it was the most anticipated event in my life. I still remember waking up early every morning before school and frantically checking the BSN to see if any news had dropped during the night. Looking back now, I don't know if any gaming experience could ever match that excitement.\n\nBut for all my love, the Mass Effect Trilogy ended up suffering heavily from a common enough practice in the industry: fawning over the player character so that the player can feel powerful. Towards the end of the trilogy, the games are constantly telling you Commander Shepard is the greatest soldier in history. That Commander Shepard is the only being the Reapers fear. That Commander Shepard has the awe and speechless admiration of every person in the universe. His general best-ness is so pervasive, you stop considering whether your character even has limitations. Shepard never has the opportunity to pilot a starfighter in the games, but I get the feeling he's still the most deadly fighter ace in the cosmos. You never get to gamble at any of the casinos you enter, but I bet if you could, you would walk away with the deed to the place with a single Renegade dialogue choice. Honestly, a band wrote an [entire song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiRDJLcYua0) about how you can fight like a Krogan and run like a leopard, but you'll never be better than Commander Shepard. The only thing the game feels comfortable telling you Shepard sucks at is dancing.\n\nOne moment sticks out in my mind in particular. In the third game, your best friend and longtime lancer Garrus Vakarian invites you to his favorite spot on the Citadel. The two of you take a break from the war and just spend a few minutes tossing beer bottles and blowing them out of the sky. It is a great scene with one of the series' best characters, and a welcome rest from the weight of the game's plot. The problem is that when it's your turn to take a shot, you get two options: \"Shoot the bottle\" and \"Miss *on purpose*.\" Garrus Vakarian is a freaking deadly sniper, probably one of the best shots in the entire galaxy. His entire persona and a lot of his character is based around him being The Sniper. But you're Commander Shepard, so even if you are playing a space wizard that hasn't touched a sniper rifle since basic, you can still outshoot him without even trying. His seriousness as a character and credibility as a companion is undermined for some pointless ego stroking. Would it have been so hard to let a companion school us, even for just a moment?\n\nIt's a small thing, but so many games seem completely unwilling to suggest that there might exist anyone out there who is better than you. That you aren't, in fact, the deadliest, handsomest, most implacable hero-man the world has ever seen. I think Mass Effect overdoes it, but by far the worst example I've ever seen is Skyrim. That game stacks praise upon you so quickly and so thickly it was impossible for me to take seriously. I remember starting the game and becoming both the legendary Dovahkiin and Harbinger of the Companions within two hours. *By accident.* Every character in the whole breadth of Skyrim can be seduced with an amulet and a dialogue option, because you, the player, are irresistible. You can be a vampire Dragonborn muskrat who leads the assassin's guild, the bard and wizard colleges, the thieves guild, the Blades, and the werewolves all at the same time. But none of it means anything! None of those titles have any significance or acknowledgement in the game's world. They sound impressive, but are really empty and worthless achievements meant to make the player feel important for completing a thirty minute quest line.\n\nDo game developers think so little of us? That all gamers want is to feel powerful, and we will buy even the shallowest and most transparent wish-fulfillment fantasies if they make them? They might be right, but I wish we could have more mature protagonists and storylines in gaming that didn't feel the need to prop up our ego every five minutes. Games where the hero doesn't always get the girl, and will lose fights if he challenges his betters, and does not end up reshaping the world in his image. Games where you are not special.\n\nThe most famous rebuttal of this kind of grovelling hero fantasy is of course, Spec Ops: The Line, but I never liked that game. It seems to me like they made a mediocre, generic shooter and then hated you for playing it. I want to bring up three other games that I think gave the player a different take on stories without shitting all over them. Spoilers abound.\n\n**Halo: Reach** \n\nIn Reach, you play a total badass: Noble Six, famous lone wolf Spartan III. And you know what it gets you? A lonely death in the final moments before your planet is annihilated from orbit. Sure, you're not someone to fuck with, but there are plenty of people scarier than you in your squad alone, and none of you have shit on the Covenant. You gun down hundreds of enemies like any FPS protagonist, but it isn't enough to save Reach. It's not even close, and the game never lets you think it is. You are only one soldier, super or not, and there's nothing you can do. Over the course of the campaign, your squad gets picked off one by one until you are the last man standing. Your efforts are *not* for nothing: you rescue Cortana and allow the Master Chief to get off world and eventually save the day. But you don't live to see it. Reach's campaign is empowering and makes you feel like a badass, but it also make you feel hope, loss, despair, pain, fear, and bloody defiance. Its credits sequence is to this day one of the most elegant marriages of gameplay and theme I've ever seen.\n\n**Dragon Age: Origins**\n\nThough the stakes are much lower in this game, DAO made me feel something Mass Effect never managed: that I couldn't do it. When the game starts, you are a nobody yanked from the jaws of death by the sudden intervention of a badass Grey Warden. There's a war on, and you are given a minor but important task to play on the sidelines of a battle, as befits someone who's been a Warden for 30 minutes. Next thing you know, everything has gone to shit, the king is dead, his army scattered, the world is going to end, and the only people who are remotely qualified to handle the situation are the other Grey Wardens. Who just died to a man defending the king. Oh, and a traitor is blocking all reinforcements from the outside world and sending assassins to kill you. You are saved by a super creepy and ludicrously untrustworthy swamp witch and all you have is a single companion, whose been a Warden for less than a year, and a stack of ancient treaties promising support in a time of Blight. Your only option is to approach the Lord, Kings and Chieftains of your country like beggars with nothing but scraps of paper signed a thousand years before and \"please.\" I remember standing in that swamp and thinking \"How in the hell are we going to pull this off? This is just too big for us.\" Of course, it's an RPG, so I should have known that we would end up saving the day. But in that moment, I was overwhelmed, and realized that I needed to be brave even though the game wasn't telling me how brave I was.\n\n**Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag**\n\nBlack Flag is fondly remembered for its excellent naval combat and fun pirating gameplay, but I was blown away by its story. I think it managed to accomplish what Spec Ops: the Line tried to do: make the player question their actions. Edward Kenway is the hero, and he is a genuine swashbuckler's swashbuckler. Four pistols, two swords, a ship full of cannons, a lust for treasure, and a devil-may-care attitude. He's also kind of a shithead. He's terminally selfish and unbearably immature, risking his life at sea just so he can blow all his money on rum and wenches at the closest port. He never thinks about how his actions affect the people around him, and though he feels bad when he screws over a friend, it's not enough to make him change. Edward wants to live the same fantasy the players do, and the story lets him, but it also shows the consequences of that lifestyle. The game starts with you and a gang of pirates claiming Nassau port and toasting to an age of freedom on the open seas. As the story progresses, all of your friends either die when the law catches up to them, go legit and sell you out, or outgrow you and leave to fight for a cause. In the end, you are left with no one, having pushed away anyone who cared about you. You have to pick yourself up and try to make things right. It's quite a thoughtful arc buried in a pretty mindless pirate game, and it makes me wonder how many people blew past the story without catching its meaning.\n\nWell, I've said enough. What are your thoughts? Do you think this is a problem? Am I being unfair to those games, hyping mediocre campaigns? Please share your thoughts, whatever they may be.",

        "text": "Something about RDR2's trailer today didn't quite sit right with me, and I think its because I prefer vertical slices over overviews. \n\nWhich got me thinking: vertical slices can show the depth of several mechanics working together, while teasing more to come. The disadvantage is that you only get a small glimpse of the overall product, and thus you may come away with a different interpretation of what the game is like.\n\nSome examples of vertical slices would be:\n\n* [The Last of Us Part II - E3 2018 Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A)\n\n* [MGSV: The Phantom Pain - E3 2014 Gameplay Demo (PEGI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggpBtOnq_AA)\n\n* [God of War - E3 2016 Gameplay Trailer | PS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ_GCPaKywg)\n\nContrast that with broad overviews. You're given a general taste of various mechanics or story elements that are usually independent of each-other or hardly interact in the context of the trailer, and give you a better sense of the product overall. The flip-side being, you may not get a sense of the moment to moment gameplay, or understand how the pieces fit together, so to speak.\n\n* [Red Dead Redemption 2: Official Gameplay Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw_oH5oiUSE)\n\n* [What Do You Actually Do in No Man's Sky?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiXjh4oUak0)\n\n*(Let me know if there are better examples of general overview demos. Please note I only used NMS because it was the only other example I could think of.)*\n\n---\n\nWhich do you  prefer, and why? Perhaps a mixture of both?",

Combat usually feels slow and reading dialogue texts can put the to sleep. Even after playing (or attempting to play) some of the best of the genre like FFVII, Golden Sun, and Persona 3, I'm still pretty luke warm on turn-based RPGs.\n\nDespite all these aversions to the genre, two of my favorite games of all time are turn-based RPGs: Paper Mario and its incredible sequel Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door.\n\nI was thinking about these games recently and trying to piece together why I love them so much, while being apathetic to others in the same genre.\n\nI think one of the biggest aspects are the action commands. This mechanic turns a mostly passive combat system into a far more interactive one. Giving me bonuses for hitting a button at the right time or wiggling to analog stick really helps me get over the impersonal hurdle other RPGs seem to give me.\n\nAnother part of the game I love is its tone, which is present in nearly every aspect of the game. Both Paper Mario games are funny and often times satirical. From the witty writing to the colorful and playful visuals, the game truly is a  treat. Maybe it's just my limited view of RPGs but I have not encountered another with a similar tone.\n\nOf course other small things like the lack of random encounters, or the simplicity of the games mechanics also come into play, but overall these two explanations are really the main reason why I think I love the early paper Mario games, but not titles like FFX. \n\nDo you have any favorite games that go against your genre preferences? Why do you think that is? \n",

        "text": "I can easily say that even after 8 years of playing and even after Mass Effect 3's lackluster ending, Mass Effect 2 is my pick for the worst game of the trilogy, and it really stands out by being sandwiched between two games that do what ME2 tries to do but better. Mass Effect 1 is the better RPG, and Mass Effect 3 has the best combat, leaving Mass Effect 2 to be this rather self contained chapter that doesn't do anything the best. \n\nFor context, I think Mass Effect 1, despite its shortcomings, is an amazing RPG that sets the foundation for a beautiful sci-fi world with rich lore and a great story. It's problems largely came with repetitive side-quests, a unwieldy vehicle, and some clunky combat. But at the end of the day, ME1 still told a gripping, blockbuster level story that featured some very memorable characters.\n\nBut rather than fix what it's predecessor did wrong, Mass Effect 2 decides to simply do away with anything that wasn't well received. Instead of roaming planets, you're now left to tediously scan them in a boring mining minigame (mandatory to perfect run the game btw). The base game has no vehicles, and what DLC missions do allow for a vehicle are linear and restricted, which aptly sums up the games level design as well. Gone is an open and expansive Citadel. Instead, we have four floors stacked right on top of each other. The big levels of Mass Effect 1 are replaced with shooter corridors and bland single path movement. \n\nBizarrely, Mass Effect 2 pulls a Star Wars The Last Jedi with its story and opens by setting everything back to square one. The majority of the characters from the first game are completely sidelined. What new characters there are are for the most part, interesting; however, their interaction amongst each other is very minimal and there ultimately are too many people on your crew. To be fair, the only interaction you'd get between crew members in ME1 was during long elevator rides, which have also been replaced by a generic loading screen with ambient noise. \n\nAnother annoyance regarding ME2 and its story is that there are no revelations or developments gained. We knew the Reapers were coming in ME1. By the end of the ME2, nothing new has been gained. And it's final suicide mission that the game centers itself around is nothing more than a glorified checklist followed by a lame final boss. \n\nThe only area I think Mass Effect 2 really improves in is it combat, but this victory is undermined by how much Mass Effect 3 excels in this area. So there you have it: a middle chapter that aims to be more emotional and character driven without really doing much with its characters, and a sequel that offers no new story development and ditches rather than improves aspects of its predecessor that needed more polish.",

        "text": "The new Doom and Wolfenstein titles are some of my favorite games of the past several years. I think all 3 games are able to combine great aspects of early 90s shooters with some modern enhancements.\n\nOne of these enhancements introduced in both franchises is the concept of an upgrade system. In DOOM, most player and weapons upgrades are obtained by finding collectables and/or gaining experience points, however the last upgrade for any weapon modification requires the player to perform a specific task such as kill two enemies with one shotgun blast or kill an enemy with a headshot with a certain weapon. Wolfenstein applies a similar system to its protagonist, increasing your ammo, stealth speed, or health capacity by killing enemies is certain ways.\n\nWhile I love both of these franchises, I absolutely hate this type of upgrade system. Wolfenstein's upgrades can be so arbitrary and miniscule, I often ignore them. Doom's upgrades on the other hand are so immensely powerful, they are pretty much a necessity on higher levels. What I end up doing is just grinding these challenges on weak, zombie type enenies by performing the needed action, killing myself, and repeating. This absolutely kills the break neck pace of Doom, and feels like an unnecessary chore to make the game more enjoyable in the future.\n\nI can understand the counterpoint for a system like this. The developers can incentivize you to play the game in an interesting and unorthodox way. They can help to demonstrate some of the strengths of a weapon that you didn't realize. Despite these pluses, I would say I'm firmly against this sort of system in these two franchises.\n\nWhat is your opinion of these types of upgrade systems? If you like progression like this, what games implemented something like this the best? If you don't , what is a better alternative? Is the trade XP for skills system the best we have?",

That's the only thing you're actually taking from the company. They're not actually losing anything, other than a potential sale \n\nExcept, there was no potential sale. I simply didn't have money to buy any games. My argument was, because I can't afford it, there is no potential sale that I'm stealing \n\nI'm older, and independant now. I can proudly say I haven't pirated a game in years, as I have an income and can afford them. I have even gone back and bought a lot of the games I once pirated. \n\nThe argument no longer applies to me. I mean, I cant buy every game I want, but I can buy any game, every once in a while. Several years ago, I could maybe afford two games a year, now I can probably afford 2 new games a month (though I like savings, so I dont buy that much).\n\nI know this probably isn't an argument that can stand up in court, but is it a fair moral argument?

        "text": "No Man's Sky Next update has come and gone and while it does fix some issue with the game the fundamental question remains unsolved.\n\n####*How can a Procedural Exploration Game work?*\n\nThe terrain generation has gotten pretty good and can be made even more sophisticated.\n\nEven things like space nebulas, asteroid belts and other weird stuff like that can be made with a bit of effort and be visually impressive.\n\nBut it will still ring kind of hallow, it's just a background, you see it and then you leave.\n\nAnd there are still limitations you cannot have a completely unique background every time, it is variation and combination of elements ultimately.\n\n####So how do you give meaning and function to the procedural generation?\n\nThe biggest reason Minecraft works is that you are anchored to a base and as you explore the unknown around you in a quest for resources and progress you slowly familiarize yourself and shape it to make it into \"your territory\".\n\nThe thing is this kind of exploration isn't the wide spanning kind that explores the whole universe, its much more local. Even if a player explores it is to find a place to build upon creative works, to mark it in their own image.\n\nTo see how exploration can work I think we should start with simpler terms.\n\nExploration boiled down can be broken up into two basic things, the process or journey and the thing you find.\n\nThe process is the thing you do to get to the thing you find. It is usually some sort of challenge like combat, detective work or puzzles, here is also where other gameplay elements apply.\n\nAs you can see in some Walking Sims if the process is \"Walk\" then even if you have authored content to explore it can get boring. This is especially a problem with No Man's Sky grinding for resource model where every bit of exploration is stopped abruptly by another resource gate.\n\nNot the thing you find does not need to be separate from the process, the thing you find can be the next puzzle piece that leads you on.\n\nSo the questions are:\n\n####How can you make the process of exploration, the journey interesting?\n\n####And what exactly are the things you can find?\n\nFor the first question you can your standard type of gameplay, combat, detective work, puzzles, building and preparation, maybe trading. It can be done in a procedural game pretty easily.\n\nFor the second question is where things get tricky. What can you find in a space game that is interesting?\n\n*One obvious thing is resources so how would we make them interesting?*\n\nThey can have a certain amount of rarity and even exclusivity linked to some places, but in a infinite scale gameworld once you find one source you can exploit there is nothing more you need.\n\nOne idea to go around this is to implement varying parameters for resources like you find in Star Wars Galaxies harvesting nodes. Every solar system would have its own seed in which it would mutate the parameters of the resources in that system.\n\nThis is interesting from the perspective of crafting and logistics trying to find the best materials in the local neighborhood in which to craft the best products. Especially if moving materials around from one end of the universe to another is cost prohibitive in terms of supplies and logistics.\n\n*Another things to find is new ships, technologies and devices.* \n\nBut this a pretty easily exhaustible content if it is dependent on what the developer puts out.  \nSome recent games like Terratech, From the Depths and Space Engineers has really let players be creative with building all kinds of vehicles. There are some problems with the design like the prominence of spamming and the overall balance. From the Depths are the most successful in implementing trade-offs and make the design viable. \n\nWith the crafting mentioned before you can get very interesting results.\n\nOne interesting consequence of this is having an encounter with ships that outmatch you and keeping some sectors off limits. You would have to analyze your opponents, adapt or come back when you progress further when you are ready for the challenge. The more you can keep things hidden the more you can have a sense of wonder of what is out there.\n\nBut ultimately all of this is very utilitarian, things that are useful for your progression. If the exploration is  meant for another game like say a 4X Strategy game then that utilitarian view is perfectly serviceable.\n\nBut if you want to go beyond you need something more, you need history, you need humans.\n\n####*\"A true exploration game is user generated.\"*\n\nI mentioned in Minecraft that players makes the territory \"their own\". Every hole they dug, every stone they set is part of the history of that world and it got me thinking.\n\nWhat if players can explore a world where players can find exactly this kind of territories and come to understand the players that built them.\n\nTo me that is the clearest picture of what an exploration game can be. A shared universe where players can stream their creations.\n\nImagine traveling a battlefield with wreckage of a great battle a player's empire waged against another empire in a 4X style game.\n\nImagine exploring Factorio like bases used as industry in powering a player empire.\n\nImagine insane ships players crafted from resources from specific systems. Finding a particular material in a system and knowing there is a manufacturing base on a planet.\n\nThe more the players can have creativity agency and tools in marking the world the more you can give depth to things that can be explored.\n\nThere has been a lot of development in the Survival and Engineering genre so things are looking optimistic.  Games  like Rust has powerful base creation tools and From the Depths have already shown ways in how to make designs viable.\n\nTechnology can be partitioned around so that players do not have full access and have to make do with the cards that were given. Sometimes even needing to scavenge for devices that they do not know how to build.",

While I do sincerely love the inclusion of indie titles to the PS4 Library, I also have some concerns if they’ll be future proofed or if they’d be locked to the console, especially with the majority of them being digital only. I should also note that a lot of the indies that I enjoy have been 2D side scrollers/ RPGs, so it’s safe to say that I understand my preference. \n\nI do love the exclusives that Playstation has to offer, but part of me is wondering if, especially with them being only digital, I should shift my indie gaming experience over to a PC. I’ve never been much of a PC gamer to be honest, and I’ve never really been too bothered if I was missing out on their exclusives (except for Cuphead, of course). However, with the future of consoles looking ambiguous after the most recent interview with Ubisoft, I’m wondering if I should keep investing in the digital library for Playstation, or if I should I hold out for a low-key gaming PC for my indie gaming experience, and more likely future proofing. Heck, I’d even be cool with playing indies on my MacBook Pro if it could handle them. \n\nEven so, I don’t plan on getting rid of my PS4 anytime soon, since it was a gift from a close family friend. I’m just thinking if I should space out my gaming options for the digital medium, or if I don’t need to worry about the PS Library’s future and go all in with the digital purchases. Any input you have on the matter would be most helpful, friends. Thanks. ",

        "text": "I'm currently playing Rise of the Tomb Raider and for the most part I enjoy it. It has decent gunplay and platforming and looks gorgeous, however I take issue with just how many mechanics are crammed into this game. Crafting, a skill tree, weapon upgrades, equipment upgrades, 5 different kinds of arrows the list goes on and on.\n\nTo me, these mechanics overcomplicate the game and detract from the experience. In addition to whatever I'm doing, I have to remember what materials I need for crafting, what bonuses my upgraded equipment gives me, or what additional skills I have purchased. I get that it can feel empowering to tune your character to exactly what you want, but I think there is something to be said about a more streamlined approach. \n\nWhat ends up happening is when taking an extended break from gaming, it becomes incredibly tedious to hope back in where you left off. I took a week and a half vacation and after starting up the disc, I was spending 30 minutes relearning all the changes I made to Lara.\n\nAre there any games that come to mind with a similar problem to this, and why do you think that is?

        "text": "Fortnite is understandably controversial on certain parts of the Internet; however, ignoring its gameplay and fans, there is one aspect of the game (specifically the Battle Royale mode, I can't vouch for Save the World) which Epic has executed incredibly well, and that is the pricing/microtransaction model. For those who are unaware, Fortnite: Battle Royale is a free-to-play game, and all in-game microtransactions and purchases are purely cosmetic. There's a wide range of well-made and cleverly-distributed cosmetic content, that allows Epic to easily profit off of a free game just by selling cosmetics with strong marketing. Let's consider that the main industry trends are either to sell free games but have them be overly microtransaction-reliant for gameplay to the point where they're almost unplayable without, or include loads of microtransactions, both gameplay and cosmetic-related, in paid games, sometimes even full-price ones. When people complain about microtransactions in games, these are the trends that they're usually referring to; and they're both deserving of their bad reputation. However, Fortnite manages to completely avoid both of these trends and use a model which is not only obvious, but also benefits players, and benefits Epic due to the massive amount of profit which is being amassed just from selling cosmetics. I'm not trying to imply that this model is new or was created by Epic, but I think it's interesting that it's seeing so much success in such a popular game; in fact, I believe that this model is one of the main reasons for Fortnite's popularity in the first place, for the obvious reasons of it being free and players with money not being able to gain competitive advantages over children whose parents will not buy them in-game items.\n\nSo then, the question is, why don't more games use this model, or at least keep to the rule of only having cosmetic microtransactions regardless of the game price? Some possible reasoning:\n\n* Fortnite is very popular and trendy at the moment, and as such anything that Epic sells within the game will sell fairly well just by virtue of it being there, even if it gives no gameplay advantage. Since the Fortnite craze hasn't died down just yet, it remains to be seen how well this model will hold up when the player count drops. Obviously, not every game is going to be as popular as Fortnite is right now, so if it doesn't hold up for Fortnite in the future, this may be a barrier to other games implementing it.\n\n* This model only works for games with a heavy multiplayer component where cosmetics are a major part of one's multiplayer player image; otherwise, the vast majority of people would be uninterested in buying cosmetics. This is one of the main reasons why most mobile games don't use this model.\n\n* If a game's playercount drops, ingame \"social status\" might become less important as the game itself gets less popular, decreasing the incentive to buy cosmetics.\n\n* If a game isn't being limited to only offering cosmetic microtransaction items, it has the opportunity to offer \"premium content\" items which enhance gameplay but are not generally required for gameplay; these are a common incentive for keeping up the popularity of older games.\n\nFor all of these reasons (and probably more that I missed), do you think this model could hold up if it were used by more games?",

        "text": "The long button press. I have mixed feelings about this modern development in gaming controls. When done well it can fit multiple actions to a crowded controller button, but when implemented poorly, it makes a game feel sluggish and unresponsive. \n\nFirst the good. A long button press can you feel like you're doing something during a  loot animation. It also allows an action to be interrupted, which can make looting a chest when there are enemies around to be a risky decision. It can also add another action to a button that's already used for something else. Perhaps a quick press does an attack, but a long press does a heavier attack. This is mostly seen on the analog triggers, but can work well on any button. This can give a rhythmic flow to combat. \n\nNow the bad. It's mostly used as an contextual interact button. Meaning that every time I want to talk to an NPC, loot something, use a switch, etc. it takes an extra half second or so. Now the game feels sluggish. When I press a button, I expect it to do something. If there's no threat or risk to my character standing still for that fraction of a second during the press, it feels pointless. \n\nMost games do them wrong. A lot of times they are included because they are aping a design choice from another game without understanding it. It's become kind of a modern game design practice that is only there to feel modern and in most cases is simply a waste of time for the player.\n\nHow do you feel about the modern button press?",

        "text": "I think there's a problem when I comes to not only creativity but content and the conversations video games have and create. I know that's weird to say but I feel too many games are just popcorn entertainment centered on the same tropes, themes, and character archetypes in an extremely interchangeable and safe setting. While I understand that part of this is the need to gamily and create \"fun\" in the product. Though I feel games like Metal Gear Solid 2, and Nier:A not only do a good job of getting a deeper point across while still managing to be fun and entertaining. Yet outside of indie's like Paper Please, Hotline Miami, Setsuna and VA-11 HALL-A; we don't see mature themes and conversations outside of the surface level commentary of something like Bioshock, The Last of Us or Spec Ops. Which only have surface levels of subversion and don't door say much outside of saying \"violence is bad\"\n\nCompare that to something like '97's Berserk which not only manages to paint all it's characters in a grey area but dives into some dark themes of villiany, imperialism, greed and the effects of war. Yet we don't get that kind of commentary in games, and if it is there it feels like a 12 year old beating me over the head with a bat there's no subtlety. There's also a lack of subversion in games, the only games that's fully subverted my expectations is something like PT or Nier:A and when I mean subversion I mean something like turning the corners in PT over and over only realizing you've been walking in circles yet everything is changing around you. There's no [Editing Space &amp; Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz49vQwSoTE) in video games. Something that directors like Lynch and Kubrick used well. Which is a shame because video games are perfect for this kind of misdirection.\n\nOn top of all of this there's just a lack in diversity in the stories told and while I understand it's hard to gamify a story the The Florida Project or Paranoia Agent but there's still no attempt to create stories like this. It's just frustrating becuase I'm tired of people praising these fucking anti-hero games that the gameplay is just pressing circle and square to perry, with the same rough and tough hero who \"did a little bad in the past\" fuck. I'm not 12 anymore and I'm tired of the mentality of video games being stuck here. Even then I feel like going back into the PS1&amp;2 era we had more creativity in games like Fatal Frame or No One Lives for Ever and while these games aren't mature per-say, they are at least unique and creative. I hate this idea in gaming that making something mature isn't just adding, blood tits, and some swearing it's bring genuine mature themes to the table.\n\nYes I understand that even the pieces of media I like are more niche than say The Avengers but fuck, at least I get that option. So many games treat me like I'm stupid and I hate this idea of \"just go play indies\" becuase I don't wanna play a 2D Castlevania style game  just becuase \"the story is deep\"and I get it's easier to make movies than games but I don't think it would be that hard to make a AA risk taking smaller game. As much as I do enjoy the games, I'm bored of just popcorn entertainment especially when their settings are getting so stale again I feel like there's a lack of creativity there's not even a Katamari, Viewtiful Joe or Portal to balance out all these \"mature\" games theses days. Maybe this has to do with the core of gamers being these nerdy guys who just want these popcorn action adventure games, people who look at something like Days Gone and want to buy it instead of rolling their eyes like me. I get video games have more hands in the pot than movies but even then we're not even getting things that feel like the early work of Team Silent these days.\n\nI don't know, I figured I'd just share my frustration.",

        "text": "Imagine, you enter a bookstore, but all books there have only titles. A shop assistant explains that their shop has Intellectual Property of HarperCollins, Penguin Intellectual Property, Intellectual Property of Random House, as well as \"Other\" Intellectual Property.\n\nWhen you say that you can hardly make a choice with so vague descriptions, he offers you to choose a genre. So if you want a thriller, you're free to choose between *Macbeth* IP, *Da Vinci Code* IP, *Catcher in the Rye* IP, and  *Die Hard* IP. \n\nYou ask for the same stuff like *Crime and Punishment*. The guy is happy that he has finally understood what you want, and he gives you brand new *Crime and Punishment 3: Revenge*. This franchise became the most popular intellectual property this week. It has Helvetica font. Also it has a whole chapter written on behalf of the old lady as well as updated weapons.\n\n\"Wait, is it made by the same person who wrote *Crime and Punishment 1*? The shop assistant hesitates. It's a very strange question, because 95% of customers are completely happy about *Crime and Punishment 3*. But he suggest you to read the list of subcontracting suppliers. Every Intellectual Property has a list of 20-100 contributors with their job positions. So you can check all the intellectual properties in the shop to look for overlaps.\n\nSpeaking seriously, I started playing videogames just recently, and before that I was completely unaware that video games can be so much different from what I could see people playing (FarmVille, Quake...)\n\nBut what surprised me even more is that games do not have a consistent system of credits similar to movies or books. And I can't figure out why.\n\nI am aware about all those auteur debates or claims that video games are so special that anyone's contribution matters, so that would be unfair to assign praise to only one person. All that is true in some sense. But in the end, there's only one person in charge, especially in such giant projects like modern AAA-games. This single person - not a company - makes a difference between *Fallout 4* and *Fallout New Vegas*, *Far Cry 2* and *Far Cry 3*.\n\nWhen I try to look for this single person, I am stuck. If you looks for credtis even within a single developer company, working on a single \"Intellectual Property\", that will have little sense. Compare credits of *Witcher 1* and *Witcher 3*: Game Vision, Project Lead, Head of Art, Chief Designer, Studio Head, Game Director, Executive Producer, Lead Producer... Which one of these people is responsible for a game as a whole?\n\nNow I have no choice but to read tons of forums or watch hours and hours of letsplays to figure out if I can play such-and-such game, and that ruins so much excitement. Because online game credit databases (i.e. IMDB) today look useless. So I wish we all refer to our games by names of those who created them. But the problem is, today there is no way to know who these people are.\n\n**UPDATE 2 weeks later**\n\nI've been thinking about this phenomenon of absence of authorship in games, and so started noting very strange peculiarities not only in game development, but also game industry in general.\n\n1. It turned out that many famous games **do not credit developers at all**. Portals, Bioshocks 2 for example just put a list of names with no job title. That's insane, and reminds Serf Theatre production in the XIX century.\n\n2. I can't imagine someoe to talk seriously that Adidas/McDonalds/Warner Brothers \"create values\" or \"hold identity\" or \"have personality of their own\". Everyone is aware that these are brands which are owned by legal entities in order to maximize their profit. But when it comes to games, mainstream audience share a belief that **brands = values**.\n\n3. Gamers are conditioned into thinking that **creative work is not about money** and should not be about money. They are much more favourable towards an idea of unpaid labour and sweatshop settings than workforce population in general. \n\nTaking these points in consideration, I can see why the idea of authorship might be a bit revolutionary.",
