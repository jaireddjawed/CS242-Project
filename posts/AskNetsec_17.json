Between HTTPS, HSTS, and Certificate Pinning, I cannot see a solid opportunity in which a rogue access point like a Wi-Fi Pineapple would be able to steal cleartext creds for any large website like Facebook, or banks like Bank of America and other large institutions.\n\nMy overall question here is... is the attack method simply outdated? I have researched heavily into SSLStrip, SSLStrip+, and SSLSplit and it seems to be that no method is reliable at bypassing HSTS in order to get cleartext credentials.\n\nAlso, my understanding of it is that HSTS will hold on the client computer for a long time such as 1 year with that website, so really the only way would be to get extremely lucky that the client computer would be connecting to that website for the first time in a very long time. Other than that, the initial connection will always be directly though HTTPS which means that SSLStrip+ and SSLSplit are completely useless in that scenario.\n\nIs there anything that a Wi-Fi pineapple and devices like it are still good for in the year 2018? Do professional pen testers ever use them?\n\nThanks in advance for any replies.",

When I enter time machine I can see a list of all the backups that have been done on my Mac, but I can't access anything prior to the erasure (which makes sense). Even though the app is visible on the external hard drive, dragging it onto my Mac doesn't bring the old content back. I've contacted their customer support but still waiting to hear back.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion?",

One plus is that the money is good. They tell me I will be offered conversion to permanent anytime. I don't like the culture or the work environment - cube farm + asshole boss!\n\nI get interviews with good companies for engineering, IR and Analyst positions, but because I have been hands off the keyboard for so long tend to flunk the technical interviews. I am told my resume on paper is strong based on previous experience in home country and my education / certs.\n\nI'm here seeking some help on where to go next. Do I stay in my current role and just learn certs before jumping to a real job? Should I just be patient and sit tight -- could it be that I am just being an entitled brat? Should I jump to a lower paid job where I can actually DO security rather than talk about it?\n\nI've thought about doing my CISSP in current role as it's cheap but I really don't feel i'd get much from learning that material over say OSCP or a Cloud cert, just feels that everyone tells me to get it. If I had the money, i'd do one of the SANS certificate programs. I am also hungry for general knowledge as well as being ambitious - I do think a lot about a second Masters (this time actually DFIR specific) or a PhD/Doctorate while I work, since the work is easy and money is good.\n\n**To summarize**: I feel I am trapped in a job which pays enough to keep me around but which is an awful corporate environment and is a place where I don't get to actually put my training into use or learn new things. I am unsure if I should switch jobs, if this is just normal and I need to suck it up and which certifications or education to pursue. I am also considering a second Masters which is strictly DFIR biased or even a PhD/Doctorate.\n\nNOTE: I do have a lab and all that stuff at home which I try to keep my tech skills fresh, but nothing beats doing it at work in my experience.",

        "text": "EDIT 3:I found the problem; the scripts that Nessus uses to do the audit aren't case sensitive when scanning the processes (acrobat.exe vs Acrobat.exe). This caused all of the checks to fail. I modified the scripts to have the correct case, and most of the checks became a pass.\n\nIn group policy, this is defined under computer configuration &gt; administrative template &gt;windows components &gt;Windows defender exploit guard &gt; exploit protection &gt; use a common set of exploit protection settings.  \n  \nI got the XML file from the Windows 10 STIG package. I put the XML in public documents and referenced its location in the group policy setting. I was reading this article;\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml\n\nand used the powershell command Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath filename.xml command to import the XML file that I got from the STIG package, but I'm still getting a ton of findings in the Nessus scans, related to this. For example;  \n  \nExploit Protection mitigations in Windows 10 must be configured for Acrobat.exe. (DEP - Enabled)  \nPolicy Value \n'on'  \n  \nOutput  \n'No entries found'  \n  \nIt looks like the policy isn't configured, or hasn't been deployed. I'm missing a step somewhere in here, but I'm not sure what it is. EDIT just for clarity - \"Policy value 'on'\" is what Nessus is looking for, \"Output 'no entries found'\" is what was actually returned during the scan.  \n  \nEDIT 2: It looks like the policy is being applied, but for some reason Nessus isn't able to see it. In the Windows Defender GUI the application settings match what Nessus wants to see, and the same settings are shown in Powershell when I run the Get-ProcessMitigation cmdlet.",

In my scenario I've got my own home lab and attempted 2 basic vuln hub isos (one being the Basic Pentesting 1 iso) but even that proved difficult purely down to lack of experience and memory of ALL available methods of solving issues. (e.g. I had fergotten about adding URLs into the Host Name to make a page display properly AND I knew nothing about Wordpress Plugin Exploits to make a shell) both seem obvious after the fact... but ultimately I had to watch a youtube video to solve it! ;( \n\nBased on my own personal learningstyle I don't think \"Try Harder\" would of been enough at this early stage, I'm wondering if there is a more \"hand-held\" transitioning method to expand by basic knowledge while practically performing said tutorials alongside.\n\nIn otherwords do sites like Pentester Labs offer this? Is it guided or just \"Here's an ISO, go nuts\"? Are the Virtual Labs on Cybrary helpful in this regards? What interactive methods offer this initial transition (e.g not Hack The Box or OSCP/PWK).\n\nI appreciate that isn't the long term mentallity of a pen tester, but more about connecting the theory to the practical dots until confident enough to \"Try Harder without handholding\".\n\nThanks",

(ie. Look at \"1\", the value is \"2\". Look at address \"2\", and return value \"3\"). This is a forbidden operation as the process does not have the permissions necessary to read address \"1\".\n* Due to speculative execution, the value of \"2\" is read and cached before the CPU checks whether the process is allowed to read address \"1\". The original process fails with an error.\n* A new process attempts to read addresses \"2\" and \"3\". Because address \"2\" was cached, and \"3\" was not, it is faster to read \"2\".\n* Because it was faster to access \"2\", the attacker now knows address \"1\" has value \"2\"\n\nDoes that sound right?

If someone could maybe spit out some wisdom, or direct me to sources that would help, it would be greatly appreciated. I do know DNS zone transfers are done through port 53, but don't think you can do them using a GET request?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "So I was dumb enough to use norton premium security for my home network (15 devices) and even when thinking of alternatives, I always realized how painful and time-consuming it would be to reconfigure everything instead of paying my yearly ransom to symantec and forgetting about it. But that changed this week.\n\nAs always, I bought my licence and proceeded to activate it on my desktop, but every time I tried to login into my norton account, it gave me some BS error. The only wisdom that symantec forums provide was to restart my pc. Great. But after four hours of bios flashing, reinstalling os and trying multiple computers, networks, vpns and whatnot, I just couldn't do it. \n\nAs I was browsing for some solution or alternative online, I stumbled upon a twitter debate [\\[1\\]](https://twitter.com/justinschuh/status/802491391121260544?lang=en) between an antivirus evangelist and evan schuh, the lead chrome security engineer, who was talking about how AV's are often an obstruction for browser safety and that unlike chrome, which is heavily sandboxed, the data handling was very poorly managed by AV's to the point of sometimes breaking https [\\[2\\]](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-and-mozilla-are-right-av-firms-do-need-to-stop-breaking-https-security/). \n\nBut only after reading this blog post [\\[3\\]](https://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/01/disable-your-antivirus-software-except.html) by an ex-firefox dev did I finally question myself: why on earth am I paying $50 a year for a product that slows my devices noticeably, often creates conflicts and problems on my systems, and on top of that *actually makes me vulnerable by increasing my attack surface?* \n\nAfter reading the mentioned blog post, I was quite surprised seeing windows defender being associated with *security*. I have always thought of it as simply another microsoft bloatware that you replace on every clean install of windows. But as it turns out, windows defender is apparently very competitive [\\[4\\]](https://www.av-comparatives.org/comparison/) with other AV's nowadays. And with its integration into windows 10, its minimal system overhead and cloud-based sample analysis, I decided to give it a try. I couldn't activate my \"premium\" antivirus anyways.\n\nAnd after using it for a week, I am seriously impressed. The performance impact is basically non-existant compared to norton, and coupled with malwarebytes anti-malware (works along with an AV, it is not a replacement), I do not feel like I have sacrifised any security. Along with a few chrome extensions, namely ublock origin with custom filters, malwarebytes beta extension and norton safe web (not to be confused with norton safe search, this extension is actually accessible only with an url [\\[5\\]](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/norton-safe-web/kcbdjefcinmmemglijkfgkoiokiiokim) and is unlisted on the chrome web store), I think I have actually upped my security overall, either when browsing or downloading files.\n\n**Tl;dr I have quit my \"premium\" (haha, norton, I know ;-;) antivirus out of desperation and have found out there are actually not only viable, but also** ***better*** **alternatives to using slow, expensive and often unreliable and buggy antivirus.**\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or improvements to my current setup (WD+MBAM and chrome extensions).",

Unless you guys recommend otherwise.\n\nI'm an IT Manager currently, at a Long Term Care Facility. It was kind of a right place right time scenario. Ordinarily my level of experience and certifications might warrant Junior system/network Admin, or Help Desk supervisor. In fact I was the Junior System admin, but my boss quit. I just picked everything up and ran with it. Started making decisions, orders, and implementing new systems as we needed them. So they promoted me. I'm not unhappy with my company at all, the job it's self is just not quite what I want to do. Maybe nothing ever will be, and I just need to be happy I have a decent paying job where I'm not stressed out of my mind.\n\nI have the Big 3 Comptia certs, A+ Net+ Sec+. Less than 3 years exp.\n\nI manage our VOIP, MS 2012 servers and all the functions that come with that (AD, DHCP, WSUS, DNS etc), all our network gear, physical network infrastructure installs. Windows 10 problems, Ipad problems. NAS. Our AV and IDS/IPS. Security policy and frameworks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO27001)\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nI'm really wanting to get more into security, but I'd like to be more on the engineering side. Maybe Pen Testing, although that's not quite engineering (or is it?). I currently do much of our security policy and compliance management (with the help of KBM compliance manager). I don't mind that aspect.\n\nI just really enjoyed coding, although I only did a little. I did most of free code camps stuff. Codecademy's python course, some of codeschool's courses...and I actually enjoyed it. It's been almost 2 years since I've touched any kind of coding, so I'd need to relearn everything.\n\nSo my question is...What do?\n\nComp Sci + Security certs? OSCP? CEH? Good certification courses you guys can recommend? Does the School Matter that much? Is WGU's Comp Sci program ok? I could go to the university of Memphis, but I can't really afford tuition, even with my companies reimbursement.\n\nIs there a better route? I don't have a degree yet, 28 years old. I feel like there is money if I stay in management, but I also like \"Doing\".\n\n\nDo you guys have any recommended security bootcamps/online courses you recommend for learning outside of formal education? Pentestacademy? Any of the SANS or InfoSec institute stuff worth while?\n\nI know these questions are asked pretty regularly, I just feel lost. Maybe I need re-affirmation.",
