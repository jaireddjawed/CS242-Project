I see wash on cold temperature a lot. What do you consider cold? My washing machine has 30, 40 and 60 decrees Celsius.  Is 40 cold enough? I use this one mostly or do you go lower? \n\n2. About different programs, would it make more sence to use \"delicate/hand wash\" for all clothes or to keep using it only for knitted/delicate clothes. What about \"quick\" cycles, do they wear out clothes less?\n\n3. And lastly what about detergent? I use a different one for knitted clothes and it work very well, lasts long due to having such clothes only during the winter. However, in all other cases I use one for colorful clothes. Would it make sence to use a different one for dark/black clothes. I have quite a lot of them.",

        "text": "As long as visibility is not important you can use bubble wrap as window insulation and because of the bubbles it's better and sturdier than those single film widow kits. It's also reusable from year to year. \nBuy or repurpose pieces that are bigger than the panes you want to cover. Rolls can be bought in 12\"-24\" wide rolls of various lengths. \n\nStart with clean inner windows. Cut your pieces the same size as your window panes. To apply, you just need a misting spray bottle (I save empty window cleaner bottles for just such repurposing) to thouroughly spray the bubbled side of the wrap. Alternatively you can simply wipe the windows with a damp cloth then run the bubble side under the tap ensuring to wet all including the edges. Tilt and shake over sink to remove excess water.  Align the top edge with the pane you are covering. Press gently but evenly to the pane. Repeat for each window you wish to cover.\n\nFor reusability you'd want to remove them once warmer weather arrives. If you leave them up the summer sun will degrade the plastic. Since no tape is used it's just a matter of grabbing a corner and gently pulling.  Store them somewhere undisturbed until next winter.\n\nOf course, if your windows do not seal tightly or there are minute gaps around the sills, you'll have to address that separately.",

        "text": "Next week, it'll be 6 months without my own car - now a 1 car household. To be honest, the catalyst was being able to sell my hybrid and get 50% more than I bought it for a year prior. We're the only 1 car household in our cul-de-sac. In fact, one gross offender has literally 6 luxury cars overflowing into the street. Aside from pro-active scheduling, it hasn't really been that difficult. I work 100% remote since Covid. I've only had to Uber it once and a grandma has been able to pick up the other situations. Our state has really expensive vehicle property taxes and we've saved that plus, maintenance, insurance, etc., all which are increasing tremendously. I do miss being electric which our PHEV did 80% of the time. Wanted to see if others (who are remote) have gone nuclear to get rid of a car.",

        "text": "\nSometimes I find myself running errands and too far from home to warrant going back for lunch, forgot to pack anything, and want to avoid buying an expensive meal out. My frugal move is to go to a grocery store and get a couple of healthy things to hold me over that I can either eat then and there or save any leftovers in the car for later, that way I get more than one meal out of it. I always get store brand items that I would buy for my weekly groceries anyway. Some combos only set me back $2-$4. \nAlso works for road trips!\n\n\n- 1/4 lb of anything from the deli case(lunch meat, chicken salad….eat alone or pick up bread item for a sandwich)\n\n- Bread item: single fresh roll from bakery case/ bag of pitas/small loaf of bread if I need some for the week anyway..personal preference for something whole grain \n\n- Container of hummus (could spread on bread item) or get baby carrots. Can bring home both. \n\n- *A single serve Greek yogurt + 1 banana sliced and added to it* (this is my favorite, super filling)\n\n- Jar of peanut butter + 1 banana, spread PB on banana (could also spread PB on bread item). Can bring home PB. \n\nAnd don’t forget to grab some silverware/a plate, usually by the prepared foods section!\n\nSecond tip is when you feel like treating yourself to a meal out, consider going to the grocery store and getting nicer ingredients to make your own (ex. instead of paying $14 for a Panera sandwich, go to the grocery store and get yourself a loaf of fresh bread + a few special deli things.) That way you’re treating yourself to something nicer, it’s probably healthier/less processed, and even if you do spend $14 you get several meals out of the ingredients instead of just one!",

        "text": "I almost never buy secondhand.  But about 20 years ago, I saw a Craigslist post for a farm table.  Solid wood, gorgeous, $20, needs to be refinished.  We scooped it up.  First and only time I ever bought anything private sale, and let’s just say, the experience was interesting.  We couldn’t understand why someone was letting this table go for $20, but when we got there, it became clear.  We joked for a lot of years afterwards about meth mommy, but we’re terrible people and the situation was pretty ugly actually.  \n\nAfter loading up the table that day, she began trying to sell us everything in her house.  Toaster oven?  $3!  Want a hairbrush?  $1!  We can let this ottoman go, actually the whole couch can go too… $50!  As she buzzed around manically, it was clear she was on something.  Her kids were in school, husband at work, and she was selling anything not nailed down.  \n\nAnd it got really tragic when she started offering us her kids’ toys.  We bolted out of there at that point, no longer worried about appearing impolite.  \n\nWell something about that experience, tainted the table.  It ended up in my craft room, and was a super sturdy and reliable and useful, for years.  But it deserved to be refinished, and proudly showcased in a dining room.  It was gorgeous!  But for me, it held sad memories,from the moment we picked it up.  I did get a fantastic craft table for $1 per year, though.  But it never got refinished.  \n\nI started looking around earlier this year, for the best way to get rid of it finally.  Way too nice and solid to trash.  Not refinished though, so not the best to donate.  And I don’t want money for it, I just want it gone.  I hate looking at it.  \n\nAs I mentioned my table woes at work, it turns out, my colleague is a carpenter, and runs a non-profit school that teaches homeless people!  He’d like to have the table to work on with his students, and then sell for profit for the school.  Omg, can you take this table?!?  I’ll deliver it!  Whatever it takes!  So he actually tells me he can pick it up, and he lives nearby too!  Match made in heaven.  The table leaves, I feel 20 years of sadness leave my home finally, it’s over and I feel great about where it’s going.  And then.  \n\nA few days later, in an effort to secure a new job, I stop by an old job to network a little and see if they have anything available.  They used to have this huge, gorgeous, well maintained antique farm table in their conference room, and it probably spurred my love of these tables in the first place.  I have lots of fond, happy memories having our weekly meeting around that table, or using it as a temporary desk if I had to spread out.  I giggled thinking about how I just got rid of a gorgeous farm table, that I never appreciated.  \n\nI walk in and sitting there right in the way of everything in the reception area: their farm table!!!  It’s sitting there all alone, and I start freaking out.  I don’t even give the receptionist my name, I just blurt out, “where is this going?  What’s happening to this table?”  The owners husband comes out at that time, a total peach of a human, and says “oh hey acceptable, great to see you, we don’t know where it’s going, you want it?”  I glance into the conference room, and it’s completely redecorated.  Nice new modern glass and oak conference table.  \n\nDid I really just walk into this?  Do I really have a giant space available in my home, where a farm table just stood?  Did I trade a sad memory table, for a happy memory one?  \n\nI did!!  20 years later, I spent $20 for another antique farm table.  It cost me $19.99 for the uhaul van (actually $38.78 total after taxes and fees, but don’t ruin my narrative ok?), and this thing is GORGEOUS.  It just needs to be refinished…",

This is my first official time moving without my parents help and Im realizing that it's really hard, expensive and time consuming.\n\nI have accumulated a lot of things in one semester (4 months) that I really don't need but have already paid a good amount for them. In total I have spent roughly +$1,000 on things (tables, bed, pots, dishes, clothes, random things, etc) it just seems like a waste throwing everything away and I would try to sell it but I don't have time right now because I'm moving at the end of the week and my semester just ended. That being said it would be impossible for me to take everything with me because I'll be flying to my new job. I'm taking a small luggage and a personal item. So I'm basically only taking my clothes and computer.\n\nMy question is how can I do things differently when I arrive at my new house for the semester? \n\nI want to be able to enjoy my home without feeling like I need to re buy everything and then at the end of the semester have to throw or give everything away?\n\nSome things I have done:\n- have away my bed frame, I'm sleeping on a cheap floor mattress \n- reduced kitchen supplies to the the bare minimum\n- donated most of my clothes I just have the essentials for formal attires and regular clothes \n\nEven then it feels wasteful to throw away what I currently have left and I don't have the money to rebuy the \"essentials\" (bed, pots, pans, tables, etc) when I arrive at my new place?\n\nAny and all help would be greatly appreciated, sorry if this doesn't make any sense! I'm just overwhelmed by how much money I wasted getting things I thought I would need that I enjoyed using but won't be able to take with me :(",

Your friends aren’t going to boast or remember about the amazing Airbnb you got back in April. This built a lot of resentment towards others but mostly towards myself, and I finally decided to be extra frugal these past few months. \n\nI’m on track to have zero debt by the end of this year, but I’ll only have $5k in savings.\n\nI sat down to crunch some numbers and I can save a max of $56k (82%) of my take-home pay if I were to have a tight budget for 2023.\n\nI want nothing more than being able to buy a nice home by the end of next year with a strong safety net if things were to go south in my industry, so any discussion about your experience saving rigorously for 1+ year/s or advice would be much appreciated!",
