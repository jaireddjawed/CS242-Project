        "text": "So I just finished an online semester of Algebra, which required us to take tests through ProctorU.\n\nWhen connecting to ProctorU, we have to consent to allowing them control. Then they scan my computer for virtual machines, etc. Then the assistant controls my mouse to look around for open windows, etc. After the test is done and I close my browser, my camera light goes off.\n\nThis all seems fine. But in the past few startups I've noticed a CMD Prompt window pop up and scroll some text real fast on the desktop before I can read it. My mouse is also double clicking sometimes when I single click.\n\nSince my semester is done, I want to be sure everything is as secure as I can. I ran MalWareBytes with rootkit checker enabled, and found no problems. I looked in the task manager, and nothing stood out (but there's a lot of stuff in services). I Googled how to remove ProctorU's \"LogMeIn\" stuff, and didn't see anything on my computer that matched it.\n\nIs there some tool I can use besides a malware checker? Like a remote access vulnerability checker? I'd really like a program to audit my computer for openings if possible.",

(My SSID is \"Bill Wi the Science Fi\")\n\n[https://imgur.com/sEIMMyr](https://imgur.com/sEIMMyr)\n\nStrange! Especially because after refreshing the page it would sometimes show my SSID. I just use the default IP ranges from the Comcast modem at home, so both my modem and my neighbors modem are configured as [10.0.0.1](https://10.0.0.1).\n\nI was able to stay logged into my modem long enough to re-address it to [10.10.10.1](https://10.10.10.1) and do some digging.\n\nI noticed an unknown device come up in my connected devices list. It was listed as a MoCA device, and I don't have any MoCA devices in my house! I also noticed that my neighbors modem was showing a MoCA connected device as well, so on a hunch I tracked down my MoCA MAC.\n\n[https://imgur.com/nQZao4Z](https://imgur.com/nQZao4Z)\n\nWhy on earth would my modem be connecting to my neighbors modem? Is MoCA really that unsecured?\n\nI tried disabling MoCA, but the modem kept re-enabling it after 30 seconds. So I added the neighbors modems MAC to my blacklist and rebooted. Still connected. \n\n[https://imgur.com/2QGfost](https://imgur.com/2QGfost)\n\n[https://imgur.com/0EuyaCa](https://imgur.com/0EuyaCa)\n\nI eventually had to call Comcast and have them disable MoCA remotely. After reading up a bit, I will keep my appointment with them tomorrow and request a Point of Entry Filter... However, this was something new to me, and quite fun to learn about.. I hope it helps someone!",

        "text": "I asked this question in cscareerquestions and got a negative response but I thought this may be a more appropriate forum:\n\nI have no post secondary education and pursuing a bachelors degree isn't really an option for me at this point in time. I do have several years of experience working as a web developer, a job I very much lucked into and is strongly WordPress-oriented, and have picked up a lot of programming knowledge on my own over the years. \n\nI am in my late 20's and was strongly considering taking a 3 year Advanced Diploma \"Computer Programmer Analyst\" details [here](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/cpa2-computer-programmer-analyst/next). I know this sub tends to advise people away from getting diplomas and toward degrees, but this particular program has a very good reputation and many of its former students had success locating good jobs right out of school.\n\nThe problem is I'm not so sure I'm enamored with the curriculum anymore (software/web/mobile development in popular frameworks) both because I'm not sure I want to risk spending the rest of my life working as a \"code monkey\" and because I've found I'm pretty good at picking up things like this through self-study and faster than I would in a classroom environment.\n\nThere is also a program (3 year Advanced Diploma) at the same school in [Cyber Security](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/cyb1-cyber-security/next) that strikes me as genuinely interesting. The impression I have is that I would have a less common skill set at the end of those 3 years than if I had pursued the other program and I think the work would be more interesting to me. It would be a nice thing to pair with my current knowledge of webdev/programming and I could work on picking up an extra skill or two in the 3 years I'd be in the program.\n\nMy problem is I have virtually no sense whatsoever of what the Diploma is worth. I'm confident I would learn a lot, but I don't know if I would end up with a useless scrap of paper for my efforts.\n\nAnyone have any words of wisdom?\n\nThank you",

        "text": "Hmms eems this post was destoryed. Reposting:\nA Call for Participation in a Research Study\n\nThe research topic:\n\nCybersecurity of Internet of Things devices within an industrial environment\n\nThe research problem:\n\nThe systems that make up every level of the Internet of Things (IoT) have rapidly been assimilated into critical and essential roles in daily lives. As the entire ecosystem of the IoT evolves and expands, the wide range of functions and supporting components involved are resulting in significant security and ultimately privacy challenges that need to be addressed. The Industrial applications of IoT (IIoT) also referred as Industry 4.0 (Schwab, 2017) suffer from very similar security and privacy concerns as implementations that expand existing Operational Technologies (OT) networks through the interconnection of smart sensors and actuators with integrations into cloud computing platforms to create intelligent infrastructures create vital links within energy, transportation, manufacturing and automation.\n\nThe Research Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the proposed qualitative study is to explore, the experiences of cyber-security professionals who have practical knowledge in implementing Industrial Internet of Things systems and devices and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems, giving rise to a better understanding of the security and privacy concerns that must be overcome.\n\nThe research question:\n\nWhat are the experiences of cyber-security professionals who have implemented Industrial Internet of Things systems and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems? This exploration may lead to a better understanding of the security implications of a technology that is rapidly growing but is overlooked within Industrial Control Systems due to a false sense of security.\n\nResearch study participation:\n\nFor data collection, this research study needs at least 10 participants for semi-structured interviews with an additional 2 for a pilot phase to fine tune the questions. The interviews will be conducted via Skype video conference calls in a nationwide scope. The primary focus of participants will be individuals who currently work within the manufacturing industries. Additionally, participants should be identifiable cybersecurity professionals. Each participant will answer about 10 interview questions. Interviews will likely be no longer than one hour.\n\nBenefits of Participation\n\nThere may or may not be a direct benefit to participants in the study, but we hope to further the knowledge required to implement IoT Devices into industrial settings that will help organizations to improve their security posture that could indirectly benefit everyone. Your contribution will be recognized and acknowledged in the dissertation.\n\nYou will receive the following payment/reimbursement: $25 Amazon Gift Card for participation, presentable upon completion of the interview.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nDuring the data collection and data analysis, every effort will be made to ensure that participants of the study will in no way be able to correlate their responses to their identity; the information will be coded to mask participants identities and ensure the confidentiality of the respondents. The data and records will be stored within an encrypted offline medium, and this will be stored within a locked container. Only the researcher will be allowed access to the data and the records, and once the study is complete, the data and records will be securely destroyed.\n\nContact information:\n\nIf you would like to participate in this research study or functions as a pilot for the questions or have any other questions regarding this study, you may contact Patrick Butler at\n\n- Cell phone number: 201-873-4938\n\n- Email address: patrick.butler1@student.ctuonline.edu or patrick.butler@gmail.com\n\n- Linkedin social media network: r/https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickmbutler/\n\nFor questions regard the rights of research subjects, any complaints or comments regarding the manner in which the study is being conducted, you may contact Colorado Technical University – Doctoral Programs at 719-598-0200.\nReferences\n\nSchwab, K.

Going through all accounts possibly using that password and replacing with randomly generated Lastpass (shouldn't be many though).

Then I tried to execute this command:\n\n`gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89`\n\nIn return, I got this error:\n\n`gpg: WARNING: server 'dirmngr' is older than us (2.2.4 &lt; 2.2.9)`\n\n`gpg: Note: Outdated servers may lack important security fixes.`\n\n`gpg: Note: Use the command \"gpgconf --kill all\" to restart them.`\n\n`gpg: keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure`\n\nThe \"kill all\" command did not help and I can't find anything useful on Google.\n\nCan anyone help me out?",

Say my machine gets infected, blue screens, or otherwise fucks up. If I were to replace every file (a second computer interacting with my hard drive) that has changed since 1 minute before the issue began (or however long needed to prevent the issue from occurring again, up to 1 hour). Would this effectively restore my machine to a safe state, like a much faster system restore? Sorry if it doesn’t make sense, please let me know if I need to clarify anything. Thanks in advance. ",

        "text": "Something I see a lot is that there's very little entry positions. The positions that are low experience requirements (such as 3 minimum or 5 minimum) usually want pre-existing experience with tools. Enterprise level tools like vendor specific SIEMs, next gen firewalls, etc.\n\nSadly, a lot of these things are not cheap. Not only that, but even if people buy them they may not have the capabilities to really use them. So all we can do is read about them, not really get any hands on experience.\n\nThere are some courses and certification training things you can take, but again these are not uncommonly expensive. Especially when you're asking someone who is new to the industry to do it.\n\nYes I've heard it before. Do another role first. I'm in pretty much a low level Sysadmin position/help desk position right now. I do a lot of work, but I don't see any chance of getting experience with these tools that I'm seeing a lot of cybersecurity positions requesting. Most job reqs I'm reading for things I'm \"qualified\" for don't indicate the chance to work with these. Trying to find an entry level network engineer position isn't much better either.\n\nSo are there any free tools out there that can give users some hands on experience (and real life scenario training) to enterprise level tools.

So I started with writing a program that connects to sites and requests html files through a GET message so then I would use them in my fake version of the website. What surprised me is when trying this little piece of program against thepiratebay.org I get a weird looking string. Also some time later after getting that string I installed a tcp/ip client on my phone and after connecting to thepiratebay.org and writing the http message manually I get a non ending row of messages that look like this:\n&lt;23.14 - 29.8.18&gt; server : null\nThen the tcp/ip Android app freezes.\nIs this some sort of a way on defending against crawling bots through buffer overflow crashes?\nI know how thepiratebay's reputation isn't so good.\nSo could what I am assuming be true?",
