        "text": "I am a 16 year old high school student. I have an extreme interest in this sort of field and have decided to seek the opinions of those on this subreddit regarding some of my thoughts. I know as a 16 year old my ideas will probably be seen as invalid, but I would appreciate it if you continue. If this is not the right subreddit or doing this is wrong, I'd happily go to another. For those who may be interested in my insane thoughts, feel free to continue.\n\nThe past few years of high school science courses of chemistry and physics, as well as some college level astronomy courses, has inspired many crazy ideas and deep thoughts. My main interests go all the way from subatomic processes to black holes. Probably my biggest idea involves a direct comparison between atomic and galactic structure. (Yes, I know I sound insane)\n\nMy intention is to go from the center of the atom/galaxy outward. To start, we think that most galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their cores. Something I've found odd is how exactly the nucles of an atoms can hold itself together even though the particles are either positively charged (protons) or have neutral charge (neutrons). I've heard its the \"strong nuclear force\" that binds these particle together, but I still don't understand how. Its like a bunch of mass is jammed into a tiny space (in comparison to the amount of mass) similar to how we believe black holes are created. Regarding the neutrons, we don't really know anything that they do apart from increase the mass of an atom. I think it could be correlated to dark matter, given that they don't really seem to have an origin or any observable effect besides mass. Given how much of the universe we think is dark matter and its lack of other effects, it seems reasonable to me that it could be a primary source of a black hole's mass. \nI think that's plenty about the center, but I could go on more. Moving outward, we get to the main source of light in the center of the galaxy, being stars and hot gases within close proximity of the black hole. Something interesting I noticed about atoms is that photons (light) are given off when an electron returns to its ground state, its lowest possible energy level. I'm aware that light is given off all throughout a galaxy via stars and such, which is exactly why it makes sense. An insanely massive nucleus could hold an insane amount of electrons and therefore requires more space for all of this to occur. \nThis leads directly into my next part about the galactic arms and halo. The galactic arms are waves of gas that are light enough to be pulled around easily because of its lesser mass compared to the stars that can occur within the arms, but fall out because they're too massive. The halo is a spherical region all around the galaxy that extends beyond the galactic disk that contains all kinds of stars that are typically far older and dimmer than those within the disk. These two formations are important because of their comparability to the s and p sublevels of electron energy levels. The s sublevel is thought to be spherical in shape and exists in all energy levels of an atom, thus making it comparable to the halo. The p sublevel is thought to be, as I've heard it described, \"dumbbell\"-ish in shape and carries more electrons than the s sublevel. The arms of a spiral galaxy could be somewhat comparable to a dumbbell, but it is a bit of a stretch. But this is where orbitals within sublevels come into play. The three orbitals of a p sublevel occur on the x, y, and z axes, which means it takes a three dimensional shape. Some black holes will have a sort of jet shooting vertically both ways away from the black hole perpendicular to its implied rotational direction given by the actions of the objects orbiting it. I think those might be quasars are something like that, but thats something I'll have to research more into. It is possible that other galactic formations could be comparable to the other two sublevels (d and f) but this is reaching the limit of my knowledge. I also think there are some of these parallels visible in the formation of solar systems, given the Oort Cloud as a sort of halo/electron cloud, the planets and asteroid belts like the disk, and the Sun as the center mass/black hole/nucleus.\n\nIf anything was wrong or if you have any other feedback, I would appreciate your comment. I just thought this would be a good place to reach out to for any opinions, given that this is a kinda niche and very complex field.",

        "text": "I don't know if this is the right place or if anybody here will be able to help with such a fake scenario but I'll try anyway. So I am in a process of a little project of mine where I came up with my own system but it's geocentric.\n\nI need help with just visualising moon phases if there would be any in that case, because I don't really know how would it work in that kind of setting. Just explaining how it works and how would it work in that case would be really helpful. You can also point out any things that have no sense here and couldn't work for that system in any logical way, however this project is just for my hobby purposes and I don't mind if it's a bit of a nonsense.\n\nSo there is a cylindrical planet, basically just a huge cyllinder in the center of the system. It has a radius of about 16000 km and height of 96000km. There is also a sun (sphere, radius 2500 km) orbiring on an orbit (90°) at the distance of 300000 km from the axis of the cylinder. There are two moons: moon 1 (radius 2500 km, orbit at 90°) and moon 2 (radius 1250km, orbit tilted 20°) orbiting moon 1. Complete orbit of the sun takes 30h, of the moon 1—15h, and of the moon 2—2h. The cylinder doesn't move, the sun and the moons also don't have any rotation around their axes. Everything orbits counterclockwise. I will provide rough visualisation of all of that.\n\nI know it may sound like a lot of bullshit, but I just really wanna know if there would be any lunar phases, any month-like way of measuring time, or whatever. The cylinder doesn't have neither its own rotation nor doesn't orbit anything so I have no clue how would it work. I wasted all my imagination on figuring out measurements and all so it could make at least a bit of sense, but now I'm stuck. Maybe somebody wanna mess around with this wild scenario and help? Huge thanks in advance!\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/n6AnLDa) is a gif of the system but with fucked up measurements, and [here](https://youtu.be/bxNCrSAffyY) is an animation (forgot to tilt the orbit of moon 2 tho) if this will be of any help",

Wouldn't there be a speed at which that expansion happened, therefore the universe wouldn't be infinite because it has only expanded at a certain speed in a certain amount of time from a certain point. \n\nAlso, wouldn't there be a limit to the amount of energy/matter that came from the expansion point? So you would have a finite amount of \"stuff\" in a finite space. \n\nOn the other hand if the beginning was infinitely dense and there is infinite matter then the universe would have to be infinite for any of it to be moving away from each other wouldn't it? Infinite matter in finite space would still be infinite no matter how large the space was? But then how has the space gone from infinitely small to infinitely large in a finite amount of time?\n\nKind of a handful of questions but I just wanna have an understanding of this. I know at some point we just don't know for sure but I'm struggling to understand how an infinite universe is a seriously considered possibility.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I wont go into exact details, but I was given an Christian apologetics book by my father called \"Why The Universe Is the Way It Is\" by Hugh Ross. \n\nHugh Ross is an astrophysicist so some of the book is over my head to refute.  Ill post part of the chapter here. Essentially in this chapter, Ross is making a claim that the universe was fine-tuned for us, and that we live in the only hospitable part of the planet and that there is no chance for other intelligent life. I do not believe this to be true, but I am not an astrophysicist, so I'm not sure what research I need to be looking at. Please see below: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'The Milky Way Galaxy finds itself in a tiny cluster of galaxies without any giants or supergiants nearby and where the galaxies are widely dispersed. A typical galaxy cluster contains more than 10,000 closely packed galaxies. The Milky Way’s cluster, called “the Local Group,” contains only about forty galaxies—two medium-sized (Andromeda and the Milky Way) and the rest small or dwarf. Here the Goldilocks principle of being “just right” becomes even more obvious. The Local Group  is spread apart in such a way that the Milky Way’s spiral structure remains largely undisturbed—an important requirement for the possibility of harboring advanced life. At the same time, the Local Group contains a sufficient number of the smaller dwarf galaxies to sustain the spiral structure of the Milky Way. (Star formation drives the spiral arm structure, and the infusion of gas and dust from dwarf galaxies keeps the star formation rate high enough.) Unless Earth’s galaxy absorbs a smallish dwarf galaxy about once every half-billion to one billion years, its spiral structure will inevitably collapse. \n\n Not only do galaxies reside in clusters, the clusters themselves exist in clusters of clusters called superclusters. Here again, Earth’s location favors life’s needs. The Local Group sits on the extreme outer fringe of the Virgo supercluster. If it were closer to the middle, Virgo’s mostly massive clusters would disrupt the Local Group or swallow it up. Either way, its suitability for life would be destroyed. \n\n Astronomers’ discoveries about the rarity of life-habitable locations in the universe challenge Enrico Fermi’s proposition that the cosmos could be filled with inhabitants. While Earth’s location is not geographically central to the solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, or galaxy supercluster, it deserves the description “spectacularly favored” for life. Perhaps Someone had a purpose or purposes in mind for limiting life to just one residence.\n\n Real estate brokers often say the key to property value is location, location, location. If this principle applies to the cosmic scene, Earth’s location would be considered way beyond “prime.” No amount of money could buy it. Earth appears to reside in the only neighborhood in the universe where humans can exist and thrive long enough to enjoy a global, high-tech civilization and to discover how rare they are.'",

        "text": "I am a university student in the last year of my Bachelor's degree (year 3). Currently, I am trying to simulate the solar system i 2D using Python. It works pretty well; the orbits of the planets look stable and the total energy is conserved over time (although it oscillates quite a bit when looking closer). However, I would like to improve the conservation of energy and be able to plot Poincaré maps. \n\nIn the simulation, velocity and position of each planet, in the x and y directions seperately, is updated using one of the integrators I will soon mention. The total force and energy is calculated from all the other planets using the classical formulas for gravity.\n\nFor integration, I have tried numerical methods Symplectic Euler, Verlet integration, and Runge-Kutta 4. They all work pretty well, but I get some fluctuations in the total energy (relatively small to the energy in the system but still on the magnitude 10^31 J), which seems to mess up my values enough that my Poincaré maps do not produce nice patterns. Maybe my implementations are somewhat wrong. If someone feel like they know how to do this, I can PM my code.\n\nFor the Poincaré maps, I am plotting a planet's distance to the sun against it's momentum at the same point each revolution around the sun. I get som pretty nice lines in the beginning, but with time, the distance and momentum seem to decrease indefinely. Any ideas how to do this better?\n\nThis post might be a bit unclear so to further clarify what I really mean, I can provide graphs and code (probably easiest in PM), so feel free to PM me if you feel like you could help! Thanks in advance!",

That said, here is my quandary:\n\nWhen the average person (like me) thinks of a black hole, they think of the large elements out in various galactic bodies, threatening to devour nearby planets. However, I know most of you are aware that tiny black holes are also created when certain atoms collide together at the LHC. Given that black holes are theorized to be essentially the entry gates to other dimensions, I have the following questions:\n\n1) What would be the most feasible way to set up some form of containment field to prevent the collapse of those tiny black holes?\n2) If one could be stabilized, what theoretical approaches could be used to stabilize the black hole to prevent damage in the room that holds it?\n3) If someone/thing were to manage to travel through the black hole (again, it’s fiction, so don’t go too crazy here), what would they likely be greeted by on the other side? A white hole? A inverse world of ours? A whole different part of the multiverse?\n\nThanks in advance. I know this probably isn’t what this subreddit is for, but I’ve had these poor people stuck in my head for a decade now, and it’s time I save their universe!",

If someone says they have -1 apples, we can conceptualize that in a useful way. But there's no such thing as negative apples. You either have none, or one, or more than one. But you can't have negative apples. Trying to map that concept onto our physical reality does not work.\n\nSo my question is: Setting aside the mathematics of general relativity, what other information do we have do consider wormholes even a remote possibility in the reality we occupy? Is it just fun sci-fi conjecture, or is there a real chance these things exist?",

Discovering their Xseries about astrophysics was mindblowing. I had never dreamed of being able to learn something beyond what they usually teach in videos or books.\nI did not have the chance to study physics/astrophysics, so this online course really felt as close to that as possible.\n\nI lost part of my motivation, when I noticed that missing a suggested turn in date did not have any consequences and that successfully completing the first course did only trigger an automated message with a certificate that does not even show how well you did... But after watching a documentary on Netflix, I went back to the course and am having a blast again right now.\n\nNow my question would be: Do you know of any other online courses about astrophysics/cosmology that people without any degrees can do? I really like that with EDX there is graded homework included, because this reall motivates me. So having something like that would be amazing. Being able to get a certificate also motivates me, but I guess that they all \"don't really matter\" anyways.\n\nThank you all very much in advance!\n\nHave a great holiday season!\n\nBest regards,\nHaldur",
