        "text": "Hello everyone\n\nLast week I started my journey into the world of philosophy by reading The Apology by Plato and listening to two podcasts on the subject (The Partially Examined Life, HoP).\n\nWhile I find it very interesting (reading Phaedon now), I do feel like I'm struggling to retain the key ideas of the text I read, which is a bit disappointing. I'm not saying I need to be able to quote passages from memory but I also don't want to lose any valuable lessons/insights I'm learning.\n\nSo my question is, for someone new to philosophy, who is 35, has a day job and some other hobbies, what can I do to make my time investment in anything philosophy as worthwhile as possible.\n\nI was thinking of creating flashcards, since I followed a course on learning how to learn that advocated spaced repetition but then I was a bit paralyzed since there is so much to put into flashcards that is probably not worth it? Like, do I need to know what the oracle said about Socrates or not? \n\nI do have more of an auditive memory and I tried to read parts of The Apology out loud to make it stick more, but beyond that I don't have a good approach to continue my education.\n\nAny advice would be deeply appreciated, especially by people who maybe also have a more auditive memory.\n\nKind regards and happy new year!",

        "text": "Hello, I have a question about nihilism that I am not sure if I am formulating well, but maybe you can correct me or try to understand my main point. \n\nI have been seeing some supposedly nihilists argue that the universe does not care about our existence, and therefore life has no meaning. First of all, is this a correct stance?\n\nSecondly, I don't really understand the point of this argument. Why would the universe, that according to our knowledge is made out of inanimate objects, help determine if life has meaning or not? Shouldn't meaning be solely a human characteristic that begins and ends in the human world? \n\nWhy does it matter that a collection of rocks does not care about human life, if the only thing that matters when it comes to meaning are other humans? Isn't this just a reaction to the lack of religious belief, supposing that the only condition for meaning in life would be a God that cares?\n\nFor example, people can argue that, in the long run, some things are irrelevant or that people can be immoral without consequences because the universe does not care, but how does this make sense? Why would it care? Don't they mean that they are just free from some sort of divine punishment, and the divine existence was the only thing that would give meaning to life? I don't think it says anything about life's meaning at all. Moral or immoral acts do mean a lot to other people and they are the only thing that are affected by other's decisions, so what is the point of bringing the Universe into the conversation?\n\nNihilism seems to be a reaction to the death of God, but what if you always attributed meaning to life without ever needing God for it in the first place?\n\nAre there any philosophers who are against the type of arguments given by nihilists, even if they are different from the ones I tried to use? I am not looking for religious texts, but rather authors that might argue how nihilism is irrelevant, in case there are some. Thanks",

For example, when Heidegger writes in §15:\n\n&gt;In der Erschließung und Explikation des Seins ist das Seiende jeweils das Vor- und Mitthematische, im eigentlichen Thema steht das Sein. Im Bezirk der jetzigen Analyse ist als das vorthe- matische Seiende das angesetzt, das im umweltlichen Besorgen sich zeigt.\n\nin French (Martineau):\n\n&gt;Dans l’ouverture et l’explication de l’être, l’étant est toujours pré-et co-thématique, tandis que c’est l’être qui constitue le thème proprement dit. Dans le champ de la présente analyse, est pris pour étant pré-thématique celui qui se montre dans la préoccupation au sein du monde ambiant.\n\nin English (Stambaugh):\n\n&gt;In the disclosure and explication of being, beings are always our preliminary and accompanying theme. The real theme is being. What shows itself in taking care of things in the surrounding world constitues the pre-thematic being in the domain of our analysis.\n\nI understand what he does in this chapter, but I don't understand this particular point of vocabulary. The commentators don't talk about it, like it's something that's obvious for them I suppose. The English translation is a bit more precise in the meaning of the word, but that remains vague for me.\n\nCan you help? Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hi! Just found out, based on my interpretation of Kant's Prolegomena, that there is a fundamental difference between the concepts of  perception and experience in Kant. What I understand here is that perception is basically just raw intuition appearing before us. We can make judgment about perception but ultimately, it doesn't have objective or universal validity as the judgment would be synthetic a posteriori. But from judgment about perception, understanding can come in and make the judgment objective with a universal validity, therefore synthetic a priori. After understanding comes in, it no longer is a judgment about perception, rather a judgment about experience. Kant also mentioned that the pure concepts of understanding connects our perception of an object to everyone else's perception (it becomes experience), I find it interesting because to me it seems as if Kant already have a vague concept of intersubjectivity even before Husserl or Heidegger or Wittgenstein. Any Kant expert would like to chime in?",

In this sense humans can be thought of as deterministic machines, with our stimuli and prior knowledge of the world causing some response. We see evidence of this especially now with neural networks, which are optimised deterministic functions in the mathematical theory of machine learning, and how close they have come to imitating certain human behaviours.My question is this: if a human body (including its brain) is a deterministic machine, why does our consciousness exist within this deterministic machine in the sense that we are mere observers of how our body perceives stimuli, how our brain reasons with it and subsequently how it reacts, given that this deterministic machine can of course run autonomously without our consciousness just sitting there watching it. I would love to know any flaws in this line of reasoning, or any theories consistent with it as this has been on my mind for days now. Thank you!",

        "text": "Upon growing up a bit, I realized that being a libertarian was just an emotional ego statement. I couldn’t even finish Atlas Shrugged. It's prob one of the boringest books I've ever picked up. Well composed enough but the content was mind numbing. I've largely written off this school of thought as a feisty adolescent wet dream. \"I do what I want.\"\n\nThough, there are elements of righteousness, in practice we can see there's no place that proves by example it's value and the maximal path that it leads one to of \"anarchy\" is just as max ally absurd and almost a pathetic position to hold in this day and age. For more than a number of reasons \n\nBut I would like to understand the full extent of the arguments and be able to steal man the school of thought myself, since woefully, most normal people can't even hold a candle in debate on these topics. That being said, I've never in person or threw communication of ideas threw any other medium, found anyone doing much service to the ideas. So typically that's not a red herring. One only needs to watch a libertarian party debate conference / primary to examine the mindlessness of its ideas being flaunted in just words not even practice.\n\nNow, so I don't offend people with this proclamation as well... I'm a very mixed hybrid type person. I like our model now but seek to erode the corruptive perverse incentives by\nhaving a melting pot of ideas to push back from all angles. Keeping any one side in check by the\nvoice and existence of the polarity. \n\nThere are some libertarians principles and critiques of the modern world that are spot on (which 'happen' to be correct - often for different reasons - like math the work must be shown) and I'm glad we have people tuned from all ranges of belief to illustrate\nthese pit falls. That being said, of course the current social maelstrom is far beyond driven in more toxic paths with ill intended course (largely because of perverse incentives). We can’t afford to lose ourselves in a paradox of intolerance and must educate on the basic precursors (the whys not just the how) for the system to be the fittest of all, despite its many short comings and failures. People tend to be the problem not the systems. As many different systems work for many different specific reasons, more or less. \n\nAnd to be even more clear. I sort of see this maxim, as a starting point to work back from in a way; as a place to derive ideal but then to be rationale and realist with trade offs /cost and benefits. Agian a range of models: (what I call) soft deontology that’s subjectively judicious and relative, that’s originally guided by utilitarianism and virtue ethics with a smearing over stroke of pragmatism and prudence. (In brief).\n\nThe suggestion I heard recently was I should have done the \"Fountain Head\" first. I worry that if it’s anywhere near the dribble that Atlas Shrugged was, that I won’t manage to get even 1/2 way threw. Any YouTube links, podcast, lectures (I'm more of an audio learning person) or conceptual ways to consider it\nwould he greatly appreciated. ✌🏼",

This 'began to exist' twenty or so years ago and will persist for another eighty or so. Here's the issue, where would a continuous stream of consciousness fit into this? What exactly is the through line that has been present for my entire life? It seems wrong to say that there has been some individual having some experience through all of this.\n\nSuppose my body is ripped apart atom by atom while another group of carbon atoms spontaneously forms in the exact structure of me. This second entity would be indistinguishable from me, literally. This would mean that my conscious experience persists, yet I know that it wouldn't, because how can it? \n\nA much cleaner metaphysic would be to say that there is no single conscious entity, there is simply a system with different parts working together that sometimes has similar feelings. I do not see how a single unified conscious entity could emerge from all this chaos.\n\nIf my suspicions about this are correct, it would have huge implications. It would mean that for the same reason I prioritise my well-being over that of others (I have no issue spending hundreds of pounds on PC parts when I know there are people starving who could be saved for a fraction of that amount), I should prioritize my short term pleasure over my long term pleasure. If I gain in the long term that isn't actually me gaining anything, it is a discrete collection of molecules similar to what I call me, but it isn't actually me.",

        "text": "Hegel was utterly inept at basic arithmetic and physics. \nIn Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, he proves that the prerequisites for experience are the pure intuitions of space and time. But he makes particular errors in regard to causal law and how perception comes to be. We must start with examining sensuous knowledge. – A tree standing before me casts the light rays hitting it back linearly. A few of them fall on my eye and make an impression on the retina, which is transmitted to the brain by the stimulated optic nerve. When touching a stone, the sensory Nerves direct the received sensations to the brain. A bird sings and thereby brings forth a wave motion in the air. A few waves reach my ear, the eardrum vibrates, and the auditory nerve transmits the impression to the brain. While eating some fruit it affects my taste buds, and they lead the impression to the brain. Thus, there are visual representations, in contrast to those representations that are not visible such as those based off touch, taste, smell, and hearing. The visualizable representation starts with an impression which is made on the eye, for example when I have looked at the tree. There has been a certain alteration on the retina of my eye, and this has notified my brain, if nothing else happens then the process would end here, for how could the weak change in my nerves be processed into a tree, and by what miraculous manner could I see it? But in actuality, the brain reacts to the impression, and the faculty which we called the understanding, becomes active. The understanding searches the cause of the change in the sense organ, and the transition of effect in the sense organ to the cause is its sole function, it is the causal law. If the brain did not react to changes in the sense organ with the function of the understanding, there would be no representation of the world; thus the causal law is a priori, it is possibility for representation and lies a priori within us.\n\nSensation that is not based of objective intuition is nothing but a local, specific feeling, capable in it’s own way some variation, but is always subjective and so is different to an intuition. Sensations are a process within the organism itself and is therefore wholly subjective, touch, sight and smell present themselves as external causes but do not determine any spatial relationships. Thus, we cannot determine any objective intuitions based on the aforementioned sensations, we can never construct a rose based of it’s smell nor can a blind person whom listens to music his entire life construct the image of a human being. If that same blind person were to feel a cubical body, the sensation of hardness, softness, dryness, moisture and temperature are not enough to determine the perceptual image of a construction; thus if said blind person were to feel the uniform and dimensions that are the same length, and that the edges press parts of his hands, the sensation of mere hardness does not construct anything similar to a cube. For hardness can refer to various types of objects, but the understanding which detects a change in the sense organ, immediately constructs a firm body and a cubical shape due to the pure intuitions of space and time. The inborn a priori function of causality finds it’s proof in the achievements of blind people such as Nicholas Saunderson who was blind from childhood but excelled in mathematics, optics and astronomy. The sensation of the retina can be reduced to light and dark, without the understanding we would have no ability to discern the proximity of objects and their spatial determinations thus only a meaningless array of sense data would be present to the consciousness. It is well known that light entering the eye is refracted as it passes through the cornea until both the cornea and lens act together as compound lens to project an inverted image, if vision was merely sensation the image would be reversed, however the understanding immediately at once detects a change in the retina from the direction that a light ray arrives it thus follows backwards in the position backwards on both lines to the cause. Thus the understanding is intuitive in contrast to discursive and abstract and causality creates from the heterogenous a priori intuitions of space and time the cerebral phenomena of the objective world, cognition of the understanding is completely different to introspective discursive thought, as can be seen in optical illusions where the understanding may have double vision, but reason cannot come to the aid of the understanding as it is merely abstract and diverged from it. Kant did not recognize that for them to be perception causality must be a priori in order for a change in the sense organ to be registered in the brain. Thus the 12 categories are wholly superfluous and discursive abstract thinking is not needed in immediate perception, this is seen above in the presence of optical illusions wherein reason may think that what is being presented is illusory but is the understanding does not budge. Because the law of causality is a priori we are not allowed to use causality to things-in-themselves. Thus matter is the causal law objectified, and the law of causality brings two important corollaries namely the law of inertia and that matter can never be destroyed or created. With this rigorous proof of the law of causality that is a priori, I will now showcase the incredible stupidity of Hegel. “The babble-philosophers, Jacobi at their head, to that reason that apprehends the ‘supersensible’ immediately, and to the absurd assertion that reason was a faculty essentially aimed at things beyond all experience, and so at metaphysics, and that it immediately and intuitively cognized the ultimate grounds of all things and all existence, the supersensible, the absolute, the deity and such like. – If people had been willing to use their reason instead of deifying it, such assertions would have had to be countered long ago by the simple observation that, if a human being, enabled by a special organ for solving the riddle of the world, which constituted his reason, carried within himself an innate metaphysics that merely stood in need of development, then as complete a unanimity concerning the objects of metaphysics would have to prevail among human beings as concerning the truths of arithmetic and geometry.” - Schopenhauer, The two fundamental problems of ethics. “An example of the existent specification of gravity is furnished by the following phenomenon: when a bar of iron, evenly balanced on its fulcrum, is magnetized, it loses its equilibrium and shows itself to be heavier at one pole than at the other. Here the one part is so affected that without changing its volume it becomes heavier; the matter, without increase in its mass, has thus become specifically heavier.” - §293 Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences\n\nHegel makes the following inference: “If a bar supported at its centre of gravity subsequently becomes heavier on one side, then it falls to that side; but an iron bar falls to one side once it has been magnetized: therefore it has become heavier in that place.” It is comparable to this: “All geese have two legs, you have two legs, therefore you are a goose.’ The Hegelian syllogism reads: ‘Everything that becomes heavier on one side falls to that side; this magnetized bar falls to one side: therefore it has become heavier in that place.’ ‘Gravitation directly contradicts the law of inertia; for, by virtue of the former, matter strives to get away out of itself to an Other.’ - §269 Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences Well not only was this a stupid claim to make at the time, Einstein would show the identity of inert and gravitating mass. If you still doubt that Hegel was anything but an absolute idiot who was nothing more then a prostitute for the Prussian government consider the following example: ‘True, it is admitted in the abstract that matter is perishable, not absolute, yet in practice this admission is resisted, . . . ; so that in point of fact, matter is regarded as absolutely self-subsistent, eternal. This error springs from the general error of the understanding, that etc.’ -§298 Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences The Law of the Conservation of Matter is well understood by mere schoolchildren, even imagining the sudden creation of matter is impossible for us it can only undergo alterations as the law of causality is a priori, otherwise our sense-organ would not detect any change. And thus Hegel’s philosophical method’s which is nothing but Spinozism wrapped up in all sorts of prolixity whereby Spinoza’s substance was coined the “Absolute”, except it is now unconscious and needs to realise itself through history which amounts to “we’re all supernatural spiritual being realising itself through history,” were to have any merit at all – he would’ve been able to learn basic physics and math, no wonder he hated Newton, he was probably to stupid to do basic arithmetic. Compare him with Schopenhauer’s scientific anticipation, where he has the likes of Einstein, Schrodinger, Wolfgang Pauli and Charles Darwin praising his work.",

        "text": "I have been interested in philosophy for about a year now, and I finally decided that I want to start learning about philosophy. I have just started this course and in it, they talk about identity and what an object's identity is. They talk about Max Black's counterexample of the Identity of Indiscernibles: suppose there is a universe within it two solid gold spheres of the same isotope, same size, etc. everything is the same, now you would say that there are two spheres and not 1.\n\nCouldn't it be said that position is a property of an object, so that the spheres are not the same, because they do not have the same position? I have been thinking of some counterexamples but I could not think of any good ones.\n\nThe first one was: I can move around in my car, and the car is still the same, but that assumes there is some ultimate reference point from which position is to be measured. If I chose the reference point from the car, this point would move with the car, so it would be like the car hadn't moved at all. The world around it moved. In the situation of the two solid gold spheres, there could be no reference point from which the spheres are in the same position, so they are not the same.\n\nAnother possible counterexample would be that an object has a size so that it can hold multiple positions, but then I would say something is only one object if it has a continuous position, meaning that one could move a point throughout the object without ever having to jump through space, this would mean that if both spheres melted together one could move a point from one sphere to the other without jumping through space so what were previously two spheres has now melted into one object.\n\nDoes this make sense or is there anything obvious that I missed? This is my first time thinking about something like this.",

        "text": "Before I get going, I just want to note that I don't believe in the supernatural and the best of my knowledge there is zero scientific evidence that any supernatural event has ever occurred. To me and my novice understanding of the topic, this seems like an interesting and maybe slightly humourous approach to the problem of evil. Now ... from what I've read (and from answers on here), I think the leading reasons given for an orthodoxly conceived monotheistic God allowing evil are: that humans can commit evil acts because that is part of having free will, and that natural evil events are permitted because; they are just part of events that have been set in motion, and/or they will lead to a greater good. On a related note, it is generally accepted that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that God is real. I think the leading explanation for this is that if God was to leave evidence of his existence then that would impinge on the free will of humans to the extent where they couldn't really choose willingly to believe in and follow the rules of the God. Now, the combination of the above leads me, personally to the conclusion that if God was real then they do not intervene in human affairs. \n\nNow how does the devil fit into this situation? From popular conception, the devil is a thinking being with supernatural powers, and seemingly a free will of his own. As one of the mainstream churches, the Catholic church does seem to both train priests in exocisms, and perform exocisms. This would imply that they have a belief in the devil and his ability to possess individual humans as part of their doctrine. \n\nThen hypothetically, we've got: Evidence of the supernatural, An evil being having free will, An evil being who is permitted to do evil acts, and An evil being who interferes in human affairs. I could go on for a while, but I'll try to limit this to what I think are the two big ones.\n\nTo me, it seems that during a human possession, the devil almost couldn't help to leave evidence of his existence behind. But then why would the God allow the devil to leave verifiable traces of his existence? If it was to encourage people to believe, it does not seem like a benevolent thing to do. Instead the God could provide peaceful and kind evidence of himself, not allow someone else to provide frightening evidence. In addition, if evidence of God infringes on the free will of humans, doesn't evidence of an evil supernatural being also infringe on our free will? If we new the devil was real, wouldn't that lead more people to believe in God when they wouldn't otherwise?\n\nWhy would a completely benevolent supernatural being allow another supernatural being of lesser power to do evil acts? This seems like a different question to human evil and natural evil. Why would a three O's God who does not interfere in human affairs for good reasons allow a lesser supernatural being to interfere? Why would a three O's God allow an evil supernatural being to exist at all, don't us humans have enough to deal with between human generated evil and natural evil?",

John is the only person to win. The correct number was 220.\n\nIntuitively, the first scenario seems more unrepresentative and less amenable to chance. After all, someone winning after one try is much less likely than someone winning after many. Most would not suspect anything weird with the latter scenario.\n\nHowever, usually when we consider something to be less amenable to chance, it is because we expect it to be designed. For example, if one saw the letters \"AIHOIWEJ\" on a table, most would think they were randomly scrambled. If one instead saw the letters \"LOVELY\", most would think those letters were not randomly scrambled. This is because a designer is more likely to arrange the letters \"LOVELY\" than \"AIHOIWEJ\". Clearly P(\"AIHOIWEJ\"|DESIGN) is less than P(\"LOVELY\"|DESIGN) even though, assuming each letter is equally likely, P(\"AIHOIWEJ\"|RANDOM SCRAMBLING) = P(\"LOVELY\"|RANDOM SCRAMBLING)\n\nIn the case of the two scenarios, the way it would potentially be designed is if the game was rigged or John cheated (unless you want to entertain some supernatural hypothesis such as telepathy). Either way, it is not clear that P(John winning once with no other people attempting it|RIGGED) &gt; P(John winning once with everyone else failing|RIGGED). In fact, one may even argue that if John wanted to rig the competition, he may even have more incentive to rig it **after** other people have already played. In other words, it may even be **more** likely that it was rigged in scenario B than scenario A **because** of this very same intuition. And yet, scenario A is the same scenario that, to our intuition, seems more off. Why is this?",

Is it common to make novel contributions (in math, undergraduate research I believe tends to focus on relatively insignificant, but novel, problems/generalizations), is it focused on meta-analysis, is it more-so the application of techniques from a philosopher to topics they might not have considered or cared about, researching esoteric scholastics, etc.? I'd like to know so that I'm not overstepping my abilities and trying to do more than is reasonable, and also to have a clearer goal.\n\nSecondly, as from the title, I'd like to know some topics/areas an undergraduate who might not have the same extant knowledge as a grad/professor would be able to handle. For example, maybe new topics that aren't as fleshed out (I'm not sure if this is a great example, but something like common knowledge epistemology)? There's not much I'm disinterested in, but so I'm not being too general, I typically avoid political philosophy and \"philosophy of science/psychology/etc.\". Philosophy of math is an exception.\n\nMy school does grant programs for undergraduate research with an advisor, and is an R1 institute, so I do have a lot of resources. Any advice is appreciated.",

That is by carefully reading their works, secondary literature about them, and perhaps writing short essays.\n\nSo, it is short of a full Specialization, which takes a lifetime, but more than merely reading their works.\n\nIf using the \"number of Philosophers-per-lifetime\" as a unit of quantity is inaccurate for you, you can replace it with \"number of Books\", or another unit. All is merely for rough approximations &amp; sake of clarification.\n\nWith this all aside. My question:\n\nIs it a recommended, or a bad approach, to spread these 15 figures across several scarcely related traditions &amp; topics? \n\nMost I've seen would focus on interrconnected figures. That seems  traditional approach. E.g., Socrates-Descaetes-Spinoza-Kant-Hegel-Heidegger (etc). \n\nBut, what if you spread the effort across unrelated figures?

        "text": "Bit of a long read but I appreciate whoever will take the time to read and provide some input.\n\nIt's been recently suggested to me that, assuming god exists, his omnipotence does not include the ability to do the logically impossible. and that logic is \"necessary\".\nIt's also been suggested that god is omniscient in the sense of \"knowing everything that is possible to know\". The argument was that it's \"logically impossible\" for god to know our future actions because he had given us \"true\" free will(they were arguing in favor of free will)\n\nThis immediately made me think of the contingency argument for god's existence. It tries to establish some foundation for reality, and it does so by appealing to the notion of a \"necessary being\" that could have not failed to exist and therefore is the sufficient cause or fully adequate explanation for the existence of all contingent beings (beings that if they exist, could have failed to exist). The argument then goes on to label the universe as contingent, and so a necessary being(god) must exist outside of it. In other words: there must exist a necessary being outside of all possible worlds.\n\nNow my question is: if we consider the entire universe to be contingent... does that not include logic and truth?\nThis makes sense to me because the argument is trying to reach a foundation for reality—which is defined by the laws of physics, logic, and truth—by appealing to the notion of a being that necessarily exists outside of this reality and all possible worlds(where reality, including logic and truth, would have been different).\n\nThis question of omnipotence made me think of something that might be considered to be the \"logical\" version of the Euthyphro dilemma:\n\n&gt;1) If a god exists and is omnipotent in the sense of \"being able to do everything that is possible to do\", then this seems to me to imply that the definitions of logic and possibility(and hence reality) exist independently of him. If that's true, if he's not the source of truth and logic themselves... how can he be considered the \"necessary\" being whose existence establishes a basis for reality, or the one outside of all \"possible worlds\"? Reality is defined by the laws of physics and logic and truth, if he's not the source of that, then it seems that he's a contingent being himself, and that the universe itself is the necessary being. In that case, he would just be a superior \"alien\" within this universe, not its creator. This is similar to \"if god loves what is moral, then morality independently exists\"\n\n&gt;2) if he is the source of logic and truth, then how is logic not arbitrary?\nWhat does it mean to say that logic can be arbitrary? What then do we base our epistemology on, when the fabric of reality(logic, truth, etc.) could be something entirely unimaginable if this being arbitrarily wills it? In that case, then I cannot even be making this argument, nor can anyone make any argument... logical truths would have no meaning. This last statement would also not have any meaning. At least that's how it seems to me.\nThis is also similar to \"if what is moral is defined by what he loves, then morality is arbitrary\".\n\nSo my question is: if a god cannot do the logically impossible, then in what sense is he \"omnipotent\" or \"necessary\" or \"outside of all possible worlds \" if he is not the adequate explanation or source of contingent things like logic and truth? It seems that in that case, he would be a powerful but contingent being within a necessary universe.\n\nAnd if he can do the logically impossible... how isn't everything—logic, truth, and reality—completely arbitrary? In that case, that \"necessary\" being seems to threaten the foundation of reality not establish it.\n\nAre the notions of omnipotence and omniscience incoherent? I'm not *insisting* that what I'm proposing is valid, I'm wondering. That's why I'm posting here... thoughts?",
