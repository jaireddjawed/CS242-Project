This includes questions about women's thoughts on men's words, appearances, actions, or anything else related to men. \n\nThis theme day is ENTIRELY focused on individual women and their experiences and thoughts outside of their relationships to others. This includes topics like children, motherhood, pregnancy, and friendships. Everyone is welcome to participate in Thersday regardless of your own gender, but questions should remain focused on women and their experiences and opinions. Thersdays will run from 12am ET Thursday to 12am ET Friday.\n\nExamples of things we'll remove:\n\n* What do you think of men who x?\n* How does it make you feel when men x?\n* What are your best/worst experiences with men?\n* If a man does x, how would you react?\n* Everything to do with pregnancy, parenting, children, making new friends, and any other topic that involves a woman's relationships. Those topics are very welcome any other day of the week!\n\nIf you have any questions about these supplemental rules, please message the moderators and we will be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n\\~The AskWomen Mod Team",
