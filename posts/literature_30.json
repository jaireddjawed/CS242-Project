Slothrop and the girl on the boat in her teens and then even more weirdly, Pökler and his attraction to his own daughter.\n\nEverything in the book seems to have a place or lane that it works within, but these moments in the book have confused me and I don’t really understand Pynchon’s choice to include them.

        "text": "I've posted this in some more science-y subreddits, but also wanted to see what people here thought about this. \n\nI'm not sure how many people are familiar with the concept of what is sometimes called Literary Darwinism, but the general idea is to bring the study of literature into alignment with evolutionary science, making particular use of evolutionary psychology. What these scholars would argue is that the creation and enjoyment of literature seems to be a universal human trait that must be the result of some useful adaptation, and is therefore best understood by through reference to evolutionary science rather than more familiar strategies of the humanities. In the words of Joseph Carroll, \"**Adaptationist literary scholars are convinced that through adaptationist thinking they can more adequately understand what literature is, what its functions are, and how it works, - what it represents, what causes people to produce it and consume it and why it takes the form it does**\". This often takes the form of looking at the way stories reinforce mate selection strategies and etc.\n\nAs a literary scholar, this kind of interdisciplinary thinking is really interesting to me, but I'm not without my suspicions. Some of these Darwinian critics stress that the only legitimate way to look at literature, or art in general, is through evolutionary terms, which is clearly ridiculous. But there are other concerns. Jonathan Kramnick, a professor at Rutgers, has pointed to the fact that evolutionary psychology is itself a controversial area of study: \"**According to the influential critique of Steven Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, sociobiology was merely an extreme example of a pervasive mistake within evolutionary biology itself: the parceling of an organism into discrete traits, each of which could be identified as an adaptation selected for its fitness...Selection could occur without adaptation, and adaptation without selection. There mere presence of a trait was therefore not evidence of utility, nor was utility evidence of selection\"**.\n\nI'm really curious what you think about these ideas, which can be very live, and generate a lot of name-calling and hot debate in scholars who are normally reserved. My own research is increasingly bringing me to similar intersections of science and humanities, but I really believe that this has to be a two-way street. It's not only the 'hard sciences' taking over literary studies that we need, but a place where they meet and acknowledge one another as useful disciplines. When I teach STEM students literature, something I really have to grind into them is that there is more in the world worth knowing that can fit in an excel spreadsheet - - but at the same time, we also have to acknowledge the utility of more data driven disciplines for literary work. \n\nI really appreciate any response!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/8tjd4p/discussion_of_the_old_man_and_the_sea/",
        "text": "Hi, everyone. \n\nI finished reading *The Old Man and the Sea* a couple of days ago, and I want to start a discussion on it. \n\nThis novel is so stripped down to the bare bones of narrative that it feels far more like a biblical parable, or a story out of a mythic tradition, than a piece of modern writing. Even compared to Hemingway's other works, *The Old Man and the Sea* is structurally far simpler. Just as some quick illustrations, while the character of The Old Man and The Boy do have names given in the text, they overwhelmingly referred to as just \"The Old Man\" or \"The Boy\". The lack of proper names places these characters in the realm of archetype rather than as fully fleshed out characters. Another example is the near-complete lack of interior access the reader has to The Old Man. Compared to Ishmael, who is overflowing with wit and perception that the reader is privy to, the reader is reduced surface dialogue in *The Old Man and the Sea*. \n\nAs other's have mentioned, I think *The Old Man and the Sea* is about the pain of finding a purpose to life, but situated from the vantage point of someone who has already lived a big portion of their life. It mixes the desperate need to find a satisfactory place in the world, while also lamenting the reality that time will often give you a role to play. It's up to each of us to cope with our given role in our own way. The Old Man is a fisherman, and yet at times he question whether or not this was his purpose. He was a great fisherman in his younger days, and yet he has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. \n\nI read the marlin is a physical manifestation of \"The Purpose To Life\". The Old Man comes face-to-face with what he's been truly searching for. The fish is a validation, or a confirmation, that he truly *is* a fisherman. His purpose to life is to fish, and all of his past success and failures have trained him for this encounter. This middle section of the book is perhaps my favorite because Hemingway transforms the existential psychological battle of finding a purpose to life into a physical exertion of wills between the Old Man and the Marlin. \n\nThe Old Man begins to emotionally connect to the Marlin, and his perspective on the universe is widened. If it is his purpose in life to fish, what is the Marlin's purpose in it's life? What happens when our choices lead us into conflicting purposes? In *The Old Man and the Sea*, this dilemma is stripped down to the simple battle of a man and a fish, but it evokes the battle each of us faces when interacting the world at large. Every day, we come into contact with people, all of which are trying to find their way through life. Does chaos emerge or some sort of transcendent order?\n\nEventually the Old Man kills the Marlin. It is the ultimate validation of his own existence, but it is important that such a battle has taken him far beyond the limits of where he's typically used to going. The Marlin has dragged him far out to sea and far away from his island and society at large. I think Hemingway is saying that such validation cannot come from society or external factors. The battle to find one's place in the universe is an internal battle which cannot be brought back into society. \n\nAs the Old Man tries to bring his Marlin/validation back home, sharks rip the Marlin apart bit-by-bit. I think this is symbolic of the fact that one's own internal validation will necessarily be killed and torn when brought to the surface of one's mind. If one tries to bring that validation out into the world, the world/sharks will devour it. All that's left is the skeleton, a reminder of the internal struggle.\n\nI'm curious about the Old Man's dreams about the African beach shores and the lions. It seems so odd that a man with eyes the color of the ocean would dream of land. Perhaps the Old Man is pondering the possibility of having lead a different life. His dreams contrast the reality of a man who's life is based on the sea to a life based on land. His dreams are a contemplation of what might have been mixed with a slight disappointment of having gone eighty-four days catching nothing, only to catch the largest fish he's ever seen and have it be devoured by sharks. Perhaps a life on land would have been better. Maybe he would have been a man with eyes the color of sand.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd love to hear them!\n\n",

Happy Birthday to a profoundly amazing writer. You are missed. \n\nEdit: Butler's books often deal with race, gender and genetics in strange and unexpected ways. Her work is now more prescient than ever. Her writing is simple, and straight forward, I love teaching her work because students often have no issue in understanding her writing, YET, the ideas she deals with are complex and ground-shaking. \n\nI'd be interested in hearing what others think of her work, in general. Thanks! \n\n\n\n**EDIT 2: Suggestions for reading Butler.** This is my personal order from best to least best in my humble opinion. Other people might have different opinions. \n\n1. The Xenogenesis Trilogy, republished in one volume in the year 2000 and retitled by the publisher as 'Lilith's Brood'. This trilogy is three books Dawn, Adulthood Rites and Imago. The Oankali descend on Earth after humanity has all but killed themselves on. They are here to rescue the survivors. Their price is steep, however. Issue of race, consent, and the ethics of genetics abound. This is Butler at her best. Dawn by itself is a powerhouse. \n\n2. The Patternist Series was Butler's first series of books. Chronologically, the series starts with Wild Seed, an amazing book set in the 17th and 18th centuries, the story involves the relationship between two immortals - Doro and Anyanwu. They struggle to live together over generations as Doro attempts to create a new race through a selective breeding program. Chronologically, the other books which follow show the results of Doro's experiments: Mind of My Mind, Clay's Ark, Survivor and Patternmaster.  The entire Patternist series was later republished as one volume, called Seed to Harvest. This volume excludes the book Survivor, which Butler ultimately regretted publishing and asked that it be taken out of circulation. She called it her 'Star Trek' novel. Original printings of this novel are worth about $100 bucks on ebay. \n\n3. Kindred, Arguably her most famous novel, Kindred is centered on Dana, a writer who travels back in time to meet her slave owning ancestors. Heavily influenced Ben Winters to write his book, Underground Airlines. \n\n4. Parable of Sower and Parable of the Talents. The Parable series is the darkest of her writing. This narrative is bleak and unflinching in the assessment of humanity. Not for the faint of heart. \n\n5. Bloodchild and Other Stories - A book of short stories many of which are clearly first drafts or attempts to hammer out ideas for some of her novels. The best story is Bloodchild, a story about humans \"having to pay the rent\" on an alien planet. \n\n6. Unexpected Stories, published posthumously from her papers. Not the strongest stories. \n\n7. Fledgling. Butler's take on vampires. This book was published as result of facing a bad case of writer's block while she was finishing the third, never-published book in the parable series. \n",

        "text": "This last week I read George Eliots Silas Marner,  a short novel about an outcast weaver in a small village whose greed is replaced with sincere love when his wealth is stolen and a young orphan is placed in his care.\n\nIt's a simple heartfelt story with a classic motif of turning fate, ending in a marriage and a rich benefactor.  Yet I was surprised that many critiques of the story speak very strongly of its influence as part of the realist movement in the later 19th century.  Many casting an eye on Eliot's commentary on psychological conditions, isolation, religious organizations, and even sexuality.\n\nHowever, when I read it, I found myself struck by (in my opinion) what seem to be the far stronger (or at least more overt) influences of romanticism throughout.  Silas sequester himself alone in the wilderness, and in the end Eppie follows suit, denying an upper class life, preferring her garden, on which much time is spent in particular.  There is something of a sidenote at the end of the novel in which Silas original hometown is essentially swallowed by an emerging industrial urban sprawl that at once denies Silas the comfort of external affirmation (a separate issue that Eliot deleops here that I find inslteresting) but also simply makes for a message of returning to the fundamentals (nature) is desirable, but also an endangered experience.  And finally we have some semi-Gothic fairytalesque elements, with Silas being described as a witch doctor or warlock at times. \n\nNow I realize that novels rarely fit so nicely into categorization, and will have many influences regardless of how we like to normally define a certain work.  However, I find it interesting that if this was indeed to a be a work of realism, then there is a kind of tension present with the more romantic/gothic elements.  Attempting to portray/criticize reality, yet containing characters that are mystical and a series of plot devices too optimistic and contrived to be the kind of scathing commentary that I have seen some critics make it out to be.\n\nThoughts?",
