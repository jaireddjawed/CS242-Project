I'm also not religious so no religious places.\n\nPeople told me to join University societies but they are no good either. first of all they drink more in society events than actual pubs. secondly they are just a place for people to drink and shit talk and dance at the end of it rather than do anything interesting.\n\nI still do have contact with my school friends through discord but I can't meet any of them IRL because all of us have moved to different cities ever since.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has a similar problem?\n\nWhat are the best places to meet new people IRL that no one drinks there and also not churches or anything similar?",

My other friend responds back with 'Good job' and everyone laughs. \n\nI could give many more examples, but I think you get the jist. I need help reading the person, understanding environment, removing my overly concerned and literal approach and rather just respond in a way that continues a conversation using lighthearted jokes/wit without diverging from the tone of the conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

        "text": "So this is mainly for people who want to be part of a conversation happening but don’t know anything about the subject. A lot of times I find myself in those kinds of situations. What I do is listen in to the conversation for a short while and listen to the details provided in the conversation and the emotions behind each thing. Often times it can tell you a lot about something you don’t exactly fully understand. For example let’s say you’re in a group of people who are talking about a TV show you’ve never even heard of. Listen to what they say about the characters, the plot and the events before. From this point you can either ask questions to express interest and learn more about the subject taking it from a more observant point of view.\nOr you can confidently fake knowing about the subject. This can get tricky. After learning enough about the subject confidence is key. You also would need to be right on point with expressing that you know what is being discussed even though you don’t. To continue on the  tv show example they might ask you things like “whose your favorite character?” Or “what are your thoughts on this season?” To which you could reply with “I’m not sure I think I need to see more before I form a full opinion of it.” You could also add in details from the details picked up from listening to the conversation earlier. The key is to be confident and almost repeat those details back but in a different context and sentence. If you want to try and opposing view you would need the right amount of detail to back up the opposite of what the other person thinks. For example if the described a character and labeled them as “heroic” then find qualities that could be debated as heroic and go from there. \nThere’s is a lot of grey area to find here because there are a lot of conversations to be had and they are all different this method may not work in every conversation but it works out the most for me at least \n\nThe main points to understand are \n1) listens to the details and opinions \n2)either question or fake the knowledge presented (although I recommend questioning)\n3) form your future thoughts or questions based on provided details.",

The thing is I saw them a week ago which I would say is quite recent and also message them a lot - they message me back nicely so I was quite surprised they even had a problem with me tbh.\n\nI don't know what to think, and starting to feel a bit ganged up on and like are these real friends if I get made to feel guilty for wanting to hang out with them, then a villain if I'm not? Its putting me off making effort with them, but its tricky as Friday we are all going out as a big group for someone's birthday and I don't want arguments.",

She was dancing, talking to her friends out loud, and being all around sociable to others. When I look at her doing this, immediately my mind goes to thoughts like: \"Does she knows that people are listening to her?\", \"She's making a fool out of herself\", etc.\n\nEventually I ask her if she worries about others looking at her strangely and she said this: \"I just don't care what people think. If you worry what other people think, it will take away from your experience\".\n\nI know it's easier said than done and I understand that the simple solution is just not caring, but how can I stop overthinking whether or not people are judging me negatively? At this point, almost everyone tells me to just not care, but no one explains it pragmatically, so it's a little annoying trying to figure it out by myself through trial and error.",

        "text": "I apologize for the length of this post; this is a story that's 19 years in the making.\n\nEven to this day, I still get a bit emotional about this. Not only was this embarrassing, but it also brought me shame. It was when I was in the Marines and stationed in Okinawa. Most of our time there was spent preparing for our deployment to Iraq. It was at night, and we were running these drills. As a Corporal, I was in charge of a fireteam that consisted of 3-4 other Marines. The scenario was we approached a small bridge but suddenly came under fire. How do you make it across the bridge to subdue the enemy?\n\nWell, as soon as we received \"fire,\" the best I could do was yell and tell everyone to take cover. I was worthless beyond that. We all just lay there. I could not think of a way to get anyone across that bridge. I froze. It was as if I was waiting for some instruction. We lay there for what felt like an eternity. I must have looked like an idiot.\n\nMy Gunny was pissed and called off the whole thing. \"Well, that was a f*cking abortion!\" he said. As a result, they removed me from the squad when we got to Iraq and sent me to serve as a guard at a detention facility. They told me it was because of my experience as a Security Forces Marine, but I knew they saw me as a liability. If they brought me along, I was liable to get myself or others killed. \n\nFast forward 19 years to today. As an outside salesperson, I work for an HVAC distributor, moving from customer service. I should be going out to call on customers, but I have not done that once in the nine months I've been in this position. I took this position mainly to improve my financial situation, but deep down inside; I was hoping to use it to overcome my social anxiety and advance my career. Yesterday I had my yearly review, and my Regional Manager brought up how he wants to see me go out more often and is giving me six more months to see what I do. If I don't like the position, I can return to doing what I did before.\n\nAt this moment, I realized I'd been reliving that day in Okinawa every single day for the last nine months. I know I'm supposed to be doing something, but I'm frozen. I'm stuck staring at the problem, unable to move. I have the tools but lack the confidence to use them. As always, I'm the obstacle.\n\nWhat am I missing? What's the push I need? \n\nHow can I get over this anxiety?",

        "text": "I find myself stuck in these situations where I initially enjoy some people’s company but, as we better get to know one another, they start to show their true colors. Eventually, I add it all up in my head and recognize that we have far too different maturity levels, emotional/intellectual depth, values, interests etc.\nI have empathy for others’ suffering (maybe too much at times) and I tolerate/even enjoy occasional rants, letting out negativity etc. It’s a part of life and there’s a lot to learn from tough times. However, I don’t enjoy dwelling on toxic ideas so much that they give one brain/soul rot. Some people seem to enjoy basking in dark vibes just for the sake of it. They effortlessly demean others, respond bitterly and go out of their way to hurt people around if it benefits them somehow.\nI can tell they’re trying to take our connection to the next level, but not for the best reasons - they’re doing it out of desperation / need for validation / because I have something they want etc. and so I’d like to gently, but assertively keep them at bay. This type of people are making me uneasy, because I feel they may be trying to (ab)use me and my resources (to then drop me like a hot potato). And it has happened in the past.\n\nBeing the (occasionally overly) enthusiastic person I am, wanting to see the good in others and genuinely wishing for people around me to be well can sometimes take/keep me captive in connections that I don’t want to nurture anymore. Once I can tell that the interaction doesn’t also serve me and I will neither be able to be my best self nor grow with them, I start to feel suffocated and conflicted. I usually don’t want to go straight to the nuclear route when rejecting someone, but I also need to protect my resources appropriately. I still wish them well, but I don’t want to give much of myself anymore.\n\nIn the past, I’d feel *so* bad about noticing these negative sides of people that I’d pretty much gaslight myself into thinking it must be me either misinterpreting well-meaning behavior (it was not) or having very high standards (nah, I’d rather keep them and be at peace).\n\nI think I’ve grown enough to not fear their disapproval or that they may hold a grudge by now. After all, I don’t enjoy our interactions and/or they have been disrespectful, so I remind myself to not place too much value on their opinions or live my life to please them. I’ve also made my peace with the fact that some people secretly enjoy their misery and I don’t intend to change anyone. I may be able help a little every once in a while, but *they* have to put in most of the effort to improve, out of their own willpower. I am not able/willing to be their personal coach, at my own expense.\n\nSo, what I am looking for is, ideally, specific techniques / strategies / template responses to handle this, elegantly and appropriately. There are levels and nuances to every specific situation, and I find myself at a loss for words and ideas, far too often.\nI know I still have my tendencies to be a people pleaser and I want to avoid being overly giving and close to toxic people. I’m trying to avoid tearing into anyone’s ego or sounding too stiff. … Whatever, at the end of the day, I don’t want to let people force things out of me anymore,  just to avoid potential conflict.\n\nIn the past, other people I was interested in rejected me by:\n- ghosting me\n- being rude to me\n- deceitfully stringing me along, walking the fine line between sweet flattery and care, alternated with cold, effortless detachment. I’d avoid doing this myself, unless the situation really requires it. It’s unnecessarily hurtful and wastes everyone’s time.\nAnother option is gently telling the truth, but the types of people I’m talking about are rarely wise or self-aware enough to value or respond well to something like that.\n\nWhat would you guys recommend? Any advice, personal experiences, books, links, people who talk about such topics etc. are welcome.",

When people find out I'm part time they usually ask- \"oh, do you do anything else?\" I wouldn't really mind if they asked if I had a second job, but it usually comes with the expectation that I SHOULD have a second job.

I usually don't like to tell people what I do with my time outside of work, unless we've built a comfortable relationship. \n\nYesterday when a security guard asked \"what else  do you do?\" I said \"lots of things!!\"  When he said \"oh really, like what?\" I was like \"oh a bunch of stuff... little of this...little of that\" He wanted to know specifics I guess when another security guard said jokingly \"is he trying to get at ur money?\" \"I said, yeah! Haha!\" \nHe said \"no. I'm just wondering bc if I was ur age I'd be working.... blah blah blah.\" \n\n\nAnyway...

I'm now 18 and at the age where I'm matured enough to finally change something about my life. Erm.. I'm now a college dentistry student and during the first day of meeting people I decided to take initiative to talk to people. But I can't seem to really connect. I've even watched youtube videos on how to make friends and learned things such as questioning people about themselves, telling stories, joking, asking for small stuffs, not being too negative, etc. Everyone in my class seemed to be introverted and we don't have a common interests. There's this girl who's extroverted and wanted to be friends with me, she's great.. but she has a too strong personality and I ran out of things to say to her and I sometimes caught myself most of the time awkwardly laughing. So it's only natural for both of us to find our own cirlce and it's understandable because we're not compatible. There's also this one girl whom I feel very much more comfortable to talk to, we've talked a lot of times and she already consider s me as her friend. but the problem is I don't know how to befriend her friend...

Once I graduated, I got a remote job as well as a software engineer and again I work from my home without going anywhere. Needless to say I spend the whole day in my apartment, I have no social circle. There are a lot of places to visit around me but I just don't have the habit of going alone outdoors. How do I make friends from scratch? BTW I am an introvert, with not so good social skills so that's also a factor.",

A majority of our customers are older regulars who come in everyday just to have a conversation with me. I wouldnt hang out with these people outside of work (except on the rare occasion of an orchestral concert or something) but they still make up a good portion of my social interaction.\n\nI also own a record label and am constantly networking with bands, venue directors, studio engineers, record store owners etc. sometimes its just business connections, but othertimes i will hangout with them.\n\nnone of these people have the intention of hanging out with a minor. 90% of people who meet me say they assume im 20-21. Its not their fault if they dont know im a kid. I try to tell people whenever it’s relevant, but i dont always. \n\nIts hard to socialize with people my age because im not in highschool or at any events a highschooler would ever be at. \n\nmy stance is that there shouldnt be any social barrier dependent on age. if there is any sex, drugs, or alcohol involved i am responsible enough to remove myself from the situation and thats a hard line I draw.

Sometimes I’ll notice they’ll be wearing clothes that are from my favorite tv shows or music. I wanna say hi, but to be honest im usually too intimidated because im gay and I don’t want them to think im hitting on them or interrupting their workout. Im also fairly new to the gym and I don’t know if it would be against gym culture to try and make friends there.\n\nSo I’ll usually just keep to myself wishing I had the courage to take the risk and talk to one of these guys.

I get a message from someone asking if they could draw a shirtless pic of me in jeans. The thing that gave me red flags was that none of their work was posted on their profile. I declined, but I feel like the way I said it was very rude and I should’ve gone for a simple “no” instead. Here’s the transcript:\n\nPerson: “Would you be down to get a pic drawn? A shirtless pic in jeans drawing?”\n\nMe: “Gotta be honest man, that’s a weird thing to ask a minor.”\n\nPerson: “It’s a drawing. I don’t touch nudes bro”\n\nPerson: “I always ask permission for anything. There’s creeps on twitter that take peoples pics and draw sexual things with it and that angers me.”\n\nMe: “It would be cool but I’m not comfortable with a stranger drawing me like that.”\n\nPerson: “I mean it’d be cool even if you’re the only one to see it. I’m not looking to show it off online.”\n\nMe: “No matter what your intentions are, the fact that you’re still trying to convince me is really not sending the right vibes.”\n\nPerson: “Okay. Didn’t think it would matter since you’re posting pics online but okay the nvm.”\n\nI feel like I was unnecessarily impolite but he sort of kept pressing it which made me uncomfortable. I do see his logic though. I’ve been posting pics online, what’s the difference between that and a drawing? But still, just gave me weird vibes. Especially the “creeps on twitter” part.

        "text": "Hi! Earlier this evening my roommate and I discussed housing for our sophomore year of college. She and I have been pretty good friends throughout the year so far. We spend time together, we share clothes, food, and makeup. I thought we had a really good thing going.\n\nEarlier in the year, she and I were in the same friend group. Unfortunately, that ended up falling through due to drama a little less than two months into the fall semester. Even though things were ugly at first, she and I still remained friends. Still, it was really hard on me. I was considering transferring colleges and crying at least once a day. I felt like I had no one, except for her and one other girl from the group who still stuck by my side. We weren't as close as we were before, but we were still spending time together. Eventually, things got more and more normal between the two of us and we became good friends again. \n\nAfter Winter Break, she and I came back to school and were so excited to see one another after the month off. I ended up making amends with a few people in her friend group that I was previously a member of because they finally realized the majority of the issue was a misunderstanding. After months of emotional turmoil, I was finally feeling somewhat ok. I had made a few friends outside of my old group, too (PS they already have roommate arrangements, next year:(). Things were getting better.\n\nA few weeks ago people around campus started talking about roommate arrangements for the next year. Housing deposits go down in a few days and soon after that roommate selection will begin. I kind of recognized that the possibility of she and I rooming together next year wasn't likely because her best friend at school was having issues with her current roommate. I figured the two of them would live together next year. Even though I was sad to let her go, I wasn't upset about it because one of our other mutual friends had mentioned to me that she would potentially like to live with me next year if I didn't live with my current roommate again. I kept trying to bring up the whole roommate arrangement thing to my roommate but she kept pushing it off, assuring me that I had nothing to be concerned about. Even though I was anxious and desperately just wanted to have a plan, I trusted her because I thought we were friends.\n\nThis evening when I came back from class I greeted my roommate, as usual, when I came back to our dorm. We chatted a bit about random stuff and then she looked up at me and said \"So \\_\\_\\_ (her best friend) and \\_\\_\\_ (the mutual friend who said she'd be interested in rooming with me) talked, and we decided that we're going to live in a triple next year.\" I was at a loss of words. Are you effing kidding me?! She KNEW that my only other option other than living with her was to live with our mutual friend. I totally called her out. She kept saying how she was sorry and blah blah blah. She tried to say that she was just trying to make everyone happy...but what about me? It was all BS. I said to her, \"How can you justify doing this after acting like you were my friend for all these months?\" I had literally said to her a few weeks ago that I was perfectly fine with her living with her other friend next year, but to please not triple up with our mutual friend because I'd have no one. I left the room sobbing to get some air and came back and she had left. She came back a few hours later and I had had my earbuds in. She hasn't said a word to me since the last exchange we had. We haven't even made eye contact.\n\nTo be honest, I don't even want to live with her next year anymore. I don't want to live with our mutual friend either. I don't want a pity-roommate. I just want advice on how I am supposed to handle living with someone until May who knowingly hurt me so terribly. It just sucks because I thought of her as a friend, too.",

        "text": "(20F)\n\nSo, I'm in my second year of uni and one thing that I really struggle with is maintaining new friends. I would describe myself as fairly friendly and outgoing, when it comes to meeting people at parties and such I am not awkward in the slightest. I can go up to people and chat and I've met some lovely people this way; I've also met some lovely people through societies. However, when it comes to moving the friendship up a rung I struggle a little. I've done it a few times this term, but for me, I really need the other person to initiate so I know that they like me. \n\nWhen it comes to personal or emotional things, I'll message my flatmate or my friends back home, as I don't want to make loads of people privy to my personal life. I'm quite a private person. However, when it comes to that (and when I ask my flatmate for advice), that is what people seem to do: randomly message people they don't know that well about things I would rather talk to my close friends about. \n\nI just don't really see the point or the joy in doing that. I literally just can't be bothered but I know it's the best way to go about it. I don't know, I just want to become better but I get really tired of this sort of interaction with people. I just prefer talking to people in person and I really don't get much joy out of texting, I just get tired when I see messages.",

        "text": "I've been working at my current job for about a year. When I first started working there I quickly learned an acquaintance I have known for a few years was one of the managers. We met in 2018 at a community event/ party. I vibed with him really well and loved his down to earth and gentle personality.\n\nSince then we'd keep in contact briefly through text once in a while. One day I tried reaching out to him by calling him just to check in and say hi (how friends are made I assume) and I never got a call back. I also left him a voicemail. \n\nI was a little upset about it but proceeded to move on. Through my year of working with him I felt he treated me as more of a subordinate than a younger brother (He's 10 years older than me )by making some ridiculous commands and requests. (We are also both a minority from Ghana) Because of this I felt a little bit of underlying resentments towards him. Although we occasionally have a light hearted chuckle and conversation here and there it seems fake and forced. I feel we could have been like family but he doesn't feel I'm on his level (especially agewise) \n\nMy concern is often times I come to work and don't say hi to him but eventually have to converse with him because of work related things. I have a feeling it hurts his feelings, especially because a few months ago he expressed what seemed to be his unhappiness to the fact that I don't ever say hello to him and to be honest it was kind of intentional because I wasn't really feeling him.\n\nI feel I should let go of my grieviances with him but often times he may do something that irritates and disappoints me and then I'm back to square one about how I feel about him. I'm honestly a relatively friendly person and often am quick to say hi to a friend, But since I have some disappointment and resentment towards him I just don't. I don't know if I'm missing out on a potential friendship by not being friendly enough but as the older person I feel the ball is more in his court. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "So a few years back, i worked in customer service and freaking loved it. The job was extremely easy and I spent all day meeting random people and having interesting conversations with my co-workers and customers. As a strait dude, an even nicer perk was getting all the female attention which resulted in dates, hook-ups, etc, and even a couple of relationships -Yeah, yeah, I know it's not professional, etc but tbh, idgaf. The stakes were super low and I went the first 20 or so odd years getting absolutely 0.0% attention so when it came, I went with it. \n\nWell, I've since then transitioned to a \"respectable\" corporate \"career\" that's going to set me up for the future, etc. Even though I make more than 3x what I did at my customer service job, I can't help but feel like I've given up something big in return. It's a hybrid role so I'm in the office 2 days a week. The thing is, even when I'm in the office, there's always so much work to get done and the nature of the work can be stressful - basically, it's taken a toll on how \"social\" I feel I can be with my co-workers. I just feel like I'm there to get shit done rather than make friends or even just have any meaningful conversation with people. On top of that, I don't feel like I can be myself. At my old gig, I was able to get to know many people on a deeper level and engage in some NSFW convos regarding religion/politics/philosophy, etc. which is something I love. And this doesn't even take into account the meeting women thing. This place just so happens to be overflowing with beautiful women and even though I sense interest from some, it's not as forward since the dynamics are different and honestly,  I'm terrified of initiating only to be wrong now that I'm in my \"career\" phase of life. \n\nLately, I've been strongly considering picking up another part-time customer service gig to fulfill my social needs. Many people see me and assume I have a wide social network with fully booked calendar but the truth is, I'm pretty much a loner that does fine with a lot less social interaction than most people. Unfortunately, the my old place isn't hiring otherwise I'd be back there in a heartbeat. I a concerned that managing time between the two would reduce my performance at my corporate gig, which is super busy atm. At the same time, I'm just dying to feel like myself again. I'm looking for something that's laid back, preferably only friday/saturday and maybe one other even shift during the week. I was thinking bartending might be a good option.  Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would appreciate any advice/input!",

His \"attempts\" appear unreasonable and actually make him seem less knowledgeable, so it hasn't worked. But it causes me frustration daily feeling targeted.\n\n\nAnother coworker that I get along  with (Let's call her \"Mary\") called me out in a meeting today for a mistake (which made toxic coworker guy \"A-hole\" smirked). I didn't say anything. But later Mary messaged me hoping we are on good terms and said she hoped she didnt anger me. I responded back that explaining \"I think it is pretty clear that me and A-hole don't get along\". After that quick this is our exact texts to each other:\n\n\nMe: \"Anyways, yea. Feel free to tell me if you think in overthinking or crazy. But i really appreciate you saying you didnt mean to call me out. I wont be offended if you think i say something and you tell me \"thats kinda rude\" and such. I do wonder how i am coming off too. Also sorry if I seem on edge. It's not because of you.\"\n\nMary: \"I'm so sorry you feel that way! I think we all overthink these kind of things (hence why I messaged you) lol don't worry about how you are coming off-- I think you are all good lol! Please let me know if I can help in any way!\"\n\n\n\n\nI got triggered immediately from her \"sorry you feel that way\" because I have met a lot of toxic people who were passive aggressive in the last. Which this also taught me how to never say this phrase. Judging from her total response with it though , do you think that she is genuinely saying that? I javen't gotten into full details why I feel a coworker is attacking me but now im not sure if I should open up more.",

But this will be my first time truly initiating a hang out with someone.\n\nKnow this may be silly question, but what would be some activities or places I can suggest when Initiating hang out? I’ll be catching up with them so should I just suggest a brunch? Or another activity? Haven’t spoken to them in a while, so Not sure what they are into.",

        "text": "I met this friend in september when I moved to a new city, we saw each other a few times alongside with his friends. But I realized that I don't enjoy hanging out with them, I get bored and also don't like certain views and things they say. For example they once were criticizing people who can't find a job (they dont have a job) and talked as if being a waiter is a \"degrading\" job (I work extras as a waitress to afford art supplies for school, or to save money in general). They talked in a degrading way about peopls who have less money and also addict (I am an addict trying to recover but haven't told them). He always texts me saying he wants to hang out. Most of the time I decline but I really want him to stop texting me because I don't want to see him again. How can I tell him ?",
