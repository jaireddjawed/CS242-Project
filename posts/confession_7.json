        "text": "A few years ago I used to get free Outback Steakhouse all the time. At first I would buy gift card numbers from a darknet market and exchange $150 for $600 worth of gift cards. Then after studying the Outback Steakhouse website I figured out a way to hack the site to extract good gift card numbers and their balances. I’m by no means a hacker so when I figured out how to do this I thought I struck gold! I could then use these numbers to pay for anything at the restaurant, including the tip! I knew a guy that worked there and I gave him some really fat tips a few times. Most of the time I just got it to-go and gave the employee a fat tip. While I was doing this I probably got me and my friends over $3,500+ worth of food and drinks. It was a blast while it lasted. I was even considering scheming with my Outback friend so that I tip him excessively and we split the cash but didn’t wanna push my luck. Eventually they patched that loophole by requiring a PIN for all purchases made with gift cards. Sounds like standard practice but it wasn’t for Outback at the time. Somehow I was never caught for this even though I was a dumbass and put my real information every time. I do realize that it was fraud and it was wrong because these were real gift card numbers being used by real people. I’m sure somewhere out there somebody had tried to run their gift card and it came up with a $0 balance because I already drained it. To those people: I’m truly sorry and I hope Outback replaced your gift cards!",

        "text": "I use to collect hot wheels and had many of the tracks. I specifically remember having an orange one with blue sides of the tracks and it had a motor in the middle to speed the cars up and to a 6 year old it was like magic. Anyway i remember taking pee pee down the track to see if it would go down the ramp and complete the loop, it turns out my 6 year old brain didn’t think through the entire process of this happening as my bodily fluids went down the ramp and into the motor. The motor kept running and as they where to little wheels they where slashing my juice everywhere in my room. My first thought was to run to the bathroom and soak all of the wizzle up with toilet paper so I ran to the opposite room, picked up as much rolls as I could and was headed right back to my room. I wiped and wiped for what seemed like hours to the point where all the waz had soaked into my bed, onto my walls and surprisingly on the ceiling to be honest I was kind of impressed. After I dried my room up (to the best of my ability) it absolutely rank of butterkiss popcorn and off fudge cake. So my next little mission was to grab some sort of nice smelling products to clear what only god can describe as an absolute sespit. I immediately went to my mothers room and picked up the fist perfume I could find and sprayed the absolute wham out of it in my room. I didn’t realise at the time but what I picked up was a bottle of channel which I found out to be a gift from my grandma from Philadelphia (We lived down under at the time) so we hadn’t seen her in a while. I return what was a pretty full bottle back to her room which was now pretty much empty. I thought nothing of it at the time until about 4 hours later when my mum went in her room to discover the empty bottle of perfume. It took her about 5 seconds to project her voice around the whole house which later turned into an interrogation scene between my two sisters and my brother. She slacked on me and my brother being the “suspects” as he was the eldest and I was the youngest so she ripped on the other two. Turns out I’d get off Scott free and my sisters got the blame as the pair “wouldn’t own up” I go back upstairs to my now florescent smelling room and felt like a free man. I later broke my track up and boxed it away for eternity. Which is now in my parents attic as far as I know.",

        "text": "This happened a long time ago. I was 15 and my parents recently just moved to a new city. Every once and a while I would take a bus to my old neighborhood to see my old friends. One time I was there, just hanging with my friends, chilling, playing video games, whatever. Anyways another friend (also from the old neighborhood) is texting me. She had booked a baby sitting job that night but couldn't go. She was trying to get me to go in her place but I was like what no. I don't have any experience watching kids. But she's saying please, its going to be easy. Its overnight so the kid will be asleep. She seemed desperate and I was starting to feel bad. Then she tells me I could eat stuff from the fridge. That's what convinced me to agree. I was such a dumbass.\n\nAnyways I get to the house and my friend lets me in. She's like thanks, the baby is asleep already. She dips. Now I'm in this big house. Let's mosey on over to the kitchen I say. Open the fridge. Fuck yeah pb and j time. \n\nThen I dropped the jam jar. Fuck.\n\nBaby hears the noise and starts freaking out. Shit ok.\n\nGo to kids room. See crib. Wtf I'm watching an actual baby? Is that even legal? Smell shit. Aw man did he poo? I step closer. He did. The stench is overwhelming. What the fuck do I do.  Now I'm freaking out. how do you even change a diaper.\n\nGet little fuckers diaper off. Leaks shit everywhere. Probably shouldn't have done this in the crib. Oh well too late to turn back now. The die has been cast as they say.\n\nThrow dirty diaper in garbage in room. Hope that's fine. Get fresh diaper. How the hell do I put this on? Baby kicking legs like a frog. Can't manage to get diaper on squirmy froggy bastard. Manage to kind of get it on. Looks a little fucked up. Eh good enough. Baby still crying. Probably because a stranger just changed his clothes in the night. I'd feel pretty mad too, little guy.\n\nStart freaking out. I'm in over my head here. Baby won't stop crying. What the fuck. I just put my shoes on and start running. It's like midnight and I'm just straight up sprinting down the street. I made it a block and then called a cab. I just rode the cab and told him I only had 20 bucks so to just take me as far as he could. He seemed kind of weirded out but was just like ok.\n\nThe meter hit $20 so I asked him to stop and he was saying it's ok he can just drive me home. I ain't no freeloader, I say. I pay my way in this world.\n\nI walk until I find a bus stop. I get home and just go to bed.\n\nWoke up to like 50 angry voicemails on my cell from my friend. I just blocked her number. Im hoping she doesnt somehow have my new house number. Summer holidays were almost over at that point and i started school and met new friends. I just never went back to my old neighborhood and never told anyone. Social media was in its infancy at the time too so they couldn't track me down that way.",
