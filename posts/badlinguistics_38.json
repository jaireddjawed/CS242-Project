        "text": "[This](http://muyueh.com/greenhoney/) site was posted to /r/InternetIsBeautiful today and the thread got lots of comments. Most of them were fairly good about how this doesn't tell us anything about how we perceive colors, just about how we name them. This particular comment was both very long and almost entirely incorrect. \n\n[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/2n9kyy/english_perception_of_color_vs_chinese_perception/cmc4lh9) long comment starts off with some wrong assumptions:\n\n&gt;In short with English you have descriptors like \"Tuscan brown\", or \"Spanish Blue\", or \"pastel\" and \"web\".\n\n&gt;This is almost entirely and totally a result of English being a Germanic language that has inherited the bulk of it's word from French. \n\nNo, English did not inherit the bulk of it's words from French. And no, the esoteric and specific names for colors isn't a result of English being oh so special. It's simply paint manufacturers and sellers wanting to have a more enticing name for Tuscan Brown than #dda180 on the RGB chart.\n\n\n&gt;French itself is not the relevant point, but the idea that English is a living language that consists of words which largely originated from other languages (in this case Latin) is what you need to take away from this.\n\nBecause of course no other languages do this? And again the idea that English language comes primarily from other languages (and I thought it was French that English borrowed from, not Latin?) \n\n&gt;Anyway so East Asian languages aren't like that. I'll use Korean as an example because I'm most familiar with Hangul although it applies to Chinese. \n\nSo Korean is part of the Altaic family of languages and Chinese (and which variety of Chinese is this supposed to refer to anyway?) is part of the Sino-Tibetan family, yet this principal applies to both of them?\n\n&gt;In any kind of descriptive categorization like colors, distances, approximations, etc., you will find similarities that are kind of obvious (ocean blue, eg), but when you get into the minutiae of things they have a tendency to just start lumping in things. \n\nGiven how much this person has talked about their difficulties in communicating while in Korea (doesn't even know the word for monkey-wrench), I'm going to have to go ahead and say that it's not that Korean doesn't have these specific sorts of names for colors, it's that this person doesn't know them. \n\nAlso English is perfectly capable of \"lumping\" things together as well, and in fact if you don't know the names of the various colors you'd probably call them brown, dark brown, light brown, tan, etc. Even though those colors can encompass a huge variety of shades of color. \n\n&gt;These languages feel much more formal and characters can have multiple meanings. Where in English we have words that are spelled the same and mean different things, or even have things that sound the same and are spelled differently, in East Asian languages they can have a single character that carries several dozen meanings depending on context.\n\nLots more generalizations here. And again with lumping all East Asian languaes together. \n\n&gt;What of the interesting things that was brought up in this presentation was the question whether these naming conventions were more efficient than one another. The point was made that, \"English is more robust\", but then it was questioned whether the Chinese method was a better organization. It's an interesting theoretical question but the alternate is the French system where there is a 1984-esque committee of language.\n\nOh look, the French have a committee nonsense! And what the hell does it mean that \"English is more robust\"? More robust than what? Chinese isn't in any danger of dying out--seems plenty robust to me.\n\n&gt;It's really interesting how language affects the way we think\n\nSapir-Whorf!\n\n\n&gt;So you have to get creative. It's hard in retrospect to think of specific examples, \n\nYou can't think of any examples? You don't say . . .\n\n&gt;but if they bring you a wrench and you want a monkey wrench you might look up the word monkey, or act like a monkey... \n\nReally? Or you could draw a picture of a wrench? Or point to it on the shelves? Why do you need to act like a monkey, especially if you're speaking a foreign language where the specific tool is likely *not* going to be called a monkey wrench?\n\n",

They have grammar, too. The idea that they are primitive and speak in grunts is really rather racist.\n\n(Some of you may remember another IRC post I made, where a guy argued that colonialism wasn't so bad. He thought the problem was that the west allowed the poor natives to rule themselves too soon. Yes, this is the same guy. He has also seriously used the word \"towelhead\" in conversation. Any of you surprised if I tell you he's an engineer?)",

        "text": "Greetings one and all,\n\nOne of our honoured members, /u/shannondoah , recently submitted a link which caused much amusement and chortling. In the offending link a man claimed that Sanskrit was essential for computational literacy. \n\nBut something caught my eye. \"Computor\". What on Earth is that? we took it to mean \"computer\", an unfortunate misspelling, but how can that be? Are we really to believe that a grown adult could be so unintelligent, so ignorant, so pigheaded, to assume that Sanskrit was vital for computing? No, no....perish the thought. So instead I took off my ~~gimp~~ chef's hat and put on my philological one.\n\nIn modern Greek M+P together are used to write the voiced labial we use \"B\" for and I suspect this sensible combination may be used elsewhere. Perhaps the good Swami was trying to tell us something but was unable to do so, English being his second language. So \"computor\" should perhaps be voiced as /cobutor/. So Sanskrit is important for cobutor literacy?\n\nThe clue, gentlemen, was in the first element of the sentence. What in Sanskrit could possibly give us cobutor? कपोत !! or /kapota/ !! it is a close match and means pigeon. I had thought this might be too far fetched, perhaps like many Sanskrit activists he knows no Sanskrit? but then I remembered that in Hindi the word for pigeon (perhaps borrowed from Persian) is कबूतर or /kabutr/ which sounds, frankly, even closer!\n\nThe only logical explanation, then, is that the good Swami intends to use Sanskrit to teach pigeons to write. After all what other solution is left? that a grown man thinks we need it for computer studies? Not likely friends, not likely.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Common_Pigeon_Portrait.jpg\n\nको को को !\n\nPIGEON. Damnit. PIGEON. ",
