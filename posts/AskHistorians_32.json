However, Russia was already going down a death spiral due to institutionalized fragility and poor economic planning. The KGB recognized more than anyone how politically and economically unsustainable the communist policies of the USSR were, because it was their job to analyze the state of the USSR and foreign countries. Brezhnev's commitment to an arms race USSR couldn't pay for, and his control of satellite nations the USSR couldn't manage, created a situation which Gorbachev could not manage because it was largely out of the USSR's ability to do so. \n\nYet, no doubt many singularly blame him for the fall of the USSR, blaming Glasnost and Perestroika among other policies for giving satellite nations state actors the ability to break off and do their own thing. This is a summation of what Kissinger explained.\n\nGorbachev was no doubt bold in his attempts at reform, and no doubt since his innovative early days significantly growing output of crops in his homeland of Stavropol, he was known as a reformer. As he rose up the ranks, I imagine his reformist thinking upset many people. I wonder, how did they ever elevate him into the role of General Secretary?",

        "text": "I was reading about Jacques cinc-Mars, an archeologist who made a discovery at the blue fish caves and was ridiculed amongst academia and other historians and archeologists. The reason being is it went against mainstream archeology at the time. Until recently it was accepted that the Clovis people were the first people to populate the Americas. But Jacques’s discovery predates the Clovis people by thousands of years. He discovered it in the 90s and was routinely ridiculed and laughed at. However, decades later the narrative has changed and Clovis first has been debunked and people agree that jacques was correct. Some excerpts from an article: \n\n“Clovis first will, I believe, go down as a classic example of a paradigm shift, in which the evidence for the collapse of an old model is present for many years before it actually collapses, producing a sort of zombie model that won’t die.”\n\n“Dillehay and his colleagues had meticulously dated the oldest human activity at the site to 14,500 years ago. But for years, most North American researchers refused to accept the date.”\n\n“Tom Dillehay remembers such conferences well. “Some Clovis first people had a suffocating air of defiance and superiority at times,” he says.”\n\nhttps://hakaimagazine.com/features/vilified-vindicated-story-jacques-cinq-mars/\n\n\nSo my question is why did it take so long for academics to accept that Clovis first theory was wrong ? Are there any current analogous situations where the evidence is clearly against a mainstream theory and academia is reluctant to admit it?",

How credible is this explanation? If you were bit by a flea, was the pathogen so devastating a healthy immune system would have made no difference?\n\n\\*If a pathogen is introduced by bites from fleas or animals, does this make a pathogen more dangerous due to how bites make a pathogen enter the body? Does this explain why diseases such as Ebola and Rabies are so deadly?",

They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.\n\n\"German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland\" refers to Germans living within the 1937 boundaries of Poland up to the Curzon line going East. In theory, that German ethnic population could have been expelled to the Polish temporarily administered territories of Silesia, Farther Pomerania, East Prussia and eastern Brandenburg.\n\nBecause the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany were under great strain, the Czechoslovak government, the Polish provisional government and the control council in Hungary were asked to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out having regard to the present situation in Germany and suspend further expulsions until these estimates were integrated into plans for an equitable distribution of these \"removed\" Germans among the several zones of occupation.¨\n\nSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam\\_Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Agreement)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe definition for ethnic cleansing the UN uses is:\n\nAs ethnic cleansing has not been recognized as an independent crime under international law, there is no precise definition of this concept or the exact acts to be qualified as ethnic cleansing.

Darwin later said that their \"No\" meant jack shit in the face of their master which started the arguement.\n\nIt was during this time Darwin was making observations which began to challlenge his creationist views and replaced them with theories of evolution. These views applied to humans, but did the existence of slavery ever cross with his theories. \n\nDid he consider enslaved people robbed of their \"Chance\" to prove their geentic fitness? Did he grow to believe being slaves meant they were unfit from the jump? Any variation of these thoughts? Any blatant racism?\n\nIf not slavery, has class inequality ever conjure similar thoughts?",

World War II German super-heavy siege guns pg. 13 it states “The gun was later officially named ‘Dora-Gerät’, or simply ‘Dora’ after a nickname given by its crew. The second gun, ‘schwerer Gustav’, or just ‘Gustav’, was completed in 1943. (G. Heuer)”. This is also supported by Zaloga, S. and Dennis, P. (2016). Railway guns of World War II pg.14 which states “The first gun was named “Dora,” reputedly after the wife of Erich Müller, the head of the Krupp gun design bureau. The second gun, completed in August 1942, was dubbed “schwerer Gustav 2” (Heavy Gustav) after the head of the Krupp firm.”. On the German wiki page it claims that 2 guns were built, but I haven't been able to access any of the German references.  \n\n\nHowever, in Batchelor, J.H. and Hogg, I.V. (1973). Rail Gun. pg. 56 it states “For some years after the war it was believed that two of these weapons had been built, named Gustav and Dora. However, subsequent research has shown that only one Gustav was made:“. In addition to this in many other sources I've read they simply refer to “The Gustav” or “The Dora” Implying only one such weapon existed, such as in Engelmann, J. (1976). German Railroad Guns in Action. Pg. 35. “the 80 cm(E) \"Dora\" (later called \"Schwerer Gustav\"--\"Heavy Gustav\"-from 22 June 1942).”\n\n  \nCan anyone point me in the direction of any definitive sources on this topic?",

        "text": "When a higher up, say head of state, 4-5 star general/admiral or minister of importance chose to fly from A to B, would there be some sort of extra precautions that were already becoming standard of were they always ad hoc? Did head of state for example have a certain plane/pilots ready or were they always arranged on the spot.\n\nThe aviation safety was a huge issue during the early years of airplane and during WW2 many generals(2 lt Generals, 6 major generals of US Army) and other ppl of importance fell to their deaths because \"lack of it\". Some people were thought to be so important they shouldn't fly at all(e.g. some personnel related to atomic bomb) and some were heavily discouraged for doing so(people with secrets and other importance). But what other safety measures there were other than \"no fly\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mainly interested in western Allies, but if anyone has something about Russians/Germans /Japanese/Italians, feel free to answer.",
