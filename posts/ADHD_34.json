        "text": "26yo recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD. I’ve lived my entire life with extreme time blindness, chronically late to school and work about 50% of the time. Can’t stick to schedules well and perception of time and how long tasks take to complete is non existent. I have heaps of goals and I know how to achieve them but actioning them is an incredibly slow and painful process, if it even happens at all.\n\nMy next appointment is to discuss medication options which I’m really excited for, but I want to know what to expect before getting into it. At the moment I have this idea in my head that it’s going to fix all my issues and make me a working powerhouse but I know that’s probably not exactly how it’s going to go.\n\nSo what should I expect? Will it eradicate my time blindness or will it still be harder to manage than a neurotypical person? What steps will I have to take to ensure I’m not relying on medication and am using it as an aid and not a be all end all, and also taking advantage of it to the fullest extent? Honestly I’m just sick of living like this, every day feels harder than the last and I’m worried it’s always going to be tough even with medication. Any insight is really appreciated.",

        "text": "I want to share this moment of joy, because I'm hoping you'll 'get it', in ways that a lot of people just won't. \n\nI've had problems with eating most of my life. (I can't remember when it started, but it was definitely 'at school').\n\nI've been a 'snacker' - compulsively munching my way through the day, especially at work. Even when I wasn't hungry. I just couldn't really stop. \n\nAnd I had no idea that could be connected to ADHD, but it seems to have just evaporated on starting medication, so ... I'm assuming it was. Apparently there's some science behind 'sugar stimulus', but also maybe eating was my 'fidgeting' as well - doing something with my hands whilst I did other stuff. \n\nEither way, it was unhealthy, and a thing I've really struggled with.\n\nSo for the longest time? I just wouldn't start eating something I wasn't prepared to finish. I just can't have chocolate bars in the house, because I'll scoff them. I can _slightly_ resist unopened ones a bit better, but if it's open? It's gone. \n\nAnd so, the other day, for the first time in my life, I ate _half_  a chocolate bar, and put the rest down for tomorrow. \n\nAnd I almost cried. Because I've never been able to do that.",

Skipping over many details the overall consensus was that I started out very strong but have not been consistent in the past few months. I work in social services and the job is stressful. I’ve had serious emotional problems in the past few months. I have gone back to therapy weekly and am looking to go back on medication. I was on medication for bipolar 1 but I’m realizing I don’t think that diagnosis is accurate for me anymore. I feel like my evaluation, if it was read in full, would be a clear indicator for problems w/ ADHD (and maybe autism but that’s another convo).\n\nI need some tips on a couple things:\n\n1) What tips can be helped for work? I have really bad organizational skills and have trouble following deadlines that are massively important.\n\n2) How can I approach this topic of reframing my diagnosis w/ my therapist? I’m also seeing a Pysch NP for a consult and would like to bring this up with them as well.\n\nThank you in advance!!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11ls5ry/are_there_any_meds_that_feel_like_vyvanse_but_are/",
        "text": "tl;dr at bottom\n\nI’m currently on Vyvanse 40mg and dextroamphetamine 10mg, and Vyvanse is an absolute lifesaver. I take it in the mornings around 8 am and it lasts me until about 2:30-3 pm. Dextroamphetamine is supposed to be the booster so I can still do stuff the rest of the day, but I really dislike how it feels. \nWith Vyvanse, I gain the ability to focus on tasks and choose what I want to do, but with dextroamphetamine, I can focus really well but I have no control over what I focus on. This makes it really easy for me to get completely engrossed in some random thing and waste the whole afternoon and evening on it. The only way I can avoid this is by making sure I start doing the target task before the dextroamphetamine kicks in, which is kind of difficult to do every day. \n\nAnother problem that I have with dex that I don’t have with Vyvanse is getting some weird side effects. It’s hard to describe it but sometimes when I’m on dex I get an urgent feeling that I need to do something and if I avoid doing it, I start feeling anxious and then panicked very quickly. The “something” is almost always one of three things: erasing and rewriting/redrawing something I wrote in pencil ((doesn’t happen with pen) repeated as many times as it takes for the anxious feeling to become manageable), wiping my pencil (again, never pen) tip on something because it feels itchy (I legitimately don’t know how to describe it better than that), or scratching my hand, which is something I do when I’m anxious.\n\nI can also get really, really irrationally angry when I get interrupted or even when I hear any of my family members make noise. It can get up to “very strong urge to scream or hurt someone” levels of angry. I wear earplugs when I’m in that kind of mood, but sometimes sounds still make it through, which can ruin a productive work period. I used to take Adderall in the afternoon instead of dex and all this happens on both dex and Adderall. These side effects don’t sound too bad but I’ve wasted hours in one afternoon by constantly “fixing” pencil work that should’ve been done in 30 minutes.\n\nEven though this all sucks, I can’t afford to stop taking meds in the afternoon or spend weeks switching to a new medication only for it to have the same issues. I’d only be willing to try switching afternoon meds if anyone knows of any short-acting medications similar to Vyvanse, because I have gotten zero side effects from Vyvanse and I would sell my soul to have Vyvanse levels of directable focus for the whole day. For the record, I’ve also been on methylphenidate (Ritalin generic) and guanfacine (Tenex generic) and they did nothing or worse. \n\ntl;dr: I’m on Vyvanse plus dextroamphetamine in the afternoon, but my experience &amp; side effects with dextroamphetamine haven’t been great so I want to know if there are any short acting medications that feel similar to Vyvanse that I could take instead. I’ve already tried Adderall, Ritalin, and Tenex to varying degrees of disappointment.",

I wanted to post on here to get advice or help with a problem I’m having at work that might be connected to my ADHD. I have been having a problem with writing treatment notes with my patient treatments. I was getting vague feedback for a while and was getting frustrated with lack of clear examples or guidelines regarding my notes. I just finally got the specific feedback I was asking for, and it sounds like I’m struggling with attention to detail. Problem is that I usually like to write my notes when the Dr is talking, but when there are changes to the treatment I often find myself having to reorganize my thoughts the note and plan treatment all at the same time. So if I don’t get to edit it accurately or lack the time to do so, I write myself a sticky note to go back. Problem is that I’m also forgetful and my sticky notes are not completely accurate or detailed enough for me to edit them properly. I’m at a point where I feel defeated. I’m taking ADHD meds to help with mental focus and clarity, and I feel like I’m doing the best to my knowledge. Are there any medical workers or dental hygienist with ADHD able to provide advice or inspiration? I really love what I do and a career change is something I don’t want to do.",

He specifically mentioned and was talking about caffeine. \nI am an iced coffee/iced latte fiend, and I often drink it in a self medicating manner as well as for personal comfort and general enjoyment. Most of the time I have at least a small glass just to ward off the withdrawal that sets in mid-afternoon to evening.\n\nI guess my question is; how do people go managing the caffeine withdrawal process when moving onto medication? What have been peoples’s experiences swapping self medication for actual medication? Or do people just do both?\nIs there a chance I am going to like iced coffee less when I’m medicated?\nIs the withdrawal just as much of a bitch as it would be normally or is there any way it can be managed?\nI think I would really miss my morning iced coffee.

I can't afford any form of treatment and I'm worried ADHD will stop me from working too. Watching my peers get accepted for prestigious colleges, huge scholarships, with their awesome skills and impressive hobbies has brought me down so much. I'm worried it's too late for me, that the treatment I need probably won't work, and even if it did, it's too late.

        "text": "This is a long story but I really just wanted to share this as a warning to others but also just get it off my chest. My brother was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and has been on some kind of medication since. He was also diagnosed with depression as a teenager. We would get in horrendous fights that, looking back, we're not normal sibling stuff. He was very physically abusive. At one point he actually threatened me with my parent's gun when we were home alone and I had said I was going to call my mom. But you know, we were just kids. \n\nHe would also just go into terrible fits of rage. He'd throw tantrums that would last hours that scared my mom into backing down. Doctors told us that was just what ADHD does. He's now 27 and still lives at home, I'm 25 and moved out years ago. But over the last few months I've gotten an increasing number of calls from my mom where she expressed concern over how many fights they were having. He started college 8 months ago and was doing decently. Than, he got out on Adderall 6 months in. This is where the fights started. \n\nAdderall was AMAZING for him at first. Straight A's, making friends,  etc. But the dosage was increasing. He went to 30mg fast. Fights got more violent. Strange men came into the house consistently when my brother was not openly gay nor ever sexually active earlier. No matter how much my mom asked him to stop he never did. He bagam buying INCREDIBLY amounts of things without asking my mom, eventually almost ruining her credit and forcing her to set a boundary where he had to use his financial aid.\n\nHe bought over $10,000 worth of Mary jane, liquor, sex toys, and clothes in 6 months, with a mysterious money source. Not to mention random things he might use once or twice like Lego sets, a piano, a switch, playstation, psychology books, furniture, hair growth products. He firmly expressed he would never be interested in tinder or tattoos but now he was always on there and was getting a neck tattoo. \n\nWe have a old cat who will bite at your feet if you walk too close to her. When she did this, he kicked her. She's okay, we took her to the vet and she's had a full recovery after a minor limb. We did not know at the time that he had kicked her and thought she was just old. But he stopped liking the cat completely and always complained about her after years of that cat being his baby. \n\nMy mom called me and I ended up having to come home because I got so bad that she was forced to kick him out. The abuse had grown. He was lying about where he was staying. He was driving the car so recklessly that I had to take it away and neighbors commented. He wrote entire manifestos and spoke things that made zero sense.  He had littered his entire room with psychology quotes. To make a long story short he really went off deep end. \n\n Adderall absolutely ruined his life.\nOr to be more precise, a misdiagnosis of extreme ADHD when he really had bipolar disorder for 17 years ruined his life. We also think that other drugs could have been involved but do not know. \nPlease make sure you or your loved do not have bipolar disorder before taking Adderall and if you do have it, please think about other medications if you have a comobility with ADHD. The damage is done in this stories absolutely heartbreaking. I feel guilt, but I also I'm accepting that right now I'm struggling with empathy though I know he's suffering. I hope he can get the help he needs but I am so sad he did not get it sooner.",

        "text": "So, I'm in my early 20s. I'm about to enter my mid 20s very soon, and the thought of this scares me.   \nAll my life, I've known something was a little off with me. Little quriks and odd proclivities that I didn't notice in other people. Different ways I was socialized, and different ways of parenting I saw that would work on me that didn't other people, and vise versa. It never really occurred to me that I had ADHD, which is hilarious. I figured, \"Well, I'd know, wouldn't I?\" Apparently not, lol. Nor did my mental health professionals even consider this at the time - because I masked it very well in public, or at least I did very much so when I was a teenager. When I got home, I'd literally be a whole different person down to every last single mannerism, and holding it in all day exhausted me, and then a little cookie-cutter version of myself cut into the image of those around me for the best social outcomes.   \nBut, in the quest to find out what exactly was wrong with me - to find out why I was so unmotivated, to find out why I had such a hard time keeping jobs, to find out why I was so emotionally dysregulated, to find out why I'm overemotional in general, to find out why I am the way I am, what makes me tick, I searched far and wide. I searched for autism, personality disorders, etc - but when I stumbled upon ADHD, everything really did all start to click together in a way that excited me. For the first time in my life, I had answers to questions I didn't even know I had about myself.   \nI thought this would be a grand realization for my family... They didn't care at all, unfortunately. It was only a grand revelation for me.. my own personal little achievement only I could see and feel a difference with. I was willing to sit with this for a time.   \nSince my evaluation, I've been sitting here thinking to myself:   \n\"So, what about college?\"   \nThe alarming thought with this is that it's been six fuckin' years since graduation. Six years. I'm still the same guy - a horrible procrastinator, a perfectionist without the energy to put in the effort in order to receive the satisfaction from perfection, so I just suffer with myself through these thoughts and feelings - I don't take action to better my future, I just get up every day, play the same games, tell myself the same story about where I'm going, what happened to my 'bright future' my teachers in school thought I'd have, and navigate the world like a blind bat using its echolocation as a last-resort way to see - both socially and with adulthood skills. I have no fuckin' idea what I'm doing, what I want, where I'm headed, and I only feel panic as I settle into this next step into adulthood, a new age of me not doing anything, not knowing what's going on, barely knowing who I am, and feeling utterly incapable of ever hoping to catch up to my peers who outclass me in nearly every metric. I'm just a burnt out, white-dwarf star. I feel like a giant anchor on everyone in my life and to myself. I used to find the kinks in my personality to be sort of endearing, to both myself and others, but I'm starting to realize what a professional horseshitter I am to myself. I wake up in the morning, lie to myself. Eat lunch, lie to myself. Work, lying to myself. Play games, lying to myself. Browse reddit, lying to myself. Muse on these things - lying to myself. I like to think that I'm an honest guy, but when it comes the things I've told myself, absolutely not. The lie is that I'll get better one day, that I'll rise above this somehow, that I can do it.   \n\n\nI don't know if I can do it, I don't know if I can change, and I don't really see a path forward that feels possible, makes sense for my life.. I'm functionally disabled by my condition. I genuinely cannot do boring jobs, or I face burnout and become unemployed. I genuinely feel like I cannot do activities I don't want to do for very long, which really can destroy my social life. I genuinely feel like I let my partner down all the time with my inability to properly communicate and properly show my feelings - from the way I phrase things to the ways I show that I care.   \n\n\nYou know, they always tell you, \"You're enough.\"   \n\n\nBut, what if I'm not enough. What if other people are capable of being enough, but I'm quite obviously showing to both myself and everyone that knows me that I'm just fucking not.   \n\n\nThese past two years, I've only gotten worse with these symptoms, and it's brutal on my spirit and my psyche. The shame that I feel that my partner couldn't have met me when my brain was firing on all cylinders when I was a teenager just plagues me to my core. I feel like a broken-down car on the side of a road that people occasionally stop by and help either by pity or out of genuine curiosity to see if they can get it to run again - a personal project they're taking on or something.   \n\n\nI just have no idea how to think or feel anymore. I don't think I can change, and my opinion of myself is really reaching an all-time low and I have no idea if it can even be fixed due to the amount of times I've let myself down. I can't trust myself to do anything different than what I've been doing because every time I try to change, I get bored and fall back down into the same rut.   \n\n\nIf you've read to the end, thank you, I appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hello, I'm a 19 yr old college student (f). If it matters, I recently got diagnosed officially after years of speculating that I have ADHD. After finally getting to the root of the problem, my PCP started me on 36mgs of concerta. For some context, I'm 4'11 and 108 lbs. A little lady, if you will. Concerta is currently working fucking wonders in terms of shutting my brain off and helping me focus a bit. The only areas in which I'm currently lacking are forming sentences without stuttering or pausing and catching my thoughts directly after I lose them. However, other than that, Concerta is amazing. But of course, I live in AR, which, there is a huge shortage in almost every ADHD medication except for Vyvanse. \n\nI got put on Concerta because I took a genesight test and found that it was my best match, Vyvanse on the other hand, was uncategorized. My pharmacist literally gave me the last five pills he had and said, \"This is all I got kid, call me after five days, and we'll get your Vyvanse going.\" Honestly? I'm very nervous. \n\nWe're starting me off on 20mgs, and I've already read articles that Vyvanse is stronger. I guess what I'm asking is, is this a bad idea? Am I in over my head? I would stay on Concerta because I've never felt better, but I don't want to go without it and have to be overstimulated by my own brain and be angry/upset all the time. Do I have any valid reason to worry? \n\n\nTLDR: Switching from Concerta (36mg) to Vyvanse (20mgs) due to Concerta shortage, but Concerta works fine. Should I worry?",

The last one is the only one that had benefit and no significant side effects until a few months into taking half the recommended starting dose (2.5mg).\n\nThen I was hit with what I suppose could be described as a crash or a withdrawal, where each evening I would enter horrible depressive disassociate episodes that were extremely hard to tolerate and if I were not in a supportive environment I would've endangered myself. After stopping the drug completely I was in that state constantly for the following two weeks  \n\nI thought it was a coincidence the first time it happened. I tried dexies again after being sometime on SSRIs to counteract the fatigue but the same thing occurred except much sooner into treatment. Recovery was also quicker. \n\nI've spoken to my psych about this and aside from calling it a crash he has no idea what's going on. We just decided to abandon stimulants all together which I support.\n\nHowever I'm still puzzled by my reaction and I wonder what it says about my pathology. Maybe I don't have adhd? Maybe my brain is super cooked. Perhaps my dopamine metabolism is overly active and reactive I truly did have profound dopamine withdrawal from 2.5mg daily. \n\nDoes anyone have more information on this? \n\nThe specific expression of my crashes being self destructive might have something to do with my borderline traits.",

Lately, we’ve had a specific email about stimulant shortages. I appreciate these emails as a parent of a Concerta taker. I got an updated email today stating these following things. Mind you this was info specific to the wholesaler we use so I don’t know if it’s the same everywhere. I’m in the Northwest region of the US. \n\nThe following are projected shortage recovery dates per various manufacturers. \n\nAdderall IR &amp; ER 3/17-4/21\nGeneric concerta 18, 27, 36mg 3/24-3/31 \n\nI’m curious to know which manufacturer they’re expecting stock from for generic concerta because last I heard the only true generic concerta was made by patriot pharmaceuticals which is an offshoot of Janssen pharmaceuticals and Janssen announced they would no longer be making it?? I don’t know if this is still true or not. My health system pharmacy has had other generic methylphenidate preparations in stock that they state are an acceptable substitute but cannot be called generic concerta because of technicalities with arguable significance. Anyway, does this jive with anything you’re hearing about? I wish there was some transparency in all this. It sucks to have to piece it all together. \n\nOne other thing, our insurance wasn’t covering brand name concerta though it was regularly in stock. I submitted a request to cover form to my pharmacy benefits manager, my prescriber filled it out for me. And I got an approval letter yesterday. They covered brand name concerta at generic rates. And the authorization I have goes through April 24th, after that I have to request authorization again. But if they are truly able to recover the shortage of generic concerta by end of March this may be a non-issue for us. Either way, I picked up 30 shiny brand name Concertas for $4 this morning and I about shit my pants. I don’t mean to provide false hope listing those dates above, I just have this information that is at least specific to where I am and wanted to share. I hope it’s true and that production issues are truly being resolved.",

My brain also makes me think I know what other people are thinking (I obviously don't) and makes up crazy scenarios that will never happen until I make myself sick. \nHow do I stop this? Or prevent it from happening literally everytime I meet someone even remotely nice? \nI know part of it a traumatic up bringing and parental guidance that \"guys only want to talk to you for one reason\" or bullshit along those lines. So my brain is flattered and gets dopamine from that thought? Idk.",

Besides the school struggles, mostly with difficulty getting started on tasks, the most significant challenge is managing his emotions. \n\nHis anger can escalate quickly and he can become violent. The violence has subsided a bit as he’s gotten a bit older but he will sometimes still kick or hit if he’s over the top angry.\n\nHe is extremely argumentative and can be inflexible with his thinking.\n\nHe is un medicated because he refuses meds. We’ve tried everything, in addition to having him chat with a nurse, a social worker, a psychiatrist etc…\n\nThe last time we tried meds was 2.5 years ago. He refused and we dropped it because his behaviour had gotten much better. He’s now entering puberty and hormones are exacerbating any negative moods he’s already feeling.\n\nWe went to the Dr. today and I picked up a new RX and I’m going to try to get him to take meds again.\n\nMy biggest concern is that he will always have these huge outbursts and will never be able to self regulate enough to live an independent life. I just can’t see him working or being in a relationship, because he has a few outbursts per day. Some are small and some are more intense.\n\nHas anyone struggled with self regulation as a child/teen, and improved or found ways to manage as an adult?",

I lost a couple pounds but that doesn't bother me bc I have a bad history of over eating and binging I've been trying to handle for years.\n\nI thought maybe I was starting to feel the positive effects of it- I felt less irritable, going to run errands and get groceries didn't feel like a big deal, but now I'm having a day where I've been super bored and nothing is interesting at all. I've been boredom eating again, and I'm craving sugar bc im probably starved of dopamine. \n\nI know that Strattera can take 4-6 weeks to become effective and it technically hasn't been a full 4 weeks of being on it yet. Maybe I mistook having a couple good days for the medication becoming effective? I'm frustrated. I've got a couple art commissions that I just CAN NOT seem to bring myself to do and I am so anxious and foggy, I just want this to work! Otherwise I have to tell my psychiatrist to try me on something else and the process is just annoying. \n\nPlease, can anyone else share their experiences?",

However, the mistakes I’m making are being made over and over again. The job I do requires quite a bit of energy, I’m an ‘Optical Assistant’ and work basically as a receptionist/retailer and have to memorize prices, prescriptions and schemes we do for customers etc. \n\nWell, I’ve noticed that when my manager or my supervisor is talking to me that I basically zone out. I don’t even realize I’m zoning out until I stop and remember to keep my focus on what they’re saying. I just cannot for the life of me keep my focus on what they’re saying when they’re explaining something. Even understanding what they’re explaining is quite difficult. \n\nNot only that, when I choose to do a task I think I am fully capable of doing I somehow miss a few steps or just completely mess it up. It’s incredibly grating on my perception of myself and my capability. All these mistakes are slowly wearing on my confidence. I’m not soaking in information I’m supposed to be learning at a normal rate and i don’t know how to fix that. \n\nI’m also not the best at getting my thoughts across, it requires a lot of energy for me to build a sentence in my head that is coherent and to the point (which is very rare, honestly). \n\nMy mother works with mental health and she says I do need to bring the possibility of ADHD up with my GP but part of me doesn’t think I have it and that I’m just simply dumb and not cut out working that role. Does this sound familiar to any of you? I know we all suffer with ‘ADHD’ symptoms but it’s the severity of these symptoms that matter.",

He's since been diagnosed and put on a lot of medication. \n\nHanging out with him just isn't fun and is emotionally draining but I feel bad because I don't want to stop seeing someone because of a condition outside of their control. That being said, I think he is a bit of a hypochondriac and possibly over medicated. He's on Lithium, Lituda, 30 mg Aderal XR, Xanax, Lunesta, and a few others I can't remember. Whenever he feels tired he takes more aderal and when he feels too energized he takes Lunesta.\n\nHe goes to the doctor for every little thing. The other day he went to the ER because of diarrhea. He's lactose intolerant but makes it seem like any amount of dairy will kill him when I know for a fact this is not true because he eats dairy at home all the time. Going to restaurants is such a chore because he turns into such a karen when it comes to telling the waiter about dairy. \n\nWhen I'm with him it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall and carrying the conversation on my shoulders. He's generally irritable, gives one word answers, or just sits there quietly without participating. I know that he's prescribed to this but that doesn't mean it can't be abuse. I've had a lot of friends who are drug addicts and that's what it feels like whenever I hang out with him. \n\nDo I just accept it and put up with it? Is it possible there is drug abuse going on?

She probably just didn't know what to do or misinterpreted how serious my concerns were. Either way, without a referral my options are getting evaluated, joining a clinical trial (if I qualify), or joining a training clinic in a nearby county. All of these options have 6-12+ month waitlists. Then I'll likely be assigned CBT and maybe medication. I don't want to take stimulants because I have SUD and I don't want to deal with getting 90 day supplies refilled of a C-2 prescription during a national shortage. I've also tried the song and dance of medication trial and error before between 6 different anti-depressants, 5 anti-anxiety meds, and 1 psychotropic med. \n\nI'm 28 and I've never been diagnosed or evaluated. What I wanna know is all of this hoop jumping worth it? I'm thinking I'm just gonna seek a therapist who specializes in CBT and learn healthy coping mechanisms until one day I can realistically approach getting evaluated. My goal is to improve my life without leaving myself and my family financially destitute because of the costs associated with evaluation and treatment. Will getting evaluated and diagnosed make enough of a difference in my life? Especially if I already know I don't want to try stimulant medication? Aren't they just going to tell me to seek CBT?",
