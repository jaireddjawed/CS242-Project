TL;DR: a subset of new users (and soon all of them) will encounter /r/popular when they sign up until they accumulate enough subscriptions (via a tutorial sort of discovery page) to see a customized front page. \n\nI think this is overall a good change; it decreases the monopoly default subreddits maintain on popularity and voting, and forces new users to have a little more engagement with the communities they select. It also gives more attention to previously smaller and more niche subreddits, though this could have the downside of introducing users who don't yet \"get\" it into the mix of a community of seasoned redditors.",

        "text": "...a bold statement but the current algorithm isn't getting trending news stories onto users pages due to the posts not getting enough upvotes to compete with other submissions on this site. Hear me out, but the whole Berkeley situation has been trending all day on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of people tweeting about the whole situation. When I came to Reddit it just wasn't anywhere to be found on the first 10+ pages and you had to search the news sub to find it halfway down the page. \n\nI was the first user to post an article about it on /r/news, you can see the thread [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/65l9le/right_leftwing_protesters_clash_in_berkeley/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=news) for reference. As you can see the post itself isn't in a controversial upvote to downvote ratio and is sitting at around 90% approval. Now heres why I'm making this post if you look at how many comments have been posted it's just over 1,400 comments but it has barely scraped over 500 upvotes. That is insane to think that's so much user activity it's on par with the top posts on /r/all currently and is almost double the current comments on the top post on the sub, but isn't considered to be on the front page of the internet due to the current karma system.\n\nI love the karma system but it is deeply flawed when it comes to posts like mine that have high user traffic but has the karma level of a controversial post even though it's sitting fairly positive. This has happened multiple times on this site where important news stories are just missed even though they are trending worldwide on all the other major social media sites but Reddit is silent even though thousands of users are discussing it. What I'm trying to suggest that is we as a community need a trending tab. No I'm not talking about the rising tab, I'm talking for a tab that is dependent on user comments volume instead of user karma sort of like how twitter runs their trending algorithm. Thoughts?

Suggestions on how to best phrase the request? tl;dr awkward question, how to ask it kindly?\"]\n\nI'd always heard the memes about how breaking up was the only answer that r/relationships really offered, but I was surprised to see it firsthand. One of the commenters mentioned how if the genders were reversed, the reaction would be entirely different. I was curious to see if this would bear out.\n\n[The mods deleted the thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/648k2w/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_thinks_his_mustache_looks/) (not sure why), but here's the text;\n\n\"He's had it since before we were dating (3 months). It's wispy and patchy. I haven't brought it up yet and I'm not sure how to do so without hurting his feelings.\n\ntl;dr justaches never look good.\"\n\n________________________\n\nFirst of all, my hypothesis was quickly disproved. The majority of comments mirrored those in my original post; stating that I shouldn't ask to change my SO's appearance. \n\nIn the original thread (asking as a guy in regards to his GF), of 11 top-level comments 54% said not to ask, 18% took a middle approach and 27% said I should be free to ask.\n\nIn the experimental thread (asking as a girl in regards to her BF), of 16 top-level comments 50% said not to ask, 19% took a middle approach and 31% said I should be free to ask.\n\nAlmost identical results!\n\n____________________\n\nThe difference is in the tone of the comments and the responses I got. \n\nMy original thread was downvoted below 0. The experimental thread was at +72 when the mods deleted it. \n\nIn my original thread, I was repeatedly asked to justify my preference, and was frequently told I was either superficial or unreasonable. Of the 11 top-level comments, 36% asked me to justify why I would prefer for my gf not to have peach fuzz. There was no such response when asking as a girl in regards to her BF. This is in spite of slightly harsher language in the OP (\"justaches never look good\")\n\nThe discussion in the original thread was much more bitter and inflammatory. Long arguments quickly developed between multiple commenters, and those in the minority were heavily downvoted. There was essentially no argument in the experimental thread; 76 total comments in the original thread vs 26 in the experimental. \n\n_________________________\n\nConclusions;\n\nYou will likely get the same advice in /r/relationships posting as either a man or a woman, but the way in which you are given this advice may be vastly different. Based on this very small sample size, as a man you're much more likely to get downvoted and criticized, and have your preferences questioned. I want to emphasize that this was a small and unscientific test, but the results indicate that r/relationships is significantly friendlier to female posters. \n\n",

        "text": "***\n\n**Original with in-line images: http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/** \n\n***\n\nLast weekend, a fascinating act in the history of humanity played out on Reddit.\n\nFor April Fool's Day, Reddit launched a little experiment. It gave its users, who are all anonymous, a blank canvas called [Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). \n\nThe rules were simple. Each user could choose one pixel from 16 colors to place anywhere on the canvas. They could place as many pixels of as many colors as they wanted, but they had to wait a few minutes between placing each one.  \n\nOver the following 72 hours, what emerged was nothing short of miraculous. A collaborative artwork that shocked even its inventors. \n\nFrom a single blank canvas, a couple simple rules and no plan, came this:\n\n[Timelapse of Reddit Place](http://spacescience.tech/place/)\n\nEach pixel you see was placed by hand. Each icon, each flag, each meme created painstakingly by millions of people who had nothing in common except an Internet connection. Somehow, someway, what happened in Reddit over those 72 hours was the birth of Art.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nWhile I followed Place closely, I cannot do justice to the story behind it in the few words here. There were countless dramas -- countless ideas, and fights, and battles, and wars -- that I don't even know about. They happened in small forums and private Discord chats, with too much happening at once, all the time, to keep track of everything. And, of course, I had to sleep.\n\nBut at its core, the story of Place is an eternal story, about the three forces that humanity needs to make art, creation, and technology possible.\n\n## The Creators\n\nFirst came the Creators. They were the artists to whom the blank canvas was an irresistible opportunity. \n\nWhen Place was launched, with no warning, the first users started placing pixels willy-nilly, just to see what they could do. Within minutes, the [first sketches](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62mm1i/125k_redditors_clicks_came_together_and_produced/) appeared on Place. Crude and immature, they resembled cavemen paintings, the work of artists just stretching their wings.\n\nEven from that humble beginning, the Creators quickly saw that the pixels held power, and lots of potential. But working alone, they could only place one pixel every 5 or 10 minutes. Making anything more meaningful would take forever -- if someone didn't mess up their work as they were doing it. To make something bigger, they would have to work together.\n\nThat's when someone hit on the brilliant notion of a gridmap. They took a simple idea -- a drawing overlaid on a grid, that showed where each of the pixels should go -- and combined it with an image that resonated with the adolescent humor of Redditors. They proposed drawing [Dickbutt](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62mfmx/make_a_dickbutt_please/).\n\nThe Placetions (denizens of r/place) quickly got to work. It didn't take long -- Dickbutt materialized within minutes in the lower left part of the  canvas. The Place had its first collaborative Art.\n\nBut Creators didn't stop there. They added more appendages to the creature, they added colors, and then they attempted to metamorphize their creation into [Dickbutterfly](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62n7j8/glory_to_the_church_of_the_pinkbrown/). Behind its silliness was the hint of a creative tsunami about to come.\n\nBut it didn't happen all at once. Creators started to get a little drunk on their power. Across the canvas from Dickbutt, a small Charmander came to life. But once the Pokemon character was brought to life, it started [growing](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62n7e5/charmander_whats_wrong_with_your_leg/) a large male member where once had been a leg. Then came [two more](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62nxla/we_cant_let_the_blue_corner_take_over_triple_dick/). \n\nThis was not by design. Some Creators frantically tried to remove the offending additions, putting out calls to \"purify\" the art, but others kept the additions going. \n\nSuddenly, it looked like Place would be a short-lived experiment that took the path of least surprise. Left to their own devices, Creators threatened to turn the Place into a phallic fantasy. Of course.\n\nThe problem was less one of immaturity, and more of the fundamental complexity of the creative process. What the Creators were starting to face was something that would become the defining theme of Place: too much freedom leads to chaos. Creativity needs constraint as much as it needs freedom. \n\nWhen anyone could put any pixel anywhere, how does it not lead immediately to mayhem?\n\n\n## The Protectors\n\nAnother set of users emerged, who would soon address this very problem. \n\nBut like the primitive Creators, they weren't yet self-aware of their purpose on the great white canvas. Instead, they began by simplifying the experiment into a single goal: world conquest.\n\nThey formed Factions around colors, that they used to take over the Place with. The [Blue Corner](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueCorner/) was among the first, and by far the largest. It began in the bottom right corner and spread like a plague. Its followers self-identified with the color, claiming that its manifest destiny was to take over Place. Pixel by pixel, they started turning it into reality, in a [mad land grab](http://i.imgur.com/yb41inH.png) over the wide open space.\n\nThe Blue Corner wasn't alone. Another group started a [Red Corner](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedCorner/) on the other side of the canvas. Their users claimed a leftist political leaning. Yet another started the [Green Lattice](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenLattice/), which went for a polka-dot design with interspersing green pixels and white. They championed their superior efficiency, since they only had to color half as many pixels as the other Factions.\n\nIt wasn't long before the Factions ran head-on into the Creators. Charmander was among the first battle sites. As the Blue Corner began to overwrite the Pokemon with blue pixels, the Creators turned from their internecine phallic wars to the bigger threat now on their doorstep. \n\nThey fought back, replacing each blue pixel with their own. But the numbers were against them. With its single-minded focus on expansion, the Blue Corner commanded a much larger army than the Creators could muster. So they did the only thing they could do. They [pled](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62nxla/we_cant_let_the_blue_corner_take_over_triple_dick/) for their lives.\n\nSomehow, it struck a chord. It ignited a debate within the Blue Corner. What was their role in relation to Art? A member [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62nmp0/order_of_blue_we_must_make_a_decision/): \"As our tide inevitably covers the world from edge to edge, should we show mercy to other art we come across?\" \n\nThis was a question each Faction faced in turn. With all the power given to them by their expansionary zeal, what were they to do about the art that stood in their path? \n\nThey all decided to [save](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62qe0p/rebel_against_bluegoisie_all_you_want_but_lets/) it. One by one, each of the Factions began flowing around the artwork, rather than through them. \n\n&gt; [\"Rebel against Bluegoisie all you want, but let's make one thing clear: THESE THREE ARE OFF ABSOLUTELY OFF LIMITS. THEY ARE NOT TO BE HARMED.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62qe0p/rebel_against_bluegoisie_all_you_want_but_lets/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=embed)\n\nThis was a turning point. The mindless Factions had turned into beneficent Protectors.\n\n## Still No Happy Ending\n\nFinally at peace with the ravenous color horde, the Creators turned back to their creations. They started making them more complex, adding one element after another. \n\nThey started using 3-pixel fonts to write text. A [Star Wars prequel meme](https://i.redd.it/987d76yjy8py.jpg) that had been sputtering along took a more defined shape, becoming one of the most prominent pieces of art in Place.\n\nOthers formed Creator collectives around common projects. Organizing in smaller subreddits that they created just for this purpose, they planned strategies and shared templates.\n\nOne of the most successful was a [group](https://www.reddit.com/r/placestart/) that added a Windows 95-esque taskbar along the bottom, replete with Start button in the corner. \n\nAnother were a [block of hearts](https://www.reddit.com/r/placehearts/). They started with only a few, mimicking hearts of life in old bitmap video games, like Zelda, before their collective took off with the idea. By the end they [stretched](https://i.redd.it/buq8fe6uddpy.jpg) across half the canvas, in a dazzling array of flags and designs. \n\nAnd of course, there was [Van Gogh](https://www.reddit.com/r/starryknights/).\n\nBut not all was well. The Protectors who they had once welcomed with relief had become tyrants dictating fashion. They decided what could and couldn't be made. It wasn't long before Creators started [chafing](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/636xjc/i_used_to_hate_the_void_but_watching_the/dfrxpm3/) under their rule.\n\nMeanwhile, with the issue of artwork resolved, the Factions had turned their sights on each other, forcing followers to [choose sides](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62o90f/i_defected_from_the_blue_corner_this_is_my_story/) in epic battles. They had little time to pay attention to the pathetic pleas of Creators who wanted approval for ideas of new art.\n\nThe fights between the Protectors got nasty. A Twitch live-streamer [exhorted](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePixels/comments/62rpiw/a_streamer_named_destiny_is_leading_an_attack_on/) his followers to attack the Blue Corner with Purple. There were [battle plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePixels/comments/62oqzh/plan_of_attack/). There were [appeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePixels/comments/62oz1v/do_not_let_this_be_the_future_we_live_in/) to emotion. There were even false-flag attacks, where the followers of one color placed pixels of the opposing side inside their own, just so they could cry foul and attack in return. \n\nBut the biggest problem of all was one of the only hard rules of Place -- it couldn't grow. With the Factions engaged in a massive battle among themselves, the Creators started realizing there wasn't space to make new Art. \n\nCountry flags had started emerging pretty much from the beginning. But as they grew and grew, they started bumping into each other. \n\nOut in the unclaimed territory of the middle of the canvas, with no Protector to mediate between them, Germany and France engaged in an [epic battle](https://i.imgur.com/rnpSbm3.gif) that sent shockwaves through Place. \n\nSuddenly, a world that had been saved from its primitive beginnings looked like it would succumb to war. There were frantic attempts at diplomacy between all sides. Leaders form the Protectors and the Creators and met each other in chat rooms, but mostly they just pointed fingers at each other. \n\nWhat Place needed was a villain that everyone could agree upon.\n\n## The Destroyers\n\nEnter the Void. \n\nThey started on 4chan, Reddit's mangled, red-headed step-brother. It wasn't long before the pranksters on the Internet's  most notorious imageboard took notice of what was happening on Reddit. It was too good an opportunity for them to pass up. And so they turned to the color closest to their heart -- black. They became the Void. \n\nLike a [tear spreading slowly](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/238/626/c8b.png) across the canvas, black pixels started emerging near the center of Place. \n\nAt first, other Factions tried to form an [alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62orvz/whites_greys_dark_greys_black_unite_under_the/) with them, foolishly assuming that diplomacy would work. But they failed, because the Void was different.\n\nThe Void was no Protector. Unlike the Factions, it professed no loyalty to Art. Followers of the Void championed its destructive egalitarianism, [chanting](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/633pn3/we_are_the_void_this_is_why_we_consume/) only that \"the Void will consume.\" They took no sides. They only wanted to paint the world black.\n\nThis was exactly the kick in the ass that Place needed. While Creators had been busy fighting each other, and Protectors still measured themselves by the extent of canvas they controlled, a new threat -- a real threat -- had emerged under their nose.\n\nAgainst the face of extinction, they banded together to fight the Void and save their Art.\n\nBut the Void was not easy to vanquish, because the Place needed it. It needed destruction so that new Art, better Art, would emerge from the ashes. Without the Void, there was no force to clean up the old Art. \n\n&gt; [I used to hate the Void but watching the time-lapses I see they're a vital part of the r/place ecosystem. Like a forest fire making way for new life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/636xjc/i_used_to_hate_the_void_but_watching_the/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=embed)\n\nAnd so, by design or not, the Void gave birth to some of the largest Art in the Place. \n\nTake, for example, the part of the canvas right in the center. Almost since the very beginning, it had been one of the most contested areas on the map. Time and again, Creators had tried to claim the territory for their own. First with icons. Then with a coordinated attempt at a [prism](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/comments/62ukk0/pink_floyd_prism_top_post_on_rplace/). \n\nBut the Void ate them all. Art after art succumbed to its ravenous appetite for chaos. \n\nAnd yet, this was _exactly_ what Place needed. By destroying art, the Void forced Placetions to come up with something better. They knew they could overcome the sourge. They just needed an idea good enough, with enough momentum and enough followers, to beat the black monster.\n\nThat idea was the [American flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanFlaginPlace/). \n\nIn the last day of Place, a most unlikely coalition came together to beat back the Void, once and for all. \n\nThey were people who otherwise tear each other apart every day -- Trump supporters and Trump resisters, Democrats and Republicans, Americans and Europeans. And here they were coming together to build something together, on a little corner of the Internet, proving in an age when such cooperation seems impossible, that they still can.\n\n[Victory at last](https://gfycat.com/ifr/EqualHeavenlyBug)\n\n## The Ancients Were Right\n\nReddit's experiment ended soon after. There are so many more stories hidden deep in the [dozens of subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/haykam821/m/place/) and chat rooms that cropped up around Place. For [every](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/634mce/idea_the_rainbow_road_needs_a_banana_on_it/) [piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/62mphn/dear_other_people_working_on_send_nudes_at_the/) of [artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6316x8/one_of_the_best_things_that_happend_in_the_canvas/dfqquxb/) I mentioned, there are hundreds more on the [final canvas](https://www.reddit.com/place?webview=true). Perhaps the most amazing thing is that on an anonymous, no-holds-barred space on the Internet, there were no hate or racist symbols at all.\n\nIt is a beautiful circle of art, life and death. And it isn't the first time in our history that we've seen it. \n\nMany millenia before Place, when humanity itself was still in its infancy (the real one, not the one on Reddit), Hindu philosophers theorized that the Heavens were made of three competing, but necessary, deities that they called the [Trimurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti). They were Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Protector, and Shiva the Destroyer. \n\nWithout any single one of them, the Universe would not work. For there to be light, there needed to be dark. For there to be life, there needed to be death. For there to be creation and art, there needed to be destruction.\n\nOver the last few days, their vision proved prescient. In the most uncanny way, Reddit proved that human creation requires all three.",

You can get some insight to a person's character by doing this. Of course, it probably isn't very credible, but still very interesting. \n\nFor example, I saw that there was a swastika being created on the Swiss flag. So I checked who was obviously altering the cross, and many of them were subscribers and regular posters of /r/The_Donald. I am not making this up.\n\nSome are more obvious. Undertale references were made by users who visit /r/undertale. Same for mylittlepony responsible for one of the ponies, League of Legends for Teemo, PCMasterrace for their logo, patriots for their respective flags, etc.\n\nOut of curiosity, I checked /b/ on 4chan to see if there was a brigade, and sure enough there was. They were responsible for the pepes and the REEEE- that you see on it. I can only assume that the users responsible for these pixels are also regular 4chan users.\n\nThis also reached out to the massive lurker userbase that Reddit has. I was constantly finding people who never posted anything at all, but have been a part of Reddit for years. So many users that had 5+ years without posting anything. Fascinating.\n\nI have never been more intrigued in the longest time. This is the most entertaining experiment I've ever witnessed. Absolutely brilliantly well-done.\n\nJoin me in this game of guessing which subs a user frequents based on the pixel they made. It's so entertaining.\n\n\nedit: fixed some things",

So it appears that there is still something fishy going on. \n\n#what we need now from people with ads.reddit.com accounts is to see if there are other subreddits with a misrepresentation at the same level of The_Donald (a factor of 35 greater than the average) before it could be suggested that T_D is in fact being singled out. \n\n--------------\n\n**UPDATE 2**\n\n#I MESSED UP, [HERE IS THE LINK SHOWING THE PERCENTAGE MISREPRESENTATION](https://archive.is/UkycK/6b3be0c7cd2bd69c453d3bd4e8e3b6141f0abce0.png)\n\nalso let me more clearly define how the Misrepresentation factor is calculated:\n\n#[ (ads.reddit.com Subscriber count) - (displayed subscriber count) ] / displayed subscriber count = Misrepresentation Factor\n\nfor the_donald that would be:\n\n#[ (5,719,001) - (385,247) ] / 385,247 = 14.845 = 1485%\n\n-------------------------------\n\nu/runDNA found a [subreddit with a misrepresentation factor of 1003%](https://np.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/62fake/weve_launched_a_completely_revamped_selfserve_ads/dfnlup8/) (r/elitedangerous)\n\nlet's see if we can find some more\n\n--------------\n\n**UPDATE 3**\n\n[the bug has been fixed](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/62fake/weve_launched_a_completely_revamped_selfserve_ads/dfnt0lu/) (thanks u/JIPPIEJEE)\n\nnow ads.reddit.com shows [impressions instead of subs](https://i.imgur.com/RPziPNR.png)\n\nSo looks like any further research into this is impossible, I am sure that T_Ders will maintain that this was a proof of some internal algorithmic bias unless given definitive proof. So if you have any other screen caps of sub-counts from the bug that show Misrepresentation factors close to 1485% send them here and I will update!\n\nu/AkiraErebos claims that he [found some that came close and one that surpassed that number](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/62mi64/how_much_credence_do_you_give_to_recent_findings/dfnto6o/) but sadly didn't provide screencaps. His number he gave for r/politics sub count on ads.reddit.com (39,000,000 vs 3,000,000) is significantly higher than other screencaps I have seen of that one (6,000,000 vs 3,000,000) which makes me question those numbers. ~~But **if he is correct**, the fact that r/oddlysatisfying has a factor of 2695% to me means that the whole premise is bogus. **IF**~~\n\n~~So if you have any more screencaps send em to me but if we don't find proof of other Misrepresentation Factors in the same range as T_D we can't say one way or the other whether there is reason to believe it was singled out.~~\n\n---------------\n\n#Final Update: claim DEBUNKED. \n\nu/AkiraErebos gave [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/sFOrS) which puts r/oddlysatisfying at a Misrepresentation Factor of 2695%, significantly higher than T_D's 1485% \n\nfrom this and the other subreddits that are close (r/politics = 1181%) it's reasonable to assume that there was no \"suppression\" of T_D's subscriber count by the mods.

For one, it’s probably not universal among Trump supporters; nearly 63 million Americans voted for Trump, and the 382,000 members of r/The_Donald represent less than 1 percent of that. But in the subreddit’s vocal and dedicated membership, you can find an influential strain of Trump boosterism. According to former staffers, the Trump campaign team monitored the subreddit for messages that resonated, and Trump himself participated in an “Ask Me Anything” on r/The_Donald in July. Since the election, the subreddit has continued to serve as a conduit through which fringe conspiracy theories — often started on sites like 4chan.org, a freewheeling image-based message board best known for creating memes, posting stolen celebrity nudes and birthing the hacker collective Anonymous — enter a larger online discourse. \n\n ",

This also makes it possible to do what we call “subreddit algebra”: adding one subreddit to another and seeing if the result resembles some third subreddit, or subtracting out a component of one subreddit’s character and seeing what’s left.

About a third of the stuff I created was in response to something I read on reddit.  I was banned before the rules were changed. My detractors complained that it was links to youtube or links to pages that had an adsense banner, so I was making money.  Yet most of the posts of those same people were to sites that were obscenely commercial, and their posts appeared to mostly be to the same site - as if they owned that site, or were paid by that site.\n\nI remember a reddit post about how great CFLs were.  I typed a respose and three hours later I had to move my massive response to a text editor.  And then I found I wanted to add tables, images and videos, so I made it html and stuck it on one of my domains.  I then created two youtube videos and embedded those.  All of this in response to just one post on reddit.  It ended up taking months to get it all just right.  \n\nBut linking to that is not allowed.  \n\nI suppose I could do what other people do:  create a sock puppet and post under that. But that just seems .... not the way I want to fly.  \n\nMake 90% of my links be links to other stuff:  if I find something interesting, I would rather glue it together with pictures and videos of similar things and then compose a more holistic response.  If I find something interesting, it already tends to be posted to reddit.  \n\nSome people are allowed to post just their own stuff.  Boobs om imgur come to mind.  Celebs.  A few others.  \n\nI saw this a couple of years ago and really grooved on it.  I thought it would lead to some awesome changes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOtuEDgYTwI - no such luck?\n\nI should add one last thing:  before being banned, I had two or three stalkers that felt that I should never post anything.  At least one of them had about 25 sockpuppets.  I would post something and over three hours it would rise to about 22 upvotes and then BAM, within four minutes it would have -3 votes.  I think these people regularly campaigned the subreddits I would frequent to have me banned from a few, so I suspect that they reached out to admins to get my account banned.  \n\ntl;dr: i wish for reddit to be like the old days where i could write a media rich essay or post a youtube video and link to that to see what redditors thought.",
