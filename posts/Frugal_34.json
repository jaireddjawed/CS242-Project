Generic cartridges are a lot cheaper, but I have also heard that they can ruin your printer or not print well.

Are there brands (ideally accessible in Australia) that will work well with my printer? Or is it better to get the brother branded refills?",

I am always hesitant to order food that I cannot physically touch.\n\nThanks in advance.",

It came with 5 safety razors blades, which is what I’m currently using. \n\nI used it for the first time a couple days ago. Two things I noticed: \n\n1) it seems harder to control than a disposable razor. This I wrote off as something I’ll need to just get used to. \n\n2) this one is more of an issue. I notice I’m getting razor burn/bumps when I’ve never got them before. I’m not too surprised either because it feels a bit scratchy when shaving, particularly my neck. \n\nI’m wondering if the poor control is possibly specific to this particular razor. Also, is it possible the razor burn/scratching is due to the 5 safety razor blades it came with being poor quality? Or, is this all expected: it’s cheaper, but you don’t get as good of a shave as a 2/3-blade disposable razor?\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "I would assume, being frugal, we would be all for such websites as \"Freecycle\" (now \"Buy Nothing\" pages on Facebook, etc.), but they kind of bother me for two reasons: one, the waste.  Of course, it's better than just throwing it away or setting it on the curb, and it's not \"wasted\" if someone else can use it, but it's just the ease and lack of concern with which so many people simply get rid of perfectly good, never used, even valuable items they could resell instead.  It doesn't seem very fiscally smart.  Secondly, a lot of that stuff would bring good money at thrift shops for charity.  If you don't like Goodwill or Salvation Army, there are increasingly little thrift shops whose proceeds benefit animal shelters, women's shelters, church closets that clothe the homeless or women returning to work after welfare, etc. where it could do so much good.  I guess it's easier to have people come to you rather than pack it up and bring it to these places, and they also say it's fun to meet new people.  \n\nThoughts?",

I can't take much more and know eventually I'm either gonna end shit cause I won't be able to take being beat up on everyday, or it's gonna go too far and someone's gonna damage me too much to fix it. It's a shitty predicament. \nI don't have much. I have a car my dad helps pay for but I pay $250 of the bill each month, and I have a bachelor's degree in psychology which was a dumb choice. I can eat simple. I can eat chicken thighs and rice and chicken and veggies for awhile if I really need, but to be honest I know despite my father's inability to get me out of abuse he would not let me starve and would bring me food if I was desperate. \n\nI want to be alone and I want to be free. I've started delivering Instacart- pathetic, I know, my mom says its a job for dummies but it's better than zero. Every day I try to stick some earnings in savings. Today was slow and with getting myself chicken and fruit I only had $20 to put in savings, but this week I made $500. I work my ass off all day and get to avoid this hellhole so it's a start. So far in savings I have $2090 saved. I know it's not much but it is a start. I'm going to get myself a lunchbox when I earn enough money to spare the $30 so I can not worry about buying lunch out on the go during work. \n\nI live in Tampa so 1 bedrooms start at like $1300-1400 around here unfortunately. I know this will take a little while but I want to save and NEVER come back. A recommended amount or any tips is so appreciated. Roommates are not an ideal option. I have severe PTSD from years of abuse and need to find the he freedom to heal in my own space. Thank you for any help.",

        "text": "(ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO IMPROVE IS WELCOME. I AM AT A LOSS) So for context, I (22F) am a full-time nursing student, a mom, and I work night shift full-time to try and make ends meet. This past year is the first time I have really struggled financially. My husband (22M) had back surgery last year (which kind of triggered the financial struggle) and currently, it is just me trying to provide for our little family of three. I don't get paid a lot, but I have tried everything I can to help make things easier and less stressful in our home. We have changed our phone plan to the bare minimum, unplug electronics that aren't being used, never turn the lights on if not needed, we don't have wifi, we don't pay rent, and we only have liability on our car. We have applied for govt. assistance to no avail. I am on my 4th appeal to see if I will be approved but apparently, my income is too high which is ridiculous as I only make \\~$1200/month. I was able to get Medicaid for my family though. My entire paycheck is currently going towards our utilities and we have not been able to get proper groceries in a long time. Every now and again we are able to receive some groceries from the Food Bank. This past week I paid our electricity which was an outrageous $894 along with our mobile phones and water bill. I just got to work tonight and noticed a tire on my car is about to blow out ( the wires are showing pretty badly) and I am 25 miles from the nearest tire shop to get a used tire. I need an alignment but no shop will align my tires due to needing parts in my suspension replaced. The work that needs to be done is \\~$800 and I am budgeting to the point we only have $10 every two weeks for groceries. We aren't able to save money very well at all due to lower income along with the high utility bills. We double-checked to make sure our electric bill was correct, and it was. Our energy company is charging insanely high fuel and storm damage repair fees. Long story short, I am stuck at work with a tire that could blow out any second and I am not sure what to do. My family basically keeps telling me that I am not budgeting hard enough when I haven't even had the money for groceries or to drive anywhere other than work or school. I am doing my best so my son is taken care of first. I always make sure he has enough food, drink, and supplies before I worry about myself and my husband does the same. I don't understand what I am doing wrong. I am working as hard as I can and it seems like as soon as one issue is resolved another pops up. I know a used tire isn't very expensive, but it was just the break for me. I am hoping that the tire stays intact so that I can have it replaced in town. I am just having to trust that everything will work out, but I am struggling mentally. I am trying, but I don't understand why it isn't enough.",

Musings for another day, I suppose lol)\n\nAs I stand in my kitchen toiling over what to make for dinner, I made myself a proper “thinking sandwich” out of semi-sad low carb bread (it was on clearance at Kroger and sliced so thin I can’t believe they can call it bread) and 87cents per lb clearance spiral sliced ham with crunchy glaze. And this sandwich slaps! It is definitely worth the slight sodium increase from a normal snack.\n\nWhenever I make a sandwich, which isn’t too often, I am always so satisfied with how simple and delicious they are! Looking back, many of my best frugal lunches contained some type of sandwich. I used to be a sucker for a cheap PB&amp;J. I still am, but apparently sugar and salt should be eaten in smaller quantities. Did anyone else know this?\n\nNow it’s time to freeze the rest of the ham for future breakfasts, soups, and yes, plenty of sandwiches.\n\nSo I raise my sandwich to you, my fellow Frugalitarians. Cheers to those who can’t pass up a great deal even though you’ve been eating ham for weeks and weeks. And to all the rest of you, I admire your restraint and raise my Sammy to you anyway. \n\nHappy 2023, everyone!\n\nTl;dr - Clearance ham good and sandwiches rule :)",

I usually buy Vera Bradley crossbody bags but I don't like that they're not made in the US anymore and the price has gone through the roof.
