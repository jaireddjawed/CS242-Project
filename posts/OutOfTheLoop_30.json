So if you scroll all the way back they don’t have any posts before September of 2021 even though they had an Instagram for the entire time that they have been a band \n\n[animals as leaders](https://instagram.com/animalsasleaders?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)",

They flash their high beams as they pass so it blinds my side mirrors. Not everyone does this, but its only happened recently. I've checked my car and there's no head/tailights out, and I'm almost always going 5-10 over the posted speed limit already. Middle lane and right lane too so ample room to pass without me having to move out of the way. I just don't understand why, and why its been happening more often recently. Is it just more aggressive drivers being common more recently or is this all in my head and always been around? I've checked Wikipedia ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlight_flashing#:~:text=Flashing%20can%20indicate%20the%20intention,of%20a%20faster%20following%20driver.) And all it references is in regards to the person who has just been passed signaling to the driver who just passed them not the other way around. And just for clarification they're flashing me as they're passing me.",
