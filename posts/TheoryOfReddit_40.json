        "text": "As I watch the reaction to the firing of Victoria (in the comments and downvoting patterns on Pao-related posts, and in the majority of upvoted content, which reflects either an apathy or a desire to move on), I’m thinking that Reddit consists of two communities that can be defined by how upset they are at the firing of Victoria and at Ellen Pao.  They always existed, but recent events make the differences more visible. \n\nIt’s important to note that the size of these two factions are not as easy to measure as it initially seems. Anti-Pao sentiment (and, more generally, strong emotions about anything) is highly visible and obvious while the size of the other group must be inferred by the fact that the vast majority of content on the site has nothing to do with Victoria or Pao.  The first group is much more highly invested in the site than the second group  – it likely consists of a greater proportion of moderators, power users, and people who bother to up/downvote Pao-related posts.  But the second group is likely larger. As u/Darth_Hobbes [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3c58qc/has_the_recent_movement_in_reaction_to_victorias/), the smaller, angrier group is likely a combination of mods with legitimate gripes and people who are predisposed to expressing hate. The inability of those sub-groups to stay separate is a common problem, in politics and online communities, as [pointed by](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3c58qc/has_the_recent_movement_in_reaction_to_victorias/cssce7j) u/adminbeast.\n\nSo, do these two communities continue to coexist as before once this dies down? Do they splinter into different subreddits? Or does the smaller group pick up and leave for another site (8chan leaving 4chan seems like a relevant precedent)?\n",

Instead of just working with them once a year to promote something via AMA, we want to be a resource to help them to actually join the reddit community (Arnold does this remarkably well).\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/csu0kmv?context=1)\n\nMy impression from this is that the Reddit admins/leadership believes that by making it really easy for a celebrity to do an AMA the celebrities see reddit as nothing more than a one-off interview instead of a community they would consider being more involved in.  Instead of just answering some questions over the phone that Victoria transcribes, maybe if they have to actually make an account and get involved themselves they'll decide to stay and become more regular users.\n\nI think this is an interesting idea and not something I had considered before now as the reason for Victoria being let go.  But the question is, will raising the bar and making it more difficult for a celebrity to do an AMA mean that less of them bother doing an AMA and/or that their AMAs sometimes become disasters like in the past before Victoria, or will it have the desired effect of getting them to stay and become redditers?\n\nFor the purposes of this post I want to ignore how horribly this all actually played out and how badly it was (or wasn't) communicated to the mods and to reddit in general.  I'm just interested in whether this strategy will actually work to get high profile people to join the reddit community.",

I don't believe that reddit has failed as a social media or news aggregate platform, but I do feel that the site has reached a critical mass on several different fronts that pose as hazards to its ability to thrive. Simply put, it becomes increasingly difficult for communities to prosper while they experience states of turmoil. Many reddit communities have so far remained insulated from what has happened, but there will most likely be lasting repercussions to be felt in the future.\n\nI see the future of reddit as a resurgence to decentralized communities spread across individual websites. Rather than aggregates dominating the activity of discussions, I see a rise in stand alone websites existing as focused communities. The structure of these websites will most likely remain similar to reddit due to its functionality and familiarity, but each can be tailor made to the community's needs.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "Meta events often create quite a few posts here on ToR. The most recent events have been the firing of Reddit employees, blackout of subreddits, and banning of harassing subreddits. These events often have a handful or more removed posts because of their content. Let's just go over what us moderators usually remove during these meta events:\n\n* Theory-less, general meta content: general meta news or drama that is more appropriate for /r/metahub, /r/SubredditDrama, or other meta subreddits.\n\n* Drama-inducing posts. This can be intentional or unintentional. Sometimes, like the recent FPH banning, certain posts can bait unwanted, uncivil discussions/users/communities into ToR. You should generally stick to the affected communities if you want to engage in drama or make a post that might invite it, or if they don't allow it, consider posting to /r/self.\n\n* Witch hunts. Not appropriate anywhere and we will report your actions to the admins.\n\n* Complaining. While posts with adequate theory that complain a bit are okay, general whining or complaining posts are better suited for /r/circlebroke. If they don't allow it, consider /r/self. Complaining about moderator abuse should probably go to /r/subredditcancer or /r/self.\n\n* Reddit features. This should go to /r/ideasfortheadmins. From the sidebar: \"This subreddit should focus on data, issues, solutions, or strategies that could be reasonably addressed or implemented by users and moderators, not admins.\"\n\nPlease also take a moment to review our On-Topic Statement:\n\n&gt;**Theory of Reddit is a mildly navel-gazing space for inquiring into what makes Reddit communities work and what we in a community can do to help make it better.**\n\n&gt;**This is a moderated/curated subreddit. Submissions determined to fall outside of the stated topic will be removed by the moderators.**",

What is to stop the operator of such a subreddit from using it as a traffic driver by setting it to private (for the sake of disabling the subreddit) and leaving a message that says, for example, \"Join us at beerit.com\" when you type in /r/beer ? The disadvantage is that not everyone will go, and their reddit accounts won't carry over to that other site, but a lot of traffic will follow and create new accounts at beerit.com, and something is better than nothing in this case. They can then run a reddit-like forum on that site to retain the qualified traffic that is looking for, and expecting, a beer forum, then plaster it with ads, sell the traffic, and generally operate it however they see fit.\n\nIs there anything to stop that from theoretically happening?

Tell them you are willing to shorten their ban, if they are willing to never do whatever they were banned for again. They will happily agree, and think they were given a second chance, when in reality you were only going to temporarily ban them, anyways.

Because whenever I do mention my age, I always seem to get more downvotes and at least one individual seems to want to disagree with me.\n\nI'll give an example of something that happened recently.  There was a top comment on a post about schools (this is important) that was getting lots of positive attention.  I left a comment agreeing with it, but mentioned that I was a senior.  Out of nowhere someone who obviously is a teacher felt they needed to leave a long-winded explanation about why I was wrong, telling me multiple times that I just wasn't old enough to understand the situation in question.  I tried explaining to them my opinion in the most unbiased way why I held the opinion I did.  Then they left yet another long-winded comment that again alluded the \"you're too young to understand, but I'm not going to bother explaining it to you anyway\" speech.  I checked back at my comment history and saw a parade of downvotes coming in, especially on the original comment that mentioned my age.\n\nThis wouldn't have been too out of the ordinary, but dozens of other commentors left virtually the same comment that I did, just not mentioning their age.  Why is it that the only comment that mentions someone age somehow is the only one that gets caught in arguments and downvotes?  This has happened multiple times now.  I have the same opinion as OP, add on to it and mention my age because it's relevant, then I'm the only commentor greeted with downvotes, often with at least one \"you're only in high school.  You just don't understand yet\" thrown in there as if I'm not capable of understanding grownup issues.\n\nThen I got thinking about the whole \"Summer Reddit\" phenomenon and how Reddit seems to get unusually shitty June to September when what it considers to be sub-par content is posted.  Most who stop and think about it realize it's just another scapegoat to blame poor content on, but there are quite a few Redditors who clearly feel teens ruin the site.\n\nHas anyone ever tested this out and confirmed it to be the case?  Or am I just really unlikely with the people I attract?  I would be more apt to believe it was something I was saying, but Reddit really seems to like me when I don't mention my age—and again, this isn't \"I'm 17 and I'm mature for my age\", I only mention my age or grade when I know it actually contributes something to the conversation.\n\nThoughts?",

Eventually, they'll be encountered *all throughout* reddit--often multiple times--in all sorts of subs--and then become widely shared among redditors. \n\nSo they aren't just simple memes but much more part of a world view. \n\nIf you question elements of this world view, you are generally down voted. (That's OK if you think what the person is saying is not helpful to the conversation--downvotes are OK except as a method for silencing people. I don't want people to be silenced, whatever their views.)\n\nI sort of wonder if these more complex ideas become a kind of community value--so the down votes are because it feels like you are attacking the community--on reddit, we think *this way*...or at least on this part of reddit we think *this way.*  If you don't, then people may take that personally. \n\nI'm assuming the ideas are held by different subreddits and reddit communities and then spread outward.

        "text": "I don't think I need to make too lengthy of a post for the problems of Reddit comments in the defaults. One-liner jokes hitting the top, political circlejerks, casually accepted racism, factual inaccuracies, etc. etc. \n\nFirst off, I think I'm making a broader discussion here than just the \"official\" defaults or the \"popular\" subreddits. I respect some subs for being not as bad as other subs, with places like Ask Reddit managing, though much time and effort put into things, managing to be slightly less shitty than the others. And other Subreddits, like /r/midlyinteresting and /r/showerthoughts are designed around the concept of Reddit to begin with and such really can't be criticized here. \n\nI'm talking about the proverbial top level domains of Reddit. The common noun subreddits. The ones everyone rolls their eyes and groans at vocally when brought up. /r/funny, /r/random, /r/gifs, /r/technology, /r/news, /r/books, /r/worldnews, depending on who you ask /r/movies. They all tend to share similar problems, like low-effort or flat out bad OC reaching the top often, little good discussion, inaccurate facts getting pushed around, the absolute failure of moderation to effectively manage such large subreddits that draw such attention because of their domains. \n\nIn many ways all of Reddit suffers from these problems, though these subreddits in particular are a good case study. \n\nI think the real problem stems, unfortunately, directly from the core of Reddit's design, and not just the upvotes. See, the concept of Reddit is focused on the community curating content to have the \"cream\" of the content float to the top. Now with regards to what hits the frontpage this has lots of problems in and out of itself but I'll just focus on the comments, copypasting something I said in another topic here.\n\n&gt; The problem is that Reddit isn't a good platform for discussion. In 1v1 conversation maybe, but it can't really be a true discussion ever. The way Reddit is organized flat out ensures that most people will ever see one or two replies by one or two people to one comment/OP at a time without having to click \"more replies\" or scrolling down further, further cluttering up the CSS.\nNot to mention, Reddit's very topical. Popular posts after an hour or so get \"locked\", in the sense that new comments are just lost in the flood.\nOn smaller subreddits this can be migrated, since there tend to be only a few \"top level\" comments period, which allow for some form of discussion. But in places like the defaults, where there are hundreds upon hundreds of comments in an average somewhat popular topic, most comments are just drowned out for a while and pushed to the bottom, downvotes or not.\nSo only a few \"top level\" (read: comments not replies to existing comments) comments ever get looked at by most people who look at the topic, which results in a lot of system gaming, with things like quick, easy to digest information that can get a few precious upvotes fast enough to get to the top becoming far more popular, and comment replies becoming their own metagame in and out of itself, with 2nd opinion bias and comment chains prevailing over all.\n\nAs I wrote this, I began to realize how much it reminded me of Twitch chat. See, in popular streams it's impossible to say anything. Moments happen and are lost in seconds. There isn't any substantial punishment or reward for anything that's said, and everything that's said is almost immediately lost. This second-to-second focus is what results in that cesspool of rapidly fired dank memes and kappas that was the foundation for Twitch Plays Pokemon. \n\nReddit's like a migrated version of this. There is a lasting impact of things, but the only things that last are the things that are upvoted, the things that are rewarded, and the more upvotes something gets the more likely it is to get more upvotes. On one hand, this encourages good behavior, as shitty comments, at least in theory, should get quickly buried under the storm. The problem is, everything gets buried as well. Just posting a comment and leaving it there is in and out of itself a form of punishment for not making a post that's better suited to Reddit's own preferences, like not posting it sooner, or not making it easier to digest, or not tl;dr ing it. \n\nIt'd be like a party where your own voice was constantly being droned out by the constant noise of people, and you can't see anyone else apart from anyone because everyone's just in one big crowd. But people who are more popular suddenly get on a pedestal, with the more popularity a person gets corresponding to how high they get, and the higher they get the more noticed they are, and the more noticed they are the more popular they are and the higher they get.\n\nNow, everyone wants to be noticed. So how do you get yourself noticed? Arrive early to the party. Don't bore people with long roving discussions, because they might get bored and you can't engage as many people with it. Be accessible, say some quick jokes and one liners to get everyone to quickly fall in love with you. Maybe make a joke about something that happened earlier during the party, or at another party, in the hopes that maybe people from the last party will remember that happening and grow a bond with you, making yourself more popular. \n\nYou find people who are high, but not too high, and start talking with them. Since you're only talking with a few people here, the ones already elevated, you can get into deeper discussion, or maybe you go along with their joke and associate yourself with them, or maybe you try to undermine them and make yourself look better in the eyes of the people.\n\nThat's Reddit, and that's why a lot of the problems that Reddit has are really, really hard to solve.

        "text": "I first recognized this problem when I browsed /r/askscience.  Finishing up a PhD, I'd come across questions that I knew the answer to but what I would find was that top answers often were missing important information, moderators, or caveats, if they weren't completely wrong.  I'd sometimes try to correct the answer, but the effort was always futile and my comments were always buried.\n\nFurther, I've recognized that top askscience comments often get 1000s of upvotes, which is especially odd, when they sometimes deal with very specialized topics.  [Consider this question and answer from this week](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/39woqa/what_would_happen_to_me_and_everything_around_me/) which asks about the science of a nickle size blackhole and received over 7000 upvotes and was gilded 12 times.   What that suggests is that at least 7000 people upvoted the comment.  And yet, I would argue that only a small percentage have any real training in advanced cosmological physics to have any idea whether the answer is correct or not.  Instead, people read it, it sounds 'right' and subsequently upvoted it.  \n\nI'm not saying that particular comment is not correct, but I, nor virtually any other redditor, has anyway of knowing how factually accurate it is.  Indeed, there are a few dissenting opinions in the comments. And yet, most people would read it, see it has a lot of upvotes, and accept it as 'truth.' \n\nThis problem goes beyond science questions.  Indeed, often the top comment in any thread asserts something as a fact.  Often it takes the form of a critique of the post and I've seen many comments that state something along the lines of \"I always like to check the comments section to see why the article is wrong.\"  Implicit in a statement like that is that the top comment is true.  \n\nA few questions arise: How true are top comments? Should we accept the wisdom of the crowds and grant that they are, at least for the most part, correct? Redditors seem to be very critical of any form of external media but why do they seem to be accepting of highly upvoted comments? What motivates a redditor to upvote a comment that 'sounds' correct, but that they have no real knowledge on the true veracity?\n\nAs a final caveat, I am of course, speaking in generalities.  There are a few occasions where a top-level comment gets heavily criticized, but those seem more like exceptions that prove the rule.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\n\n\n",

I wonder how much of this is a demographic effect and how much is it being a well run sub (or some other factor I'm not thinking of)  \n* I did not expect that depression would be overly represented, and it is the biggest outlier, and demographics  *do not* seem explanatory, that was a big surprise  \n* most conditions have a clear sub associated, a couple notable exceptions are Avoidant Personality Disorder which impacts 5.2% of population but has not sub I could find, and Bi-Polar disorder which has two different subs (/r/bipolar and /r/bipolarreddit), are they rivals or something?  \n\nI'd be interested in anyone else's insights into this data.

        "text": "I don't understand why any subreddit continues to require NP links at this point for several reasons:\n\n1. The admins have commented a few times that NP isn't officially endorsed in any capacity, yet people seem to think it's an official requirement. This is only leading to confusion about \"proper\" linking until they finish whatever their official solution is that they're working on.\n\n2. Some subreddits use the NP CSS to make their subreddit completely unusable or obscure/reverse site features. Some subreddits now maintain a list of certain subreddits NOT to use NP when linking to which breeds confusion. People have made browser extensions to automatically remove the NP from any links to bypass this or simply disable custom CSS on subreddits that do so.\n\n3. Following an NP link will follow your session until you manually remove it in the address bar. If I follow an NP link, then click one of my subreddit links above the header, I stay in NP mode. I'll randomly then try to view the comments somewhere and the entire thing looks weird because of point 2. This isn't a good user experience.\n\n4. Many subreddits have automod configured to remove any reddit link that isn't NP. This is confusing for users outside the metasphere that don't understand what is going on. It is pointless on anything over 6 months old. It often doesn't serve a point on neutral (for lack of a better term) subreddits where a user may be just linking to a useful post for someone. \n\n5. A LOT of people believe that if you're browsing an NP link it is safe to vote freely because NP somehow prevents brigading and their votes don't really count. This is my biggest concern with the whole thing. I've seen people say that and get upvoted in this subreddit which one would think the readers have at least a somewhat better understanding of site functions than casual site users. I've asked a couple users that have stated this opinion why they bother to vote if they think it doesn't count and usually they say it's just habit or they use post voting to keep track of what they've looked at already.\n\nThe benefits as I see them currently:\n\n1. RES gives a quick popup reminder not to vote on NP. It is handy, but most people that bother to use RES likely know what NP links are intended for and that they shouldn't vote either way.\n\n2. Subreddits can make their pages unusable for NP viewers. This possibly stops a few users from absentmindedly voting but I don't see it having much impact on people that would follow links with the intention of voting.\n\n---\n\n\nAre there other pros or cons I'm not thinking of? Has anyone done analysis to determine what impact using NP links has had? If not, is there any way to do so without admin access to site data? For those involved in initially setting up the idea of using NP for linking, do you feel as though it has had the desired outcome?\n\nThis is often a politically charged subject on reddit. I'd like any replies to address NP linking as a whole and not any specific subreddit or user group unless relevent to display concrete data. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: It was pointed out that this discussion was covered two weeks ago so I'm deleting the post.",

Are the things /u/Semebay instructs the users to do and not do general guidelines that should be adopted by all \"meta\" subs?\n\nExample #2:  \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/39nwjh/meta_submitting_np_links_to_srs_is_now_banned/?\n\nSRS is no longer accepting np links.  np links were also discussed recently on [ToR](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/387ikg/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_that/?) among other places and threads.  So SRS bans np links, while SRD, BestOf, Circlebroke etc. require them, and ToR and the admins seem to think they are useless.\n\nWhat other things are in the mod toolbox that they can utilize to help?",

        "text": "\nThis is something that's been in the back of my mind for quite a while, but after spending so much time on the /r/all frontpage over the past two days, I've started to really question:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**How should one vote on /r/all?**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn deciding to write this post, I've discovered that it's actually quite difficult to understand how reddit wants me to vote. There isn't a lot of help upfront, and I actually had to do a few google searches to feel like I found everything. Even then, I knew what I was looking for -- where would a new user be?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette\n&gt;Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/wiki/voting\n&gt;On reddit your vote means, \"I found this interesting,\" not \"This should go on the front page,\" or \"I agree with this.\"\n\n&gt;Once registered, you can vote all links on reddit up or down based on whether you liked or disliked them [...]\n\n&gt;As a general rule, vote up what you liked (and want to see more of) and vote down what you disliked (and don't want to see similar things in the future) -- there's really not much else to it. [...]\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq : \"\\[...\\] let the voters decide?\"](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F)\n\n&gt;One issue that arises is that casual, new, or transient visitors to a particular community don't always know the rules that tie it together.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/2olykv/automoderators_flair_and_karma_have_been_wiped/cmoiz4j?context=3\n\n&gt;/u/Deimorz:\n\n&gt; Keep in mind these aren't \"official\" reasons or anything, but my own thoughts on why we don't have these:\n\n&gt;[...] if people just filtered out everything they didn't like, they'd no longer be downvoting those things, because they'd just never see them again. [...] This means that people that don't know filtering is an option (or that are logged out, which is the large majority of traffic) have to see all these \"bad\" posts that previously would have been downvoted\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis teaches me that:\n\n1. Everybody is allowed to vote on everything (if they found it naturally. We're not talking about brigades).\n2. One should vote based on whether the post contributes to conversation;\n3. whether the post is interesting;\n4. whether you want to see more of it (This seems to conflict with #2 unless you add a \"Well, ... \");\n5. and whether it was posted in the optimal subreddit.\n6. The posts and votes of casual, new, or transient users are often not in line with what the moderators of that sub are looking for.\n7. Users turning a blind eye to content they don't like can be considered negative for the other users, who now have to deal with content that should have been downvoted.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo what extent do these concepts apply to voting on /r/all? According to #3+4, I should be downvoting pretty much everything on the front page 24/7. However, if they were posted in the correct subreddit, do they technically deserve an upvote? With reddit, the rule is usually \"If you don't like it / don't want to see more of it, unsubscribe from that subreddit\". If I go to /r/all and see a bunch of shitposts, should I vote according to the rules above, or should I just leave and say \"I should have known what I was getting into\"? After all, everybody knows which subreddits dominate there.\n\nOn the front page, downvotes really don't mean much, but things start to get a little dirty if you're browsing /r/all/new. There are several subreddits whose content I will **never** find interesting or worthwhile. Does this mean I should downvote these posts as frequently as possible, or should I acknowledge that I am not a part of the community, and stop interfering with the content they clearly want to see? If I downvote 100% of posts that come out of a certain subreddit, could that be called tampering?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHow do you vote? How would you feel if [Filtered All](http://www.reddit.com/me/f/all) was a standard feature instead of gold-only? Are the guidelines in the FAQ and reddiquette archaic / unhelpful for what reddit has become?\n\nOf course, nobody is obligated to browse by /r/all in the first place. I know this post makes it sound like I take this way too seriously, but I'm actually a very infrequent voter, even on subreddits I like. I'm just curious what the general opinion is when it comes to voting on the front page and \"being the change you want to see\" in that regard.",

The results have now been published in a paper and I thought I'd share it here in case you may be interested. \n\nOur main argument is that decisions over what to up- or down-vote may be guided by evolved features of human cognition. The participant sample consisted of 489 redditors who rated the extent to which they felt different content traits influenced their voting. Statistical analyses showed that norm-following and prosociality, as well as various biases for emotional content and originality, were rated as important motivators of voting. Social influence (the existing number of votes) had a smaller effect than expected, and attitudes towards the submitter had little effect. \n\nHere is a link to the full paper:\n\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129703\n\nThanks again to those of you who participated in the study!\n\nedit:spelling",
