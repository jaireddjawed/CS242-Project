        "text": "Currently I am 21 years of age, average in everything and a male. I am unsure if this is a vent or me asking for advice. I have permanent diseases that seemingly are not as affecting me, but I rely on a tracheostomy tube to breathe properly. Due to me being born prematurely, I also had a lot of surgeries and more drastically diagnosed vocal chord paralysis. Growing up I was always in a clean house, never allowed to participate in sports and worse, always supervised by my \"family\" or my nurse. My diseases are respiratory, so I cannot run for distance or do very strenuous activities. I cannot swim, but I dream of it. I have never smoked or participated in narcotics/substances, but was surrounded by it due to family extensions or their lifestyles. I am the eldest child in the family and made more mistakes in my youth. \n\nMy mother, she is a head-strong woman with ambition. I don't see her as this. When I was a child, she was.. unavailable emotionally and mentally. Staying in an abusive relationship with my step-father. Even after pleading for her to leave and my uncles swearing that he'd be \"gone\" if they ever found my mother with bruises. She hid them. She didn't leave him until I was nearly 17 when I struck him for the first time. She saw what I was capable of if she hadn't put the fear of God in me in my younger years. I am trying to not think of the past whilst writing this. I don't hate my family, nor do I hate my mother. I feel surrounded by people who do not care. Maybe I was spoiled? Maybe I was starved of attention? Or maybe I was looking for the wrong type? One of my many mistakes was a wake up call. I started from the principal's office and finished at home with an unsupervised probation period. \n\nI deeply regret my actions I had done in my past. Nothing will ever fill the void of emptiness yet. While on probation, yes, I did have court-mandated therapy. I carried a lot of anger, now I do not carry as much. I wouldn't call therapy as effective for me because I was 16 and my mother coerced me to not speak of the violence I have seen which is attributed to my thought processes. Not even to mention that slowly my subconscious has allowed me to remember certain traumas buried in my mind, still lost in pieces. I don't feel love. I don't associate myself with \"love\" because I wasn't shown it. I am happy that I finished high school with my mother's permission. I only recently finished it. My younger siblings, they haven't experienced as much but they are more.. mature about it than I. They're not as emotional. Coming from me, a black guy, someone who is stereotypically supposed to withdraw emotions. I cannot. \n\nI am simply wondering, what is the next step? I feel as though my mother will not allow me to go to college by myself without supervision. I should like to, but even asking her, she says \"no\" boldly every time. It infuriates me. How can I be my own personal when she or any other members of my family are constantly watching me? I tried to show social boundaries firmly, but she says \"you're being disrespectful.\" I am thinking about getting a job and working from home or working some like a fast food restaurant, but I do not have a personal banking account nor do I have the knowledge of doing research extensively. It sounds as though I am making excuses, but it is only because I was coddled and never allowed to make my own choices fully by myself. I'm glad I was a juvenile because it showed me what future was possible if I allowed my anger to control me. I still let it drive me from time to time, but what I really need is not what my family wants me to do. Thank you for reading. Any and all criticisms are welcome. I desperately need advice as I do not want to continue to live with my family into my 30s or 40s.",

        "text": "Im 18 and going on 19 soon, at this moment I feel like I won't go anywhere in life I feel like I can't make any progress. I feel like I might be depressed but I just can't tell. I stay in my room pretty much all day every day still in school online, my mom watches TV by herself while I'm in my room all day and do school work and play video games, I do a workout now and then I do pretty well at one point eating a lot of food and nutrient drinks, I'm 114 pounds but I have a bit of fat on me. I feel like I could focus on myself if I didn't have school or video games, I think the main thing is school the constant work every day distracts me from what I want to do. I Don't have very good hygiene I don't brush my teeth every day I don't take a shower every day, and I'm really lazy as well I feel, I'm also very damn tired every day I feel like sleeping doesn't do anything for me, some nights I stay up until 6 am on school nights too.\n\nI feel very dead inside, I'm not a very happy person to talk to I don't even want to talk to someone only if they talk to me I respond with \"yea\" or \"okay\" most of the time or I just fake laugh sometimes. I don't go anywhere by myself I went to the DMV this week with my mom, and she asked \"could you do this on your own?\" I said I don't know they asked me a couple of questions about where I was born I almost couldn't think of it on the spot and what my mother's maiden name is I have no clue what that means I just said her last name but I guess its the family name, and also I'm a very slow talker and thinker, I just I feel like I have social anxiety only because I just don't know what to say to people like if I went to a doctors appointment by my self I wouldn't know any medications I'm taking, maybe 2 or 3 but I just feel like I'm lost in life. Very badly. \n\nI don't want to take my life to suicide, except one time I held a knife to my throat standing on the kitchen counter because I didn't get the toy or game I wanted and the police were there and talked me out of it. I don't like therapy at all it has never helped my mom wants me to keep going I tell her that I don't need it she doesn't listen. I just fucking hate the situation I'm in. ever since I was 13 I started being a lot less talkative, and my appetite changed I wasn't hungry very much. still, today I'm at the same weight as I was 3 years ago. \n\nAlso don't have any friends as of last august, I just stopped and ignored them because I don't want to tell them that I don't want to be friends anymore I think of it as if I said that to my family I would rather die than tell them \"I don't want to be friends anymore\" we were friends since 5th grade now I'm in 11th almost 12th. Also, I'm doing online school because I'm doing better online than I was in the past 3 years doing in-person school my mom was shocked. But I'm glad I'm at home I don't want to be in a school and see the people I use to be friends with and I don't want them to ask what happened it's been 5 months. I think having no friends has also had a major effect on how happy I was and now I'm not.\n\nI just feel like I'm in such a bad place that there's no way to fix it, the main thing I want to be able to do is to go out on my own but in this world now I feel like I would be killed out of nowhere, I used to not worry about all this when I was little because I didn't understand the world. \n\nalso, I don't like talking because I don't brush my teeth every day and I have n underbite and a crooked jaw my teeth are not aligned and I try not to show my teeth when I talk or smile I wish I could get teeth implants but it's my fault for it anyway, ever since I was little I hated brushing my teeth or any hygiene. I try and Make a list sometimes ill do this and that but I just never do anything i say ill improve on.\n\nI hope no one that knows me sees this or knows who I am just by reading this. I'm just going through a really bad roadblock in life and it seems to never and is getting worse slowly I just don't know what to do anymore.",

They exist for that reason. Guess why, though? because someone remained dedicated to those efforts long enough to obtain results. It isn't complicated science. It's not difficult.\n\nYOURSELF is the issue. neither a sound system nor a lack of information. There isn't a big idea that will enable you to become endlessly productive. It won't take place. Nothing is a trick. No tricks. There is nothing that will overnight alter your life.\n\nGet up every day and make a commitment to your goals, duties, plans, and ideas for your life. Each and every day. small by little. even if you think you're a loser. Do it now. It really is that easy. This won't be simple. In fact, it's VERY DIFFICULT. But it's not difficult. So easy.\n\nThere won't be anything else to save you. Leave Reddit and go to the gym. Perform a jumping jack. You would be better off if you did that each and every day than than reading another blog post about the \"morning habits of successful people.\"\n\nChoose the best piece of productivity advice you've ever read or heard, and follow it religiously for a month. 30 days. It will be challenging, but not impossible. Do not resist. Let me know if you require another system after that.\n\nPeople do not commit to all these different weight loss plans, which is why they exist. They give it a week's worth of effort, cheat on the program, and then give up when they don't notice any progress. They later attribute it to the program. Oh, what a waste of money weight watchers was. You did that for a week, yes. Money was wasted on it. People that are committed to it succeed with weight watchers. hundreds of thousands. I haven't even tried Weight Watchers, either.\n\nNever is the software, idea, tip, or trick the issue. YOURSELF is the issue. You don't require a different program. All you have to do is act. Once you've given this some thought, you might be able to start making some positive changes in your life.",

I came here tonight in seek of any guidance that could be provided to me from this well-reputed community. \n\n  I am 18 years old now and I have gone through late-childhood and adolescence completely incorrectly. Ever since I was 13yo my sleep and nutrition have been a mess. I would always stay up way past midnight or not sleep till the morning. I can't even recall a time where I slept before 11pm. I've been eating like shit, just all sorts of low quality chips and  sugary snacks. Sometimes I would barely even eat anything all day. I beleive It has all interfered with my growth. I feel incomplete. Im about 5'8 (172cm) but it doesn't feel right when I look at the proportions of my arms or torso. I'm not comfortable with my height In the slightest. My voice is also not that of an 18yo. Not one of Thr guys I know or see have this immature of a voice. My guess is that my foolishness had interfered with my testosterone production in my most crucial years for natural growth, thus my voice and height. Its true that its mostly genetics but its no lie that you can still either help yourself achieve more than your genetics can give you by doing all the right things, or do the opposite and have less by sabotaging the process. I have done the latter sadly.\n\n  On top of that my eyes are all damaged from countless nights of gaming / watching stuff in pitch darkness. Not any noticeable decrease in sight but the dark eyebags are definitely noticeable. Refused to remove my teeth as a kid when it was time for them to be changed because I was scared, so I ended up having crooked teeth and my dumbass breathing from my mouth for years on end made it much worse. \n\n  And this is just concerning my appearance. My mental health is in shambles. I'm a disappointment to anyone who might or might not love me. I will by no means give up on life or on my dreams and goals, but I'm in a bad place and the worst thing is that I could've prevented all this if I wasn't such an idiot. I could've helped myself and would've been in a better physical and mental state now.\n\n  I've never asked in any community or group for advice or help. But I couldn't sleep and years of bad habits and regret are weighing on me.\n\n  My apologies, this ended up longer than I intended. If you're still reading to this point I thank you and wish you the best. I will try as I may to turn things around in the 2 upcoming years, maybe I can still improve and grow after 18. If you have any advice or tips that might help me out it mean a lot to me to comment them.\n\n  Thank you.",

I’m ashamed to admit that I see many people as stupid at times instead of unique and special, even though I know they are unique and special. I am also very OCD and feel absolutely unable to relax. I always feel like I have to be doing something, learning something new, or working on tasks such as debt payment, chores, skills, etc. It’s gotten to the point where it is affecting my relationships and find it impossible to enjoy things that most people enjoy.

Since I was a young child, I could never talk to anyone in front of him, before he interrupted and changed the subject to what he wanted to talk about. I timed it many times and I would talk for 1 minute before he interrupted. Sometimes when in talking just to him, he'd interrupt with a question then just sit in silence, until you talked again. If I talk longer than a minute he complains that all I do is talk and wants me to be quiet. So that's what I did, I shut up and didn't talk around him unless we were fighting (he's the great antagonist). The only time I could talk to my mom was when he wasn't home or was asleep. A few years ago I couldn't even talk to her cause of Alzheimers, she began having concentration problems and doesn't realize you are talking to her, then her brain warps things into something else and she suddenly believes you are against her and gives you the silent treatment (something both parents have done to me and each other since I could talk). I also had/have no friends. I literally go days without talking or leaving my house, unless to work. \nNow here's my problem, when I finally get to talk, I can't stop. I don't want. I always ask people things about themselves, but I don't think that's enough. The other problem, all through elementary school we were taught, that when somebody says something you tell a similar story about yourself to show you can relate to them. I feel like I dominate the conversation and make things about me. I'm aware I do it, I'm definitely aware after I leave a conversation, so how do I train myself to have a conversation without butting in, making it about me, or dominating the conversation?",

Whenever I feel confident or when I just didn't sleep enough, I just speak what's on my mind without thinking very much about the consequences.\n\nThe thing is, it's often to say some unusual compliments, because sometimes when I notice something good about someone I just love saying it since it brings no harm and it can make the person's day better. Problem is, when it's with girls, they can quickly think I want to flirt when it's clearly not the case, I just say what's on my mind.\n\nFor exemple, today I ate with some girls from college that I know pretty well but not THAT well.\n\nMid-lunch I noticed one of them had contact lens that gave her big blue eyes. It fitted her well, so I told her \" Oh yeah if you think I would stop with compliments now that we know each other better, you ain't seen nothing yet. Your eyes... They are uh, how do I put it... Beautiful as fuck \"\n\nAfter I told that she just bursted out laughing with her friend and then thanked me, before saying that the way I formuled it was very weird though. I wanted to die.\n\nLater, I was speaking with her said Friend and I told her to remind me all the bullshit I told her when we talked together last night, since I was on the verge of falling asleep at anytime( Yeah, this evening I was also really honest for nothing ). She told me \" Well, you said that appearance counted more than you thought since you have fixed your glasses. And you also said that you really enjoyed to talk with me since it's a long time we did so \"\n\nI responded \" Oh yeah I remember now. You can forget the first part, I'm not a superficial dude at all, I have my principles about this. That being said, I always think I had a great fun talking to you again, that was really cool.\n\nShe chuckled without even looking at me and then said \" Thank you \". I wanted to die again, she probably thought I tried to flirt with her or some shit.\n\nAnyways, some help about this ? I try to think a little bit more before talking, but it's just too hard. I really love to tell what's on my heart, even if I must be seen as a weird Guy.",

        "text": "It's been an extremely difficult week at work. It's not like I judge everyone and dislike others and all that. When I appreciate someone, you can ask them and they'd say nobody's been so appreciative of them in all their lives. For example, I completely admire my manager who is extremely knowledgeable and also super humble. I love a junior in my team who comes from a remote village, is highly passionate, and is really a sweet person. I love this nerd engineer on my neighbouring team who is extremely skilled for their age. I love most people in my city because this is a calm, nice place mostly.\n\nBut when people irritate me repeatedly, again, you can ask them, and they'd tell you nobody would have been so confrontational to them ever. For example, there is this senior we all have to work with, who is making life hell for us, always saying yes to the clients' demands, no matter how unreasonable those demands are. We are exhausted as a team. In daily calls, all of us would just be sighing and dealing with issues the client brought up that day or the previous day. Last week, I contacted this person and gently reminded them to give my team mate the good feedback she totally deserves so that she might get a good raise, and this person said \"that's a good idea! how come that idea never occurred to me?\". But I could see this team mate of mine slaving everyday at work, so I felt she did deserve it. \n\nThis week, this person accepted another set of unreasonable demands from the client and I totally lost it. I tried explaining our position politely, gently on group calls, individual chats, by email, writing even a long email and all that ... Nothing works. Satisfying the client is this person's top or rather only priority. On today's call where we were debating over our perspectives, I couldn't wait for this project to get over, to completely stop interacting with this person. Talking to them felt impossible, like they don't change their stance; you simply don't feel heard. These clients are also overly demanding, not appreciative of us even once, extremely critical, perfectionistic, would never admit mistakes on their part, and just keep demanding and criticizing all the time. My team mates certainly deserve better!\n\nAfter a few hours, I realized that may be I'm just being very hard on this person and being highly judgmental of them and our clients. Maybe they are all just trying to do their jobs and what would help them earn a living and secure their jobs. IDK ... I surely don't want to have this rage in me against anyone, no matter how short-lived it is. I don't intend to become Buddha but I want to be at least neutral towards people and situations that frustrate me. Are there any books you would recommend?\n\n(Just in case someone might bring up the topic of \"mental health\", \"disorder\" and such, don't do that because I love being objective and knowing the truth, so I have seen many shrinks and therapists in the past and I have asked them all if I have mental health issues, and the conclusion was that there is nothing of that kind, that I am just stressed and frustrated.)",

The only way I found self-worth was to try to make everybody around me feel like they are important and cared for. I loved life with everything I had and lived relatively carefree (pretty irresponsibly, it has to be said). This worked until a car crash at 21 left me with depersonalization and the inability to connect with others or myself and basically almost a complete lack of feeling or empathy for years which led to a LOT of self hatred. Lost most of my friends, my family showed intermittent worry but mostly appeared uneasy around me, also lost the ability to laugh. I felt entirely dead inside and this showed in my eyes, as en ex girlfriend told me (and somehow, I felt). Anyway, I feel more these days, but it is rarely anything other than fear or sadness, and everything feels insurmountable. \n\nI am almost entirely alone, dont enjoy anything, I feel apathetic, have no real friends and am so fearful and untrustworthy of people that I freeze them out or act oddly and they leave.

There are the basics that I shouldn’t have to mention like taking regular showers, brushing your teeth, getting regular hair cuts, trimming your beard, clipping your fingernails and using deodorant. These should be done anyways so I won’t go into anymore detail. But there are also some more areas that will make you better-looking in the long-term.\n\n**Fashion**\n\nI’m not suggesting to buy the trendy clothes every season but to buy clothes that are timeless and fit well. Invest money — over time — to assemble a wardrobe where you have five or six outfits that go together and make you feel confident.\n\nTo be honest I don’t know a whole lot about fashion other than this but it works and again, if your clothes are clean, go together and fit you can’t do much wrong.\n\n**Body**\n\nGet into the gym. Whether you are skinny, fat or worse, skinny-fat, workout regularly. If that’s in the gym or outside doesn’t matter. What matters in my opinion is that you do some kind of resistance training. Be that with weights or calisthenics. Build some muscle and lose fat. Couple that with a healthy diet and you’re good. (By healthy I mean lots of vegetables and other high quality foods that have big nutritional values.)\n\nYour body shows how disciplined you are and that you live a healthy lifestyle. As soon as you start seeing results you’ll be motivated to continue and proud of the progress you made. This will give you confidence and make you carry yourself differently, hence better body language. This will also make you appear better looking.\n\n**Set and achieve goals**\n\nThis doesn’t have anything to do with how look on the first glance but I noticed that ever since I started setting monthly goals for myself my confidence improved and the energy I radiate. I don’t mean to sound like some spiritual guru or something, it’s just that my vibe has changed since I started setting and achieving goals.\n\nThese don’t have to be huge and life-changing. For example, I set some milestones in the gym I want to conquer, social situations I want to put myself into, and things I do for work as my goals. And every time I achieve something I actually get a sense of accomplishment which translates into confidence.\n\nIf you manage to improve all these and get the basics right you’ll start to literally see a difference in how you look, and not just in the short-term.",

        "text": "Everyone wants to win, but the truth is that it’s not always possible. Instead of focusing on winning, we should focus on finding solutions and making progress. This shift in mindset can help us become more productive and successful in our endeavors.\n\nChanging your mindset from winning to solution-focused thinking requires a shift in perspective. It means taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture instead of focusing on the immediate outcome. It also requires us to be open-minded and willing to explore different options and strategies that can lead us toward success.\n\n# What is Solution-Focused Thinking and Why is it Important?\n\nSolution-focused thinking is a problem-solving approach that focuses on finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems. This approach encourages people to think creatively, stay positive, and look for opportunities for growth and improvement. This mindset shift is significant because it helps people to approach challenges with a positive and proactive attitude, which in turn leads to more effective problem-solving and better outcomes.\n\n# 3 Steps to Shifting Your Mindset from Winning to Solutions\n\n1. **Practice Empathy:** Try to understand and see things from others’ perspectives. This can help you find common ground and focus on finding solutions that benefit everyone involved.\n2. **Reframe Your Thinking:** Instead of thinking of situations as win-lose, try to see them as opportunities for collaboration and problem-solving. This shift in perspective can help you see that finding solutions is more meaningful than being right or winning.\n3. **Focus on Your Values:** Think about what’s most critical to you in a situation, and use that as your guide for decision-making. When you stay true to your values, you’re less likely to get caught up in the need to win.\n\n# The Benefits of Solution-Focused Thinking and How it Can Help You Achieve Success\n\nSolution-focused thinking has a number of benefits, including:\n\n1. **Better Problem-Solving:** When you focus on solutions, you’re more likely to find effective and creative solutions to problems.\n2. **Improved Relationships:** When you approach problems with a positive and proactive attitude, it helps to build trust and strengthen relationships with others.\n3. **Increased Confidence:** When you focus on solutions, you become more confident in your ability to tackle challenges and find success.\n4. **Reduced Stress:** When you approach problems with a solution-focused mindset, you’re less likely to feel stressed and overwhelmed by challenges.\n\n# How To Develop a Problem-Solving Mindset &amp; Focus on Solutions Rather Than Winning\n\n1. **Listen Actively:** Make an effort to listen to others and learn from their perspectives. Ask questions and try to understand the reasons behind their views. When you understand others, you can work together to find solutions that meet everyone’s needs.\n2. **Let Go of the Need to be Right:** Be open to new ideas and be willing to consider different perspectives. Don’t get stuck in the belief that your way is the only way. Being open to various ideas can help you find better solutions and make everyone feel heard.\n3. **Practice Gratitude:** Focusing on what you’re grateful for can help you stay positive and maintain a solution-focused mindset.\n\n# Conclusion: Take Action Now &amp; Start Focusing on Solutions Rather Than Winning\n\nSolution-focused thinking is a powerful tool for problem-solving and success. By shifting your mindset from winning to solutions, you’ll be able to tackle challenges with a positive and proactive attitude, improve your relationships, and achieve success.\n\n So take action now and start focusing on solutions rather than winning. With time and practice, you’ll see the benefits of this mindset shift and become a more confident and effective problem-solver.",

You cannot rely on motivation to keep pushing you towards your goals, you have to remain consistent.\n\nIn order for us to make a lasting impact on our brains, we have to be consistent.

Here are some tips to remain consistent:\n\n☑️ Track yourself! Come up with a reinforcing way to keep track of your progress. Watching yourself improve can help to increase motivation to show up on days that feel hard.\n\n☑️ Reward yourself! Provide yourself with rewards contingent on you showing up. Celebrate those little wins! It'll activate your brain's reward system and help to fight that inner critic.\n\n☑️ Set small and achievable goals! Do not set yourself up for burnout, reach for goals that are within your capabilities. Don't shoot for the stars right away, remaining consistent might mean showing up once a week until you feel confident enough to increase it.",

From June 21’ to June 2022, I worked a job that was not very stressful, started to get routines down, went to gym and was making awesome strength progress 5/7 days a week majority of weeks, started sleeping 7-8 hours a night, was at the peak of my physical and mental health. Enter June 2022, transferred job locations one hour away because I was seeking more rounded experience of my business and needed change as I was starting to get complacent and bored with my position despite all of the above. Slowly but surely, my body, mind, and routine started to collapse. The workplace I am at is notorious for its TOXIC culture and I found out first hand. The nature of my job is already very intense and stressful and adding the drive and increase from 40 to 50-60+ hours a week not including extra 8 hours of driving. I slipped on everything I had built up before. Sleep gone. Gym if I was lucky 3 times a week. Off days I’d sleep until 3pm as I was drained from cramming 60 hours+driving into 4 days. Promoted in October and compounded my already high stress and ate much less resulting in losing 20lbs from the time I got there. I have leaned more heavily into my vices because of my lack of motivation to do anything besides work. \n\nPresent:\nNew opportunity I am taking that allows great compensation, ultimate freedom (work remote from my house for small business, make my own schedule and hours). Basically I have a chance to gain my life back. Met some lifelong friends and gained good experience but tore my structure down.\n\nMy question:\nHow do I tackle what I’m trying to reestablish the smartest way possible? I have been in a massive rut and do not want my current lifestyle to continue beyond this upcoming Spring. I say spring because I know the process takes time and I won’t magically be better in a week and that this will take patience and self discipline. \nDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions going forward. My new career will begin end of Feb. I really do appreciate any help y’all can give as I enter a new chapter of my life!",

So that means that if you get in a car accident and you become traumatized physically, and the pain is too big for your system to integrate, then you will probably have memory loss after that car accident.\n\nOr if something else happens to you physically that is just so painful that it's too much, then you won't remember it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in the same way when something happens to you that is emotionally too painful, you remember it, and that's actually a good thing because if you get, god forbid, raped or abused in some way in your childhood, for example, by a family member or whatever it may be, maybe it's not like a physical direct abuse, but it's more like lack of attention, chronically lack of love, chronically, anything like that could accumulate into something that is too painful for a child to actually realize.\n\nAnd why is that? Well, you know, if a child doesn't get attention for one day, it's not that bad.\n\nBut if he doesn't, if he doesn't get attention all the time, then at some point he's gonna have to realize I'm never gonna get the attention that I need in order to develop myself in order to grow up.\n\nAnd basically what that means is my parents just don't love me enough and they will never be there for me in the way that I need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that realization is incredibly emotionally painful, and that's something that the child will never be consciously aware of.\n\nBoth the emotional pain that is too devastating to be able to cope with.\n\nAnd physical pain that is too devastating to be able to cope with causes memory loss.\n\nWhat that actually means is that even though you do remember it at some level your system remembers, your consciousness doesn't remember.\n\nSo at the level that you were thinking, you don't, you, you can't recall it consciously, basically you don't know that it happened to you or you don't know what it was like, or you know, the event, but not what it felt like.\n\nAnd they remember some things that happened to them that probably weren't so nice, but they think, well, it's fine.\n\nI don't really remember any pain from that.\n\nYeah, that's because the outward effect is memory loss.\n\nBut what it actually means is the memory is still there, but it's been shut off.\n\nIt's been gated.\n\nAnd so this has been done by the repressive system.\n\nSo I want to introduce the concept of the repression system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the system in your body is comprised of several functions, but what it is responsible for is to shield your consciousness, your active awareness from pain that is too hard to deal with and would actually be dangerous to deal with.\n\nSo this could be physical pain or emotional pain.\n\nAnd it's actually good because too much pain is dangerous.\n\nLike it can actually, too much pain can cause you, your psyche to disintegrate.\n\nIt can cause you to to go crazy or it can actually cause death.\n\nSo this is not a joke.\n\nIt's not like you shouldn't have had this impact of this, this particular pain being blocked out.\n\nNow you should have had it blocked out because if you hadn't had it blocked out, you could have died.\n\nIt could have been really dangerous.\n\nSo it's there for a reason, but what this is, it means is now it becomes a trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA trauma is when pain was too big to feel, and then it gets blocked.\n\nAnd very simply put, that's what a trauma is.\n\nAnd when it gets blocked, it means that it's still there, but you can't access it, therefore it is stuck.\n\nSo when a tr when a pain is stuck, it's still bothering you, it's still causing mayhem in the body and in the psyche, but you're not aware of it.\n\nThere's gates in the brain that are able to block different levels of consciousness from each other.\n\nAnd I'll quickly draw for you how that works.\n\nSo I've talked about the different levels of the human psyche before, very simply, it's thinking, feeling, sensing and thinking is, is pretty con is pretty obvious.\n\nIt's, it's your conscious and awareness and what you think and what you believe and what basically everything that goes on your stories that you have in your head and the voice that you have in your head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that is called the third line, or that's basically the thinking level.\n\nThen below that, there's the feeling level.\n\nAnd by feeling, I mean emotional feeling.\n\nSo here, here's where all the anger and the sadness and the joy and the love and the feelings, the emotional feelings live deeper than that though is the reptile brain.\n\nReptiles famously don't have emotions, but they can feel, they can feel physical things.\n\nThey can sense all the sensations that come with having a body internal digestive tract, lungs, heart, et cetera.\n\nAnd also external, just like maintaining.\n\nIt's maintaining the status of everything that happens inside the body, inside the physical.\n\nAnd therefore it can have states such as terror and fight or flight.\n\nBut this is as deep as it goes.\n\nAnd this level also develops a lot earlier than the feeling system develops.\n\nThe feeling system only starts to mature as a child is five to six months old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when it starts to develop simple emotions.\n\nBefore that it's only pain or no pain in deadly trouble, or not inly trouble fight or flights terror or we're good.\n\nIt's, it's very, very simplistic.\n\nAnd that's what what the reptile brain is responsible for.\n\nAnd that is the sensing system.\n\nSo basically we have three levels.\n\nIt's thinking, feeling, and sensing.\n\nSo what happens when a catastrophic impact is made on one of these levels that the other levels probably couldn't deal with? That's when they get are activated.\n\nSo if you have a car accident or someone tortures you or something really bad happens that causes a lot of physical pain, you're sensing system might take the impact, take a lot of pain, and this would immediately activate the gates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I've illustrated that you would basically have an enormous pain at the sensing level, but when your system, your body recognizes this pain is going to be too big, this is a huge problem, we might self-destruct.\n\nIf we let this into our full awareness, then the gates will be activated.\n\nSo basically the pain from the sensing level is trying to come up to be experienced.\n\nAnd if you would be able to experience it safely, then you would move through it and there would not be a trauma created.\n\nBut because it's too much, your system detects we cannot move through this and we need to block this.\n\nAnd then the gates activate.\n\nSo the gates are basically neurons that are constantly sending inhibitory signals and block the communication between these levels.\n\nSo this is basically blocked.\n\nThis means that your emotional system doesn't know what actually the big sensory pain was or has been.\n\nThis, it starts when this pain is inflicted, but then it continues.\n\nAnd then your, your system is always working, constantly sending these like sh sh sh sh sh, sh, sh, sh, sh shushing signals.\n\nBasically.\n\nIt's exhausting to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd, and that's basically how you live your life from there on onwards until you basically do something like EMDR or another kind of therapy that deals with the trauma like primal therapy or regression therapy or, or emdr, anything that would basically address this level and, and dig out this pain dig out this experience.\n\nUntil you do that, you're blissfully unaware that there has ever been this level of pain.\n\nAnd you're always, these neurons are always firing these, these shh signals.\n\nShut up, shut up, shut up.\n\nWe don't wanna know.\n\nSo your, your emotions are not aware and also your thinking is not aware of how painful that was.\n\nNow, when something happens that is emotionally very painful, same thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically say your parents divorce or something like that, and you're like five years old, you don't know how to deal with it.\n\nYou feel completely, you feel very unsafe.\n\nLike no one's going to take care of you and, and you're basically on your own.\n\nAnd this is too much to deal with.\n\nThis is as, as this is happening, this is going to mess with your thinking too much.\n\nYou will basically go nuts or or die.\n\nSo that means that the gates are activated and also here on this level the disconnection is then made between the thinking level and the feeling level, which means that this giant ball of pain of like, I'm unsafe.\n\nMy parents can't even take care of themselves or make a harmonious home for me because they're constantly fighting with each other and splitting up.\n\nI'm all alone, blah, blah, blah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's too painful.\n\nThe gates are activated.\n\nThey're constantly shushing this pain and creating a, a disconnect between the thinking level and the feeling level.\n\nAnd this is how you get people that can say that they're fine and believe that they're fine.\n\nAnd emotionally they're absolutely not fine.\n\nThey have a lot of tension in their body, for example.\n\nAnd they might, might be very jumpy and overreact to a lot of things and get easily triggered and, but they think that they're fine and they don't really know what they're feeling.\n\nSo they think they're fine, but the reason that they don't know what they're feeling is because the gates are active.\n\nOkay? So that's one part of the repression system.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because this takes a lot of energy.\n\nThis takes a lot of energy.\n\nSo one drawback basically is that it's just a stress on your body to constantly have these gates activated.\n\nYou have to see this as like a huge electrical charge trying to discharge.\n\nAnd then to counteract that, the body has to, the brain has to constantly fire signals at, at that.\n\nSo it, it's costing you a lot of electrical energy literally to suppress that pain.\n\nBut that's not all that the regression system does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it has gates, but it also has endorphins.\n\nIt also has endorphins.\n\nSo endorphins are your internal painkillers.\n\nThey're much stronger than you could actually externally take.\n\nSo your endorphins that your body is able to produce, and these are the feel good, feel good chemicals that you also feel when you might go for a run for like an hour.\n\nOr you might go for a walk for like two, two or three hours.\n\nYou feel this great endorphin rush.\n\nAnd this is the substance that your body produces, that interacts with the op receptors.\n\nDoes the same thing with heroin, morphine other op opiate drugs who do, it's a very potent internally produced painkiller.\n\nSo it's a very potent internally produced painkiller.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd it's fine to enjoy that after you've had a run or you've had a walk or you've had some sort of exercise that also helps to feel not completely broken after exercise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what's wrong with that? There's gating.\n\nSo I don't know that I've been hurt and I don't know that that pain is still there.\n\nGreat, yeah, it costs a bit of energy, but you know, I, I've got energy, who cares? You might say, well actually gates is not enough.\n\nBecause if you just had the gating, then you're not aware that you've been hurt, you're not aware that you have a physical or an emotional trauma, but your body still very much is in pain even though you don't know what's going on.\n\nAnd therefore you also need the endorphins.\n\nYou also need the painkillers to be elevated constantly.\n\nThese endorphin levels are chronically elevated, which would be great, and it allows you to go through life's thinking.\n\nNo, nothing bad happened to you and you're fine.\n\nHowever, endorphins are proven to mess with the immune system.\n\nThat is a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo endorphins, the impair the production of different cells that immune system uses to break breakdown malignant cells, detect diseases and and whatnot.\n\nIt impairs the production of certain immune system cells and it also messes with their function.\n\nIt confuses the immune system.\n\nLiterally the immune system is very complex and every day it's fighting cancer cells, cleaning up dirt, it's cleaning up old cells and it's cleaning up garbage that from your digestive system.\n\nAnd it's cleaning up cancer cells that you are basically producing every day.\n\nAnd if it stops cleaning up cancer cells, you get cancer.\n\nAnd if it gets confused about what things to fight, it might fight parts of your own body.\n\nAnd that's how you get autoimmune disorders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to recap, if you've got trauma, be it physical or emotional, that means at some point the pain level was so high that you couldn't deal with it and you had to block it out.\n\nAnd that pain is still with you.\n\nThat pain, you're still carrying that pain, blissfully unaware that it is ever was ever there.\n\nThen your body's working all the time to keep you blissfully unaware that it was ever there.\n\nAnd part of that work means raising the levels of endorphin in the blood so that your level of feel-good chemicals has to be higher than a more mental healthy person to feel normal.\n\nAnd with that chronically elevated endorphin level, the immune system is suppressed.\n\nAnd over time, after years and years, it starts working less and less well, it starts getting more and more confused.\n\nEventually some cancer cells get undetected or eventually the immune system starts getting confused about what's mine and not mine and it starts fighting itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has also been very well described in the book \"When the body says no\", that's basically why you get sick eventually after you suffer trauma.\n\nSo yes, it is actually dangerous to not deal with your trauma.\n\nSo whether it's trauma that you incurred in a singular event or trauma that you basically have from childhood, from lacking certain types of care and love and attention from parents, you probably, if that's the case, you're probably not even aware of it or maybe you have some sort of vague memories that seem like if you think about them, yeah, maybe a child wouldn't have liked that so much.\n\nBut I don't remember it being very painful and I don't understand why I'm having such neurotic thoughts or habits or weird ticks all the time or whatever it may be, or why I'm depressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe it a car accident, a war or an imperfect childhood that you don't remember parts from.\n\nIf you don't deal with it, you risk your chance of getting cancer or auto autoimmune disorders and this is why.\n\nSo I hope that inspired you to take another look at your childhood and if there's hints of things that you don't remember so well, or if you have other reasons to be, believe that you were neurotic and you might have some childhood trauma, deal with it because it also massively impact your physical health.\n\nSo thank you for reading.",

I devoted a considerable amount of time to crafting a strategy for achieving my goals, utilizing online tools to keep track of my tasks and document my progress.\n\nWith a keen eye on my financial future, I turned to an app to manage my savings, hoping to increase my net worth by $10,000 by the end of the 100-day journey. I also devoted my energy to starting a side-hustle, leveraging my past experience as a co-founder of two different ventures to drive success.\n\nWith domain names secured for two new websites, one for consulting services and another for affiliate marketing based on my hobbies, I reached out to friends for assistance and made arrangements to keep things moving smoothly, even during times of great stress. Data rooms, accounting systems, and well-defined business processes are in the works, and I plan to start small with the consulting services, offering basic yet crucial services such as pitch deck creation, data room organization, business plan writing, grant writing, market analysis, etc. for those who are starting their own ventures or new projects. \n\nAs for my affiliate marketing endeavors, I plan to tap into my hobbies and offer recommendations for products and services that I have personally used and enjoyed.\n\nOverall, I would rate my first day of the challenge a 7 out of 10, having accomplished some tasks to a great degree while falling short in others.\n\nAs I mentioned in my post concerning Day 0, my goals do not need to be universally successful, for they serve as an indicator of where I stand versus where I wish to be. But I am an incurable perfectionist, which can be both a blessing and a curse. \n\nTo 99 more days.",

        "text": "It may appear simple, but when I realized it, it greatly aided me. I'll do my best to share it.\n\nMany productivity issues stem from being constantly overstimulated.\n\nPeople frequently say, \"I did nothing all day instead of working,\" but the truth is that you did nothing. You were constantly stimulating your brain by using social media or something else.\n\nThe message to your brain is straightforward: I can lay all day and still be stimulated. And THIS is why you want to lay down in bed. It's a low-cost method of stimulating your brain. Your brain despises inaction.\n\nTry sitting somewhere and doing nothing for an hour or two. Place your phone next to you and stare at it.\n\nYou will quickly notice that your brain begins to negotiate with your stimulation conditions.\n\nAt first, it'll just tell \"come on, let's just check Twitter\". Then it will begin to reduce its requirements, and you will begin to feel as if you are on drugs. You'll want to sing a song, dance, or do something else. This is crucial.\n\nWhen I feel the urge to procrastinate, I try to look at it from a different angle.\n\nInstead of fighting with my brain over 'do it now' vs. 'do it later,' I've told myself, 'Ok, Brain, we don't have to do it now. We could sit here all day and not even get started. BUT we're not going to do anything else.'\n\nThis is what began to help me.\n\nWith time, I've realized that it's difficult to do NOTHING when the brain is stubborn for a long time, such as when you have to wash your dishes, etc. This is fine, but do something that does not stimulate you. (Washing my dishes without music, for example, is not stimulating for me).\n\nWhat I've also noticed is how harmful 'infotainment' can be to your health. You lay in bed and browse some 'nice websites'. You're learning a lot about math, space, and productivity from YouTube, and you may believe it's far superior to social media. But, in reality, it's the same problem: you're giving yourself an easy way to be stimulated while failing to do what you should be doing.",

The thing is, my country is a bit socially underdeveloped, so friend groups are as clear as water, and my reputation is a bit bad so girl groups reject me, (they’re gradually accepting me), but i’ve hit a standstill, generally.\n\nHow do I socialize? I’m in my final year of highschool, and I want to get ready for university, but my social skills are so underdeveloped right now. The only people I can talk to are some girls who approached me prior or my nerd friend group (btw they’re racist and love saying the n word). And that’s also because I know them.\n\nBut now that I’ve become more mindful, i do not know how to socialize with anyone. Being aware of myself made me unable to start conversations naturally. I don’t want to be limited to what I like only. I want to know other people, and generally just talk to people in all types of friend groups. I tend to act like a weirdo to make others laugh but the cringe memories will only pile up. Also I will have no friends in uni at this rate.\n\nWhat do I do? What should I learn? What?",

        "text": "So I wrote about five books when I was a teenager, and even though words wouldn't come out so effortlessly every day, I did manage to write quite a lot.  I unsuccessfully published my stuff on Wattpad and a personal blog (in Portuguese), besides sending short stories for publication in English magazines, unsuccessfully too. Eventually, I realized that my desire to be discovered was as big as my desire to express myself. Now, I know you should write for yourself without worrying too much about publication or popularity, but that's how it always worked for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the years went by (I'll turn 24 soon), I just went out of fuel. I started dozens of projects during the past few years and never got much further than a few pages in. If I'm lucky, I'll finish at least one short story per year. In fact, I spend most of my time thinking about writing without actually writing, because once I open the text editor, I can't feel that fire anymore, and this makes me wonder if I actually want to be a writer or if it was all just another obsession of my teenage years that I wasn't able to let go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, I do feel like I *have* things to write or emotions I want to feel, but eventually, I realize that those emotions are attached to a movie I watched or a book that I read, and I think that if I want to feel those things, maybe I should go and just watch that movie or read that book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I just made this thing of \"being a writer\" a much bigger part of who I am than I should've done, and now I'm left with an identity crisis every time I try to quit as if I'm losing my essence or I'm not *deep* enough as a person. Does that make sense?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I think that common advice, such as \"just push through\", doesn't work for me because I've been feeling this agony for YEARS now, and even my therapist and anxiety medication couldn't bring me out of this hole that I dug for myself.",

        "text": "This school year has been really difficult for me. I’m 16 and it’s my senior year of high school and this is the most depressed I have ever been in my life. I feel like I’m in a rut, I don’t want to get up from bed and all I want to do is stay on my phone. I now study for my tests just an hour before. My parents have become more and more abusive and my grades are dropping, I used to be a straight A student but not anymore.\n\nMy parents are pressuring me about college as well and making me stressed and they want me to do medicine which I don’t want to do as well. From all the stress, I missed a few colleges application deadlines which made my parents very angry. I’m also sad that I missed the college deadline applications and my parents are making everything worse. My older sisters who I used to think I could rely on for support have also started criticizing me and making fun of me as if they’re also my parents. I’m always breaking into tears randomly everyday, even in school.\n\nThe worst thing is that a month ago, during a math test, the teacher accused me of cheating because the girl in front of me looked behind her to look at my test paper. The teacher saw this and accused me of tapping her shoulders so she can look back??? He took my test paper and gave me an immediate 0 on the test. The entire class saw this and I was so embarrassed. After the test, the class knew that he was being unfair so a few girls in the class including the girl who was in front of me came with me to convince him to let me redo the test but he didn’t budge. The teacher said that the girl in front of me would never cheat while I’m the type of person to cheat. The girl got off with no penalty even though she was the one who looked back and I got a 0 on a test worth 35% of my grades. The teacher is kind of a pedophile so he probably did this because the other girl is known as the pretty popular girl while I’m a total loser.\n\nThe teacher sent an email about the cheating to my parents and added a few extra made up details to make it worse and my life has been hell ever since. This was quite literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me. My mom beat me up everyday straight for a week. And she still screams at me everyday. She also took my phone for a while and is now extra strict on me and tells me to study every minute of every day.\n\nMy mom being very abusive is something that I’m used to, so the worst thing is that when it all happened a month ago, my dad has literally not uttered a single word to me since. He completely ignores my existence and I’ve started to try to avoid seeing him in the house. My dad and I used to be close, a week before the math test, he even took me out for lunch and ice cream and bought me a new bag. I’ve ruined my relationship with my parents and now my dad has a very bad image of me in his head. \n\nI’ve tried begging the teacher and the principal in the school to change my grade. I tried explaining to my teacher what happened but he was stubborn and mean. I even embarrassed myself by crying to him but nothing changed. \n\nI don’t have any friends in school, it’s always been like this, my mom knows and calls me a weird loser. She asks me what’s so wrong with me that nobody wants to talk me, she compares me to her friends’ daughters. Everybody ignores me when I talk. I don’t have any hobbies except for staying on my phone. I don’t have any real personality traits. I don’t have a life. The only good thing about me used to be my good grades but not anymore. Now my dad doesn’t even talk to me. I’m so alone in life, everyone else in school has friends, they say good things about their parents, they laugh and have fun in school, they have hangouts after school, why not me as well? How did my life turn out this way? I want to be happy as well. What can I do? I hate myself so much, maybe I should have done something when the girl looked back at me during the test, maybe I could’ve begged better. I’m such a loser. I want good things to happen to me as well, I want people to be kind to me.",

It’s a femoral neck fracture in my right hip now. I tried my best to tell the people around me, but wolves can’t cry wolf. I’ve always just tuffed it out, and gritted my teeth to keep going. Todays my first day of resting completely, and I’m a very active person so I’m not quite sure what I’m supposed to do. It’s not even 5am and I’ve already done an upper body workout, and I got a long day ahead of me. I’m new to using Reddit, and I think this can be a great place to vent the stress of this. I train martial arts at the house, and I’ve been biting my tongue for months now and working my ass off at the same time. My two week notices has been over for about 3 weeks, but this stress fracture in my hip will take 3-6 months to heal itself. Stress can kill, and I’m fighting back. I’ve been depressed and anxious as ever, and even having suicidal thoughts. I refuse to ever put my family through the pain of finding me dead, or anything like that. The thought of it breaks my heart to begin with. I’ll be fine, and I think my friends and family understand that. I’ve had an attempt that I tried to take the easy way out. That was back in April 2019, and it was a toxic ex girlfriend who mentally tortured me. I’m a good guy, but that gets your stomped all over. I can’t let another female have control of my emotions like that ever again. I have more self control than most 19 year olds do, and training on the heavy bag has been my therapy. I can’t do that anymore or atleast till April at the earliest. I’m gonna go eat some breakfast, but thank you to this community for allowing me to get this off my chest.",

I've been working for my current company for about 6 months now, and I don't want all the time and effort I've put into building good relations with my co-workers and managers to go to waste. For once, I actually feel like I fit in at work and can be myself. the job itself isn't all the challenging. I'm just an assembler. It can be repetitive, but there's enough autonomy and variety to keep me satisfied. They were small when I started with them. They only had 5 employees, and now they've hired another 5 people. I like the small business mentality. Theres less drama, less work place politics and no stupid policies or red tape you have to watch out for. I feel like I can just go to work and do what I have to do and go home. The only thing that bothers me is it doesn't pay enough. I know if I stay in this job for the long run, if I don't get a raise, I will not reach my financial goals. I have one part of me saying to stay where I am. I enjoy the job, so I can spend the remainder of my time and energy on exploring side hustles and other hobbies. And the other part of me is telling me to be more career oriented. I don't want to get to a certain age and think, \"shit, I wish I took that opportunity\". Theres nothing worse than living in regret. But I think my fear of failure and taking what I have now for granted is what's holding back. There is also nothing worse than going for another job, just for the money and finding out that you hate it. God, I don't know what to do.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10ymhcy/game_as_a_methodology_of_experience_formation/",
        "text": "  \n\n## Game as a methodology of experience formation\n\nGame is one of the key elements of human culture. Let us consider its business-educational aspects.\n\nThe first important consideration in using game as a tool for experience transfer is its natural causation. We do not intentionally engage the psyche, but initiate fundamental mental processes and individual's need for personal growth, self-actualization and self-determination. By applying business games, it is possible to multiply and intensify the educational load.\n\nThe second important consideration is the entertainment and recreational nature of the impact. The process of the business game in and of itself is recreation after the main social activity.\n\nThe educational objectives of business games are as follows:\n\n· Cognition of facts;\n\n· The ability to make decisions upon events that don't happen often or won't happen in practice;\n\n· Creating a super-intensive flow of events that do not exist outside of game situations and providing opportunities to react on them;\n\n· Developing group interaction skill within the various social roles presented in the game;\n\n· Involuntary memorization of proper behavioral patterns and methods of solution of various social problems, in which participants do not find themselves due to their age or social stratum.\n\n### Psycholinguistic approach as a tool for understanding and solving business problems\n\nOne of the postulates of psycholinguistics states that awareness of the world occurs through words and structural language components. We can only perceive those things that are defined by words, and perform actions with them that can be expressed in words. This is to say that in many respects we are in thrall to the language we use.\n\nBusiness owners often do not acknowledge problems since they are unaware of the necessary definition and, as a consequence, are unable to perceive and identify this phenomenon in essence. Therefore, any solution should begin with defining the phenomenon and developing the ability to verbally use these words. Social psychology offers no other opportunities. To reinforce a skill and form stable neural connections, it is necessary to repeat much the same frequently. Repetition is represented by the need to create a structure of a business game so that it does not become boring for the participants.\n\n## Drama as a tool of emotional impact\n\nIn order to increase the significance and value of the developed linguistic structural components for participants, it is necessary to fulfill the condition of emotional coloring of the game. For this purpose, the game role should be placed in a dramatic situation to provide thrills. The participants should have the feeling that the situation is challenging and his/her performance can influence further events.\n\n**Georges Polti proposed a** **descriptive list \"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations\", and when preparing the business game, it is advisable to choose one of the proposed situations rather than reinvent the wheel.**\n\n## Results of applying the approach\n\nThe use of role-playing business games as a tool for creating a semantic-cognitive apparatus that tackles business problems is a promising development method. During the game sessions it is possible to create a flow of events and decisions far more intense than under real-life conditions. As a result of the game, participants gain an ability to arrive at the right solutions. It is worth noting that the business potential of the people trained with the use of this approach can be much higher than that of the existing business elite.\n\n## Preparing the event and conducting the business game\n\nThe underlying problem of Russian society is the choice of personal projects. The point is that people were given the freedom to choose the direction of personal growth, while removing the methodology of project initiation from the curriculum of educational institutions.\n\nI have studied the education programs of the leading universities in Russia that train project managers and identified the lack of a project initiation stage. Thus, the younger generation will be competent in many issues, but not in choosing personal development directions. Young people will be engaged in randomly selected activities. It is worth noting that the socio-political structure of society that existed in the Soviet Union did not emphasize the need to choose personal perspective projects. There are no significant works on this topic in the literature, with the exception of a few theses stated by G. Altshuller. Consequently, it is reasonable to create a highly effective educational local tool to solve the above-described problem.\n\n### Factor analysis\n\nIn the process of analysis, I identified thirty-one factors that have a significant impact on the success of the choice of project activities. Implementing all of the factors was a nearly impossible task in my circumstances, for which reason I identified three factors that were the most critical in my view:\n\n1. The choice of an IT platform for deploying a personal project. With existing technologies, it is possible to implement a viable project.\n\n2. Time and time-conditioned problems. In every historical time there is a set of problems that must be solved, and on which success heavily depends. It is important to be able to recognize and distinguish them from the unpromising.\n\n3. The resource potential of the place where the actor is located. Resources surround us in every location. What often happens is that we don't perceive a resource as valuable when we have it because everyone around us has it. By pooling resources, moving them to other locations, or bringing in critically important resources from other locations, we get more opportunities.\n\n### Development of event program and other documents\n\nIn order to develop an event, it is important to determine the following:\n\n· What do you expect to receive as a result of the event? Are there important intermediate results to be obtained (photo and video footage, participant feedback, completed questionnaires);\n\n· Understand how much time you have;\n\n· How to implement the methodology.\n\nPutting these three components together, you create a per-minute plan for the event, based on which you then write a theoretical introduction, prepare presentations, develop game mechanics and handouts (task cards). It is recommended to write an announcement and release of the event in advance.\n\n### Negotiations with the location owner \n\nBefore the event, get more specific information about the following:\n\n· Time and place of the event;\n\n· Availability of equipment (in units): tables, chairs, projectors. Request photos of the projector and plugs;\n\n· The floor area of the space and its configuration. Availability of toilet;\n\n· If there are other events planned at the same time as your event or immediately before/after. If the answer is yes, ask questions to specify details;\n\n· If photo and video recording is possible;\n\n· Coordinate the announcement of the event and releases after its holding;\n\n· Participants-involving mechanisms and areas of responsibility;\n\n· Discuss the financial matter.\n\n### Rehearsal\n\nIt is necessary to hold a rehearsal of the event with at least one listener in order to clarify the timing. Read over the prepared text part aloud as if you were already performing in front of an audience. Make sure your gesticulation is moderate, pay attention to the tempo of your speech (I read 3-4 times). It is necessary to watch your emotionality: your emotions during the speech should be more intense than in everyday life by 30-40%. By not showing emotion, you run the risk of being boring, but you shouldn't overact either.\n\n### Preparation\n\nCome to the event ahead of time to check the availability of handouts and all documents, flash cards with presentations/video clips. If a photographer and videographer work at the event, provide them with technical task that will set out your expectations from the result of their work. Check the availability of chairs, tables, a projector and the ability to print your presentation on the screen. Make oneself look presentable.\n\n### Business event execution\n\nIf all previous stages of preparation are well done, then participants will be as engaged as possible during the event. Thus, it is necessary to keep track of time and interrupt participants who go beyond the timing.\n\n### Collecting results\n\nAfter the event is completed, you need to get the result. What is meant by a result?\n\n· Financial results;\n\n· Reporting photos and videos;\n\n· Social ties and good relationships;\n\n· Positive emotions and psychic income from the work well done;\n\n· Materials for a study or research paper.",

        "text": "Since January of this year, I intended on choosing myself because I am tired of being slave of my emotions. I am very anxious and overthinks a lot. I did meditation, journaling, read self help books, listened and watched on motivational talks. At first, it feels great, my mood got better. However these past days, I felt empty. It was weighing me down preventing me to do the healthy routines. I think it is because of the sudden change of perspective? I learned that I am living my whole life in autopilot. Thare are so many things to unlearn. It is overwhelming. I feel like there is something fading inside me. During meditation, I can feel all the pain that was kept for a long time. It hurts so much. I am aware that this is all part of the process but is it really this painful?. It feels like I was losing the strength to continue this journey because this feels lonely.  Because of this, I haven't taken a bath for 3 days now 😭. I can't function well. Is there someone who went through this phase too?",

        "text": "I just recently turned 21 years old. Throughout college so far, I have been pretty determined to improve myself. I have quit nicotine and I have been lifting consistently for around 4 years. I really enjoy the idea of improving at getting better at things so this part of my mindset I am proud to have.\n\nBut, through these efforts I feel like I am not seeing the results that I really want. I have never had a girlfriend before and I can't but to help this is because I am short. I am even shorter than the \"short guys\". I am around 5'5\" and the reddit browsing has made me even more anxious and insecure than I was. There are people who are my height but are much older who post about being alone all their lives. And I get really scared. I understand that it is futile to focus on things that I can't change but it's so hard for me to feel secure with myself when people around me point it out. They start using it against me as well. \"Oh, you can only do that many pushups/pullups because your arms are shorter\". \"Oh, he has a lower center of mass\". I know these are probably true, but I don't understand how people could insult me for being short and then belittle any accomplishment I have using my height as well. I swear I try my best to not get visually upset whenever someone says these things. I understand that it is ugly being short but what am I supposed to do? I try so hard to improve things that are wrong about me but it really frustrates me that I can't improve this.\n\nSome of my friends just seem to be sitting on their asses all day playing video games have gotten a girlfriend before me and other success before me. The worst part is, all I see sometimes when I see my friends are the things that they are better than me at. I feel so old and behind and I've felt this way since I was 18 and every year I get worried because I can't ever do things right.\n\nI really don't want to think this way anymore and would love to have healthier attitude toward things. I never feel like I want to do things, but that I have to. \"I have to workout, I have to read this, I have to get better at chess, I have to get better at this,\" etc. I would kill myself but unfortunately I don't think I can.",

        "text": "\n\nI think there's a common sentiment of not taking incidents or comments as personal attacks, and if those comments are actually meant to be offensive, you should let go of the feelings and 'forgive' them or accept it with humor.\n\nBut at the same time, things people say about you or how they treat you can be an indicator of your personal flaws or failings. It might be hurtful to grasp but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily untrue.\n\nFor example, if people constantly talk over you in conversations or don't take you seriously or talk shit about you in front of you or when people are constantly trying to 'teach' you things well you damn well understood it already, it could be an indicator that others don't think you are worthy of respect, either because of the way you put yourself or accomplishments just aren't worthy.\n\nIf you take it personally, at least you'll have fuel to improve yourself in many aspects of life, such as going to the gym, being more disciplined, being more social and assertive, so that the people who gave you hard time can't really bring you down like they use to because they don't really have the ammo.\n\nThe only problem is remembering and keeping all the things that are directed to you, bearing that weight alone, while at the same time not try to explode that on anybody all at once, but instead slowly releasing them as strong fuel for your goals. But holding to this stress is about the resiliency of the person more than anything.\n\nI feel like the common sentiment of 'taking it easy' or 'forgiving' makes you more content with your flawed self and subservient of the people who wronged you. It's not like you can have the power to 'forgive' them in the first place at the level you're at.\n\nBut at the same time, holding on to the resentment, and keeping tabs on your wins and losses along the way to your goal can be quite exhausting. Maybe this is just normal for everybody? and I'm just whining about it",

I felt really bad. I've seen people who are still in touch with close high school friends who still talk everyday and here I'm, became forgettable in everyone's memory which makes me question if I am lacking in something. Im done with all this, I want to move on, I've picked up hobbies, I'm keeping myself busy but the loneliness and hurt inside me cant seem to fade.",
