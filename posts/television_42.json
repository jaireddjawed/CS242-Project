I thought I would have a laugh and see what people posted about this show online, and, much to my surprise, people seem to love this show. I feel like I'm living in bizarro world. The acting is.....eh, the characters do the dumbest things ever just so they can initiate an action sequence (a school full of zombies? Let's not only hide in the music room, but lets pound on a drum while we're at it!), and the non-stop camera movement is nauseating and it really takes away from what would otherwise be an incredible set.\n\nWhat am I missing about this show? Why does everyone love it so much and how the hell does it have 89% on rotten tomatoes?",

        "text": "This can apply to any other media like cinema. \n\nHere’s mine:\n\n1. The villain is a bland corporation/businessperson/corporate official who only cares about money and power. \n\nWe have enough of these in real life.\n\n2. Couples divorcing after their child dies/disappears, despite having no issues beforehand.\n\nI prefer couples coping with their child’s death/disappearance together rather than just divorcing on the spot.\n\n3. Character being segregated into certain factions or groups (like rich and poor) and can only do things related to their side.\n\nSegregation is just bad all around.\n\n4. Mental illness excusing a villain’s actions.\n\nIt can play into them, but shouldn’t be used as a crutch.\n\n5. Abusive, absent-minded, or alcoholic parent(s).\n\nAlso too many of these in real life.\n\n6. Villains imprisoning the hero(es) instead of killing them when they have no reason to keep them alive.\n\nThis is okay in some instances, but not when the villain has multiple chances to rid themselves of the heroes and avoid further complications.\n\n7. Hero(es) who were born “special” and told they can do things because of said specialness.\n\nEveryone should be special and not just one person.\n\n8. Ignorant and/or useless military and law enforcement.\n\nThey’re supposed to do their jobs and they often do, but sometimes they don’t in fiction.\n\n9. Writers killing secondary characters and using their deaths as excuses to spare main characters. As in, the main characters are always safe while the side characters are chopped liver.\n\nSo many shows are guilty of this. Instead of just killing them off in unnecessary, mean-spirited ways, just make them disappear or give the main characters actual stakes.\n\n10. Lazy kidnappings where the hero(es) can easily escape, such as being poorly gagged and/or restrained.\n\nThis is probably justified because of reshoots, weather, and body, but it’s still annoying sometimes.\n\n11. Characters who date despite having no chemistry.\n\nRelationships should be built up, not rushed.\n\n12. Gay characters portrayed as campy and promiscuous.\n\nThis is true in some cases, but not for all gay people.\n\n13. Characters being stupid for the sake of the plot.\n\nAnd not in an entertaining way.\n\n14. The “family character” whose traits solely revolve around their family.\n\nThere’s some decent examples of this, but there’s also plenty of bad ones.\n\n15. Villains making others do their dirty work instead of doing it themselves.\n\nThis is okay sometimes, but not when the villain is perfectly capable of doing their own work.\n\n16. Love triangles because it’s torturing to watch someone use two others instead of just picking one or doing polyamory.\n\nLove triangles are just the worst. Just pick one or do polyamory.\n\n17. Abrupt and/or open-ended endings.\n\nI like satisfying endings where mostly everything gets wrapped up.\n\n18. Time travel restrictions in which characters can’t play with time because of “rules” or “paradoxes.”\n\nThis is sensical for most, but to me, it’s annoying.\n\n\n19. The evil/fake lover, a character who loves someone but is later revealed to be evil and using them.\n\nProbably my most hated trope on here because of how overused it is.\n\n20. The themes, “If you kill them, you’re no better than them” or “I killed someone so now I’m crazy.”\n\nThis especially applies for characters simply acting in self-defense.\n\n21. Characters treated as plot devices instead of characters.\n\nCharacters should feel like real people, not objects.\n\n22. Amnesia stories where characters forget everything and take forever to regain their memories.\n\nThis one isn’t bad, but definitely overused.\n\n23. Characters saying, “Well, well, well…”\n\nReal characters say this just as much as cartoons.\n\n24. Characters (heroes or villains) who do bad things and never face consequences for them, either by refusing to own up to them or not being punished by others.\n\nBasically characters whose poor actions aren’t called out or they take the easy way out to avoid punishment.\n\n25. Heroes spitting into villains’ faces after getting captured.\n\nI’ve never understood this one.\n\nWhat are yours? 👀",

        "text": "*NB: 100% opinionated and personalized list. Choices limited to my personal viewing history, and shows were chosen based on originality, creativity and uniqueness (as those are 3 main factors I look for in TV shows).* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 25 TV Shows of 2022 (Version 2):\n\n \n\n* 25. [**Ritmo salvaje**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/416924/posters/621f826572d58.jpg) (Savage Rhythm) \\[Netflix\\]\n\nCentering around 2 women, a street dancer and ballet dancer, whose worlds conveniently collides in order to seek success in both their ambitions, Ritmo salvaje is a Colombian series where the plot isn't its main highlight... but instead the production design and visuals. Sure, its dramatic storytelling inches close to that of a telenovela (*though in that way still very much enjoyable*), and sure, it's a dance show that could've had some more dance scenes, but the coordinating aesthetics of the lightning and sets, as well as the stylistic wardrobe and hairstyles, really makes this series quite a unique visual experience. Visually pleasing in more ways than one, Ritmo salvaje is a fun and sexy series packed with drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 24. [**Blocco 181**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/418453/posters/628160000b603.jpg) (Sky Atlantic)\n\nSet in Italy, in a small fictional housing project call 'Blocco 181', this series of that same name is a gang-related crime drama centered around the El Salvadorian residents and their rivalry with Italian gangsters. Blocco 181 has almost all the street crime-drama clichés in the book, with so many familiarities that it may feel like you've seen this exact show before but under a different banner. But that's probably also apart of the reason why this series is so enjoyable. Mainly following Bea, the little sister of the neighborhood leader but just a small-time criminal in a larger neighborhood criminal system, Bea finds that her ambitions stretches further than what life living in Blocco 181 would offer her. So she forms a relationship with Ludo and Mahdi, both from other sides of that world, one even from a rival gang, but the three attempts to kickstart their own illegal business. The polygamous relationship formed between the 3 is the most unique aspect of the series. The show's simplicity and predictability feels convenient for viewers, not deterring its enjoyability at all, especially since we don't get many shows like this one often, much less foreign-language ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 23. [**Pam &amp; Tommy**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/400690/posters/61faa228a0fae.jpg) (Hulu)\n\nAt first sight the most impressive thing about Pam &amp; Tommy is Lily James' transformation into the iconic model for her portrayal, but everything else about this series is damn near just as commendable. Pam \\&amp;amp;Tommy really hits it out the park with great performances and the sincere sentiments that puts the focus character in the position where viewers can't help but be empathetic for her. It's even sadder knowing this all happened in real life, as Pamela Anderson becomes collateral damage in a rivalry that really has nothing to do with her.\n\n \n\n* 22. [**Skruk**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/418107/posters/62b3213a705f9.jpg) (Netflix)\n\nAbout an fertility doctor who inseminates herself with her ex-boyfriend's sperm, this premise may sound absurd, but Skruk is actually a down-to-earth Danish series that finds the perfect balance between realism and absurdity. Nana (played by Josephine Park) is the fertility doctor in question, a middle-aged woman living an average/mundane life, who often finds herself making up stories about her 'troubles with childbearing' to comfort her patients who are actually facing these issues... despite never having faced them herself. After discovering something unfortunate about her own body regarding the topic, Nana's made-up stories advances from the ears of her doubtful patients, to those of her friends, close relatives and love interests, and she soon finds it difficult to keep track of all her lies. It's dramatic, but also a great character study, and a series that shines a sympathetic light on infertile women, single mothers, and other women having babies under unconventional circumstances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 21. [**Håber du kom godt hjem**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/423733/posters/630228ea8e08e.jpg) (Where Were You?) \\[Viaplay\\]\n\nA group of teenagers break into their school one night to have a get-together, they are followed by an outcast who wasn't really invited, and by the time everyone has left, one girl wakes up on the field discovering that she had been raped. That's pretty much the premise of this heavy themed drama, and being a series centered around rape, I must applaud its dark and cold visuals and gloomy atmosphere which really expresses the despondence of the situation. But being a crime-drama about rape and centered around teenagers, the series comes with a few clichés. For one it's left up to our main character, a teenage girl, to investigate and figure out who the assailant is, with no help from the police. I don't even think there was a crime scene here. Second, this is another crime series that cares more about 'whodunnit' than the actual victim herself. Though, there are a few scenes that depicts how hard it is for rape victims to reenter society, and though it could have been more about that, the actual mystery is quite engaging, with a few twists and turns that plays with your expectations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 20. [**Peacemaker**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/391153/posters/61acbe62c2df6.jpg) (HBO Max)\n\nIf you were a fan of The Suicide Squad (2021), or a fan of James Gunn's wild action sequences and puerile humor in general, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't like Peacemaker. It's immature and crass, but also heartwarming with its in-depth look at the main characters and surprisingly great performances from the likes of John Cena. Overall, it's just fun, very entertaining comic-book series that doesn't offend in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 19. [**My Dress-Up Darling**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/401233/posters/61ab789717a97.jpg) (Tokyo MX)\n\nA sweet, heartwarming, and occasionally funny slice-of-life anime which also serves as a love letter to cosplaying, My Dress-Up Darling centers around an aspiring kashira-shi and first year high school loner Wakana Gojo, and the spontaneous bond he develops with his extroverted school crush, the quirky and passionate cosplayer-wannabe, Marin Kitagawa. Kitgawa introduces Gojo to the world of cosplaying, also with the games, manga, and anime that inspires them. In turn, Gojo uses his dollmaking skills to make costumes and even do make-up for Kitagawa... and might've even found his purpose, even though it may stray away from his initial dreams to be just like his kashira-shi grandfather who raised him. It's a simple anime series with simplistic animation and art style. It would've been even more fun if they were cosplaying from popular titles, but it's surprising how well-detailed and focused this anime is when it comes to cosplaying. The ending was also left a bit too open for me, it felt like the characters still had internal conflicts to be resolved, but even so, this is an anime that aims to highlight the positive side of modern-day youth and friendships, and the bond between Gojo and Kitgawa is quite lovely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 18. [**Bad Sisters**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/418182/posters/62ecefd25190f.jpg) (Apple TV+)\n\nA remake of the 2012 Belgian series 'Clan', Bad Sisters jumps back and forth between the past, where we see a group of sisters trying to kill their piece of shit brother-in-law to save their sister from her own marriage; and the present where we see a couple of insurance men investigating the murder of said brother-in-law because their insurance company is a sham and they can't payout the money owed. Now initially, everything about both these situations is just absolutely hilarious. But being the type of series that plays with the viewers' emotions, Bad Sisters doesn't take too long to show its emotional versatility, and uses it much to its advantage. Every one of the 5 sisters has an individual story here, and each of them have been wronged by 'the prick' in some way, so they all have reasons for wanting him dead, and the combination of all that (including the personal woes of the insurance brothers), makes for a nail-biting, funny, and touching TV series all in one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 17.  [**Under the Queen's Umbrella**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/423949/posters/6321615e64690.jpg) (tvN)\n\nSet in the Joseon period with a fictional story about a dedicated queen protecting her princes in a game of thrones between them and other queens and princes in a dynasty, the situation Under the Queen's Umbrella presents will not be a conventional one for Western audiences. But even if you're just watching it for the history and culture as oppose to plot, this sageuk is most intriguing. The sets, costumes and production overall are spectacular... even though the editing style is similar to most K-dramas. The storytelling is great. So too are the sentiments as it's a period-drama with modern sensibilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 16. [**This is Going to Hurt**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/378990/posters/62ff830519e8a.jpg) (BBC One)\n\nFollowing junior doctor Adam Kay in his chaotic job in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ben Whishaw's live-wire performance of an exhausted doctor powers This is Going to Hurt, a smart drama full of humor and pain. It's the best medical drama in years because, instead of celebrating idealized superhuman doctors, it observes how broken systems force real doctors to attempt superhuman feats. And it doesn't shy away from depicting the the crippling effect it can have on those doctors as well, as the series tends to go to extremely dark and depressing places, even though there's plenty of witty humor throughout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 15. [**Les Papillons noirs**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/396501/posters/6308c78e2f3ca.jpg) (Black Butterflies) \\[Arte\\]\n\nStarting off about a dying old man hiring a ghostwriter to retell his story to for a potential novel, Les papillons noirs definitely had potential to be a *top 5 show*, but ended up being uneven writing-wise. A French miniseries featuring multiple subplots, The best parts of the series are undeniably the flashbacks, which tells the story of a post-World War II French couple with unfortunate beginnings, whose trauma eventually leads them down a disturbingly odd killing spree, where they kill rapist men and have sex beside their dead bodies. These scenes, sometimes coming in montages, are innovative, stylistic and often horrific. They're the creative peak of the entire series, *and also why this show makes this list*. Les papillons noirs tries to weave its multiple plot threads featuring themes of infidelity, jealousy, unhealthy romances, and the aggressive nature of men, into something complex here... but the end result is something that's just too far fetch with too many plot twists.\n\n \n\n* 14. [**Irma Vep**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/393404/posters/6297e19b2810d.jpg) (HBO)\n\nCentered around the set of a remake of the French silent film classic, \"Les Vampires\", and the American actress that came to France to play the lead role but who later finds it difficult to separate herself from the character, Irma Vep is a meta series that takes a bit of effort to wrap your head around... even though it's nothing overly-complex. It's a sequel, but also a remake of of the 1996 film of the same name. That film served as a critique of the French film industry at the time, and in the same way, this remake/sequel critiques the modern television industry and the way it chooses to tell stories. In that regard it is quite brilliant, but makes for a difficult watch at times, with its exhaustingly slow pace and the unurgent manner it goes about doing anything. Still, I get the feeling everything that annoyed me about this series was done on purpose to have that exact effect. The deadpan presentation, the pretentiousness of most of the conversations between the actors (and directors), the lengthy episodes that really stretches the little amount of plot they have to fill them etc. All of these peeves, especially the latter, are quite persistent in modern television.\n\n \n\n* 13. [**The Tatami Time Machine Blues**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/season/2025086/posters/634a6abede3b4.jpg) (Disney+)\n\nThe Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel (*or second installment*) to the 2010 anime The Tatami Galaxy, but you'd never know from just watching this, as it's completely self-contained, telling one story from start to finish. It's a short anime about students in a hot university dorm who just happened to find a time machine one day..... and an air-conditioning remote control that leaps through time. It's fun, it's silly, and at the same time cleverly written with quirky characters and a plot that impressively comes full circle. The animation is unique in the best way possible, looking like a Japanese water painting in motion, which is apparently the signature style of the anime studio that produced it, Science SARU. The Tatami Time Machine is a thrilling show to watch... and easily one of the best anime I've seen in 2022.\n\n \n\n* 12. [**Mood**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/415633/posters/621f6488902ec.jpg) (BBC Three)\n\nCreated and written by Nicôle Lecky, based on her one-woman play 'Superhoe', Mood follows 25-year-old wannabe singer Sasha, as she navigates the alluring world of social media and the fine line between liberation and exploitation. The series is an intense and unapologetic exploration of female agency, racism and ambition, with genuine UK dialect, a tendency for surrealism, and enticing musical numbers. Nicôle Lecky shows off her many talents with a variety of original songs and an enthralling performance as lead actress, and the series certainly isn't lacking in emotions, as performances are delivered with tremendous earnestness whether through music or dialogue. Mood does well in depicting how the effects of neglectful parenting can seep its way into early adulthood, and the pernicious grip social media can have on those with big ambitions, and that (along with other aspects) leads this show to being one of the most refreshing and unique UK dramas we've seen in the past few years.\n\n \n\n* 11. [**The Bear**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/403294/posters/62cb2fad70271.jpg) (Hulu)\n\nWith a premise that touches on an important part of our society we don't get on the small screen often enough, topped off by an outstanding signature performance by Jeremy Allen White, The Bear was probably the best series released in the summer of 2022... at least where U.S. mainstream television is concerned. The series follows Carmen \"Carmy\" Berzatto, a young chef from the fine dining world, who comes home to Chicago to run his family sandwich shop after the death of his brother. It's a series that captivates you with compelling performances, and that captivation soon becomes even stronger with its anxiety-inducing depiction of the stressful and chaotic fast-food workplace. The frequent close-up shots works to the series advantage in highlighting how clustered those kinds of workplace environment usually are, but also how sporadically frantic or routine it can be for the workers themselves. The more the script digs deeper into their personal lives, the more you can see how much of a struggle it all can be for them.\n\n \n\n* 10. [**High School**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/395679/posters/6347902ac7fd4.jpg) (Amazon Freevee)\n\nHigh School can be watched and enjoyed as one or all of these things: 1. A bio series about the upbringing of musicians Tegan and Sara serializing how they got their start in music. 2. A teen show about the day to day lives of 2 twin sisters living in the early 90s. 3. An LGBTQ+ show, specifically about lesbianism for young girls living in a time where sexuality wasn't discussed much so the lines were blurred. Based on the 2019 memoir of the same name by Tegan and Sara Quin, High School is a great show by all 3 of these regards. It's down-to-earth, it's genuine, and it's nostalgic... not just in an aesthetic or trope kind of way, but in a way that makes the viewer long for simpler times. Like any other teen show there are the everyday conflicts with their parents, friends, and love interests of course, but High School keeps it really simple, capturing the mundane of high school and living in the suburbs, in a way that's captivating but also honest. See that's the thing, High School knows exactly what it is and doesn't attempt to do too much nor force any of its themes. It's simple plot just moves steadies through its visually cold and quiet Canadian small town setting, with a gentle and endearing tone, soft and polite dialogue, and music that is probably a playlist of the real-life duo's early influences and a great representation of the time period.\n\n \n\n* 9. [**The English**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/402602/posters/636eb685429a3.jpg) (BBC Two)\n\nA *spaghetti* western in style and setting, but visually colorful with stunning wide shots showcasing gorgeous landscapes, and the occasional close-ups that will have you feeling like you're watching *Gunsmoke*, The English is a pretty great modern take on the Western genre. The series follows an Englishwoman and an ex-cavalry scout Pawnee who cross paths under unfortunate circumstances, and decides to help each other on their motives. Story-wise it's a bit uneven, with reveals that seem to have been thought of on a whim, and scenes that plays for too long, but it certainly doesn't lacking in depth or emotions. There are some creative action sequences here too, as well as a fantastic soundtrack, as the story unfolds into an operatic tale of revenge and romance set against the backdrop of a lawless American west in the late 19th century.\n\n \n\n* 8. [**Somebody**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/398217/posters/633bd372d92e0.jpg) (Netflix)\n\nSomebody is a psychological-thriller that kicks off when an autistic web developer of a dating app called \"Somebody\" is matched with someone who, unbeknownst to her at first, is a psychopathic killer with mixed extreme personalities who've been using the app to find his victims. He also gets involved with her friends, one a police officer who's paraplegic, and the other a shaman, who both try to track him down in a cat and mouse game of tragic occurrences. The story might sound familiar, but the way the series goes about telling it is far from, to the point where it's hard to describe really. The attitude of the series is almost laid back or easygoing, but that doesn't make the viewing experience any less chilling, especially with an outstanding performance from Kim Young-kwang who presents the near 7ft psycho killer to much eerie results. There's also those long sequences where our characters finds themselves in grave danger, and the series certainly doesn't shy away from gruesomeness or cruelty.\n\n \n\n* 7. [**Clark**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/394447/posters/627e8db67196c.jpg) (Netflix)\n\nIf there's something modern television always seems to get right, it's stories about *larger-then-life* criminals from the 1970s that society might've forgotten. Clark especially knocks this concept out the park, giving a very creative and energetic mash-up of the truth and lies behind the life and crimes of one Clark Olofsson, a Swedish criminal who was famously involved in the Norrmalmstorg robbery (that lead to the coining of the term \" Stockholm syndrome\"). Portrayed by Bill Skarsgård, he brings a lot of charm to the character, which seems just about accurate considering all the women Olofsson dated, married and had children with despite spending half his life in prison. The show in its own way is adventurous, outlandish, and free-willed, imitating the attitude of its centerpiece character, but one thing it doesn't copy is his unwillingness to open up emotionally.\n\n \n\n* 6. [**Funeral For a Dog**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/415947/posters/62330feaebf14.jpg) (Sky Atlantic)\n\nFuneral For a Dog concurringly tells 3 connecting tales, that doesn't necessarily intertwines, but comes at a meeting point via the past, and also via a troubled journalist looking to do a piece on a writer whose novel has gained acclaimed for its realistic storytelling and characters. Set in the years between 1998 to 2010, Funeral For a Dog jumps back and forth between those years... but unlike most other series that have utilized this narrative style before, this is one of the most warranted, especially given the 'show not tell' nature of the series. At it's core is an intricately nuanced and emotionally in-depth story that starts off as a romance between 3 people, before slowly transitioning into a mystery of the sudden disappearance of one involved. Though, it can feel like the series is losing steam the more it transitions into a 'whodunnit', as the characters' journey and woes, both together and separate from each other, is the most compelling aspect of the series. Luckily, the majority of the series is just that. Funeral For a Dog is youthful and romantic when it needs to be, mysterious when it needs to be, and even devastating when it needs to be. It's a series that's as much about love as it is about loss. The most praise-worthy aspect of Funeral For a Dog though is its production. Something that they really could've cheapen out on and probably get the same story (but not the same results), but no, Sky productions went all out, filming in multiple different locations and efficiently taking viewers on a cinematic journey around the world as we follow the 3 main characters.\n\n \n\n* 5. [**Severance**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/371980/posters/621096b26f0e2.jpg) (Apple TV+)\n\nEasily one of the most intriguing of premises to grace the small screen in all of 2022, Severance twists the quotidian reality of the modern workplace into a dystopian sci-fi thriller that's equally as uneasy as it is mysterious. It's about a workplace where workers have implanted chips that effectively separates their work life and their home life, by making it impossible to access personal memories at work and vice-versa. So basically, it's like one person split into two, and \"*outie*\" and \"*innie*\" are the words used to label each side. The workplace setting, though spacious and empty, feels never-ending, and the play between 80s and modern tech does make the series feel Black Mirror-like. Unlike Black Mirror though, Severance being the slow-burner that it is, does take some time to weave its plot, going places you might expect and others places you will not. And though it takes a while to get there, the season finale will keep you on your toes, delivering a rewardingly nail-baiting and tense thrill ride of an episode, that's easily one of the best hours of television in 2022.\n\n \n\n* 4. [**All Of Us Are Dead**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/382142/posters/61ed2bad7e051.jpg) (Netflix)\n\nA multifaceted series featuring a well-constructed zombie apocalypse story, All of Us Are Dead makes good use of all the expected tropes plus other inventive ideas, to make for a very well-rounded and fulfilling project. A series that might remind you of the anime Highschool of the Dead by its similar east Asian high school setting (as well as other nearby areas where the outbreak is rapidly spreading), we get a variety of charming and compelling characters, whose personalities, relationships, conflicts etc. are intensified after being forced under new deadly circumstances. What makes All of Us Are Dead a standout is that it starts as a teen-drama, and at it's core remains one throughout the happenings of its apocalyptic event, even though there are political aspects on the side to give a full scope of the situation. And it's honestly one of the most genuine and wholesome depictions of teenagers I've ever seen on television, from the way they act, their attitudes, their jokes, their quirkiness, and their awkwardness. Amongst gruesome and horrific flesh-eating moments, All of Us Are Dead also delivers adequate amounts of humor and playfulness, as well as some cool looking action sequences. But even so, these attributes makes way for instances of poignance and tragedy over and over again, giving the series much emotional weight and solidifying its well-roundedness.\n\n \n\n* 3. [**Pachinko**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/368124/posters/62a4d7f4af97a.jpg) (Apple TV+)\n\nOne of the most moving and intimate TV shows of 2022, Pachinko tells a timelessly universal story of immigrants throughout the world, via a Korean family moving to Japan in the 20th century. Based on the namesake novel written by Korean American author Min Jin Lee, this multi-lingual and multinational drama depicts the life of Sunja, born to a poor family in Busan in the early 1900s. The series jumps back and forth from past to present, highlighting her journey from 1915 Busan to 1989 New York, as the 1910-1945 Japanese colonial rule forces her to move to Japan. She and her family goes through shifting fortunes, heart-breaking tragedies and massive world events, for a historical epic of hardships and struggle. It doesn't miss a beat when it comes to emotions, thanks to an intricate performance from Kim Min-ha, and is heart-wrenching and deep to the core. Pachinko's multilingual, multicultural approach to storytelling is not only apt but authentic. It also helps convey the emotions central to this show, which is heavily about belonging and othering. Deeply emotional, and breathtaking in every department, whether that may be cinematography, production design, music etc., Pachinko is epic in scope but intimate in focus. It's a series that looks grand and majestic, but it's the trials and tribulations of the characters that really takes center stage.\n\n \n\n* 2. [**Ida tar ansvar**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/412655/posters/61f44dea6ecf2.jpg) (Ida Takes Charge) (Viaplay)\n\nIda Tar Ansvar is a psychological drama that follows Ida, a psychology student who's soft-spoken and overly-cautious, with seemingly both social and anticipatory anxiety. She's someone who's very susceptible to what she hears on the news or reads online, so she walks around in constant fear that something bad is going to happen. Sometimes her actions are guided by this fear, and this becomes the case after she discovers the disturbing reddit account of her anti-social school mate Aksel, who she immediately sees as a potential school shooter or mass murder. What Ida does next out of her own fear is surprising, shocking even, but maybe not the wisest decision as it eventually leaves her in a situation that's like being in between a rock and a hard place.\n\nThe series is an excellent character study, and the dynamic between Ida and Askel is fascinating to watch, as in some ways, both seem to be on different sides of the same coin... but one's far more further on the deep end of course. The inner monologue mixed with the old-timey music makes the series feel like a less energetic The End of the F\\*\\*\\*ing World at times, but the tone here, is effortlessly brooding. No sinister music, calm atmosphere, but still there's a strong sense of impending danger here. The execution really brings to screen the main character's anxiety while also keeping things reality based. By adding samples of our harsh society in its script, Ida Tar Ansvar is a series that will make viewers think and keep them guessing. It's moot, but unfortunately enough people will not have seen it to garner the amount of discussion it deserves. It doesn't have many moving parts, but it's quite a unique idea, and being just about 3 and a half hours long, it doesn't overstay its welcome, yet leaves quite an impact. Production-wise it isn't one of the more embellished, but still, it is one of the most impressive shows of 2022.\n\n \n\n* 1. [**Prisma**](https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/423808/posters/632aed3cd2016.jpg) (Amazon Prime Video)\n\nLudovico Bessegato is the head writer and director of the Italian remake of the popular Norwegian teen drama Skam, titled 'Skam Italia'. Being a remake that more or less parallels the narrative and plot of the original though, Skam Italia doesn't allow for much originality or innovation from its writers. But with this new side project, Ludovico Bessegato proves that he knows exactly what the fuck he is doing, creating (writing and directing) a coming-of-age series similar in essence to the likes of Skam; one that's down-to-earth, naturalistic, and explores familiar themes in the most genuine way, as if out the lenses of reality itself, which allows this series to reach greater emotional heights and carry deeper meaning than even the shows it was inspired by.\n\nTaking a look into the day-to-day of several teenagers in the quiet Italian town of 'Latina', whose lives has been intertwined by mutual friendships, Prisma explores self-identity, gender fluidity, sexual boundaries etc. It's coated in realism, but melodrama seeps through the threads, coming about naturally, as if inevitable. At the center of all this, are identical twins, Andrea and Marco, brilliantly portrayed by first time actor Mattia Carrano, who subtly brings to screen the inner worlds and outer manifestations of two different gender archetypes. They are supported by a charming and exceptional set of characters. There's Carola, a disabled girl booming with confidence; Danielle, an aspiring young rapper; and Nina, a lesbian who's quite assertive but also a bit of a trouble-maker etc. But what's refreshing and at the same time intriguing about about this group, is that their dynamics don't align the way you'd expect them to. Every relationship developed here feels unprecedented and effervescent. Every interaction, authentic and captivating. Every intimate moment, charming and blasting with emotions. Prisma shows us that sometimes, love is love, no matter the sexuality, gender, or condition... probably better than any other series has tried to in the past.\n\nPrisma for sure provides intriguing dynamics between its characters, delving into their ambiguous profiles as perplexed young people, trapped between the constraints of physical appearance and their inner desires, between social roles and genuine feelings, ambitions and temptations. It's character work is nuanced, and so too is the cinematography. Filmed on site, in possibly one of the most perfectly mundane places for characters who are existentially lost and struggling to define themselves, the series is shot almost like a fantasy drama, with a mix of varied wide and close-up shots. Blended with its beautiful soundtrack/music and slow-motion sequences, there's another layer of captivation here, and it makes the series all the more satisfying to watch.",

        "text": "Y'all ready to dive deep into the mind of one of the most iconic characters in TV history? We're talkin' Ross Geller from Friends, and let me tell you, this dude is a whole other level of complexity.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about how Ross is the ultimate nerd. Paleontologist? Check. Constant need to prove he's right? Check. But don't let that fool you, cuz Ross also has a major emotional side. He's a cryer, a lover, a fighter - this dude wears his heart on his sleeve.\n\nBut the real complexity of Ross comes from his on-again, off-again relationship with Rachel. You're never quite sure if these two are gonna end up together, but you can't help but root for them. It's like watching a soap opera, but better cuz it's Friends.\n\nSo, let's break down Ross Geller and uncover the layers of this TV legend. Are you ready? Because #RossGellerRevealed is about to blow your mind. What's your take on Ross Gellar's other sides.",
