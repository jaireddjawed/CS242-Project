Eating out is not frugal, but if you end up spending a lot of money including tips, it creates a disincentive to eat out, which is frugal. so tip people get some karma as well as build frugal habits",

There's also no condensation in or on anything (and it's been cold here cause it's winter even though I set my thermostat pretty high it's not always exactly that thanks to drafts windows and doors).

        "text": "If you're dealing with unexpected cold by running a space heater, be aware that they use a lot of electricity. One year I was using a very common model to heat an area of the house I needed to work in, and didn't turn it off overnight; I left it to run on its own thermostat. I was surprised to find that our electric bill literally doubled that month. I thought the heater must have a short or something, got rid of it and replaced it with a newer model. Our electric company uses an online data display that lets you view your power usage down to the hour, and it was clear that the new one used as much power as the older one had. It wasn't broken; they just cost that much to run. Takeaway: turn off your space heater when you leave the room. \n\nOn top of this: if you're dealing with unexpected severe cold, you may be discovering your windows and doors are letting in drafts. You'll add to your comfort level by covering windows-- completely, not partially; see if you can find a way to improvise drapes. If you don't have weather stripping on your doors, you can fashion some with duct tape and cardboard, using masking tape underneath so that they will be removable when you have the time to install the real thing. It may look shabby but it can make a difference in a weather crisis situation.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion on the economics of heating in this forum over time, and it's worth spending a little time with. I just wanted to pass along my own experience with space heaters. I should also mention that fire fighters will tell you that space heaters are the #1 cause of household fires in the winter, so watch their proximity to curtains, upholstered furniture, etc.",

He went to the store alone because he had the day off, and he actually bought marked down (3.99/lb!!) ground lamb for our meal prep next week. Then he asked the bakery if they could cut two different pies in half (we've never thought of asking this before) so we could have a variety for Christmas without pigging out.\nTHEN he saw a standing rib roast, and mind you no beef was on the list at all, but he noticed Kroger had an unadvertised (I think) sale for $5.97ish a pound! I've never made a rib roast in my life, but again, this wise fella asked the butcher to cut it into steaks, which he did, and even wrapped up the bone for us to use (soup?).\nHe got a $66 roast for $24, which equals 4 lovely Ribeyes and a pot of beef broth.\nNot only am I very pleased we switched to Kroger, but I feel so proud of my dear spendthrift being cagey and snagging us some deals!  My heart almost stopped when I saw the original price on the roast ($107!) and he was so excited to explain all his deals.",

After having some for dinner (crispy skin, yumm) I made chicken pumpkin red curry (which used home made bone broth), chicken and broccoli casserole, and chicken salad. Then I set the bones on low on the stove with a dash of apple cider vinegar to simmer for about 15 hours. Skimmed out all the solids and tossed a couple of ice cubes in the broth to quick cool it and froze it in mason jars. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Someone has posted about making your own bone meal so I thought I would give it a go and tossed the super soft bones and other skimmed bits into the blender and made a mush of bones. I specifically did not add any onions/garlic to the broth with this with in mind (I salted it after skimming and it was still very good!). I have a picky dog with allergy’s that is also on daily meds. She seems to like the bone pâté and I’m hopeful that I will be able to use a spoonful of it to hid her meds in in lieu of the $5 a can wet food I’m currently buying. I froze most of it in tablespoon sized dollops on a cookie sheet that should be easy to throw in a bag and then thaw daily to hide her meds in 🤞",

        "text": "Hello, I need help finding a decent car. \n\nThere’s a bit of background so sorry if it’s a lot, I just want to cover all possible information bases up front. \n\nI’m a full-time college student in their early 20s, I’ve never owned a car before due to being broke and not ready mentally to drive until recently due to an anxiety disorder. My college is paid for and I take home about $3-4k a semester in leftover financial aid from scholarships and grants. I live at home and do not pay rent as of right now. I have a decent and then a somewhat bad credit score (Transunion is above 700, Equifax is at 600 due to 3 yr old medical debt in collections on it). I make $18 an hour working part time about 20 hours a week due to it being an office job. I have about $12k in savings. \n\nI need a decent car for cheap enough but am a little lost in my search and will be I needing something with under 100k miles, that has decent mpg (25+), and isn’t super old and needing lots of repairs. I’ve been searching online but most cars I find that seem to meet the criteria are under the salvage title and likely have many issues with them. \n\nI will be needing to travel far enough daily for school (30 miles round trip for my university) and then probably a lot farther for a summer internship. My family members will not help me with the down payment or co-signing and I am not looking to decimate my savings as I am looking to move out in a little over a year (so I’d probably put $6k down tops). My phone bill is already $95 a month and I realistically could maybe pay about $400 total in car insurance and car payment bills a month. How do I go about finding a decent car for cheap that won’t kill me with monthly payments?",

I went to Costco today with my roommate and since we hadn’t been for a while, we purchased more than we usually do (it’s Christmas and we’re having people over etc). Our bill was high and we didn’t notice until we got home that we had 9 items missing from our purchase. You can imagine how this adds up at Costco, and we are frugal and watch prices and sales. We went back to the store and they claimed we left the store with the items. The cashier serving us was being pushy about the MasterCard and the executive card and so we were distracted and likely didn’t notice some of our items not making it onto our cart. They claimed we must have forgotten it in our cart or didn’t load it into our car. Or that our backs were turned and someone stole our items when we weren’t looking in the parking lot. There were 2 of us and this didn’t happen. \n\n\nWhen it looked like it was going nowhere, I said I would just take it up to corporate and the manager laughed at us. I got her name and we have the store number and I’m wondering what we can do in this situation. It ends up being $120 we’re out and we can split this but we are 100% sure those items didn’t make it onto our cart. It’s nearly -40 Celsius here and there are probably better scams to pull than claiming our items didn’t make it to us so we can visit Costco again in the frigid as heck temps 2 days before Christmas. Any advice?",

        "text": "Here's a counterintuitive piece of cost saving advice: shopping for fruit trees and fruiting berry bushes is a good idea in winter. The key is to buy dormant bare root plants.\n\nEven if you don't own a home, patio gardeners and houseplant people can glean bargains this way. \n\nFirst learned about this frugal trick reading *The Small Budget Gardener* by Maureen Gilmer (Cool Springs Press, 2010). Quoting:\n\n&gt; trees are sold bare root as well, particularly fruit trees. Bare root is the least expensive way to buy trees because they are dug from they field while they're dormant and then sold during the right season in your area. \n\nGilmer explain how retail prices for wintertime bare root plants are usually half what the same varieties would cost during growing season. This applies to more than just trees: berry bushes and grapevines are often sold bare root as well. And for people who own property (we'll get to apartment gardeners in a moment), bare root purchases grow to become healthier and require less water because the process fosters a healthier root system.\n\nHaving tried this out several times, Gilmer's guidance holds up. Over the past seven years we've bought bare root grapevines, a pomegranate tree, and a fig tree. All are doing well and producing yields. We're getting more than one type of harvest too: the grape leaves become dolmas, spare leaves from pruning the pomegranate tree become tea, and fig tree sap is what's known as vegetable rennet in cheesemaking. We've also gotten bare root rosebushes for our rose garden. Heading back to the plant nurseries to browse during growing season we've compared and seen it really does cost half as much to buy bare root plants during January and February.\n\n----\n\nWHAT TO GET AND HOW:\n\nFruit trees sold as bare root plants include: peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, nectarines, apples, figs, pomegranates, persimmons, mulberries, jujube, quince, and pears.\n\nBerry bushes and vining bare root plants include: blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, boysenberries, gooseberries, currants, and grapes.\n\nIt's best to research the specific variety best for your needs before shopping. For instance a type of fig called Little Miss Figgy is good for small spaces in mild climates: it tops out at four to six feet tall with a spread (diameter) of three to four feet, but it's only hardy to USDA zones 7 (0 F to 10 F) and warmer. A more cold tolerant fig called Chicago Hardy tolerates zone 5 (-20 F to -10 F) and is a much larger plant that can grow as tall as 30 feet. Both varieties are self-fertilizing--which is another trait to research before buying. Some authors say all figs can be trained to containers with pruning. That said, if you live in a warm enough climate then you would probably want a dwarf variety.\n\nContact the staff at the local nurseries to find out when they expect bare root plants to arrive. Avid gardeners usually grab the best bare root plants quickly and high demand varieties may vanish within a few days.\n\nAlso, if you find something unexpected among the bare root plants then be sure to run a Google search on its stats before taking it to the cashier. Big box retailers don't always match their plants perfectly for local climates. (Although I live in zone 9, the garden centers here stock a type of passionflower vine in summer that isn't hardy beyond zone 10, and one year I nearly bought a bare root gooseberry bush before checking its temperature range and finding out it needed zone 8 or colder).\n\n----\n\nGENERAL ONLINE REFERENCES:\n\nhttps://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/2013/02/later_winter_is_the_time_to_so.html\n\nhttps://extension.psu.edu/handling-and-planting-bare-root-plants-in-the-home-landscape\n\nhttps://modernfarmer.com/2019/02/bare-root-fruit-trees-five-reasons-you-should-order-them-this-winter/\n\nhttps://www.homesandgardens.com/advice/how-to-plant-bare-root-trees\n\nCONTAINER AND INDOOR FRUIT &amp; BERRY REFERENCES:\n\nhttps://empressofdirt.net/fruit-trees-berries-containers/\n\nhttps://www.house-plant-hobbyist.com/blog/2019/8/5/12-indoor-fruit-trees\n\nhttps://www.indoorplantsforbeginners.com/easy-to-grow-indoor-fruits/",

So with this info, I moved almost every major subscription service to a prepaid debit card that I could instantly add funds to if needed, with the goal of ensuring that there was no balance in it for recurring payments.

Here are my results basing the per day cost on a a 30 day month.\n\nAmazon Prime ($14.99/mo) - Shut off Day 4 bringing the cost down from $0.49/day to $0.45/day\n\nNetflix Basic ($9.99/mo) - Shut off Day 6 bringing the cost down from $0.33/day to $0.30/day\n\nHulu No Ads ($14.99/mo) - Shut off Day 11 bringing the cost down from $0.49/day to $0.37/day\n\nSpotify Duo ($12.99/mo) - Shut off **Day 34** bringing the cost down from $0.43/day to $0.20/day\n\nParamount+ ($9.99/mo) - Shut off Day 16 bringing the cost down from $0.33/day to $0.21\n\nDisney + I get with my cable, no idea.\n\nApple TV+ ($6.99/mo) - Shut off Day 8 bringing the cost down from $0.23/day to $0.18\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium ($17.99/mo) - Shut off Day 26 bringing the cost down from $0.59/day to $0.32/day\n\nXbox Game Pass ($14.99/mo) - Shut off Day 12 bringing the cost down from $0.49/day to $0.35/day.",

        "text": "My dad recently moved into a ground level 1 bedroom apartment in a senior / disabled apartment complex. He had been living in a tiny house I built on my property before, but we had some disagreements and we both felt it best if he moved a little further away.\n\nAnyways, before he had a propane wall mount heater, and he'd keep his place in the 80s. I literally had to stop going out and spending time with him because I'd start sweating the second I walked in. Propane was cheap, it was $50 to refill a 100lb tank at the local RV dealer, and he would go through 3 or 4 tanks a season.\n\nHis new place has a regular central air HVAC unit and its a heat pump with electric emergency backup heat strips. This is the same thing I have in my own home and I've been fine with it for 15 years. However my dad feels that heat pump heat is \"cold heat\" and despite having his thermostat on 75 (and the HVAC keeping up) that he's not warm. So he's also running one of those vicks steam humidifiers 24/7 as well as a couple space heaters.\n\nHis electric bill was $75 in November, and $150 now in December. And its only been dipping into the 20s at night. This weekend we have negative temperatures coming.\n\nThe apartment is well kept up, new windows and doors, its not drafty at all. \n\nHe has kidney disease and is on dialysis. Kidney disease causes anemia, which means you produce less red blood cells, your body has less energy to burn, so you don't produce as much body heat. So he has a legit reason for feeling cold, but he's also on a limited income and needs to get his electric bill under control.\n\nObviously we can put the electric bill on one of those plans where they average it out over the year, but he'd still be paying more, just spread out.\n\nBeyond the obvious of \"wear more clothes\" and \"stop leaving your front door open and just having the storm door closed so you can see which of your neighbors are coming and going\" any other advice or suggestions on keeping it warmer for cheaper would be helpful.",

I keep the window on that room open most of the time, but I still have these issues.\n\nI don't have room for a dryer, but I'd still like to be able to dry clothes inside. I considered getting a dehumidifier with a dry laundry mode, but in my country those cost +100€ and I don't want to pay that much. I also thought about guying a small dehumidifier but I'm not sure if it will work. I also considered a heated clothesline but once again I'm not sure if it will work.\n\nMy goal is not to fully dry the clothes and I'm OK if I need to have the clothes hanging inside for 1/2 days, I just want to speed up the drying and avoid the humidity and the musty smell.\n\nSo I wanted to ask, what are my options? I really don't have room for a dryer and I need something that doesn't take up a lot of space or can be tucked away somewhere when not in use.\n\nThank you in advance!",
