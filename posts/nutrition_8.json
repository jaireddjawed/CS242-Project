I'm just wondering if there's anything negative that eating 1lb of ground beef every day would cause, assuming it's part of a complete, healthy diet. I've heard that there are studies that link red meat and cancer but from what I can tell there are none that distinguish between someone eating ground beef or ground pork and someone eating bacon and McDonalds, which at least to me makes them useless.

But, do the air fryer fries generate any harmful chemicals like AGEs? If so, is that enough to offset the fiber benefit in this case? There is also the question of other nutrients.",
