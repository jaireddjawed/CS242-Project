The reason why i tried it is because i randomly stood in front of the mirror and saw my pulse on my throat so i pressed it( im not mentally unstable in anyway). After a few seconds i dropped on my knees and my body felt like there were stars shooting around in it. I did it a few times again and noticed it is fun and makes me feel like i took some psychedelics. Is it bad to do so, and what actually happens while you feel like you’re in a dream?",

How exactly does expecting to be cured of cancer make the cancer cells vanish? (Read about a famous case where a placebo pill cured a man's terminal cancer, simply because he believed it would cure him)\n\nIf this isn't paranormal/ESP/psychic phenomena does anyone have a better explanation of how expecting something makes something come true?\n\nThe placebo effect sounds like literal magic. Like, someone takes a pill, scientist says ''this will make you grow wings'' and then that person actually starts to grow wings just because they expect it? How tf does that even work?\n\nI know ''the mind is powerful'' but we're talking about thoughts affecting systems unrelated to processes involving thinking. How's that any different from thoughts making things move around or float (telekinesis)?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/10la7ql/why_arent_placebo_epipens_used_for_allergies_if/",
        "text": "I read about a study on Psychology Today about the placebo effect. People who were allergic to nuts were given a powder. Some of them were told that the powder did not contain nuts. They ate the powder, and they did not have a reaction, even though the powder contained nuts. They did not have a reaction as they expected not to have one. Their blood levels of histamine were checked. No histamine was released.\n\nThe others were told the powder contains nuts and when they ate the powder, they had a reaction since they expected to have one, even though this powder did not contain nuts. Their blood levels of histamine were checked. They had a significant, measurable histamine reaction because they expected to have one.\n\n**Most importantly, what this study showed is that when nut-allergic people were expecting NOT to have a reaction, they didn't - even if they ingested the allergen. Their brains told the immune system ''everything is clear'', so to speak. This is proof that the brain has direct control over allergic reactions and the immune system.**\n\nThe immune system and the brain are connected (look into Pavlovian conditioned immune responses for more on that). If the brain thinks it has taken adrenaline, it will stop the allergic reaction. The Epi-Pen would only contain water, but would say it contains adrenaline. Also, they'd be much cheaper and easier to get.\n\nAlso, couldn't a person be given a (placebo) pill, where they are told ''this pill will cure your allergy''? They would not be told the pill is only a placebo. Since their brain would be convinced the allergy is cured, wouldn't that mean they'd no longer have an allergic reaction to the allergen (since the brain and the immune system communicate with eachother)? \n\nThe power of suggestion is a powerful thing.",
