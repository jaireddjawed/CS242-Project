        "text": "My name is Kerry Waananen and I'm an aspiring/quasi-Cyborg Anthropologist Undergraduate. I'm leaving in a month to study Chinese Cell Phone Culture (CCPC) in Chengdu, China. While I have found a few source materials to model my research methods after, a vast majority of them are not under an anthropological lens. Cell Phone Culture, in my experience, is generally filed under sociology and/or media studies. I've found the two most notable Digital Anthropology ethnographies interesting, albeit dry - I guess I'm trying to innovate/challenge the analog ethnographic presentation format a la book.\n\nAny/all works I have found as examples (cell phone culture, chinese cell phone culture) are dated and decidedly no longer all that relevant. As technology and culture speeds ahead (a cyborg marriage), something written a few years ago becomes quickly dispensable. I have not found any examples of Cyborg Anthropology application other than conceptual talks or literature. That is to say, I have found no examples of anyone using Cyborg Anthropology Theory to create anything. It's my attempt to create the first(?) Cyborg Anthropological Ethnography, thing is, how do I do that when I have no model? I guess that's what I'm going to have to figure out. And that's why I'm here.\n\nMy belief of cyborg/modern experimental ethnography needs to be an emulation of an experience, not merely a dry text full of numbers, figures, interviews, and quantifications of qualifications. That is to say, my imagined application of a CyAn ethnography of CCPC would have to be something experienced through multimedia means. [An example of this is an \"experimental ethnography\" a colleague and I attempted this spring.](http://heterotopiajournal.weebly.com/publications/urban-ethnographies-by-lenaig-delisle-and-kerry-waananen) (play the soundtrack while reading the ethnography.) In my definition of \"emulated experience presentation\" could directly transfer to AR or VR, but that's getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe goal of my research is to not only create a documentation of the phenomenology of a specific topic within space/time, but also to work as collaboratively as possible with the \"hive-mind\" of anthropologists on the internet (in this sense, as Amber Case has claimed, we are all cyborgs.)\n\nAny and all advice is massively appreciated, as I sort am feeling over my head. :)\n\n[Edited for clarity]",

The idea that one person's actions can have repercussions on a whole group (the family or even tribal unit) and so the individual needs to pay the consequence for the harm inflicted on the collective. \n\nBut if I take a step back, it appears that this isn't a case of individuals (the murderers) doing what's best for the collective. rather, it's a case of individuals doing what's best for them, at the expense of someone weaker and vulnerable. It's hard to see such actions as collectivist when it preys on the societally weak/vulnerable, such as women, children, LGBT individuals, etc. Rather, it appears that these actions are only condoned under a facade of collectivism (\"this is the only way we can spare the entire family the shame of this action\") but in reality are a manifestation of powerful individuals preying on weaker individuals. And so such societies are just as \"individualistic\" as the West they like to criticize. \n\nObviously this is an extreme example, but even lets say in things like forced marriages where individuals lose by suffering through an unhappy marriage and the winners are the parents, who gain societal status, wealth, or what have you. When is a society truly behaving in a collectivist way and when is collectivism only used as a facade to trod on the rights of societally weaker individuals?",

        "text": "Disclaimer: this is not a race bait or whatever, I am simply curious. \n\nAshkenazi Jews have an average IQ of 115, which is 1 SD higher than the average. Blacks in the US have an average IQ of 85, 1 SD lower than the average. Why then do researchers try to understand Ashkenazi Jewish IQ from a genetic perspective, while the main focus in understanding Black IQ is environmental/social?\n\nLooking at Ashkenazi Jewish IQ, we can actually see that socioeconomic status plays a significant role in their IQ. That is, [Ashkenazi Jews studying in the poorest London schools had IQs equivalent to the non-Jewish populations](http://harpending.humanevo.utah.edu/documents/ashkiq.webpub.pdf). Which would actually be lower than the Ashkenazi Jewish IQ, but still higher than what you would expect from poor students. So we can probably see the detrimental effects of low socioeconomic class on IQ. \n\nHowever, this still doesn't explain the difference in approaching the study of IQ between Ashkenazi Jews and Blacks in the US. Even when controlling for education, [blacks in the US still have lower IQs](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf). \n\nSo what's up? Why in one case the focus is on deterministic factors, and in the other it is on semi random ones? This is what I want to understand - the discrepancy in which explanation best suits a certain deviation from normality in a certain minority. ",

Do you work in a “team” or “independent” environment? How does this style impact your work (meaning, working with others can be challenging, supportive, helpful, frustrating and working independently can be lonely, empowering, difficult?)\n\n4.

I'm taking a mythology class right now and the teacher seems to be big on noticing how some stories were decontexualized. Apparently this point of view goes back to The Golden Bough by James Frazer, which is a seminal work that is nevertheless looked down on by modern day professionals. Is this comparable to how psychologists have moved past Freud because he was too narratological, or is The Golden Bough closer to the pulp science of  Kon-Tiki?\n\n(Ignore 7 if you want.

        "text": "This question requires a fair bit of explanation, so I hope you'll bare with me and not pass this over. For starters, I'm functioning with the dictionary definition of morality here: \"the extent to which any given action is right or wrong\". I've often heard two opposing viewpoints on the role of universal morality in the human experience espoused by arguing dogmatists, skeptics, and all in between. There are those who say that morality must be subjective and fluid, because different cultures throughout the past have had widely disparate conceptions of morality and what is fair and just. Aside from things that might just seem biologically obvious, such as unprovoked murder, there is sufficient fluidity in the moralities of different cultures for these people to refute the existence of any universal and objective morality. Perhaps quite intuitively, the other camp holds that any fluidity in the moralities of different cultures is largely trivial, and that the core of all human moralities can be seen as essentially uniform and objective: a universally understood standard of concept that we cannot escape. \n\nSo my question for this subreddit is: where does the anthropological evidence point? I'm not asking you to resolve the nature of morality, just more simply, in your qualified eyes, are the different moralities of disparate human cultures fluid enough to be accurately seen as subjective; or uniform enough, with only trivial inconsistencies, to be seen as uniform and objective?",

Which seems to me to imply that the humans that eventually left Africa were smarter, better equipped, and perhaps even more evolved than those who stayed. Which, I want to make clear, I absolutely do not believe. But, I also don't think the people who made this show were meaning to get that message across either... I mean, I've heard this before... that as humans evolved, they made their way out of Africa and spread world wide. It just suddenly is beginning to bother me because of the possible implications.

I'm coming from polisci so most researches I did was quantitative researches and a few qualitative - only limited to short interviews and literature reading too. I've never done the participation observation methods; what should I prepare?\n\nAlso, what should I read for preliminary reading? My undergrad thesis was about religion and nationalism and my thesis adviser was an anthro prof, so I know a bit about works of Geertz (of course), Durkheim, WC Smith, Talal Asad, Ben Anderson. I'm not exactly clueless, but I won't say I'm most familiar either; e.g. I'm still confused about Levi-Strauss.\n\nMuch appreciated for the help!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I'm applying for socio-cultural anthro.\n\nEdit 2: why is this downvoted? o_O Is it because of mentioning names?

According to wikipedia, average height in South Korea is around 5 cm shorter for both males and females, although interestingly, North Korea is even slightly shorter than that (presumably because of lack of food). In fact, according to wikipedia average male heights vary as much as 15-20 cm from the tallest and shortest countries.\n\nWhy does the difference in height exist? I noticed older people (anyone over 40) are generally much shorter than the younger generations (which are near western height, as far as I can tell). I commonly see older people who are more like 140-150 cm. This suggests it's just a difference in culture and upbringing, so perhaps differences in diets? At least nowadays, Koreans eat a lot of meat, probably as much as in the UK, but perhaps it wasn't always the case. Anyway, I don't know.",

I was collecting little bits of trash that routinely wash up along a small stretch of river in the Catskills region of NY, USA, and spied them just slightly sticking out of an actively eroding section of riverbank. From above, they would have been buried about 1-2 ft if you'd been digging down. I think this particular section was probably about 5 ft in(horizontally) from the actual bank for at least a good few decades, prior to heavy storm damage starting ~5yrs ago.\n\nThere were two scraps that were in pretty rough shape, heavily desiccated and if not for sporting a neat row of stitching holes, easily mistaken for large dried leaves. My best guess was, some sort of moccasin type shoe. They seemed crude enough to be older than the region's \"recent\" history of Jewish hotels going boom/bust in the mid 20th century, but I'd be hard pressed to speculate much more beyond that. Something leftover from the earlier logging industry? Maybe someone collecting beaver pelts even earlier than that stepped in some mud and went shoeless for it? \n\nAt the time I thought it was mildly more interesting than the other modern trash I'd collected, but in hindsight, that seemed rather deep considering soil takes its time. But my attempts to bone up on that sort of thing have left me with a vague impression of \"maybe a few decades\" to \"probably longer than humans have been in North America\". So, it would be nice to narrow down the guessing range. Maybe more will turn up later in the storm season! I'd be happy to follow up with some pictures of the particular spot if that would lead to a more definite answer than my admittedly poor documentation here can imply.",

Which made me wonder: do other cultures where polygyny is practiced tend to have a low ratio of men to women due to warfare? In cultures where the ratio is closer to 1:1 (Mormons in the US, for example), are the leftover men offered some kind of consolation prize, or do they tend to accept their wifelessness peacefully, or is there fighting over the issue? I've seen fiction where they raid neighboring communities for women, but I have no idea if that happens in real life.

This is the critical part: this is a 100% chance of extinction; not \"probable\", not \"very likely\", it's an absolute unquestionable certainty that unless someone from the outside world interferes they will all die. \n\n\nWould it be ethical (or professional or acceptable or whatever) to act to prevent the disaster if it could be done in such a way that the uncontacted people were not aware of your actions?\n\n\nWhat about if it could be done, but it would result in the uncontacted people gaining knowledge that the outside world exists, that it's full of people with very different cultural and ethnic/racial makeups, and that these people have a much more complex level of technology?\n\n\nBasically, would contaminating their culture be disastrous enough that they would all be better off dead? Or maybe it's that there's a hard policy that we don't interfere with uncontacted peoples, and sometimes that has unfortunate side effects, but it's still hard policy to not interfere with these peoples? Is there some sort of consensus in the anthropologist community on situations like this?\n\nIf anyone cares at all, this is a question that came from I discussion I was having with someone about Star Trek's Prime Directive. In that show, the position is taken that it's better to let uncontacted people die then contaminate their cultures. I wanted to compare that to what happens in the real world. \n\n\nedit: I'm aware that uncontacted peoples are vulnerable to diseases, so you could add \"increase risks of infection\" to the potential problems in the second scenario.

        "text": "I have seen anti imperialists (arguably Marxists) argue that mimicry is a way to force the other to embrace the colonizer as a means of soft power. I have seen visual anthropologists get mad that recreating a style of film or photograph means asserting a western gaze. And the functional or diffusionism would suggest this was a matter of environment meets ingenuity. So what is the hang up in our post modern? Why is it a sin to create material objects that seem to replicate a method that works? \n\n(Sorry this is a bit of a rant but I do not see why we are so concerned about 'mimicry' when it seems from a defusionist, Marxist, functionalist view as a near inherent part of humanity. Maybe not the best part of humanity but please help me come to terms with this).",
