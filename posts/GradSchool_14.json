        "text": "So this is my second admissions cycle applying to MA and Ph.D. programs. I was accepted to a couple of programs last year but didn't receive enough funding, so did not enroll. I've mostly decided that I won't go through another cycle if I don't get enough funding this year because the rest of my life has been in limbo while trying to determine if I'm moving/departing from my LTR/etc. I could change my mind after a week of good rest but who knows when that will be.\n\nPart of me also feels so tired from the whole process. I work full time and was taking classes part-time for a number of years and then doing all of this freelance work to build my CV *and then* working on my application materials. I've been extremely lucky in that I did very well in my classes and also had a ton of opportunities come my way. I love learning and researching so much, and wish to be doing it full-time instead of splitting my efforts. I've already been through a 1-year grad program, and know how intense that year was. The work itself doesn't phase me since I'm used to working 50 - 60 hours a week between my job and whatever else I get myself into. Okay, I'm a bit of a workaholic. And I am legitimately tired. \n\nI also feel like I am stumbling through the admissions process even though I had some guidance (non-profit program for underserved students). The admissions process is not intuitive and sometimes I feel like a deer in headlights, and I spend days cringing over a wrong step. Anyone else?",

I found a graduate advisor originally with a really cool research project, that would allow full funding + international travel and possible international conferences. I was super excited and was lucky I didn't have to change schools as right now me and my family just can't afford for me to move. I got admitted into the program as well, directly notified by the department's graduate director just last weekend. However, like 4 days after I got admitted, she emailed me and told me that she's moving to Reno (UNR). I'm just.... panicking as it's all the way across the country and worried that even if I did go there, that I'd get burnt out on academia and have a school I never really wanted to go to on my resume and regret it.\n\nSince the original department said I was accepted, is it possible for them to place me with a different advisor? I contacted the graduate director of course, but has something similar happened to others? There are a couple with relevant research interests to mine still, but I'm just so bummed out on this amazing opportunity being lost. The school even had the study abroad program set up for the international trip since undergraduates were supposed to assist us at one point. Like an idiot, I only applied to one other program since the advisor assured me I would be accepted and that everything would be fine when I discussed with her.",

The graduate school I am planning to go to is also in Indiana. However, once I graduate in May I am moving to California (my MA program is 100% online). My university says residency status is determined by what your home address is for 12 consecutive months prior to the start of classes, but I will have had home addresses in two separate states by that point. So I am unsure if I will be paying in or out of state tuition fees. If anyone has been through a similar situation I would really like some insight on this issue! Thanks in advance :)",

In my time as a student I really loved learning Japanese. I got to a pretty solid level with the language and plan to keep studying and improving. I recently have been interested in becoming a university level professor at home or abroad. I’m also open to other paths as well, and I should mention I’m a non-traditional student so I am a bit older than a regular Senior undergrad. I do really enjoy the academic atmosphere that college gives me, and the feeling of self-esteem I have gotten from it. I have a couple questions though because I feel absolutely clueless on what to do next:\n\nHow does someone become a professor? Can I get into grad school if my gpa is around 2.75 but my major’s classes were all A’s and B’s? Is Grad School in Japan an option? What was the process like for you and did you find your grad school experience worthwhile?\n\nI apologize if these questions are stupid I just don’t have many people who went to college in my family, and with graduation getting closer I am feeling more anxiety lately.

They just opened their lab late last year and are still in the process of getting everything up and running. I am very interested in their work and get along with them really well so far. Here's how I see it:\n\nPros - close working relationship with the professor, a chance to establish the lab culture, can optimize the work flow to best suit my needs, large degree of creative/intellectual input, experience setting up a lab as I want to be a PI in the future, exposure to all the procedures/methods in the lab (could be a blessing and a curse). \n\nCons - will need to do a lot of the leg work getting everything up and running, I've heard it can be difficult to be published if your advisors aren't well known, Similarly I've heard getting funding can be difficult, more of a risk as they've never had a grad student before (although they said they've mentored multiple students when they were a post-doc). \n\nFor context I'm in a STEM program. I feel like I can see the pros and cons but I don't have the experience to know how great the pros are and how badly the cons suck. \n\nAny advice, anecdotes, or pros/cons that I missed would be really helpful.",

I've been pretty anxious about it leading up to this point but I've been trying to just write as much as I can to get my thoughts out. Recently I've been having some issues with my mental health (I have depression, woohoo) so I've been thinking about reaching out to my thesis director (whom I trust and has been nothing but kind) to ask for any advice or thoughts on dealing with this kind of thing in academia. But today I had the following interaction that gave me some pause.\n\nEvery year the department at my university picks a current grad student to sit in on departmental meetings and offer any insight that may be overlooked.  Basically everyone expresses interest in the role, including myself, but a friend of mine got the position for the 2022-2023 academic year. She doesn't typically share what's talked about in the meetings but today she was so frustrated that she kind of blurted out what had happened. Apparently the topic of discussion was mental health and multiple professors stated that students will \"claim\" mental health issues so that they don't have to work. These sentiments were repeated and agreed upon by various professors, one going so far as to say that mental health didn't exist. I've taken courses with each professor that spoke up and was pretty disappointed to hear their comments, but the one who claimed that mental health in general was a sham was someone that I had admired for being so honest about mental health in class. (Side note: this professor *is not* my thesis director.)\n\nNow that I know this, I feel incredibly torn on whether or not I should reach out to my director. I often worry about being pitied or seen as too sensitive which is why I never talk to professors about any struggles I'm having. I guess it just feels especially bad that the moment I finally lean into asking for some advice I learn that these are the things being said behind closed doors. All in all, I'm looking to see if anyone has any experience with this or recommendations on the situation. Also, if you're a professor I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nTLDR; I wanted to ask my thesis director for guidance on dealing with mental health in the field but found out that the department has pretty negative views on this sort of thing.",

[Deep Springs](https://www.deepsprings.edu/) \\- a ranch in middle-of-nowhere Nevada where classes of around 15 (I think) students run the farm and study together in tiny seminars\n2. [St. John's College](https://www.sjc.edu/) \\- a small liberal arts school (with campuses in Maryland and New Mexico) whose curriculum is based on reading great books from history in chronological order\n3. [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) \\- a nomadic school in which an international cohort of students travels together from one city to another, spending each semester in a new city.\n\nI am now applying to graduate schools, and I don't want to make the same mistake I did as an undergraduate. So I want to ask, do people here know of any graduate programs in math or theoretical physics that are similarly heterodox? Programs that are based on small seminars, independent/free study, meaty discussion, possibly out in nature, or possibly with traveling cohorts?\n\nI know Minerva and St. John's have grad programs, but neither is in fields like math or physics.",

So following the colon I’d instead have something directed at the chapter or aspect of my work, like “historical context” or “environmental setting,” &amp;c. \n\nHowever now I’ll have nearly all the results and analysis finalized and can give a much more holistic presentation on my research. So my question is should my title for these presentations be the same as my written thesis?  I’m not sure what convention says or how others approach this, and I don’t really get this sort of guidance from my advisor. \n\nI guess secondarily, I’d be curious how y’all   present you thesis work in a presentation setting - if you have the time to cover the majority of your analysis or research, do you? Or do you focus on smaller portions with greater depth? I find I can really expand on any portion, but now I’m feeling it’d be useful for me to present it as a full idea.",

Although I got a few offers, I wasn't really in a position to be all that picky, so I accepted. \n\nUnfortunately, I've been really frustrated with the program as the vast majority of the courses are taught by one professor that's clearly phoning it in. While I don't believe that classes necessarily have to be rigorous to be valuable, none of the coursework has felt worthwhile at all. There are also very limited networking opportunities, which is kind of the bread-and-butter of the sports industry. However, the work that I'm doing as a GA is exactly the work I want to do for a career and I've developed a really solid relationship with my boss. While my boss is not all that well-connected to the industry outside our particular school, I feel like he'd help me as much as he could with my future job search. \n\nHas anyone else ever been in a similar situation?

She sends me my mail to wherever I am at the moment (God bless her).\n\nBut I’m lookin to get serious, point my arrow at a subject…. And get cheap tuition that won’t leave me wounded financially. Ive got Americorps money wasting away but I wanna make it go far. \n\nIs it a fairly simple process to become resident of another state, say Oregon or California?\n I have family and good friends here who I know would let me use their address. If I got in, for example for OSU, I’d likely room with them too. It’d be simple to get bank statements or W-2s redirected. Change my car registration, the works. I was planning to get this in order and to “live” out the year and then start applying to my ideal schools the following year. (I’m looking at Fire or rangeland ecology most likely… fire adjacent stuff). \n\nJust wondering if anyone has done this or been in a similar situation. How hard was it? Was it worth it? Are they truly diving deep to discern how real a resident you are? \nPart of my worry was because of my seasonal work, I’m jumping states every 3-5 months, ranging from Alaska to Mississippi.\n My job history/true living situation shows houselessness.

There is a culture in my department of people “replying all” to emails, even when it’s very unnecessary. Sometimes I get a string of ~10 emails in a row congratulating someone on an award because everyone will reply all to the entire email thread rather than reaching out individually (which seems more genuine to me).

Since I haven't been in school for a while and lack research from my undergrad years, I am aiming to get into a master's program first to gain research experience and then a PhD program if all goes well.\n\nI am freaking out a little bit because I have one, just gotten rejected from my top (mid-tier) choice, but two, I did get accepted by my last choice at a rather low-tier program, which has also given me full funding and an assistantship though!\n\nI wish I had the confidence to shoot higher right now, so I only applied to a few mid-tier schools and two lower tier schools. I am still waiting to hear back from a couple schools, but after being rejected today I'm kind of worried about my qualifications. I am so glad to have gotten at least one solid acceptance so far, but I was recently told that such a low-tier program likely isn't worth it or might not ultimately help me shoot higher for my PhD program.\n\nAm I going to regret accepting this offer? Is a lower-tier program actually going jeopardize my ability to get into a better PhD program? I'm mostly glad to have an offer and funding, but now I am feeling like maybe I'm not qualified or that even taking this offer won't help me become qualified enough for a phd....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: just adding that I am located in the United States. Waiting to hear back from one school that's ranked around 50, but the funded program in question is not even ranked in the top 100s. If I get rejected from this other school I'll obviously take this offer, but its been hinted at a few times recently that I should go with the better program regardless.",

I had a good application and a lot of experience and I feel like my chances are about 50/50 because it’s so random to win.\n\nHere’s the thing. My dad died in July unexpectedly and traumatically. I don’t think the grief had totally hit me when I decided to apply, or maybe it was that I thought I’d be fine by the time my PhD program started. Well, I’m not doing well. It’s weighing on me heavily and I’m struggling to even begin writing my thesis for my MS. I have no drive or passion for it anymore and honestly would be perfectly happy just dropping out completely. My mom is worse off and I’m trying my best to be there for her. Now her dad (my grandpa) is currently on his deathbed and not expected to survive the day.\n\nTo add to this, I found out I was pregnant immediately after applying. I’m due mid July with my first, which is 1 month before the PhD program would start. The NSF fellowship is pretty strict, I think I can get medical leave for a short amount of time but with postpartum exhaustion I just don’t know if it will be the right move for me, baby, my husband, or our finances due to childcare.\n\nI just don’t think I have it in me to do this. My husband makes good money, and I just want to stay home for a while and find a job I like on my terms, whether it be a few months or a few years. My soul is tired.\n\nIf I’m awarded the fellowship I’m going to put so much pressure on myself and feel guilty if I don’t take it. It’s such a big opportunity and will allow me to go to a local ivy leave school in an amazing lab with an amazing advisor. For that reason I hope the choice is taken away from me and I don’t win.\n\nAnother thing, I don’t want to let others down. I know when I put my mind to something I’m an extremely good student and researcher. Professors and mentors have acknowledged that, and want to see me succeed almost to the point of pressuring me. They wrote my recommendation letters. I know NSF posts the winners each year, does this mean my recommendation letter writers would be able to see that I turned it down? I don’t want them to lose faith in me, especially if I ever need a letter for something again.",

Especially in math and physics. And not just for \"research\", but also for learning fundamentals in a discipline.\n\nI have this fantasy about an education system that is completely based on self-guided study. Instead of lecture-based courses, people study independently or in freely-forming groups. Of course, I don't mean a system where students are totally isolated, I imagine that students would spend a lot of time talking to peers and mentors about questions and ideas. What I object to is standardized curricula, and even to an extent standardized courses, which limit the ability of students to generate questions and pursue them freely.\n\nI think there's a particular need for such a place for early-graduate studies in math and theoretical physics, since humanities programs may already be a bit like this. Especially now that so much information is freely available, and interdisciplinary studies are growing in importance, I think this model is both feasible and needed.\n\nPeople sometimes recommend \"research master's\" or PhDs. These do have this quality, too. But research is about generating new knowledge, and I hope that the system I describe could apply even to those students still working on learning the foundations in their area, and to students in the first couple years of a (US-style) PhD.\n\nI imagine almost a monastery with students and professors, where each person is free to pursue the topics that beckon them, where professors are available to answer questions, and mutual aid between peers is emphasized. Sort of how I imagine Plato's academy might have been (though I don't really have a clue how it actually was). The antithesis of factory school.",

After the conference, I was informed I was going to get paid around 1k for organising the workshop, which came as a surprise.\n\nI have just received a 1099-NEC with said payment. This made me realize this may constitute a violation of my F1 status. I thought this was going to be a payment similar to a grant or an award, which I have received in the past without any issue.\n\nAm I in trouble? And most importantly, is there a way I can get out of trouble? Can I return the money? It is my hope to remain in the USA as a postdoc after my PhD, and I am very concerned about the implications of this for my status renewal.\n\nThank you so much!",

I have several papers, a couple of funded NIH grants, and a lot of experience with science communication. But I can't shake the fear that I only know useless skills, that I'm unlikable, and that I haven't received enough technical training to be very useful anywhere. \n\nI just learned that my good friend only applied for a whopping two jobs before getting her dream job, and I just don't think the same thing will happen for me. I'm so anxious that I think I'm starting to drive my friends and family crazy, and I just don't feel like anyone will take me seriously. \n\nThe economy is getting worse and worse, I live in a city that is decent for biotech (but not amazing) and my advisor seems sort of pissed that I'm graduating instead of working for her as a graduate student forever. How can I get my shit together to actually land a job? I've applied for a job and an internship within the past week, but realistically I know I should probably plan to apply to dozens (if not hundreds) of places before I'm offered a position, and I am just not seeing enough positions that I think I'd be qualified for, to even try.",

        "text": "I consider myself an ambitious person but I am easily prone to stress. I was a bright student in school (or as I consider myself to be). I had the ambition of getting into IITs. Couldn't make it there. Got into a decent college but not into the major of my choice. I was not happy for some time and even felt at times that I won't be able to get a good job but somehow got into a good software company despite being a non-CS major. I was feeling good at that time since finally I had reached where I wanted to be.\n\nAt my job, it was good for some time but then the struggle started. I felt not appreciated at work. I was not given good work. I then decided to pursue a graduate degree and started preparing my profile. I had so many things in mind. Tried a lot to collaborate with people and work on some interesting projects/research but couldn't bring anything to completion. Took GRE, didn't get the score I wanted. Nevertheless, applied to universities in the hope of getting into not the top but decent ones. Got into a university which was kind of pretty low on my list. \n\nTo avoid the hassle of getting LORs again, I decided to go to the university and make the best use of it. Before coming here, I had so many things on my mind - internship, teaching assistant job, research assistantship but now when I look at it, I haven't been able to crack a single thing. Sometimes, I don't understand how people manage studies with so many things - getting a good GPA, getting internships, on-campus jobs, travelling around, relationships, and following hobbies. I am not even able to manage a single thing. Looking back it feels like I am transitioning from a good to a dull student. I wasn't this dull before. \n\nNeed advice on how you guys manage everything. Any help will be appreciated!",
