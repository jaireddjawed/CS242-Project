        "text": "Hey guys! So I know a lot of people often ask questions about what CS school to attend, how to transition into the CS field, but I have (what I believe) to be a bit of an unusual situation that I'm hoping to get some guidance on. So I've got my B.Sc's in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering and received my MBA a few years back. I've been playing the corporate game for some time now and have been doing well... But I've always wanted to start my own business. I can obviously stay in my lane, but an opportunity has come up that I think I'd like to take advantage of.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nA friend of mine is a Software Engineer who is also getting burnt out by the corporate world and has a little side business working on various small projects each year - mostly creating software tailored to a particular client's needs (an example was a local construction contractor hired him to develop an automated system which would schedule and contact personnel based on the specific type of work that was required). After some discussion, we are considering expanding this business and if we get a fair number of new clients, may switch to this operation full time. We would obviously maintain our current job roles until we had more certainty that this new venture would be something that could support us and grow.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThrough the various jobs and research roles I've had throughout my career thus far I've had a fair amount of what I will consider \"patchwork programming\". I've had to learn a little Python, for example, but only to reach an end. I've worked quite a bit with microcontrollers and the associated programming languages with them. However, I can't help but feel that I lack a true foundation in CS. If I am to join a new venture with someone, even a friend, I insist that I be playing with a full deck; I won't be our primary developer, but I want to be able to feel comfortable with what we are working on. So, my question to you fine folks... What would you recommend as a program/path forward to get a firm foundation in CS? I would love to go back to school for four years for the whole experience, but that really isn't an option right now. I read quite a bit about OSU's online program which I'd be eligible for given my degrees but I think it might be unnecessary given my goals here (I don't really need the degree, just the skill set). Is there anything out there that offers as comprehensive a program? I know services like EDX have a class here and there but I don't think they offer anything as encompassing as what I am looking for. I want to stress that I am not necessarily looking to become an expert in one particular language of programming, but trying to build that larger knowledge base (perhaps specialize later?). If anyone can provide some advice here I'd really appreciate it. Thanks so much!",

        "text": "[Bus sniffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_sniffing) is used to maintain cache coherency. As I understand it, each CPU cache has its own controller which monitors reads and writes which are sent over the data bus from and to main memory, respectively.\n\nThere are situations where a single address may be stored individually in separate caches; as such, there is the possibility that one cache may receive an update from a corresponding write, and bus sniffing is a method which is used to ensure that all other caches which contain the address in question will also be updated according to the new value which is written.\n\nSay, for example, we have the address 01, which contains the value x. Caches A and B have both loaded actual cache lines previously which contained the address 01, and therefore are aware that 01's address does indeed have x written to its \"cell\". Because of this, both copies for address 01 have a flag known as \"shared\" set to 1.\n\nLet's also say that a current write is about to be performed to address 01, in which the new value to be written to that location will by y. If a cache line from cache A is currently loaded, that contains address 01, the CPU will write to the address using that cache, and set A's \"dirty\" flag for address 01 to 1. Consequently, B's controller will be aware of this given that it monitors data which is sent across from the bus; it's aware that a write was about to take place, and since no actual data has been sent across the bus at all (else it would have gone to main memory), it changes B's flag for address 01 from \"valid\" flag from 1 to 0. Since A's value was set to dirty, its valid flag remains 1, however its *shared* flag becomes 0, given that its dirty flag was recently set. Likewise, since B's valid flag was set to 0, its shared flag also becomes 0 given that B's controller is aware that its copy of address 01 should no longer contain the value x. \n\nLet's say that a certain instruction is executed later on in some other subroutine which hopes to read a value from address 01. This results in a legitimate cache miss, since neither A's line or B's line contain the address 01. While the read is forced to go to main memory, and therefore is still slower than it would be when reading from the cache, both cache controllers are aware that there is a miss; in this case, the controller for cache A sets its dirty flag to 0, but maintains its \"valid\" state since there hasn't been any write to it that's changed it from its current value y; since cache B initially had an invalid entry, it remains in an invalid state, but will update its copy of address 01's value when its loaded cache line actually contains address 01.\n\nIs my understanding of this correct, given the example I've illustrated? Any help would be appreciated :D",

But i feel as if I haven't learned as much as i should have so far.\n\n\n**Here's what I know so far**: Programming in Java, calculations of Algorithms and Designing algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Knuth-Morris Pratt algoritm, algorithm complexity etc.), manipulating data structures, computer organization (Binary numbers, ALU's, Logic Gates, Assemblers, Compilers, but weak in this area), and a bit of knowledge in several paradigms (such as parallelism, heuristics, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms).\n\n\nAnd thats about it. The information is very useful, and I love learning new things about anything related to the Science of computers. I also see the importance of everything i've learned.\n\n\n**The problem**: I have absolutely no clue how i'd implement any of the things i've learned in the Real World. Every time i look at a real-world implementation of ANYTHING i've learned, it looks extremely difficult and out of my league. Am i speaking too soon? Will I \"mature\" and eventually and gradually learn everything i'll need to learn?\n\n\nI've been told that most of the learning will come when you get a job and are knee deep in work, and that the college level of CompSci is mostly introductory and theory. This doesn't sit well with me though, I want to push forward, and get a head start. What do I need to do? The logical thing is to pick the reigns up and start teaching myself and get my own experience. I just dont know where to start.\n\n\n**TL;DR** I feel incompetent with what i've learned so far in CS. Should I take action and learn more?\n\n\nLooking for any tips from experienced individuals both in Computer Science and other related fields.",

        "text": "Sorry not really sure what the right term is but whats the point of declaring a variable and not assigning a value like       var number; versus     var number = 5; just curious also is there a term for this? im learning javascript so if you could tell me why this would be handy in javascript i would appreciate it \n ",

        "text": "To the best of my knowledge, time complexity analysis always aims to quantify the (asymptotic) time requirements of an algorithm as a function of the size (in bits) of that algorithm's input. I've never come across any analysis that quantifies the running time using some other feature of the input besides its size, yet it seems to me like this could sometimes be appropriate.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a simple binary counter that just increments any integer we supply to it and returns the result. Clearly not every input to this counter will take the same amount of operations: the worst case for such a counter is to supply it an n bit integer where the first bit is set to 0 and all other bits are set to 1. The best case is an n bit integer where the least significant bit is zero. The former takes n operations, the latter only one. Of course, as is well known, a binary counter can be implemented such that any sequence of n increment operations takes ~~O(1)~~ O(n) amortized time, because the worst cases are very rare compared to the \"good\" cases.\n\nBut this example illustrates the basic idea behind my question: given that the number of operations an algorithm needs to perform can vary significantly for inputs of the same size, can it sometimes be appropriate to consider the running time as a function of some other feature of the input besides its size?",
