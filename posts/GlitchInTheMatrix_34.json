I took my phone out of my pocket and put it on my bed next to me and fell asleep. The next morning, I woke up and couldn't find my phone on my bed. I looked under the blanket, under my pillow, and wherever else I thought it would be, and couldn't find it, and I couldn't call it since I forgot to charge it and it died during the night. \n\nAfter I woke up, I sat against the foot of my bed and got on my laptop and drank an Arizona. A few minutes later, the empty can fell and I thought nothing of it. Then, it felt like my back vibrated, like a muscle spasm I guess. A couple of minutes after that, some change fell off my bed. As I went to pick it up, it had landed right on my phone, which was laying there on the floor. The weird coincidence about this is that the can was laying in the direction of my phone, and the spot on my back was straight in front of my phone. \n\nI just thought that was weird. ",

So, like a good boy, I got in my car and drove to my house for a good night's rest.\n\nNote: My car is a gift from my aunt, it came with 2 sets of keys. Not 1. Not 3. 2 sets. She and all of my family can confirm this.\n\nThe next day, my girlfriend calls me up: \"You forgot your keys at my house!\" I think nothing of it at first, and ask her to drop them off. Then she asked this: \"How did you get home then? You left the set with your car key on it.\"\n\nAt that moment, I remembered that my other set of keys was missing, misplaced by myself months prior. \n\nImmediately I walked over to the key rings in our kitchen, and picked through them. As I pulled multiple sets of keys aside, there was the spare set in the very back, and I had no idea they were there. With dust collected on them.\n\nThere was one set of keys at my residence, and I left the other at my girlfriend's place before I took off. \n\nI drove without keys to my car. My dad also drives a toyota, and none of his three sets of keys worked when I tried them. \n",

        "text": "This happened about a month ago at the end of semester. The fact that I count time by semester is probably a hint, but I am a grad student (PhD in math.) My focus has recently taken me more into the engineering world. I have fallen in love with fluids (haha I've heard the jokes before!) which is typically part of the mechanical engineering department / physics department. Fluids are amazing! If you never got to learn about this stuff in school (I didn't) just google some pictures about turbulent flow. You'll be hooked as well! The point is: I have a background in math. Purely, math. It has been quite the struggle for me to learn \"engineering speak.\"  And, it has been especially difficult when I've been assigned to TA (teacher assistant) engineering classes. \n\nSo, it's end of semester: my own course work is due, I have 104 students asking advice for their final projects, and my adviser probably thinks I'm dead since I'm too afraid to meet with him and say I've accomplished nothing (research-wise) in the past 2 weeks. So, possibly I can chalk this experience up to lack of sleep and stress. \n\nI run out of scrap paper. \n\n\nSo, I go hunting in my desk for a notebook that I've used in the past, but didn't fill up completely. I find one. BINGO! Open it up... and instantly get the chills. I find an \"Intent to Graduate\" form from the University that I got my Master's from... My MS in math. This form is from the mechanical engineering dept. It is saying that I intend to graduate as a Mechanical Engineering student. \n\n\nMy first thought is that I must've just collected someone else's paper as I was grabbing my stuff one day. But, on the opposite page of where this form had been tucked was a whole page of my handwriting listing out the courses I should take and the Profs that were teaching them to finish off the semester. I can upload pics, but I don't think that forms I filled in myself offer much proof. They were proof enough for me, though, to physically react. I really don't know why, but I just started shaking. I wish had a better explanation, but seeing this page of writing made me shake - not cry, not get mad, not feel really anything - just shake. \n\n\nThe \"funniest\" part is that I've had to TA one of the courses that I \"took\" - heat transfer. Let me tell you, I had never seen that material in my life. It was a hell of a semester! \n\n\nSo, I can't really tell you what this was. The strangest part is that I am currently trying to learn the courses this form says I've already taken. I don't know if this is glitch material, but I'm not sure what else to call it! Thanks!",

Immediately after she began to scream and cry, I jumped up and  asked what had happened..she said She had a dream a man  killed me and that she saw me dead in a room ..It was very strange her father and I are not together but we are still really good friends so it doesn't make sense to me.

I assumed that you were supposed to wear one on each foot, and switch, for some purpose. On May 15, I sent an email (still have the email) to the vendor, in response to his follow up asking how I liked the socks (probably automated), asking why the sleeves have two different patterns, and whether this was the intended usage. I told the vendor that I had thrown away the packaging (I had, when I received the socks), not realizing the socks would need instructions. The vendor never responded.\n\nI've been wearing the socks, and switching them, regularly since May 5. Just today, May 29, I saw that the socks have *the same pattern*.\n\nLogic wants me to chalk this up to just mis-seeing the socks - I have been known to be unobservant. But, I've been wearing these socks regularly for nearly a month now, so this seems weird. What do you think? Potential glitch in the matrix, or brain glitch?\n",

They take out everything but the 1 box of roach traps. They seal the box back up with a layer of tape making sure the tape they cut open lines up. \n\npic: http://imgur.com/kW9WzZd\n\nI was really hoping that the contents of the box just disappeared into a black hole instead of being stolen because this means that there are criminals working in our postal system. I don't even give a fuck about the phone or my dad's precious roach traps. I feel angry that this person is probably going to continue stealing mail and helpless because there's nothing I can do about it. ",

        "text": "I posted this in /r/self yesterday but did not get a response. Hopefully it'll fit here?\n\nEarlier this week my sister sent me a box of stuff through the USPS using a flat rate box. In the box, she put 6 boxes of cockroach traps (for my dad) and an iPhone 6 (for me). She taped it up and mailed it to me.\n\nYesterday I got a note in my mailbox telling me to pick up the package at the post office the next day.\n\nThis morning I went to the post office and received the box no problem. At the time I did not know my sister sent the roach traps. I thought I was just getting the phone. That being said, I noticed the box she sent was a quite large for just a phone but I just figured that the next size smaller box wouldn't fit. The box was also lighter than I expected but I hear the iPhone 6 is light so I thought nothing of it.\n\nI went to my car and opened the box by stabbing the tape with a pen. I get it open and to my surprise I see 1 box of roach traps and nothing else in the box.\n\nSo I call my sister and ask her if she was playing some joke and she asked me if *I* was joking. I go back inside the post office and tried to see what the fuck was up. I dealt with them for an hour and they were ultimately unhelpful.\nWhen my sister mailed the box, it was 3lb 5 oz. When I received the box it was 12 oz but did not look like it had been opened at all. It didn't look like anybody peeled any tape off or have any red flags.\n\nAt this point I'm thinking some black magic went on and I'm trying to figure out how someone could have removed most of the contents of the box without showing any evidence!\n\nHas anyone had anything similar happen to them or have some kind of explanation for this? It's killing me!!",

        "text": "Okay, so this happened only two weeks ago. I was severely sleep deprived, having worked night and day the past days (I'm a Python software dev just in case you're wondering), and that morning I missed breakfast because I was cramming a pretty substantial module. Anyways, 5am I started feeling a weird tingling sensation all over my skin, and it was the same feeling that I got as a kid when I would place my hand near the glass of a CRT tv (where the hairs would stand up). Moments later I felt a funny sensation in my abdomen, the same sensation you feel when you're on a roller coaster and suddenly the car reaches the peak and takes a sharp dive. I dismissed it then, and took a bath.\n\n6:30 I was on my way out of my house (my workplace is about an hour's commute from my place), and again I felt the same weird sensations. I dismissed them just as I did earlier, and continued walking.\n\n7:45 I just got out of the elevator at the 19th floor of my building, which our company rents. Just as I stepped out of the elevator I once again felt the same sensations, but this time much more intense to the point that my knees felt weak. It was a really odd sensation, I felt like my body was very heavy and I was plummeting down the floors like they weren't there, accelerating downwards. Weirdly I remember seeing through the floors and even saw my boss wave hello to the guard at the bottom floor near the basement parking. As soon as I passed basement 3 all I could see was blackness.\n\nAnd then a voice. There was a woman's voice I can't quite place but I instinctively knew I knew. I can't remember what she said though. There was also the aroma of cooking eggs and bacon, and I also smelled a perfume that also seemed familiar. Then slowly I remember a room coming into vision, it looked like my place but somehow different, like the wallpapers are more worn out and that there are some furniture I can't identify. Judging by the sun outside the window I'd say it was just around 5am. I remember standing up, walking out to the hallway and into the kitchen, and I saw a woman standing there probably the same age as me, and I felt like I knew her but I couldn't really place. And she said \"are you okay? do you want to call in sick? you look pale\" (or something like that) but I couldn't respond. I looked around the kitchen and saw a company-branded calendar (of a company I couldn't recognize, it was something like Xavex or Xavier, and logo was bright blue with wide fonts) hanging near the fridge, and imagine my shock when the page was on May 2018. Then I felt really really nauseous and I felt the weird pulling sensation in my stomach again and on my skin, and next thing I knew I was on the employee lounge lying on the couch and there were around seven people looking down at me around me and their voices came into focus \"hey man are you okay?\" \"hey you just passed out, take some rest.\" and so on. And my fingers and toes still felt tingly but it was vanishing.\n\nI took the next two days off to get a full physical at the local hospital and they said there wasn't anything wrong with me. No nerve damage, brain damage, and surprisingly my blood levels were borderline normal. I was told that I just needed sleep and more iron-rich food. The attending physician even referred me to a neuro at a downtown hospital and the prognosis was mostly just the same, that aside from being a bit sleep deprived there was nothing really wrong about me which could explain what happened. The doctors said that the tingling I felt was indicative of nerve damage but they did a series of tests which all came back negative. Till now what happened was unclear.\n\nNow, I dismissed all this thinking I had just a weird dream when I passed out or something, but imagine my surprise when last night I got a company memo via email preparing us for an acqui-hire with a company called XavexCom. Yep, fat fonts, striking blue logo. They're laying off half of the company in the merger but thankfully my department was mostly spared. Now I'm still curious about the woman that I saw in my vision and who might she be. I've never heard of XavexCom before nor could I have subconsciously heard about it or seen the logo anywhere because all my colleagues were just as surprised as I was when they learned of the new company. The email was the first instance I ever learned about XavexCom. The memo was what prompted me to believe that what I saw was a vision of the future and made me write this post.\n\n---\n\n**Tl;dr:** I was walking to my desk at the office, I felt a weird sensation and passed out. Slowly I woke up and in my house, but there were things that were off (like old-looking wallpapers, new furniture) and there was a woman in my house that felt really familiar but I didn't recognize. I saw a calendar of a company called XavexCom dated May 2018 in my kitchen, and suddenly I blacked out and woke up back at the office surrounded by colleagues. A week later I got an email memo informing me that our company was being acqui-hired by a company called -- guess what -- XavexCom. The email was the first instance I ever learned about XavexCom. The memo was what prompted me to believe that what I saw was a vision of the future and made me write this post.",

We missed the call because we were arguing but it has stuck with me since. As well as some other little things. I'm not sure if this is the right spot but it seemed like it could be.",

The last sign I recall seeing was for Sloan, NV,  which is a few minutes over the border, and it was about 3:30 in the morning. \n\nWe drove for what felt like hours. Neither of us spoke, it was like we were asleep or something. By the time we both snapped out of it, we were about 40 minutes outside Vegas, on the other side. We missed Vegas completely, saw no casinos, lights, hookers, nothing. It was 3:37.\n\nWe turned around, drove about forty minutes back in to town, making sure to be aware of every minute and try to figure out what had just happened. Aside from being in the middle of a lightning and thunder storm, we have no explanation. ",

Fast forward to when I was about 12 I see this preview for the first ep of this new show \"The Walking Dead\" and it's the exact same snip-its from the show I saw before. Any thoughts on how this could have happened? I remember talking about the show and no one knew what I was talking about but I do remember my dad saying how cool the ep was and how realistic the zombies looked.

I'm a big fan, so I clicked the link, and the song is a cover of \"And I Love Her\", a Beatles song. I'd never heard it, since I know very few Beatles songs (so shoot me). But the Kurt Cobain version of the song is what I'd been humming. I mean, I could have heard the Beatles version, and not recognized that I had heard it, but I was humming *this* version. All slow and strange, the way Kurt sings it. [Here's the article](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/kurt-cobain-beatles-cover-montage-of-heck/?fb=dd)\n\nI just listened to the original, and it sounds nothing like what I was humming. I mean, you can tell it's the same song, but it sounds completely different. Even the Beatles version sounds unfamiliar. Seeing as the article says that only person who had heard the cover was Kurt Cobain, and it was never released before now, how could I be humming a song that no one had ever heard before?",

I was very sad one night. I couldn't sleep nor settle down, all I could do was to cry into my pillow and think \"I don't want this anymore, make it stop, please let me go,let me go\". I guess I was asking to die, which is somewhat embarrassing for me to admit, but yes, at the time I was really sad and stressed. \n\nAt some point, I started to feel dizzy and my body felt somewhat to be spiralling (I was laid down). Then, my hands started to feel very light, next, my arms, etc, until it felt like my body was weightless. Like I was levitating and spiralling. I had my eyes closed at this point, because the feeling I was experiencing was....calming (?). My heart was not pounding anymore, it no longer felt heavy and hurt. I stopped crying without realizing it at the moment and all I could hear was a low constant \"piiii\" sound. I actually felt peaceful.\n\nNext thing I started to feel was that suddenly, I was aware of every atom surrounding me, and also, aware of my own atoms. It was like the entire air was buzzing with energy. I then started feeling my atoms, one by one leaving my body into the atmosphere. I was a very weird sensation. Like I was some sort of effervescent pill, dissolving into water. My heart started pounding again, I started to feel scared and opened my eyes, only to feel myself \"whole\" and \"real\" again (If this makes any sense).\n\nI never experienced anything like that again. I know for sure I was not sleeping and I never took any kind of drug that could change my perception. As I said, I was simply lying down, crying, and then all this sensations happened. They felt very real to me, actually they felt so real that I started to be scared I was actually disappearing into thin air, despite the illogical conditions of such situation. \n\nDid something similar to this ever happened to you?  \nAgain, sorry if this is not the right place, but I had to take the risk and share this experience. I'm very curious if there is an actual explanation for this type of events. \n ",

So this has happened to me twice.\nA few years ago, I was living in my old room (im 18 years old and still live in the same house, just a different room.) I shared the room at the time with my younger sister. I was laying in bed one night, and it was totally silent. Out of nowhere, from what sounded like it had come from under an object or possibly my closet, I hear a message tone, the kind you'd hear when an iPhone gets a text message. It sounded way too far away to be my phone, very distant actually. My sister hadn't budged, my phone had not lit up and I had no messages. Both of us had iPhones and I thought it could've just been a text, but it wasn't, as I would have seen her phone light up and she is a light sleeper, so she would have woken up. It also sounded further away than that. I slowly checked the closet, and there was nothing. I could've SWORN i was really hearing it. So fast forward a year or so and I'm laying in bed, in my own all new room. I have a new phone, an android. (The sounds they make for incoming messages are very different.) Its silent, and I hear the unmistakable iPhone incoming message noise again. Again it is distant, and somewhat light, and AGAIN, definitely not my phone. But I KNOW I heard it. It was nothing like a phantom vibration, which I know is common. The oddest thing was that it happened in both rooms. Each time I heard it, it sounded one time and did not repeat. Thoughts? I'm sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, or formatted poorly, as I am not a regular here. Thanks, guys!\n",

(I start trying to intentionally block the hypothetical light that's making the glow through the window)[http://imgur.com/W2nCNGzand] still nothing. I just stare at it and I notice its sort of moving in place and changing shape. I block the crack from the bottom of my door thinking that must be where its coming from but nope it just kept on glowing. At that point fear took over and I just hid under my blanket afraid to look over there I saw it again last night and I just couldn't shake this feeling of \"what the holy fuck is this thing\" and had to share.",

        "text": "So this happens to me often, enough to the point that I'm a little concerned now.\n\nI'll be dreaming and when I wake up, I'll remember the dream in vivid detail, which isn't something that happens to me a lot. Most of my dreams tend to be really weird and correspond with interests I have or things I've been watching recently (for example, if I had watched tons of videos of a certain youtuber before I went to sleep, I'd dream about that YouTuber.) That's how my dreams normally go.\n\nBut these \"dreams\" don't. I'll give you an example of one. I dreamt that I was at school in my English class, sitting next to a friend of mine. I look through my backpack and can't find a pen. I look over at her and ask, \"Do you have a pen?\" And she laughs and says, \"You can't keep asking me, Tory! You're gonna be an adult one day and you're gonna need a pen and I'm not gonna be there to give it you!\" And so I reply in a dramatic and fake crying voice, \"Fine! I'll just ask (other friend) if he has a pen! I don't need you!\" And that was the end of the dream. It was weird because I had no memory of that ever happening so I brushed it off.\n\nTwo weeks later, that \"dream\" happened in real life. Word for word. This isn't just a one time thing, either. This has happened since I was 6 years old. I really don't know how to explain this. And it's not just weeks between the dream and the event, sometimes it'll be months before it happens. And the events that take place in the \"dream\" have never been things that happened before.\n\nSometimes they'll be really specific things. Like I'll \"dream\" of my friend saying a sentence or two about something that happened in the day or hour. Like, \"I can't believe (teacher name) just just yelled at (student name), he's never done that before!\" And when I wake up and recall the dream I'll be confused because I don't understand the context of what my friend said. But then the actual event happens and I'll get it.\n\nThis really worries me and I've been too afraid to tell anyone else. I'm not sure this qualifies as a glitch but I figured I'd share anyways.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I was told to post my story here because it's quite weird and is glitchy as hell.\n\nMy story from late 2011. At the time, I was working as an IT consultant for a small company in Omaha. I had to go to Kansas in order to fix an on-site issue for our customer with the enterprise software that we sold them. Fixing the issue took much longer than expected, so it was pretty much a whole day affair.\n\nMy boss was an asshole but he was not a complete douchebag so I was offered the opportunity to book a hotel and spend the night in Kansas. Problem is – I had made an arrangement with my girlfriend at the time for some quality R&amp;R that evening.\n\nBeing young and full of vigor I stopped at a kiosk, stocked up on chewing gum and energy drinks, and was on my way back to Omaha at about 7PM – about a 3-hour drive. I got on the 29 and everything was peachy. The long drive was uneventful for most of the way. For a while, I had been driving without encountering any other cars on the road until I passed a black truck.\n\nI still remember this part quite vividly. After I had passed the truck I of course expected for his headlights to be way behind me as I was going much faster than it was, but to my surprise no matter how fast I was driving I simply could not distance myself from the truck.\n\nThis continued for a good stretch of the 29 until the truck engaged its high beams and I was partially blinded by the light. I tried to speed up even more to the point where I was doing 80+ but it was no use, the truck just kept following me.\n\nSuddenly complete silence filled the cabin and the radio and headlights died. Red warning lights came on in the car. They were all on – even the one for the open door and parking break. The only source of light for miles were the beaming headlights from the truck behind me. \n\nThis was when I noticed that my car was slowing down. The silence also meant that the engine had cut off and no matter how much I pumped the gas pedal nothing happened. I then tried turning the ignition key but to no avail – the engine did not even produce the whirring sound. I remember going into a panic, fearing that if the car slows down even more, then I would be rammed from behind by the crazy black truck.\n\nSuddenly the car became very hard to steer, the steering wheel kept turning to the right for some reason – almost as if I was being forced off the road. It took the strength of both my hands on the steering wheel just to counteract the force. I swerved to the side of the road, partially because I could not steer the car, partially to avoid having the truck hit me. I tried using the breaks to make the car stop but it was as if the car did not want to break, instead it acted as if it was in control of its own speed. I kept an eye on the rear view mirror and the truck’s headlights were still dead on, now following me on the side of the road. \n\nVivid images of Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction gimp scene flashed before my eyes. I thought to myself “This is it… I am going to be abducted by some crazy trucker and wake up with a gag ball in my mouth in some basement”. After what felt like forever, the car came to a halt. The truck did the same. I scrambled for my phone to call for help.\n\nMy company phone back then was a Samsung Galaxy S2. I pressed the unlock button but the screen just would not turn on – rather the screen turned on but it was completely black. I pressed the button furiously to no avail. After a couple of tries, I quickly popped out the battery to perform a hard reset. The battery was very hot to the touch. It slid out of my sweaty palms and dropped on the car floor.\n\nI hastily patted down the floor for the battery as I was searching for it. I could hear footsteps outside my car. Heavy, dragging footsteps. I was too scared to look up, so I looked down at the car floor for the phone battery. I had goosebumps all over and could feel somebody was watching me from behind. Before long, I could hear taps on my car. First, three fast taps and then, three slow taps. That kept repeating. I loathed having to look up and most of all wanted to assume the fetal position and disappear.\n\nThat is when everything suddenly went completely dark. I found the battery and hesitantly looked around and up at the rearview mirror. The bright headlights were gone and there was nobody there – it was just the completely empty highway and me. I felt my way through the darkness and popped the battery into my phone, to finally boot it up.\n\nTo my dismay, the display said 2AM. I was sure that the phone was just displaying the wrong time. I took out the key and quickly tried turning over the engine again. After what seemed an eternity the car came back to life and I was shocked to see that the clock display on the radio also showed 2AM. I had apparently lost 7 hours of my life on that highway…\n\nThat is when the texts started pouring in. I had received 17 texts - all from my girlfriend. They read, “Looking forward to tonight”, “When are you gonna be here?”, “Why aren’t you answering me?”, “Hello?”, “Are you mad at me for some reason?” and things to that effect.\n\nI contemplated calling the cops – but what would I tell them… That a mysterious black truck tried to run me off the road? I did not even have a license plate number or any other identifying markers other than that it was black.\n\nWeirdly enough I did not feel fatigued after the incident. In fact, I felt quite fresh and continued driving through the night until I got home at about 4AM. Needless to say, when I got home I had trouble sleeping.\n\nTLDR; On a late-night drive a creepy black truck ran me off the road. My car and my phone glitched out. When the episode was over 7 hours had passed and I felt completely refreshed.",

        "text": "First off I'd like to start by saying I am of no religious affiliation and my views are strictly based off of the facts in this world. That being said, I have no idea what happened to me when I was sixteen, and only researched it a little after it had happened, but came up with very little scientific information. It had always been a weird phenomenon in the back of my mind throughout the years, and I figured if anyone else has had this type of experience this may be the place to talk about it. Now twenty-three and reflecting back, it was a very exciting and unnerving experience at the same time. I love dreaming, falling without dying, breathing underwater, jumping large distances, ect. But I could never control it, and thought it would be cool to be awake in your dreams (who wouldn't?), I had brought it up to my sister and she had told me about lucid dreaming, which really caught my interest. For the most part she had told me to just try and stay conscious as you let your body fall asleep, and look for signs in your dreams (turning on lights, looking at your hands or try finding a mirror) it was odd, but I figured why not try. Later on I had attempted it, and this is where things got really weird. For the most part I was laying silently in my room, on my side, in view of my digital clock on the night stand. I just kept trying to keep my mind clear of any thoughts, and focus on nothing but the black of my closed eyes. It wasn't easy but soon I found myself in an extremely peaceful state, reminding myself I am conscious and that I must focus on the black. It had maybe been about 10-15 minutes of this, but eventually i started to feel my heart rate increase, my body was overwhelmed with a tingling sensation throughout my body, and a high pitched tone (like what you hear after a loud concert) was growing audibly louder. soon I felt my eyes open, but not, at the same time, it's hard to describe, I knew they were closed yet there I was staring at the face of my digital clock. Things started getting really intense as I started to have this \"lifting\" feeling in my head, like it was floating away from my body, all the while this overwhelming feeling kept growing, it wasn't pain, it was euphoric. Now at this point I am beyond scared, so I quickly shake it off and get up out of bed, pacing my room i could still feel this \"leaving\" feeling, so I went down stairs and tried to watch some t.v. After about five minutes or so the feeling subsided and my body began to relax again, but I had no idea what had happened and I was terrified. I talked to my sister again about it and she had informed me about something called \"astral projection\", so i looked it up, but in all honesty I could find nothing on it other than people who claim to have left their bodies and gone to other galaxies. Again, it was hard to believe due to the fact there was no scientific explanation for this occurrence. Yet now that i look back and relfect, i wonder if this wasn't an exploration outside of the mind, but inside. could my brain fabricate a vividly accurate representation of my room based off the hundreds of times i've been in and out of there? I just don't know, so seven years later I find my curiosity leading me here. Has anyone else had an experience like this? what is the science behind it? it's an extremely interesting topic and i have contemplated attempting it again, but like a cave-man with a grenade, I don't wish to accidentally pull the pin and screw my mental stability up (it's barely there to begin with!), anyways, that's my weird experience.

I was spreading the peanut butter around when I blinked and suddenly I was.... different.  I was in a different place, some kind of big house and all of my family was there except my sister along with several other faces I didn't recognize.  I was in some kind of kitchen when I looked around and asked \"Where am I?\" to which a short plump woman looked at me and said \"Just admit you were lying\".  Then my dad spoke up and said something.  but... it wasn't quite my dad.  He had the same mannerism and speech patterns, but his face was slightly different.  He looked more like my step-grandfather than my biological grandfather. I didn't catch what he was saying because I just kept staring at his face trying to determine what was different.  Then I blinked again and I was in some kind of basement with the same older plump woman from before (who I didn't know).  I remembered I was making my PB&amp;J to get ready for work, and then I got a sinking feeling in my stomach in this alternate reality and asked the plump woman \"I need to call to see if I'm late for work.\" Then it hit me that this universe was different, so I shouted at the woman saying \"Do I still do quality control work?!  Do I still work at _____(&lt;-where I work)\" and she scoffed at me and said something about \"quit talking like that\" Then it fully hit me that I wasn't in my reality, like... I was somewhere ~other~ and I just started crying.  Im a 24 year old male and I just started ugly sobbing in this strange basement.  Then some kind of noise happened like a low whistle, and I was back in my kitchen but this time I was spreading the jelly on the other slice of the bread and I was breathing REALLY heavy.  I would compare it to walking up 3 flights of steps quickly, that kind of heavy breathing.  \nNeedless to say I got super freaked out and called my friend Jess to make sure everything was back to normal and she was still meeting me to drive to work.  Then I texted my best friend and made sure he still knew me so I know I'm back in my proper reality.  So far nothing I've experienced the rest of today has been out of the ordinary and I just know I don't want to feel that intense dread of realizing my universe is wrong ever EVER again.  \nI keep telling myself that it must have been a micro-dream, or a really intense day dream... but it was just too real.  I hope it doesn't keep happening.",

To make sure I saw what I thought I was seeing, I held the pens up next to each other. Same exact color of light blue. I stuck them both into the side pocket of my purse. When I got to work, I wanted to retrieve both pens only to have one, light blue pen.",

        "text": "First off I want to say that these are actual medical issues, mainly neurological. I'm sharing them here mostly because of timing and how they start so suddenly, and they're currently undiagnosed despite doctors' attention. \n\nFirst and most glitch-like, one day my dad noticed everything looked smudgy and blurry. He thought his glasses just needed to be cleaned, but as soon as he took them off everything was crystal clear. After needing glasses for decades, his vision was suddenly perfect. This lasted for three days, then he went back to his previous prescription. \n\nSecond, from middle school through university a few times a year I would have these odd episodes. I'd get an intense, compounding feeling of deja vu, and for a few minutes I'd completely forget English (the only language I'm fluent in). Any speech sounds like gibberish, except it all rhymes. Usually ends in extreme fatigue, nausea, sometimes even wetting my pants. One neurologist said they're probably seizures, another neurologist says they're definitely not seizures. Who knows. Luckily I haven't had one in a few years.\n\nThird, my mom has had chronic pain and nervous system issues for about six years now. The only thing really that seems glitchy about this is that it wasn't gradual like most chronic disorders; she can tell you the exact date and time this started. Again, no diagnosis despite seeing tons of doctors over the years. \n\nEh I hope this is related enough. Medicine and biology are weird as it is, but when doctors are arguing over it and/or it started in a matter of minutes instead of years, it seems even weirder than your typical weird. If you've also had this feeling of \"hey I know this isn't supposed to be right per se but this seems especially not right,\" please share. ",

So i get the mower out and its not starting, so i just push it over in the grass and take the walkway to the front door when i catch something out of the corner of my eye. The only way i can describe it is, imagine theres a pole made of glass sticking diagonally out of the ground, the place where i see it is distorted and i can physically move around it, its not something i can only see at a certain angle. I tell my family, they think im insane, c'est la vie.\nSome days go by and im walking from my kitchen to my bedroom, passing the dining table and its there again, only sticking out of a wooden table this time. I do the same walk by, and sure as fuck its there.. I dont bother to mention it this time. \nSome time after this im mowing my back yard, our neighbors tree reaches over to our fence but its tall, you'd need a ladder to trim it. I make a pass around the yard and on my way back i duck because i thought i was going to run into something, only nothing was there except the weird interdimensional pole thing, in mid air. Still no idea what it is. Any insight?",

        "text": "Hi everybody. So this just happened and I'm not even sure how to describe it. You're going to need a little back story on this as well, so bear with me. I'm a little freaked out. I'm probably going to delete this after I get (if any) responses or suggestions because a couple people know my reddit username. \n\nLast November I was involved in a car accident. I was riding passenger in my mother's car while a friend was driving. Someone cut us off and we collided, air bags deployed. I broke my collarbone from the seat belt/ air bag. The car was totaled. It was a black Nissan Altima. Time passes, I heal, my mom gets a new car - a silver Nissan Maxima- and life goes on.\n\nToday, I just got home from driving my brother to work. I'm home alone with my pets. I hear our back door open (not close) and the jingle of my mom's keys and recognize her gait and heels as she walks downstairs. I think \"huh that's weird\" for her to be home so early. My dog, who absolutely adores my mother, also recognizes this and bolts down the stairs to greet her as he always does. I go into another room and glance outside.\n\nIn my driveway is the black Altima. completely fine. It takes me a second to register what it is. At first I think my mom's friend, who has a black Infiniti, is in the driveway. Maybe I just saw it out of the corner of my eye. All the while I hear motion downstairs, like if my mom was putting her purse down. I look harder and it's definitely her car. She had a personal items I know only she would have (a dream catcher made by her father hanging from the rear-view mirror, a little stuffed cow beanie baby that she has kept in her car ever since I can remember). \n\nI freak out, and go downstairs. My dog is laying on the ground, kind of whining. Not in a scared way, but he usually starts \"talking\" and whining when he misses my mom. He was doing that, laying down facing where she puts her things when she first arrives. I look in the drive way, no car. No tire tracks either. I live in New England, and it recently snowed. The only imprints in the snow are dulled from her leaving this morning, no other set. I remember seeing a set behind the \"Altima\"\n\nWhat could this be? Did I lucid dream or something from being on autopilot while cleaning or something? I'm trying to call my mom and she's not answering so I'm getting panicky. It's probably nothing, right?\n ",

After reading a bunch of the stories I remembered something that happened to me at least ten years ago.\n\nI came home to our family house at that time, only to find that it had rained. By \"rained\", I mean it had soaked everything, including the street and sidewalk. But then I noticed that the rain had only happened in a big square around our house. This was a typical American suburban neighborhood, where the houses were ~15 ft from each other, so it was very unusual that the rain hadn't touched any of our neighbors' properties. Before you ask, we didn't have a sprinkler system at all, so it couldn't have been some sort of malfunction.\n\nI don't really know if that counts as a glitch, but it's always struck me as weird. I was just on the phone with my mom and decided to ask if she remembered it, thinking maybe I made it up. She immediately said she did, and what's more, my younger sibling (who still lives with her) had randomly brought it up a few days ago (it's not something we've ever really brought up, and like I said it happened a decade ago).",

After the game it was about 11:30 and we headed out of Cleveland to Wooster to drop his girlfriend off. It was an uneventful drive to this point and we dropped her off just before 1 am. She was worried about us driving home without phones, because ours had both died after a long day of travel and taking pics at the game. This is where things got weird. Around 1:30 my buddy and I were shooting the shit and I had to swerve to avoid an animal that darted onto the road. For some reason we found it funny and laughed for a bit. We stopped laughing really soon when we realized that my headlights were now the only lights within eyesight. What had been a highway was now cornfeilds. The change was instant, not like we turned off of the highway. We didn't turn the car around because I knew I hadn't taken an exit. The road we were on was a straight run back to Columbus. It wasn't until almost 3:30 in the morning that we realized where we were. We were right back in Wooster. We were confused, scared, and tired so we ended up staying at a hotel there until morning and then driving back. I've replayed the moments over and over in my head and I know for a fact that I didn't misread the time on the clock, take a wrong turn, or anything else. One second everything was fine and the next we had no clue where we were. I'm still shaken from the whole experience.",

I adjusted where I was sitting, I got closer and farther away, but he now had long hair, and was his 13 year old girlfriend.

We sat and listened to an entire side of the record, and he went completely still when he stood up to change it.\n\n\"What the fuck, am I losing my mind? Where did the incense go?\" I looked at the holder and the only sign of it was the stick that goes in the holder. It didn't feel hot at all, and the room wasn't smoky and didn't smell like the incense. That particular incense is STRONG too, so if it had burned all the way down we definitely would have smelled it. \n\nThe thing is, I saw him put the incense in the holder. He swears he lit it, though I didn't see that happen myself. We both were awake and had our coffee by this point, so it wasn't like either of us was in a sleep-daze. We had listened to the first side of Kraftwerk's Autobahn, which is one song (22 minutes). That incense usually takes longer than that to burn. I have no idea what happened to it. I feel like we switched timelines or something, and ended up in one where we had decided not to burn incense. \n\nTL;DR: boyfriend lights incense for morning record listening, incense completely disappears without a trace.

This one morning my phone alarm goes off at 7am, as usual.  Now I am not a morning person, and every time I turn off my alarm I check to make sure it's REALLY 7am, as there is always a glimmer of hope in my mind that I might be able to continue sleeping.  Alas, it was 7, and I get out of bed and go into the bathroom to shower.\n\nI walk back into my room ~10 minutes later to my alarm going off.  This isn't too strange of an event, sometimes i accidentally press the snooze button (as it's a touchscreen it can be easy to hit the wrong part of the screen) and 5 minutes later the phone will ring until I show up to turn it off.  So, I think nothing of it and turn the alarm off.\n\nThe the alarm screen fades, and the current time is displayed on the screen.  7:00 am, on the dot.  What the hell?  I figure the phone must be wrong, and I turn on my computer but it is consistent with the phone.  Around this point I felt a little lightheaded, and really disoriented.  Could the phone have gone off early?  Why would I have an alarm set for 6:50am?\n\nEventually, I shook it off, sat down and ate breakfast.  Still really unsure of what the hell just happened.  The logical side of me assumes that I misread the time, it must have really been 6:45 or 6:50.  But the thing is I only set alarms to times other than 7am on special occasions, and I certainly didn't consciously set one that morning.  On top of that, I looked back at my saved alarms and they were the same as always, i.e. 7am, 8am, 8:30 etc.\n\nA pretty minor happening, but still made me question reality more than I was comfortable with.\n\ntldr: Woke up to alarm at 7am, took shower, came back to same alarm going off, clocks still read 7am.",

It matched perfectly with the others and wasn't the type of yellow that white plastic can discolour to, it was yellow plastic.\n\nI still can't work it out. ",

        "text": "So this one isn't like, too crazy, but I just for the life of me cannot figure out what happened.\n\nSo I work for a tech company, hardware, software, whatever. We had a project for a client that's been going on for awhile.\n\nI remember awhile back, there was a bug in the system. Okay, then it went away. I didn't do anything, I assumed someone else fixed it. About 6 months later, which was yesterday, there's a bug in the system again. I'm told to fix it and I'm having trouble, so my manager sits down with me to try to troubleshoot it together.\n\nHe says he remembers seeing this bug before, and retraces the steps he took last time to figure it out. After awhile, he says he remembers exactly what's going on, and that this was fixed already. So he hops to the part in the code where the fix was supposed to be. He digs around, and the fix is nowhere to be found in the code.\n\nI'm looking at this, and I say, \"So, you must've fixed this last time on your own, because I don't remember it at all.  If I were to have fixed it, I would've placed the code in the graphics, over here.\" and I point.  And he says \"Yeah, that's exactly what you wanted to do last time. We had this argument. You wanted it in the graphics, I wanted it in the background.\"\n\nI'm wigged out because first, I know the system was working, and it couldn't have if this bug was in it. Second, he couldn't have predicted where I, personally, would've wanted to put the fix.\n\nSo we've got a bug that apparently, I had fixed before, even though I've got no memory of it, and now the fix is gone and the system is back to buggy. Weird.\n\nNext, he insists on figuring out how to place the fix in the background. So I examine it a bit and conclude that the fix would need to be split into three parts and put into three different places, based on the flow of the code. And he sighs and says \"That's right, I lost this argument last time, we decided it would be harder to put it in the background, and we placed it in the graphics, like you wanted.\" What. How.\n\nHe didn't think too much of it afterward, we put the fix in and tested the system and the bug went away, but damn if that isn't really fucking weird.",

Anyway, after unwrapping and looking at all of my presents I decided to open up the box. It was really small, like 1 foot by 1 foot by 2 inches tall. But when I opened one end, there was literally *nothing* in it. I stuck my hand in it, thinking maybe they were all compressed against one end, but my fingernails just scraped cardboard in all of the corners. I turned it over and shook it, nothing came out. I even held it up to the light to look inside, all I could see was cardboard. \nI started complaining to my mom, thinking I'd been ripped off, and she asked me what I'm talking about. She takes the box, turns it over, and to my surprise a couple loops fall out. She shakes it, and the rest of them just *pour* out. I'm really amazed at this point. I think I actually said, \"Wow! How did you do that?\" and she just looked at me like I was stupid.\nI tried asking her about it a little while ago and she said she doesn't remember. There's no way I would have missed a huge clump of bright rainbow loops. I swear that box was empty.",

I heard him call my name, but being lazy I stayed on the couch to wait for him to come up to me physically. Out of the corner of my eye i see him walk from the backhouse to the kitchen door, which is past the glass door's view. A couple seconds later I see the same thing happen, and my heart skipped a beat. This time though, he actually walked through the kitchen to me and made me do some mundane task. I've been wondering what the fuck happened since. ",

        "text": "This is a throwaway account. I need the anonymity - what I am about to say can damage my reputation, my business... everything that I have worked for. Privacy is of the utmost importance.\nWhat I will say is that I am a young American citizen. I live alone and have, until recently, lived happily and prosperously. I am educated. I make my living through a popular blog and youtube commentary. This story, however, cannot be allowed to make its way to the official narrative.\n\nIt began two years ago. There isn't a good way to preface it, because there was no precedence for what happened. I was asleep one night and woke up suddenly. There was no noise, nothing that could have disturbed me. But I felt at that moment a very real and terrible sense of dread. Perhapse that is not the right word - \"dread\". It wasn't only that. It was sadness and fear and the most profound feeling of loss. It was ice in my chest. It was emptiness that I could reach out and touch. There was no more sleeping. I got up and paced around the apartment; I called my mother. I checked the deadbolt on the door. I went on Facebook, expecting to find that someone I knew had died. Nothing. I checked the circles - Google+, Twitter, my website, my channel. Nothing. I watched the news all day and there were no care accidents, no murders, no deaths. The world was as it should be and I couldn't help but grieve. Weeks passed. I spoke to a psychiatrist. I spoke to two. I was prescribed as many medications as I have fingers to count them with and nothing helped. Different combinations were tried. I still felt hollow, only now I wasn't able to drive myself anywhere or even pour a drink. I updated the website and the channel sporadically. I quickly fell from the graces of my network. Nothing was being retweeted or endorsed, and even friends stoppered their obliged support. And the funny thing was, it didn't seem to matter to me. I was grappling with the loss of something I couldn't put my finger on, and it was killing me. That's when the phone calls started. The first one was as much of a shock to me as the next. I was a recluse. The ringing phone was foreboding, unwelcome. If it wasn't a concerned relative it would be a bill collector, and I hadn't the patience or funds to deal with either. I answered the phone and heard weeping.\n\nIt was a woman's voice, that much was clear. She was speaking Spanish; she was pleading with whoever she was talking to. It didn't even occur to me at the time that she was talking to me. Her voice got harsher, more strained; she sounded like she was hurried and didn't have time to say what she needed to. As if someone was trying to tear her away from the phone. The call was dropped suddenly. There were others; they came trickling in little bursts of calls, one after another and then nothing. They were different voices in different languages. Some of them English; the ones that were, were spouting out mournful goodbyes and apologies. I tried to console them at first, but they wouldn't listen. They never would. So I stopped trying. If I rang the call back, no one would answer. If I hung up on the callers before they dropped the call on me, I would get the same caller again, instantly. I quickly learned that the best thing to do was to listen and power through it. I changed my phone number, I even bought a new device... it didn't matter. Nothing stopped the calls. On a good day, I get maybe 3 calls. On a bad day, I have gotten as many as 32. They never last long, only a few minutes each. None of them are happy. None of them make sense. I've spoken to the phone company, I managed to have a few of the numbers traced. They went back to phone booths. That's right, phone booths. None of them ever in the same city. Some of them in the US, some in Canada. The others were unable to be traced; I can only assume that they are phone booths in some other random part of the world. Just this morning I heard from a very young boy speaking German; this one was probably a phone booth in Berlin, if I had to make a guess.\n\nI'd like to say that getting these calls are a nuisance. That they drive me insane, that the very sound of a ringing cell phone is enough to cause a panic attack. But that wouldn't be the truth. The truth is, it's calming. Hearing from my new friends is the only thing that seems to stave off the depression, the crippling loss that I have felt. I haven't needed medication in months now. I'm sleeping at night - when I am not interrupted. I have even been updating my site again, and am working on a new video for next week.\n\nI don't know why this all happened. I do not expect to know who these people are that call me incessantly, and I prefer not to delve to deep into that, really. I like to think that they help me and I help them. Whoever they are.\nOnce my account allows it, I am going to be x-posting this to several subreddits; I do this for perspective, not attention. As someone who has built their life around networking, I really believe that the internet is a wonderful place because so many people are able to connect to one another. And I want to connect with as many people about this as possible because I have to know if I am alone here.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdited for format.",

A small group of weirdos smoking pot and I left pretty quickly, but not before politely taking this gummy form of THC. Little did I know, I was only supposed to have 1/3 of it because it was actually someone's prescription. Whoops. While I was making my way home I became VERY VERY high. My bf was with me and he was okay so I got home safe. This is the only significant high I've ever felt... I didn't even connect it with the candy at first, because every other pot experience has been just itchy eyes and munchies... I guess I have a high tolerance and I only smoke anyway if other people are so I don't end up babysitting a bunch of morons. Just putting that out there so you know I'm not in the habit of taking spaceship rides lol.\n\nAnyway, while we were trying to get home I was absolutely terrified. Holy Terror. I've never felt anything like this. I was only seeing bright white light, and sometimes nothing at all. Like neither darkness nor light; not the physical world or anything in my imagination. But from time to time I’d start thinking about death and infinity and something would unfold my mind and I’d see to the very core of it, how everything was everything else. I saw my face on hundreds of people throughout history, even seeing my face on famous couples (I remember Antony and Cleopatra specifically, but also dozens of nameless people). I was my own enemy, my own lover. And I heard someone say “You are everyone who ever was, is, or will be.” And it was calming in a profound way, but then I’d think it was a lie and become terrified again; I bounced back and forth like this for a while. I also heard this weird nonsense? sentence: “You are all what never were and what may be.”\n\nI was freaking out on the bus ride home, seeing the bus going in both directions at once and feeling so lost. And the bus was so bright, like being in a dentist’s chair. The last thing I heard at the end, I was aware of 2 beings but only one spoke, and I had the distinct feeling they didn’t know I could hear them. It said, in this clinical, male voice, “Her wires are wet, but we can’t cut into her without shattering the illusion of reality.” At the time I was flipping out, because I took them to be angels, thinking of curing my depression, morbidity, whatever is wrong with me, but they knew they shouldn’t because I would have gone mad?\n\nAnd the reason my guess was/is angels, is because this last experience echoes my favorite lines from Rilke’s Duino Elegies: “Every Angel is terrifying… Angels (they say) don’t know whether it is the living they are moving among, or the dead. The eternal torrent whirls all ages along in it, through both realms forever, and their voices are drowned out in its thunderous roar… But if the archangel now, perilous, from behind the stars took even one step down toward us: our own heart, beating higher and higher, would beat us to death.”\n\nMy boyfriend still teases me about it because I scared the shit out of him; according to him I didn't say a word for the next 6 hours and just shook and stared. (I thought this bit was odd because I can't stfu when stoned and I get self-conscious about it.) I think about what I heard and saw often, and I'm always looking for similar stories...",
