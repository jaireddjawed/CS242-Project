I just finished writing a newsletter for my church (The First Church of Cannabis) about this very topic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the Cannaterian Bible we have a \"suggested pathway\" about positivity here: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Laugh often, share humor. Have fun in life, be positive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin, the Bible itself, it goes on to refer to Life as a \"Great Journey\" and that point of life is to have fun and enjoy it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrankly, any time I'm at my job (which is more often than not) my life sucks. This idea that life should be or has to be enjoyed just seems to come from a privileged position. I think people should be free to not enjoy their lives and to be angry about their lot in life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it seems like many religions and maybe my own, Cannaterianism, often stifles feelings of Agitation. While I think positivity has its place as well as love, perhaps Anger and Pessimism to have their place as well in our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "I think there are a fair number of people on this sub who will like this, since it's historical leftist and antifascist music. \n\nThey were originally written during WW2 by jewish soldiers in the Red Army and soviet jewish civilians covering a variety of topics and moods. Some are marching songs, others mourn what has transpired, and others are wrathful and revengeful in tone, comparing Hitler to [Haman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman) from the story of [Purim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim) The lyrics sheets were discovered in the 1990s from an archive in Kiev and a group of professional historians and musicians have recorded recreations of them. Many of them had their original sheet music in the archive, but not all of them. The whole thing is just incredible. It's some of the last cultural contributions from when yiddish was a significant living language in these regions, before the holocaust/war destroyed these communities. [This podcast episode](https://soundcloud.com/yiddishbookcenter/the-shmooze-ep0177) goes over how the songs were discovered, what what went into producing the recordings for them, what their significance is, and what their subject matter and themes are including the hundreds of discovered songs from the archive that haven't been recorded yet. \n\n[Here's the whole album](https://soundcloud.com/yiddishglory/sets/the-lost-songs-of-world-war-ii)\n\n[You can buy any songs you like here](https://yiddishglory.bandcamp.com/)\n\nMy favorite is [Misha tserayst Hitlers Daytchland](https://soundcloud.com/yiddishglory/misha-tserayst-hitlers?in=yiddishglory/sets/the-lost-songs-of-world-war-ii), which borrows the tune of [Katyusha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J__ZdvsZaE) and modifies it to give it a soulful yiddish feel and vibe.
