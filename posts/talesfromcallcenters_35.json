        "text": "Hey, /r/talesfromcallcenters,\n\nI work in a third party collections center for a telecom, and I've been threatened by customers a number of times. I've never been worried because I have my trusty alias and fake employee ID to keep me safe. Today there was a policy change! Now we give customers our real first names during the opening script.\n\nAs someone who has a very uncommon first name, I'm not comfortable with this. It doesn't help that most of the rare people with my name are female and my voice is clearly male. It also doesn't help that I'm required to name the state in which the call center is located, which is one of the smallest states in the USA. Last week I had a woman explain to me how she was going to ruin my life for half an hour. I don't want those people to have my name.\nI spoke to my pod leader and supervisor about the issue.\n\nApparently the telecom now wants the name we give customers to match the name on the account we use to access the system, which means real first names. My supervisor contacted the telecom to see if I could get an exception. I can't. I asked if I could have another account with a different name. I can't.\n\nIs this even remotely common practice? Would you be concerned if you had an unusual first name?",

Now, they are trying to move it all online instead, but when you go onto the app, it makes you take a photo and logs your location (to make sure you are in the building, not just down the pub or getting someone else to log in for you). Then the computer does stuff to check and give you money for working.\n\nI just think that is is quite personal, invasive and unnecessary. It is like the HR and call centre managers had a meeting where HR said \"we are bored of verifying everyone's clock in times,\" the call centre managers said \"we are bored of seeing our staff turn up still looking almost human despite the long hours, abuse and minimum pay, we need to remedy that,\" and then thought of a solution.\n\nOh, and they do not have a staff wi-fi for us to use to do so. And since leaving, I have found out that co-workers can't even vent on Facebook anymore because the managers have made an effort to friend EVERYONE (even those not on their team), and get casually questioned if they don't accept the requests.\n\nSad, sad times",

Now, the key in this is the word \"Emergency\". We only tow vehicles that are broken down or in a \"non-running\" condition. We don't tow becasuse of expired tabs or insurance. Today I got a call from a guy we shall call \"Pants on Fire\"\n\nMe: \"Thank you for calling emergency road service company how can I help you today?\"\n\nPoF: \"I need you to tow my volvo because the insurance is expired.\"\n\nMe: \"Is it in a running condition?

The call went through without a hitch and all was well until the end (except for my own resentful feelings). I was still making notes in the call and didn't release the call right away, and the member didn't either, and I heard him talking to his buddy. Here's what they said when they thought I had hung up:\n\nBuddy: \"You're really good at that.\"\n\nPoF: \"Yeah but you gotta trick 'em.\"\n\nBuddy: \"Guess you really learn something after all those years being head honcho in a call center.\"\n\nPoF: \"Yeah, you learn to talk where you make everybody think it's their idea.\"\n\nBoth of them proceeded to laugh at how they had tricked me and gotten away with it, and discuss what story to tell the driver when he got on scene because I had told them he was going to check to make sure it was broken down. I decided I'd listened to them enough, called up my sup, and asked what to do, quoting them verbatim. Basically all they told me to do was leave a note to make sure the driver checked on whether the veh worked or not. I looked later, they towed him. ",

I only use this late at night when it slows down, but I'm a little paranoid. Are there metrics to track the number of times an employee goes into aux, or other ways of catching onto this?

Sorry about the format in advance.\n\nI'm a T1 tech support for a tech company that has a fruit for its logo, and I support phones, tablets, desktops and laptops. \n\nSo today there's this lady with a smoky voice calling in with a barrage of idiotic questions. It started with her not knowing how to set up her brand new external hard drive with her desktop, and that she doesn't know it's called an external hard drive or what it's for, and that she thought she ordered a new RAM.\n\nAfter we sorted that out, she had more questions for me, namely, how to delete her pictures.\n\nNow before we get to the juicy part, let me preface this by saying every time we screen share with a customer, we always have to read the disclaimer: this session is recorded, please remove any confidential or private content from your screen before we continue.\n\nAnd here's where it gets good...\n\n&gt;Lady: I have these pictures here that are so inappropriate I want to know how to delete them. *scrolls past lots of pictures of a girl surely under US legal drinking age flipping the bird* I don't care if you see them. I just wanna get rid of them. *scrolls*\n\n&gt;Me: Sure, I can definitely help you with that.\n\n&gt;Lady: That's my daughter by the way. She keeps putting these pictures in my computer. It's so inappropriate.\n\nThen...**BAM!!!**\n\nA picture of, whom I assume is said daughter, in all her naked, reversed cowgirl, spread-eagled glory popped onto the screen.\n\n&gt;Lady: How do I delete this one?\n\n&gt;Me: *blocking the screen share window with my browser* Uh, just drag it to the trash please.\n\n&gt;Lady: It's not doing it.\n\n&gt;Me: Could you try again please.\n\n&gt;Lady: Now it went. But do I need to delete them one by one, or can I delete several of them?\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah you can select several at the same time. Just drag your cursor across them to select all the pictures you want to delete.\n\n&gt;Lady: Okay that should do it.\n\n&gt;Me: *goes back to the screen share window*\n\n&gt;Lady: Oh actually I have some more pictures to delete too. *scrolls*\n\n&gt;Me: *puts browser back*\n\n&gt;Lady: There's this picture that my son took of my boobs. It's so embarrassing. I'm gonna delete it too.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay!\n\nI was so tempted to ask her if her son has broken his arms...\n\nEventually, this call ended up being hour-and-a-half long. I had to create four separate cases. And I was more than an hour late for my lunch.\n\nAs I was explaining to my team leader what happened, he gave me a horrified, deer-in-the-headlight look.\n\n&gt;Me: Yup, I earned my $x hourly today!",

As do lots of other programs. What are you doing about this?\n\n**Me:** Well, nothing. Sophos is an external company whom we just happen to have as licence with to provide AV software. If there's known issues with it then we will raise it with Sophos at the appropriate level. That said, the latest version of OS X, \"Sierra\", is actually unsupported at the moment by us - this is a business machine and as per the terms when the machine was handed out it should not be updated without prior approval.\n\n**Caller's Husband:** Oh that's fine. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I have a certificate in Microsoft [wtf]\n\n**Me:** R... right. You do realise this is a Mac? Anyway, I'm going to email your wife the details shortly. Is there anything else?\n\n**Caller's Husband:** Yes. I'm going to upgrade the diskette drive in this machine do I need to let you know?\n\n**Me:** Sir, that's completely against the terms of use and would constitute damage to company property. If your wife requires the machine to be upgraded she can raise a request with us to have this fulfilled\n\n**Caller's Husband:** That's going to take too long, see I've got a 60 GB IE drive laying around\n\n**Me:** Sir, you do understand this machine has a 256 GB SSD drive don't you? 60 GB is significantly less - not to mention these Mac's use a propitiatory SSD so I seriously doubt the drive you have \"laying around\" is compatible with the machine. Please ask your wife to raise a request and do not do this yourself.\n\n**Caller's Husband:** Well okay then.\n\n**Me:** Goodbye sir *click*\n\nI fire out a warning email to &lt;callers&gt; manager as an FYI on appropriate personal use of business machines (i.e. the husband should not be using it in the first place) and a recommendation to review &lt;callers&gt; actual need for a personal laptop - before the husband turns a thousand dollar machine into frankenstein.",

        "text": "Hello, so I've been working at a call center for about a year and a half now, and I feel like I need to vent a little bit, or I'll probably try and strangle someone with my headset the next time I go to work.\n\nBefore this rant, I just wanted to thank this subreddit for existing, and everyone here posting their stories. It helps to know I'm not alone.\n\nI can't leave this coal-mine of a job simply because I'm a student and I'm in debt, until things smooth out a bit on the financial side - I'm stuck. \nI don't even know where to begin, I guess I'll just type  out that I hate about this job and see where this takes me.\n\nI work for a large company that takes on outsourced work from better developed countries, so as you can probably expect - the customers are entitled, and it pays in peanuts. I've worked for a variety of clients over that short period of time, and they're all the same, the product you're forced to push is different, but the general principals are sadly the same.\n\nThe turnover here is crazy, people are hired by the dozens, with the expectation that maybe one or two will last till tier two. Training is back to back to back to back. Over the past year and a half, almost all of the people I started working with have quit, they either found something better (god bless their tortured little souls) or just couldn't take the stress. Now, what that leaves the center with is one or two people that actually know what they are doing, and a mob of newbies that have to be supervised constantly as they're not even able to go through a call without putting the customer on hold and running around the floor looking for help. IT. SUCKS.\n\nNow, why are people leaving? Because they're not getting any respect. At all. The clients are incredibly entitled, and constantly demand things that are not possible. I mean logistically, we can not do the things they are asking us to do, and yet. We have a thing where we literally could not provide them with a negative answer, (you know, like saying \"no, we can't do that, you delusional bag of bones\"), we always have to provide the customer multiple options framed positively, even if there are none, and if we can't think of any, our call get scored down.\n\nI feel like I can manage the customers, because after all - they pay us, so they get to be pricks. The management, however is a different story. They have their heads so far up their asses, you'd think the Ouroboros is doing it wrong. I don't even know where to begin. The agents are treated very, very poorly. We are talked down to, get information withheld from us, we don't even have access to basic things that are needed to do our job (like you know, basic google access, software, training, info). Any requests, inquiries, or schedule preferences may as well be submitted to the closest trash bin.\nBasically we're treated like children. They were literally handing out coloured bracelets and stickers to top performers, posting memes in our updates and trying to get us to play \"party\" games during out break time. I'm sure I could think of many other things if I took the time.\n\nI feel like I could go on and on about this stuff, but there's really no point. I'm just waiting this out, but it's getting really hard to bear.\nAnyway, I'd like to thank you guys once more, simply for existing. Who knows, maybe after I'm done with things, I'll be sharing a couple of interesting stories.",

If you don't like the advertisement, you can burn it, do whatever you would like. If you don't want to see these mailings I can remove you from the mailing list. \n\nCustomer: I don't buy into that political correct bullshit.

The best I can do is remove you off the mailing list. \n\nWent on for a few minutes about \"Losing him as a customer\". I honestly don't care that he's a customer or not, he was actually in collections, so he owes us money. \n\nAnyway, I'm not exactly shocked from the racism, I'm more shocked that he would have so little to do in his day, other than complain about an ad he received in the mail. \n\n",

Had a very rude customer on the line who wanted a technician out to her house \"NOW\". \n\nWhen I told her I could get her a priority appointment for the same day between 1-6 this wasn't acceptable to her because the previous tech had cancelled her appointment for 10-12pm whatever reason.\n\nKeep in mind, the company I work for takes calls out of Florida and I'm in Louisville, Kentucky so I guess she wanted me to magically teleport myself halfway across the country and force a technician to come to her house.\n\nWith that said, even though I did my absolute best to help her by getting her a technician on the same day (a day before a hurricane mind you.) she was still angry and started dropping F-bombs like no tomorrow. She demanded a supervisor. I put her on hold to get her to a supervisor. Well apparently even when we have the customer on hold, the faggots over at our QA department can still hear the call through our headsets. \n\nWell, I thought I was in the clear to vent. Said to my self, \"suck my dick you fucking bitch\" while she was on hold so no one could hear me. Apparently QA heard it. Was contacted by my manger later in the day about it, received a one time warning, next time I slip up I'm terminated.\n\nPart of me was glad to still have my job and I am thankful that my manager is a cool guy who didn't recommend termination but the other part of me almost wanted to be terminated so that I wouldn't have to deal with the daily misery of having to listen to these assholes scream at me over shit I have no control over.\n\nWith that said, life is a nasty bitch.",

I'd suggest perhaps asking at the business centre reception desk to see if they're able to manually reset the pin for you or offer an alternative solution\n\n**Caller:** But why should I? You're IT! I *need* this by tomorrow for my business meeting!\n\n**Me:** We're *out of hours* IT. I unfortunately do not have access to the required systems to manually change your PIN and as I mentioned &amp;lt;self service system used to reset printer login PINS&gt; is currently offline for scheduled maintenance - therefore the best option would be to speak to the reception desk\n\n... back and forth for 10 minutes about what out of hours IT can and can't do ...\n\n**Caller:** OK I'm going to the reception desk *right now*\n\n**Me:** Okay thanks for call----\n\n**Caller:** WAIT ON THE LINE!\n\n**Me:** Wha... Okay?\n\n...8 minutes of him huffing and puffing whilst making his way to the reception desk - including me getting to enjoy the music in the lifts...\n\n**Caller:** EXCUSE ME! [rants to the reception]\n\n...10 minutes of him huffing and puffing whilst arguing with the reception desk - we're now 28 minutes in...\n\n**Caller:**... SO YOU SPEAK TO THEM THEN!\n\n**lady on reception desk:** Uh... hello?\n\n**Me:** Hi, I'm very sorry about all of this [explain situation], so given &amp;lt;caller&gt; is being very persistent I wondered if there's anything you could do?\n\n**lady on reception desk:** One of my colleagues has access to the back end system and can change &amp;lt;callers&gt; pin if required, we can take it from here and possibly let him print and pay later if it's as urgent as he makes out. My colleague has just stepped out but will be back soon\n\n**Me:** That's great thank you, want to put him back on the call and I'll explain?\n\n**lady on reception desk:** Sure thing\n\n.. now been on the call for 41 minutes ...\n\n**Caller:** IT'S ABOUT TIME!\n\n**Me:** Thank you for waiting, the lady on reception has advised that her colleague will be returning shortly and has access to the back end system or if that fails maybe able to setup a pay later option\n\n**Caller:** AND WHEN WILL THAT BE! IT'S URGENT I GET THIS PRINTED YOU KNOW!\n\n**Me:** The lady on reception desk advised he will be back soon\n\n**Caller:** BUT THIS IS URGENT. YOU NEED TO WAIT WITH ME UNTIL I GET THIS RESOLVED!\n\n**Me:** Respectfully, we've been on this call now for 48 minutes and I've exhausted all of my available options, there's little point in me waiting on the phone with you as there's nothing further I can do from my end. Please wait at the reception desk who are arranging further help.\n\n**Caller:** BUT I NEED THIS URGENTLY I NEED IT FOR TOMORROW!\n\n**Me:** Yes I do understand that, however it's now nearly 9 pm - there's nothing further that IT can do at this time. In future please print these things in advance to allow enough time to iron out any issues such as this, or, print during business hours when we have people on site to deal with this\n\n**Caller:** THIS IS RIDICULOUS! THERE MUST BE SOMEONE YOU CAN CALL!\n\n**Me:** There's not, the system's down for planned maintenance at the moment. Our only escalation point is to the director of IT and only for escalating core system failure/emergency issues, not something like this\n\n**Caller:** *SIGH* I DONT CARE THIS IS URGENT\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, we have a queue of 6 callers waiting, anyone of these could be a genuine IT emergency. I could very well lose my job for contacting the Director of IT over something such as this. I've spent now 50 minutes dealing with this for you, however it's now out of my hands. The lady on the reception desk has arranged further help for you to get this resolved. Goodbye\n\n**Caller:** DONT YOU FUC---\n\n**Me:** *click*\n\n**P.S.

        "text": "Hi, it's me again. I've got a real messed up story here, probably one of the more f-cked up situations I've been in since I started this job (and I've been here a year now, woo). \n\nSo this guy calls in last week because on September 27th, he ordered a monogrammed tote for his gf's birthday and it hadn't arrived yet. Problem is, our monogramming process can take up to 2 weeks, and he ordered it with Expedited shipping. The delivery method doesn't affect the monogram process itself, rather just how quickly it ships out from our warehouse, which is still included in our 2 week timeframe. It's right on our website - I admit, it's not glaringly obvious but it's there when you're personalizing the tote on our website.\n\nAnyway, guy emails us asking what's taking so long, why hasn't he received shipping confirmation. My associate explains that the expedited shipping method doesn't expedite the actual monogram process, and tells him this. *Well*. He didn't like that answer very much. Dude sends us this biblical scroll of an email, going on and on about how terrible we were, and listing bullet points for every option he wants us to consider to \"rectify the situation and make him and his girlfriend happy, because otherwise we'd singlehandedly ruin her birthday\" and threatened that he'd leave a nasty review on social media. This was late Friday night, and supposedly his gf's birthday was, you guessed it, Saturday. \n\nSo I go all out for this guy. Because of the nature of the email, I didn't want to prolong the email chain. Naturally, none of my department's sups are here this late, so I reach out to the floor sup for assistance and he's super helpful. I even call this guy myself, offer to Saturday deliver a new tote (not monogrammed) at a discounted price so he can have something to give his gf. I explained that I cannot get this monogrammed, and that I'll cancel the monogramming on the first order so that both totes arrive within a reasonable amount of time. I even offered to waive monogramming in the future, and to waive that shipping cost as well. \n\nDude seemed really happy with my answer, and everything's hunky dory. He even tweets at my company's Twitter account saying how awesome I was, that the customer service was great. At the time, he completely understood that I could not monogram either tote in time, but that he could send either one back for monogramming, and just return the other one for a refund. Seems ok, right?\n\nWell, I got a voicemail today from him (I was on lunch), and I couldn't believe it. He's saying how upset he was when he received both totes and that they weren't monogrammed, how he was charged for this, how this has become such an ordeal and his girlfriend was upset, bla bla bla... I was shocked. I flat out told him in our phone convo that we could not get these monogrammed in time for her birthday, and that we would honor it if he sent it back to us. \n\nIt gets worse. He tweets at my company Twitter again, only this time saying how horrible I was and was \"disappointed in my services and failed to deliver\". Even the sup from our Customer Advocate team (they handle social media) came over to my desk and asked me what was going on, because it was that crazy. I've never felt more frustrated/humiliated in my life. \n\nI explained my side of the story, showed her the notes I left and basically told her she could handle him now, because I had done everything I could. I am usually an extremely accountable person, but it really ruined my night. I wonder if his gf knows just how much of an asshole her boyfriend is to customer service people, because if I were her, I'd seriously reconsider the relationship.\n\n**UPDATE** I have an update: This customer is now harassing me. He's sending multiple emails to my company saying how terrible I am and wants my boss to fire me. I'm at a loss. I'm not at work right now, but I'm scared he's going to leave me another voicemail. Customer Advocate never left any notes on his profile, but my coworker received his email and basically said \"[my name] has helped you enough, but I'll file some feedback\". I really don't know what to do.\n\n**tl;dr:** I do everything in my power to accommodate an idiot customer's mistakes/misunderstandings, and I still get shat on. I hate this job.\n\n",

        "text": "I want to stay in this role for a year but I'm so close to having a mental break down. Yesterday I was abused by an extremely nasty woman. I was having trouble finding correct information. She made a complaint. Probably about me. Now I have to go in today and deal with the repercussions. I tossed and turned all night long. It's not even really my fault, but they will blame me for it. My heart is racing and my stomach has been churning all night. I'm tired and feel physically sick. \n\nI can't stand it anymore. The hot-desking, constantly being sick from using a mouthpiece other people have used the day before, timed bathroom breaks, quality assurance being able to pick any of the 1,000 calls I take during a month, the constant abuse and passive-aggressiveness from the customers. Every little thing I do is watched, monitored. They force us to work public holidays. Changed opening hours without even telling us, without even asking us, and now we are just rostered to do those shifts. The shift work- constantly changing shifts it's hard to have a routine. Plus I commute pretty far to get to this place. I just can't do this anymore. \n\nI don't want to be unemployed again, but part of me wishes they WOULD fire me so I have an out. This job is destroying me mentally. I feel like I don't deserve any better after being unemployed for so long this was the only thing I could find full time that didn't need experience. I have no degree. I'm getting on a bit in age. I feel like this is my last option to get some experience to find another job. It's bad when you think maybe working at Macdonalds would be better. But that is honestly where I'm at. \n\nI wish the place offered free therapy. I'm starting to have anxiety attacks. ",

        "text": "Hi TFCC, another story from my days at a big mobile service provider. \n\nI think Im not exaggerating when I say Ive spoken to this particular customer upwards of 40 times during my employment there. \n\nHe was the captain of some small local football team and one day, he decided to open a group account for himself and the team. They all got simcards with a fairly good deal on minutes and calls and also had a few handsets taken out along with it that were all monthly paid with 0 upfront cost. Their usual monthly bill should have been a few hundred but in their first month, the lads built up a bill of over 3 grand. There was everything on there: premium numbers, international calls (a few of them had foreign girlfriends as Ive found out later), also lots of WAP charges and purchases. For those that don't know, WAP was kind of like the precursor of the internet for phones, before smartphones arrived on the scene. Access to it was charged by the minute and people mainly used it to purchase stupid sh** like ringtones and schmexy wallpapers.\n\nThe captain threw a real hissy fit about the bill, calling us crooks and thieves, swearing that his boys would never do this to him. We straight up read out the items to him and he still refused to believe it. After a bit of back and forth, retention worked out a deal with him where if he pays half the bill upfront now, their package can continue and the other half will be added in parts to his next 3 bills. He reluctantly accepted but in the next month, the team have done it again. More international calls, more WAP purchases. The bill was around 1500 this time only, but a part of the previous one was still added to it too. The captain absolutely refused to pay this time and demanded that we waiver all these ridiculous made-up charges. Of course we didn't so the entire account was cancelled and on top of owing us the bills, they now also had to pay off the phones in full since they were no longer eligible for monthly installments. They now owed us a very significant amount of money. In these cases, company policy dictates that collections will harass them with letters for a few months and then just sell the debt to a debt collector to recoup losses. Thats exactly what happened here and that's when things started going downhill bigtime for the poor captain. \n\nDebt collectors have a lot more authority and power than we did. They started visiting him at his house to demand payment, flood him with letters, ordered his employer to send 33% of his wages straight to them every month, locked a bank account of his, etc. How do I know all this? Because this guy firmly believed that it was MY company doing all of this and kept demanding complaints and managers to stop it. Various people explained to him COUNTLESS times that he no longer has anything to do with us, he owes the debt collector and he will need to speak to them. I never quite understood his reasoning behind insisting that it was us. This kept going for a good 6-8 months until, on one of his last calls, he was complaining that we are taking him to court and he received court summons and how unacceptable that is. Once again, someone carefully explained to him that its probably the debt collector and he REALLY shouldn't ignore it. He unleashed his usual stream of insults and the call center manager decided that enough is enough and blocked his number from the phone system. Agents were also told that if he ever calls again from a different number, tell him that we no longer wish to speak to him, he can direct correspondence to us in writing and just hang up. I never found out how bad the debt collector f***ed him but if it went to court, I`m guessing no lube was involved.\n\nSorry for the long post, TLDR: When you owe someone so much money that they sell it to a debt collector, consider paying it off before it goes to court.\n\nEdit: Hate formatting on reddit\n",

It's an Act of Parliament, and Acts and Statutes are not laws! The only true, valid law is common law. Acts and Statutes are only valid if both parties agree to comply.\n\n**Me:** That's... not how it works.\n\n**CT:** Yes it is! You ought to do some fucking homework, lad, then you'll see that Acts and Statutes are not the same as laws. I've got a police handbook here, and it says absolutely nothing about data protection!\n\n**Me:** (*OK, let's not argue with a real-life YouTube comment any more*) Right... anyway, Mr (surname), you want to pay your bill, is that right.\n\n**CT:** Yes.\n\n**Me:** Your current outstanding balance is (amount), do you want to pay all that today?\n\n**CT:** Yes.\n\n**Me:** (*pulling up the payment system*) Will you be paying by your own card?\n\n**CT:** (*in the exact tone of voice he's been using up to now*) No, I'll be using someone else's.\n\n**Me:** Is the cardholder present.\n\n**CT:** I'm using my own card, mate, obviously.

I see...\n\n**CT:** Thanks. Now when you get home, do a bit of homework and you'll see that Acts and Statutes aren't laws.\n\n**Me:** They really are.\n\n**CT:** No they're not! They're acts passed by paedophiles in Parliament which have no legal standing!\n\n**Me:** (*jaw drops*) ...\n\n**CT:** All those paedophiles get together and try to con us into accepting fake rules. Take my advice, do your homework and don't believe those paedophiles. Goodbye.

He was totally reasonable when it came to paying his bills, but had a really weird idea of how laws work. Now, since I work in a call centre, I'm obviously not a lawyer; moreover, I have no formal legal training at all, but even I know that common law builds on top of statute law. Also, I don't believe that one's sexual proclivities prevent laws from being valid, though they would definitely inhibit one's ability to get into a position of being able to pass them.\n\nI laughed out loud, albeit quietly, for a solid minute after I finished dealing with this weirdo.",

        "text": "I worked at a Domain Registrar both on the phones and over chat (no longer work there, glad I don't) and some of the calls/chats from that place were hilarious. Some of the more interesting ones were when domains expire. \n\nIf you don't know what happens when a domain expires, it's pretty simple. You have X amount of time to renew it at no additional charge. After that time (varies by company) there is a redemption fee added (also varies by company, it could be anywhere from $40-$500 depending on where the domain is registered) and you can still recover it for another set amount of time.\n\nThe redemption fees could be interesting because we did have the power to waive or reduce them. I usually judged by how much of an ass the person on the phone was when I told them the price (I can't even tell you how many times a person screwed themselves because they immediately jumped down my throat when all they had to do was ask nicely.) This story is far past a redemption fee though.\n\nThe timeframes on this can vary, with the company I worked at, it was about 45 days, sometimes could be up to 2 months. \n\nI get a chat in May. This person had lost two pretty good domains (not amazing, but they were worth at least a few thousand each). They expired in January and February. One domain was now listed by the current owner at auction. The other domain was owned but they hadn't done anything with it yet. The auction domain we could have bought right away and he would have had it within a few days but he refused to pay for it. Why? He wanted us to pay for it, as well as contact the new owner of the other domain and pay whatever it took to get it. I think he threated to sue us if we didn't.\n\nHe claimed that he was in china and our website didn't work in china (not true, I've gotten plenty of people from china.) I asked why he never called us because we could have processed the renewals over the phone, he claimed our number never worked.\n\nBecause of this, he claimed has not been able to access our website and his account at all.\n\nI go and check out the account history, and I start calling out his bullshit. \n\nMe: I see you accessed the account and processed an order two weeks before the first domain expired. Is there a reason you didn't renew them at that time?\n\nCustomer: They hadn't expired.\n\nMe: Alright, I also see you successfully accessed the account and processed another order two weeks after the first domain expired and one week before the second domain expired. Is there a reason you didn't renew them at that time.\n\nCustomer:I hadn't realized it expired. (Just a note to add, his main account page would have had a notice about expired domains)\n\nMe: And when you accessed the account one week after the second domain expired and placed an order then, is there a reason you didn't renew the domains at that time?\n\nCustomer:...\n\nMe: I also see you contacted us over chat before, at that time both domains were still recoverable.\n\nCustomer: It was too expensive and they wouldn't lower it\n\nMe: That is because at that point both domains had been expired for quite a while and had the redemption fee. It looks like they refused to lower it because you have previously had fees lowered in this account and been warned about the timeframe and process.\n\nCustomer: You need to give those domains back to me!\n\nMe: I'm sorry but we cannot take the domains away from their current owner and we will not be able to purchase them for you. If you would like to buy back the domain it would be $xxxx.xx. If not, was there anything else you needed help with?\n\nAnd he left. As far as I know, he never got those domains back.\n\nTLDR: Just fucking read it, if it's too long for you I don't care.",

This is another call from the out of hours desk of hell which took place a few weeks ago.\n\nIt's 11:30 pm, I'm happily reading Reddit - no callers for over an hour, life is good and then my phone starts ringing...\n\n**Me:** Service Desk...\n\n**Caller:** What do I do! Security are trying to throw me out!\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, where are you?\n\n**Caller:** I'm in &lt;building that officially closes at 11 pm&gt;\n\n**Me:** Okay? Well &lt;building&gt; officially closed half an hour ago, I'm not sure why you're calling IT?\n\n**Caller:** Because I have an IT problem!\n\n**Me:** Okay? Which is?\n\n[*Argument between caller and security guard after she is asked very loudly to get her stuff together and leave*]\n\n**Caller:** HELLO!\n\n**Me:** Yes hello, I think you need to leave\n\n**Caller:** NO I HAVE AN IT PROBLEM AND YOU NEED TO HELP ME!\n\n**Me:** What's the problem please?\n\n**Caller:** I HAVE A DEADLINE DUE AT 11 pm I NEED TO UPLOAD SOMETHING TO &lt;HR SYSTEM&gt; BUT IT HASN'T BEEN WORKING [literally screaming] IT SAYS THAT I'VE MISSED THE DEADLINE! WHAT DO I DO?\n\n**Me:** Ma'am I'm not familiar with &lt;HR SYSTEM&gt;, we have absolutely no information regarding this it's all managed by HR, not IT. That said, you do realise it's now 11:30 pm so technically the message *is* correct?\n\n**Caller:** I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE 10:30 PM BUT I DIDN'T GET LOGGED INTO MY PC UNTIL 11 PM\n\n**Me:** Well Ma'am I'm sorry but you missed the deadline. There's not much I can do, you'll need to speak to HR to see what happens next.\n\n**Caller:** I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN'T HELP ME. THIS APPLICATION HAS BEEN ON &lt;HR SYSTEM&gt; FOR 6 MONTHS AND YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT?\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, as I said, we don't deal with &lt;HR SYSTEM&gt; at all, *especially* on the out of hours desk. I have no knowledge of how this works, that said, I'm pretty sure that if you're telling me the application has been open for 6 months and the deadline was 11 pm tonight and the error you're getting is that you've missed the deadline - paired with the fact it's now HALF PAST 11, then I'd suggest there's no system/IT related fault here.\n\n**Caller:** SO WHAT DO I DO THEN?\n\n**Me:** Speak to HR\n\n**Caller:** THIS IS BULLSHIT. I WANT YOUR FULL NAME AND EMPLOYEE NUMBER YOU'RE GOING TO GET FIRED. SO ARE YOU GUYS [assuming she's talking to security].\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, I don't have to give you that.\n\n[*Argument again between caller and security ~~guard~~ guard(s)? now involving me as \"IT won't help me either\". Loads of abuse being shouted at the security guys. Eventually ends with the phone being slammed down*]\n\n**Security** Hi, sorry we're now escorting &lt;caller&gt; out of the building. We closed at 11, but we've given her half an hour as she said it was an emergency, but her times up, for insurance reasons we can't let her stay here and our shifts technically ended 15 mins ago.\n\n**Me:** Hey no problem man, there's nothing we can do for her anyway, I don't suppose she's still logged into the computer is she?\n\n**Security** Looks like it\n\n**Me:** Can you go ahead and open &lt;computer info program&gt; for me and read her username?\n\n**Security** Sure, it's &lt;username&gt;\n\n**Me:** Excellent! I've gone ahead and disabled her IT access due to leaving a machine unattended which is expressly forbidden, I'll also raise a complaint to her management about her conduct - want me to CC in the security desk so you guys can forward a report?\n\n**Security** That'd be great!\n\n**Me:** No worries, goodbye! *click*\n\n**P.S if you haven't already, subscribe to /r/callcentres for more stories like this and general call centre discussion!**",

        "text": "So I currently work for a major mobile telecom in the US that's had some plans where you can get a free entry level smartphone for signing up. These aren't great phones but a lot of elderly customers love them because they're easy to use and a huge step up from their decade old flip phone that doesn't work with our current spectrum. This story involved my coworker (S for smoker) and the customer (HL for hospital lady, in her 70's).  \n\nS works in retention and HL was calling from the hospital because her old phone had terrible service and she didn't want to pay for it anymore. Apparently she was getting ready for a major surgery and was starting to get concerned about bills and such, completely reasonable reaction. You can tell shes kinda lonely there so they go through a lot of small talk about her hospital and the procedure while S us looking for a good offer for HL. S tells me that the whole length of the call you can hear her breathing tube and the soft beeping of hospital equipent in the background. So S tells her that the plan she's on qualifies her for a free phone and she is absolutely pleased. She's going off about how awesome he is and how excited she is... like, really excited....\n\n\nMaybe too excited.\n\n\n\nS says that all of a sudden he just hears her voice trail off followed by a loud thump. He knows the call didn't drop because he can still here her oxygen supply and the beeping in the background. After 30 seconds of him freaking out and trying to get a response from her he throws down his headset and grabs his supervisor. Sup tries to get a response and nothing. S grabs the headset back and finally tells the sup that something is wrong and he was going to get her help. Sup says \"Fuck it, call 911 now. If you catch anything from this I'll take care of it, just call them right now.\" S 911 and relays the situation, including HL's name and what hospital she said she was calling from. S  gave their personal cell number as the contact to 911 because he had no other number to give. Finally he gets off the call and goes out for a well deserved walk and a smoke.\n\n\nHappy ending to the story, he finally gets contact back. HL ended up OK aside from some bad bruising from the fall. She literally got so excited over the free phone she fainted. S ended up getting recognition for the director of our site and the executive head for customer care because of everything.\n\n\nMoral of the story: If you give an old person free stuff, make sure they are sitting down first.",

(I know customers lie, but i'd like to think of him as a rational and honest person)\n\nI do believe he has every right to be irate. However, reading all the stories fron all the tales from x subs, I have a better appreciation of employees who deal with the public.\n\nI reminded him that it's not the person's fault who is on the phone with so don't be an asshat to him. He apologized said he realizes it's not that guy's fault but he is just frustrated.\n\nI am sure me pushing my friend to be more civil made a difference to whoever he was talking with.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster here. Been working in call centers pretty much all my adult life so thought I would share a few snippets as well. \n\nThis one is from a few years ago when I worked for a mobile provider. I worked in a team that monitored customers who spent an especially large amount of money on their phone contracts or payasyougo cards with us and we would occasionally call them or text them with little gifts or incentives or offer special contracts to payasyougo customers. One day, our team picked up something strange. This one gentleman, in his early 60s, had 5 cards with us. One with a contract he was using and 4 payasyougo cards that havent been used since he activated them but were being topped up with enormous sums of money on a pretty much weekly basis. By then, the cards each had thousands of pounds (as in the british currency) on them but absolutely no calls or any other activity. I was asked to call the customer one day and inquire as to whether or not he would like a contract for those cards and perhaps find out why there is such an insane amount of money on them despite the lack of use. He proudly explained to me that his brilliant idea was to use the 4 payasyougo cards as savings accounts for his 4 grandkids. His plan was that he would just keep them in a cupboard (the simcards, not the kids), regularly top them up and one day, when the time was right, he would give them to his grandkids who would each ask for a full refund. A bit baffled and very amused, I've had to explain to him that THAT IS NOT HOW LITERALLY ANYTHING WORKS. You cannot just use a phone company as a bank. Once it dawned on him what I meant, he asked for a manager and the whole shitshow started. I later found out he went to court and was told that while we would not refund him ever, his grandkids were free to use the money already on the cards for texts, calls and internet at a discounted rate. And that is the story folks, perhaps I'll share a few more later.",

One of our regulars was a guy named Justin who's M.O. was to disconnect his prepaid account, then call in to customer service to say that he didn't authorize it and wanted his account reconnected and all the money put back on it. The catch being, he never put money on it, he just claimed he did and hoped he would get someone dumb enough to just credit an account.\n\nSo one night I get Justin pulling this same routine, saying his account was shut down and he wanted it back on with all the money on it. I review the account and check the last balance, which was un-shockingly at $0.00. I then cheerfully inform him that I can get the account reconnected successfully, though from what my review showed there hadn't been a balance on it.\n\nAt this, he goes quiet, and I figured with him being found out he'd just hang up. But the line is still connected, and I hear the familiar sounds of a cell phone being dialed, like he's texting or calling someone. I give him about 15 seconds where he doesn't say anything, after which I ask if he's still there.\n\nTo which he responds by yelling into my ear, top volume,\n\n\"I JUST HACKED YOUR COMPUTER\"\n\nand hung up. It took me a minute or two to recover from laughing.\n\nI imagine other overnight folks have similar stories, and this is just one of many that I have. Just felt like sharing one that I found particularly memorable.\n\n(ps I don't mind identifying him as Justin in this, mostly cause I'd known this guy buy at least 2 other names in my time there, none of which were real.)",

I'm literally looking at all your information but need verbal verification. I can see this guys address, his name, the items he ordered, his debt card, I have everything.\n\n\nCustomer: \"I'm not doing that, I'm just trying to find out about an order I placed.\"\n\n\nMe: \"I understand sir but I do need you to verify your information; its for security purposes.\"\n\n\nCustomer: \"How do I know you're not stealing my information?\"\n\n\nI'm just sitting there dumbfounded, he called an 800 number corporate hotline. He listened through the stupid menu music and the options and I clearly had an opening.\n\n\nMe: \"Sir you called me, we're the corporate office of blah blah at the 800 number; did you not call the 800 number?\"\n\n\nCustomer: \"You know what?

        "text": "I've said it before and I'll say it again, the worst calls always come right before you're due to finish.\n\nToday inverted that trend.\n\nI spent the entire day dealing with hard calls. Not that anyone was particularly entitled, but for whatever reason I kept getting people who had been on the phone for hours, through multiple departments, trying to figure out what was going on with their accounts, and it honestly would not surprise me if my AHT for the day hit four digits.\n\nWith 13 minutes to go, I got a call. When the guy came on line, he said in a light and pleasant voice that if he was in my position, he would answer with an angry \"What d'you want?!\" Sweet, I had a friendly joker.\n\nI took his details and found his account. A simple question, he had been given credit recently and wanted to know what his most recent bill would be, so I told him that. Three minutes, easy. What then followed was twelve minutes of this man making all sorts of jokes (in which I joined a few times), interspersed with his own rambling about how the company we work on behalf of is the best he's ever dealt with, and the call centres in particular are full of nice people. He also asked me how long I'd been working there; I decided to be honest and said I'd been here about three months, and he was amazed, saying I was more professional than people who had been in call centres for years.\n\nA couple of highlights from our conversation.\n\n----\n\n(Backstory: I am Canadian by birth, though have spent all but a smidgen of my life in Ireland).\n\n**Him:** I know why you left Canada.\n\n**Me:** Oh?\n\n**Him:** It's because  you heard about leprechauns and decided to catch one for its gold!\n\n**Me:** Yeah, but unfortunately as soon as I did the value of gold dropped, which is why I'm working in a call centre.\n\n----\n\n**Him:** Speaking of money, what happened to that million pounds I lent you 3 and a half billion years ago?\n\n**Me:** Oh, yeah, I, uh, definitely didn't spend all that money on drugs. You will definitely get  cheque in the next week.\n\n----\n\nI'm not that funny in most cases, but this guy made it really easy to joke and have fun, and he really seemed to appreciate Irish humour (which is something we pride ourselves on). Thanks, customer, for making my day (and I really hope you got a survey).",

It's actually a really fun place to work at. The people here are really nice, the atmosphere is great and the employees are treated like actual humans, which is a nice change from all these gas stations I used to work at.\n\nNow our customers are a mixed bag.\n\nSometimes you will get really nice customers that only need one thing from you and they ask it in a polite and curteous manner. \n\nOther times, we get entitled pricks that yell and threaten to cancel their service because they messed up somewhere and their over-inflated ego doesn't allow them to recognize their mistakes when I point them out, so they mention some other company like it's a secret tactic that will get them all the discounts. Not from me, anyway. I just transfer to retention.\n\nThis call was from a very rational father who had went over his data. Let's call him $gooddad\n\nMe: *Company name* my name is sirdante, may I have your full name please?\n\n$gooddad: Yes it's $gooddad\n\nMe: Thank you $gooddad *authentification questions blablabla*\n\n$gooddad: So, the thing is... I went to take a nap earlier and my son took my phone and went on YouTube with my data turned on... I know most of the time you can't do anything about this, but I need my data for work. I sent my son upstairs to think about what he did.\n\nMe: Oh well let me check how much data you've currently used *turns out he still had 1 GB left for 4 days so he was fine*\n\n$gooddad: Oh wow! I'm really glad to know that! What a relief. Hey listen I'm really sorry for wasting your time. \n\nMe: OH no! Don't worry about it, it's my job to help you after all! Anything else I can help you with?\n\n$gooddad: Yes actually, one second.  *Calls son* JIMMY COME DOWN HERE\n\nNow at this point, I kinda guessed why he was calling for his son to come down and I was really hoping I wasn't in for some sort of child abuse and I was ready to call 9-1-1 until I heard this:\n\n$gooddad: Tell the nice representitive that you're sorry for what you did and that you're also sorry for wasting his time\n\n$thecutestkid: Hello mister, I'm really sorry for wasting your time a-and I w-won't mess up again, I promise.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very impressed by this guy's parenting and congratulated him on it. Too many parents nowadays think that the correct way to discipline your kids is by hitting them. Not enough parents put in the time and patience needed to raise their kids properly.",

        "text": "I work as an operator for a well known company, one of the things you experience as a telephone operator are people who panic and hit zero instead of dialling 911, when we get these calls we have to process them and act as the first responders while conferencing them through to the appropriate line and handling much of the call on their behalf. \n\nHere are some of the calls I've handled in the last 2 weeks. \n\n\n1.)Last week I had a grandmother call, her 8 month old grandson was in the care of his meth addicted mother, the grandmother was crying and panicking because the child's mother allowed the small boy to eat tacks, and then left him in a bath tub. Getting this women to remain calm so I could get information was a challenge but I managed, however the baby was not fairing as well. I listened to this women cry and beg me to help her grandson and I wish I could of been there and helped more. We don't get to follow up but I do know that after that call I needed to walk away from my station just to collect myself, it's hard to hear a voice on the line and know that someone is in a life or death situation. \n\n2.) The majority of our calls come from the elderly and more often then not they are in assisted living facilities and have dementia, we still have to process their emergency calls as 911 calls and get help sent to them. I've had many elderly people cry on the phone with me because they are alone and scared and their own mind is haunting them but one call stood out to me. \nShe called in and got my line at around noon my time and 3 pm her time, she was very quiet and her breathing was laboured, she asked me to call 911 because she couldn't feel her legs as she had been left in her room sitting in her chair since 6 am, she hadn't been able to move to use the bathroom and she had been left sitting there for the whole day. She cried and told me \"there isn't any one here.. my family left me here and they haven't seen me since.. I thought I was doing the right thing by coming here.. they were supposed to take care of me.. I just want to go home.. no one is ever here..\" listening to an elderly women who was once vibrant and full of life breakdown and tell me that she was just left there broke my heart, she is someone's mother, she once looked after someone and changed their diaper and watched them grow and they just left her there, it wasn't a major emergency and sure her dementia could of been leading her to think no one has ever come but it doesn't make her words any less heart breaking for me.  \n\n3.) Most of the time the 911 calls we get the person is actually there and can give you information, this was not the case yesterday. \nI answer the line and notice that they are calling from my city, I say my opening line and waited for a response but a normal response never came, instead I heard a man screaming that he was going to kill someone, I heard the man beating the woman and her begging him to stop, I heard her try and fight back, I heard him tell her that he was going to kill her and her friend. As a victim of domestic abuse I knew what this was and I knew that even though I didn't know where they were that I had to do something. \nI grabbed my supervisor and she got on another phone and called 911 while I remaind on the line, transcribing the entire call so she could feed information to the police. \nI was on that call for 20 minutes listening to a woman scream and cry and begging for him to stop and him not stopping. \nIt ended when I heard the police arrive and I wish I knew the outcome. \n\nThe last one gave my nightmares last night. \n\nIt can be easy being an operator but there are days when it's not, but each day is a new challenge. \n\n",

        "text": "Hi TFCC!\n\nI used to work as a tele-fundraiser for my university, calling up alumni on weekday evenings and Saturday mornings. Now, I'm in Australia, and as a result of growing up here I have an Australian accent. However, my background is Indian, so on the phone, the only indicator that I was Indian was when I said my name. \n\nWe had a script to follow, starting at around $50 and we had to ask 4 times till we got down to $5 and practically begged for it. It wasn't a fun job, but as a broke student I did anything I could for a bit of money. People understandably would be upset with me and some people even resorted to screaming at me, or calling me names. \n\nNow on to the story. It was a Saturday afternoon and I was calling alumni one after the other as they came up in the automated software. An elderly lady picks up the phone and I start building rapport and chatting to her about what a lovely day it is. I then go on my fundraising script and she instantly agrees to donate. So I'm super happy because she hasn't kicked up a fuss and is willing to donate $50. I ask for her credit card details and note everything down. Then as I am thanking her and ending the call, she says this gem:\n\n\"I'm so glad you're calling from the university...at least you're not some Indian trying to get into my bank account! hahaha!\"\n\nI was too shocked to even say anything and I just hung up after she had. I looked at my manager who had been listening into the call, and her jaw was hanging open. I just burst out laughing, and it's one of my funniest memories of working at that place.",

I need to access her account before I can help. Name, address and order code. The call starts:\n\n* me: usual intro\n \n* Mrs Scream: This is mrs Scream. (loudly) Wheres my parcel. You took my money. I want my stuff now. I've been sitting home here for the last 2 days waiting. Why am I paying £x (really low value) to sit home all day waiting for this parcel. It's bad enough I'm paying your company £x when they hire foreign staff (She's in London, I'm in Scotland...not that foreign)\n\n* me: I'm sorry to hear you haven't got the parcel yet. Could you tell me the (she interrupts me before I can find her account info)\n\n* Mrs Scream: I told you my name it's *(proceeds to spell name slowly and over pronouncing each letter as if I couldn't understand)* you should have me on your system. \n\n* me: Thank you Mrs Scream. Could you also tell me your(interrupted)\n\n* Mrs Scream: I'm not giving any more details to you, I don't know you or what country you're in so you only get my name. I worked in a call before I know you can see my account.  You already have my name you can find me an your system.  *This goes on for about 5 minutes until I can finally get a word in between her ravings and we get her account details up. Turns out she ordered her really cheap item with 2 day delivery. Today was the delivery day and we told her that during and after she placed the order in big bold text.*\n\n* me: So you see, the order is on time and on the way right now. It'll be there soon.\n\n* Mrs Scream: (really screaming now) that's not good enough. You should have called me after the order was placed and said it would arrive today. You can't expect me to read the order details. I'm too busy and just want to order and don't have time for all that reading. I want to speak to your manager now. And don't connect me to one of those Indian.... *She stops talking on the phone at this point. I can hear her at her door and what'ya know, it's our parcel being delivered. I can hear her having an argument with the driver for a minute, then*\n\n* Mrs Scream: I got my parcel now, but I'm not happy. I paid £x and expect better service. The driver barely understood a word of English and was rude. I want a full refund and compensation for being abused and embarrassed. Connect me to your manager now. \n\nThat was the last I heard of her. Manager took the call and she didn't get a penny more from us. If she just read the delivery time at the order stage or email confirmation after, she could've avoided it all. ",

        "text": "Obviously, the title is grossly exaggerated, but that was essentially the attitude of this customer on this particular call. To give some background, tech support is the only department that is 24hrs where I work.Therefore, after 9pm, that's when all of the BS billing calls start rolling in. It's the most irritating part of the work day as billing calls seem to routinely consist of the most entitled and clueless people I've had the displeasure of speaking to. Case in point, this call. We'll call her IAC for irresponsible and clueless.\n\nBackground on the customer's issue: \n\nHer account had been temporarily disconnected because she was 60 days past due. She spoke with an agent a couple weeks before this call and scheduled a payment to go out on a specific date. The agent then manually restarted her account because she made a payment arrangement. A few days later her services stopped working again. And thus began the merry go round of fusterclucks that were any further conversations agents had to have with this customer. After being transferred several times, she finally gets me, and this is what transpired.\n\n*Call comes in without a screen pop*\n\nMe: Thank you for calling  [company], my name is GlissandosNTrills, how may I assist you today? \n\nIAC: Ok, this is ridiculous. I have been transferred like 10 times and my services are still out. I made my payment and they said it would be back on in 30 minutes. That was 2 hours ago and I keep getting the run around. I need my shit working. I have NO internet! NO TV and I'm getting fed up... (the complaining goes on for a few more minutes).\n\nMe: Well I'm definitely sorry to hear that your services are still down. Can I just ask a few questions to get the account pulled up?\n\nIAC: Fine.\n\n*After 7 minutes of waiting for her to get the needed information to pull and verify her account information, I finally get the account on my screen and see that it is no longer just temporarily disconnected for non-pay, it is now COMPLETELY disconnected and Collections has placed a block on the account. In other words, the account can't be restarted until Collections audits the account, confirms that all monies owed have been paid, and subsequently unlocks the address/account. Collections was closed, so there was nothing I could do except notate the account and give the customer the number to Collections. And then all hell broke loose.*\n\nMe: Ms. IAC, I see that at this time the account has been completely disconnected and that Collections has placed a hold on your account. I do see that a payment for [bill amount] was made today, so you are technically caught up at this point, but unfortunately, I'm unable to restart the account. So you will need to speak with Collections when they open. Did you want to get a pen and paper so that I can give you their number? \n\nIAC: (yelling) UH UH! Hold up! So y'all take MY money and tell me some bullshit just to get off the phone and now you telling me that I can't get my shit turned back on until I talk to collections???\n\nMe: Ms. IAC- (she cuts me off)\n\nIAC: First of all, if y'all had taken the money out of my account when you were supposed to this never would've happened... (More ranting...)\n\n*When she mentions this, I take the time that she is using to go on her rant to review the billing system and I notice something. She scheduled an ETF payment to go out on a Friday. A few days later the payment was returned and an insufficient funds fee was attached to the account. It was then that this triggered a complete disconnect of her account in the billing system. I mention this to her. And her explanation was absolutely baffling to me.*\n\nMe: So I see the scheduled payment was returned on [date] and a nonsufficient funds fee was attached to the account which then triggered the disconnect.\n\nIAC: (haughty and indignant) Yes. I scheduled that payment to go out on [date] and y'all didn't take it out when you were supposed to, so I spent it. Next thing I know, I'm getting an email saying my payment was returned and then my services were shut off.\n\n*At this point I'm a mixture of fed up, dumbfounded and annoyed with an ADULT that ADMITS she spent the money she scheduled to pay an already past due balance and had the nerve to think that it was our fault that it was returned because we didn't take the money out \"on time.\"*\n\nMe: (after a beat of silence to collect myself) Ms. IAC, you scheduled your payment to be withdrawn from your checking account on [date] which was a Friday. Usually, depending on your bank and the type of payment that is being made, it takes up to 1 business day for the payment to process and post to your account. Due to the fact that you scheduled your payment on a Friday, the next business day would've been that following Monday, which is when I see the payment attempted to process and was returned. Did you spend the money between Friday and that Monday?\n\nIAC: (silent and then suddenly husband is then put on the phone)\n\nMr. IAC: Yeah, hello...sorry...\n\nMe: Yes, so as I was explaining to your wife, if the money was scheduled to go out on a Friday, it can take up to 1 full business day for the ETF payment to go through. So that Monday.\n\nMr. IAC: (humble and ignoring his wife bitching in the background) Yeah, I understand. \n\nMe: So at this time, considering that your account is now being held by collections, the most I am able to do is notate your account to confirm that your payment was made today and give you their contact information. Would you like that information? \n\nMr. IAC: Yes.\n\n*The duration of the call was handled by her more level-headed husband while she continued to huff and puff in the background. At least one of them had good sense and knew that she had fucked up, basically, and caused her own problem by not budgeting properly. I also made sure to notate that the customer claimed that she spent the money because we didn't take it out on the date that she scheduled.*\n\nTL;DR: Customer fails to set aside her bill money, blames us for it, and I proceed to explain to her how life works.",

Without authorization, doctors don't get paid for their services. At least, not through the health plan. The vast majority of my calls are from people from the doctor's office who want authorization, start a case, and get approvals on the same call. This normally takes no more than ten minutes. Yesterday, one of my calls was notably different.\n\nMe: Thanks for calling, my name is Finnypoo. How can I help you?\n\nCaller: I need to see why my request hasn't been approved.\n\nMe: I'd be more than happy to look into that case and see what might be holding it up for you, sir. Can you just verify HIPAA and all that stuff?\n\nHe verifies HIPAA and I pull up his patient's info. There are no requests on file for this patient within the past 13 months. I ask him what code he was looking for because it might be a procedure that we didn't handle. He gives me two; one is a code handled by us and the other by the HP. I tell him that we don't have anything on file. Predictably, he freaks out.\n\nCaller: But I faxed it to you and I got this fax back! Let me read it to you. (Here I kind of stopped listening, honestly, but it was basically the HP telling him that he was asking for the wrong code and suggesting the code that we handle instead.) And then I faxed in the new request! How can it not be on file?\n\nMe: It appears we might not have gotten that other fax. Would you like to start a case with me so that we can at least get that started?\n\nCaller: Well how long would it take?\n\nMe: There's a chance that it could get approved on this call and I can always bring you to a nurse to discuss the clinical after we start.\n\nCaller: So should I cancel my patient's surgery? It's for tomorrow.\n\nHonestly, this is pretty common. A lot of doctors put it off until the last minute to get approval because I guess they don't understand that bureaucracy is a thing. That is, if they remember to give us a call at all.\n\nMe: If you aren't confident in your clinical, I would cancel the appointment, but that's up to you sir. I can start this case and it might be approve-\n\nCaller: I don't want to start from scratch. I already sent in that fax!\n\nIt goes back and forth like this for a few minutes. I explain that he's not actually calling the HP and we don't have the fax. He insists that he sent the fax to the HP and got a confirmation. I don't drop my customer service voice even though he's becoming increasingly unreasonable. In the end, it resolves like this.\n\nMe: Did you want me to bring you back to the HP to look for that fax?\n\nCaller: Yeah!\n\nMe: Okay is there anything else I can do for you?\n\nCaller: Only if you can approve this right now.\n\nMe: Okay, bye. -click-\n\nHe's going to have to call back to start a case so this patient can get their procedure done or the patient will end up with the whole bill. Actually, I'm pretty sure the patient will end up with the whole bill, considering how adamant the guy was about not starting the thing he needed to get this done.",

Do you have your order number?\n     \"Well, I'm about to enter my credit card information, so I don't have that yet.\"\n     Have you chosen a shipping method yet?\n     \"Oh, what are my choices?\"\n     * how can we look up your order, if you haven't actually clicked \"submit\" yet *\n\n3 - Phone call on Sunday morning\n     \"You jerks totally screwed up my event. I never got the tablecloth for Mother's Day!\n     I apologize for any inconvenience. Since today is Mother's Day, what is your zip code and the item?\"\n        I can look up the nearest store that has the tablecloth in stock.\n        Then when the package arrives with your tablecloth you should return it to a store for immediate refund.\n     \"It's not SOLD in stores! It's an online-only item! MY GOD y'all are a bunch of incompetent lazy asses!\"\n     * you knew Mother's Day was coming, everybody knew it's a Sunday, and you wait until DAY OF to call *\n\n(edited for formatting, I'm ready for that tutorial on how to get returns on ends of lines.)",
