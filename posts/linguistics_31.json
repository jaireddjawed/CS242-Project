A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).\n\n**Commenting rules**\n\nThe rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics. You don’t have to be a flaired user to answer questions, but we expect answers to reflect an expert level of knowledge. Please familiarize yourself with [**our commenting policy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1u9xsr/reminder_of_the_rlinguistics_commenting_policy/) and [**our subreddit rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/rules).\n\n**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**\n\nYour question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it. This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

For example in the US there is the \"vocal fry\", which is predominantly used by females. In Japan there are differences in intonation and language usage - both in terms of how females speak and are addressed.\n\nAre there any other examples as extremes as the Ubang people?",

        "text": "Something that hits me once in a while when looking at the distribution of modern languages is that these recent and massive expansions of certain languages - mostly English, French, Spanish and Portuguese - closely mirrors the historic spread of languages like Latin and Proto-Indo-European. You have a language, once spoken by a relatively small group of people, suddenly expand to a vast geographic area. Eventually, contact between distant groups of speakers becomes more rare, and it gets increasingly hard to maintain a single language. It happened with PIE, with Latin, heck, it even sort of happened with Dutch and Afrikaans. \n\nOn the other hand, however, some languages, like Arabic, have been surprisingly successful in remaining broadly unified, despite a wide geographic destribution over a large area. Some dialects, like Moroccan, are hard to understand, but in general, people don't talk about an Arabic language family like they do a Romance one. \n\nSo, how long do you think English and the other \"colonial\" languages will take before they start seriously breaking up? Do you think we are going to see a Romance/Indo-European-esque situation develop with these languages, or will it be more like Arabic? Lastly, if they do start breaking up, what geographical lines will they do it across? Will we see a single \"American\" or \"Australian\" language developing, or will, say Queensland and Tasmania end up speaking their own tongues within a few centuries?",

Usually the professor is of asian decent (Mostly Korean, Chinese, Indian) and teaching in English. There are already some programs out there, such as accent reduction programs (lol \"reduction\"..) that are targeted towards helping the teachers. I was curious if anyone might have an idea on how to approach this from a different angle. Specifically how to help students understand their Korean, Chinese, or Indian professors accent. Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this and especially to those who attempt to think of potential solutions.

        "text": "In L2 instruction, the teacher has to make a conscious decision about their speech rate. Do they speak in more or less normal tempo (so the learners get used to natural speech) or do they slow down to maximize listening comprehension. Is there any consensus in what is \"better\" (i.e. what helps learners more in acquiring the L2)? \n\nIn my experience, learners prefer a slower tempo, because they understand more, but a lot of instructors feel that it's more important to introduce (and maintain) a more or less natural/native speech rate early on. This is from learning situations where the learners live in a region where the L2 is spoken (so they do have a lot of contact with natural speech).\n\nDoes anyone know about research/have literature recommendations in that area? \n\nThanks in advance!",

I could apply these mappings to each phoneme in eg car pool, to get all possible phonetic strings which sound similar. Then I would search whether any of those phonetic strings appear in a dictionary - this gives the final output.\n\nMy question is: Is there a neat way to handle these phonetic mappings? I can imagine a list of these might exist somewhere?\n\nMy background is in maths - guidance is much appreciated! :)  \n(I wrote phoneme(s) because eg in \"got you\"  /ɡɒtjuː/ and \"gotchu\" /ɡɒtʃuː/, /tj/ and /tʃ/ can be swapped but we aren't only handling single phonemes)",

So \"the tables of Julius and Amelia\" refers to the set of tables owned by both of them, where \"the tables of Julius and of Amelia\" can mean the set of tables owned by Julius *along with* the set of tables owned by Amelia.\n\nBasically I'm just curious about the history here.\n\nI'm also curious how Latin would make a distinction between those two things (the last example with the plurals). Would one of them use a different construct than just having both possessors be genitive?",

        "text": "Some time ago I made a post at another reddit that got my tongue ripped out and branded me as ignorant beyond belief. I never got a chance to get myself out of the corner I seemed to have painted myself into. I hope to avoid that here, so I'll try to phrase my question(s) and comment(s) a little more intelligently.\n\nI said that English has a simpler/smaller inventory of sounds (I suppose phonemes is the word) than some other languages. Sanskrit, Icelandic/Old Norse come to mind. For example, The name Krishna which seems simple enough is not pronounced that way, as commonly done. It's spelled **kṛṣṇaḥ**  **कृष्णः** (nom. sing. masc.) and pronounced something like krushnaha, with the 'ru' being almost like the 'oo' in hoof, the s and n curling the tongue, and the final 'ha' being more like a puff of air with an almost inaudible 'a''. The 'a' are actually schwas. As far I've seen the retroflexes in Sanskrit can make your tongue get DOMS.\n\nAs an English-speaker for 61 years (OK, 59 if I started talking around 2 years old) I can't ever remember needing to use those sounds, or the **öll i**n **Mjöllnir** and **Eyjafjallajökull** (Icelandic: [\\[ˈeiːjaˌfjatl̥aˌjœːkʏtl̥\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Icelandic)  (Wiki article) speaking English.\n\nI understand that it's not that English speakers *can't* make those sounds, it's just that English doesn't *use* them, therefore its inventory is smaller.  Not to mention that they are kind of hard for an English speaker to pronounce, hence an accent I suppose. That was my contention. Anyone care to set me straight or expand?   ;-)",
