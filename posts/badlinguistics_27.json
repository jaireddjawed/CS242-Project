Eats, Shoots, and Leaves was my Bible, and the permanent marker on signs my weapon (okay I never actually vandalised stuff but I did correct my own books), but I got out of it. To this day I still internally cringe when I hear less instead of fewer or see an its/it's mistake.\n\nI've been a jackass and I've been rightfully called out for it. I've been called things from asshole to Grammar Nazi to reactionary, and I always dismissed the people who said that as stupid, ignorant, or misguided. Holy fuck was I pretentious. I was also convinced to use British spellings every time (e.g. colour, favour, centre). Part of this is probably due to me being Canadian, but I still do it to this day. Another weird thing I did and still do was write Ws as two overlapping Vs. Why, I have no clue; it takes longer and is pointless, but I do it anyway. I think partially it was because it looked cool to me.\n\nAnyway, I've come about now, and joined the descriptivist ranks. What I think happened was I got into conlanging, something which by its very nature requires a bit of prescriptivism, and I got further into linguistics and now I want to take it in university, as I learned more about linguistics and descriptivism. I always knew it was \"the study of language\" but I missed the part about \"and how it is used\". I got grammarians with dictionaries up their asses confused with linguists interested in how people talk and write. It was also about this time I discovered /r/conlangs and /r/badlinguistics, but for some bizarre reason I was under the impression the two subs hated each other due to descriptivist vs prescriptivist ideologies. I have no fucking idea where I got that from, but I get it now. I get that linguistics is about descriptivism.\n\n/r/badlinguistics, you've helped me stop being a pretentious twat, and I thank you for that.",

        "text": "Ok. I am sure you have not heard of this stuff. I found out about Finnish artist, Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa (1870-1946), who was a sculptor and painter. He was also a writer, poet, composer, musician, inventor, architect and freemason. He also had interest towards linguistics and Egyptology.\n\nIt seems he was not appreciated as an artist by all, and some considered his art to be exemplar of “degenerate art”, “jewish” and “Bolshevistic”. Finland had German sympathies (most officers from the winning side of our civil war had had their training in Germany and in the IIWW we were allies of the Germany). Interestingly, although his art was considered to be “degenerate”, he himself had sympathies towards national socialism. On the other hand, we had had some kind of “kultur-kampf” between Swedish and Finnish nationalism, afore mentioned thinking that Swedish-German culture was superior against Finnish culture (considered to be Slavic-Mongol in origin), whereas the latter wanted to prove that Finnish culture was just as good (if not better) than Swedish culture.\n\nTherefore Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa developed his own, rather peculiar theory about the origin of Finnish people, language and culture. He theorized that we were originally from Java, travelled through India and ended up in Egypt. From Egypt, during centuries, different splinter-groups leaved and formed the foundation of different cultures in Europe. Finally, some “pure” group ended up in Baltic Sea and Finland. This theory he called “Fenno-Egyptian theory”. Therefore Greek, Latin, Celtic and also German culture owed their accomplishments to us Finns.\n\nTo support this theory he developer a rather peculiar linguistic method to unravel the etymology of words. He called this method “intuitive permutation”. Here are some examples of rather hilarious invented etymologies:\n\nBerlin = Perälinna (Rump-borough)\n\nEgypt = Äijäkupittaa (Old man’s barterplace), also, Egyptian word “Khemet” comes from Finnish word “Keminmaa”, “Riverland”\n\nTunisia = Tuonensija (Tuoni’s place/restplace, Tuoni is Finnish god of death)\n\nprince (“prinssi” in Finnish) = piirinseppä (district’s smith)\n\nlabyrinth = läpiriento (runthrough)\n\nMarseille = Merisäiliö (Sea container)\n\nzebra = seurahepo (companion horse)\n\nculture = kultaura (golden track)\n\npyramid = pyhätraamit (holy/sacred frames)\n\nHispania = Hiisipainijanmaa (land of Giant wrestler)\n\nmänniskor (Sw. “man”) = maannussija (soil-fucker)\n\nVenice = Venesija (place of boats)\n\nBuckingham = Pukinhammas (Goat’s tooth)\n\nParis = Parisaari (twin island)\n\nAbu Simbel = Simpele (place name in Finland)\n\nzenith = säännitoma (weatherknot, or knit by weather)\n\nLeipzig = Leipäsija (place of bread)",
