The layer would deflect 100% of incoming sunlight and hence cast a shadow on the earth below.\n\nProblem is that such sheet can not be to broad longitudinally, as it would drift towards a pure equatorial orbit. My interest in a back of the napkin calculation speculating on carrying \"towers\" that keep the reflective material suspended in large squares or hexagons, relative to the orbital equator. In other words, can massively long support beams be used to widen the reflective shielding, and if so \n\n1 - how wide can the reflective orbital structure be made and\n2 - how much can temperatures be reduced under the solar blanket. \n\nI am trying to get an idea whether or not in such an elaborate contrivance an \"equatorial ice cap\" would be feasible. I suppose not (the shielding would still emit massive amounts of infrared). \n\n*Edit*: No tower reaches space from the ground. There is no connection between the ground and space. Nothing of this construction reaches the atmosphere. It is in orbit. Here are a few sketches of what I mean.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KkuQQv9.jpg\n\nIt's a sunscreen in orbit around earth. My objective is to make it as north/south (longitudinally) as wide (broad) as possible. to maximize the size of the shadow cast on the Equator. Problem is the material will drift to an equatorial orbit unless held taut by \"masts\" or \"towers\". These towers do not touch Earth's surface. They are in orbit at a 90 degrees angle north south to the equatorial plane. ",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nSo I was wondering if of the top your heads, there is any one good place to start. I am essentially auditing a graduate level physics course after my astronomy professor who I had for 4 semesters suggested that I join. My astronomy classes were mostly conceptual and were the undergrad level. I had no idea I would love astrophysics so much because the first course I took was just a suggestion of my advisor to fulfill one of my science requirements. I am a french major, so I only am required to do 6 hours of sciences and the labs. Well, I found out how much I loved it and kept taking more until I ran out of courses to take. My professor who I had for all of these courses knew that I really loved the subject but worried as to whether I could handle the math. You see I haven't taken any math yet in college. I had been putting that off bc I didn't want to deal with it. So fast forward, I'm about to take this class where although I'm familiar with the conceptual aspect, aside from labs, I haven't dealt with equations. I know it can be hard, but I am so determined to make myself understand all of it because I really want to pursue this someday. I know if I could thrive in this class--in that I mean, be able to do the problems on my own and understand how to solve everything, I will feel so much better about the math I have to catch up on in order to get into physics in order to then go into ASTRO.  This would really boost my confidence in my ability. \n\nThe course is called \"Stars and Stellar Evolution\" see course description:\n\n\"This course is intended to facilitate a fairly complete understanding of stars, including their structure, evolution (formation, stages of burning, end states), synthesis of elements, and the physical processes involved in each of these, as well as introduce the modern computational modeling techniques used to apply stellar physics to stars.  For astronomy students, this course will provide the background necessary to understand the underlying principles of stellar processes and modelling as they are used both in ongoing research into stellar physics and phenomena and in support of other areas of astronomical research where stellar populations, products and processes are important.  In a broader context, relevant for any physics student, this course will discuss how understanding the physical principles in fluids dynamics, high-density materials, heat transfer, plasma physics, nuclear structure, and nuclear processes are assembled into our modern understanding of how stellar objects behave, and how the study of stars pushes the frontier of understanding in these areas of physics.\"\n\nWhat's the first thing I should look up? I'm more concerned with equations and explanations rather than context of solar fusion. I took a class in the spring that went a lot into the conceptual aspects of this. I know that will def help my broader understanding.\n\nToday for example we discussed the Hydrostatic Balance and wrote out the equations for Isothermal Atmosphere\n\nI need like a source that tells me what all the letters mean in some of the equations.  so like a symbol dictionary for equations in essence. I'm searching on my own as well\n\n\nThanks for any recommendations! ",

For example, the ACT (a standardized test) most astrophysics majors score 32+ while I score a 28. They are levels ahead of me on math, while I am stuck in the basic calculus class offer at my university. I am an incoming freshman, and yet I am afraid of saying that my intended major is astrophysics because I would be laughed at. The simple truth is that there are a lot better candidates for this major, and I am simply too stupid and unworthy to persuade it. Even though I love nothing more in life...the reason why I post this is that I hope someone can offer some advice in what I should do. Thank you for your patience.   ",

        "text": "Now that Stephen Hawking is throwing support to a serious search for extraterrestrial life, I'd like to throw a major monkey wrench in the works. My personal (and somewhat expert opinion) on the matter is that the whole search method we have employed is incorrect. The search has been looking for RF carriers (very narrow-band sine waves) at interesting frequencies. I believe this is absolutely wrong. Start with a few assumptions (yeah, I know).\n1. If we are looking for radiation leakage (not strictly intended for the purpose of being discovered by non-locals), then we need to be looking for modulated signals. Playing guessing games about type of modulation is going to be very difficult, so I really wouldn't want to tackle that.\n2. If we are looking for evidence that a non-terran intelligence is transmitting with the express purpose of being discovered, then let's get very, very serious about it.\n3. If someone wants to transmit a signal expressly for the purpose of discovery, the let's assume THEY are serious.\n4. Under that assumption, the other party will spend some time and effort (which doesn't cost much) to maximize the probability of detection of their signal (and I'm going to assume the generation of the signal is expensive).\n5. If we really think they're smart, and that they assume we're smart, then we're going to play an information theory game. What signal design for a given transmitter power maximizes the probability of detection under the assumption that transmitting party and receiving party are both playing this game.\n6. This turns into an eigenvector problem in the signal design space, yielding a fairly broad spread-spectrum type signal. The spectral characteristics are fixed by the optimization problem, while the temporal characteristics are not.\n7. Given that the temporal characteristics are not fixed, we again play a game. Given that there is no communication, what temporal characteristics will maximize the likelihood of detection? Detection is maximized by coherent averaging (+3dB over incoherent averaging), which implies that the signal must be cyclic.\n8. Given a cyclic, broadband signal of known spectral characteristics, what cycle times should we seek? Here is where I do some handwaving, because there is no actual optimization problem here. I would suggest, though that there are some likely choices for the period of the signal, and I'd begin with pulsar repetition rates.\nOkay. I HOPE I got some folks thinking here.",

Because I am learning and reading independently (not part of school or any program), I was looking for any insight on how to do this.\n\nIn my mind, some sort of applied research problem that could encompass a lot of the issues covered in chapters 1-6 would be ideal, but I'll need some advice on a specific topic/problem? I am also open to different ideas or suggestions. My apologies for the vagueness, but I am really just looking for a way to deepen my overall understanding of this material before moving on.\n\nAn alternative idea that I had was developing a \"mock\" presentation on one or many of these topics. There was a lot of information, so I would likely have to limit the content significantly. Verbalizing and explaining often helps me really understand concepts. I could subject my wife to sitting through my \"mock\" presentation...\n\nFor reference, the topics in chapters 1-6 include the topics seen on this table of contents:\nhttp://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0613/2006015391.html\n\nThanks for any help, advice, or suggestions!",

I'm curious though to find out, of the 90% that is ionized hydrogen, is there a majority one-way or the other in the distribution of protons to electrons? \n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the cosmic rays are about 90%~ protons, so my immediate assumption is that the solar wind is mostly hydrogen protons. Still, I don't think I need to make any assumptions given the number of spacecrafts we've sent into space and through the heliosphere, particularly Voyager 1. I just can't seem to find any data from those measurements.\n\nIf anyone can, please let me know whether there is a majority of protons, electrons, or an equal distribution.

I love reading and learning astronomy/astrophysics in my free time, so this book seemed like a great resource. I've made my way through the first 3 chapters of text and problems and am really impressed with the quality of book so far.\n\nRecently, I looked up some examples of course syllabuses that rely on this text - in an effort to understand a logical progression through the book. Currently I am just going from beginning to end, but wanted to get some additional insight into what a logical sequence of chapters might be for this book.\n\nIn the context of an introductory astrophysics course, what would you suggest? The two links provide an example of two different approaches I found online. If anyone has any insight based on experience in school, etc, it is greatly appreciated! \n\nhttp://people.physics.tamu.edu/allen/astrophysics.html\nhttp://www.physics.usu.edu/shane/classes/astrophysics/\n\nTo summarize/clarify my question: What sort of sequence through the Big Orange Book would you suggest for someone looking to learn the material in a similar way to a college course?\n\nThanks for any help and advice!",

        "text": "I am writing this after reading numerous posts online directed towards the same issue. If there is another thread addressing this, apologies. \n\nA hypothetical that I keep coming across when trying to understand special relativity and how it is understood to evaluate time dilation, is the \"light clock\" scenario. \n\nIn this scenario, two light clocks are built on earth in a lab. An emission of light is shot up the light clock and when it returns back down that same clock, exactly one second has passed. One of the two light clocks is sent into space, on board a space ship traveling close to the speed of light. \n\nAs explained in the commentary following these passages, the light clock on the space ship would take longer to tick a second than the clock on earth. The reasoning behind this time dilation is provided in relation to the \"distance\" traveled by the light emission. \n\nEarth light clock emission - Only has to go up and then down \nSpaceship light clock emission - Has to go up and then across and then down and across (Because it is following the movement of the ship) \n\nIf the pilot of the speed of light spaceship were to spend a couple of days at the speed of light, he would return to earth and find that a great deal more than two days had passed on earth. \n\nWhat troubles me is how absolutely poor is this examples focus on a \"light clock.\" I can honestly say I have been considering this example for a couple weeks now and still am scratching my head. I would greatly appreciate if someone could apply this same theory in a more apparent manner. It makes sense that the light would have to travel farther and that therefore will take longer, time slows down. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BODY, A NON-LIGHT RECOGNIZING WRISTWATCH?!?! \n\nHere is what I am thinking is the answer; The body will react the same (age slower) because at the foundational level, the principles are consistent. By that I mean, when our body ages, it is still at a molecular level similair to the light watch. When a body ages, a molecule or biological component is STILL having to MOVE in a certain direction. Because the spaceship pilot's body is moving at the speed of light, the molecular movements that his body makes which causes him to age, must move a greater distance because while moving in their respective directions, they are covering all of that distance inherent in traveling the speed of light. \n\nOr if the space pilot was to count out loud to himself \"One Mississippi\" \"Two Mississippi\" while traveling at the speed of light, it would still take longer for him to do so, because there is still a great deal of molecular movement going on in his body when he makes that vocalization with his mouth. \n\nThank you for any feedback.

As an object's speed increases in any frame, it *also* experiences time-dilation. The event horizon of an idealised black hole forms at the radius from the central point at which the acceleration due to gravity is equal to the speed of light.\n\nMy question is, how much of an in-falling object's time-dilation is due to the object's increasing speed as it falls into the hole, and how much of it is due to the curvature of the local space-time, the *strength* of the gravity field it is in?   \nIf the object could counter-thrust enough to hold itself up stationary against the pull of the hole (prior to hitting the event horizon), would it experience \"no\" dilation compared to the relatively flat space beyond the hole's significant influence?  \n(If yes - does that mean it would have a *lower* effective event horizon? My mind is tying in knots with that one...)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n ^(EDIT: I'm starting to realise that the area-of-effect of *velocity*-based TD and *gravity*-based TD is different... *gravity* slows time across a *volume* of space causing anything in that volume to slow down relative to the outside universe, whereas *velocity* slows time *in* the moving object - the progress of the object doesn't slow from the viewpoint of the objective reference frame. So the outside observer watching something fall into the black hole won't see any \"deceleration\" from the object's velocity-based TD, only from the gravitational TD of the hole... have I got that right?)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n#2  \n**Hawking radiation.**  \nAs one nears an event horizon, the universe fast-forwards behind them. From the objective observer's viewpoint, far from its space-time distortion, the Black Hole shadow will shrink to nothingness over the course of quintillions of septillions of years (or whatever) - but from the faller's perspective, quintillions and septillions of years will pass in the blink of an eye as they fall towards the Event Horizon - so... is Hawking radiation (and the quantum instabilities that enable it) independent of the reference frame, or will a black hole's own time-dilation arrest the effect and extend the hole's lifespan essentially to eternity?\n\nIf it's independent - does that point to a base-level absolute \"quantum time\" that might be a solid reference frame for all of space-time? In other words: Is relativity only relative above the Quantum level?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: tightened up some phrasing and added some subtext musing.",
