I’ve noticed a lot of repeat motifs in photographs or videos of seemingly normal people doing mundane normal things. But just behind them, slightly left or slightly right, are creepy faces caught peeking around the back of someone’s head; as if they are standing directly behind them and almost attached to them. What do you think are these entities?? I don’t think they’re our twin from an alternate dimension… most don’t look anything like the front person. But always caught peeking with a sliver of an eye, corner of the mouth, usually a partial eyebrow.. definitely a face of someone. But what or who are they? Why do they seem attached to the back of the front person or using them in some way to manifest. There’s just way too many instances of this phenomenon in some many pictures and videos from various time periods for it not to be a thing. What do you think?",

        "text": " maybe this is not the right place to write this, but i really had no idea where else to post it,  I'm not really a person who believes in creepypasta stories or the like, but all that changed a few days ago.\n\n Some time ago, more exactly about 3 years, I went on vacation with some relatives, everything was going well until we passed a place where I found a usb lying on the street, I'm somewhat curious so I decided to pick it up and take it home with me, When we got back I checked it, although I didn't care what it contained, I only remember that there were 2 folders that had photos and files that I didn't recognize, so I used it to store school files without paying attention to the rest. \n\n A year ago I was curious and I started to review again what the USB contained, the photos were of a group of people who seemed to be in a school doing I don't remember what activity, and some files that I did not recognize, I decided to delete everything and when I checked it later, I found that a folder still existed, I checked it and it turned out that there was the known creepypasta, Sonic.exe \n\n I didn't believe in those things since I knew they were just fiction, but even so I wanted to play it, just to see how it was, it turns out that it is exactly how it is told in the story, the empty map, the worried characters, etc., I finished playing only after losing tails since my parents called me and I decided to close the game, but I couldn't, nothing besides the game responded and I couldn't close the game in any way, the only thing left was to turn it off and leave it without turning on for a while time, and I decided not to tell anyone in case something bad happened, it turns out that some time later they had to take the laptop on which I played sonic.exe with a technician because they had said that it supposedly had a virus, something strange since it had an antivirus installed But that's not the point. \n\n for about a month after playing it I had very bad luck, and also strange things that happened to me, sometimes I used to hear voices when I was alone at home, or strange noises and so on, luckily it calmed down and I didn't hear about it again, until now... \n\n It turns out that a few days ago I found the usb in my room again, and since it's the last days of school I decided to play the complete game in the computer room at school, all so that a friend would be with me watching (for what reason? the truth I don't remember), the game started just as I remembered, with the animation of sonic waving on the screen and then showing a screenshot of sonic.exe, to be honest I was a little afraid to play it again because I thought something would happen to me bad, but I just wanted to get rid of that doubt about whether the game could really cause bad things like in the story. \n\n I managed to finish the game and as I expected, when trying to exit the image of sonic.exe appeared on the entire screen with its mythical phrase: \"i am god\", I turned off the computer hoping it would work to close the game, but it did not work , when I turned it on again the game was still open and I was scared because, what would happen if a teacher arrives and sees that, so I disconnected the computer and took the usb with me hoping that nobody would notice, but since then the same things happened to me again. The first time I played it, I feel watched on every side I go and I can't be calm, and not only me, also my friend who I was with says that she has felt the same as me, and to be honest I'm worried, yesterday I found a dead bird with no eyes in front of my door on my way out, and maybe I'm being a bit paranoid but come on, what kind of person wouldn't think a bit about that after playing a supposedly \"cursed\" game, every time everything gets worse, I've been waking up about 3 a.m. for no apparent reason and I have constant nightmares, I know that almost no one or respectively no one will believe me but I feel better somehow when I say this here...",

I live down the street from my office so I stopped by my house real quick to see my dogs, since I knew I would be gone a while. On my way there an SUV ran a stop sign across two lanes, another car  in the opposite lane and I just missed this person. It’s been down pouring rain, high winds for two days and the weather alone felt eery enough, and some areas are even flooded in the state right now. So I make it to the party a bit shooken up. There was a banquet and our tables were numbered. I got a text from my coworker that she was sitting at table 19, I sat and started to eat my salad that was already placed at our tables, while a few of my coworkers start talking about raffles. Then all of a sudden the number in the middle of our table that no one touched, no one moved, no one bumped into, the number and it’s base jumped on its own about 4 inches up and 4 inches over from where it was originally placed. Some people at the table say “ok” and continue their conversation about the raffle. I put the number back where it had been, before it jumped. I finished my salad and I look at my coworker from my department, I ask her “Is it just me or did that number just jump on it’s own?” She shrugged “Yeah, it moved on its own, I saw that”, my response was “Great, I am not crazy.”",

        "text": "Im posting this on a throwaway because I don’t want my friends to think I’m crazy. I’m from Madawaska, Ontario. Because of this I’m a very outdoorsy person and I visit Algonquin park constantly every summer break. This story happened last may, soon after I got back to my home town from university. It had been since winter break that I last explored Algonquin, so I was itching to get out there after seeing my family and unpacking my stuff. The next few days would be extremely rainy but I didn’t care. A day after I came home I drove into the park and decided to hike the mizzy lake trail. It’s a roughly 12 kilometre trail that loops in between many marshes, lakes and wetland.\n\n\n\nI arrived at the trailhead and got moving. It had started raining pretty hard earlier in the morning and it was pretty nippy out, about 8 degrees Celsius which was colder than average this time of year. This was okay cus I had my rain gear. The first couple hours were pretty normal, I saw a moose in the tree line at mizzy lake itself. When I reached wolf howl pond along the abandoned railway is when stuff got off.\n\n\n\nI don’t know why but the temperature seemed to drop very rapidly, it felt like the negatives. In the distance I saw another hiker walking in my direction, I thought nothing of it at first, but as she got closer I saw she was a young girl looking about ~9 years old. This was pretty weird, she was all alone. She also wasn’t wearing any rain gear, she just had an absolutely soaked hoodie and a backpack. She was pretty pale and was shivering a lot. When we met I asked her where her parents were, she didn’t answer verbally but kinda just shrugged. I asked if they were ahead of her when she last saw them and she nodded.\n\n\n\nThis was odd because nobody passed me on the trail, I hadn’t seen anyone period. If they went up ahead of her, I would have passed them first before finding her. I suppose they could have made a turn when the trail merged with the rail line but the rest of the line doesn’t really go anywhere. I gave her my extra raincoat, a small compact camouflage one I always have in my pack and use for hunting. I also gave her an emergency blanket for retaining heat. I told her that she should come with me to the trailhead, when her parents realize she’s missing that’s probably where theyll go. It would also give me better cell reception so I could call someone for help. She nodded we started moving.\nAbout 2 seconds later, I turned my head back to ask her for her name and she literally wasn’t there. I was shocked for a couple of seconds. There wasn’t anywhere for her to go, we were on an elevated trail (an old rail bed) with water on both sides of us. There was no forest, and I didn’t hear any splashing. I checked both ditches like 3 times in my confusion. She just disappeared into thin air and took my favourite hunting jacket with her. I reported this to park authorities but they didn’t seem to take it seriously. Nobody believes me.",

It has appeared in 3 deferent form or for all I know it could have been 3 separate entity’s. \n\nIt all started not long after I moved in a new home. In the early days it never showed it self, I would just get a feeling of being watched any time I went near my bedroom window. It didn’t really bother me back than as I just wrote it off as being paranoid. After about a year I would start to see it in corner of my eye, but it would dart on to the roof as soon as I would look at it.\n\nI will describe it to the best of my ability since I’ve never gotten a good look at this one. It has pale whiteish-blue skin so skinny you can see it’s bones and has bright white pupil less eyes. \n\nI eventually got rid of it by placing salt in front of my window, and that got rid of it for about a year. However when it returned it came back, it came back stronger than before.\n\nI would start to hear a little girls voice calling my name as I would try to fall asleep, though I’m not sure if this was connected to this thing or something else. As well as this I would hear whispering in my ears and scratching at my bedroom door. ( I don’t own any animals )\n\nNot long after this I a human face in my window when I woke up, the man I saw was wearing a black cloak, he had a vary cultist look about him. But the part that freaked me out the most was that one I looked at it just stared straight at me and turned it’s head slightly. Once I recovered from shock, booked it down stairs and hid in the basement. When I come back up stairs it was gone.\n\nThe next night the same thing happened except that it was like half goat have man it’s fur was all jet, and it looked like it was muttering something under its breath.\n\nI’ve only seen one other thing in the time since then and that was shadow though the curtains well I was showering, but it disappeared when opened the curtains.\n\nIf anyone has had similar experiences or has any idea what I might be dealing with I would greatly appreciate you reaching out to me.",

        "text": "\nI am going to tell you something that has been bothering me for quite some time. Right now I am convinced that this is not just illusions that happens in my head. I never tell anyone about this before because I doubt people would even believe what I said. But now I can't keep this to my self alone anymore and I decided to make this thread.\n\nI've been noticing something peculiar that happen when I tried to recall any of my past memories, specifically the one when there are other peoples in it. It could be any memories that happened in my real life, a scene from a movie or other sources. \n\nThe strange thing is they are not my original or actual memories like they should be anymore. They are still my past memories like before but there is something different. When I tried to recall that kind of memories, I've been noticing something surprising with the **peoples** in them. I don't know how the best way to describe this but I think I could say that they are **alive**. What I mean by alive is that they are capable **to change**. Change from their original state. It could be their **speeches** or **motions** but they are **different** from what they are supposed to be. This phenomena really caught my interest.\n\nAt first I think I might be hallucinating stuff but there are reasons that made me change my mind. It is because even though they are quite vague, I could still make out the contents of their speeches and sometimes they corresponds with what I'm thinking at the time. That is they are responding to my monologue.\n\nMy realization of this really surprised me and it made me change my perception of our world because this phenomena has so many implications. I could elaborate this further but first I want to know if this happen to other people too. I want you to check and clarify this thing yourself. That is experimenting with your own memories.\n\nHere I will explain how to do this correctly step by step.\n\n1. Find a quite place where you could concentrate and focus without any disturbance.\n\n2. Take a deep breath and calm yourself down.\n\n3. Pick and recall a memory from a distant past that you could recall quite vividly. It need to have other peoples in them. Preferably the ones who are talking. People who had a conversation with you, a dialogue in a movie or a talk show, a reporter of a news channel, a narrator or other memories with similar nature.\n\n4. Focus and take extra attention to the people *(this is important)* and said a word in your head (like apple or any other words of your preference would do). Both of this should happen at the same time in a second.\n\nIf you do this correctly, you might be able to notice the changes that happen to the peoples in your memory. Please do this several times and tell your experience about it here.",

I hooked one of my boyfriend's dog, G, up first to take out.. I clearly remember struggling to turn his collar.. I then decided to fill the water bowl before taking him out. It took a little longer than usual bc after filling a bit, I noticed stuff floating, so dumped some out and had to wait to refill again. He was walking around a bit behind me, waiting for me. Then stopped for a few seconds and when he started again, it sounded like he was really dragging something. I put the bowl down and see that G now has on my dog's collar and leash! I stood there like, wtf. G's leash is very different from my dog's and it leaves my hands feeling weird for a little after touching it.. and my hands felt that way. Like, I know I put his stuff on him.\n\nI also tried turning my dog's collar on him, and it was bigger than his is, so if I had put my dog's collar on him, I wouldn't have struggled turning it the first time. \n\nIt was really bizarre as nothing like this has happened there before! I have gotten a feeling of someone or something else there from time to time, watching..but that's it. I don't mind whatever messing with me, just don't scare my pups please!

        "text": "I had indirect paranormal experiences before where I was in the room and missed it while everyone saw it but this was my first direct experience. \n\nI am a 4th year university student who lives in the dorm, every year I usually get 3 new roommates. This year, I had 2 new roommates from Thailand. The first thing we bonded over was our fascination with paranormal stories and later on we started talking about spirits, energy and religion overall. They explained to me that Thailand is a very spiritual country, even though the majority of the population are Buddhists, Thailand has a lot of spirit gods that they worship. One particular thing that interested me during the conversation was when they explained to me that some Thai people carry around a little statue that has a ghost baby trapped in it, and it’s a form of protection from evil spirits. One of my roommates(lets call her Jo) said that she have two spirit babies protecting her. I asked her if she communicates with them and she said yes, back home she said she can hear them whispering to her ear, following her around the house etc, but the crazy part to me was that these ghost babies would throw tantrums when they were upset. Jo said one of her babies do not like Coke and spilled the entire drink on the floor after she placed it infront of it’s statue, but no tantrums occured when Fanta was served. So, the ghost baby is a big fan of Fanta but not Coke. \n\nI am an active dreamer, I had dreams where I would travel through different timelines, dimensions, fantasy world etc. I had few dreams where I met some deceased relatives in limbo or I would just dream about future events and have a deja vu moment when it actually happens in real life.  I am adding this part to say it’s not my first weird dream.\n\nAnyways, a month later, Jo got covid-19 and she had to be quarantined alone in a different room and the rest of us had to be quarantined together in a different room for having close contact with her while the dorm staff disinfected our actual room. We had to stay in quarantine for 7 days and during one of those nights, I had a dream about one of Jo’s ghost baby. \n\nIn the dream, we were all chilling in our dorm room and we heard a frantic footsteps in the hallway, we knew exactly who it was, like it’s one of those dream feeling where you know in your gut you know who it is but you don’t actually know this person in real life. That’s the feeling I got from the footsteps. Once it got to our door, the baby started crying, yelling and aggressively pounding the door. It was really intense that we thought the baby was about to break the door open. The baby was screaming at us to let him in(it was a boy baby) and the aggression got worse as we waited longer. One of my roommates pushed me to open the door to comfort the baby so he can leave us alone. I was terrified. I took a deep breath, walked towards the door and opened it. Of course, a little baby boy was crying outside the door and he was sobbing that how we were ignoring him and wouldn’t play with him. I remember I was shaking, completely terrified but I put up my best big sister smile and comforted him and played rock, paper, scissors with him. Eventually, the baby stopped crying and was smiling and giggling. That put comfort in me and i was no longer scared of his presence. Then the baby asked me if we can play again, I told him yes and that’s when I woke up. WHEN I TELL U I ALMOST SHIT MY PANTS AFTER I WOKE UP BC I REALISED WHAT I DREAMT ABOUT.\n\n\nWhen the quarantine was over, I told Jo about my dream but i did not tell her it was a boy baby, I just said “the ghost baby”when I was done, Jo asked me whether it was a boy or a girl baby and I said “a boy”. Jo goes silent for a second and then she tells me that, she has two ghost babies at home back in Thailand, a boy and a girl and Jo’s mom asked the boy baby to go to (the country we are in) to protect her when she got covid.😳",

        "text": " \n\n So this is a long one. and a bit long winded. But I have never been able to make sense of this experience and it terrifies me to this day thinking about it. I remember the pure fear I had in the moment while this all went down.\n\n  A few years ago in October my fiancé(then boyfriend)and I took a trip to a city in our home state about 2 hours away. During that trip we drove to his grandparents house to hangout with them on the last day of our vacation. The city they lived in was 3 hours away from our hometown. We stayed pretty late at his grandparents but got on the road to go home around 10 pm. We were driving down a major interstate, everything was fine, and then I notice a cars’ headlights were facing me and I started to slow down. A few moments later I see the car had just hit a deer and its body parts were all over the road. I tried to swerve but I still ended up hitting some of the deer. So we were both pretty freaked out by that time because it was a jarring experience. We begin to approach our exit to get onto another freeway and I started to get this really weird feeling, the exit split off into 2 different sections, one on the right that curved, and one on the left that continued straight.  The GPS kept repeating it’s self saying “continue straight” over and over… I made almost complete stop at both of these cross roads because something was telling me to go right where the road curved, not straight. But the GPS kept repeating “go straight” so I did… And this is where things get weird. Prior to this we were jamming out to music to get us hyped up for this long ride home and something I didn’t notice at the time because I was too freaked out was that the music had completely stopped, we lost service on our phones but our GPS’ were working completely fine… So upon entering onto this road we were both very quiet and I was freaking out in my head because something felt wrong and off. I have to say here, I think what validates this experience even more for me is that fact my fiancé broke the silence and said “Does something feel off to you?” and I replied, “what do you mean?” he says “Like, does something feel weird?” I said \"yes.\" As were continuing to drive down this road it starts to feel like something is in the car with us… like something is in the back seat. Without me saying a word my fiancé looks in the back seat and says he see's nothing. I didn't dare even look in the rearview mirror, I had a feeling I wouldn't like what I saw. At this point in time I say in my head but not out loud, “I’m going to speed up to get off of this creepy road” but something in my head tells me not to do that. So I thought to myself again, “I’m going to slow down and pull over to gain my composure” and something in my head says “don’t do that either, just maintain what you’re doing.” Throughout all of this I am internally freaking out but on the outside I remained calm and collected, something inside of me told me to do that. Other things begin to happen, like the smell of sulfur in the car but when we rolled down the windows it was not outside, it was only in the car. I started to say things that didn’t FEEL like I was saying them like “oh… it’s coming from the vents… not outside” but as I said that it didn’t feel like I was saying it. I keep driving and out of the corner of my eye I swear I could see what looked like blood on the grass but when I looked directly at it, it was just grass. We begin to see road signs for towns we shouldn’t be passing by because they are no where near our home town or where we should be heading to get home. And this is where I really start to freak out. As we’re trying to figure out why the GPS is taking us this direction there is another dead deer in the middle of the road. I tried to swerve again but still hit some pieces of it. This whole time the heavy feeling of something being in the car is still there. After the 2nd deer I began to pray to anything that would listen in my head asking them to get me off of this “ride” because that’s what it felt like. A few moments after that I saw an exit far down the road, maybe a couple miles ahead. Mind you, throughout this whole entire drive, there were no exits or on ramps on this stretch of road whatsoever. There were no other cars on our side of the road, but sometimes we would see cars on the opposite side. We would later come to find out when we got home, that side of the road was under construction &amp; no cars should have been there. (On the route we were \"supposed\" to have been on but we weren't.. if that makes sense) This is the first exit we've seen this entire time that's felt like it's gone on for over an hour. As we were approaching this exit there is yet another dead deer in the middle of the road, my fiancé claims this one looked like it was skinned, like it was missing all of it’s skin, I can’t attest to this because I was not paying attention that hard to it, I was yet again trying not to hit the deer. As were passing the deer, there is a pull off in the median area of the highway where a cop car is sitting exactly parallel with the exit. The cop car had all 4 doors open, except no one was in the car and there were no lights on inside the car. The cop car looked like it was from a different time. It looked old, and was mostly brown, like a car from the 80s or 90s. I had this feeling telling me that if I went past that cop car and pass this exit, something really bad was going to happen. So I exit the highway, we pull off at this gas station that was directly off of the highway. We calm down, use the rest room, and set out yet again to go home. The gas station also felt really weird and just gave me creepy vibes. It looked like it was out of a different time period. Cigarettes were available for customers to pick up and take to the counter and buy, not behind the counter like they are now. As I’m listening to the GPS again, it tells me to make a right out of the gas station, which doesn’t make any sense because the way I needed to go was left, and there was nothing blocking my way from turning left. So I stupidly listen to the GPS again, and it takes me in a giant circle back behind the gas station in some weird neighborhood that also felt creepy, and then it makes me turn left onto the road we should have been on from the very start of our journey when we exited the first major highway. As I’m driving away from the gas station the feeling of the heaviness that something was in the car, just left. It went away. And I looked in the rearview mirror and nothing was there. I began to speed the whole entire way home because we had an hour left on our trip which also didn’t make any sense because we should have been home at 1am that night, and upon exiting that creepy highway, we had lost an hour. And by the time we arrived home it was an hour late, which also didn’t make any sense because the speed I was going to whole last hour home should have made up for any time we were “slowed down” but we still lost an hour on this time warp or twilight zone trip. We lost an hour and were on a road that doesn’t exist on any map. \n\nIn case you didn't know Google maps tracks the route you're going while using it. We both used our phones on this trip just to be safe, and my fiancé's phone says we took the \"correct\" route. The exit off to the right that curved instead of the \"straight\" one we took. My phone shows us traveling on roads that literally don't exist and in the towns we saw signs for.  \n\nAnother thing I’d like to add, we made the drive again 2 months later for Christmas to see his grandparents again and the whole ride home looked NOTHING like what we had experienced 2 months prior. Houses were there that weren't there before. Street signs were different, all of it. \n\nI can add more to this as proof something weird goes on with us every year in October. A year before this event happened, we were staying at his father's house watching it for them while he was out of town. We ordered a pizza for delivery and turned a movie on. About an hour later were like \"where is the pizza?\" And we call the pizza place and they said \"you guys just ordered it 20 minutes ago, the guy should be showing up any minute\" and we look at our phones, an hour had passed. We look at the clocks in the house, only 20 minutes had passed. But the movie we were watching was an hour in. Our phones never went back to normal after that, they were always an hour ahead no matter what we did until we switched to new phones. \n\nSo... Twilight zone? A demon after us? No idea. Would love your opinion though!",

        "text": "Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nI have a history of sleep paralysis, but it always happens when I’m on my back. It’s usually pretty quiet/serene. I sometimes would see an abstract human-like figure who was ghost-white with long black hair and appeared to be female. It used to creep me out, but I’ve learned to just keep my eyes closed and fall back asleep. It was a huge comfort once I got a little older and realized that there was actually nothing threatening about these episodes and that it was basically just a harmless hallucination. I learned to recognize my sleep paralysis and cope with it, so it was no longer a stressor for me. \n\nNow fast forward. I was in college at this point living at home with my parents and two of my brothers. I had fallen asleep in the “family room”, which was an extra open space we used as a play room growing up. My parent’s house was built in the 70’s, and at one point an addition to the house was added by previous owners. That’s where our family room is (along with an additional bedroom in the back corner and the laundry room). I had fallen asleep on the couch back there. It faced the entrance of the family room, and from here you could see the kitchen and part of the living room. I was having a perfectly normal dream when suddenly the dream was abruptly changed. Metaphorically, it felt like I had been casually watching cartoons when a broadcast alert interrupted the program to bring the viewers terrible news. \n\nI don’t remember much about the dream, just a few detail:\n\n1) It was Christmas. The lights were off but the Christmas tree illuminated things enough to see. \n2) It was a different house, yet the view from my sleeping position could overlay the view of the dream perfectly if that makes sense. Like the layout of the dream was built upon what my sleeping eyes were looking at in real life. \n3) There was a very unhappy/angry little boy. He was very small for his age and skinny. His head was too large for his body and he was wearing a helmet. I got the impression that maybe he was sickly and was wearing the helmet for medical reasons. \n\nThen in real life, I was awakened by the entire house shaking. I don’t live in a place that has earthquakes, so this immediately freaked me out. It was insanely loud. I could hear the windows rattling and could feel everything rumbling around me. I was unable to move. The room was dark, but I think there was a weird green glow. I kept hoping someone would come get me and save me. Now this part might sound a little insane and dumb, but please bear with me. The fear I felt was very real at seeing something like this that I couldn’t explain. There was some kind of “monster” right in front of me. It looked like a tangle of limbs and had no face. I felt like it wanted to hurt me, and I was extremely threatened by it. I remember thinking like, “Is this actually happening? How am I going to explain this to anybody?” I was completely panicked at this point but still couldn’t move. It’s the worst fear I’ve ever felt in my life.\n\nI don’t remember what happened after that, just that at some point I was able to “break free” and I ran to the bedroom that was back here with me. My dad was sleeping in there and he was the closest person in the house. I woke him up bawling like a baby and trying to explain what just happened. I think my family thought I was having a mental breakdown when we all went over it again the next day haha….\n\nI have no real explanation for that night. Like I said before, I know my body and I know my sleep paralysis episodes. This felt like something different. I was on my stomach when it happened, not my back. I also distinctly felt like a foreign presence had entered the room that night and terrorized me. This wasn’t just my own brain this time, this was something else entirely. It’s never happened again since, but my family and friends all agreed that this addition of the house never feels quite “right” especially at night. I decided never to sleep back there again and have been fine ever since. Whenever we have guests, they always feel anxious sleeping back there and some have reported having unusual/disturbing dreams when sleeping back there. \n\nI’m not usually quick to believe paranormal explanations for stuff, but there is a small detail that is likely unrelated but I thought would be interesting. A few years later once all the kids moved out, my mom started remodeling the house. They knocked a wall down and inside was a mummified kitten alongside a vintage black and white photo of a girl. It freaked the contractor out and they decided to throw it away but my brother sent me a picture of it before doing so. I’m not sure the best way to share it since I can’t post it on this sub, so I’ll post in on my profile. It’s the front and back of the photo. (Also I don’t have the photo of the poor kitten for obvious reasons, and even if I did I wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing it. I love animals and especially cats, so I was very saddened when I heard about it being found that way. I can only hope it had a natural and peaceful passing and that it wasn’t abused in any way.)\n\nI still get teary eyed when remembering this incident due to how confusing and scary it was for me and also just how sudden and unexpected it was. \n\nTLDR: “Sleep paralysis” where the house was shaking loudly, few years later found a mummified kitten with a vintage photo in the wall while renovating",

        "text": "  \n\nWhile investigating locations of alleged hauntings or paranormal activity, an investigator needs to determine, if this is a legitimate claim or not. Before we investigate any location, we do a search for any history, if needed, I mean if a home was built within the past 30 years. We do not consider a deep historical work up would be needed. \n\nSecondly, we interview the individual who contacted us, to get more insight into what they experience. We do not ask for hot spots, as that my cause a predisposition of activity happening, rather. We prefer to do a cold investigation, my wife is a sensitive, and as such she is not present during any interview. \n\nFrom our interview, we can determine, if the location could be experiencing paranormal activity. We are very careful to not state a location as haunted at the beginning of our investigation or following until we review any data collected. \n\nI believe there are two important things any investigator needs to practice. The first is to not be so intense to find any activity to the point that any small noise, or any recorded garble becomes evidence. The need to understand that while running vid’s they can and do cause some distortion while recording, depending on the light available, if not using IR, FLIR, or UV light. These distortions could lead to false positives or pareidolia. Rather than actual evidence. \n\nThe second thing, is to be methodical in your investigation, running around in the dark supposedly chasing sounds or what may be considered an apparition, looks more like a slap stick comedy scene. Take one room at a time, moving from one end to the other. Run vids and still photos. You should not attempt to interpret data during investigating, rather, during review away from the location. \n\nMost of this should seem like common sense, however, I have on many occasions found this not to be the case. I am not trying to detract from other investigators, I am sharing what I have seen, and continue to see in my over thirty years of chasing the ghosts. I hope my insight may help people who are looking to do the same.",

I was standing by the sink against one wall, and there was a figure against the far wall wearing matching wide brim hat, shirt, gloves, pants, dress shoes, and trench coat. It all looked like it was made of old, heavily weathered tan leather. Like almost caramel colored tan. I don’t remember him saying anything to me, we just stared at each other for a bit but I couldn’t actually make out any definitive facial features because his face was constantly changing. After staring at each other for what felt like forever, he pulled out a cane, started walking towards me, and right as he started reaching out towards me I shot up in bed. I hadn’t even fallen asleep, that started the instant I closed my eyes. Then the time I saw him on the side of the road was about a year later. \n\n\nJust really curious if anyone else has any kind of similar experience.",

        "text": "I’m posting this here because I’m not sure where else to, so I hope it fits. I just need to share this. So almost a week ago, one of my favourite teachers from high school (I literally only had 2 that I absolutely adored) tragically passed away after a long and painful battle with cancer. It came as a shock to most of us, at least to me because even though I knew he was sick, I really had strong hope and faith in my heart that he would manage to recover. Unfortunately, that was not the case. So most of my former classmates and I kinda got back together because of this tragedy and we paid our respects the best we could to his family. I was very involved in the whole thing as like I mentioned, I truly loved him as a teacher and he had a big impact on my life in a positive way growing up. Despite this, I had decided I would not attend the funeral or anything as I wanted to remember him the way I knew and loved him and felt like going would only make it harder and more depressing for me. Now, the funeral was on Wednesday and last night (Thursday night) I had the following dream. Everything was mostly normal, I was in my former high school as we had what seemed like a small reunion with some of my former classmates and we even met with another one of our teachers. We discussed our teacher’s passing a little bit too and there was just a heaviness over all of us because of it. Then, as I was leaving the school, walking through the hallways I passed by a classroom which had the door mostly open and as I looked, I froze. In there at the front desk, I saw the teacher who had passed away, except he was very old. I forgot to mention he was in his 40s when he passed away, so it was an early passing, which made it all the more tragic. The strange thing about it was that it seemed very realistic, like it wasn’t just the way I knew he looked but older, he had also gained a lot of weight and his hair was white and different. (I hope that makes sense, what I’m trying to say is you know how when you think of someone you’re familiar with, it’s hard to imagine what they would look like older and the best our minds can usually come up with is the person as we know them just with a few more wrinkles maybe and grey hair, but most details stay the same.) So it was very specific. I would say he looked close to retirement. I entered the classroom, the kids were also there at their desks; basically it was in the middle of a lesson. I walked towards my teacher and simply started bawling uncontrollably, I couldn’t even get a word out. My teacher, as kind as I knew him put his hands on my shoulders and was smiling at me warmly. He was telling the kids that I must be very emotional because we hadn’t seen each other in a very long time. But when I looked at him I for some reason could tell that he knew exactly why I was crying, like he knew he was dead in my reality. He had this very reassuring look about him and was giving me very positive vibes by just looking at me. Then I woke up and immediately started bawling my eyes out just like I was in the dream. To me, this was very special as I’m sure it was his spirit trying to connect with me to give me a sort of confirmation that his soul lives on and that he knew I cared about him very much. I’m not religious, but I do believe in a sort of afterlife which involves reincarnation. I also am a strong believer in parallel universes, so I also think me walking into that classroom was a peek into another version of reality where he hadn’t passed away and went on to live a full life doing what he was so clearly passionate about, which was teaching. Very comforting experience and it really helped me come to terms with his passing and getting some closure.",

He's gone to dinners with Me and my current partner and they got along amazingly.

The day of his death this random garage light started coming on. There is no switch to it, we've never seen it on and don't even know how to access it. It's not even on our fuse box. \n\nIt came on every night the first month he passed. The consistency has grown less but it still comes on spontaneously. Day/night it doesn't matter. \n\nThere's been other stuff too like things falling in the middle of us having dinner and it's across the room. The backdoor which is annoying to open has been opening easily with no one around and it was shut tight. Then the dreams I've been having. \n\nWhat do I use to see if it is him? A spirit box? I am so new to this as I myself have been dismissing all the weird signs growing up. \n\nBackstory on me: \nI luckily have not had a lot of death around me growing up. But what scared me always was when I did have to go to funerals for a distant relative I didn't know. I always had these freaky ass dreams. Always the same location, same feeling and theme. But it would be whoever died talking to me in the room. When I became a CNA I had I horrible dreams of a man following me home and getting closer to me in each dream until he finally touched me in the dream. He went away and I haven't dreamt of him since except for one final time when it was him but it was a weird scary ass monster. \n\nAfter that I always without fail get dreams from the dead and its always some type of 'goodbye'.. I since had my palm read and they told me something evil is latched to me. I had my Tarot read and same thing, something bad is over me. 🙃  I thought this was just my wild imagination until someone told me to write down all the things that seemed 'off' or my dreams I could remember since childhood. .....now it doesn't seem like a fucking coincidence. I'm intrigued and a bit unnerved. \n\nAny advice on any of this 3am fever rant would be incredible",

He started showing up when I was around 13 but I don’t have much memory of this time in my life so I asked my dad if I ever mentioned it to him. He said that he doesn’t remember that but that when I was little I would tell him about “the red eye guy” in my room. He changed the subject after that so I don’t know how old he’s considering little, but I’m hoping he’s talking about the same time period. Bc if he means when I was really little then that’s just really creepy.",

        "text": "I don't really believe in the paranormal all that much. Though a few nights ago I was on a beach at night with two friends. Every year when it gets cold we all go to the beach and drink a couple of beers around a fire in the cold. We started to star gaze, I had an app that tracks satellites and we were hoping we were able to see anything that night. I was waiting for the ISS but it was not visible yet. my friend pointed out something in the sky asking what that was. I saw what he was looking at. It was a yellowish light moving at first in a straight path. I didn't see anything on my app (sky guide for reference). I thought it could be a meteor. Though it was moving slowly and from what I know they only appear for a few seconds. We were watching it for some time when it out of nowhere made a 90-degree turn and then disappeared.   A few minutes later we spotted two of them moving and constantly switching directions. I tried to record but couldn't get a good video. My honest opinion was we were watching a meteor shower. \n\nThe strange part about all this is we took two cars and both our car's batteries were dead when we were leaving. This is somewhat of a common occurrence for my car but if a few tries it eventually turns on. It still wasn't turning on though. I tried to call someone that might be able to come to jump our cars but I had no service neither did my friends. We took some time to calm down and made sure no one came around and did something to our cars. But we were parked from anything and we would know if anyone was around.  My friend pointed out the yellow light again it was getting brighter then started to fade to nothing. I tried to start my car again it worked so did my friend's. Our service was not back on till we left the beach area.\n\nFor the context none of us got drunk or we did not smoke weed. I'm still confused about what I saw I wasn't puzzled until our cars and service weren't working. My friend said he had a strange dream where strange men were asking him personal questions but that's probably unrelated. I also had a strange eerie feeling something was off that night too. Also to add when we were leaving on the ride home we saw someone walking on the road leading to where we were with a tank top and shorts on in 30-degree weather. The road was a mile away from any civilization. The area does have a lot of strange people so that's not super uncommon to see.",

        "text": "So, a while back I mentioned some dreams I've been having where in the dreams, I'd wake up in my bed with the bedroom, everything being exactly the same as it is in real life. The dreams were terrifying. Also, when I was pregnant, I was seeing things around the house- mainly black figures- and I have heard children are more sensitive to these types of things. I think maybe I was able to see these things because my child was inside of my body. \nWell, I was reading a post just now and a comment mentioned keeping \"black obsidian\" near his daughter, or in a necklace, as he felt his daughter was being haunted. This made me think of one of my dreams that meant nothing to me at the time. \n\nSo right after I had a dream of something running at full speed through my apartment into my bedroom, I had another dream that I woke up in bed. In this one, my fiance woke up and gave me this black rock. I was laying on my side and he put it like where the \"little spoon\" would be if I was cuddling someone..like in the bend of my stomach, If that makes sense. I asked him what it was and he said \"its obsidian. It will keep you safe.\" \n\nNow, I've never heard of any of these things that are supposed to help you in these situations. When we got up for the day, I told my fiancé about the dream and he was like, \"umm okay? I gave you a rock in your dream?\" So I dismissed it as nothing and moved on with my day.\n\nNow that I saw that post, I'm wondering if the dream was trying to tell me something. I think it's strange because I would have never known what this rock is, but when I saw that comment on a post, it made me think that if its supposed to protect you, maybe I should get it?",

        "text": "No one in person believes me. Usually it’s a dream where I’m visited by someone or a pet, and they’re saying goodbye. I wake up already crying, and they have all died in the night no matter how physically far. The longest away was the other coast. \n\nOr I’ll be driving, typing, something and it’s like a little voice saying they’re going to die. They all have. Dad was the strongest, but a teacher I loved and another cat, too. Last year, I stood on a trunk listening to This Year by the Mountain Goats and said my beloved cat would die. She did that May of an aneurysm. \n\nAnd the lowest stakes version is pet related and I get the urge to record them. And I never see them again alive. \n\nAnd I have personally had two near deaths including a coma early this year where I saw my beloved cat and my late father. I still have long COVID and almost died three weeks ago as well (anaphylaxis from bad edibles, this would’ve been a humiliating way to go). I saw the afterlife with dad. The cat stayed with me as she always did when I was sick in person. It actually caused me to feel peace. They are still in existence somewhere. I won’t be alone. But only when it’s time. I want to live to see my daughter get old. I said we’d be like the Golden Girls. She didn’t get it, but she’s six haha. \n\nMy father’s funeral lilies bloomed exactly once, and it was the day my daughter was born, 2013-2022 the lilies are alive. I hear our song every time there’s a big deal event going on even if I don’t know it’s a big deal yet. \n\nI want to understand in the context of almost losing my own life (the second one was actually embarrassing lol), because it feels like the line between me and whatever else exists is thinner. I don’t believe I’m in danger, not from any of this anyway. Maybe COVID and pineapple juice hiding the taste of cheap THC. But not any of this. \n\nNote that I’m not feeling urgency so much as curiosity. Our cops are openly saying they’re not coming out for non-violent offenses anyway. And they don’t say this part, but they’re not coming out for DV either. So even if I was scared, local authorities don’t give a shit. Animosity between our cops and us is long standing. But again, I feel that these are goodbyes more than anything. \n\nJust why?",

        "text": " While this hasn't necessarily been a long-time traumatic memory for me, I still felt it was worth mentioning because I find myself reflecting on this memory with little to no explanation as to what could have been going on. Chock it up to childhood fears maybe, but I had several encounters as a young child with what I now think may have been a shadow person. The encounters started randomly, I can't pinpoint a date, partially because there was no discernable date, and partially because of how young I was at the time. Regardless, the encounters would go as follows for the better part of 2 years: I'd wake up in the middle of the night, maybe 7 years old at the time. I'd wander outside my room, unable to sleep. I'd look around the vast darkness of my hallway, and every time, I would land on a distinct silhouette of a man, seemingly wearing a trench coat. The image of the man was blurry, but I could tell that he had a humanoid physiology and appearance. As I would become startled, I would begin backing away to retreat to my parents' bedroom. The figure/man would begin advancing toward me, in wide steps. Every time I would become petrified by the figure, and end up spending the night in my parents' bedroom. The figure seemed to disappear at my parents' doorway to their bedroom every time, but it is possible I simply looked away too fast since I was now in the 'safety' of my parents' bed, and didn't want to continue looking at the terrifying figure. The encounters stopped when I was about 10, and haven't occurred since. The figure was the *exact* same every single time, like the silhouette of a man in the corner of my hallway.",

When she came back the girl was gone.\n\nWith that being said apparently my aunt used to cry a lot when she was little, showing things that wasn’t there.

My mom is gifted so was her mom and her mom, you get it, it runs in my family. I’ve had experiences for as long as I can remember.\n\nMy daughter is 5. She likes for me to lie down with her in her bed until she falls asleep.\n\n3 nights ago, I fall asleep in her bed. I woke up 2 hours later. On her side of the bed, kind of hovering a bit, I see a dear loved one, my baby cousin, that passed away 4 years ago, smiling up at me and standing / floating like she just started getting up from hugging my little one. She speaks to me telepathically, telling me the same words of love she would say in life, the same way she would lovingly tease me. She is emanating light and love; the light is almost blinding. She also has Angel wings, huge white feathered wings. This surprised me and I look around.\n\nAround the bed I feel more beings / Angel? gather round. The bed is surrounded, including my side of the bed. I can’t make out the details, just the forms of beings with huge wings emanating blinding light. I look over again on my little one’s side and my cousin smiles sweetly, tells me telepathically “it’s ok “the pet name she called me”” and kind of fades away. The other angels lights gets blinding and poof, they’re all gone. This was the first time since her passing I’ve seen / felt that relative. I have other relatives (mostly grandparents) I see regularly and communicate with.\n\nI wasn’t sleeping but was not quite awake either. I was softly crying when it was over. \n\nI spoke to my mom yesterday. My cousin was her godchild. The same night I did, my mom had the same experience too; saw our relative. She called hers a dream and said it meant we don’t pray enough. I don’t believe that’s what it is but I’m confused on what the message was all about. \n\nI miss this cousin so much but I’m happy I got to see her. She died as a teen and looked like she did before getting sick. \n\nThank you if you read this far. Any comment is appreciated 🙏❤️",

I don’t remember falling asleep but all of a sudden i ‘woke up’ and checked the clock, which stated about 2:50pm. I then looked to the right of my bed and saw my boyfriend standing over the bed. I knew it couldn’t be him since he travels to work early in the morning and wasn’t off that day. Another reason i knew it couldn’t be him was his face seemed off, he had an almost photoshopped blur over his face (similar to how google censors people in its maps) and all I could see was two darkened blurry indents where his eyes should of been. For some reason through my fear I screamed at him to hold my hand. Which at first he refused, and then did so. I then woke up to an empty house and the clock displaying 12:30pm. \n\nSide note: since this I’ve experienced footsteps around my home and people calling my name in a mimick tone of my loved ones. I also have noticed darting figures in the corners of my eyes and at the end of my bed at night.",

After sitting and beginning to eat breakfast, my roomate walks back toward the other side of the room and before crossing infront of the table he notices ANOTHER puddle has formed in the area he had just walked through. \n\nPlease if anyone has had this happen before  feel free to help me out",

He would even throw trash out himself in the kitchen trash can but a few days from there he’s been acting weird. He refuses to go throw anything away alone. Says he’s “scared” and he always points to the upstairs stairs, saying “there” it’s concerning because he will be playing and watching tv and immediately when you leave he starts crying and running in your direction as if something scared him. \n\nMind you, before all this me and my mom would hear strange noises and doors closing but we gave it the benefit of the doubt and ignore it. I’m not scared easily but I’ve been this past few days. \n\nOn one occasion, I was downstairs and my nephew usually sleeps till 10-11am and I know he comes right down the stairs when he wakes up. This time I heard some noise so I decided to mute the tv. After that upstairs bathroom flushed, a door to a walk in closet closed, and I heard small footsteps running towards my moms room. Immediately after that my nephew starts coming down the stairs. I was confused because I thought HE was the one who ran towards the room. Idk if it’s an imaginary friend but if it is it’s not nice at all towards my nephew. Could it be something bad? Or my house is just old?",

As it's winter it gets dark pretty early so it was dark except for the streetlights.\n\nAt the end of our run, we were walking back through the park area when across a small grassy area (on a path going parallel to us) we noticed some kind of floating orb-like shiny looking thing. The two paths are maybe about 60ft apart, and this object was floating but still travelling forward.\n\nI think we noticed this together and stood looking at it for a few seconds. I was trying to figure out what the hell it could be when all of a sudden my friend starts whistling and calling it over (he later explained that he thought it might have been a little dog hence the whistling). At this point, it stopped travelling for a few seconds, changed direction and started making it's way towards us across the grass!! As it was getting closer it was morphing into different shapes (that I can't really describe, just random shapes!)\n\nWe both looked at each other then and he said \"Is that what I think it is?\" (referring to a ghost I guess!) I said \"yeah\" and we both just turned and ran as fast as we ever have away from it without looking back!!\n\nAfter we got some distance away we calmed down and just couldn't explain what had happened! We discussed it and we both seen the exact same thing! Right now, we regret not actually staying to see what would have happened, but at that moment I guess our primal instincts just kicked in and we legged it!\n\nIf I was by myself, I would have 100% chalked it up to my imagination, but since we both seen the exact same thing, we are very confused! It might also be worth pointing out that the park is right beside an old graveyard, and that is where the \"entity\" was heading before my friend called it over!\n\nAny ideas ?",

The first time was when I was 14. I was staying with my grandma and I was in my bed asleep. In the dream something rips off my blanket and pulls me out of bed. They make me walk head down across the hall to my grandmas bed and kneel at it. I have my face buried in her bed and something is breathing in my ear when suddenly the pressure is gone and I’m told go back to sleep. I woke up and thought it was a nightmare but my blankets were on the other side of the room and all the doors were open. My grandma was strict about keeping doors closed for fire safety so I doubt she would have opened them. Twice over the years I’ve dreamed of a male, but I never see his face. And whenever I touch him I wake up. I had another dream at a friends house where I encountered the same thing from my child hood. I was on my stomach and it was sitting on me breathing in my ear again when the weight is lifted and I’m told “go back to sleep.” When I woke up the door is open again, and I’m buried under pillows and blankets on her bed. Can anyone help me with some possible ideas?",

I’ve been doing weird candle shit with old clay sculptures with faces in it that my deceased g-pa found when he travelled to dig cites in Mexico. I’m about to faint with fear. Terrified of what might pop up in the darkness. I’ve been doing other weird shit to be “weird and cool” just for kicks. I keep seeing patterns. And I keep seeing these two parallel white lights. Whether they’re holes in wall or adjacent lights. At first I acknowledged the patterns cuz I naturally do stuff like that as an artist. Now it’s like they’re big eyeballs that watch me. Now it’s getting real and scary. Incredibly more paranoid. And yeah, I know that I shouldn’t have messed with those artifacts, even from a secular point of view it’s disrespectful. What are some quick fixes for the moment? I’m too afraid to leave my room. And the worst part is, I don’t believe in Jesus!!

I couldn't make out too much of what I saw but it wasn't human, and it was completely white, it looked as if it walked next to the Christmas tree straight into a wall, I didn't see it walk into the wall because I saw it at the corner of my eye for only two seconds but I know there is a wall there and I saw it walk past the Christmas tree.

        "text": "I only shared this experience with my husband and I just need to talk about it more. So I hope that I can share this story with you all and get some feedback on what you think had happened and how I should proceed. \n\nThis is not the first time I saw dead relatives in my dream. I saw him a few times since he passed and saw my grandma once (great story for another time). \n\nI think I could just be dreaming of him from the lack of closure and the unresolved feelings I still carry with me. Nonetheless, let's begin.\n\nMy mom came to the US during the recession. Things were bad for her and her family. She was working multiple jobs when she met him. He fell in love with her pretty quick and proposed to her, telling her he'd help getting her children here. My mom said yes. She loved him. Not mainly from who he is, but mainly from how he made her feel: comfortable and safe. I don't blame her. She was living in a small efficiency and eating 2 meals a day when they met. But you know, it's not really the real love everyone is searching for.\n\nI moved to the US with my sibling a few years later, and I just loved him. I mean he wasn't perfect. But for a stranger to be so kind and do so much for you, I just couldn't believe it. I love my biological father and have a good relationship with him, but this guy was my daddy. He taught me so much about life in America. \n\nI did mention that this wasn't a love marriage to my mom. So you can guess it, they got divorced after 6 years of marriage. They still kept their friendship, and my sibling and I were still his children. One day he told my mom he got cancer and that he was gonna die. But it was one of those cancer with very low mortality rate. So I thought my mom was exaggerating. I didn't think anything of it. \n\nI kept in touch with him from time to time. One day I got a call from him when I was occupied. So I didn't pick up. I forgot and called back 3 days later, but the call wasn't answered. I thought he'd call back. I sent him a couple of texts but didn't hear back. Well, months go by and he didn't call. I forgot that I was even waiting. \n\nA few months later, while vacationing with my husband (boyfriend at the time), our flight back home got delayed. We were exhausted and had to find a hotel to stay at 2 am. I fell asleep very quickly. That night, I dreamt that he called me to say that he was doing fine and that I should stop worrying. I woke up at 6 am to catch my flight back. Not sure if I was just too tired at that moment, but I actually believed that the call really happened until after I took a shower. When I got back home, I tried calling him. After that night, I just felt like something was wrong. I called him every day, and texted him every night. I didn't get anything. My husband decided to google his name and found his obituary. I lost my shit. I got in contact with his son's wife and talked to her. The day I missed his called was the day he passed. Not sure if that was a call from his son to inform me or a call from him. Either way, I was crushed. I thought about the time I told him that when I make money, I was gonna buy him 20 eyeglasses for different places in the house since he always misplaced them. I didn't even get to do that. \n\nThere were a few times that I felt his presence since that day. One where I dreamt of just talking to him in the park near our old home. Another was when I found his old pictures a few weeks after my husband and I got married.\n\nThe most recent one was a few nights ago. This is the one that compelled me to share my story. \n\nMost of my dreams are just like any Family Guy episodes. A bunch of cutaway that makes no sense. But some are vivid, and this was one of them. I dreamt that I was in some sort of a spy project. I was standing on an outdoor balcony of a shopping mall, searching for a target across from me. The mall was busy like there was an event going on. Across from me was a different shopping mall, with a road between the one I was standing. That mall was really nice. Mostly old people but younger folks were present. It got this nice, retro looking movie theater with a putt putt golf lawn in the front. Everyone there seemed to enjoy themselves. \n\nFor some reason, I decided to change my target. I wanted to look for daddy. I don't know what I was expecting but I found him. He was standing there with a red shirt, holding a golf club, talking to another guy. They seem to be working on their swing. I got so excited, I started yelling and waving. He turned around and waved back at me. I picked up my phone and called him. When he picked up and said hello, I started wailing. I told him I missed him and that I wanted to see him. I asked if and how I can come to see him. Before I could get any answer, I woke up. My pillow was soaked from my tears. I tried to remember if he was trying to say anything on that call, but I don't think he said anything. \n\nAll the other times that I felt his presence, it felt like he was reaching out to me. This time, it's different. It was like I was reaching out to him. Do you think that's possible? I have been considering talking to a medium. Would that be a waste of my time/money?",

I would wake up and I would see a little girl out of the corner of my eye she was young and had gray skin had patchy hair and it looked like she had been crying as there was a black line going down from the corners of her eyes.\n\nAnyways it was like she was shy and really didn't like being looked at.\n\nEventually I moved out of my parents house and moved in with (now former girlfriend) and it didn't seem to like her at all. There was one morning she woke up in the middle of the night screaming and asked me to look at her back and she had three red lines going down her back. There was another time where GF was playing on my Xbox and all of a sudden her hair was grabbed and yanked back. \n\nMeanwhile, while I'm living away from home my family are experiencing something mimicking their voice. My mom heard my sister call her from upstairs and my sister heard my mom call her downstairs. (Neither did neither)\n\nAnd last night I heard it calling my name first it used my sister's voice then switched to my mom's voice, then strangely used my former girlfriend's voice.\n\nI'm afraid it's slowly getting stronger and I don't want to do one thing that only makes it mad and more strong,",

Upon entering there everything looked like in those days but a little foggy, as if a light mist surrounds everything.\n\nWhen I turned left just as I entered there were 2 black doors through which a colleague of mine came out wearing a \"president's security\" suit, I greeted him and asked him How was he answered calmly but when I shook his hand I realized that my right arm did not have several tattoos that I have (I recently got new tattoos) so in my dream it was It's weird not to see them so I looked back and my mom was there and I told her \"it's weird, my tattoos aren't there\" and she looked at me confused, then I looked at my partner and she had the same look.\n\nWhen I looked at my arm the tattoos on my fingers returned after concentrating a lot on remembering my tattoos and their position only now that fog became denser and I had tunnel visionWhen I turned back to my mom I told her that everything felt like a dream and that I really knew I was dreaming since I made my tattoos appear, when I raised my hand I already had all my tattoos But at that point everything started to feel weird like when you know you're somewhere you shouldn't be. It quickly occurred to me that I might be having a lucid dream which I was moved since I hadn't had one for a long time, but when I turned to my partner again he was standing in a firm position as if something had disturbed him and my mom was in the Same position which was weird because before they were acting naturally. The fog and the tunnel view intensified and I felt very heavy, so much so that I could not move my body, only my head And when asking what was happening my partner just said in the coldest way I've ever heard anyone speak \"WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE\".\n\nThat took me by surprise and I only managed to ask \"why?\" when I felt that they took me from behind (probably my mother) and I felt a very sharp pain in my stomach as if they were cutting my belly off I couldn't move and I couldn't do anything to run away, suddenly my partner jumped on me and began to shake my whole body as if trying to wake me up. What scared me the most was the expression on his face as if he was afraid that something or someone would see me since he was constantly looking around, During the struggle everything turned black and I felt great pressure in my chest and a chill that ran through my entire body, I took a deep breath and I woke up.....\n\nWhen I woke up I didn't feel anything strange, I was just confused because everything was very real as if I had really had a lucid dream, although my previous lucid dreams were of the \"I can fly\" type.Or being anywhere else never anything like today, I'm not a person who lucid dreams very often which this one took me by surprise.\n\nSorry if the story was a bit long, at first I said it would be short but I think it got a little out of hand. Thanks for taking the time to listen to my story and I only came to REDDIT because I did not want to forget what happened since it was something creepy",

I was 15 years old, it was late and I had to go to school the next day, but I kept turning around on bed.  I was always very afraid of the dark, but there was a time when my parents forced me to sleep with the lights off because I was too old for that (I know, but thank you mom and dad, now I'm even more afraid).  There is a popular belief that limbs should not be left out of bed, right?  in case someone grab them. Sheets are safe, right?  Well, at the time I didn't think of that.  I think it was 2 am, but I'm not sure.  I was in complete darkness, trying to fall asleep, when I feel a tug on my arm, close to my wrist.  Definitely as if someone had tried to push me off the bed with his hand.  I barely remember the touch, but it wasn't warm, it didn't feel normal.  Guys, I didn't scream because I thought my brain went into panic and shock, but I did instantly stand on the bed (yes) trying to peer in the dark, until my eyes got used to it.  There was nothing.  But if I had that damn feeling that i was being watched.  I got out of bed and almost blindly but quickly ran to turn on the light switch. Windows closed.  Door closed.  It gives me chills just saying this.  It is something that I rarely \"dare\" to even think about.  I refuse to enter a world  that scares me sm.  So... thanks, internet.  I leave it here, and never speak of it again. Sorry for my bad english. Thanks for the space. I do love horror stories and movies tho.",

I reluctantly got out of bed and made my way to the bathroom, my heart racing with fear.\n\nAs I reached the door, the screaming grew louder and more intense. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what I would find on the other side. But I knew I had to investigate. I slowly pushed the door open and peered inside.\n\nTo my surprise, the source of the noise was the drain in the shower. It was making a horrific, high-pitched shrieking sound. I stood there, frozen in shock, as the noise continued to fill the room. I didn't know what to do.\n\nAfter a few moments, the noise suddenly stopped. The silence was almost as unsettling as the screaming had been. I cautiously stepped into the bathroom, but there was no sign of anything out of the ordinary. The drain was just a normal drain, and the bathroom was empty.\n\nI still don't know what caused the drain to make that noise, but I never heard it again. To this day, the memory of that night still haunts me.",

However today I've got a set of experiences that have been happening recently to share and I'll now leave it to you guys to debunk and tell me what's going on since i got no idea what it is and why it is.\nRecently everyone's like majority of the hostellers have been facing issues sleeping at night, with many complaining about a weird feeling that someone is watching them or trying to drag em outta their beds. It even happened to the one guy who's my roommate and just today as i woke up and found him in a uncomfortable state of mind. When asked what's happening he told me that the entire night he was feeling a ghastly presence around him and always was having an sensation that someone is pulling his blanket off him the whole night. Strange thing is that i didn't had any of this but that's elementary i suppose.\nBut that's not all that there's to it. I was walking through the corridor one night this week for taking an piss, since the entire hallway was deserted and there was nothing to look at i was naturally taking the view of rhe balcony when guess what, i spotted like a whitish aperture appearing on the other side of the balcony, right staring at me, although it didn't had any characteristics to distinguish about but i felt like it. It didn't took me long before i made up my mind to rush towards the thing (took me a bit of guts, wouldn't lie) but when i reached there.....yes you guys guessed it. There was no one .\nThe next morning i told my friends about this encounter and then to my surprise they told me that the only reason behind why no one dares to be out at night is because almost everyone has once spotted that \"thing\" exactly where i encountered. I'll be honest it actually creeped me out a bit but then i instantly dismissed it. Will continue this thread when something more happens which now I'm convinced will continue to happen but in the meantime folks help me know whatever is this.\n\nNOTE:- It's actually a bit warmer in the place rn but at the exact spot where that supposed aperture i talked about was spotted, that place had it's floor and walls and everything like ice cold. Idk why",

This is the only paranormal experience I’ve had that I’ve remembered so vividly. To summarise, I saw him while sleeping in my mums room early in the morning, he gave me the evilest look and I was very scared and he kissed my mum on the forehead. That’s the important details. (It was DEFINITELY my dad, not an evil entity) \n\nSo basically, I think abt it every now and then and tonight I brought it up to my mum and we both talked about the experience. Tonight I found out that mum was having dreams about him around this time and I said to her “I’ve never seen him again, I wonder why”. She goes on to tell me that the last ever dream she had of him was her asking if she will see him again, he said no this was the last time. And that was it. We have never heard from him again. \n\nI’ve been crying over this for a while now. Because it makes me so sad that he never said goodbye to me, my mum got all these dreams from him and I got a scary encounter that has traumatised me for the rest of my life. I don’t know why he gave me that mean look and my mum got a forehead kiss. Also to note that my dad was married to another woman before he passed so I don’t get the forehead kiss. Maybe it was the proper last goodbye. Everything confuses me about this and I’m sad I never got to properly say goodbye to him. I hope he visits me in my dreams like he did with my mum and says a proper goodbye so I can be at peace with myself and my strained relationship with him.\n another update‼️ (I wrote this text yesterday but copy and pasted it here) \nI spoke out loud, trying to contact him, saying that I miss and love him and would appreciate if he gave me a sign and could appear in my dreams and give a proper goodbye. I said that if he didn’t, he doesn’t love me orrr he just isn’t receiving the message. I woke that morning, nothing. I had a restless nights sleep but no signs from him. Why is he ignoring me? I know he can hear me. I know he can see how much sadness this situation brings me. I played his favourite song a couple times a day too and nothing. Sometimes I feel his presence, but he never gives me anything more. If he isn’t gonna give me any signs, why can’t he just say goodbye to me and give me one last message?",

I've definitely experienced things here and there since I'se a kid that I'm confident can't be explained by science or illusion, but only as something other worldly interfering. Though nothing I've experience has ever been disturbing to me, but it gives me a lot to think about. This being the most personal and long lasting experience, in **May of 2014.**\n\nJust as some background context; I live in central Florida, United States. Since it being a very touristy state, of course towns and other areas like to try and brush over the dark history and even erase it by building overtop of it or trying to rewrite the history around it to be harmless. In reality, Florida is the most Southern state you can get. The Klan, Manifest Destiny, Civil War battles &amp; skirmishes, Native American tribe displacement &amp; eradication, we had it all. Some of the popular tourist attractions around me, if you ask the right people, will tell you the truth of the atrocities that happened there. So yes, it's entirely likely that the majority of this state has *some sort of activity* or another.\n\nI was in 7th grade at the time, and throughout the year, I had heard about my friend Bryce who lived out on the beach in a four story house, he had the entire attic/top floor to himself. The beach would be  another 250 years out from his house, and next to his house was an empty lot, followed by an old graveyard, then apartments/housing. The headstones mostly faced towards the beach, but it's entrance was towards the street behind it. I beleive this graveyard was one of two things, but I can't remember for sure. 1. Formerly a slave graveyard from Civil War times that turned into a segregated graveyard up until the 1900s (1900-1909). 2. A Native American graveyard from the displacement projects or wars that happened in the 1810s - 1850s. I personally lean towards the ladder, though I have never been able to find out more about this graveyard.\n\nBryce had told me about one night he couldn't sleep or something, and he looked out his window into the pitch black night to see a set of blue-glowing eyes glowing, looking at him (no pupil visible). I don't know what time of night this was. This had likely happened because the graveyard was in the process of being built over. Laying foundations, but just removing the headstones for most of it. Bryce was a bit naive, but I never got the impression from him that he'd lie about something like this. I was intrigued and wanted to see this for myself. I finally got my chance on May 14th, 2014 on the last day of true, non-exam filled school, when we went on a fieldtrip to a local theme park, and ended the day having a party on the beach at Bryce's house. During this party, I had made sure to get him to take me over to it from the beach side. He left me for a while. I looked at it and took out my \"for emergencies hand-me-down\" phone (2010 Samsung T669 Gravity T), and took some pictures as I had seen others do online. I truly regret to this day just trespassing onto it, and taking a look at these gravestones remaining, but my 13 year old self didn't think that no one could care. During this time, some people had walked by on the neighborhood street a long way away, but I'm absolutely sure that no one was there by the time I took pictures.\n\nI didn't see anything at the time, and went about the party. But when I got back home and I looked over the pictures, I had found one of the three I took had two people, clear as day, standing near the front gates. From the lower quality images, I could only vaguely make out they looked like Indians. Straight from the Seminole tribe, which was the main tribe fought in Florida during those years previously said. I always planned on getting those pictures moved to a different phone over the last 8 years, but never did it until a few weeks ago back in November. I remember that I deleted a third picture back in 2016, seeing nothing, and thinking that the other pictures showed what I saw. But it appears that I was wrong. So now you have just the two taken. The time was about 5:00 IIRC.\n\nI haven't been able to find anything else about this graveyard since, other than that Bryce told me in the fall of 2014 that the place had been entirely obliterated by gentrification, leaving a ugly apartment building on top of it, which he was adamant was haunted. I lost contact with him in 2015, so that's a dead end too. I'm not sure how one could disprove this, apart from call this story fake which I can't blame you for, but it is my truth. Maybe this will help someone.",
