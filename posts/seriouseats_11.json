        "text": "TL;DR, what are the best applications to highlight a robustly beefy, delicious home-made beef stock (besides French onion soup)?\n\nSo I know Kenji and and Daniel frequently suggest using chicken stock, as it's much easier to make, more dependable to buy, and much more flexible, and I *generally* follow this prescription. However, there is one dish for which my partner will accept no substitutes: about once a year, when the weather first turns chilly, she demands my best French onion soup. So, throughout the year I dutifully save the bones and trimmings from any prime ribs, oxtails, short ribs, marrow bones etc., bag and date them, and store them in the deep freezer for French Onion Soup Day. Since I've got a year to gather only the best \"scraps,\" plenty of advance warning to dedicate a weekend to the project, and a pressure cooker, the resulting stock is *good*. Sets up like Jell-O, tastes like the seared crust of a prime rib. \n\nOnly problem is, that French onion soup craving is weirdly like a once annual thing. Now I've got about  3 liters of liquid beef ambrosia taking up space in my freezer and no great ideas for what to do with it. It's way too beefy to substitute for chicken stock, it definitely tastes like an 80/20 smashburger punched you in the mouth. I'm sure I'll make a stew and/or chili, but 1) that won't account for all of it, 2) that's what I do every year and my partner just revealed to me that she *doesn't like beef stew*. (Something about the potatoes I think, she really doesn't like the texture of boiled potatoes, so stew ideas more interesting than the traditional Irish stew are more than welcome).\n\nSo redditors of seriouseats, whatcha got to highlight great beef stock?",

        "text": "Hey all! So I’ve been giving the task of making a baked mac and cheese for thanksgiving, and immediately went to the Food Lab, as one does. I think the recipe will work great overall, but I’ve never made it before and had a few questions.\n\n1.\tCan you make it a day or two ahead of time, and then fully bake it when it’s time to serve? Just not sure if that would be OK since eggs are being used. I can always make it the morning of thanksgiving and bake it once we get to the place we’re eating at, but it would be nice to avoid that if possible. \n2.\tWill it work to make it in one of those tin serving trays? I have a 9x13 casserole dish, but it could be nice to bring something disposable so I don’t have to remember to bring my dish home.\n3.\tWhat’s the best mix of cheese to use? I was thinking 16oz sharp cheddar, 8oz American, and 8oz smoked Gouda, but I’d love some other suggestions. My thinking was the smokiness would go well with turkey and give it a little extra “oomf” in general, just make it a little more special than regular mac. \n4.\tAre there any other simple additions that really make it stand out? Additional spices, etc? Was already planning to top it with a little fresh parsley. \n\nThanks in advanced for the help! Really hoping to knock this one out of the park.",

        "text": "I've cooked almost the entire FoodLab book, several times. Pretty much everything on the site from Kenji, Joshua Bousel (love your sauces man!), and anything else related to grilling and sauces. I live near almost exclusively Colombian and Venezuelan folks in south Florida, and I'm able to get very good pork belly cuts with the skin on. So I thought I'd try this [chicharrones recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-nasty-bits-how-to-make-chicharrones-recipe).\n\nWhile there are many comments talking about the insane splattering, they mostly discuss this at the end in the final lard frying.\n\nI let the kosher salt/baking soda rub sit for 24 hours overnight in the fridge on a wire rack.\n\nCut into 1 x 1 x 1/3\" pieces. \n\nPut in the cast iron pot (Staub cocotte). Covered with water.\n\nRendered the fat out.House smelled amazing for 2.5 hours. \n\nChecked it every 20 minutes, turning each piece.\n\nTurned the heat down, maybe not enough but it was between 2 and 0 on a 0-9. scale.\n\nThat's when things turned awful. The pieces started falling apart (how was I going to make crispy skin with fragments of pork that looked like miniature pork shoulder?), and 1/3 to 1/2 started sticking to the bottom of the pot. There was a massive splatter that hit my eyes. This should at least be mentioned in the recipe.\n\nTook them out, drained. Let rest to drain per other users comments that this is an essential step.\n\nBurned off the rest of the water, added some lard, got the heat high, about 6-8 on the 0-9 scale. Smelled like the lard was burning, reduced to 5-6.\n\nAdded back what was mostly very small miniature pulled pork pieces back in, not anything the size that looks like the recipe. Much of it cauterized into charred blackened charcoal.\n\nFeels like a waste of a day....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone had success with this recipe and if so what did you do differently?",

I was getting great results baking on the top rack in my gas oven that went to 550, then finishing with the broiler for the last minute or so to get the charred bubbles. \n\nRecently, I moved. The gas oven here only goes to 500, and the broiler is in a drawer in the bottom of the oven (This is the worse design feature I’ve ever encountered, btw, why would anyone want the maneuver the nearly-flaming food that close to the ground?). It has drastically changed my pizza’s texture. It’s much softer. And if I want to broil it, I have to maneuver it from the oven to the broiler by the floor without dropping it (plus my knees hate it).  \n\nI’ve noticed when I hit the broil button, the temperature on the display defaults to 525. Does this mean I can actually just preheat the whole thing with the broiler function and get the oven to 525? I’m hopeful that extra 25 degrees will help restore my crust to its former glory. \n\nSigned, \n\nSad about the state of my pizza now \n\nPS- send an Ooni, stat",

Once ready to cook (covered pan w foil), poured 2 cups of water into the bottom of the pot and placed lasagna onto  trivet in pot. Pressure cooker set to high for 24 min. and at the end of that cook cycle, let natural pressure release. Removed foil cover, my cooker doubles as an air fryer (ninja foodi 8 in 1) so air fried it uncovered for 5 minutes.\n\nMaking this in the future i would probably cook a minute or 2 less because the noodles were soft\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.vincenzosplate.com/beef-lasagna-recipe/](https://www.vincenzosplate.com/beef-lasagna-recipe/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5gzey0vkcy91.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ebc9103b21428787590a4fe76e7e8aced8c58c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v7f7py0vkcy91.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b642d1f919509b011111268c2e3c13f47ca549",

However his recipes also cost a lot of money to make and are so time consuming. I have 2 kids under 3 years. I’m craving creamy soup for fall. Any delicious soup recipes from Kenji that are a little more streamlined to make? Anything that involves a food processor adds so much time with prep and clean up.",

There are chicken recipes with seasoning so I’m considering trying one of those but I was wondering what recommendations people have. I would love to go a bit more flavorful than your usual turkey but I don’t think my grandma would appreciate Jamaican jerk Thanksgiving \n\nCould use recommendations for sides too, or flavorful/spicy/etc sauces that would go well with Thanksgiving dinner to provide an option that the culinary conservatives can skip",
