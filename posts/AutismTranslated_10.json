Like if I go out with friends and plans change it can be enough to trigger a meltdown or panic attack in me, or if something gets cancelled or anything really. If there's a change, it makes me extremely distressed. \n\nI mean I can ask my friends and family to accommodate this and make sure they try not to change plans but like 1 it's an embarrassing ask and 2 some change can't be prevented.\n\nSo yeah, I come here to know how to cope better with change lol",

Ever since at least middle school I’d come home and be absolutely exhausted every day, which I had assumed was from sports and working out. After sports and high school was over though the same thing would happen, now I assumed instead of sports and school it was from working. (I worked in the back room of a retail store for 3 years.) Once I had been promoted because I was the most efficient person there and hardest working it wasn’t as physical, but more stressful with managers that you could never get enough done to please. Now I don’t have school, sports, and my job is more relaxed but I still get as drained. I’m pretty sure this is what’s considered autistic fatigue? I was hoping if I stopped masking this would go away but I don’t know how. Within the next couple months I might also be able to get a wfh job, so I think that’ll help to.",

        "text": "My question is pretty much exactly what the title says. Pretty simple, I would think, but apparently not an easy question to answer, unless I'm just completely missing something. \n\nBasically item d of the dsm v criteria for autism states that \"symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning\". I don't know if my social functioning is impaired but I know my executive function is kinda bad. I'm not sure if it's clinically significant (though I'll say that I was working on a math project last week and was up until past 3 in the morning 2 days in a row because I didn't start working until 11:00 or midnight either night due to task initiation struggles and then proceeded to lose track of time once I had started and kept getting distracted by a bunch of different things which in the end prevented me from getting more than 4 hours of sleep so idk if that means anything in terms of clinical significance) but for the purpose of this post I'm just gonna assume that executive function falls under \"other areas\" (if it doesn't someone please tell me or tell me what else does fall under that because I found absolutely nothing on this topic) and that my executive dysfunction is clinically significant. \n\nThe final variable of that clause is that the symptoms cause the impairment in functioning. If I look up some common causes of executive dysfunction autism is one of them, but I don't know what specific symptoms cause it. Like I know I have enough symptoms and could provide concrete examples of all of them for a diagnosis, but I'm having trouble imagining how me staring at ceiling fans (way beyond the normal age because I'm old enough to remember doing it) or playing with my blocks the same way every time when I was little or walking on my toes or not making eye contact or anything else on the long list of my autistic traits resulted in my executive dysfunction. Like I said I found absolutely nothing in terms of what specifically causes executive dysfunction or if it even falls under the dsm criteria for other areas of functioning so I really have no idea. Anyone know?\n\nAlso I wanted to ask about imposter syndrome, as I read autism subreddits more and more I notice I don't relate to a lot of posts on them and the feeling is really getting to me despite the fact that I _know_ I have a lot of autistic symptoms/traits and fit all of the other diagnostic criteria. Does anyone know how to kinda reduce that feeling or am I like stuck with it lol\n\nand of course, as always, let me know if I've said anything offensive/against the rules so I can fix it",

        "text": "I've noticed some fundamental ways in how we communicate differently than NTs and I'd like to explain them here (at least some of them).\n\n- I was recently part of a bootcamp where we basically learned two things; A and B. At the end, the instructor asked \"which one did you like best, A or B?\" and we all had to answer it. EVERY single person said their choice AND added an explanation: \"oh, I liked A more because...\", \"At first I like A more too, but after we learned this I liked B more because...\" And I was confused because they didn't asked us why or to give any sort of explanation. When it was my turn, I said \"I liked B more.\" And there was a silent after, kind of like everyone was waiting for me to say something more but it didn't.\n\n- at the beginning of this bootcamp, when the instructor logged in (it was via zoom), she would say good morning and then EVERYONE would unmute and say good morning too. I never did because I felt it was unnecessary. I understood that the original good morning was the instructor just being polite but didn't need for EVERYONE to say it back. \n\n- when the instructor would ask a question, many people raised their hands. The instructor went one by one and let them talk. Problem is, everyone was saying the same thing. It was about 7 people all saying the same thing, one after the other. I never talked in these instances because everything I had to said had already been said. I didn't understand why they all kept talking.\n\n- many times I've said things like \"hmm that smells nice\", only to be asked \"do you want some?\". Like, that's not what I asked. I was just making a comment. I understand how in this example it may be an ok response, but ive gotten variations of this many many times. \n\n- I have this tendency to not ask questions. If I have a question, I'd much rather luck it up myself than ask. Many times I've asked questions and people have not really understood me or have given me an explanation that wasn't what I needed, which only makes me more anxious and I just leave it there. On this bootcamp everyone was asking every single little question they had. Even stupid ones that had nothing to do with what we were doing. Yes, asking questions is important, but I take this as a last resort, as knowing how to google is a far more valuable skill. I felt these people had no shame in asking questions.\n\n- this may be related to our intense need for justice, but on the bootcamp the people I was working with had no problem taken my ideas as their own. I ALWAYS give credit to those who actually did the work. \n\nMost of these are from a bootcamp I recently took part in but they apply to every other aspect of life. \nPlease share in the comments more examples of this you've noticed and if you relate to any I've mentioned!",

Sorry it's long and please let me know if it's inappropriate for this sub.\n\nI'm in my 20s and live with my senior parents because I've been dealing with severe burnout and underemployment. I'm working so, so hard to recover and I'm on a waitlist for an autism assessment. I'm hoping I might qualify for financial assistance with a diagnosis. In the meantime, it's a tough situation financially and personally.\n\nOne of my parents is having a hard time, largely because of the other parent (divorce isn't feasible) but also partly because I still live at home. I'm really doing my best to pull my weight but it's not enough. I hate being a burden and I feel a lot of guilt day-to-day. The parent says it's not my fault, but I know in their heart they blame me for at least some of their suffering.\n\nSo, the big problem: this parent keeps disclosing my suspected autism to people without my permission. They think they have the right to disclose because I'm making their life harder and they should be able to tell people exactly why they're struggling.\n\nThey told their sister, who has probably told all my cousins on that side. They told at least two of their friends, one of which had already heard about it from the sister. They also told their in-laws, so now both sides of the family know. \n\nI'm LIVID and I'm devastated. I told the parent from the beginning (and many times after) that they shouldn't tell anyone because it opens me up to stigma. I'm not ashamed to be possibly autistic, but most people don't get it and it's not something I'm ready to be open about. It's not the parent's information to share and it's a huge violation of my trust and my privacy. I hate that this information is out and making its way through the grapevine before I've even formally confirmed my suspicions. I'm scared to run into any of these people in case they treat me differently, and I'm reluctant to contact my cousins at all, even though I want to have relationships with them.\n\nI guess I'm looking for support or commiseration. Am I wrong for feeling so violated? What can I do? Is there any way I can convince them to stop? Has anyone been through something similar?",

Not that it “matters” but I guess my suspicion isn’t coming from thin air? \n\nMy mom is autistic and was diagnosed in college and then a second time later in life (she moved states and I’m not sure why she got a second diagnosis, I think it was required to speak with a psychologist during serving time in prison and they may have evaluated her then idk). \n\nI am diagnosed with ADHD as well. \n\nJust trying to figure out what “tendencies” can even mean because it’s so vague.",

I often struggle to match speed and walk side by side, and often bump into people I'm walking behind/in front of. \n\nI also used to occasionally walk on the fronts of my feet when I was younger, which I called the \"Halo Elite walk\" since they have like digitigrade legs. It wasn't often, but it was enough that I have several memories and had named it. \n\nI also didn't instinctively swings my arms when I walked until my parents kept pestering me about how that make me look creepy, so now I do. My partner said that she could always spot me at school because I'd be walking super fast, like kinda bouncing up and down, and not moving my arms, so I guess it was obvious enough to be registered from like across a courtyard.",

So hey 18 male ( Not diagnosed, suspect ASD ) So there's some moments I remember from my childhood though I have subpar memory skills. I hated barber shops as a kid, many times I would always cry from the pain of the razor clip ripping my hair out, I got free lollipops though. And I don't appreciate when the razor tickling behind my ears, makes me want to squirm ( Still do ). When I had to get vaccines I would always cry and try to move away to the point they had to hold me down to give me the vaccine. But I love the feeling after I got  vaccines, I would always press or rub on the band-aid to feel the soreness or slight pain it feels GOOD. Everytime my sibling would say something mean or do something I didn't like I would cry and scream on the top of my lungs. I vividly remember when my mom was trying to feed me rice and green peas and I started crying from not wanting eat it. I don't do this now, but I did have something like that about 4 months ago, my mom was telling me to go to school to finish High school in person ( I wanted online ) I didn't like in person school. She started yelling and I broke down crying and pacing and punched my closet door and started accusing her of not caring about me, we apologized to each other after. Idk if that was a meltdown. That's all I can remember right now sorry, can anyone relate to this? And could these be meltdowns?",

In general I think I am neurodivergent, but when it comes to communication my impression is that I do not fit clearly anywhere. \n\nI try conversations on my own before having them, or I re-do them afterwards to make them better (before knowing about “scripting” I would describe that as “writing in my mind”). I have a rigidity about truth, meaning that I go out of my way to avoid lying (that may be due to my upbringing, however) and I assume that everyone else is always telling the truth. I don’t enjoy laughing at people and am very uncomfortable when other people do that to me, I am not assertive (I tend to either shut up or explode in anger when I feel attacked) and so on, I have a low social battery, I am extremely uncomfortable with touching and being touched and I have difficulties with inserting myself in conversations with multiple people.\n\nAt the same time, however, I think I am pretty good at understanding body language and voice tone. I may misinterpret the reason why a person is behaving or feeling in a certain way, but I hardly miss the raw signal. When people want me to know they are being sarcastic, I pick on it; I don’t only when they are actually trying to deceive me. I have no problems with metaphors - I may visualize them funnily, for example if one says “it’s raining cats and dogs” I make up a mind picture of cats and dogs falling from the sky, but that’s it. I can do eye contact, sometimes I just become self conscious about it and so it feels artificial, but that is not the default.\n\nEspecially, what confuses me the most is that I am a people pleaser. I often read that autistics communicate directly while allistics tend to circle around their own message. In this part too I relate to the allistics more. I recall instances in which I was misinterpreted because people were assuming a hurtful meaning in my words that was nonexistent, and this made me develop a constant worry of offending people. I can’t conceive myself speaking directly anymore, because I am sure someone will be angry if I did. I still avoid lying out of kindness, however: let’s say, if you asked me whether I liked your new haircut and I didn’t, I couldn’t bring myself to answer “Yes, I love it”, but I may say “It’s very fashionable” or “It suits you” - and yet it’s still a circling around. \n\nTu sum up, I have the impression that my non verbal “style” is on the middle ground between allistic and autistic, and therefore I can’t fit the criteria for the spectrum. But I may be wrong, so I am very interested in reading your insight. Thank you very much for any answer!",

This is mostly a financial decision, I'm a 34 year old female and feel the research just hasn't caught up, although I have self tested with the RAADS-R and a few others and I am within range, although they cannot be deemed official as I was not tested by a professional. \n\nAnyway, there was another post on r/autismPDA by a person that has since deleted their account. I'd like to ask if this is the consensus/opinion of others, as to the experience of what PDA is in their own lives. To quote/copy pasta a -section- of what the user stated PDA felt like to them:\n\n\"My partner asked if it just affected obligations and chores but I had to say no. Even things I want to do, like playing a game or eating ice-cream can be exceptionally difficult to instigate.\n\nThe way I described it to her is like trying to fill a bucket of water using your hands, if the bucket represents the idea of doing something, and the water represents motivation. I will often feel hungry, walk into the kitchen and look at the fridge, then a pulling force physically stops me from opening the fridge, I can't make myself do it. Sometimes I do manage to open the fridge, but often swiftly close the door again. It's not a choice, it's compulsion.\"\n\nThey went on to explain further, and for them, another person initiating a task could be very helpful.  But my main point I'd like to take from this is I feel very similar to this hungry-fridge metaphor with my adhd. I want to do the thing. My body feels a pulling force from doing the thing. I am screaming at myself in my head, just do the thing! My body just tra-la-la ignores me. Even if I'm getting other tasks done. I could be filling the dishwasher, but I should be taking a shower because it's been 4 days since my last shower. \n\nMy adhd sounds the same as what this person describes as their PDA. I wonder if that is the experience for others or if that is just the experience for this person. Because, when I started adderall it was like unlocking my handcuffs. I had freedom of choice. I could choose to take a shower 85% of the time! It has been my prescription to give me freedom of choice. \n\n\nTL;DR how similar are ADHD and PDA? Another person that posted about their experience with PDA sounds pretty similar to my ADHD. Do they have ADHD or do I have PDA or are they just super similar it's hard to tell sometimes?",

        "text": "Hi everyone - I’m a 36-year-old gay male and received an autism diagnosis last year after deciding to get evaluated. I’m starting to acknowledge this part of my identity more after masking a lot due to shame.\n\nOne topic that’s been on my mind a lot is the tradeoffs of different types of colleges or universities for autistic students, for those who go to college. I graduated years ago, but at the time I knew I was off-beat and socially awkward (and hadn’t yet come out to anyone as gay). Reading college guides and going on tours, I was convinced that a small liberal arts college would be best for me. I latched onto Vassar in particular, and applied ED and got in and attended - my next choice probably would have been Wesleyan, which is a similar school.\n\nAt the time I worried I’d struggle more in a bigger university - I viewed LACs in general as a more nurturing environment, and accepting of different types of people. But now I sometimes wonder if the opposite route might have been better for me, and a larger university would have been better academically. At Vassar I generally did well on papers and assignments, but felt restless in classes that were heavy on discussion and barely said a word, particularly in social sciences. I just didn’t feel like talking was productive, and struggled to make good points when asked on the spot. I would rather write a paper since it had clearer guidelines and gave me time to organize my thoughts. I distinctly remember one tough poly sci professor praising a paper I’d written and getting an A on it, but her last written comment was “Is there nothing I can do to get you to contribute to class discussion?” (My mental response: “Probably not. Sorry!”) Also since it was a small school it was easily noticed by professors if you were being quiet - a few other professors addressed me about it in person and seemed concerned or bothered by it.\n\nI ended up majoring in math - I’d always liked it and excelled at it in high school, but also liked that the Vassar math classes were more structured than most subjects, with problem sets assigned after each class and minimal discussion. But I struggled a lot with some of the required upper level courses which were proof-heavy and where nothing was computational with hard numbers. The department had very few courses in statistics or more applied math. I remember driving one of my professors crazy in office hours because I seemed to have such a one-track way of approaching problems, and the type of thinking needed for her upper level course (Real Analysis) just eluded me. Since I’ve graduated the department has expanded their course offerings, and now lets you specialize in a Sub-field like statistics if you want. But the limited offerings were a definite issue for me, and this problem may persist at other LACs. \n\nA third issue I had (and related to the second) was that I received little guidance from professors on finding internships or career paths that were suitable for me. I was very fortunate to find a summer fellowship listing when doing my own browsing during junior year that was focused on survey research, and applied for it and got it, which set the stage for my career now. (Prior to that my only jobs had been in tutoring or a kids’ day camp.) But I sometimes wish I’d received better guidance. I don’t know if this would have been better in a larger research university or not.\n\nI know that’s a lot about me - just curious to hear about others’ thoughts and personal experiences.",

So hey 18 male ( Not diagnosed, suspect ASD ) So there's some moments I remember from my childhood though I have subpar memory skills. I hated barber shops as a kid, many times I would always cry from the pain of the razor clip ripping my hair out, I got free lollipops though. And I don't appreciate when the razor tickling behind my ears, makes me want to squirm ( Still do ). When I had to get vaccines I would always cry and try to move away to the point they had to hold me down to give me the vaccine. But I love the feeling after I got  vaccines, I would always press or rub on the band-aid to feel the soreness or slight pain it feels GOOD. Everytime my sibling would say something mean or do something I didn't like I would cry and scream on the top of my lungs. I vividly remember when my mom was trying to feed me rice and green peas and I started crying from not wanting eat it. I don't do this now, but I did have something like that about 4 months ago, my mom was telling me to go to school to finish High school in person ( I wanted online ) I didn't like in person school. She started yelling and I broke down crying and pacing and punched my closet door and started accusing her of not caring about me, we apologized to each other after. Idk if that was a meltdown. That's all I can remember right now sorry, can anyone relate to this? And could these be meltdowns?",

A lot of the time this actually works and allows me to fit in and seem a part of the conversation; however this can be difficult to achieve, with joining the conversation without interrupting someone and even just understanding what they’re talking about being a barrier. In addition, this *can* lead me to, as stated above, saying things impulsively that I don’t mean to say or what aren’t worded in the right ways.\n\nHave any of you also experienced something similar? Do you believe this to be an autistic trait? Have any of you read about other people experiencing this and/or is it a known trait?",

I'll feel like I've really shown that I care about someone or about other people in general and then bam, I'm being told that I need to have more empathy or put myself in someone else's shoes. I really have no clue what is going on. Here are some examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I'm in this DOR-funded career coaching program and this has come up multiple times. The first was when we were talking about job interviews and researching company culture. I said something about wanting to make sure the place I work doesn't treat me worse due to traits I was born with and can't control and want to learn how to find more subtle red flags. I got told I didn't have enough empathy for the people doing the hiring and should better accommodate their ignorance and be willing to educate. Another was when I was discussing at the end of a one-on-one with my coach things I don't like about autism parent culture on social media and when I said I wouldn't want to be filmed microwaving something and applauded on TikTok just for that while having the act of me microwaving somehow tied to my autism, I got told I was being insensitive and unempathetic toward the parent whose kid might have struggled for months to use the microwave, who might want to celebrate.\n2. I have this neighbor who is super into Feng Shui and all kinds of other New Age stuff. She has told me multiple times that my executive dysfunction must come from \"bad energy flow\" in my bedroom and has gifted me spray and a crystal to try to address this. When I tried to explain to her why I thought those were not appropriate, she eventually stormed away and went on this text rant about how I was a bad listener and didn't show empathy. Her boyfriend at the time agreed that I wasn't taking her perspective even though he also didn't share her beliefs.\n3. I started seeing this educational therapist and I had to sign some release forms. She sent me one for people who have guardians. At that point, I was at the end of my rope with healthcare providers assuming that I'm conserved or a little kid and called her on it. She then told me that I failed to take her perspective and that someone needed to work on social skills with me more.\n4. I got into a heated discussion about trans issues with this cis woman at a party and the host called me after and was super pissed at me, stating that I was just a \"privileged upper middle class kid with a white dad who knew nothing and needed to keep their mouth shut\" (I'm 25). I was so confused. I couldn't seem to get him to think about the transphobia I had experienced and was trying to point out at all.\n5. Basically through most of my K-12 , I was a gifted kid whose progress didn't matter, who was exploited as an unofficial, unpaid staff member for a lot of it, and when I would point that out to my teachers and to administrators, both they and other kids thought I was an \"insensitive bitch\" and I had a reputation for being extremely cocky and arrogant and not charitable enough toward my classmates. The same thing happened when I took a PEERS-style social skills class. The instructors thought I was a \"bad sport\" because I was upset that my needs didn't matter because my classmates were borderline not speaking in sentences.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "I look back on every relationship I've ever had, and they all were narcissists/had narcissistic traits. I've definitely taken stock after every relationship to see what I did wrong and how I could be a better partner, but I also can see that my partners have gaslit and manipulated me, became abusive, and used me (often financially)--some far more severely than others. After a lot of contemplation, I realized that I assume that other people are honest right from the start. However, every relationship partner turned out to just be telling me what they thought I wanted to hear, eventually outing themselves as having lied about everything in their personality. I guess that's what \"love bombing\" is. \n\nHow do I avoid this in the future? I realize that I often miss red flags, but when I do see them, I'm hesitant to immediately toss the person aside, because I hate to be judgmental. That's something I need to work on because it's bitten me in the butt so often. But, how else to I keep narcissists from zeroing in on me? It's like I'm wearing a neon sign that says \"please take advantage of me and treat me like garbage for as long as you can get away with it\". I'm actually afraid to even try to make friends anymore, let alone go out and date.\n\nThanks everyone for your thoughts.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, looking for advice and insights from the neurodivergent community.\nI should add before I share the issue; I (f38) also have c-ptsd, and quite some past relationship wounds having been cheated on.\n\nMy partner (m38) had a conference this weekend, which I knew about for months.\nLast Monday, he out of nowhere mentioned his female co-worker is also there, and they’ll be sharing a hotel room. He mentioned it like it was no big deal at all, said he was sure he told me before (absolutely not, I would have remembered), and was genuinely surprised I was upset.\nThe upset is layered:\n1. We communicated boundaries around trust, fidelity etc before, and I told him I’m not comfortable with him sharing sleeping spaces with female friends. To me, it invites too much intimacy, and that’s where I draw a line in order to feel emotionally safe.\nHe claimed to have forgotten this conversation.\n2. In a committed and monogamous relationship, I would have expected to check with me upfront if sharing a hotel room is ok. I would have had a chance to think about it, perhaps would have felt less threatened about it, but may have still said I did not feel comfortable.  \nInstead, he booked their room already in october (i demanded seeing the booking confirmation saying it was two single beds), and he only casually dropped this info on me this monday.\n3. He apologized, said there was too much on lately and he simply forgot and didn’t think it was a big deal.\n4. He offered the room to her. Apparently they are both speaking at the conference, he can get the room reimbursed and she can not, and he wanted to help. \n\nI tried to talk myself into thinking they are just coworkers, maybe he truly is clueless sometimes, but I did say multiple times this week I was really unhappy with this.\n\nOn Monday, when we had the fight about it, he offered as a solution that he wouldn’t go at all, which I found manipulative, putting on me that I’d get in the way of his career. It was basically posed as he goes and shares a room or doesn’t go at all, and this is incorrect; there could have been lots of other solutions found that did consider my discomfort and viewpoint. \n\nOn Thursday, when he left, I realized again how not well all this sits with me. \nI looked up hotelrooms, found cheap ones in the city center and again communicated that I am uncomfortable and want a different solution.\nHe cut all communication about the topic; he didn’t have the energy for it, he was too tired, he had nothing more to say  about the topic, my jealousy was my issue.\n\nSince then absolute minimal communication. I can not show kindness or care with such a big thing in between us, where I am forced to accept a boundary being crossed and being dismissed as irrationally jealous.\nYes, I have past wounds from being cheated on, and that past colors my current boundaries, but that does not make me irrational. \nAdded to it his dismissiveness and disconnect - it makes me feel even more uncared about.\n\nI have a have time determining when I am right, or wrong, or when my feelings are valid. A friend said that if there truly is nothing going on between them, he of course sees me as a drama queen. \nEven then, I would have hoped for more empathy and care from the person claiming to love me, and that is fully lacking at this point.\n\nI worry that my tendency for pattern recognition (‘forgetting’ to tell me, claiming to be obtuse of such a thing to be an issue, willful ignorance almost, which happened with other partners)are leading me to conclude the worst, combined with the past trauma being triggered.\n\nAt the same time, his disconnect and unwillingness to resolve this asap make want to fully disconnect from him and the relationship, despite rationally knowing he is at a conference and busy, but who is too busy to talk to their partner? I am clearly not a priority. \n\nIf the tables were turned, I would never disregard a partner stating a preference or need in order to feel emotionally safe, and to ensure the romantic partnership is still a priority. \n\nI need advice, or help understanding how I can determine if my gut is right or not.",

She said she has worked with adults who have autism and her son does too and I remind her of him (to her amusement). But she didn't want to write that down because my insurance wouldn't cover the sessions! So officially she's putting me down as having anxiety and that's what she wants to focus on anyway. She said anxiety and high-functioning ASD share many symptoms (needing structure, difficulty with change, etc), but most people don't notice and aren't affected by smells and sounds the way I am. She said I'm the only man who has ever told her his house smells nice...\n\nShe also said she thinks I have ADHD. I asked her if it's possible to have OCD, ADHD and ASD at the same time and she said yes. But she wants to focus on anxiety, and so do I, so I'm ok with not making anything official (it's not like I need accommodations or anything) I just want my therapist to understand me, and I think she does so far.\n\nAfter the session I realized I did not get an answer to the \"wouldn't have gotten this far in life\" statement. I asked for clarification but she either didn't say or I don't remember or misinterpreted somehow. She apologized for not explaining further, I guess maybe that's what her \"official statement\" was because of the insurance but not her real opinion? Or because she thinks my ASD is very mild and doesn't need treating the way my anxiety does? I'm not sure. I seem to misinterpret or fail to remember things a lot. I apologize for jumping the gun and making these posts without first waiting to ask her for clarification at the next session (she said it at the very end of the session and time was up) and for still not having a clear answer to the original statement...",

        "text": "*Disclaimer- these are just my thoughts and feelings on the items below and know that others might disagree and/or identify differently so what I am saying is not meant to discount anyone else's personal experiences or change any minds. I'm writing this to 1. get this off my chest but also 2. to get feedback from others and see if anyone else shares my perspective, or to see other perspectives to help me better understand. I don't present anything below as fact and I welcome other thoughts and perspectives because I am by no means an expert nor rigidly set in my opinions.*\n\n**Autism**\nMy understanding is that the term was initially coined by two people independently (supposedly) while studying a limited group of children who didn't interact with others, hence the root *\"aut\"* from the Greek *\"autos\"* or *\"self\"*. I feel this name applies a filter over everything related to how I am, implying something about being alone or independent. I don't want to be independent, lonely, alone, isolated, anything like that- I just have a hard time interacting with NTs so I end up that way.\n\n**Hans Asperger and Asperger's Syndrome**\nWhile Hans Asperger could have been a pioneer in understanding people like me, it is really unfortunate that he was where he was, when he was. I think a lot of people living and working in that area at the time of WWII had no choice but to be complicit, but also his participation in deciding who was fit or not is a bit more than just \"going with the flow\". I also feel that while I understand the decision to wrap Asperger's into the autism spectrum, that subset of characteristics most accurately describe me and it is more convenient to have a term specific to these certain characteristics. Being that I identify with the characteristics he studied the most, I feel like \"Asperger Syndrome\" is probably the closest label I'd identify with but I really have a hard time slapping his name on it, and therefore I don't. \n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\nI feel like using *\"disorder\"* referring to the autism spectrum is misleading. While my brain processes information differently than others it only becomes a disorder when how I am is applied to how society is normally structured by NTs (as Dr. Devon Price wrote in \"Unmasking Autism\"). I don't want to take away from anyone else's experiences who have much more severe characteristics, traits, or reactions because mine are mild compared to what I've heard others expressing, but when I talk about ASD about myself I think of the \"D\" as \"differences\". These are things that are genetically inherited and expressed in my interests and actions, but why does that have to be deemed a \"disorder\"?\n\n**Clinical diagnosis vs self-diagnosis/identification**\nI have not been through a formal assessment process so I can only speak to the self-diagnosis/identification side of this except for the experience I had watching my 13yo son go through the ADOS and be clinically diagnosed. I understand that as an adult the process is different for testing and/or assessment, but it seems to be that an assessment is a judgement call by a (hopefully) trained professional. It seems that a lot of people on this sub are a lot more informed than most doctors and therapists, probably because of their personal stake in the subject. What I see over and over again is hesitation by these people who are in-the-know about autism doubting themselves or being anxious that they won't get a diagnosis from someone else. I understand feeling the need for external validation, but a diagnosis is not as black and white as getting an Xray and seeing a broken bone. My path to self-diagnosis was fraught with thoughts of imposter syndrome and doubts based on \"in the range\" scores on those online tests. It was when I tossed those ideas away and did some deep examination of my past, who I am, and how I act paired with listening to and reflecting on some pretty astute observations from my wife of 20 years that I really felt comfortable identifying as autistic. Personally I don't need a doctor or anyone else to tell me what I feel about myself, although again I don't want to discount or diminish anyone else's individual needs/desires.\n\n**Person-first language and personal identification**\nThis seems to be a hot issue for some people, but I don't take either side very personally. As I said above, I don't agree with the name \"autism\" so I don't easily call myself a \"person with autism\". I also couldn't easily call myself a \"person with ASD\" because I don't identify with the disorder part of that name. But calling myself an \"autistic person\" also feels wrong because it defines me as autistic before being a person. I am still a person, autism or not. As I said earlier I think that what would feel best for me is if there was a name for the specific subset of characteristics (from the autism spectrum) that I have, like \"Asperger's Syndrome\" but without the Nazi association. The definition of \"syndrome\" is \"a group of symptoms which consistently occur together, or a condition characterised by a set of associated symptoms\". If there was a way to group and identify the symptoms I have accurately and inoffensively, I feel that would best serve me. Until that time, I think I have to work within the confines of the pre-established naming system which best describes me even if I don't 100% agree with it.\n\n**Summary**\nI hope I didn't offend anyone or misrepresent anything. My word is *not* fact, only perspective and opinion. I welcome discussion in this post and I look forward to hearing other people's perspectives. Thanks for reading all this (if you got this far).",

For some reason though it ALWAYS offends the person who is angry at me. How do I properly explain that my actions are because I am angry and disappointed by myself for making the mistake? The object I throw is never something I don't own, so the only one who loses the thing is me. \n\nI'm just scared that one day I'll just fling myself off a window just to say sorry and atone myself by getting rid of the problem...",

        "text": "I am a 31 year old male, since as long as I remember I wanted to be alone. When I was a kid I did not understand other kids, I thought that I was different from them and I hated eye contact with others. I had the worst possible time with sounds and lights (I could never sleep with any kind of noise or light). However, most of all I despised anybody's touch, it made my skin crawl and made me furious. My mother forced me to learn how to make eye contact and forced me to be integrated in a public school with lots of extracurricular activities. So I learned how to mask and mimic socially accepted behaviour at school up to university, with some autistic events in between like when I told my teacher at school that they provided wrong information to the students and thought that is an unforgivable sin. However, I was still struggling with making lasting relationships and finding connection with the other sex (I am straight). Since I managed to succeed at school and I was a bit smarter than most in my life. That strength masked my autistic traits to others due to the stereotype of autists being mentally challenged where I grew up. So I never associated myself of being autistic just a bit different from everyone else. I even had many girls crush over me but I could not understand how to respond that was a skill I never learned, due to me being in a conservative upbringing and was told that I should refrain for any sexual acts(which I took literally like any autist does). Even got close to having a girlfriend at university. I thought I was normal up until I started working as a nurse in a highly stressful environment. That is when I started showing severe autistic traits again, after being sensory overwhelmed I would shut myself in my dark rooms for weeks. I t become harder and more jarring for me to write or do shores that sounded easy for me before. I could not understand what was happening to me, I thought I was lazy due to the continuous gaslighting I got thought out all of my life from my parents, and closest brother and society. I thought I had a neurological disorder and maybe severe depression with anorexia. I went to several psychiatrists and due to them not dealing with many adult autists and my near perfect masking all them misdiagnosed me. I even thought I had a terminal disease and I was dying because I discovered that I had an autoimmune disorder. Things get better and then they become much worse again until I met my recent psychologist. I think she knew I was autistic from the first or second session and started to ease me to the topic session by session until recently she came up with the topic of childhood trauma and got to how I acted when I was a kid and about my special interests and how about I hated being touched. She then started to tell me to pursue my interests (poetry and arts) again, as I thought they were a waste of time, she implied that they will help me a lot for my mental wellbeing. Then she gave me an example about the physical touch from the show \"the good doctor\" about an autistic person falling in love and finally accepting the touch of another even though he was different he could become loved. That's when it all clicked I was treated in special way by my mother and some of her family members all my life. All the gaslighting and the high expectations, the name calling the lack of understanding all made sense. I was way too harsh on myself for being different  I masked everything and tried too hard to be normal I said the problem is with me, so I need to fix myself never felt proud of what I achieved and hated myself for not being like the others and not understanding them. No matter how much I tried it didn't seem enough. Three days ago I forgave myself and realized how cruel the world was and how I underestimated myself, how I was the most that was gaslighting myself. I felt the most relieved I had ever felt in my life. However now I am wondering what's next, how do I cope now, how do I continue to live how do I trust people again? because I need help going through everything. I hope I don't breakdown or burnout, I still want to work it provides with satisfaction. I don't know where to go from here. I now realize that I am autistic.",
