        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zxioo6/why_is_the_whole_is_greater_than_its_parts_not/",
        "text": "In the book \"How to Read a Book\" by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren, in chapter 8, it is claimed that the preposition \"a father of a father is a grandfather\" is a tautology, however \"the whole is greater than its parts\" is not. He says that the former statement only thinly conceals the verbal stipulation, \"Let us call the parent of a parent a 'grandparent.' \"\n\nThen, the explanation is expanded on, but I didn't quite understand it, or wasn't convinced by it. Here is the explanation it gives:\n\n&gt;The statement, \"The whole is greater than its parts,\" expresses our understanding of things as they are and of their relationships, which would be the same no matter what words we used or how we set up our linguistic conventions. Finite quantitative wholes exist and they have definite finite parts; for example, this page can be cut in half or in quarters. Now, as we understand a finite whole (that is, any finite whole) and as we understand a definite part of a finite whole, we understand the whole to be greater than the part, or the part to be less than the whole. So far is this from being a mere verbal matter that we cannot define the meaning of the words \"whole\" and \"part\"; these words express primitive or indefinable notions. As we are unable to define them *separately*, all we can do is express our understanding of whole and part by a statement of how wholes and parts are *related*.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The statement is axiomatic or self-evident in the sense that its opposite is immediately seen to be false. We can use the word \"part\" for this page, and the word \"whole\" for a half of this page after cutting it in two, but we cannot think that the page before it is cut is less than the half of it that we have in our hand after we have cut it. However we use language, our understanding of finite wholes and their definite parts is such that we are compelled to say that we know that the whole is greater than the part, and what we know is the relation between existent wholes and their parts, not something about the use of words or their meanings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Such self-evident propositions, then, have the status of indemonstrable but also undeniable truths. They are based on common experience alone and are part of common sense knowledge, for they belong to no organized body of knowledge; they do not belong to philosophy or mathematics any more than they belong to science or history. That is why, incidentally, Euclid called them \"common notions.\" They are also instructive, despite the fact that Locke, for example, did not think they were. He could see no difference between a proposition that really does not instruct, such as the one about the grandparent, and one that does—one that teaches us something we would not otherwise know—such as the one about parts and wholes. And those moderns who refer to all such propositions as tautologies make the same mistake. They do not see that some of the propositions they call \"tautologies\" really add to our knowledge, while others, of course, do not.\n\nWhat I didn't understand is the following:\n\n1. It says that \"whole\" and \"part\" are impossible to define without referring to one another. But is it not possible to define \"whole\" as: \"the entirety of something\", and \"part\" as \"a piece or segment of something such as an object, activity, or period of time, which combined with other pieces makes up the whole\"? Now \"whole\" is defined without referring to \"part\", correct?\n2. Furthermore, he says the statement about the whole can teach us something. But also claims that is self-evident, and a common notion. How can it teach us anything, if it is self-evident? What exactly does it teach us? Does it not immediately follow from the definition of whole and parts, just like the proposition about the grandfather does? How does it add to our knowledge, if it is being claimed that it is a self-evident notion, or in other words something that everyone already knows?\n\n**In summary:** It seems to me that both \"a father of a father is a grandfather\" and \"a whole is greater than its parts\" both follow from the definitions of \"father\"/\"grandfather\" and of \"whole\"/\"part\". They both seem to be equally obvious and redundant. Is there really a difference in those statements, that makes the latter one be deeper or more useful? I'd appreciate if there's any other material that discusses this.",

        "text": "I just recently read about eidetic reduction in phenomenology, which can be loosely summarized as thinking about an object and altering its properties so much that at some point, it ceases to become that object anymore. With eidetic reduction, one arrives at some \"essential property\" of an object. Sounds familiar, huh?\n\nIsn't this also the case with Kripke when thinking about counterfactuals. I'm not an expert at Kripke, I just think that I'm familiar enough with him to raise this topic. It is not so much I think that Kripke believes in \"invariant\", \"essential\", or \"immutable\" properties of an object, but it is a logical consequence of his theory of names. \n\nTake water, for example. Through thinking of the counterfactuals, we can find that properties such as \"being liquid at room temperature\", \"being tasteless\", \"being transparent\" are contingent properties which are to be distinguished from \"invariant\" ones like \"being H20\". One can imagine a counterfactual situation where water takes all the properties of alcohol yet it is still H20, therefore still is water, not alcohol. But one cannot imagine the reverse, water having all the properties of water in actual world but not H20, such substance cannot be called water. \n\nI can post more examples with people such as Aristotle, President Nixon, or heavenly bodies like Venus, but the point is still same. What differentiates Kripke's theory of naming or the consequences of his theory of naming and phenomenology's eidetic reduction? Having someone familiar with both will hopefully expand my understanding on both. Thank you!",

Some Gnostic traditions held that God both was masculine and feminine; the Kabbalists hold that there are masculine and feminine Sephiroth, in other traditions there are masculine and feminine planets, etc. Today, we could see this as people projecting gender onto things other than human beings, but it seems that people in ancient times had the exact opposite view. \n\nGender, for them, was a metaphysical principle which all things fell under. If human beings had any form of gender, it is simply because they were an instance of the division that organized all of reality. To my understanding, this idea can also be found in some of the more \"notable\" philosophers as well (I remember reading in Thomas Lacquer's book that Aristotle had something similar in his Biology). \n\nToday, however, gender is primarily thought in terms of society and subjectivity. It has nothing to do with some God or universal principle but just a type of \"difference\" that's instituted through various means (what clothes you wear, what labor you do, etc.).   \n\n\nWhen did this change happen, and why did it occur?",

Beiser's *Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900* which focuses on a period of time when philosophical pessimism had a notable influence on German public intellectual life. \n\nOne particular section of the book focuses on two women (Agnes Taubert and Olga Plümacher) who had a significant role in advocating for a pessimistic worldview and defending pessimism against its critics. Beiser's discussion of Taubert and Plümacher was a really interesting section of the book and has some great details. For example, Plümacher had a huge influence on the so-called \"pessimism controversy\" despite having no formal university education and living most of her life in the Tennessee backwoods.   \n\nIt got me thinking more broadly about women in philosophy who would be considered philosophical pessimists but none came to mind. There's no doubt there are some practical constraints here. For example, philosophical pessimism is a minority position in the first place, which means there is already a limited sample to draw from. Relatedly, [women are underrepresented in philosophy](https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/244-the-diversity-of-philosophy-students-and-faculty-in-the-united-states) which further limits the sample. Then there are the various socialization influences that may discourage women from pursuing philosophical pessimism.   \n\nNonetheless, I was curious if others knew of examples where women in philosophy advocated for pessimism. That might be a tough ask, so suggestions of women who aren't professional philosophers but advocate for pessimism would be great too. I'm particularly interested in contemporary examples, but any guidance would be appreciated!",

It does border on some kind of non-sanity, but the points it makes can be pretty logical to an imaginative mind.\n\nAnyways, I've read more than once that the existence of diseases, such as cancer, sclerosis, etc. are a good indication that materialism is true and Idealism is a wishy-washy theory. It does seem like a strong argument, but I'm still learning about Idealism so maybe there is subtle stuff that these arguments are ignoring. If Idealism was true, or constituted a broad spectre of reality, then diseases wouldn't exist. Yet, here they are. We can't control them, we can't do anything to stop them, etc. \n\nIs this a good argument or just a misinterpretation/misunderstanding of the philosophy? I'd like to get some good answers.",

First of all I have to say that english is not my first language so i’ll try my best but it can be said weirdly sometimes.\n\nSo, I wanted to understand better the hegelian dialectic and i wanted to know what was Kojève’s point of view because i knew that he was considered very interesting on that point.\n\nI thought that Kojève was a marxist (even a Stalinist in his own words (maybe he was joking ?…)) but i discovered that he added a note on his introduction for reading Hegel in which he said that the end of the history happened in The United States, and that it was the real communism and a classless society because everyone had access to property. He even said « Marx is god, Ford is his Prophet ».\n\nIsn’t this anti-marxist ? Marx said that the bourgeoisie are the one that own the means of production and that one of the revolution’s goal was to take it from them. I don’t think that any of these happened in the united states.

At first i thought that he could be really important in a marxist education, but now I don’t really know..\n\n-Why did He call Himself a marxist, I don’t see anything marxist in his thought ?\n\n-Why is he considered so important and so revolutionary in the understanding of Hegel ? A lot of great intellectuals listened to him. \n\n\nThank you a lot for your time. It is my first question asked on reddit so I hope i didn’t make any mistake. I usually only read your posts but I really want to understand this.\n\nThank you a lot.",

If you reduce everything down to a philosophy of science however, that doesn't make any sense.\n\nHuman beings are mammals. We, like all other mammals, have a brain that effectively functions as an analogue computer. We often try to rationalize our complexity with sentience or consciousness, and have essentially tricked ourselves into thinking that a machine could randomly develop such traits. However our complexity holds no specific threshold and I think it's largely just a consequence of us not comprehending how complicated we are (I mean, can the brain comprehend itself). Similar to how we made up the idea that lightning was the gods being angry, until we learned it was actually caused by a static charge build up in a cloud. Things we don't understand end up just having a made up concept thrown onto it.\n\nWith that said, it's not easy to differentiate ourselves from other animals. And so when it comes to moral judgement, we ascribe people as good or bad, but not other animals. So what's the biological threshold?\n\nMaybe it's an organism that must be classified as human? Or homonin? Okay... But what about Homo Erectus or Neanderthals?? Would we ascribe moral judgement to earlier humans that lived before us?? Or do we see them as too primal?\n\nMaybe the threshold must be that you're a Homo Sapien. Okay... But what about uncontacted tribes?? Take the Sentinalese for example. If I were to travel there and end up getting killed by the inhabitants, I'd be the one blamed for going to the island in the first place, and I'd be in the wrong. But if the Sentinalese were even slightly more modern with factory made clothes, somewhat modern construction and maybe a few with an internet connection, all while speaking a nationally recognized language, then they'd be the ones blamed and they'd be called murderers.\n\nSo what's the threshold from turning curiosity into judgement? When the seek to understand why harm was done turns into antagonism with almost deliberate suppression of understanding.",

I don't understand how this can be correct, though, because said process itself relies on causality to occur. More clearly, the interaction between the thing-in-itself and the category \"causality\" \\*causes\\* me to perceive some phenomenon. If that's true, though, then this process isn't contained to the phenomenal world, but rather occurs within the world of things-in-themselves, implying that causality is not just a category but a real mind-independent process.

Everything within the universe  that we suggest exist because the statement depends on the \"thing\" either being observed or measured. Although the statement of existence relies on a conscious act, the existence of the \"thing\" isn't necessarily dependent on a consciousness.\n\nGiven we accept the existence of the \"thing\" provided we observe it, let's probe the situation beyond observation and reality. Can we still argue for its existence if we were to \"observe\" beyond this 3 dimensional reality? Or let's say beyond time and space, this universe as a whole? Does existence loose it's meaning all together as it's dependent on the logical understanding of our reality? \n\nIf not... could we suggest that the existence of the \"thing\" is not necessary and does indeed rely on certain assumptions: \n\n1. Our 3 dimensional universe is all there is.\n2. Our existence is invariant despite other planes of reality.\n\nNow I am no means an academic or a student of philosophy and all that I have said could just be crazy talk, which is why want to learn more and if there are fallacies that needs to be addressed in my line of reasoning.

Through research of this issue I have come across the Non Identity Problem and can see how this applies to the question of the morality of eating meat. \n\nI am having some trouble making the logical jump that seems to be assumed in examples I’ve come across, namely that a _life worth living, even though flawed, is preferable to non existence._\n\nTo clarify, let’s use the example of a women who wants to have a child. A doctor tells her if she has the child now, it will be blind. If she waits and takes medicine for a month the baby she has then will not be blind. She decides to have the child now and the baby is born blind. \n\nThere is an instinctually feeling (for me) that she did something immoral. She was selfish to not wait a short amount of time. But it seems that there is a legitimate question on the morality of the action due to our agreed definition of person affecting. \n\nWhen reading about person affecting morality, it seems there is some requirement that the person being affected must have existed before the action in order for this to apply. If we agree with the requirement the person had to exist prior, then yes this example seems to cause questions in our definition of morality. \n\nWhy does the person need to exist before the action for us to consider this immoral? Regardless of the existence, the baby suffered from an action. \n\nWhy can we 1) not assign a moral “wrong” to someone who did not exist before the action and 2) assume that existing is preferable to not existing?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zwgdwd/if_we_cant_fully_know_a_designersupernatural/",
        "text": "There is a common argument by atheists that we simply can't know God's intentions and is considered a weak point in the design argument. See Elliott Sober's paper on this subject for example: [https://philpapers.org/rec/SOBTDA](https://philpapers.org/rec/SOBTDA). Usually, this is based on analogical reasoning, in that all designers we've observed have been human. Given that God, atleast on its traditional conception, must be much more intelligent than us, the argument is that we can't know His/Her intentions. He is too different than us so to speak.\n\nIn Bayesian terms, we can't know the likelihood of God doing any action given an observation. I.e. for an observation O, we can't know P (O|G), given that G represents the God hypothesis. This seems to me a pretty weak argument. since this seems to invalidate any piece of evidence. For example, even if in a book there were a series of specific predictions claimed to be by God, such as of the form \"On July 7 2025, a person by the name of Jenny will do certain actions at this time\", and it came true, one could still use the same earlier argument. One could again assume that there's no reason for God to actually follow through on that prediction for example, or assume ignorance of what He would do despite the successful prediction, even if that prediction being right had a very low probability of coming about by chance.\n\nHow does one then reconcile this? A further problem is that we assume actions from agents that we technically haven't seen before all the time. For example, suppose we have reliable evidence for murder. We can use our prior experience of humans doing murder where we had similar evidence to reasonably conclude that a particular human by the name of Adam committed it. But we don't actually have prior experience of **Adam** committing murder. We just assume he'll behave similarly because he's a human being. The concept of a human being ultimately just means that Adam shares certain properties with other humans, and this allows us to make an inductive reference.\n\nBut why can't God share certain properties with humans? One could argue, of course, and quite intuitively and obviously, that one human is more similar to another than God is to a human. First, although this seems intuitive, I'm not sure how one can objectively state this as a matter of fact. Any entity can potentially have an infinite number of properties and thus you would have to point out which properties are more relevant and how many are shared between two entities. Secondly, what if the properties that are similar between a human being and God are similar **enough** to warrant an analogical reference when it comes to design? For example, a property that a human and God share is the property of being a designer. As such, what exactly is wrong about an inductive inference that uses our history of designers (even if they are all human) to make an inference about God? Any counter to this would amount to \"because God doesn't share certain properties with humans.\" But this is also true of Adam. Adam may not share certain properties with other humans.",

He doesn’t put an emphasis on individualism and from my interpretation believes that freedom of the individual creates an unstable society.\n\nI would also argue he isn’t fascist or totalitarian due to his ideology on goodness and happiness for the state. He isn’t interested in power like the two mentioned. \n\nSo where does that leave Plato on this scale?",

        "text": "You know those super popular console choice based games? (Life is strange, Detroit, until dawn, etc.)\nWell, the point of them is to adapt to each person’s way of thinking and personality and unroll an ending based on your own choices throughout the game. Why do why I love these type of games? It’s almost like you’re part of it because it’s an interactive piece. I like to put myself in the shoes of the character I’m playing and like to imagine the choices I’m making are the choices I’d make if that situation was presented to me in real life. It’s a form of getting to know myself better because I get to see the consequences of my own actions and then reflect on them based on the end that I get and see if I should change my way of thinking or not, based on if I’m pleased with the result or not. \nWell, suppose you’re playing one of these games, and suddenly you’re presented with a big decision. You make up your mind and you make your choice, but then you end up regretting your decision right after because what the character does is not what you exactly thought they would do. Would you go back to your previous saved log, or would you accept it and keep playing the game? This happened to me, I didn’t like what my character did right after because I misunderstood the information and didn’t realize what would happen with that choice when I was supposed to. The consequence of the choice ended up being something that goes against my moral beliefs — I would never do that in real life and I would definitely pick the other option — again, I didn’t realize that I was doing what I was doing - so I felt wronged and wanted to go back and change, but that also goes against one of my principles which is never go back on a choice you make and just let the game run its course, like, just accept it even if you messed up. The only thing that gets me here is that I feel like I messed up because I wasn’t aware of what picking that option would actually do, basically I felt like the information that was given on the choice prompt wasn’t enough to completely understand what would happen .. so idk, would you go back on your choice because you felt like deep down that wasn’t what you picked, or would you just accept it and go by the principle that if you want to be authentic you should always stick to your first choice after it’s made, even if it turns out to be nothing like what you were expecting? I just feel like I ruined my story and like it wasn’t my fault because I didn’t mean to do that and the character did regardless",

It has to be singular. \n\nThe second that there is somehow some way to measure evil outside of a utilitarian method \n\nThe mens rea has to be factored in. \n\nI.e. one person commits genocide to advance their agenda of promoting supremacy of their  ideal race is worse than somebody commitimg genocide because they intrinsically believe by not doing so a greater harm will befall everybody.

The topic always gives me a bit of a headache as the discussion always seems to reduce to one of two arguments.\n\n1) On the one hand, you've got the people who say something in the orbit of \"justice *is* mercy\". At first glance, it looks like the bulk of these folks are usually the ones who defend traditional/authoritarian structures. There's *a lot* of material here (the first few pages of Google results for me are saturated by religious-institution-sponsored explainers). To me, all of these sources reduce to saying the same thing plus an obnoxious amount of mental gymnastics, often so much that the effort required to unravel it all isn't worth it for most people. This isn't to say that there *aren't* well-formed arguments here (whether I agree with them or not). However, if I'm going to have to fight back childhood gaslighting flashbacks, I'd prefer to dedicate that effort to a serious source lol.\n\n2) On the other hand, you've got the critics of the type-1 sources above. I'm sure there's an abundance of decent sources here. However, between type-1 interests saturating typical search options, the torrent of social media discussion on the topic (with which I sympathize, but which I can't exactly call a serious source either), and my own lack of experience with the topic, I can't seem to pierce through to anything meaty.\n\nSo, I'd love some recommendations for sources of either type, preferably secular academic sources, although I wouldn't mind theological academic sources to complement the first.\n\nI'll also take a short soapbox here and say that this topic really seems like it'd be in the domain of the philosophy of law but that law seems like a difficult thing to casually read about online...? Maybe it's just my STEM brain talking, but the process of consulting Wikipedia for punchy vocab then branching into better sources from there doesn't seem to work as well for law lol.",
