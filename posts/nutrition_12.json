My hypothesis based on this is that some people may do better on plant based, while others may do better on meat, depending on what their ancestors ate. \n2. In your opinion, what is THE best nutritionist / nutrition philosophy? Two opposing ones that come to mind for me are Weston A. Price vs. Dr. Sebi\n3. Why do we need meat/eggs? Protein (duh.) but if protein is broken down into amino acid, why do we need meat as a source of amino acid vs a 99% bioavailable amino acid supplement for example? We also need meat/eggs for micronutrients, but are micronutrients from meat superior to micronutrients from plants??? Certain micronutrients are not found in high content in meats, such as B12, but I think the reason for this is soil depletion, which in my opinion, is THE issue with plant based diets. Zach Bush says 97-99% of our soils are totally depleted!!! \n4. For those of you who are set on a primarily animal product diet, WHY? (Be specific) and what role do fruit and veggies play?\n\nSo open to anything and everything that can help me with figuring out what the best diet truly is!!!",
