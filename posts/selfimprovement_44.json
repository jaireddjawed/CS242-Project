I want to improve but i’m scared people will make fun of me or think i’m being stupid or hypocritical for changing my way of thinking. That’s what scares me the most really - being an outcast and not fitting in. But i don’t think making fun of someone for being white is a good way to fit in - it’s not. \n\nI’ve been cutting down the jokes but im just scared of peoples opinions. But i don’t think that should matter, i know what im doing, i have control over my words and actions, and i want to change.",

        "text": "Hey guys 😊 I’ve recently been falling into a cycle of bad habits and just being overall unproductive. I feel as though I have an “addictive personality” (not sure if it’s a real thing or me excusing how far I’ve let my discipline go) These things include constant vaping, smoking cannabis, scrolling social media, gaming,  watching porn, and eating fast food. My adhd meds have stopped working, my head is foggy and I often stare blankly out in public.\n\nI wanted to ask and clarify things about the dopamine system and how I can actually maintain a healthy dopamine baseline. I like to understand things as it helps me with planning and taking action. Sorry it’s so long my brain is scattered and if I try to edit it down it’ll get longer.\n\nI thought a “dopamine detox” was the way to go. It made a lot of sense to me. ie refraining/limiting oneself from activities that produce dopamine in the form of instant gratification (good example I think is watching porn and edging which maintains a high with each click) and introducing things that bring long term gratification and feelings of accomplishment ie exercise, social interactions, learning a new skill, passion projects or w/e (things that produce Serotonin) it made a lot of sense to me. That if we don’t control ourselves when it comes to “cheap highs” our baseline dopamine goes down because our body stops producing as much of it on its own or our baseline feels lower because we keep chasing higher highs. Therefore making everyday things less pleasurable. Like how someone born in the 2000s isn’t as likely to enjoy the little things and moments like someone born in the 90s. (not roasting generations you get what I mean lol) When people were less in their heads and technology wasn’t as developed.\n\nBut now I’ve come to find that this so called “Dopamine Detox” thing is a fad and that it isn’t real? I don’t like how all these psychology students or so called brain experts just call it a fad and even go to say it does nothing or not providing what a detox can actually do. I’d think that doing this detox has to have benefits maybe in the form of discipline, mindfulness, attention span or being able to enjoy everyday things more. But my question is what does this look like in the brain if it doesn’t pertain to our dopamine? Like I get that say Vaping for example becomes addictive through habit building and rewiring of the brain but it stems from the dopamine up/down changes.\n\nI also thought my meds stopped working because I went so far with my bad habits. In that my baseline dopamine is so low that now even the meds can’t compensate. But now I’m hearing that let’s say Nicotine or Caffeine uses different receptors and that there’s no cross tolerance?",

I’m now pretty handsome, 6,4 and in the best shape of anyone at my entire university. However, I’m still pretty quiet and awful at flirting with girls as until university my extent of speaking to girls just involved them making fun of me. I’m not big on the idea of sleeping around so I’d like to find a girlfriend but attractive girls are few and far between at my uni. I’m sure I can attract the type of girls I’d want as I have no issues attracting 8+/10 girls when I visit friends in cities or on tinder. However they all live very far away. When I do see an attractive girl here I find it really daunting to speak to them as they’re often surrounded by a force field of other guys trying to shoot their shot as it’s likely they’re the best looking girl in the club. As I’m not super confident this makes it especially hard for me to get a chance. Has anyone got any advice on what I could do to improve this area of my life? Of course I’m not looking for sympathy as I’m sure I’m in a much better situation than most guys but I am struggling with this and any advice would be much appreciated. I’m very confused on where I should be setting my standards.",

        "text": "I've recently read in a book that the best way to give off a friendly smile while talking to someone, is to smile during and after you say something that you think warrants a smile. \n\nThe author then supported this claim by talking about his own little social experiment. The author smiled three different ways when he was talking to people.\n\n1) Smiling all the time - this made him look condescending towards the people he was interacting with, which brought some tension in the conversation.\n\n2) Smiling only after he said something which he thought warranted a smile - this made him look suspicious, like he was up to something. \n\n3) Smiling during and after he said something which he thought warranted a smile - this made him look friendly and genuinely interested in the conversation. \n\nNow here is my issue; I'm not one to really show much emotions during conversations. Usually I would try to do a light smile when talking to someone, and keep it up during the whole conversation. I'm afraid that if I don't do a light smile, I might give off of a cold / uninterested vibe. \n\nHow should I incorporate my technique and the authors technique when I'm talking to someone? Should I keep it at a light smile, and then give off a bigger smile when I feel like the topic warrants it? \n\nI don't want to give off the impression that I'm a cold person, but I also don't want to give off the impression that I'm about to con them out of something lol.",

I study CS and I'm about to finish my masters. I did work at several corporations as software developer intern/part-timer and while I love programming/problem solving, I absolutely hate corporate bullshit. Meetings that don't make sense, forced team building that don't make sense, your project getting thrown out of the window so your work doesn't make sense. \n\nAnd I was there only as a part-timer, people work there full-time and even take extra hours. But I can't imagine living like this in the future. The job would squeeze the soul out of me.\n\nFor the last six months instead of having corporate job, I have been delivering food and honestly I can enjoy myself a whole lot more. Nobody is expecting me to clock huge hours, I can work only 10 hours one week if I want or 50 hours other week if I want. I have time to workout every day, to read kindle every day and for the last 2 months I have been even starting a side business. All of this while finishing my masters. I don't think I would be able to do as much with full-time corporate job.\n\nOnly downside is the pay. Corporate IT full-time job can get me 10x than part-time gig worker. Part of me feels I should go the route that will earn me more, but I'm frugal, I honestly can live quite comfortably even now. I don't travel, I don't go out, I don't own a car. I cook for myself, I have a homegym, I repair my stuff. But when I compare myself to friends, having this kind of life seem like I'm a looser.\n\nHonestly I don't know if I should pursue high-paying career or just go with low-paying part-time gig work. Part of me feel like I'm going to regret it later. Any advice?",

        "text": "TLDR: Asking for advice on what to do after I cut off two people I am very close with for betraying my trust. \n\nHi, I have been actively practicing self-improvement for the past months and feel much better emotionally, physically and mentally. In noticing these changes I have found it easier to deny short-term happiness for the long-term, however, I have made a pretty hard choice to cut two people that I am close to off.\n\nFor context, I have moved to another city for university and have become good friends with 2 girls (A &amp; B) that lived in my accom. At one point A and I were pretty much dating and would spend a lot of time with each other, and naturally B and I became closer given A and B are roommates and I would spend a lot of time over there. A and I are no longer 'together' due to external reasons.\n\nAnyway, I recently found out about some stuff A and B had done whilst I was with A- very discomforting stuff. It wasn't anything crazy but still enough to make someone end a relationship or at least question the person they are with. B was encouraging A to do things, albeit A never did them, but the principle of it all makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nThe reason I have an issue with this as much as I do is that I only show my vulnerable side to a set amount of people and to find out that A and B were lying and doing stuff behind my back is annoying. I have decided to cut them off because of it (on top of the fact that they don't have any good habits and prefer to smoke rather than go to uni for example) \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't hold a grudge or actively dislike them, I'm doing it out of self-respect and I genuinely believe this will help my growth. However, these are the two people I hang out with the most (I have other friends in the accom but tend to click with these guys more). If I'm being honest, I'm kinda scared to see how things go after it's done, I don't think I'll be socialising as much which is something I like to do as it balances out with the constant work I so throughout the day\n\n. So my question is, how do I deal with it? \n\n(I'm gonna have a conversation with them and be fully open instead of ghosting them and explain why I want to cut them off later)\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how to move forward from this that would be greatly appreciated.",

i dont even have high school finished im just a failure, right now i just dont care about my life if something happens to me maybe my mom will miss me or maybe not i dont know im just a weight in her shoulder, my father i dont talk to him for like 5+ years i start having a bad relation with him since i was addicted to weed, life for me showed me since i was a kid it will be hard and with the stupid decisions i made it made me a loser if i could back in time i would change everything i would change school when i was bullied, finish my course, never smoked weed if i could do this maybe today i would have a nice job, girlfriend maybe, but i cant so i just need to accept my reality.\n\nSorry for my bad english and sorry for writing this so long and thanks for reading if you have some advice that you can give me i appreciate, i hope u guys get a nice day and i hope your life is doing well.",

        "text": " You aren’t burning out because you’re working too hard, you’re burning out for 2 main reasons, which is what this guide will be about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. You’re not doing what you love and \n2. You're not taking care of your brain.\n\nThat’s it. So, if you can figure out what you love and do that, while also taking care of your brain –– I don’t care how many hours you work –– you won’t burnout.  \n \n\nAnd how do I know this is true? It’s because lived it. I know what it’s like to burn out over and over and over again and have no clue why. Years ago I was convinced I’d be a day trader and make millions of dollars. I wasn’t getting into trading because I loved it (my first mistake), I was getting into it because I wanted a lotta money. And then, I dove deep into trading without ever considering my brain (second mistake).\n\nWhat this looked like was, from the minute I woke up until I went to sleep, I forced myself to live and breathe the markets. And I say forced because it was NOT fun. But I wanted money so… \n\nI spent all day staring at screens, learning candlestick patterns, attending boring webinars, taking notes –– you get the picture. But while I was doing al of that, I was also eating like crap, I barely went outside to get some sunlight, didn’t exercise, took no breaks, got little sleep… I was beating the mess outta my brain. And I was doing it with something I didn’t even love!\n\nIs it ay wonder why it got tired of the beating and sent burnout to knock me down? I don’t think so.\n\nI was watching some interview by Steve Jobs and he was talking about all the long hours he was putting in. This dude would legit be coding, pass out in the middle of a sequence, wake up and get right back to it. The reporter asked if he ever worried about burning out and he said with full confident, the thought never crossed his mind. My guess is, the thought never crossed his mind because he was doing something he loved. \n\nIf you want a surefire way to never burnout, do what you love. Yes, taking care of your brain is important and it’s something I highly recommend. But we all know people with terrible health habits who do great work 24/7 without ever burning out. And how don’t they?  \n \n\nSimple.\n\nThey’re doing what they love. \n\nI can say with 100% confidence, that even if I was taking care of my brain (which we’ll talk about later), trading still would’ve burned me out because I didn’t love it. And if you’re here trying to learn how to prevent burnout, chances are, you’re just committed to the wrong thing.\n\nIf past Faith teleported to see me now and saw the hours –– and I mean HOURS –– of work I put in today, she’d be shook. Especially if I told her I’d been doing this for almost a year now without any signs of slowing down. If anything, I feel rejuvenated and ready for more every day. \n\nPast Faith couldn’t even go 3 months straight without losing her focus and burning out, but things have changed. Drastically. You need to do what you love. Don’t give your energy to something just for external reward. Make the reward doing the thing itself and you’ll find your chances of burning out practically nonexistent. But if you really wanna dive the nail into the coffin of burnout, take care of your brain.\n\nThis means eating healthy foods, getting your 7-8 hours of sleep, exercising, getting sunlight and fresh air, meditating, getting off social media, staying engaged and active in the world, spending quality time with quality people. There are so many ways to take care of your brain, but most people do the exact opposite.\n\nThey seek out all the ways to beat the heck out of their brain. They eat horrible processed foods, sleep deprive themselves, never workout, barely leave the house, stay glued to their phone screens or TV, never pause to take a moment to just slo down and be present and o much more.\n\nAnd if you fall into this group of people, then no wonder you keep burning out. \n\nYou do know it takes a lot of brainpower to sit and grind towards your goals and the life you want. So why do you skip out on the “giving your brain the power it needs” part? Back when I was learning how to trade, I wasn’t considering how hard I was working my brain. But to focus o na screen, especially when I didn’t really care for it, for hours on end was insanely mentally demanding.\n\nI was overworking and draining my brain without ever taking a step back to recharge it. And once my brain got down to 0%, it died and burnout took over. \n\nLook, if you’re an ambitious person with goals 10x larger than you, you have got to change your lifestyle. You can’t do what average people do and expect successful results. No, you have to do what successful people do for success and one of the biggest things they do is take care of their brain. \n\nI don’t have to tell you what to stop doing and what to start doing, it’s pretty common sense. We all know it’s better to eat the apple over the chocolate and to go for a walk rather than lay on the couch watching TV. I want you to think about all the things you’re doing right now that doesn’t help your brain out and go two weeks without doing them.\n\nJust two weeks.\n\nI promise you’ll feel a difference. Now, think about all the things you know is good for you and. your brain and commit to doing them during that time. Heck, make al list of brain do’s and don’ts if you have to. \n\nBefore I realized how important a well taken cared of brain is, I had so many bad habits that added up to burn me out. My brain couldn’t handle putting in hours of hard focused work without getting the maintenance it needed. After I woke up and realized I needed to focus on my brain’s health, everything changed. \n\nIt wasn’t an overnight transformation, it was a process of weening off processed foods for whole foods, replacing my phone for a book, and working out instead of living on the couch. But I stuck with the process and noticed how much my wellbeing and mental health improved. How more focused and productive I became and how I could do and sustain a lot more without even feeling the tinge of burnout. My energy levels went through the roof and things low-key felt easier.\n\nNow, I spend as much time as I can working on my goals without the slightest risk of burning out. And some people may think this sounds like an awful way to live. Like, why do I spend the majority of my time working?\n\nIt’s because first, it isn’t even work to me. Everything I’m doing, I genuinely love to do. And secondly, I’ve tasted the alternative of just living life consumed by entertainment and easy living.\n\nAnd that life made me depressed. I wasn’t put here to take things easy and follow the conventional route and if you’re here, you aren’t either. We were put here to set challenging goals that require more than we have to give. We were put here to grow and become much more than we are now.\n\nI’ve said before, you don’t have to work crazy hard like David Goggins or put in 60+ work week hours like Elon Musk. My goal will never be to promote hustle culture. It’s just that I, personally, love the idea of hard long work, and if you’re still here, I’m guessing so do you.\n\nSo the very worst thing for people like us to do is burnout and feel completely unable to do our work. Fortunately, your days of burnout are in the past and your days of sustained hard work and progress are front and center.\n\nAll you’ve gotta do is what you love and take of your brain in the process. It’s as simple as that to prevent burnout.\n\nNow remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action, working on your goals, right now.",

I study and read a lot in general but again it's just part of my routine now.

It is especially challenging if she is super attractive as I always get in my mind things like “nahh she gets too many approaches, I am not good enough to keep her attention, blah blah, she is too attractive…”\n\nAnyways. I was in the gym and tbh it is not the best place for approaching but this girl was SO CUTE I just had to do it. She came to me asking if the machine I was close to was free and at first I just said: “yes”.\n\nI knew it was just gym kind of question and not any “I want to talk to you” thing.\n\nAs I finished my set I was like: what do I tell, should I ask for a spot or this or that fuck.\n\nAnd I said it: fuck it, I am going to be honest and open and go there and just tell her she is cute.\n\nAnd I did. I walked to her and told her: “hey, this is a little bit random, but I just wanted to let you know that I think you are cute”.\n\n- akward moment of silence -\n\nAnd she was like: umm uuhh …\n\nAnd I was like: “okay, thats it, take it as a compliment, nothing else”\n\nAnd she said: “oh thank you, I am just not used to hear this haha”\n\nWe were both super confused but it was also kind of cute thing.\n\nAnyways, I asked her her age (just to confirm she is over 18 since it is 16+ gym) and she asked me my name. After that, I asked if she is single and she said that “she has a situationship” and refused to give me her instagram out of respect for that guy. I told her I understand and wish her great day and that if things come to the end with her man that she can come and let me know. She smiled and said sure and wished me great day.\n\n\n\nNow I am aware I got rejected. But I felt amazing. I did the most bald cold approach ever. And actually it played quite well! She was polite, she even seemed interested, and seemed happy to hear the compliment. She also showed respect for her man and I think that is amazing from her side. We both moved on, she knows I find her cute, I know she is not single and thats it!",

        "text": "* Turned 30 a few months ago\n* No friends for 16 years\n* Technically never had a girlfriend\n* Uneducated - Tried university (once) then community college (twice) didn't work out\n* Watch a lot of Twitch and read Reddit for my social fulfillment my entire adult life\n* Played games all day every day for 16 years straight, made zero friends online \n   * Talked to people online but ultimately I pushed them away every time I got invited to a lobby/group always had an excuse to say no, generally didn't enjoy other people's company and preferred being by myself\n* Live with 60 year old aging mother and her bf\n* Live in a rural area with small population (province has population of 160k - easy to figure which one in Canada)\n* Can't drive, don't want to drive\n* Never been to a dentist and have at least 6 different cavities and probably gum disease, tooth decay, and for some reason still have all of my teeth and almost never get any tooth aches maybe once or twice a year at most\n* Only worked on a farm because of my mother, as a farm laborer\n* 5\"8 173 lbs (overweight). July 2022 I was 190 lbs\n* Bought a TPE sex doll when I was 26 that weighs about 90 lbs and is 170 cm tall\n   * Mainly just nice to have it in bed beside me while I sleep and listen to ASMR - yes I have it at my mothers house in my room\n   * yes she knows about it\n* Failed grade 11 once and grade 12 twice because I was never at school (I hid at home in a closet full of junk where I can't even move for 8 hours some times. Other times I was in the apartment furnace room I sleep there when I was 14-15 years old sometimes lock the door from the inside - during school hours. If I go to school I hide on school grounds. Played a lot of video games to cope, still do/did.\n   * Interesting to note I actually love learning in school I just don't feel comfortable being around people so I run from them when I had the chance (which was all the time).\n      * Did the same thing in Uni and community college once I understood I didn't fit in with anyone there\n   * Had my first room when I was 19 years old - Slept on couch in living room entire 19 years before that and I mean a couch, no pull out bed until maybe 12 years old but by then I didn't like it and opted to just sleep on couch instead because it was familiar and I liked it better\n   * Some days when I was 13-15 I would just eat packets of sugar for the day that you use for tea or coffee. High-school was nice because I had some food in morning for free when I was there\n   * Vividly remember when I was in grade 7 one of my friends made a comment saying they only liked me because of the video games I had at my house, the other one told him to shut up. Never forgot that\n* Attempted suicide multiple times when I was 15-19 (haven't since then)\n   * Only alive because acquaintance in high school found me in library and teachers took me to hospital\n   * Spent a month in hospital while I was being evaluated they gave me multivitamins after that time and sent me on my way. When it was my 19th birthday staff brought me birthday cake, (nobody else did) when I got admitted. Had a conversation with the Harvard Dr. afterwards and she was really nice and will never forget her.\n* Don't do recreational drugs, don't drink alcohol - logically it's a waste of money and I only ever heard bad things about both so made no sense for me to even try\n* I'm mixed - mother is black, father is white parents divorced mother cheated on father and didn't like him anymore before I was born. Mother raised me by herself and 2 other siblings 6, 13 years apart in age, I'm the youngest, we each have a different father.\n* I don't know my father, and thought my sisters father was my father until only a few months ago\n* The person I thought was my father he is almost 75 years old and diabetic and is dying.  Haven't seen him for at least 5-8 years \n* Was the only person with different skin color in entire elementary, middle-school and in high-school there was I think 2 other people out of \\~1000 other people that had similar skin color to me (people treated me differently)\n* Family is poor growing up, still poor but somehow managed to save up money and buy everything that I have ever wanted (I hardly want anything), doesn't make sense but money isn't an issue for me if I want something I buy it (probably because my bills are very limited)\n* No/little life experiences for someone of my age\n* Never left my house this entire year so far (can't drive anyway) and I'm in a rural area\n* Last year only left house to go to work in the fields been like that pretty much my entire adult life\n   * I think I can confidently say I went into a store probably less than 100 times in the last 10 years\n* Last time I was in a grocery store was when I was 27 years old\n* Haven't talked to someone my age since community college which was when I was 23-24 then second time when I was 26-27\n* I never had a conversation with a person in real life this entire year\n* I haven't felt alone in years ironically probably around the time I bought the sex doll and sleep beside it in bed so it feels like someone is beside me I guess? Not sure on that one chief. \n* I admitted myself to the hospital after walking an hour from home at midnight because I was assaulted by my mother's bf  in 2020 after he put me in a chokehold and dug his nails into my neck and shoulder.  After, walking down to a precinct and asking police officers what to do (at midnight), I told them I had suicidal thoughts.\n* None of them knew what to do, they just asked me if my ipad was recording then checked if I had any weapons on me. They gave me a piece of paper with hotline on it and offered me food and water, I declined.  I said I didn't want to press charges just didn't know what to do. So I helped them and asked them if they could take me to a hospital in town, and so they drove me for about 30 minutes to the hospital in town.\n* In the hospital the psychiatrist on staff and a few nurses talked to me in the morning. After the evaluation the psychiatrist mentioned that I might be autistic and I should get adult testing for autism for 2k-3k. My guess would probably be Asperger's but I can't self diagnose so really that means nothing. Never got tested.\n*  Psychiatrist recommended that I try online learning instead because every time I explained I try to learn at a school I feel distracted by social situations and eventually stop coming to school because I never fit in with anyone. \n* My teachers were nice and I talked with them and they all said the programming work I was doing was fine I told them I'd like to exit the program and come back another time.  They tried to get me to stay, I just told them it was video game addiction as the reason to why I wasn't coming in to class as it was easier to explain.\n   *  I also talked to school counselors when I was in community college and they had no idea what they were doing.  Felt like I went there told them went was going on they didn' t know what to do so I just outlined a plan myself then told them what I should do.\n\nThis post is way too long so I'll just talk about what I've been doing to improve myself.\n\n* I have a spreadsheet where I keep track of my sleeping patterns, weight with a graph to see changes over time, hygiene (shower, oral hygiene), diet (every item and every thing I drink I write down on my spreadsheet), study, daily diary.\n* Software ideas, \"bucket list\", learning resources, reading material\n* I have played every video game that I have ever wanted to play\n* I have watched every anime, show and movie I was interested in\n* Now I had nothing left to do so I divert that energy to self improvement because it sounds fun\n\nI recently started exercising every morning at first I started with 10 pushups, 10 sit-ups, 10 jumping jacks, 10 squats, and run in place for a few minutes, I increase the amount by 1 daily.  Currently up to 21 and since my sleep schedule is messed up because I couldn't stop thinking and writing this I have to do a set of 22 in 2  more hours and stay up the rest of the day to fix my sleep schedule.\n\n* I set up dental appointment few months ago and will have my evaluation at the end of next month, actually excited and expect to pay thousands of dollars but it's worth it and I don't know what else I would spend my money on anyway. Figured spending it on self improvement sounds logical\n* Been doing self study to become a Web Developer (programmer) by following the The Odin Project (TOP).\n* That energy is now diverted to programming (what I was in school for I always loved programming)\n* I started  that self taught course January 20th, 2023 took one day off (today) since and am currently at the end of the foundations course then from there I do full stack JavaScript course.\n   * Plan is to finish this course within 2 months apply to some jobs and see what happens\n   * If I don't find a job I will continue to search for a job then go and complete my last year of community college for programming (online instead) then get a job through that instead.\n* Goal is now to get down to 160 lbs from 173 lbs\n\nNot sure why I am happy but at least for now I'm hopeful for the future, maybe things will work out if I put some effort into it, maybe not.  But for now I'm glad that I at least have a direction and even if nobody looks at this thread at least I was able to put everything into perspective by writing this.",

It was a month and so and I heard she cried over me and such and quote her saying “I get high and think of you” (said on her Twitter journal page) and “I miss you” (heard from other friends) which kinda made me think why is she still hooked on me. It was a talking stage! I blocked her on all platforms because she was a problem (caused problems with friends and overall a person I didn’t like)\n\n1 month later and some change  (a week or so ago) I stumbled across her Twitter page curiosity killed the cat and I scrolled down to her saying stuff like “if only they knew what he said” and “if only I could say what I knew” around the time I started blocking her.\n\nSince then since I saw the tweet (1 week or so) I have been going crazy thinking about this. Overthinking! It started at her exposing my kink and me overthinking that though if it would have happened it would’ve happened already (it didn’t happen) Now I am in a home school esk program and don’t have to worry about my reputation anymore but my brain is still overthinking for some reason about the most minute details and it’s starting to drive me crazy and I think I’m on late stage overthinking because know I’m thinking about/ getting mad about thinking about this so long even after knowing it wasn’t a big deal and hearing it from friends who gave me advice. It’s kinda bipolar too because sometimes I’m like “it’s high school! No big deal” and then sometimes I’ll be in my head thinking about that mistake I made and small things like music I heard around the time I was talking to her and walking past her place of work kinda trigger me of thinking about it again. \nI just need some improvement tips and help thanks all!\n\nNow: it got worse, but I feel it possible for it to get better. The past few days I’ve been alone with my thoughts and my brain will now not allow me to see myself being on FaceTime with another woman or falling asleep on FaceTime with another woman. I feel like this is all happening because this is the first ever woman to show me affection and me getting\n“intimate” with. Getting that ghost memory syndrome hard hard. Will it get any better?

        "text": "\nI grew up extremely poor but I was always really good at math.\n\nIn middle school, I read a lot of books by Stephen Hawking/Lisa Randall/Brian Greene and dreamed about being a theoretical particle physicist.\n\nThis led to me casually self-studying calculus in 8th grade so I can understand the physics. I took the AP calculus exam and got a 5.\n\nIn high school, I ended up getting into this dual-enrollment program at a local community college and exhausted all of their math within 3 semesters (Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra). \n\nThen I did another two years of dual-enrollment at University of Maryland - College Park taking upper level math classes (Intro. to Proofs, Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis, etc.)\n\nHowever, I was extremely neglected by my parents and they were never home (my stepdad was physically abusive and my mom was constantly cheating on him or lived out of her car) and barely gave me enough money to buy food much less drive me anywhere so I had to take 2-3 buses to get to the school and it was in Maryland so during the winter I’d be freezing my ass off waiting outside at the bus stops.\n\nMy schedule was like wake up around 6am and take 2 buses to get to high school and then take 2-3 buses to attend my community college classes at night and then take 2-3 buses to get back home around 10pm. I probably wasted 4-5 hours waiting for the bus / riding the bus (3-4 days a week).\n\nAnyway my point is, I started hating math and constantly had suicidal thoughts during my commute.\n\nBy the third year of this, I decided I was going to either graduate early or kill myself.\n\nI took English 11 during the summer school (which I had to walk 5 miles to get to because my parents wouldn’t drive me) and I graduated when I was 16 and got into a top science/engineeering college.\n\nFinally, I was leaving my toxic family and I thought I had solved all my problems.\n\nHowever, being 16 I was super socially awkward and I was mostly taking graduate math classes with people a lot older (24-30) and never really felt like I belonged.\n\nI started studying pure math 6-10 hours a day and I started really hating math. I was getting good grades but it felt more like huge amounts of memorization of several-page proofs instead of any actual understanding.\nAt that level, the math was no longer trivial computations but rather long-ass proofs where you had to remember some “novel idea” that would be impossible to come up with on your own during a 1 hour exam.\n\nOn top of this, I was working a couple jobs because I didn’t have any money for food/hanging out/clothes.\n\nAnyway, this lack of money made me so angry, I started looking into penny stocks.\n\nI had just learned what a Roth IRA was so I had maxed out my first year (around $6k) after contributing every month for a year and a half. At first, I was in S&amp;P index funds (VOO) but I grew angry at the lack of progress I threw my whole account balance into a random animal health care company called Zomedica ($ZOM). It was trading 10 cents and it ran up to over $2 after someone posted a viral Cameo video of Netflix's “Tiger King” star Carole Baskin commenting on the stock.\n\nAnyway, I ended up staring at $81k sitting in my Roth IRA at age 18. But to me at the time, I was in such a depressed, suicidal haze I immediately gambled to entire balance on another penny stock called Bionano Genomics ($BNGO). I doubled my money and I had around $160,000.\n\nThen I got sucked into SPACs, I saw a reddit post or tweet about a increase in google search results for “Lucid Motors” in Saudi Arabia and it started a rumor that they were going to go public via SPAC. One of the only SPACs that was big enough to fund this transaction was CCIV. I gambed my entire account balance and the $160k turned into $1.1 million.\n\nLong story short, after these successful trades, I was convinced SPACs were free money. I bought shares, warrants, and options in every large SPAC (PSTH, IPOF, IPOD, GHIV, etc). And it all tanked. The lower the price went the more I doubled down.\n\nAnyway, I eventually cut my losses and had around $20k left.\n\nTechnically, I was still positive since I started\nwith only $6k but I lost all sense of money. Seeing my account go up and down $15k in the first few seconds of market open has made me completely out of touch with reality.\n\nAnd knowing that hedge funds and rich finance people basically automate this shit with machine learning, sentiment analysis, immediate scraping of news, etc.\n\nThey don’t produce any goods, provide any services, or generate anything of value. They just move numbers on a computer screen.\n\nI dropped out of a PhD program for pure math to do a software engineering so that I can have more disposable income to trade stocks and options.\n\nI don’t give a fuck about software engineering or the products I work on and I hate all my coworkers.\n\nDuring work, I spend the first half just looking at stock screeners, unusual volume stocks/options, news websites, earnings, reddit, etc.\n\n**I barely get anything done because I can barely justify clocking into work since I could be making or losing a whole year’s salary in 15 minutes. The idea of a job doesn’t make any sense to me seeing the inflation numbers / rising cost of living and the fact that wages haven’t kept up.\n\nI feel like I wasted my potential and wasted my life just obsessing over stocks and options. I’m so depressed that I hate my job, I quit my hobbies, pushed away all my close friends and family. I wish I was still in academia but it feels too late now.\n\nI probably have severe depression and a gambling addiction but I’m making more money on options than my job so it’s hard to convince myself to stop.**\n\nI made 5-6 figures (per trade) trading cruiselines / airlines during the pandemic, oil / fertilizer options when when I read Russia was lining up troops on the border, shorting Trump’s stupid social media company “Truth Social” after a major run up and most recently trading puts/calls on Tesla. I’m a very event-driven trader and all my trades are based on common sense and public news that have been out for hours/days. \n\nI’m a very event-driven trader and all my trades are based on common sense and public news that have been out for hours/days.\n\nMy risk tolerance is extremely high. For example, I converted my entire retirement account to $QQQ/$AAPL following the recent Big Tech crash, put around ~$50k in crypto (BTC/ETH/LINK) after reading about the FTX/Alameda collapse.",

        "text": "I’m 24m and I haven’t been on a date in over a year. I haven’t been laid in almost three years (March 2020, my last semester of college). College was the only time of my life I had regular success with women. I went to an all-boys catholic high school. To sum up - there are factors outside my direct control that influenced this development.\n\nI had a college girlfriend that ended up actually not being so serious though I thought she was at the time. I took it hard, and gradually spent more and more time focusing on what I did wrong. I was too insecure. I was too controlling. I didn’t appreciate who she really was. I remembered instances where I was a bad boyfriend and played them over in my head, over and over and over.\n\nI got on the dating apps around summer 2021. I had gotten fat as hell relative to college but I was still able to get dates with a few relationship material women. Three separate occasions we got two dates, had the first kiss, we’re planning the third and I freak out. I am by this point convinced there’s a reason she doesn’t like me. Two didn’t respond to messages for a day and I accused them of ghosting me and they got mad, the third got a bit upset at me for something else and I ghosted her. Real self sabotaging bullshit.\n\nA year ago I decided I did not need a relationship. I fully bought into the idea that real progress is made while single. I got into the best shape I’ve ever been in and thought I was doing great. My main thing has always been face and height, but my confidence in the overall physical element is greatly increased.\n\nHowever, I feel like I’m just spinning my wheels on the other stuff. The stuff that actually made me a bad boyfriend in the first place. I flirt and lead girls on because it’s fun but I am allergic to the idea of a date right now. I haven’t asked a few that I know would have said yes, I have turned a couple that asked down. Honestly I feel like I’m doing them a favor. They would come to regret dating a loser like me anyway. I haven’t changed any of the fundamental flaws in my character and I’m honestly unsure how I could.\n\nToday I decided to give some time to the opposing view. I’m not undatable, and I should try building a relationship with one of these women. I’m flawed, she’s flawed, it’s okay we’ll figure it out. I know men who are bad boyfriends, bad husbands at times but they’ve been able to keep their woman seemingly happy, or at least committed. I shouldn’t assume they’ll judge me so much more harshly. I want to improve myself, and I remember being a better person than I am now when I was in a relationship. Quality relationships are what keeps us healthy, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIdk, not sure how all this should sit in my head, just thinking at some point I have to give up on trying to be perfect and settle for being normal. Hard to tell when that point is.",
