        "text": "Hello from the other siiiide! I post a lot on /r/TalesFromYourServer because I see a lot more noteworthy customers than I am a customer...but occasionally...\n\n\nThere was a little old lady in line next to me at the fast food chain I go to for super cheap (in my city) iced coffee. She was trying to buy a breakfast sandwich or something inexpensive. \n\n\nHer debit card was being declined. She was obviously ESL and having difficulty understanding. The teenaged cashier chose to handle this by telling her loudly and obnoxiously \"YOU HAVE NO MONEY\" while slumping over his register, rolling his eyes and giving his fellow cashiers an exasperated, overdramatic \"can you believe this??\" look.\n\n\nAfter watching this go on for about a minute, I paid for her freaking food just to get the cashier to stop acting like doing his job and handling non-English speaking customers in a culturally diverse city like Manhattan is some huge imposition.\n\nI know what it's like to work long hours in a less-than-comfortable work environment. And I used to work in a hotel and had to deal with customers who don't speak English well all the time--I sympathize with the frustration of a language barrier but IT'S YOUR JOB to treat people decently and with respect, not deliberately try to humiliate them. I have secondhand embarrassment for this little shit as a fellow serviceperson, and in my eyes he reflects poorly on everyone in this industry. \n\n\nWhen the cashier told her that I paid for her food she smiled at me and said \"Thank you ma'am!\" which almost made me feel worse. Her order cost less than $5, it was nothing to me, and she looked so happy over something so little.\n\n\nI hope this kid grows up. I feel like his poor attitude is emblematic towards his general outlook on life--treating people who he considers \"less\" (whether due to skin colour or language barrier or social class) poorly because they don't deserve to be treated with respect. It is basically the same mentality as the terrible customers who treat service people poorly because they think their server is beneath them.",

My hands were greasy so I asked my kid to sit with my purse and phone, but she followed me.\n\n\nI took about a minute to wash my hands and went back to where I was sitting, and another lady was in my place and someone had moved my things to somewhere else, in front of the shop window.\n\n\nFinished our manicures and paid with cash.

Few weeks into my classes get dropped due to \"non-payment\". Prepaid provider says they were never invoiced. It took several phone calls but it's all good now, hopefully. But here is one how of the calls started:\n\n&gt;**Lady**: Hello thank you for calling, how may I help you?\n\n&gt;**Me**:  *(explaining how I registered for classes, giving my info to verify my identity)* My classes were dropped due to non payment. (I either paused here to see if she was following so far or paused for a breath as the explanation took a bit)\n\n&gt;**Lady**: *(pulling my records up)* Well it looks here you rejected your student loans. You need something to pay for your classes.\n\n&gt;**Me**: *(in my head: you think I signed up for a class for the heck of it?)* Oh no I have a prepaid plan.\n\n&gt;**Lady**: oh.\n\nMind you, every other person who had previously picked the phone on the support line had gone directly to my financial history to see what was wrong. This lady went straight to my loans, assuming that's how I wanted to pay. She also seemed very reluctant to put in the effort to look for evidence about what happened in other areas of the system. I know they don't give the phone reps access to much but she seemed reluctant to even try. I'm thinking: lady, I know most people take out loans but still the most logical place to check it the billing history. I'm not stupid, I know you have to pay for college (side note: not trying to start a political debate here) so if I'm calling there is something else I do not understand not that.\n\nTo end on a happy note: I go to campus (where they can better help me), and find out that a higher up in registration somehow got a whiff of this and added me back to my classes. I had made a lot of phone calls but really one one of them ended up in a ticket being created (as I didn't really need a ticket). I was told though the ticket would take a few days. I was added the same day. I don't know how it happened but I am thankful. And I got to talk to a very helpful information desk representative who's first name happens to be my last name (he's helped us a few times). He assured me that it's all good and they will work out the payment issues without my classes being dropped. So a great resolution, but a very long process.",

I had previously been into the store due to not seeing a discount on my bill (that was there, just marked as a form of payment, not showing on the bill). PhoneGuy who helped us was pleasant and patient even though he wasn't making a sale. \n\nWe go in to change the plan, increase data, and add the phone. We ask for PhoneGuy who helped us previously, so he could make some commission. He had just left on his break, and we had errands to run so decided to wait. \n\nWe come back, he's there and starts working on changing things. Long story (although this kind of is long already!) and the system to port the number from the old provider is down. Hour of our day lost (with a fussy year old baby in tow) but not his fault. He was pleasant and fantastic with our daughter, so we decide to come back when he's working the next day - trying to get him that commission for his hard work and patience. \n\nHere's where the unpleasant children come in. We're mildly frustrated due to the technical issues and the wait, but this isn't PhoneGuy's fault. When we go in the next day (Saturday) during his shift. Store is busy, college sports game on the TV, things are crazy, but PhoneGuy is ready for us. We sit down to get it done (hoping the system is back up!) and two children (approximately 2 and 5) are running around the store, pulling items off low shelves.  The woman watching them (mom?) keeps telling the 5 year old to watch the 2 year old, the turns around and ignores them - therefore they continue to run wild. Staff appear to be glaring at the children but not doing anything. Kids seem to be having the time of their life. \n\nI work with disruptive children on a regular basis. I love what I do, but get so frustrated when parents don't parent. She simply ignored them! \n\nThankfully they leave, PhoneGuy gets us set up, and we get to leave. Through all the stress and issues, he was competent and pleasant, making our visit much easier and smoother than it could've been. \n\nSo props to PhoneGuy for the amazing service, and tsk tsk to the mom for not parenting. The story has such polar opposite parts, and I'm still frustrated by this mom, I had to share. \n\nTL:DR - PhoneGuy gives amazing customer service with technical difficulties and parent refuses to parent.

It has become a family habit that whenever my husband and I come down we try to get together somewhere with both his parents and my parents, usually at a restaurant about halfway between the two.\n\nThis was a long weekend a few years ago, some Memorial Day or Labor Day, and it turned out to be unexpectedly cold.  This had the effect of sending tons of people inside from their barbecues and into restaurants, so this one particular weekend the restaurant we had agreed to meet at was *packed*.  It was so stuffed that there was barely any room to stand inside while waiting for a table, and it was so chilly outside that we didn't want to wait there, either.\n\nIt was a bit of a wait, but we didn't have much of a choice (literally every restaurant in town was like this) so we stuck through it.  We were finally seated and as our waiter took our drink orders he told us that it might be a while before he got back to us because table X still needed to get their drinks and he needed to take table Y's order, etc.  We told him we understood, and to take his time.  We weren't there for the food, but for each other's company, so once we were seated and warm where we could chat, we were happy as clams.\n\nWe talked and joked with each other while we got our drinks and eventually our food.  The waiter was early twenties (maybe even late teens), pretty good-natured, and kept apologizing for everything.  When we got our food he said he was sorry for the wait.  We hadn't even noticed, and we told him so.  It actually seemed pretty fast, to me.  At one point he told us it was only his first week on the job.  Both my dad and my father-in-law are jokesters, and they were both making good-natured jokes with the waiter each time he checked on us.  (Short jokes, really just funny responses to his questions - we knew he was a busy guy and weren't wasting his time.)  \n\nWhen it finally came time for the check the waiter told us with that same smile he'd had all evening, \"Have a good evening folks!  You were my best table all night!\"  My dad responded jokingly, \"Yeah, huh? We heard you say that to the last table!\"  The waiter's facade cracked for a moment and it looked all of a sudden like he was going to cry.  He said, \"No, I'm serious.  You guys are the only people who even smiled at me all night.\"  He quickly regained his composure and left to handle his other tables.\n\nWe felt so bad for the kid.  We all unanimously agreed to leave him a huge tip (and we were already a large party who'd ordered appetizers and drinks, and who regularly tips 20% unless something went very wrong) in the hopes that it would help him make it through the rest of the tough night.  That's gotta be rough to go through something like that your first week.  None of us could understand why you'd be so hard on your waiter when it was obviously busier than heck.  It's not his fault it was in the 40s (F) on a day most people expected to have a picnic.  Being upset ain't gonna make the steaks cook faster or put more chairs in the building.\n\nLife is short.  Be somebody else's glimmer of hope on a dark day.",

One is literally less than a mile away down the same street, and one is a mile and a half away up the same street (in another direction).\n\nThe human race is doomed, I tell ya.",

But, while they all knew who I was, they didn't know me.\n\nThe biggest store in that small town was a national dollar store chain. It had been recently built and was a big deal. Everybody shopped there because it meant nobody had to drive 35-40 minutes to go to the big box store just to pick up toilet paper or a light bulb. \n\nEvery time I went to that store, without fail, the manager would follow me. It didn't matter if there was somebody who was actively stealing - if I was there, I was obviously up to no good. I've never actually stolen from a store (unless you count once when I was 6 and stole a pack of gum from the grocery store) and I didn't plan to start then. \n\nI went to the store one May morning to look for a birthday gift for my daughter. My friend went to the store with me and noticed that the manager was following me. He asked me why and I was like, \"Oh, he thinks I'm gonna steal something and he wants to catch me\".\n\nFriend: \"What?!? Are you serious? How long has hew been doing this?\"\nMe: \"Ever since they opened\"\nFriend: \"Why don't you say something?\"\nMe: \"He doesn't think I know that he's following me. He always stays far enough back that he could be doing something else, but he's always near where I am. Who would I complain to? He's the store manager.\nBesides, I'm used to it.\"\n\nMy friend is justifiably offended on my behalf, but i5 tell him to just ignore it. We continue to walk around the store and we get to the small toy section. I saw they had the new Barbie \"Flava\" dolls. I looked for one my daughter would like and noticed that the manager was practically in front of us the next aisle over. \n\nI decided to take advantage of the fact that he was so close and I VERY loudly exclaimed, \"Look at these Barbies! All they ever have are the white Barbies! Don't they ever think that white people aren't the only people who shop here!\"\nI look at my friend and say, \"Let's go. It looks like I'll have to go to the big box store to get a gift for Daughter.\" \n\nMY friend was mortified (he hates scenes) and eager to leave.\nI went back to the store with my friend a week later because I needed to get some random things for the house and we went through the toy section. I looked and saw that they'd gotten new \"Flava\" dolls: the Puerto Rican doll. I pointed out to him. \n\nWe both had a good laugh and Daughter got a new Barbie that actually looked like her.",

        "text": "This happened yesterday to my husband. So my husband decides he wants new jeans, and drives about 45 minutes to the nearest high end mall clothing store he likes. He finds a pair, but they only have the jeans he wants in long, and he needs regular. Lucky for us, they offer free alterations and offer to hem them for him, and we happily agree. \n\nLast night he decides to drive over after work and pick them up. He comes home very late but is excited to show them to me. He takes the pants out of the bag, and looks up at me shocked. There is a massive rip (maybe 8 inches) across the back of the pants. They are also the wrong size, and very clearly used. These are NOT the pants he bought. So I call the store to figure out what happened. \n\nThe assistant manager remembers my husband, but says he cannot find his pants anywhere and has no idea what happened. Finally I offer to send him a picture of the pants we received so he can figure out what happened (and confirm we are not just making this up) and he says he doesn't need a picture. He knows exactly which pants we have. They belong to another customer who brought them in to be repaired. Eventually he finds my husbands pants back on the sales floor. He blames what happened on having new staff members, and offers to mail us our pants and a return label for the wrong ones. At the end of the call he says if we come back and ask for him he will \"give us a discount\" on something else, and then he meekly added.. \"just please please send those other pants back as fast as you can\". \n\nI feel really bad for the other customer, they are not going to have the pants repaired on time, and another less caring person could have just thrown them away.

In our library we have a little cafe that serves pastries, breakfast foods, and drinks that come from the big S brand coffee giant.\n\n\nI usually never go to the cafe because, honestly, it's not that great but I was super hungry and decided whatever, might as well. So, I order a bagel with butter, pay, and stand off to the side to wait for my order.\n\n\nThis guy behind me orders a bagel with butter AND cream cheese. Weird but okay. Both of us are waiting to the side for our orders when one of the cafe workers places a bagel on the counter and says \"bagel with cream cheese\".\n\n\nI don't touch the bagel because I didn't order a bagel with cream cheese, but butter and cream cheese guy decides to snag it and walk away from the counter. A few seconds later cafe worker is back and announces she has a butter and cream cheese bagel ready. I realize that the cream cheese bagel was made for me, and so I tell the cafe worker that I didn't receive my order of a bagel with butter.\n\n\nNow, the cafe worker on the register and the cafe worker making the bagels gang up on me. They both start saying how butter and cream cheese boy took my bagel and I should've been \"more aware\" because clearly it's MY fault this happened. I didn't respond and just went to wait again for my bagel. Register worker and bagel maker then proceed to audibly talk shit about how stupid I am and how I should've realized the cream cheese bagel that I didn't order was mine.\n\n\nI finally got my bagel after listening to their bitching for five minutes and promptly went home and wrote a complaint to the company that runs food services at my college. I'm still mad because I'm actually really nice to costumer service workers because I feel there pain, but their rudeness was uncalled for. Hopefully something is done about it.",

        "text": "So a few days ago my boyfriend and I were chilling at home and we both were pretty hungry. We're at the end of our bi-weekly paycheck so we're pretty broke and the only food in the house is ramen. So we decide to go to the local sub shop. We live right in town so there's one only a block away. \n\nWe head to it and notice 2 women storm out fairly angry. I didn't think too much of it as I work in retail and sometimes people just get mad over stupid shit. So we walk in and wait at the counter. So just to clear this up, this sub shop still had 2 hours until closing time. And there were 3 employees working, and it was completely dead. \n\nSo we walk up and this young girl, maybe 19 asks us what we want. My boyfriend orders a meatball marinara sub on asiago bread. Another young employee shows up and tells my boyfriend that they didn't have the meatballs or the bread. She proceeds to roll her eyes and sigh like we're making her life so difficult and says she could make them for us but we'd have to wait. \n\n I feel I should mention that behind the counter was an absolute mess. Like super bad. I've worked in a concession stand at a movie theater(different but still) and if we had it looking like this there'd be hell to pay. So my boyfriend takes a step back to see what they have and change his order after they made it super obvious how inconvenient we were being. So the first girl moves on to me and I had already taken stock of what they had so I ordered this seafood salad (local favorite) with Italian bread. Usually I go for flatbread but I saw they literally only had Italian. She goes to the bread thing and pulls out all 3 loaves of bread they had IN THE ENTIRE CABINET. And I can tell from where I'm standing that they're rock fucking hard. She throws them in the garbage and walks to the back.\n\nMy boyfriend and I stand there for a moment and wait but its pretty clear they aren't coming back anytime soon. We both decide to leave and go somewhere else. \n\nI know the food industry isn't easy but I've never seen a restaurant in such a pathetic state. It was like they spent their whole shift chatting and chilling instead of their job. Maybe the shift before them didn't prep but its no excuse. You don't treat customers like they're an inconvenience. I know I never would at my job. \n\nI dunno it really pissed me and my boyfriend off. ",

        "text": "While in a coffee shop, this evening, I was chewed out and kind of threatened by one of the servers, and all I did was ask for the donut that came with my meal.\n\nWhat happened is that I ordered a chipotle chicken wrap combo, which comes with a coffee, as well as a choice of a donut or potato wedges.  I specified how much cream &amp; sugar I wanted in my coffee, to which the cashier replied \"what size?\"  I told her I'll take the default size for that particular combo.  She said there isn't one, and that the price will change, reflecting the beverage size I choose.  So I told her I wanted whatever comes up to the advertised price, literallly pointing up to the menu item - it turned out to be a medium.  \n\nShe then asked if I wanted potato wedges.  I declined.  From there, she gave me the price of the order and I paid it.  \n\nAnd now I'll fast forward to the end of my meal.  I finished my wrap, and realized I didn't have a donut.  So I went to the cashier, told her what happened, and was given a Canadian Maple (my favorite.)\n\nFast forward again by a couple minutes: I'm halfway through my pastry when the cashier walks up to me and hands me a receipt for a wrap &amp; a coffee - seperate items, not the combo I ordered.  \n\nShe then informs me that I can have the donut for free,  but to be careful in the future, because the day-staff aren't as nice as she is.  \n\nI reminded her not only that I had ordered a combo, but also of the fact that I literally pointed to the menu while doing so.  But apparently it didn't matter.  \n\nHer side of the story is that when I declined the wedges, it meant that I no longer wanted a combo.  \n\nShe returned to her post.  I then calculated the total cost of the intended order, subtracting what I actually paid, and the difference was $0.68.  So I walked over to the cashier, gave her 3 quarters, and went home.  \n\nAfter being talked down to like that, as a result of their own mistake, I'm just going to go somewhere else for my coffee from now on.

        "text": "Last August, I was visiting my girlfriend and towards the end of my trip we decided to go to these semi-famous caves nearby. The group that owned the caves offered guided tours through them and so we bought two tickets and waited for our tour to start. We were told that tours normally run with about 15-20 people in each, which was no big deal.\n\n\nWe were greeted by this young, couldn’t have been more than 25 years old girl, who seemed genuinely excited to show us around. So my girlfriend and I exchange smiles, this was going to be fun. We both stayed right at the front of the group.  I like to ask the tour guide extra questions, and get first opportunities for photos without anyone else being in front of me.\nThe guide waits until everyone has made it to the first room, gives everyone a few seconds to look around and then starts speaking her piece. She is telling us about the history of the caves, how far below ground we were, why it was a constant 56F in there, etc., being a good guide. I hope I’m painting a good picture.\n\n\nAbout 5 minutes into the tour a small, two year old child starts crying, probably because he was cold. It’s quiet at first so our guide just keeps on, speaking a bit louder to get over the crying. But it doesn’t stop, even when the guide asks the kid to quiet down, he does for about 30 seconds then starts back up again. The guide now is losing her train of thought, and having to pause every so often and it’s really making it hard for her to say her piece about each chamber. This really wasn’t a place for a two year old.\n\n\nAfter another 5 minutes of this baby’s shrieking, the whole group is looking back, and getting a little disgruntled that this is happening, and seemingly the kid’s parents aren’t interested in trying to quiet him down. So the tour guide decides to say something and the following exchange occurs:\n\n\n&gt; $Guide: Excuse me sir, but would you mind trying to stop your child from crying, I’m not sure the people at the back can hear me over him.\n\n\n&gt; $KidDad: Uhh, no! He is two, and he’s holding the ticket so let’s go.\n\n\nThe guide now looks visibly shocked that someone would say that to her, and looks pretty shaken up. But on the tour goes, screaming kid and all. As we are walking to the next chamber, she says to us in a quiet voice:\n\n\n&gt; $Guide: Was I in the wrong there? Is that too much to ask?\n\n\n&gt; $Us: No not at all, that’s pretty reasonable and he was rude to you, and that kid is very loud.\n\n\n&gt; $Guide: Good, I’m sorry you have to listen to that.\n\n\n&gt; $Us: It’s not your fault, you are doing great! We are both having fun.\n\n\nWe make it back to one of the first rooms we visited, as we needed to cross it to get into the next wing. We pause while the guide tells us about some more history of the chamber but she can’t focus over the now blood curdling screams of this baby, he doesn’t want to be there, and we don’t want him there either. So finally, the guide asks the boy and his father to leave. There is another tour just getting started so our guide asks the guide for the second tour to watch us while she escorts this man out of the caves.\n\n\nWe hear all the way out this man screaming at our guide, telling her that she is in the wrong, and she can’t do this, and that he she was going to lose her job for this. This poor girl is going through hell. \n\nWhen she gets back 10 minutes later she tries to continue on but there are tears streaming down her face and she just can’t. She breaks down in front of all of us, saying that she has never had to kick someone out before, that she is scared she’ll lose her job for this, and all she wanted to do was make the kid quieten down. A few people approach her and give her a hug and we all thank her for doing that, because she truly made the right call. She managed to compose herself a few minutes later and we completed the tour, minus the screaming baby.\n\n\nWhen we make it back up to the gift shop, we find the guy that was kicked out had been calling the shop non-stop for the last 30 minutes, harassing the staff, and just being a jerk. Both of us put in a good word for the tour guide and gave her a nice tip. Apparently several other people had put in good words for her at the end too, so I hope she didn’t lose her job.\n",

I was a super broke part time student/ full time hotel employee, taking care of my girlfriend and her little brother (who'd been pretty much abandoned by their mother after a nasty divorce). \n\nI was worried about what to give the GF for V-day. I get a call one day from a much older family friend couple asking if I could help with some household chores. I cared very deeply for them so the first chance I got I went over and did what they needed. The next day the woman calls and asks if I can go over again. Before work I manage to find a little time and head that way. \n\nTurns out she had gone by one of my favorite restaurants and bought me gift tokens. Basically they are coins that have a set value (in this case $25 x 2 to equal $50) and spend just like cash. She told me to bring little brother over so she could watch him and take GF out for V-day. She knew I was broke. \n\nSo the big day comes. We go to the restaurant, have an awesome meal and an awesome time. Then the check comes...$27 and some change. I was like, I wont be able to find the time, baby-sitting, and money to come back. I'm just gonna give this girl a 90% tip, since I had got the hook up myself. So I place the two coins on the table. \n\nThe waitress comes, grabs the coins and says \"I'll be right back with your change.\" \n\nI said,  \"Oh no!  That is yours.\"\n\nTo which she replies \" Really!...I get to keep the whole $2 and something! Gee...thanks!\". \n\nI was super confused, but as soon as the gut punch subsided I waited for her to pass and said \"Actually, I will take my change. \"\n\nAfter a long wait she finally \"remembers\" I'm waiting and practically throws $2+ at me and runs off. I patiently wait for her to walk by again and say \"I don't believe I got all my change back.\"\n\nShe says, \"$27+ bill...$30 in coins leaves $2 and whatever.\"\n\nI say \"Umm...try looking at the denomination of those coins again.\"\n\nShe removes them from her apron pocket and goes white as a ghost, then red and then runs off. She thought I'd given her two $15 coins. \n\nSo I'm still there. She is clearly not sure how to handle the situation. Finally I'm like \"Are you gonna bring me the rest of my change?\". She very meekly brings over a $20 which I promptly put in my pocket, leaving her the $2+ tip after all. ",

One employee on the phone, and one employee at the counter dealing with a customer also at the counter.  The customer was *very* unhappy about the corporate warranty policy, and was going 'round and 'round with the (extremely-patient) employee about why he should get a free replacement battery.\n\nThis guy had bought one of their store-brand, 2-year warranty batteries.  This brand is infamous for being one that you WILL use their free replacement part warranty, because their parts are garbage.  This guy had bought a battery, and **shockingly** it failed.  They dutifully replaced the battery.  That one also failed.  Neither of these batteries lasted the expected 2 full years.  Each of them lasted more than one year.  Sooooo this guy had paid for a 2 year battery and got about a 3ish year battery.  The terms of the warranty say he had got his money's worth.  \n\nThe employee finally got through to this customer by saying something along the lines of \"okay look, let's say you bought a battery and it lasted a day short of 2 years.  We'd replace it.  Then you get another day-short-of 2 years out of the next one.  That's nearly 4 years on a 2 year battery, and the corporate line is that you've got your money's worth.\"\n\n**for perspective**\n\nI buy Optima red tops for double-ish what they charge for their store brand batteries, and the last one gave about a 7 year service life.  But hey okay you want to buy the cheap one, go ahead.\n\n**anyway**\n\nall that's just the introduction and background. The actual Tale is when I was walking out of the store (they didn't have the part I needed) and another customer walked in and said to the employee at the counter: \"I need a battery...\"\n\n&gt;Lather, rinse, repeat",

Given that I was on a sweet, sweet promotional plan, and the law here states that as long as you don't sign a new contract, your old rates stand.  I have just been buying new phones and activating them onto my old plan.   \n\nTwo weeks ago, I smashed my phone badly and needed a new phone.   I called customer support who informed me they could under no circumstances honor my old plan and when a new IMEI was activated onto the account it would be flagged for \"fraud\" and deactivated.\n\nI went to the store and they told me the same thing - new policy apparently to \"prevent the illegal trade of grandfathered plans\".\n\nNeedless to say, I went to a competitor who was offering aggressive rates and a free phone and signed on with them.\n\nToday I got my final bill, $380.   I could not view the list of charges (since my account is no longer valid) and I receive electronic bills.\n\nSo I called.   Apparently after 10 years, they are charging an \"early termination fee\", charging out the remainder of my handset subsidy (which I may add the first phone I obtained from them was a Blackberry Pearl, back in 2006) which I somehow owe $100 on.  I also have a $99 early termination fee.   \n\nI also regularly go over my data allowance since I pay only $5, gb.  However they charged out my overages during my final month at their per MB rate of $0.15/mb.  These are the overages prior to me terminating my service with them.\n\nNow I am somehow on the hook for $380 and the few people who I have spoken to have told me they are all legitimate charges.\n\nI have a copy of my original contract which states that the termination fee is valid during the first 3 years, as is the handset buy out, however it has been a decade.   Charging a different rate for overages prior to cancellation, while they don't cover that in the original contract, I can't imagine that being legal, anywhere.\n\nI have escalated but they subscribe to the customer service model of - you can't speak to a supervisor, they will call you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He even said he would be lenient on payments as long as we paid at least $100 a month even though he put us down as needing to pay $200 a month. He had even suggested that we not get the new vehicle because it would be too hard for us to pay bills. They even looked at our old vehicle to see if it would be more cost effective to fix it rather than get a new car. He was willing to forgo a sale so that we could do what we needed to.

I normally stay away from those because they give me palpitations but I needed to stay awake and there was no coffee in sight so eh.\nNobody was at the counter it seemed, but the TV was on. I waltz to the fridge and drink area. \nAll of a sudden I get a\n\n\"CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?\"\n\nI turn around, there's this older woman who looks absolutely pissed to see me. She has a nametag, she works there.\n\nI say \"Oh no, sorry, it's fine, I can find it myself--\"\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\"\n\nI'm startled because it definitely feels like she's talking way too loud for the distance between us which is only a foot, because she's literally in front of me. I assume she's old and deaf or something.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm just getting an energy drink,\" I respond.\n\n\"WELL, WHATEVER, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN FOR YOUR BAD HABITS, DON'T PUT THAT ON ME\", she says, as she walks back to the counter. \n\nUh, am I missing something here? I don't think anything of it, I feel like it's a weird comment to make but, ooookay? I just grab a different flavor and say screw it.\n\nApparently I was also taking too long too though, because she walked up to me again when I contemplated getting some chips and walked to an alternate aisle but didn't say anything that time. Just followed me.\n\nSoooo I walk up to the counter, creeped out but whatever, she follows me and gets behind the counter, I ask for a pack of my Marlboro Menthols, (pretty standard regular white and green box, but I have a feeling she's going to have something to say about it) \n\n\"YECH, YOU SHOULDN'T SMOKE, WOMEN AREN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT\"\nShe grabs a pack of the wrong smokes, like not even the same darn brand, they're L&amp;M reds, scans them and tosses them on the table.\nSo, I point at the ones I want, \"Sorry, these were the wrong ones, could I get that pa--\" \n\nSHE SWATS MY HAND\n\n\"DONT POINT, JUST TELL ME WHAT CRAP YOU WANT, ITS ALL THE SAME ANYWAY\"\n\nShe's making this so much harder than it needs to be, so I literally buy newports and and my drink and leave.

        "text": "I am a recently retired mental health therapist so I have an idea of what I consider professionalism with respect for the client as customer.\nI am new to the area and made an appointment for therapy with someone recommended. The woman asked that I come 30 minutes early to fill out forms because \"I always start my sessions promptly\". \nI arrived as requested and completed the paperwork. I was a bit taken aback at the contract I was to sign which indicated that if I missed an appointment, I would be billed $150. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that I was referred to as a \"patient\", not a client. I know that sounds petty but the concept of patient infers illness and most mental health agencies do not use it any more. So anyway I dutifully signed and handed my papers to the receptionist who then asked me to push a button on a panel next to my therapists name to alert her that I was in the waiting area. Again, I found this sorta cold and wondered why the receptionist could not alert the practitioner herself of my presence. So I went and sat down and waited for my \"prompt\" session. I waited for 28 minutes. At no time did the receptionist note that my appointment was delayed or attempt to share with me the reason for the delay. In fact the receptionist never raised her head from her magazine even when I exited. \n\nClearly I have issues with this therapy format. Probably some people here will disagree and I'm okay with that. \n\nFirst: I'm very fortunate to have an excellent physician. I also have a fantastic dentist. I've got a great orthopod and my friend has one of the best surgeons around. All of these professionals have graduate levels of education. None of them require that one sign a contract indicating that a missed appointment will result in being billed. Sometimes there are emergencies. Sometimes calls cannot be made. I am not willing to agree that a therapists time is of any more value than a surgeons. I am, in all of these instances, considered the customer. They, including the therapist, are service providers. Without the customers, these people do not get paid. To inform me that this therapist is different than any other of these providers to the point where she can insist on a contract informing me of her right to payment without performing a service is ludicrous. \n\nSecond: what the hello happened to reception? One pays ones receptionist to alert professionals that the patient is there, to do paperwork, and to inform the client when the therapist is running late. (Etc. etc. etc)\n\nThirdly: and this is rather radical... If I am the customer, and I am, then I am paying for a service based on my needs and desires. I will sit in a waiting room for an hour for my physician because the receptionist will tell me that he or she has been caught up in an emergency. I will wait because I know my physician and value her skills and I consider myself lucky to have her services. But I will not sit and wait 30 minutes for a therapist whom I have never met especially with absolutely no acknowledgement of the lateness by staff. \n\nSo I walked out. When I got home I left a message indicating all of this in a respectful manner. I indicated that i consider myself the customer and was not pleased with the lack of professionalism I experienced and would not return. I also indicated that IF the clinician was considering billing me for my missed session, I would be happy to discuss which of us was the \"no show\" and perhaps I as the customer could bill for MY time. \n\nDon't slaughter me too badly please! I'm used to working in a mental health office where the client came first and was treated with warmth and respect. No client ever sat in the waiting room longer than 6 minutes without the receptionist intervening, communicating with the clinician, and communicating with the client the reason for the delay. ",

Well, that just happened.\n\nSo I'm going through the drive through, and I order my favorite chicken tenders, fries, and a soda. (This is important.) I pull up to the window to pay, and I hand the cashier my card, and he asks me \"credit card?\" So I said \"No, debit.\" And he shuts the window, and just before he gets to swiping the card, he OPENS THE WINDOW BACK UP, to say...\n\n\"So how are you going to enter the numbers?\" \n\nI was caught off-guard here, so I just said... \"I don't--\" and before I can even finish, he says \"You can't, so it's credit.\" \n\nThe hell? Okay, I will concede here that MAYBE I didn't entirely think about it before speaking, but in my defense, as far as I know, he's asking me if I'm paying with a credit card. Which I'm not. If you need to ring it up as credit, then just do that. It would have done us both a lot better for you to just ring it up how you normally need to. I didn't order an extra 10 seconds of sass from the cashier, and I didn't come here to be quizzed. I just want food.\n\nHe says \"You don't know how many people come in here, and say 'debit' when I ask them.\" \n\nDude. Alright? I get it. In your eyes, I'm a fucking idiot for not knowing how your system operates. At other stores, they don't even need to ask. And I've come to this store before. I've always used that exact same card to pay. I've not been asked what kind of card it is up to this point. I don't need a lecture on the statistics with entire citations of how I'm an idiot, either. I already knew that. \n\nSo by this point I'm pretty irritated. I stop using my \"friendly voice\" and retreat into a sort of \"neutral mode,\" where I only say the things that I need to say. \"Okay,\" \"Yeah,\" etc. Normally, I would think that would be the end of it. But no.\n\nBefore he hands me my food, he says to me \"yeah, those chicken tenders cost more than the nuggets, and they're the exact same thing anyway, sooo....\" \n\nOkay...Number one, thanks for telling me AFTER I've ordered my food! It's a bit too late to change anything, since you've already swiped my deb---I mean....my \"credit\" card. Number two, maybe your taste buds are different than mine, but to me, they don't taste the same. Number three, and most importantly, I. Don't. Care. I asked for chicken tenders. If I want to spend more money on something YOU personally don't find as appealing, that is my priority. Not yours. You don't need to concern yourself with my spending habits. \n\nI quickly grab my food and bolt the hell out of there. Ranting out loud to myself about what I just experienced.\n\nMaybe I'm overreacting to the situation, but at this point I don't care. I work in the service industry. I always try to make their transactions quick, easy, and painless without giving anyone any crap. I wish other people could do the same.\n\nJust needed to vent a bit. Sorry if the formatting sucks. Thanks for reading.\n\nUPDATE: I actually dug the receipt out of the trash just so I could go online and provide feedback about that experience. I didn't feel like being contacted about the experience, because frankly the food wasn't that good anyway and I kind of just want to be done with it. Thanks for your responses. Reading through them all has been super cathartic and enjoyable. Stay sweet. :)",

I had an appointment to visit with an intellectual at a store that doesn't actually sell fruit, despite the name. At our meeting this young man proceeds to try and fix my computer that had gone completely dead, he took it to the back and did some magic to make it turn on. This is where we began an hour long journey to figure out what the issue actually was. Through running tests and trying new things I began to talk to the young man about life, his career aspirations, etc and we had a really nice time chatting. At one point I gestured to a pretty simple network adapter he was using, I asked him how much it was because I needed one...$30.\n\nMe: \"Yikes, I think I can do without\" Him: \"Yeah.. I don't blame you\"\n\nAfter he restored my computer and it was loading, he went to the back. Upon his return, he came bearing a gift; a brand new network adapter that had been taken out of the box.\n\nHim: \"For you, I found this one way in the back\"\nMe: \"I can just HAVE this?\" \nHim: \"Yes you can, you've been so patient being here on your day off and this adapter was made for pennies on the dollar and was just sitting on a shelf in the back room\" \nMe: \"No way, this is the nicest thing anyone has done for me in awhile! Thank you!\"\n\nSo I left the fruit store in the best attitude that was carried on throughout the day/week. Such a small gesture, from a guy who was thanking me for being patient, when I should have been thanking him for working on what should have been a day off.",

I got a little irritated by this. I've never had anyone be so aggressive like that towards me before. I said no, I definitely wanted to leave the company, and I was willing to pay the early termination fee.\n\nThen she asked me, \"What if I gave you a tablet, a Samsung/iPad/etc etc., would you stay on the line that way?\"\n\nSo naturally, my ears pricked up. An iPad? Really? What's the catch?\n\nShe said nothing. I would get to keep my current tablet and current plan and not pay a penny for an iPad. \n\nOf course I agreed to that! A free iPad? Hell yeah. \n\nShe then proceeded to ask me what I do, how I was that day, and we talked about how she had worked a 12 hour shift with no end in sight (I told her that she needs to demand a break or demand to go home). She was a little on the weird side, but that was ok as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo now I have a free iPad in the mail. Thanks, [big name cell phone company]!",

The batteries lasted about 30 minutes before they either ran out or she retrieved her play thing.\n\nAs I noted above, I can guess which of the ladies it was..  \nWe had an interesting shared ride into the office - me cheesy grin, her embarrassed silence. \n\nDecided not to complain about the noise on checkout. \n",

        "text": "I want to preface this by letting you guys know that I work in retail. I love my job, and the customers (most anyway), and my coworkers. That's why, when I see retail personnel being treated like shit when I'm not at work, I usually try to step in, because I know how bad it feels to be treated horribly.\n\nSo, a couple of days ago, on my first day off of three, I went to the grocery store chain that I work at, not the actual store I work at, but one down the road from my location. Reason being is because I just don't like getting spotted by my manager, because she usually asks me to work when I go in on my days off.\n\nI had just finished shopping and I was making my way to the register to checkout. I started to unload my cart, which wasn't a lot, and I just waited patiently behind the older man that was in front of me. I had caught the general gist of the conversation, and he wasn't happy with one of the prices some soup was ringing up at, I guess? I didn't hear all that well, but I also wasn't paying attention. It wasn't a big issue by any means.\n\nThe cashier behind the counter was trying to patiently and as well as politely explain to the gentleman that it was a specialty soup, and it wasn't on sale like the rest. She was very nice in her explanation of why it might seem confusing, since the soups were all in the same aisle. I could tell she was about to offer to just adjust the price for him anyway, just to make him happy, like she was getting ready to void it off and scan it for the price he wanted, when he went *off*.\n\n&gt;Him: \"This is bullshit! I just want it for that fucking price!\" \n\nI perked right the fuck up, because I was already irritated, and now I was infuriated.\n\n&gt;Cashier: \"Oh, sir, I'll change it for you. I was just about to actually, just because it's so confusing! Sorry about that!\" \n\nShe really didn't need to apologize but she did, but whatever. I was still watching the guy because he seemed really pissed still, and I was right. What he said next was *so* wrong, that I had to intervene.\n\n&gt;Him: \"Goddamn right, you are. Fucking spics don't know shit about prices...\" \n\nHe mumbled the last part, and looked over at me. I widened my eyes at him, and straightened myself up.\n\n&gt;Me: \"Did you just call her what I think you called her?\" \n\nI knew the cashier had heard him, but she was pretending she hadn't which was probably for the best. I didn't want her to get in trouble, but I also was ready to defend her again.\n\n&gt;Him: \"It was nothing, just stay out of it.\" \n\n&gt;Me: \"No, I think it was actually something. Don't fucking call her something racist just because you aren't getting your clam chowder thirty cents cheaper, that's fucking bullshit. You're cheap as fuck.\" \n\nI shut up because I was afraid that I would have said worse, and I was unintentionally getting louder with my voice. I always do that when I get angry for some reason, even if I try to keep it quiet. \n\nThe guy just looked at me, kind of sputtered, and then muttered, \"Fucking bitch.\" Under his breath, and then the receipt came out, so he grabbed it from the printer by himself, which you don't do at all, and then walked away. \n\nI looked at the cashier, and she just looked stoic honestly, like she was used to it. I felt so bad, but decided not to say anything related to what had just happened, hoping it would help her get over it faster, but goddamn. What the fuck is wrong with people? Why would you do that to someone just because you didn't get your goddamn soup for a little tiny bit cheaper than what you thought it should have been? Especially when the cashier was being nothing but nice to you, as well as helpful, and willing to change the price anyway? I mean what the actual fuck is that? I'm sorry that my story isn't about a customer service representative being a dick to me, and it's the other way around, but I figured this story should be placed here.\n\nI'm still so angry about that, and I feel so bad for that cashier, because she really did not deserve that. I just don't understand why people have to resort to racist insults if things don't immediately go their way. So absolutely wrong. ",

The cashier says that he will get someone and says to proceed to register 2. \n\nApparently, the cashier assessed the situation faster than me...because he made a point to say that WE should go over first, since we were first in line. In that guy's rush to checkout, he was going to disregard the idea that we *might* want to possibly check out a little faster too.\n\nIcing on the cake... we got outside and found that he parked his car directly on the curb.

I paid for my fuel, and then had an issue buying my coffee (because the guy knocking off might have just been a bit tired due to working all night) and because of my coffee requirements, a queue built up. I drink coffee perhaps three times a year, and I have no idea what the process is in making it.\n\n\n*I don't know if this is a thing anywhere other than in Australia.\n\n\nI went over to the coffee waiting spot, for my coffee. The person making it conversationally said that the machine she was using was due to be upgraded and currently it took a while to make the coffees. Fair enough. IT WAS 6AM IN THE MORNING.\n\nSo then a bloke in the queue to pay for petrol yelled over that he wanted a drink. I *helped* the barista by writing it down for her. She was at the time making my ordinary latte. I tell you this because I am pretty sure lattes are the easiest coffee to make? Except for plain black coffee? Feel free to correct me, I am a tea-drinker and have no idea.\n\n\nLet me again remind you, it was 6am on a Sunday morning.\n\n\nOld mate in the queue comes over and starts complaining that he has to wait for his coffee and he has to travel an hour to get to work. I mutter sympathetic remarks, because everyone there was on their way to work, and that's crap.\n\n\nThe barista now has to stop coffee-ing and serves some of the queue, because, get this, it's a PETROL STATION and they're more interested in selling $500 of petrol in those five minutes than his single cappuccino.\n\n\nThis guy starts pacing around the petrol station, smacking things with his newspaper, muttering to himself, looking like a real idiot. I thought he'd walked out, but, no. Still there.\n\n\nThe barista returns and finishes making him his drink, and gives it to him. He finishes with a whine that he's going to be late for work, and leaves the building.\n\n\nIt was Sunday. It was 6am. The woman behind him was in business attire. I was ahead of him in business attire. There were at least six other people in the store in hi-vis. Did he think we were all at the petrol station in the middle of winter for a social visit? Why was he the special person who deserved immediate service?\n\n\nStupid idiots who make dickheads of themselves in public...\n",

        "text": "Hello all, I just found this subreddit and thought this would be perfect to share. This happened last year and I'm still pretty irritated over it, but back then I was pissed. \n\nIn 2014, my hubby and I had a wedding. Our wedding planner recommended us a Cake Lady (CL for short) who owned her own business where we lived and could make us a wonderful, delicious cake for not so much. \n\nWe used her and the entire thing was normal. She was nice the whole time and delivered our cake at the ceremony on time, no problem. The cake wasn't anything over the top, it was a 3 tier cake wrapped in fondant matching our wedding colors and had our initials in the middle. It was perfect. \n\nNow, CL told us that she gives her customers a anniversary cake for their 1 year anniversary.  Basically, she replicates the top tier of the cake and we can either pick it up or she will deliver. However, she said that in the past most of her clients divorce within the first year so she no longer seeks out the customers. Instead, we should reach out to her if we wanted the cake. Fine and dandy, right?\n\nSo a year later, 2015, after returning from our 1 year anniversary trip we took, we wanted to celebrate with that cake. I reach out to CL, who says sure no problem, I'll have it done on Sunday. I'll deliver, even! \n\nWell, come Sunday I receive an email stating, \"I forgot to write down that I was supposed to make this cake, I'm sorry, can you guys come get it next Sunday?\" \n\nI was completely understanding. Shit happens. People forget, it's honestly no big deal. I say of course. \n\nCome the following Saturday she emails me again. I was out all day and didn't see the email until 10 pm and she sent it at like 7 pm. \n\nCL: Hey I really need you to respond asap. I need to ask you some questions about this cake. I can't make it until you respond.\n\nWell crap. \n\nMe: Im so sorry, I just saw this. \n\nI answer her questions and I don't recall what it was. I think she was asking if I wanted a replica of the top tier or something else. Anyway, because she waited until the last second to ask me these questions, another week without a cake. Also, CL had my cell number so I don't understand why she didn't call me if it was so important to ask me this. \n\nAfter some back and forth we set it up for the following Sunday. My hubby is off on Sunday's so that's the best time for us. I set it up myself so nothing could go wrong. I got the location of said pick up, had the cake details planned out, time planned and all that good stuff. She told me Sunday, pick it up between 3-6 pm at her location. If she's not there then she is at a tasting at locate coffee shop and to pick it up there. Sounds good. \n\nCome Sunday, we drive to her location which is apparently a house. I was under the impression she had her own shop per what the wedding planner said, but hey lots of people run shops from home. I go up there and no one is home, so I assume she is at her tasting. I call her shop number and her cell number just to let her know we are on the way. No answer from either. \n\nWe head to the coffee shop she said she gives tastings at and she is no where to be found. Okay, wtf. It's a little after 3 so she will probably call me back. Well, we wait for an hour and no word, so I call again to both numbers. No answer. I shoot her an email. No answer. I wait and call again, it's almost 6. No answer. We literally waited in the city her shop is in waiting for her to reach us. Nothing. Well, it's way past 6 and still no word. We are upset and head home.\n\nI'd like to say she reached out to us later and explained what happened, but she didn't. I haven't heard a peep from CL since. As I was digging around her facebook page I realized what she was doing instead of giving us the cake. She posted that she \"made this wonderful birthday cake\" for none other than the wedding planner we had. So I'm glad she was more important than us. Also, that must have meant she ignored my knocks at the door, since she was there all day making a cake. All in all, she just didn't want to make us a cake. I understand that it's kind of a free cake, but if she didn't want to make it or couldn't, she should have said something. \n\nI wrote a review on that page which promptly got deleted but I found some other review sites of hers and I blasted her on there.  \n\nThanks for listening to me rant.  \n\n ",

        "text": "So...forgot about those anonymizing rules there for a moment and I can't edit the title of the existing post so I am proactively re-posting in the expectation that the mods will delete the original.  Sorry mods!\n\nThis was quite some time ago. Back when fast food place used warming bins and bin timers for prepared food and the hold time was ten minutes for all sandwiches from the time they went into the warming bin (so yeah, a LONG time ago - late 80's maybe very early 90's).\n\nI go into a very crowded fast food place to buy my fave - a fish sandwich. I'm at the back of a long line and I note that there are two fish sandwiches in the bin that should have been tossed about a half hour before. No problem, they are obviously busy and hopefully they may have new fish come up while I am in line.\n\nAbout ten minutes later I am in front but unfortunately those two poor fish, now 40 minutes overdue for the waste bin, are the only ones there.\n\nMe: Hi! I'd like a fish sandwich and a small coke for here but not one from the bin, a fresh one please.\n\nCashier: Uhmm, I'm not sure I can do that.\n\nMe: Sure you can!\n\nCashier: Let me get my manager.\n\nManager: I'm sorry sir, we can't make a fresh fish sandwich for you when we have some already made.\n\nNow at this point I am completely astonished. I've never been in this store before but I am a manager at a fast food place and I can't imagine EVER saying something like that even if the fish I had in the bin WEREN'T supposed to be tossed almost an hour ago!\n\nMe: Well, according to the bin timer those should have been thrown out 45 minutes ago so I don't see what the problem is. You can't sell those anyway.\n\nManager: (takes bin timer from fish) These just came up, the bin timer was accidentally left in there from a previous run.\n\nMe: OK, I'll buy that. But I have been in line and now talking to you for fifteen minutes now and those two fish sandwiches were in the bin when I came in. Assuming they came up right before I came in the store they needed to be wasted five minutes ago so you still have to make fresh fish.\n\nHer: (clearly not used to someone who knows what they are talking about and doesn't know what to say)\n\nMe: Look, I'm a manager at blank location. I don't care if your owner or SM has a \"Never Old Until It's Sold\" policy and I could care less if you keep those fish sandwiches and sell them some time next week. You can either make me a fresh fish sandwich or I'll leave and call corporate and we both know how that will go down.\n\nTo the two poor souls who got really old fish, sorry but I'm not the fish police. I just don't like eating really old fish myself.\n",

I despise these people.\n\n\nI had just finished closing the store I worked in, having had a pretty bad day dealing with more than the usual amount of crappy customers. All I wanted to do was grab a pack of cigarettes from the gas station across the street and head home.\n\n\nSo, I pull into the gas station lot, park my car, and head inside. It was fairly busy as usual for the time, so I had to wait a bit in line to make my purchase. Working retail myself, I never blame an overworked cashier for the length of the line, I was just happy to be off the clock for the night. By the time I was the second person in line, there were three customers already behind me.\n\n\nThen I notice a car park quickly, nearly diagonally, into the handicapped spot right outside the door, and this dude rushes out of the car and into the store. Once inside, he immediately cuts into the line in front of me and says, \"gimme a box of Newport shorts\".\n\n\nFor a second, I was stupified, thinking WTF? And then it dawned on me...I'm not working! I'm not getting paid to put up with this, I don't *have* to smile and be nice! So I immediately said, \"Um, **No**. I'm next, get in line.\"\nHis response was, \"I'm just getting a pack of smokes.\" as he plops a ten down on the counter.\n\n\nNow I've instantly gone from irritated to pissed. Normally I'm not the type to use my size and weight advantage (6'2\" 215 lbs) to force things, but this just pissed me off to the point where I moved into his personal space and raised my voice and calmly but loudly repeated, \"**No. I'm next**. And you're going to get in line behind *everyone* else here, and wait your turn, or I'll use my car to block you into that handicapped spot and she's (the cashier) going to call the police. **Move. Now.**\"\n\n\nDude looks at the cashier, then back at me, then at the customers behind me, then back at me, then (quietly) says, \"Fuck this.\" grabs his money and runs out of the store. I then smile at the cashier and pay for my cigarettes, and she says \"Thanks, he does that all the time.\"\n\n\nNot this time, buddy.",

Some druggy smashed the window to steal the Hertz NeverLost GPS.  \n\nI filed a police report, turned the car in for another one, and when I was at the front desk, I talked to the manager.  She was sympathetic.  She told me, \"I've worked here for eight years and this has never happened before.\"  \n\nA week or so later, my girlfriend parked her car at the hotel, right in front of the office.  At about 2:00 a.m., her car was stolen out of the parking lot.  Some other druggy had smashed the window and while he was stealing things, he found the spare key in the glove box, so he took the whole car.  The police caught him because they thought he was drunk.  He hadn't disengaged the parking brake.  The car was smoking and the window was obviously smashed.  \n\nAfter we recovered the car, I was in the office again.  Some other customers are there.  This same manager tells me, \"I've worked here for eight years and this has never happened before.\"  \n\nI said, \"Really?  You haven't had a car broken into in eight years?\"  \n\nShe smiled and said something about some kind of safety award from corporate or something.  The other customers looked impressed.  \n\nI told her, \"You know, that's the same thing you told me last week when my other car was broken into.\"  Apparently, it happened often enough that she told that story about eight years so much that she couldn't remember having told me the week prior.

        "text": "The other day, after having lunch, my friends and I decided to go try the new bubble tea spot next door.\n\nNow, before I proceed, I feel like I should preface this by saying that all this occurred in the local college town. A college that I also attended a couple of years ago, and while attending, also worked at a bubble tea/frozen yogurt spot. That was my first job that I completely supported myself on. It was stressful and annoying, but I did really love that job.\n\nSequence of events:\n\nMy friends and I walk in. We say a quick \"hi\" to the guy behind the bbt counter. (Note: the bbt counter is inside of a restaurant that's been there for a few years. The actual restaurant was closed for the catering event (even though 2 workers were behind the counter and visible through the kitchen door) but the bbt counter was still open)\n\nNo response from the bbt guy. He's on his phone for a few seconds, then turns around and starts making bbts.\n\nHe's doing this for a couple of minutes. But at first it's no problem because my friends and I are still deciding what we want from the menu. We're standing a couple of feet away from the counter to show that we're not quite ready either.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I step up to the counter, ready to order. Bbt guy is still making bbt, turning towards us to check some things on the counter, and turning away from us to use the blender behind him. Everytime he turns towards us, I give him a small smile and a wave. He is constantly looking down, not acknowledging us.\n\nThis continues for 10 minutes. He's making bbts. For people that aren't even in the store yet. (The place was empty when my friends and I walked in, and remained empty even after we left)\n\nI'm getting pretty annoyed at this point. I remember when I used to work, people would call in ahead to order. This place may have an online ordering system and he might have been filling online orders. But you have actual live customers standing in front of you, and you're blatantly ignoring them.\n\nHe turned around again, and I tried to wave at him again, and yet again he ignored me. At this point, I decided to leave. I was going to go grocery shopping at a local asian market that I could get bbt that I know I would like anyway. Why would I wait for a bbt spot that I've never tried and give business and undeserved tips to this kid that doesn't know how to work in a service industry?\n\nI was so annoyed that I almost jumped on yelp, and even looked at the bbt spot's fb page. I wanted to leave a note to the owners. I stopped myself, but I still kind of do want to notify someone. Having worked this job myself, it takes 0 effort to say a quick \"Hey guys, I'll be with you in just a few minutes, I hope you don't mind waiting.\" Or at the very least, take our orders down, tell us it'll be a couple minutes, and just add them to your queue of drinks to make. Would it be over the top to send a private message to the fb page over this?\n\nedit: TL;DR: Ex bbt-girl goes to get bbt, completely ignored by bbt-guy for 15 minutes. Walks out because lack of service.",

And the item was the main piece in the window :s\n\n\n\n\nAnother gripe that happened recently. I bought a disney infinity game pad for my younger cousin,  It was used, 8 bucks no big deal, the guy at the shop said it may or may not work, all of them are universal except one.  I get home and that was the one that wouldn't work.  Fair enough my fault. \n\nI go to a different store, a certain game store, ask if they had the certain one I was looking for (has a number on the back of it)  and explain that I need the one for the ps4.  And she said they are all universal, and I said yaeh except one and I made that mistake yesterday,\n\n&gt;No they will all 100% work\n\nI am not trying to doubt you \n. I swear, i wish they all were too, and I don't want to be picky,  it's just I tested this out and it didn't work on the one you are about to sell me.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes I said thank you for the help but I don't need it anymore.\n\nI had websites on my phone proving her wrong, I wanted to so bad be able to set it up in the store and show her.... but it's whatever.",

Today we had at least four full tables that had ordered buckets of beer, and we were a little short on ice, so I got down to the supermarket through the elevator and took out four bags of ice and went off to the counter.\n\nThe line was pretty short, and I was next in line when this girl literally just passed by me and got in front of me, all without saying anything. She had a basket full of different stuff, so that would probably take sometime.\n\nBefore the cashier finished her transaction with the guy who was in front of me earlier before this girl just cut me off, I tapped her shoulder, she looked at me with the most innocent look on her face.\n\nI said, \"Excuse me, but can you please move to the back of the line?\" She asked why. \"Because you just cut me off and I need the ice now for work.\"\n\n\"Oh, but this will only take a few minutes, and I don't wanna wait in line too long,\" Seriously? You can't spare a few minutes waiting in a line?\n\nI raise one of the baskets in my hand that each contained two long bags of ice. \"You do see I'm holding four bags of ice, right?\" \n\nShe just smiled at me. \"So?\" she said in the most obnoxious tone ever. \n\n\"Ice melts: your bags of biscuits, chips and candies don't,\" I said.\n\nThe cashier finishes her transaction with the guy in front of me earlier and the girl quickly moves forward and immediately starts putting her stuff down in front of the cashier, but she stops her.\n\n\"Miss, I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to ask you to move to the back of the line,\" The girl asks why. \n\n\"Because I saw you cut off at least four people who have more items in their carts than you have in your basket, and also because that guy's ice,\" she points to me. \"needs to be taken care of first because ice easily expires and we don't want to make a mess near the counter.\"\n\nThe girl tries to insist it's no big deal for me, and that's when I speak up again. \"I don't recall ever telling you that, now it's either you move to the back and wait, or go across the street and buy at the other supermarket.\"\nObviously she has no choice, so she goes to the end of the line. I finish my transaction and get back up to work.\n\nTL;DR: Girl cuts me and three other people off. Eventually gets sent to the back.",

As the young cashier went to grab the hotdog an elderly man stepped up behind us, she informed him that her station was closed after us and the next register (no line) could take him. \n\n\"I just need a water\" He said as he grabbed a bottle from the self serve bin.  And before she could say anything he leans in between my husband and I and tosses some wadded up bills at the cashier and ran off. \n\nWe were all in shock! Poor girl was so flustered and was fuming, we both almost forgot my hotdog. WTF. ",

        "text": "I was in a PX overseas a few years ago with a co-worker.  As soon as we got in the store, this guy goes to the rack full of PT shorts, grabs about 20 pairs of them off the rack, goes to another location, and stuffs them behind a bunch of pillow cases.  \n\nI asked him what he was doing, but he didn't answer.  Instead, he stood by the rack of PT shorts and waited for an employee.  This TCN (third-country national) approaches him and asks if he needs help.  \n\nMy co-worker points to the empty spot on the rack and says, \"Do you have this in XL?\"  The employee looks and says, \"I'm sorry, as long as there are shorts on this rack, I can't bring any more out.\"\n\nMy co-worker says, \"These are all size Medium.  I need XL.\"  The guy explains again that he can't bring any more out until the ones on the rack are gone.  \n\nMy co-worker explained that he had talked to several employees and got the same answer.  He even spoke to the manager and she told him the same thing.  \n\nAfter a couple of weeks, there must have been 200 pairs of medium PT shorts stuffed behind the pillow cases and bed sheets.  We'd go back to the PX every few days and it would be full again, but always with Medium shorts.  \n\nI don't think they ever discovered the shorts behind the sheets and pillow cases, but every day, the rack of shorts would be restocked with size medium.

        "text": "So, everytime I have asked someone to check the \"back\" I usually get told that everything is on the floor. Ok, after working retail sometimes you can't be arsed. Well yesterday I went to a big retail clothing chain that is by work and tried to find workout pants that I could wear to school and not look like workout pants.\n\nI am in the store, find the correct size and color, but would also like to find the pants in black. Almost everything on the racks in that section are XS and S or XL with hardly any M or L. Ok, weird but ok maybe they are out. Then a young lady comes and offers to help, which has never happened before at that store. Explain problem to her, she checks racks, comments on the weird number of sizes, then dissapears. I THINK TYPICAL.\n\nWell no, she comes back with a little scanner gun, asks me for the pants I have,scans them, looks up the color and size I want, and says : It is in the back. NEVER, NEVER have I heard this . Then she goes to the back and 15 min later she reappears with the correct pants and actually says she is sorry about the wait. I was so happy, and will write the store. Had to share a a good customer service story.\n\nEdit: spelling",

It makes it even more special when you speak to a rep who does what you ask with no hassles!\n\nThe following is a transcript from a popular domain/hosting company:\n\n**THEM:** Thank you for chatting with us! How may I help you today? \t \n\n**ME:** Hi there, \t \nRecently my web hosting package auto renewed. I am aware you sent plenty of emails reminding me this was going to happen, however life has been quite hectic lately (new 3 week old baby), and i kept putting off cancelling the auto renew. I'm contacting you to please ask for a refund on this. \t\n\t\n**THEM:** Wow! Congratulations! Boy or girl? \t \n\n**ME:** Girl - Named [NAME] \t \nSpeaking of which, BRB 2 mins, crying child \t\t\n\n**THEM:** Sweet name! I know a good friend named [NAME]! I'll see what I can do. What's your 4 digit Call-In PIN? \t \n\n**ME:** Back - Thanks, Wife is a buffy fan so we named her after a character from there \t \nand thank you for your help, the pin is [XXXX]\t\n\t\n**THEM:** Yeah, the vampire series! I remember that.\nLet me get into the account. \t \nAre we talking to the [DOMAIN].net domain? \t\n\t\n**ME:** Thanks - Just for confirmation, i'd like to keep the domain name, just cancel &amp; refund the hosting for now, thanks. \t \nYeah, it's [DOMAIN].net \t\n\t\n**THEM:** OK. We need to cancel the server for me to process a refund. Now when we do so, all the files you have on the server will be removed too. Do you have any thing you need to back up before we proceed? \t \n\t\n**ME:** I don't think so - never actually got around to doing anything with the site, just pointed it to my youtube channel, so you're good to go ahead and wipe it. \t \n\t\n**THEM:** OK. Let's do it:\n[LINK]\nSelect the hosting server then click on Cancel Products. \t \n\t\n**ME:** Done \t \n\t\n**THEM:** OK. Please hold on. \t \nDone. \t \nThe refund will reflect within 5 to 7 days. \t\n\n**ME:** Thank you very much, you're amazing. I came expecting to have to battle with customer services like most places, but you have been exceptionally polite and helpful, i really appreciate it \t \nI assume everything is done, and i'm OK to close chat now? \n\t\n**THEM:** Yup! \t \nYou have a great weekend [NAME]! \t\n",

Dialtone here means fault inside house.  No dialtone means fault with telco)\n\nWhen I got to work I called the phone company and spoke with their tech line.  Right off the bat I said; \"No dialtone at the NID.\"  The person insisted on troubleshooting things like if my phone was plugged in to the wall.  I told her I was not at home, and that no NID means their problem.  Again insisted I be at home so they can do local troubleshooting and wouldn't send someone out without completing it.\n\nOk, when I got home that night I called again.  Different person, of course.  As soon as I said \"No dialtone at the NID\" she said; \"I'm booking a technician to come out.  I asked if they needed to do local troubleshooting.  \"No point, no dialtone at the NID means we automatically send out a tech.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"    AAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH!",
