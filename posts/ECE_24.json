So the professor gave us only 6 exercices, that seem to be to easy, and in french. I would love to work a little more while having harder exercices. You guys have any idea of a book I could look for and maybe some resolution os the proposed exercices?",

        "text": "TLDR: my battery charger IC only sends voltage pulses (go from full V to 0) whenever I turn the switch on. The charger IC only stays high/at a consistent voltage when I first have the IC connected to a 5V usb power supply. If i switch it on in this state, I can then disconnect the power supply and the charger IC will output a consistent voltage just fine. Parts list at the bottom of the post.\n\nI'm currently trying to build a portable monitor using a rechargeable battery and a monitor I got off of Amazon. I have the battery (ICR18650, 3.7 V, 6600 mAh) connected to a battery charger IC (TP4056), connected to a buck-boost converter, which is finally connected to the controller board for the monitor.\nI tested all the connections and such with simple wires + a breadboard and everything seemed to be working fine.\n\nHowever, after assembling the monitor, I noticed that whenever I switched the power on, it would only send a single pulse instead of a consistent voltage.\nAfter playing around with my circuit, I think I narrowed the problem down to something in the battery charger IC. I can bypass this pulsing problem by connecting a 5V USB charging input into the battery charger IC, which allows me to maintain a consistent voltage even after the USB charger is disconnected - the circuit runs on the battery supply alone from there. However, I want to be able to do this without having to start out connecting my circuit to a 5V power supply every time I want to turn the monitor on. What is the problem here?\n\nThese are the parts I'm using:\n\nLi-On Battery (3.7 V, 6600 mAh): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0137IPVY6/\n\nSwitch: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N2U8PK0/\n\nDC-DC voltage regulator: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0129HYAW0\n\nMicro USB Lithium Battery Charger Board: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LHD9D7E\n\nMonitor + Controller Board: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FF8PZA6\n\nThanks in advance for all your help guys",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/88elt7/using_vunit_with_vhdl/",
        "text": "I'm looking into testing VHDL modules with vunit and have a few questions on best practices.\n\nSo I have a basic counter module\n\n    generic (WIDTH: natural;\n             MAX: natural);\n    port (clk:      in  std_logic;\n          en:       in  std_logic;\n          rst:      in  std_logic;\n          load:     in  std_logic;\n          loadData: in  unsigned((WIDTH - 1) downto 0);\n          o:        out unsigned((WIDTH - 1) downto 0);\n          overflow: out std_logic);\n\nFirstly how much of it's behaviour would be normal to test? This module is for use in an FPGA, however next year I'm going to be designing and having fabricated an ASIC, so it'd be good to start getting into the habit of finding bugs early.\n\nSo lets say I want to go all out on the tests.\n\nMy first thought is that I should test the outputs are never unknown. If I do:\n\n    main: process\n    begin\n        test_runner_setup(runner, runner_cfg);\n        check_not_unknown(overflow);\n        wait for 500 ns;\n        rst &lt;= '0';\n        en &lt;= '1';\n        wait for 1 ms;\n        test_runner_cleanup(runner);\n    end process main;\n\nThen the test passes as long as in my testbench I default rst to be '1'.\n\nHowever if in my module I set overflow &lt;= 'X' on overflow instead of '1' then the test still passes which isn't correct.\n\nIf instead I put that call outside the process block the test always fails, maybe because the output is unknown at time 0?\n\nIf instead I have the following outside of the process block:\n\n    check_not_unknown(clock =&gt; clk, en =&gt; testEn, expr =&gt; overflow);\n\nThen it works as desired. Checking every rising edge that the overflow signal is known, as long as testEn is '1'.\n\nI'm assuming that's probably the correct way to do this. Although I'd prefer a test that picked up an unknown even if it was between clock edges.\n\nNext up. My reset is asynchronous (as defined by the spec of the project I'm doing). So I should test that if the reset signal is asserted then o = to_unsigned(0, o'length); check_implication seems to be the most appropriate.\n\n    check_implication(rst = '1', o = to_unsigned(0, o'length));\n\nBut that seems to fail. I'm not sure why.\n\n    oEqualsZero &lt;= '1' when (o = to_unsigned(0, o'length)) else '0';\n    check_implication(clk, rst, rst, oEqualsZero);\n\nThis works. If in the reset case I set o to be 1s, then the test fails, if I set it to be 0s the test passes. However it only checks on clock edges. If I forget to add rst to the sensitivity list, ie. I have a synchronous clock, then the test still passes.\n\n    process (clk)\n    begin\n        -- asíncrono reset\n        if (rst = '1') then\n            tmp &lt;= (others =&gt; '0');\n            overflow &lt;= '0';\n        elsif (rising_edge(clk)) then\n        ...\n\nHowever interestingly enough:\n\n    process (clk)\n    begin\n        -- asíncrono reset\n        if (rising_edge(clk)) then\n            if (rst = '1') then\n                tmp &lt;= (others =&gt; '0');\n                overflow &lt;= '0';\n            elsif (en = '1') then\n            ...\n\nThat fails the test. I'm not sure why.\n\nIs there a way to set up a decent test for async resets? My idea is from a test driven development point of view. If I have a spec for a module I can turn that spec into tests then write the code.\n\nNext up let's look at a test to make sure that the outputs only change if when en is set. This makes sure that I don't forget to wire up the en signal. check_stable() comes to mind. I can enable the check when not rst, with a start_event as not en and an end event of en.\n\n    en &lt;= not en after 500 ns;\n    notRst &lt;= not rst;\n    notEn &lt;= not en;\n    check_stable(clock =&gt; clk,\n                 en =&gt; notRst,\n                 start_event =&gt; notEn,\n                 end_event =&gt; en,\n                 expr =&gt; slvO);\n\nThat seems to always fail.\n\nThis repeats for every test I try and do. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks",

I went to undergrad for Bioengineering, graduated and started as a software QA engineer practically the next day back in spring 2016. It's been almost two years since I graduated and worked as a software QA engineer, and I'm bored out of my mind with software testing. For the first year it was enough of a challenge to learn how the device worked in order to do the testing, but now I know how it works so there's not enough challenge in it anymore. That's why last year, when I started to realize I was having trouble finding a challenge and growing at work, I asked for tuition reimbursement to go back to grad school for a MS in Electrical Engineering. I love science, challenging problems, and design projects so grad school has been very rewarding so far. I have two years left of part time studying to do, but I want to make some gains in the workplace.\n\nThe opportunity currently being presented to me:\n\nThere are a few electrical engineers at work I'm comfortable reaching out to, because they've said, \"if there's anything I can do to help you on your hardware path, please let me know.\" I need to leverage this economically while also showing them how grateful I am that they even bothered to offer their help.\n\nMy idea:\n\nMy idea to leverage their help, challenge myself in the workplace, and set myself up to transition over to an electrical engineering role is to ask for a part time unpaid internship or a project on top of my full time job software testing.\n\n\nI'm writing here to find out if anyone else has found themselves in a similar position and how they were able to leverage help offered by engineers in their desired department.\n\n\nI deeply appreciate any feedback on my idea, my post, or anything else.\n",

One with the other as a minor?  Something else entirely?\n* Would a secondary priority of wide employment options outside of education change your recommendation?\n\nI know that \"Mechatronics\" degrees degrees exist, and that seems to be the best fit, but unfortunately they aren't very available in my area and I've been told they might have to cut some essential instruction out of a 120-credit degree.  \"Robotics\" also exists (though usually only as a graduate program in my area, CO), but it appears to be a little more specialized in just that area than might be wise considering the secondary goal of being more widely employable if teaching doesn't work out.\n\nMy expectation based on some informational interviews is that projects would be very wide-ranging; anything from purely mechanical solutions to electronics, Arduino/Raspberry Pi projects, robotics, possibly even including some bioengineering projects.  In addition to building electronics I expect to use 3D printers, laser cutters, machining tools, etc. with students, insofar as my school would allow them.  My initial research seems to indicate that Electrical Engineering with some Mechanical electives (rather than vice versa) might make more sense due to my anticipation that electronics are likely to be more prevalent, but I don't have the background to know if that's accurate.\n\nCan anyone here offer any insight into this?\n\n**Working in schools**\n\nIf anyone here is currently or has worked in schools:\n\n* What background do you have, what did your school want, and how do those two mesh?\n* What challenges have you faced (logistical, political, legal, etc?) while teaching?\n* What are some \"gotchas\" or \"aha moments\" you've experienced that you wish you knew before going into education related to teaching engineering/science in schools?

My coursework so far has focused on electromagnetics and DSP, and I'm going to be taking my first class on antenna design in the fall.\n\nI have a few questions to see if I'm on the right track.\n\n1) I'm currently working a position where my responsibilities consist of validation and testing for new radios, intended to be implemented on autonomous vehicles in mines. My employer is paying for the MSEE. My official position isn't \"test engineer\", but it feels a lot like test engineering at times. I've heard that staying in test for too long can be harmful for your career; is this true, and is it likely to be the case in my current position?\n\n2) How useful would a dedicated class on analog integrated circuits be? For my next semester, I have one more open space in my schedule, and I was thinking either radar signal processing or analog IC (there are no other microwave/antenna classes on offer).\n\n3) As a more applied introduction, I'm thinking about getting the basic ham license (technician) over the Summer. Is it still true that ham is a decent introduction to some aspects of applied RF?\n",

The following module is present:\n\nhttp://www.bpt.it/docs/bptistr/vm200%2024027922%2005_02.pdf\n\nI want to start with decoding the video signal for further processing on a raspberry pi. Since this seems the hardest part.\n\nIt uses a differentiated CCIR signal to transmit the video. As far as I can see CCIR is just the precursor of PAL only used for black and white images. To have the signal reliable travel the whole complex it uses a differential line. I think there are four lines used for video:\n\n* [3] video signal coaxial\n* [4] video signal shield cable\n\nIf the video line ends at this monitor, connect a 75Ω (violet-green-black-gold) resistor between terminals 3 and 4.\n\n* [3] pos. video signal twisted\n* [4] neg. video signal pair\n\nIf the video line ends at this monitor, connect a 56Ω (green-blue-black-gold) resistor between terminals 3-4 and 4-5.\n\nVideo input: 1 V pp (0.5 to 1.5 V pp) from coaxial line; + video signal 0.6 V pp, – video signal 0.6 V pp (0.3 to 0.9 V pp) from differential line (twisted pair).\n\n* Video input impedance: ≥22 kΩ.\n* Horizontal frequency: 15,625 Hz (15,750 Hz EIA).\n* Vertical frequency: 50 Hz (60 Hz EIA).\n\n(since I'm in the EU I presume it uses CCIR in favor of EIA)\n\nLooking at the board on the inside I notice that it uses an old-fashioned CRT (explains the \"noise\" when displaying the video) and a TDA8215B to decode the signal. This chip has \"COMPOSITE VIDEO SIGNAL INPUT CAPABILITY\" so I'm tempted to think that I only require to \"dedifferentiate\" the signal before using a general converter such as http://gembird.nl/item.aspx?id=7998\n\nAny insight and help is greatly appreciated. All-in-one solutions are preferable, but I'm able to solder some medium-sized components together.\n\n",

'If a square wave is passed to a spectrum analyzer and analyzed for its harmonic frequency components, up to which harmonic would it be safe to say that 80% of energy of the signal is captured?'\n\nIn other words what is the relation between harmonics and energy of signal?

        "text": "Edit: lambda/50 short length dipole for 1Ghz would be 30cm/50 = 6cm or 60mm leeway, which is pretty nice imo, lotta leeway there for shitty novice pcb layout. \n\nAlso turns out I just need to use youtube more\n\n[Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drwGvATLNaw) \n\n[others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5gGeV7CiQ0) \n\n[have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBNcTn9BEy0) \n\n[already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyU09OILXw) done this. And it turns out yes, yes you can. So for future readers I guess here you are. Now as for me, I just need to continue working. \n\n\nOriginal: \n\n\nHey anyone got any microwave prototyping suggestions? I want to try some typical Microwave Circuits 1 type of lab experiments. Total novice, I've only taken one class in Uni on antenna design. No TX line courses besides in EM II, no MW courses, no RFIC/MMIC courses.  \n\nI was looking into using \"pure\" copper boards from amazon, or the typical copper clad boards  you get on the cheap. They say they have 1oz copper and they use FR4 so should have decent dielectric constant and loss tangent. \n\nWhy not use OSH park? I mean because I'm cheap, impatient and lazy as hell. I want to SIM and design in hours, not days! \n\nOtherwise you can get various gauges of copper sheets on Amazon for pretty cheap. \n\nI was gonna do manhattan style construction. The nibbler tool I have does about ~3mm ish give or take nibbles length wise afaik. \n\nI was looking at the dielectric constant of hot glue, and wikipedia says even the cheapest hot glue sticks have some thermoplastics that when I then googled their funny long names seemed that they are quite RF friendly. \n\nSo copper - hot glue - copper construction. Big ground planes and all that jazz. Tolerances are obviously not precise, I need to calc skin effect and surface losses. \n\nI'm trying to do sub 1Ghz. I'm learning about RF circuits right now just for fun. I've got Pozar, Razavi and Lee all purchased and I do homework and SIM problems from different universities. I've read some papers on doing design work on all \"digital\" CMOS, either EPI or bulk vs specific RFCMOS PDKs. I know you can synthesize varactors in CMOS to a certain degree. I found that Silvaco PDK (0.24um) that uses some actual Foundry data and isn't just a GPDK and it has no NDA! But again I realize how layout dependent RF is, but I'm not too concerned with that, I just care about schematic design and using some vague round about numbers. obviously in RF that's not really possible but I'm not doing above 1GHz designs anyways. But hey it has Varactors, MIM caps and inductors! Otherwise I could use ASTIC and metal layers on something listed in the MOSIS SCMOS rules. \n\nAnyways I'm running on a tangent here.\n\nI'm starting my designs at the FM range (88 - 100 MHz) and doing some designs for a superhet FM receiver and a 40MHz ISM transmitter. Eventually I want to move on to Family Radio so I can do transmission without the FCC trying to knock down my doors and finally GSM. I'm literally too lazy to get a HAM radio license, otherwise I'd have used the 433MHz band. I'll attach my designs to an MCU with a decent speed ADC [described here](http://hforsten.com/cheap-homemade-30-mhz-6-ghz-vector-network-analyzer.html) to do the digital demodulation, or use an FPGA if necessary. But for quicker processing I'll be using the RTL SDR with direct sampling, and powered by the bias tee power given by the device itself. It enables me to do RF Link Budget analysis since it's a \"known good\" device, and I can solve problems similar to those in Razavi's book. \n\nI've synthesized Dipoles and Dipole Arrays, along with loop antennas in an advance EM class I had in undergrad. I was thinking of doing microstrip this time for the entire design, including the antenna. I have Balanis so I'm not too worried about theory. \n\nI want to do a very broad academic rewrite the wheel kind of deal. All on PCB. Traditional air core transformer vs planar aircore transformer (is that even possible), distributed vs lumped element, TX line analysis etc. Repeat the same high frequency analysis for CG-CD-CS/CC-CE-CB, typical diff amps and current mirrors, PA stages, tuned amps yadda yadda. It's doing the same exact design and simulation 6 different way essentially. \n\nI found that you can get Si &amp; SiGe BJT(HBTs), JFETs, DG-MOS, pHEMTs for all under $2 for the most expensive transistor (hint its the GaAs pHEMT)! Actually most are under a dollar! RF chokes, ferrites and the like aren't that expensive either. \n\nFor sub 1GHz for realizable prototype circuits, especially for a GSM transciever, can I do it without OSH park? \n\nBy the way I have QUCSStudio at home, and of course AppCad, LTSpice, Electric and the other usual free suspects. At school I can access NI AWR fairly easily, and Cadence Virtuoso/Spectre if I absolutely must.",

I have it hooked up, according to the datasheet, with a differential amplifier, providing 50x gain, following [this schematic at the top of the page](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_5.html). R3=R4=150k, R1=R2=3k.\n\n V1 TP1+ and V2 is TP2+. TP1- and TP2- are both grounded, HTR1 has 5V, HRT2 is grounded. Running off of 5V from an Arduino. While troubleshooting, I switch V1 and V2 around just to see what would happen, and still got 0V.\n\nFed the output of the differential amplifier into A0 of the Arduino and it's a constant 0V, no matter what flow of water I push through the sensor. Any ideas? One thought I had was that 50x gain was too much. However, I'm feeding the sensor significantly lower flow rates than what it's rated to handle.\n\nI'm confident that my circuit is hooked up correctly, but I am still troubleshooting it. \nI shorted something earlier but already replaced the op amp.\nI'm using an [OPA344](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa345.pdf).\n\nTomorrow I’ll be hooking up the individual TP lines to an oscope and seeing if any signal is coming off. I’m not sure if I’m saturating both lines and therefore getting 0 from the difference, or if both lines are blank from the start. Wondering if anyone else has troubleshooting ideas. ",

EE is a career change after 15 years in software development, including 7 years in management and 2 years as CEO of my company (I shut it down to go to school full time). I'll be 30 next month.\n\nI'm set on doing research in EE and am going for a master's, but I'm just not sure which research field to go for. I currently have two offers from two different professors. One is in analog RF microelectronics on building RF integrated circuits, and the other one is about integrating AI in RF/microwave EDA tools. I'm also very interested in the field of CEM (computational electromagnetics) as I love anything related to a lot of math, but I wouldn't know what my contribution to research in that field would be about.\n\nI was wondering if there is any field in EE that could benefit from more research, which involves heavy use of math, physical phenomena, and potentially RF/microwave circuits/structures. I know CEM covers just that, and I've seen a lot of papers on cellphone radiation effects on human body, or even frequency selective structures for military use, or antenna interactions in a distributed environment. These are wildly varying applications of CEM and I would have no idea which research area to pursue. I do enjoy anything with air, space and military applications and anything to do with telecommunications.\n\nAny tips or leads would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
