He concluded with a tweet calling the investigation into Russian interference in the election and his campaign’s possible involvement a “witch hunt,” asking, “when does it end?”\n\nAssuming that the article is accurate, I have two questions:\n\n1) Are there any legal grounds for any actions against Trump?\n\n2) If so, what are those grounds, and what actions can be taken?",

        "text": "Here's a relevant excerpt from the hearing's [transcript](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/13/full-text-jeff-session-trump-russia-testimony-239503). I apologize for its length, but I think the context for this question is important:\n\n&gt;SEN. MARTIN HEINRICH: Attorney General Sessions, has the president ever expressed his frustration to you regarding your decision to recuse yourself?\n\n&gt;SESSIONS: Senator Heinrich, I'm not able to share with this committee private communications --\n\n&gt;HEINRICH: You're invoking executive privilege.\n\n&gt;SESSIONS: I'm not able to invoke executive privilege. That's the president's prerogative.\n\n&gt;HEINRICH: My understanding is that you took an oath, you raised your right hand here today and you said that you would solemnly tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And now, you're not answering questions. You're impeding this investigation, so my understanding of the legal standard is that you either answer the question. That's the best outcome. You say this is classified, can't answer it here. I'll answer it in closed session. That's bucket number two.\n\n&gt;Bucket number three is to say I'm invoking executive privilege. There is no appropriateness bucket. It is not a legal standard. Can you tell me why what are these long-standing DOJ rules that protect conversations made in the executive without invoking executive privilege?\n\nSESSIONS: Senator, **I'm protecting the president's constitutional right by not giving it [executive privilege] away before he has a chance to review it.**\n\nHEINRICH: You can't have it both ways.\n\nSESSIONS: And second I am telling the truth in answering your question and saying **it's a long-standing policy of the department of justice to make sure that the president has full opportunity to decide these issues.**\n\nHEINRICH: Can you share those policies with us. **Are they written down at the Department of Justice?**\n\nSESSIONS: **I believe they are.**\n\nHEINRICH: This is the appropriateness legal standard for not answering congressional inquiries.\n\nSESSIONS: That's my judgment that it would be inappropriate for me to answer and reveal private conversations with the president when he has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer, one. There are also other privileges that could be invoked. \n\nI have three questions regarding this transcript:\n\n1) Does Heinrich's point about the \"truth\" oath have any legal merit in compelling Sessions to answer the question? In other words, is Session's refusal to answer a legal violation of that oath? Or is Heinrich's invocation of the oath simply political theater?\n\n2) Sessions is refusing to answer the questions because the President may invoke Executive Privilege in the future. He cites two justifications to back him up: the Constitution (\"I'm protecting the president's **constitutional right** by not giving it [executive privilege] away before he has a chance to review it\") and \"a long-standing policy of the Department of Justice.\"\n\n2a) Is Session's citation of the Constitution correct for his justification to refuse answering the Senator's questions?\n\n2b) Is Session's citation of \"a long-standing policy of the Department of Justice\" correct for his justification to refuse answering the Senator's questions?\n\n2c) Is that policy available for the public?

        "text": "There is a debate in the USA about whether or not we should have a larger welfare state that provides services like \"Medicare for all\" or tuition free college. Scandinavia is often brought up as an example showing that \"social democracy\" or a \"welfare state\" is a good or ideal system, with these countries having achieved high levels of equality, low levels of poverty, and good outcomes in terms of education, health, and happiness (source: http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/index.html). \n\nThere are several counter arguments that I have heard in opposition to expanding the welfare state: \n1. The success these countries have experienced was due to their policies 50+ years ago when they had a smaller welfare state and low taxes and as a result experienced rapid growth\n2. The welfare state has led to economic stagnation and high levels of national debt in these countries. \n3. The people in these countries have strong Protestant values of hard work and honesty and this is the true source of their success.\n(sources: https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/02/18/bernie-sanders-scandinavian-utopia-is-an-illusion/#16e253e11aab and https://beinglibertarian.com/scandinavia-ticking-time-bomb/)\n\nI've tried searching for a neutral analysis of the issue, but every article I've seen argues that the socialist policies are either wonderful or terrible (examples: https://www.thenation.com/article/after-i-lived-in-norway-america-felt-backward-heres-why/ and https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/bernie-sanders-nordic-countries/473385/ vs. http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438331/nordic-democratic-socialist-model-exposing-lefts-myth). What evidence supports each view? Is there an objective way of determining whether more socialist or more libertarian (perhaps what Europeans call neo-liberal?) policies have been the most beneficial?",

        "text": "Polarity is a term used to describe the balance of power among the world's nations.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_(international_relations)\n\nDuring the Cold War, the world was often described as [bipolar](http://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/55c09dcc-a9f2-45e9-b240-eaef64452cae/1dc7e103-8078-45e1-b8ac-2199a9be5783), that is split between two superpowers. This led to [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars#Cold_War_proxy_wars) although the number of deaths from war continuously [dropped](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/) after 1950.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, some have suggested the world has become unipolar, with one great superpower (the USA) [dominating the world](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/stability-unipolar-world) from economic, military, technological, and geopolitical standpoints, a level of global domination never before matched and likely to withstand many challenges.\n\nHowever, in the three decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union and following U.S. involvement in anywhere from two to five Middle Eastern conflicts (depending on how you measure 'involvement'), [isolationism](https://www.ft.com/content/c598ba32-d1a1-11e5-92a1-c5e23ef99c77) is making a comeback in the U.S., and recent presidential candidates have given at least lip service to the U.S. considering dedicating fewer resources to [global stability](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/whats-trumps-position-on-nato/) and avoiding the U.S. getting involved in [foreign conflicts.](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/04/07/sanders-warns-trump-against-dragging-us-another-endless-quagmire)\n\nThis has led some to call the modern world [multipolar](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32427364), that is, lacking in any single superpower that can force other countries to comply.\n\nWhat are the benefits and drawbacks globally, for any one country, and for the dominant country(ies) in any one of these scenarios?",
