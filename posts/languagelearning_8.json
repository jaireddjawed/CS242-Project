        "text": "I've been using memrise to learn vocabulary for about 10 years (maybe half of the time as a premium user) and I'm over it. There are a few things that might contribute to this. The last year or two I've been bored with learning languages overall (but I feel like I'm getting back into it now). But I think the main problem is the spaced repetition model of memrise.\n\nIf you have just learned a word, you will get it shown again after a day. Then after three, then after seven and so on. But that is capped at 180 days, iirc. So if you have, like me, tens of thousands of words on memrise, you always have words to review, even if it's worthless reviewing words you already know very well. Because of this, there is no time to learn new words after reviewing learned words.\n\nI also think the content on memrise ironically dropped in quality after they pivoted to officially made courses. Back in the day everyone could upload courses and vocab lists until they switched to a system where they created courses themselves. This lead to greater standardisation, which is great. Plenty of the user-generated courses had weird stuff like including \"m\", \"f\" or \"n\" after the word to indicate gender, but I digress. The official content is kinda basic. It might teach the most important words, but it stops there. Back in the day I used Icelandic vocab lists that had basically all the words, including stuff like \"orca\" and \"RAM\" which you rarely see in language learning ressources, but will have to learn eventually if you become fluent.\n\nI also dislike that they include phrases. Sometimes they are really complicated and long and are tedious to put in, even if you know all the words. So it gets even more annoying to review the stuff you already now. Sometimes they don't accept different but valid ways of phrasing things... Point is: I wish they stuck to just vocab.\n\nNow I'm looking for a new way to learn vocab. What are you using? Is Anki the way to go?",

        "text": "As someone who's active in the cooperative community, I've been wondering how language teachers would feel about working at a cooperatively run language school, owned by the teachers themselves.\n\nIn many countries, a few big players dominate the market for private language classes. They are quite expensive, but don't pay the teachers the wages they deserve. When it comes to the online platforms these big companies provide, they often don't even work that well.\n\nA co-op is a legal structure for companies owned and managed by the people who work there. Profits are either re-invested into the co-op or payed out equally among its members. Business decisions are made democratically, which means everyone has a say in how the cooperative is run.\n\nIn Europe, we have a special kind of co-op structure called an SCE (\"Societas Cooperativa Europaea\"), which makes it possible for any EU citizen to become a member of the cooperative. Since language lessons can take place entirely online, a European language teachers co-op could be run without physical class rooms, and with teachers from all over Europe.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this? Are there maybe problems I'm overlooking? I'm curious to hear what language teachers think about this topic.",

It’s far easier and more pleasant than attempting typical speaking tasks from the get go.\n\nThis has the advantage of evidencing the status of your active vocabulary as compared to natural text, so you won’t have to worry as much that you’re unconsciously restricting yourself only to the words you know.\n\nYou also get to speak in complex sentenece structures that may not have occurred to you naturally.",

It is hard to produce good videos. Ridiculously hard.  \nNot everyone can be a J.K. Rowling or a Steven Spielberg or even just a Danielle Steel.\nSuch talents are so rare, it's one in millions.  \n\nThe likelihood that a writer or videomaker of such talent works for a language-learning app company is basically zero. \nThey also can't just put the whole 'Harry Potter' in their app, it would be illegal. And they cannot just buy the usage rights for good content. It wouldn't be profitable. \n\nAll they can do is let the user do the work; e.g. have an \"import ebook\" button. \nBut this is already two steps removed from Duolingo candy or what any average user would ever consider doing. You'd have to buy the ebook and audiobook from somewhere else, remove the DRM or obtain it illegally, or even manually sync the text of the ebook with the audiobook, etc.\n\nSo most language-learning apps are basically doomed from the get go; simply because they fail by design to give us what we need the most: compelling content.",

        "text": "Today I have reached 1006.5 hours of Spanish Comprehensible Input with half of it coming from Dreaming Spanish so far. I started this journey on 5/31/22 and have put in 238 consecutive days of CI with an avg. viewing of 4.23hrs/day. I try to do 5hrs a day but when I first started I had to build up to it, which knocked my avg down a bit. You can read more about my early journey in these 2 threads I made… \n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nThis was at [95hrs + I comment with an update at 245hrs](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/w6pvrq/95_hours_of_comprehensible_input_and_im_about_to/)\n\nThis was at [700hrs](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/102xlk7/end_of_year_goal_reached_700_hours_of/)\n\n**QUICK UPDATE OF WHERE I'M AT**\n\nBefore making this thread, I did some quick listening to a DELE B1, B2, and C1 test so I can try and give a somewhat concrete comprehension level of where I may be at. Now, this shouldn’t be taken as anything definitive as this was all done half-assed and is probably not the best indicator since I only did 1-2 tareas but hey it’s something. I went to YT and found some exam demos from what look like legit channels that have services to prep people for the exams. I did the 1st tarea for B1 and got 5/6 right. I then did the 1st tarea for B2 and get 3/6 lol but I also tried the 2nd tarea and got a 6/6. I was not used to the formats of these exams and had no idea what to expect or how to really do them. Then for shits and giggles, I did the C1. I could understand an ok amount when I focused on what was being said but they also had a word bank to use to fill in the missing words for several sentences. I was kind of all over the place trying to figure out wtf was going on because this format was way different than the B1 and B2 exams. So I failed that one with flying colors haha but maybe if I really focused on it and got familiar with how they do the exam, I could do better.  \n\nAnyway, that’s the best I can give right now otherwise I have trouble really knowing what my levels are because it still fluctuates a lot depending on several variables. Also, for my passive listening, I usually have a native Spanish twitch stream on while I do other work but I am noticing that I am recognizing and understanding a lot more of what’s being said than when I first started, which all sounded like gibberish.  \n\n**WHAT HAPPENED AFTER 700hrs**  \n\nI wanted to reach 900hrs before I moved on to the advanced videos so I finished all of the How To Spanish, Spanishland School (everything that wasn’t direct grammar), Spanish Con Juan B1, and the majority of his videos in general (I have about 70 left w/ most coming from his B2 playlist), and a bunch of other intermediate CI channels. Out of all the content I watched, How To Spanish gave me the most varied comprehension where some videos were 90%+ and others were 70%’s, and of course everything in between. I think maybe it was the various topics that I wasn’t always familiar with, the vocab, and dialect. But everything else my comprehension was fine. They had about 80hrs of content and looking at their channel now, there are only 7 videos I haven’t watched since they came out after I finished. I just listened to about 5 minutes of one and I can definitely tell my comprehension and listening is much better than it was when I was back at 700. So that feels kind of good.  \n\nUnfortunately, I only made it to about 870hrs and I’ve been following the Dreaming Spanish OG method chart pretty closely and have held off on reading. It says at 600hrs it’s optional and at 1000hrs it’s recommended. So at 870hrs, I decided to start incorporating it into my daily CI and see how it goes. My initial plan was to watch 3hrs of DS, 1hr of a native youtube, and 1hr of reading. As I started getting closer to 1000hrs, I began to notice that I was losing focus more and more during my sessions. There was some life stuff going on and I tend to dwell on shit a lot, so I was constantly encountering reminders during my viewing, which caused me to drift off thinking about it. It also started to create some negative thinking and feelings of not wanting to do this anymore. I was getting tired of it. I think with all the hours I had been putting in and everything going on that I was teetering on burnout. And a short break may be needed along with changing up my routine so that I can make it through the next leg of this journey.  \n\n**THE PLAN**  \n\nNow that I have reached the big milestone of 1000hrs, I am planning on taking a break for a few days starting Thursday and possibly into the weekend in hopes of a mental reset. It won’t be a full clean break as I don’t fully trust myself from just saying fuck it and giving up, so I’ll just be watching a mindless telenovela where I’ll try and enjoy the “plot” lol. When I return, I plan to do only 2hrs of DS and increasing my reading to 2hrs. I will also be doing some formal studying/review from a textbook for an hour to try and solidify things. I don’t plan to memorize conjugation tables, rules or make flash cards or anything like that. I’m just going to read through it bit by bit and maybe do an exercise or 2 and move on. I’m also going to be changing the native streamer/vlogger type of content to just native television shows because I think my mind is fried from the CI format of just a single person talking on screen.  \n\nWith the reading, I’ve really been enjoying it, even though the “books” are short and the topics are somewhat boring. After I get finish this massive set (it’s about 1200 books and I’m almost halfway through), I plan to move onto chapter books. Unfortunately, I haven’t had any epiphanies or ah-ha moments yet in regards to recognizing patterns and/or format of the language or anything like that. Idk, maybe I’m just stupid. I’ve been using a countdown timer set for 1hr and maybe I’m not really giving myself time to fully absorb and observe how the language is being written. Not sure. Any thoughts/tips?  \n\nIt’s also another reason why I want to go through an actual textbook. I watched some of the Spanishland grammar videos and I couldn’t help but think, “how the fuck am I going to pick up some of these more complex concepts strictly through CI?”. I should probably throw in some grammar review. Also, because when Andrea is giving Nate sentence examples to translate into Spanish, I can’t really do it. I completely understand what the sentences are in Spanish if they were said or written, but I wouldn’t be able to produce them myself. So that has me a little concerned. However, someone told me that we’re only good at what we practice and I haven’t done any talking at all, so I can’t really be too hard on myself but it still feels a little shitty. Every now and then I’ll say some stuff to myself but it’s nothing really complex and on occasion, I do have Spanish words pop into my head instead of their english equivalent, which I guess is something. But overall, I just don’t feel like I’m ready to start speaking yet and my silence period will most likely be longer.  \n\nI also need to get these arbitrary numbers out of my head and thinking that once they’re reached I’m gonna suddenly be at such and such level and I have such and such capabilities. This is not helping me at all and I know I shouldn’t be comparing myself to others but it’s hard not to sometimes. I just need to keep reminding myself that I’m going to get there when I get there and hopefully changing things up it’ll help. I need to embrace the process. Easier said than done though bc I tend to be a negative thinker haha but I really do want this, even though it often feels like it’s going to take me forever lol.",

        "text": "I've been learning Russian on and off for the last couple of years. Due to inconsistency, I never achieved past A2. \n\nI recently started to consistently learn the language back in late November. I've been averaging 10 hours a week of self study and 3 hours with tutors every week for the past 13 weeks. \n\nI recently had an exercise with one of my tutors where we both needed to express our thoughts on a certain topic. I had a little trouble fully understanding her at some points and had to ask her to repeat slowly. This isn't abnormal for me. Afterwords, when I had to express my thoughts, I couldn't think of anything to say. I can usually speak impromptu on many topics fine but today I couldn't. This left me a little demoralized like I'm doing something wrong or I'm an imposter. \n\nThis got me thinking maybe I'm not studying effectively.\n\n\nMy self-study routine consists of the following:\n\n* 6 hours reviewing vocabulary on Quizlet/Babbel. I add words I don't understand from tutoring sessions here as well. \n* 2 hours doing homework from tutoring sessions \n* 1 hour reviewing grammar (cases, conjugation, imperfective/perfective, etc.)\n* 1 hour having imaginary conversations in my head (this sounds weird, but it allows me to identify words I don't know through conversation)\n\nI'll also sometimes listen to songs I like or watch children cartoons in my target language when I'm tired of grinding out vocabulary flashcards.\n\nAnd of course, three one-hour tutoring sessions a week which mostly consists of conversating, listening to audio, grammar exercises, new topics/words, etc. I have two different tutors for this.\n\nIs there something I can do better or any general advice at all? I plan to continue this routine till the end of the year and re-evaluate. My goal is at least to get to B2 which I understand is more than a year away from where I am currently. I think I'm between A2 and B1 now. I just want to study as effectively as possible.",

I’ve already got my native romance language to help me learn French (with which I’m also somewhat familiar) Italian or Spanish; yet maybe I should focus on German instead. I’m also experimenting with Esperanto at the moment and questioning myself whether it is even useful as a preparatory language for learning another future european language quickly.

If I listen to history podcasts I'm learning new things constantly but I never feel the same exhaustion I do from listening to a podcast, regardless in level, in my TL.\n\nWhy is this? Is it simply that hearing the words spoken in my native language makes my brain comfortable enough that it doesn't care that it's not absorbing every single thing it hears? Is it me thinking that even when listening to something simple I feel the need to focus on every single word?\n\nEither way are there ways around this to make it more of a relaxing experience that doesn't cause such exhaustion?",

Tends to spray saliva inadvertently. \n\nA2: Can successfully avoid getting arrested or doing anything outrageously stupid, illegal, or unusual in public. Can occasionally read menus. Prefers shorter menus with lots of pictures. \n\nB1: Makes use of a highly precise, highly limited vocabulary. Can order  food, talk with people, and make love as long as the sexual partner is not  too demanding in the target language. Can start to watch things that he/she would enjoy *if* the language level were higher.\n\nB2: Can watch everything that he/she would enioy if the language level were higher. Watches Netflix bitterly, scribbling notes and making flash cards without actually enjoying anything. Lives out every day a joyless, humdrum existence. Can communicate thoughts, emotions, and feelings, though none of  them very complex. Can come off as slightly dull among educated native speakers, but still comes off.\n\nC1: Can officially be annoying in the target language. Possesses a  vocabulary broad enough to confuse people on purpose, play tricks, or  otherwise scare them. Can order food, then ask to have it sent back. Can apologize in different registers. Enjoys only half of what he/she watches or consumes, since the other half is spent trying to understand  why it's not 100% understandable. C1 isn't all it's cracked up to be. \n\nC2: Can officially be pretentious in the target language. Can annoy people  with formal registers that are used in the wrong context. Can speak like  a thickly accented professor. Hates being called foreign. Wishes to be a  native speaker, feels excluded, and occsaionally writes frustrated  missives in the native language that are then answered in the target  language. Can understand and enjoy mostly everything. Does not get  arrested, unless that is his/her intention. Can hold his/her own in a police interrogation, unless otherwise compelled by emotions, feelings, or strong desires that demand otherwise. Can express anger and outrage in an idiomatic way.",

My classmates won't take things seriously so it's difficult to practice with them and that makes things even harder.\n\n\nSorry for this long post, I assure I'm not trying to rant. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "I have been learning Spanish for 55 days now through Duolingo. I spend anywhere from an hour to two hours a day on the app. Reading advice and articles on the best techniques to learn a language almost always has the same advice, use more than one source. This is almost always followed by examples such as podcasts, tv and YouTube videos in your goal language. My problem is I’m not sure at what point I should be branching off of Duolingo to use other sources. I can recognize some words when Spanish is being spoken however it’s usually with subtitles on. I know 55 days is not a lot and I know I shouldn’t expect to be able to understand Spanish conversations but if I don’t understand 99% of what I’m listening to is it still worth it even this early on? Thanks for any advice",

Around 4 years ago I started consuming English content through YouTube/Music, which eventually led me to learn it. I'm not sure how I learned it but I suppose it was through that constant exposure that my brain learned it. Recently I've been wondering, what if I go ahead and try the same approach with french? Would it be possible to learn french just by watching a shit-ton of videos, music, and reading a bunch of books and comics?   \nEven if this approach would work, would it be more efficient to do it this way or just learn the language for multiple hours a day? \n\nThanks in regards",

The 'News' category is a free product (account required, but no cost). You can adjust the reading levels from around 550L and higher. The L is for the Lexile score - rough translation to CEFR is 550L is about A2, 750L is about B1, 950L B2, etc. You can toggle in the window and the text will adjust, so you can determine for yourself. \n\nEasy import into Lingq as well.
