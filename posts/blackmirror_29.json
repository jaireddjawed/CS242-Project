        "text": "This show is amazing. Almost every episode is thought provoking and leaves me speechless at the end, so much so that I browse the discussions on the subreddit after every episode. \n\nI just finished the first episode of Season 4 \"USS Callister\" and honestly I'm utterly disappointed and left with a sour taste in my mouth. Aside from the blatant plot holes, I hate how the episode ended. Although Daly was a sociopath and what he did to the sentient AI was borderline cruel, I sympathized with him. The way he was killed off in the end was so stupid, an intern AI can find all these loopholes and hack the system but the creator of the game cannot? \n\nI feel like the only way this episode would make sense, and perhaps I missed this at first, is that the episode was satire like The National Anthem or The Waldo Moment. The episode mirrors how a lot of shows today have the protagonists win, no matter the plot holes or circumstances. Even though the protagonists are against this all powerful being who's basically playing God, they still prevail through a series of luck and dumb plot holes. \n\nMaybe I missed something, because USS Callister is clearly one of the fan favorites. Anyone else have similar thoughts?",

It's been a frequent talking point for reviewers, but even when listened to in isolation, it makes for a beautiful accompaniment to just about anything. My favorite track is probably \"The Journey, Not the Destination\" for the transition from the serene intro to the electronic second half (and the clever use of the \"downvote\" sound) but the first and last tracks are absolutely breathtaking, and are very nice to study with.\n\n[Here's the Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/6I3nSno00gBaLTJF4epBQY?si=rYbSZUPZRkKDCYOJHaQ6zQ) to the soundtrack.

Do you think Charlie Brooker wanted us to view Garret as an anti-hero rather than a villain? The whole episode is about how people should pay the consequences for mean behavior on the Internet. I don't think Brooker literally thinks people who post mean tweets deserve to die, but I think he was making a point by suggesting that the terrorist probably got away with what he did.",

Work is done online, social interaction happens online, everything one needs can be delivered really quickly straight to one's door. What happens when there is absolutely no need to get out of home?\n\nAutomation - in every field. The majority of the people don't have jobs, and no more jobs can be created. How do they keep an income? How do they spend time? Does the large population create problems? (I have never understood how Black Mirror episodes have empty lands, when the world population continues to grow exponentially).\n\nUltimate happiness - there is precise scientific research to show what makes a person happy, and people now live in a society where sadness/sorrow/anger/any negative emotion can be fixed in a snap either with medication or neuroscientific technology.

        "text": "Spoilers for White Bear\n\nI apologize in advance if this has already been said, but there's a few things that stood out to me since I looked at it knowing what happens. I'm a new fan and White Bear was one of the first episodes I watched and loved it the first time. Many of these things hint at the ending.\n\n1. Victoria must stink to high heaven. All of the actors in contrast look like they took a shower and had time to dress in the morning. Victoria does not change her clothes or take a shower during the day.\n\n2. The whole gas station scene. They rely on the host to shoot out the tires and break the glass and replace it for the next day. The operating costs must be absurd. Victoria shows her passive maliciousness by not trying to save him when he's wrestling with the host. They showed moments when she could've helped, but she chose a more self serving route.\n\n3. Victoria has no reason to trust the actors. I was pretty suspicious of them the first watch, but had nothing concrete to say. I don't expect her to notice all of these things, but at least some of them.\n\nFirst, she's told that the tattoo on the screens brainwash everyone, yet when Victoria goes off script and sees a phone screen, it doesn't have the tattoo on it. She's also threatened with a taser which is presented as for her own safety. But, I saw Victoria as dead weight for her team when I was watching the first time.\n\n(I believe) she was told anyone could be a hunter and lure them into a false sense of security, but still trusts this girl dragging her around and into a van with a stranger.\n\nShe previously had ESP (her unerased memories) about something happening in the woods and of the host, yet enters the facility that she had memories of.\n\nThere's a lot of awkward pauses for killers. That woman hunter with the handheld chainsaw reached the van window and could've smashed it open. When Victoria was in the woods alone, the host took a really long time with the drill, waiting for the actress to show up.\n\nShe doesn't seem totally on board with the actress as evidenced by her fixation on the tattoo while the actress is using lighter fluid to light the place. Side note: the jig is up when the hunters arrive, why make them stab the girl?\n\n4. Why doesn't Victoria try to brainwash herself? The hunters are not targeted by the brainwashed people. And, it seems a hell of a lot better way to live than on the run constantly. It's explained that she's somehow immune, but it was explained to her that she could be brainwashed looking at the phone.\n\n5. The people that are crucified in the woods. They're being hung from their arms alive and without a platform to stand... Ow!!\n\n6. Why are there so many goddamn audience members? Victoria must not have been at the park that long if they're putting up that many people violently angry at her. She suffers the torture every day, but it would be more believable if she suffers it once or twice a week and that many people come.\n\n\n\nAlright I've gone on far too long.",

There's something perverse about creating an entire complex, putting so much resources into making one person's existence a living hell, even if they did something unspeakably bad.\n\nI also think encouraging sadistic and hateful feelings towards the guilty makes people less empathetic towards the innocent and brutalizes a society, because people start getting \"high\" on the feeling.

They should have weened him safely.\n\nAlbeit birth probably isn't a good pain for weening. More like indulgence pain.",

Upon second viewing, what bothered me the most was that there was literally no due process of law. Obviously joe isn't a bad dude, he didn't necessarily mean to kill the old man, it was more of a crime of passion. His wife died and after years of thinking he had a kid he finds out it's not even his. Trents punishment seems to be really extreme too. All he did was try to help awkward young guys to get girls, and he accidentally witnessed a murder and didn't want to get caught up in it. Blocked by everyone forever it really extreme, and why the hell did the police woman just issue the punishment to him so easily? Are there no judges? Are there no courts? Lawyers? Why is there literally no justice system in this? Even if we could get confessions from AI i feel like we can't just get rid of due process of law. I'm sure this has been said before but this is what just got me thinking after watching. ",
