        "text": "Hi, to start off im 18 and was raised non religious, my dad is atheist and my mum believes in a god but follows no religion. I have only been to church a handful of times and all the times that I can remember where because of a school trip or christmas concert. I was born with multiple genetic defects that affects my mothers side of the family and some of the things I have been diagnosed with where PDD (basically aspergers) Anxiety (I cant remember if it was severe anxiety or not) OCD and in the past 2 years I have been diagnosed with depression. And other physical problems.\n\nSo all this started about 2 years ago when I came across fundamentalist conspiracy websites that were claiming things like the illuminati, evolution is a lie and all non believers are gonna burn in hell etc... So I became obsessed with this stuff and spent most if not all of my free time looking at videos about this and websites online and I became a nervous wreck. I would cry to myself while reading these and I had a few panic attacks because of it.\n\nMy parents decided to take me to a doctor and I was then put on anti depressants and refered to a mental health specialist. They didn't do much for me and when I turned 18 I was transfered to the adult mental health service. (I turned 18 in april and im still waiting)\n\nI overcame my fear of conspiracys like the illuminati and things like that and for a while I was over my fear of religion. But it keeps coming back. I have looked at arguments for and against God and while I find the arguments against god more convincing I cannot shake this fear.\n\nNow to the main point, while watching a video on apologetics the person said I could just ask God to show himself to me and we could settle this argument right now and we would have no need for apologetics. So I decided to pray and ask God to show himself to me. a couple minutes later I started to feel warmish in my chest and then I started becoming really anxious.\n\nAnyone been through something like this at all or has any advice?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n",

Most people are just curious and I am capable of keeping myself in check because I'm used to people being in a bit of disbelief. However, recently, my boss and I talked and he did not exactly take it well, questioning me and throwing arguments about evolution at me. I did my best to keep my composure, but part of me was incredulous. I have a bachelors degree in biology, of which evolution is a founding principle. Yet he tried to explain to me about DNA and his misunderstandings of the evolution of humanity. I didn't say anything because I knew if I started that things would get heated. But I'm worried that I never should have said anything and that now we'll never have the same kind of relationship as we did before. I accept him for his beliefs and I think he's a good person- I just wish he would do the same for me. How do I cope with all of this?",

        "text": "My friend has been brought up in a Christian household and always believed he was a Christian until 2 years ago when he started getting into the drug scene and smoking and drinking. He led his life like that up until this point, and never once believed in god, he even told me he sometimes felt sorry for religious people as their faith was so obviously delusional (not my opinion or words). However, a few days ago he suddenly came to me (only a day after we'd been drinking together with friends) and told me he'd had an 'encounter' with God, and has now decided to give up everything that God deems bad and to live the rest of his life for Jesus. He described his experience as something spiritual, and says it happened when he believed he was going to die from an epileptic fit. \n\nI'm a firm believer in that I will believe what I, personally, experience; and therefore cannot fathom the idea that what happened to him is real. His whole personality changed in under a day, and while I do believe that he did experience something, I cannot bring myself to believe it's what he thinks it is. \n\nMy first thought is that this could be some kind of mental disorder, and looking into it, I have come to highly believe that this whole situation is a form of schizophrenic delusion. He's suffered from phsychosis before, when he would hear voices and have hallucinations, and he's constantly had issues with anxiety and depression. To add, he's always had a low image of himself, and often felt that drugs, alcohol and smoking were enslaving his free-will, and he always had a sightly difficult time dealing with this. \n\nThis all fully leaves me to believe that this is a delusion he has created for himself to try and make up for the things he's done in the past he deems wrong, but I was hoping to get some different opinions on the situation. I understand that if it is a delusion, there is nothing I can do or say to him, I'm just overall worried how he would cope with this if he ever came to his senses on the whole situation. \n\nAny advice or input into what you make of the whole situation would be highly appreciated.\n\n[UPDATE] I've been in contact with a mental health helpline and they've suggested trying to get him to seek medical help, and if that's impossible to just support him and make sure he doesn't do anything that could potentially hurt him. I'm going to follow this as I think that despite the fact that his new belief will help him overcome his addictions, I don't want to risk it if theres a possibility of him having something seriously medically wrong with him. I don't want to risk the chance of him being seriously ill, just because it will help some aspects of his life. ",

The other 5% have really strong faith, or suffer more from a mental illness. I do not know. \n\n\"The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent ... \" ‚Äî Stanley Kubrick. I believe it is a common theme among atheists, more so than theists, and for obvious reasons, that we realize how indifferent the universe truly is. It is, in fact, one of the many reasons that people 'became' atheists. However, I choose not to tell people about my lack of faith because I don't want them to come to the conclusion earlier that the universe is a cruel, yet dark and indifferent place. If religion comforts most of us, then damn me to take away that comfort, unless religion is a big source of suffering in our world. It is a heavy realization, and for a long time, a burden to bear and one that I hope will be easier on future, more advanced, societies. \n\nBut what other comforts are there that equal that of religion, to which we can turn if we no longer have religion? Does it have to be forced? How important, exactly, is it to realize the truth of reality? That's an honest question that I have. \n\nIt is kind of silly, in retrospect, that we assume it to be otherwise, but that much is set in stone. It is to be expected if we look back into our ancestral and evolutionary (tautological?) past, almost like every other observation we make about humans and society today. But it is still the case, and it would be, in my opinion, blind arrogance to think otherwise.\n\nI get anxious when it becomes night for this very reason, and have yet to overcome this fact.

        "text": "I have been dealing with a growing distaste and even rarely a kind of hatred of other atheists who, in my view, fall victim to modern liberalism and become just as engrossed in faith based ideologies as they were when they were religious, if they ever were. Trying to put these ideas down in writing has been spurred by my recent events in my own life and those in the real world. \n\nThere has been recently a brewing fight for free speech, individuality, and freedom. Things that we all say that we value when asked directly about them, but many of us betray ourselves with the policies we push and the ideas we advocate for. Historically atheists have been associated with very left wing ideas, and as we all know we get lumped in with and associated with some of the most grievous crimes in the 20th century like what happened in the USSR, Nazi Germany, and Mao's China. And while we don't see atheists advocating for fascism or communism we do see them on average, inexplicably in my view, driven to the left on almost every issue political issue today.\n\nSome of it can be explained by a rejection of the religiousness often associated with the right, and with conservatism, however I don't think that fully explains the lockstep that most atheists find themselves in with the modern left on everything from economics to social issues. And even worse than being lockstep they hold many of those beliefs without knowing why they are good beliefs to have. Something that they lambast others for.\n\nIt's not like I don't get the drive towards the left. I became aligned a lot more with modern liberalism when I became an atheist. The move away from religion can be extremely stressful, depending on how serious you were about it. I didn't know what I was anymore and in a scramble for some semblance of order I found my self fully on board with ideas that I again had no basis for having. Things that I believed to be true that were just as based in ignorance as those ideas I had just escaped. Not to say that they were all wrong or bad, but then again neither were the religious ones.\n\nWestern culture has been on a path away from rationality and free thought for a long time, and whatever hope some of us might see in the rejection of religious ideas for secular ones is in fact being destroyed by the adherence to an even worse kind of dogma and new kind of faith based belief system. \n\nI think that we all need to get back to the basics of why things like freedom, individuality, consent, and free speech are so important. There are a few basic concepts that are true that we all need to learn, remember, and put into practice.\n\n1. As an individual we are the sole owner of our life and our body. No one else could possibly have a claim. Not a god and not a group of people.\n\n2. As an individual we are the sole person entitled to the fruits of our labor produced by sacrificing portions of our life, and our body via time spent doing a task. \n\n3. As an individual we have no right to anothers body, life, time, or work without their consent, or without them having violated our body, life, time, or work or that of another.\n\nThese are three fairly simple, seemingly non-controversial natural rights that all humans have, have always had, and will always have, and even exist cross species to a lesser degree. However, in practice people will infringe on these without even thinking twice.\n\nWhen you stop taking these truths seriously, and start fiddling with things like consent and freedom it always has very negative side affects. Not always horrific ones like the many we saw in the 20th century, but negative none the less.\n\nI guess more than anything I want to believe that atheists can escape this kind of trap that they seem to fall into. That leads them into a kind of automatic love of state power over individuals.\n\nTo head off some of the potentially likely criticism, I am not saying that modern conservatives are a bastion of rationality, and even if they happen to have some ideas in line with what I think we should all value, it is likely not because they have put any thought into it. It is more likely that they are just blessed by being born into a culture that valued those things, and they accepted them at face value. But just because they didn't arrive at those ideas rationally doesn't mean they aren't the right ideas and beliefs to have.\n\nI am not a republican. Nor am I perfect. I just want those of us who proclaim to love free thought and rationality and freedom and individuality to actually learn why we should love and protect those things, and in many cases learn what they actually are.\n\nThis may seem kind of an unusual or vague post, this is my second time posting it after a few changes suggested by the mods. I fully expect it to get the downvotes I received the first time I posted it, the ideas I am talking about are very broad in scope and often misunderstood when looking through the lens of our modern life to appreciate them for what they are. \n\nIf you want to respond I would appreciate a response on either the three truths I listed. How you think they are wrong, or if you object to their very existence. Or perhaps a single specific example where you think infringing on them is acceptable without a violation of the principles themselves occurring.\n\nOr if you don't want to respond to that perhaps talk about why you think atheists are drawn to modern liberalism. \n\n\n*To no one's surprise you all are all for lack of a better word... state worshippers. And heavily left leaning for no real reason. Below are a few videos to help expose you to different ways of thinking that will help you all understand some different points of view and perhaps challenge you to examine your beliefs. I recommend watching them in order though it doesn't really matter.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PGMQZEIXBMs\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fasTSY-dB-s\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_5PwQKW62to\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IFbYM2EDz40\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NbNFJK1ZpVg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jTYkdEU_B4o  \n\n",

I argue that choosing which parts of a religion to follow should be encouraged.\n\nA common criticism of Christianity is that followers ignore parts of the Bible that they don't like. I'm aware that Christianity requires belief in the entire Bible, so this practice may be internally inconsistent.\n\nEastern religion, specifically Buddhism which I practice, takes a different view. On the surface, Buddhism can look a lot like other devotional religions. Its followers pray to statues and have rituals. But more advanced practitioners know that stuff like that doesn't do anything. Buddha isn't up there listening.\n\nSo what are they doing? It's a teaching called [Upaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya), which allows practices that are not 'true' to be done anyway, if it benefits the person in some way. A [famous story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya#Parable_of_the_burning_house) illustrates this with a father lying to his children to get them out of a burning house. Practices like prayer can bring comfort and lead someone along the right path, so why stop doing them just because they aren't philosophically true? If a practitioner starts having doubts about prayer, they would quickly learn the truth and move on to a different practice. \n\nIt's a shame that Christianity discourages this. No reason to throw out lots of good teachings because there's also some nonsense mixed in. \n\nWhat do you think? It picking and choosing intellectually dishonest? Should we encourage it?",

Deduction from plausible premises is okay when it's all you have to go by, but it is preferable to have studies or experiments supporting an empirical claim like this.\n\nAnd I don't just mean picking and choosing the facts, but selecting them based on their actual evidential value. Christians can point to studies that allegedly show that religious people are happier if picking and choosing studies is allowed. That is merely prejudice under the guise of science.\n\nI consider this thread a preliminary to a more detailed investigation I plan to conduct. I have ordered some books, and I am reviewing some books I already own in order to remind myself of the evidence.",

        "text": "I have a question about those who claim to receive guidance from the supernatural. \n\nThere are some religious people who believe that they communicate with God in some way, shape, or form. They may claim that they pray to God, seeking guidance, or comfort, or support, and they claim that they feel these prayers are answered when they gain these feelings immediately after petitioning to God. I am of the belief that the person's subconscious is supplying these feelings of guidance, comfort, and support. \n\nThey may also claim that they hold direct conversations with him, in which they claim to actually hear God's voice inside their head. Again, I believe that the subconscious is answering them. \n\nThey may also claim to see \"signs\" from God in the outside world and believe them to be a form of guidance from him:\n\nLet's suppose that a religious person is contemplating whether she should divorce her husband or not. She prays to God, asking him to send him a sign. The next day, she walks outside, and sees a crow sitting on her roof. Crows tend to symbolize death, so she interprets this crow sitting on the roof of her household as a sign that if she stays with her husband, she will continue to suffer in the unsatisfactory relationship. As a result, she leaves him.\n\nMy question is: Did she leave her husband simply because of the fact that there was a crow on her roof? Surely her decision would be considered arbitrary if she did, and she would probably be considered crazy. Or did her subconscious already decide that she already did want to leave her husband, so she began interpreting everything as signs she should leave?\n\nIf the latter is true, then could it be that the religious and spiritualists are more in tune with their subconscious desires than atheists? \n\nThere are spiritualists who believe in Tarot cards. They may use them when they are seeking guidance on how to proceed in a certain situation. The cards are extremely vague and can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways, but the way the reader interprets the cards depends on how their subconscious wants them to proceed in that situation. So by looking at these cards, the reader does not gain supernatural insight, but rather insight into how one's subconscious wants them to proceed in the situation they are in. \n\nSo, again, are the spiritualists more in tune with their subconscious desires than atheists?\n\n",

        "text": "I came out to my mom today about my atheism. She took it about as well as I expected her to. She was a little upset not because I rejected her religion but because I don't at least believe in *something*. She's a Vietnamese Buddhist, and I, having lived most of my life with the American half of my family, was a Christian. She cited how I used to go to church and say my bedtime prayers, and she worried that I wouldn't have anywhere to go when I die. She believes that each person will go to the afterlife of their religion. I don't know how common these beliefs are among Buddhists, but it seemed odd to me.\n\nI'm a little upset that I upset her though. I don't know what's going through her mind or how she sees me now, and anyone who reads this probably knows less, but is there anything I can say or do to comfort her? Is there some fact about her religion that would shed some light on her reaction? I've already told her that I'm the same person, that my beliefs aren't unchangeable, and that I'll try to be the best person I can be regardless of religion.\n\nAnd also, she's the first person I've told, and, frankly, it's brought back some doubts and fears. It kind of feels like I'm officially a heathen now, like I'm certainly not going to *heaven*, even if I'm not going to hell either.",

Take out divine \"God created you specially\" supernatural stuffs and I'm left seeing that that specific fetus has formed is an incredibly improbable event.  \n  \nI remain pro-choice at the moment, but this is a thought that occurred to me. Any opinions on this?  \n  \nEdit: to add to this thought. There are people who have children after having an abortion because they're in a better place in life to care for one. That child may never have been born if the mother didn't get an abortion previously! Or maybe the pregnant woman who has an abortion because she's in med school later goes on to become a doctor who helps save someone else's child or help someone else with fertility issues. Those children wouldn't be alive if she hadn't gotten an abortion. IDK, thinking about this stuff is just interesting to me. Life is crazy. ",

This is what a testimony is after all: a story someone tells you. If a book is written in the format of a testimony thus you must not necessarily believe the narrator at all times. Sometimes you can assume that he is lying or exaggerating things just like a stranger telling you a story at a bar would. (Sorry for the long intro but it will help the rest of this make sense... hopefully) So following this logic and using its lens to examine the bible I make 3 assumptions as I read the accounts of Christs life.\n\n1 - Jesus is not divine and has no special powers. (ex. I've never seen a dude walk on water why would I believe a testimony that says someone saw someone do it somewhere.)\n\n2 - No one else has special powers everyone is a human limited by the knowledge and culture of Iron Age Middle East.\n\n3 - Jesus is corruptible just like every other person. \n\nNow with all this in play as I go through the bible I hear a story about a Iron age Rabbi that ran an organization with lots of hall marks of a cult like abandoning families to follow a holy teacher, giving up wealth, and dedicating one entire life soul, body, and mind to the holy teacher. Further this holy teacher showed them a bunch of cheap parlor tricks. The holy teacher was so narcissistic and egocentric that anytime anything other then him comes up he tells you how unimportant it is compared to him and tells you to give up everything just to worship him and serve him.\n\nFurther he is reckless and his delusions of grandeur like thinking he is himself a god as well as his corrupt nature like soaking himself in a years wages worth of perfume in one sitting in front of a bunch of people who gave everything up to obey and follow him. The picture is clear. I do not see a wise and loving guy. I see Charles Manson or Marshall Applewhite.\n\nMy analysis lead me to make this documentary about the life of Christ where I go into detail and develop my thesis from birth to crucifixion. If you care for such a thing here is a link. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6phUjAXqCT4 ",

        "text": "I need some advice... \n\nWhat do you do as a parent when the school your child is in is teaching them a religion you don't follow? I have a 3 year old daughter and live in a small community town in South Africa where there aren't any other schooling options and 99% of the community are Christians - so they probably just assume that so are we, though we're really atheists. BUT we are too afraid to be open about it out of fear of rejection and losing business (which we can't afford). Moving to a bigger city isn't feasible either right now.\n\nI can't ask the school to seperate my child when they practice religion, pray or sing and learn from the Bible because she won't understand, and I don't want her to feel different or \"out\" or be rejected by her peers. I also can't explain it to her, she's too young to understand. \n\nShe comes home and scolds me because I didn't pray before eating, or would sing songs about Jesus and recite prayers and Bible stories she learnt at school. I don't want her getting forced into religion like we were. I want her to make her own choices when she is capable of doing so. I feel like they are indoctrinating and brainwashing my daughter, while I'm helpless at stopping it.\n\nAny parents with similar experience? How does one handle it?",

        "text": "I wanted to title this The Cat Daddy in the Sky, but wasn't sure about the reception. A couple of weeks ago, something happened to my 3 year old indoor cat who has always been sick for unknown reasons. This older middle-aged lady started asking about him so we talked about our cats. My cat was laying in his carrier looking half dead when I lost it because the wait was long and I was scared he wouldn't make it. I started quietly crying in the waiting room. Then it happened - the fantastical stories about near death cats being saved by prayer, even without medical intervention. She adamantly said she believes in prayer, and my mom nodded along eagerly \"I do too.\" I didn't want any trouble, especially since I was a mess and my cat pisses himself if someone yells in anger because he's sensitive. So, I cringed inside as I allowed her to pet him, but then she started to pray for him like she was laying on hands. I knew that might happen and still cringe thinking about it. I was relieved when my cat got a blood transfusion, fluids, and steroids. It wasn't the end of his ordeal though, and people keep saying they will pray for him. I get that they're trying to be nice, but the religious preaching is not welcome. Two vets and five techs worked on him to save his life that day (it was a big ordeal...), and he had to return a few times before he's strong enough to test for what's wrong. I help him around the clock. My mom brings it up and gives a lot of credit to prayer that he's getting better (why do anything then?). She doesn't like that I'm atheist, and depending on the upcoming test results she'll probably claim a miracle like it's proof. I just want it to stop. I feel like asking why they think God cares more about cats than all of the horrible things humans do to each other, or people starving. It feels dirty. This is a bible belt area and I need some sanity. I have no way out right now and just want to enjoy whatever time my cat has left without religious input. I'm open to advice or witty comebacks to unwarranted proselytizing. I don't want to be outright mean, but shut down this process if possible. If it's not possible, maybe it can be entertaining? I have too much stress in my life.",

        "text": "I had a very amusing experience this morning which I would like to share.\n\nOn a Friday, myself and my colleagues sit down in a meeting room and have some coffee and bacon rolls and have a chat about any old thing (weekend plans, houses, sport, whatever).\n\nNow, I have worked with these guys for about 7 years, and despite that I frequently maintain that Scottish society is largely atheistic, I have never known what these guys think about religion, and I have never told them what I think.\n\nSomehow, today was the day that the elephant in the room was spoken about.\n\nIt started off with my boss's boss asking him whether the reason he swears so much is because of his northern Irish wife - to some amusement. Then he left for a meeting.\n\nThen the rest of us somehow got on to talking about how in Ireland church was a status thing, and how they publish the people who donate and size of donations,\n\nThen we were talking about whether we would move into a church as a house, and the common trend for converting churches into pubs and nightclubs.\n\nAnd then I'm not really sure what happened, but it was like the curtain dropped. In the previous conversation each of us (4 in total) had dropped subtle hints unintentionally that we weren't religious.\n\nMy boss came out with \"now, see I don't believe there is a god\"\n\nAnother said \"I mean, there definitely is no sky fairy\".\n\nThe other basically said \"Oh, aye\" in concurrence.\n\nEveryone in the room revealed themselves as atheists. \n\nI find it fascinating how this has never happened before - it's basically that we are terrified of saying what we think in case we offend or get into an argument with someone who does believe. But it hides our numbers - that's 100% of a sample of 4. What if I took a larger sample?\n\nI suspect that the number of atheists in the UK (particularly Scotland) must be far, far higher than is currently reported.\n\nI also think the relatively small group size helped with revealing our true opinions - less people in the room means less risk of your judgement about another person's beliefs being incorrect, less risk of conflict. Today most of our team were out of office so it was a much smaller group than usual.\n\nAn interesting morning though, to be sure.",

The book is 2001, and there have been many more findings since then to clarify what was really happening in the Real World Middle East from about 1500 BC to 70 AD, when the jews were scattered north, east, and south by the Romans.  \n  \nThe study is notable because, Finkelstein, a jewish archaeologist went in with the bias to prove the 'bible' was true and an absolute reference for Middle East history. The scientist in him won, and he started putting the evidence together as Real World bits of history, assembling the Real World history.  \n  \nSimply, there was a Kingdom of Judea but it only lasted a few hundred years, from 1,000 BC to 586 BC, when it was conquered, with no comeback. Archaeology is finding this old jewish kingdom was not following a male god, but a female goddess of fertility, associated with Ashereth, derived from the Sumerian Isis. They were following a pantheon, and there was a YWVH, whose name was so fearful to never be fully completed with vowels, except he was just a male war god.",

        "text": "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/archeology-hebrew-bible.html  \n  \nThe article in the link is from 2008 but it summarizes over a century of archaeology that set out to prove the 'bible' was factual and true. The idea of using the 'bible' as an archaeology 'reference' source is about 150 years old. It has only been a long time of objective science that is finding out most of the 'bible' is fictitious. There is an effort to separate the old testament from the new testament but the new testament depends on the old testament for validation. The fact that the old testament is proving to be fictitious and riddled with factual errors does weigh on the new testament credibility.  \n  \nThis has been going on for 1,500 years. The Vatican is the origin, the beginning of the Ioesus cult. Put as simply as possible, the Holy Roman Church, that became the Vatican, went on a memory wipe campaign, so that all of Europe was programmed to blindly believe that Adam, the First Jew, was their direct ancestor, and that their culture and pseudo-history was jewish. This specific idea of a supernatural anthropomorphic trinary-nature monotheistic god-man is a jewish belief system.  \n  \nWhere did christianity start? In Jerusalem? No, you are being told it started there. In the Real World, christianity started in the catacombs in the city of Rome, around 60 AD. That is the \"beginning\". Here is another thought exercise. Why did a Middle Eastern religion about a Sun-god turned into a jewish man-god only find traction in Europe? All the \"witnesses\" were in the Middle East, and christianity never found a foothold in the Middle East, despite the Crusades and multiple other brain-washing efforts. This was the area that Ioesus was supposedly followed by thousands, yet nobody in the Middle East wrote down a single word, did a simple drawing sketch, sculpted a sculpture, nothing. Not a single shred of evidence of any Ioesus archetype. The Romans have no accounts of a jewish superman rebel, despite numerous accounts of the jewish rebellion in general. Almost like there never was an Ioesus, except in the fervent imagination of Saul/Paul.  \n  \nThere have been many more archaeology findings since 2008 and they all tend to disprove the 'bible' rather than confirm it. These are important facts and findings for True Atheism to understand.",
