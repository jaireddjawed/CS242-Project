Now granted, I don't mind this when the intentions are good. Like, they already paid the base amount for the order only have a 20 left and want to tip me 3, so I give them smaller bills to do so. But its so irritating because it gets your hopes up, and in my opinion I think its kind of disrespectful.\n\nFor example, *customer gives me enough money for the order*\n\nC: \"Hey do you have change for a 20?\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, hang on.\" *thinking I'm gonna get a tip*\n\nC: *takes the money and hands me a 20 and pockets all the money I gave him* \"Thanks.\" *walks inside*.\n\nOh man that shit is annoying. You guys should be careful because I had a guy do this and the transaction became so confusing with all the money going back and forth that I realized he was ripping me off, so I took the money back.

I didn't get my birthday off.\n\nInstead, I got stiffed by a family who doesn't understand the concept of penning up an aggressive dog, stiffed by a family who ordered almost $70 worth of food, and by the way, did I mention I'm still stuck in a car that I saved nine months' worth of tips to get out of?\n\nI don't understand this. Why can't people pen up their aggressive dogs? Why is that so hard? If you're amazingly lazy, a good leash costs less than $10. Can you at least hold him back a bit? That dog was anxious enough to bark at me that he bowled over a kid to get to the door. You apologized for him and said he “just talks, he doesn't bite.” But I don't know that! I don't know you!\n\nAnd why do people struggle so hard with this? $2 on over $90 of food is not an appropriate tip (especially not on Super Sunday). $0.00 on nearly $70 worth of food is definitely not an appropriate tip. We can read the totals, you know. We're not stupid.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love where I work. The management is great, my coworkers are great, the tips are pretty damn good. But that just magnifies all the shitty parts even more.",

        "text": "After reading and being a fan of this subreddit for quite some time, I've decided to share one of my favorite retail experiences. This happened some ten years ago, but the situation is still clear as day as it's one of those things that happens where it's just too ridiculous to forget.\n\n***\n\nWhen I was 15/16, I worked at a local pizza shop as a cook. It was a national chain, but privately owned. And since they had so few employees, I was also making less than the minimum wage at the time on about 10 hours a week. Which is even funnier since I still made less than minimum wage after a 50 cent raise, but I digress.\n\nNormal day, normal dinner rush. We were getting a good push of calls and walk-ins to keep us busy. It was one of those days where things actually seemed to be going right.\n\nWe get a call sometime towards the end of the rush from a lady named.. Judith. I call her Judith, since Judith seems like the type person who would be picky about peanut butter tasting too much like peanut butter. The type that just gets underneath your skin, and gives you an irrational hatred for everything while she speaks.\n\nGetting threw the order, I get her address. I find out she's about 5 miles outside our delivery zone. These types of orders need manager clearance, so I ask to put her on hold for a moment while I get approval. Big mistake.\n\n**Judith:** *\"But I order here all the time! You've never turned me down before!\"*\n\n**Me:** *\"I'm sorry, but this will only take a moment.\"*\n\n**Judith:** *\"LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER NOW KID!\" Ha, guess who I was just about to talk to anyways?*\n\nI hand my manager the phone, he gets the instant, \"Shit, one of these people,\" faces. He checks the address himself and ends up telling her he'll make an exception for her, but it will be about 30-40 minutes given the distance and order volume currently being handled. So we make the pizza and send it off with one of the delivery drivers. \n\nThe rest of the dinner push goes just like the beginning of it went, then things start to settle down. I'm just settling down behind the counter having a slice myself when another coworker picks up the phone. What I hear is screaming rage.\n\nMy coworker was newer to the position, and I could tell he could barely keep his composure, much less understand the death of whoever was calling. So I took the phone from him to figure out who murdered this persons family, they couldn't possibly be this upset over pizza. When I finally get the phone next to my head, I realize who it is. It's the peanut butter complainer.\n\n**Me:** *\"Mam, this is Mikey from Pizza Shop, what seems to be the issue?\"*\n\n**Judith:** *\"MY PIZZA IS COLD. IT'S EXACTLY 93.6 DEGREES!\"*\n\n**Me:** *\"Excuse me? It's 90 degrees?\"*\n\n**Judith:** *\"I said it's* ***93.6 DEGREES*** *!\"*\n\n**Me:** *\"Oh..\"*\n\nWell, Reddit, I wish I could say I manned up, got a lawyer, hit the gym, and deleted Facebook, but instead I sat there and listened to her complain further while apologizing profusely.\n\nLet me reiterate that this woman was roughly 15 or so miles away, 5 outside our delivery zone, and had called at a busy time. By the time the order had been delivered, roughly 30 minutes had passed since the pizza had been out of the oven. We ended up making her a second pizza and redelivering it free of charge. So that's the end of it, right?\n\nNope. She calls again. This time my manager was the one who picked up the phone, but I was close enough to hear the entire conversation.\n\n**Judith:** *\"MY PIZZA IS STILL COLD. BUT NOW IT'S 98 DEGREES!\"*\n\n**Manager:** *\"Miss, first of all I can promise that we didn't deliver Nick Lachey and the boy band 98 Degrees. Secondly, you sound like a woman with enough money to own either an oven, or a microwave. If both, I suggest the former.\"*\n\n\\*click*\n\nPeople can be so wonderful.",

        "text": "Hello again, /r/talesfromthepizzaguy. I've posted here previously, back with another story. First, intro. I'm a (seasonal, when I'm not in school) cashier at a fairly busy pizza place. My job is to do anything that needs to be done, except for make line and routing board. I've even been put on cut occasionally. I only work rush nights (for us, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday), usually 10+ hours as the only cashier. I stay very busy, and I've gotten good at my job. There are very few things in the store I can't do. Even the owner has complimented me on my performance. \n\nBecause of how busy our location is, we are sometimes used as a training location for newly promoted managers from other nearby stores owned by the same guy. It's a good way to get them lots of experience in a short amount of time, or so I'm told. The owner seems to like the \"out of the frying pan, into the fire\" method of training.\n\nThe last time I worked, we had two new managers from other locations being trained at our location. They had been there several weeks before I started back up. When the new managers learned that I was \"starting\" (they apparently missed that I had worked there previously), they not-so-quietly voiced their concerns to our GM and store owner about hiring a cashier. They both saw it as a \"useless\" position based on their previous experience. This lead to quite a few of my friends on staff warning me to watch out for the new managers, and that they might try to start something.\n\nMy first night back was a bit of a mess. It was new year's eve, and my first night working in 3 months. That was a bad time to try to de-rust my skills and learn what had changed. I introduced myself to the new managers, and tired to make it clear that I had quite a bit of time at the store already under my belt, but it was so busy that it never really sank in. One new manager (who we'll call \"Bill\") kept re-arranging the front counter and doing things extremely different from how I'd been taught to do them, and didn't bother telling me he thought I was doing things wrong. This lead to a bunch of inconsistencies up front (mostly receipts or stickers for orders getting lost) , which pissed off the other new manager (\"Ted\") who was running cut. They were both visibly irritated by time the dinner rush settled down. I decided to try to get back on their good sides by apologizing for getting in the way, and assuring them that I'd get better as I got used to to the job again. I got half-hearted dismissals, which didn't bode well. Although later that night I did hear Bill ask our GM just how much previous experience I had.\n\nI didn't see Ted again for a while after new year's. Bill on the other hand worked every shift I did for two weeks post new year's. At first, there was more of the same conflict. But eventually he was spending less and less time at the counter, and he stopped shooing me away from the carry-out orders. Coincidentally, the fucked up orders stopped happening. Eventually, on a slow night about a week and a half after new year's, the GM decided to formally introduce Bill and I. Introductions were made, and then the GM gave me something out-of-the-ordinary to do, to make cleaning easier that night. Bill just looked at me and said \"you can do that?\" Before I could respond, my GM came back with \"There's not a whole lot around here Larry can't do. If you need something, ask him. He'll have it done before you think of it again.\" Bill's eyes went wide and he said \"you weren't kidding about your experience. I'd been double-checking the counter for a while now, but all we seemed to do was get in eachother's way. It's good to know you're good for other things too. I'll stay off the counter, seems like you've got a better handle on it than I do. I hate answering phones anyhow and that's usually where I'm stuck if you're not here.\" Manager number 1 eating his words about cashiers.\n\nNow for Ted. Ted and I were never really formally introduced, but we did end up on similar work schedules. After the fuckups at the counter stopped happening, Ted became mostly indifferent to me. I could still tell he didn't really think I needed to be there, but my presence didn't irritate him anymore. Eventually he even had me getting things/running orders for him (part of my job is to make sure that whoever's running cut never needs to leave the cut station. That includes running out carry-out orders and keeping things like dips/peppers/boxes/pasta tins stocked) instead of doing it himself. Ted was also there the night I told the GM when my last day of work was to go back to school. He overheard the GM and I's discussion, looked at me and said \"Really, you're leaving?\" I just kinda nodded. He sighed and said \"damnit. And I was just getting used to having you here too. I'll be honest with you, I don't like cashiers. Most of them are useless. But you're not a cashier.... you're... well you're a Larry. And you're actually useful. If we could get 30 of you who could drive delivery, we wouldn't need most of the rest of the employees (about 90). Sucks to see you go man.\" .... Manager 2 now apologizing for being a dickhole.\n\nIt's not often that people in positions of power apologize for things. I'll take what I can get. Also, job security and references when I finally leave that place for good are both great things to have.",

I took myself off the road to catch up on dishes and stuff so I didn't leave them for the driver that I was leaving to be alone for the late night rush and the phone started ringing. No one picks up after 5 rings so I dry my hands and answer it. It's a customer that ordered online, but wanted to make sure we put LOTS of meat on his pizza. He says \"I'll make sure to give the driver an extra tip if there's a lot on it\" and it slipped out... \"Yeah right.\" \"What?\", he said. I was already in at this point so might as well keep digging. \"I deliver to you all the time. You never tip and always complain, yet you still keep ordering. You should try a different pizza place in town.\" He tried saying the non-tipper wasn't him (yes, it is, I know you well dude, but ok) so I said I'd go personally make the pizza. Obviously I shouldn't have said anything, but damn it felt good. And it's probably sounding ruder than it really was here - it was quite innocent and just slipped out - but hopefully this guy will either stop being an asshole or be too embarrassed to order again. I just wish I had stayed to ask the driver if he got tipped. The surprising part is that this guy works at a competitor in town. He absolutely knows better and is just a douche. ",

My current store has eleven drivers. ELEVEN. And we have three opening drivers, each of the other guys taking two days. I get two night shifts (Friday and Saturday) where I make decent bank because I'm pretty good at making actual deliveries, but it's a long fucking climb to make any sort of cash in the days leading up to that.\n\nNot a lot of driving, a ton of legwork, and I'm still making the same rate hourly as every other driver there.

My longest round trip delivery within my range is about 15 miles. \n\nWhen things are going smoothly, I can generally get all my deliveries out on time. Although, on some nights like Friday night, you really have to hustle, racing from one end of town to the other to keep up. Every minute counts. No time for dicking around.\n\nSo, I had four deliveries. Of course, they were going in all different directions. Two were to good customers who take care of me.  So I take care of them, if you know what I mean? (Priority delivery I call it) I get them taken care of and race to the other end of town to deliver to a new address where I've never delivered before.\n\nI pulled into the long mud driveway to a very large, somewhat ramshackle house.  Lots of junk in the yard. It's been unseasonably warm here in New England, so the dirt driveway was thawed and like quicksand.  There are no outside lights on, and numerous doors.  I make my way up a steep ice, slush, mud covered hill to the front door.  Knock. Wait... Knock. Wait some more. No luck. I'll try the other doors.\n\nSame result. O.k., well maybe they use the back door? So I make the trek back down the hill and around to the back of the house, while carefully trying to avoid tripping over the junk in the dark. \n\nI make my way up the deck to the back door, where I see can see a light in the kitchen. The back door is ajar. This is kind of odd during winter in New England.  I can see into the kitchen and there's like no furniture or anything in the house.  Just boxes and construction debris. I knock. Ring bell. Call out. Nothing. \n\nAt this point I'd been there about ten minutes. I've got one more delivery in the car. I try calling the customer, but It goes to a full voicemail. I send a text saying I've arrived at 31 xx Street, but I can't make contact and I'm taking it back to the store. Please call the store if you receive this message.\n\nWhile I was at the correct address when I texted the customer, I accidentally hit a wrong digit and incorrectly told him I was at the wrong house. Even though I was at the right house!\n\nOn the way back to the car, I notice there are large CO2 tanks out back. Like the big ones they use in labratories.  Not the little ones for soda fountains. They are connected into the basement of the house, the windows are all blacked out and all the entrances to this area of the house were heavily secured. As I came around the corner, the scent hit me.  It was unmistakable.  The smell of freshly growing Marijuana!  \n\nAs I walked around a corner, I noticed ventilation systems venting out of the basement area of the house. As I got close the them, the odor was so strong, it was almost overpowering. It was glorious! Almost like the smell of a freshly killed skunk on the road. I've delivered to places where people grow before, but never smelled it this strong! \n\nAs I raced off to the last delivery, what do you know, I get 1/2 mile down the road, when the customer starts calling me!  As always, I ignore the call. (I get great pleasure out of doing this in these situations where a customer has wasted my time) You know the customer's starving and knows they messed up. They're desperate for you to come back! You were just there. You must just be right down the road? But it's too late! No food for you!\n\nIgnoring his calls, the customer finally tries replying to my text as I'm getting back to the store.  \"NO, I'm at 31 xxx St., not 21!(Keep in mind I really had gone to 31)  Finally, I reply that I'm sorry, but this is my personal phone number and the delivery has gone back to the store to be redispatched, . \n,\nWhen I got back to the store, the guy has called like three times, telling them I had gone to the wrong house! His order is now 95 minutes old. They're remaking it and sending me back.  However, before wasting my time, this time I'm calling this guy from the store before I leave. \n\nI called from the store phone. At first he doesn't know it's the same driver who came out. \n\nMe: Hello, this is Jason, the xxxxx delivery driver. How are you tonight?\n\nCustomer: \"grumbles something\"\n\nMe: I'm sorry. We seemed to have not made contact with you tonight. We're going to be coming back out after we remake your order, but I just wanted to confirm the house.\n\nCustomer: It's 31. The third house on the right! YOU WENT TO THE WRONG HOUSE!  Wait, the food's not even out of the store yet? Great! Just great! It's the third damn house on the right! *loudly sighs   I can hear him grumble to somebody else that the food isn't even out of the store yet.  \n\nMe: Yes sir, I'm sorry, but that's where I went.  We had your food there at 40 minutes after you placed your order. It was the big yellow house, kind of set back, right? \n\nCustomer: Yeaahhhhh......\n\nMe: Yes, the big yellow house! I walked all around it and tried four doors. There were some big CO2 tanks out back, right?\n\nCustomer: Umm, what? yeahhhh...\n\nMe: Yes, that's the one! I walked all around it and tried the back porch door leading to the kitchen. It was ajar, so I called in and then tried calling you, but the voicemail was full. I looked in the windows when I was walking around the house and it looked vacant, so  I thought I was at the wrong place! I'm really sorry, but I'll get that right back out to you! \n\n*His demeanor changed at this point. \n\nCustomer: *quietly mutters \"Well, go to the front door.\" \n\nMe. Actually, I tried that one and almost slipped on the ice on the hill. Could I call you when I arrive to come out?\n\nCustomer: Sure. Fine!\n\nSo, I take my time getting his food back to him. Things had slowed down, so no rush.\n\nWhen I got there, he was out the door to meet me before I could get out of the car! Big smile on my face, I give my usual \"Hi, how you doing tonight?\" As I do every delivery. You can tell he's not pleased, but he begrudgingly digs some bills out of his pocket. But he was short cash, so he had to run back in the house.  \n\nWhile I'm waiting, I happen to be standing next to one of the ventilation ducts coming out of the house.  The marijuana odor was dank and overpowering. I can see buckets of chemicals, potting soil, and fertilizers in the room behind the door.\n\nThe guy finally comes out and pays. Gave me a $5 tip.  I ask, gardener, huh? And kind of nodded toward the tanks. He just kind of looked at me like dear in headlights. Didn't really answer. \n\nMy coworker told me that when he first placed the order, he seemed kind of odd on the phone and exclaimed  \"Dude, you guys deliver? Wow, this is going to change my whole world!\"\n\nWell, sure enough, he ordered again last night. Some bizarre combination sandwich with tuna, cheddar cheese, jalapeños, pickles, mayo, etc. and mozzarella sticks. This time I got it out in record speed. Went to front door this time. When he answered, I said \"hey, how's it going? Another delivery, huh? Seems like I was just here. Yeah, I DEFINITELY remember this house!\"   Standing there at the front door, I could see most of the house was empty. The aroma that billowed out the door was so strong, surely the guy must have known his cover was blown?  He only gave me $1.75 tip the second time!\n\nI do live in a state with legally registered caretakers/growers of Medical Marijuana. Perhaps this guy was legal, but it's more fun to think I discovered an illegal grow house? I had to laugh because you can basically see the police station from his house. Perhaps you should be a bit more careful having deliveries to your grow house? It would really suck to get busted or robbed because you were careless and made it known to strangers (especially delivery drivers) that you grow large amounts of presumably high quality weed at your house! Especially when you stiff the driver with a cheap tip.  \n\nWe'll see if he continues to order and stiff? It could be a good situation for tip extortion? ",

        "text": "Just wanted to share a little story to some of yall out there. \n\nI worked at an Italian Restauraunt delivering for about a year, it was right next to a military base, and therefore I had a pass to get on the base, and was often delivering to families in there, people working there during the day, and to the temporary housing units. I really liked the job, it was a family owned place, almost all Hispanic, but cool people and it was tons of fun. I was making decent money, but never was able to churn out that many deliveries because we always had multiple drivers, and from the entrance of the base to the back where the single family homes are is a 15 minute drive. I was making $5 an hour, and the tips were OK.\n\nA month ago I moved into a new place with my girlfriend, in a more suburban, and wealthy area. Again, I'm working for a family owned place, but this time I'm making $8.38 an hour. \n\nI've only worked 2 nights so far, and its incredible. My first night, I worked from 5-10 and walked out with $85 in tips...+$40 in hourly pay. That's $125 in 5 hours. Awesome. Last night I worked from 5-8 and walked out with $55 + $24 in hourly pay. That's $80 in 3 hours..... This place is just so damn busy, and the farthest I'm driving is 5-8 minutes. So far I was invited into a really nice house into this massive kitchen with granite countertops and an island. Got 2 $20 bills for a $24 meal. A couple $10 tips, a few around $7-8 and everything else has been $5. Besides on 2 occasions a kid (&lt;12) answered the door and I got no tip.\n\nI really like my coworkers, and I believe they feel the same about me. I have a 9 hour shift in 7 hours so I think it's time to go to sleep. I'll update after the long day. ",

Although my Spanish has improved to where I can take most orders, I'm far from fluent. \n\nOne night, a couple of men who only spoke Spanish called our store to order a ham and pineapple (Hawaiian) pizza. The trouble came when I was confirming the order. \n\nMe: Algo más? (Anything else?)\n\nMan: No, gracias. (No thanks).\n\nMe: Y es una pizza grande con jamón y pinga--\n\nI froze. For those of you who don't speak Spanish, \"Pinga\" is slang for dick. It isn't a pizza topping, and it certainly isn't a word you want to say to a customer. I began to panic.\n\nMe: I mean-- Pinga. Pina. Jamón y PIÑA!\n\nMan: Correcto. (That's correct)\n\nNot knowing whether I had offended him, I awkwardly took his credit card information and told him it would be there in about 40 minutes. \n\nI'm not totally sure what he said next, but he made a joke about the pinga comment and both men started laughing. Relieved that I wasn't in trouble, I laughed along (even though I didn't understand), told them to have a good night, and ended the call.\n\nAnd one from today: I gave a carryout customer his pizza. He opened the the box, gave it a snoof and said, \"It looks excellent!\" Without thinking, I responded with \"Thanks, you too\".",

Do you know how dangerous that is?\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, I tried knocking two other times and calling once but there was no sort of response.\n\nC: That doesn't fucking matter. Knocking like a fucking cop can scare people and possibly cause grave results\n\n*RED FLAG*\n\nMe: Again, I'm sorry sir.

When I asked him why he did so he said that he 'had to.' Inexcusable and rude.\"\n\nAny sort of feedback of two stars or less, you're supposed to call the customer back and try to fix the issue. Normally because of the hour, the call would be returned in the morning, but because the feedback was left that late, my manager decided to call him back. I explained the entire situation to my manager beforehand. We went into the office and he put the call on speaker so I could be involved ( C = Customer, Mgt = Manager)\n\nC: Hello?\n\nMgt: Hi sir, this is MGT over here at X, I just wanted to call and follow up with you on the feedback that you left for our driver. Was there a problem?\n\nC: Yeah, you driver knocks like a fucking cop. Do you know how fucking rude that is? Why do you hire assholes like that?\n\nMgt:Sir, please calm down, please don't swear at me. I'm just trying to help.\n\nC: EXCUSE ME? HOW DARE YOU TELL ME HOW TO SPEAK. WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, MY PARENTS? DON'T TELL ME NOT TO SWEAR AT YOU. FUCK YOU. THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING ME FROM GETTING INTO MY CAR, DRIVING DOWN TO YOUR STORE, AND SHOOTING BOTH YOU AND YOUR DRIVER ***click***\n\nMy manager then decides to call the authorities because he doesn't feel safe in any way at all. \n\nA few minutes later, the phone at the store rings and I answer:\n\nMe: Thanks for calling X how can I help you?\n\nC: ....Are you that fucking driver?\n\nMe: Yes sir, how can I help you?\n\nC: Give me the number to corporate. I want to make sure both you and your manager are fucking fired.\n\nMe: One second sir, let me put you on hold while I grab my manager.\n\nBefore he can even reply I have him on hold and tell my manager he's called back.\n\nMGT: Sir here's the number.\n\nC: Fuck you both ***click***\n\nThe next day, I get asked to come in about 30 minutes early so I can meet with my GM and my shift manager so we can explain what had happened. It was ruled that the customer was extremely intoxicated. His order was voided to not cause any trouble and he was banned from ordering.",

The door opens and I see this chihuahua running around the ankles of the customer. I hand them the receipt and ask them to please sign and fill it out. I was given $2 on $75. I say thank you and force a smile, hand them their food and drinks. They ask me to wait a minute just to make sure the dog doesn't get out. Well they take a few steps into the apartment, the dog is still running circles around the person, they trip and I just see boxes go flying and land with a crash. I then hear excited barks from the dog as it goes running towards the nearest pizza. I ask if the customer is okay and they give me a very sad \"yes.\" I told them have a good day and left.\n\nTL;DR Decent order to an apartment, got a shitty tip, they tripped over their dog and dropped all the food",

        "text": "So about a week ago I started delivering pizza because I needed a good side job. I really love it so far. My coworkers are awesome, I get to listen to all of the audiobooks I want while I'm on the road, and I make pretty good tips because tourist economy. So this leads me to my last order of the night tonight. It is about 12:15 AM and I have to take about $100 worth of pizza and drinks to a remote cabin at the top of the mountains. I just need to deliver these and I can go home.\n I should have known something was up when the instructions were \"address is cabin nearby, call when near\" but what the hell, I want to go home. I call when I am near the listed address. The customer on the other end would not tell me the name of the cabin, or the number. She gave me the directions and stated that she was able to see me and would meet me at my car. I was told to not go to the door under any circumstances.\n While I'm waiting at my car, hoping they hurry up and will tip me more than the 3 dollars and some change that would make it an even hundred, a guy walked up to my car and told me that I must have the wrong address and I needed to leave. I told him that he was mistaken and that the customer told me they were coming right out. He then explained that \"this is a religious retreat\" and that \"none of his kids would break the rules and order pizza\". He is now trying to get ahold of the camp counselor that is supposed to be supervising the kids to no avail. All the while, a group of teenagers keeps looking in the window at my car, looking at youth pastor, then running away from the door. Finally, after pointing out to him that it's now past midnight and I want to go home he goes inside and informs the group of pizza deprived teens that they need to pay me. After having a fit about the sheer amount of pizza they ordered, he collects the money. With a glint in his eye, he tells them \"You've just donated $100 in pizza to this driver. You know pizza is not kosher and you can't have it here.\" He hands me the cash, telling me to take the pizza and leave. Manager marks down the price of the pizzas when I get back so I get a nice tip, and the police dispatch really appreciated the metric fuckton of free pizza I brought them before heading home. ",

I immediately ask my coworkers what they've been telling customers delivery times. They say 45 minutes to an hour (pretty standard when it's slow-ish) and immediately I tell them to start calling customers and informing them the real delivery time, while I start getting all the extras for those orders.\n\nI was absolutely stressed out and thought I'd have my head ripped off by every customer. Nope, I walked out of the shop tonight with 120+ dollars in tips, and every customer was so nice, all smiles, and completely understanding of the situation. Best night I've had in a while, both tips-wise and overall kindness of customers. I felt I had to say thanks to anybody else who understands what we drivers deal with, and not ripping off your delivery man/woman's head at the door.",

Usually if it's a credit card order, I asked them if a parent or card holder is home to sign for it. My old store had a child sign and leaving a tip when the parent didn't want that and we ended up having to give them free food and void th charge. But from what I noticed that when it's a cash order and there is clearly money left for a tip, the child seems to always pocket the change and stiff you with a big fat zero or just the coins.

I had exactly one coworker; let's call him Joe Larson. I worked with this guy every night for two years and so we got to know each other pretty well.\n\nAfter I quit that job I did some temp work for about a year and then became a pizza guy. It turns out Joe's wife, we'll call her Tammy Larson, was one of my regular customers. I'd deliver lunch to her about once or twice a week. I knew who she was because I recognized her name on the orders and because I recognized Joe's car parked outside but she didn't know me as anything but the pizza guy. Since JOe worked nights I assumed Joe was sleeping and never mentioned that I knew her husband.\n\nTammy ordered food today but I didn't realize it was her until my GPS took me to her address. Now I may space out at work sometimes but I thought it was odd that I didn't recognize I was delivering to such a regular customer. I double checked the order and realized something was different. Her name was no longer Tammy Larson; it was Tammy Springfield. Joe's car wasn't parked outside.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day!",

I have a lot of stories from my four years and counting as a driver anyway here we go:\n\nSo today we got an order placed online that had a total of $36.84 with the special instructions “BRING CHANGE FOR A $100 DOLLAR BILL”. All over our website it explicitly says “Drivers do not carry more than $17 in change.” In times like this, we have to call the customer and tell them that we cannot bring that much change with us and that they need to give us a different form of payment, find change, or cancel their order. Unfortunately, this guy had a disconnected number and when I tried to call the hotel he had his room set at no calls, so I had no choice but to go and take it anyway.So I go to take this delivery, pleasantly knock on the door and this is how the at the door interaction goes (M = Me, C = Customer)\n\nM: Hi sir! How are you today?\n\nC: *hands me a $100 dollar bill* I want all the change back.\n\nM: I’m sorry sir,  I cannot carry more than $17 at a time.\n\nC: Even though I explicitly said online to bring change for $100? Are you kidding me?\n\nM: I’m sorry sir, it’s corporate policy. Nothing I can do. We tried to call you from the store, but your number came up as disconnected. So at this point you have three options. 1) You use a different form of payment. 2) You can ask up front if they can break the $100 dollar bill. 3) Sadly, we cancel the order.\n\nC: Let’s go up front. This is un-fucking-believeable, I can’t believe you cant follow simple directions…\n\nSo we go up front to see if the front desk has any change to which they don’t.\n\nC: Cancel the order. I guess I won’t eat cause you can’t follow directions and bring change for $100. Go fuck yourself.\n\nM: I do every night before I go to bed. Have a nice day! :)",

I asked him what his run was. He replied he had a quadruple run and that the other closer had a triple run. I responded something along the lines of, what the fuck?? You two are delivering 7 orders and leaving me none? \n\nThis closer told me all the runs were close together, and that he had made shitty tips all night. He also told me he thought I was off the road because I was the next guy out, despite the fact I was on my way back from a delivery. I was furious. Something else that made me angry was knowing that this driver waited for the additional pizzas to come out of the oven. Company policy is not to wait for additional orders without manager approval. This isn't really enforced, but we usually have an understanding that you don't even take doubles if you have an other driver available.\n\nI asked him if they left me anything, and he replied, yeah, the dishes.\n\nSome context that might play a part. I am the newest driver and have been here for two months. I'm still learning, but I'm learning fast.\n\nSo anyway, has anyone else had similar experiences with other drivers hogging orders?\n\nEDIT: I mentioned what happened to the assistant manager tonight. She's real tight with the GM. I didn't mention any names, but she immediately knew who it was. I told her I had already stood up for myself and told him I was disappointed and angry about how it happened.

        "text": "I got a speeding ticket yesterday. Probably doesn't seem like much to most people: 34 in a 25, $78 fine. But it's the straw that breaks the camel's back for me. I've been struggling financially as well as dealing with the usual challenges of the job, and adding extra fear of getting pulled over is too much. \n\nThis is the first time I've been pulled over since I got stopped in Nevada going home from California to Minnesota to visit my grandmother in the hospital (since recovered) around October of 2014. I'd been stupid and hadn't gotten rid of my cannabis before leaving California and ended up ultimately spending 10 days in a free resort as a result. I'd thought I'd gotten over it, since jail wasn't really a bad experience for me (it's disturbing to me when I note sometimes aspects of life which were better Inside), and I'd served cops and delivered to cops since. \n\nBut it's the process of getting pulled over itself which I have apparently become allergic to. There's something about facing that again which scares me far more than a month locked up would. And obviously, in this line of work, it's not exactly unexpected. So I'm going to be quitting. This will be the first time I haven't given two weeks notice at a job, but it's also the first time where I was afraid to continue performing a job. I think completing the two shifts I'm scheduled for today and tomorrow is reasonable.\n\nBest of luck to all of you out there and stay safe. We do a hell of a lot of driving, and it only takes a moment's lack of concentration to destroy everything we work for. I got off relatively lucky here; it was more a wake-up call than a catastrophe in and of itself. It's damn hard to drive perfectly at every moment for months on end and I'm not up to the challenge. My utmost respect and best wishes to all of you who continue to do it day in and day out.\n\nBuckle up; drive safe.",

        "text": "Link to previous story: https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/43g7w9/story_2_part_1_were_not_doing_that_anymore/\n\nSo we waited. On March 4th, 2015 I finally received an email from the Operating Partner that I had handed all the documents too, the first email I received: (all employer email test is in **bold**, my email text is in *italics*)\n\n&gt; **Thank you for bringing to our attention, the issues of other Team Members at our &gt;redacted&lt; location.** \n\n&gt; **We will be contacting the Team Members directly, to resolve the issues, by end of day Thursday.** \n\n&gt; **Please reply that you have received this email.** \n\n\nI was happy that I received a response this time, and  within the 14 day period we gave them, but I was disappointed with their unwillingness to engage me, [their employee's chosen representative](https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act). So I shot back my own email, also on March 4th:\n\n&gt; *I respectfully ask that you do not contact any of the three employees that have already made complaints, other than to ask if they have authorized me to act on their behalf. I have been authorized by the employees, whose complaints I gave to you, to act on their behalf to resolve this issue. This issue, that was brought to the attention of our company more than 4 months ago, effects all employees that are paid at, or near, minimum wage that are required to provide their MVRs to our employer with no reimbursement. Let me be clear here... this issue effects all delivery drivers currently, and formerly, employed by &gt;Business Owner&lt;.*\n\n&gt; *We would like to resolve this issue as quickly and as painlessly as possible. You can contact me directly via the contact information below to schedule a meeting.*\n\n&gt; *Please reply that you have received this email.* \n\nThen I received the following email from the Operating Partner on March 5th:\n\n&gt; **Thank you for responding.** \n\n&gt; **We will be settling the issue, with the employees directly.  We wish to resolve this issue amicably and move forward in a  positive manner.** \n\n&gt; **We never received a former complaint. ( Myself or &gt;Business Owner&lt;)**\n\n&gt; **Many of our Delivery Drivers, obtain their MVR reports from their own private insurance companies, at no cost.  However I do not know if all insurance companies provide this service.**\n\n&gt; **Moving forward, we actually have negotiated/partnered with our insurance company, to run MVR's on our current drivers, twice yearly, at no cost to the employees.** \n\n&gt; **My door is open to any employees who wish to meet and voice their concerns. I am usually in my &gt;Northern&lt; office.  I am in &gt;Southern&lt; office on Tuesday's or Wednesdays. Need to make an appointment to ensure I am in and available.  However I will not discuss other employee's issues/concerns/complaints, regardless of a \"release\" or authority to do so.** \n \n&gt; **Thank you.**\n\nWhen I read this email I was a bit miffed and realized that I might have to involve the NLRB. I replied to this latest email on March 5th: (damn the formatting on this is going to be a biotch) (**bold is my employer**) (*italics are my response*) I have edited personally identifiable names and locations.\n\n&gt;*Please seem my comments below.*\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; **We will be settling the issue, with the employees directly.**\n\n&gt; *I have informed you, twice, that I am authorized, by these three employees, to resolve this issue. Is there a reason why you continue to ignore this statement? These employees will direct you to speak to me. I encourage you to speak to me so we can resolve this issue.*\n\n&gt;&gt; **We wish to resolve this issue amicably and move forward in a  positive manner.**\n\n&gt; *So do we. We, the employees, will be addressing this issue, at least initially, with me as their spokesperson. We may choose to seek legal representation if you continue to ignore our concerted activity. We may also decide to address your denial of our concerted activity with appropriate governmental agencies. We may also decide to seek the assis*\n\n&gt;&gt; **We never received a former complaint. ( Myself or &gt;Business Owner&lt;)**\n\n&gt; *Whether you, or &gt;Business Owner&lt;, received the complaint is immaterial, the complaint was made and received by your representatives. That you never saw the complaint is an internal issue you need to address.*\n \n&gt;&gt; **Many of our Delivery Drivers, obtain their MVR reports from their own private insurance companies, at no cost.  However I do not know if all insurance companies provide this service.**\n\n&gt; *I think you are mistaken in how an MVR is obtained. I am wondering, at this time, if you are just attempting to confuse the issue. I'll assume though, at this time, that you just do not understand how MVRs are obtained by your employees.*\n\n&gt; *A Motor Vehicle Record is obtained from the Washington State Department of Licensing, not through an employee's insurance company. Now it is possible that some insurance companies offer MVRs free to their clients, mine does not and I do not know of any that do. Regardless, the three employees, and I believe all of the delivery drivers employed by &gt;redacted LLC name&lt; and &gt;redacted LLC name&lt;, all obtain their MVRs from the Washington State Department of Licensing.*\n \n&gt;&gt; **Moving forward, we actually have negotiated/partnered with our insurance company, to run MVR's on our current drivers, twice yearly, at no cost to the employees.** \n\n&gt; *Whether or not this is in fact true does not change complaints already made, or possible additional complaints, that &gt;redacted LLC name&lt; and &gt;redacted LLC name&lt; violated State law. Not just for these three employees, but for most, if not all delivery drivers employed by &gt;redacted LLC name&lt; and &gt;redacted LLC name&lt;.*\n\n&gt; *If in fact you are changing the company's policy, we would like*\n \n&gt;&gt; **My door is open to any employees who wish to meet and voice their concerns. I am usually in my &gt;Northern&lt; office.  I am in &gt;Southern&lt; office on Tuesday's or Wednesdays. Need to make an appointment to ensure I am in and available.  However I will not discuss other employee's issues/concerns/complaints, regardless of a \"release\" or authority to do so.**\n\n&gt; *The above statement leads me to believe that you have decided to deny your employees their right to act in protected concerted activity. Please correct me if I misconstrued your above statement.*\n\n&gt; *I hope we can keep this intercourse civil and save the company from needing to defend itself before numerous governmental agencies or possibly in court. I look forward to hearing from you.*\n\nIf you read all that, you probably noticed I did not complete a few of my thoughts. I did not realize this until much later when. Oh well.\n\nThe next email I received was 5 days later, on March 10th. I can only assume that someone needed to speak to an attorney to write the following (I've only edited personally identifiable information such as locations and names)\n\n&gt; **Thank you for your recent communications. &gt;redacted&lt; Papa John’s (“Papa John’s”) affirms that it respects the rights of its non-supervisory employees to engage in concerted activities protected by the National Labor Relations Act. This includes respecting the rights of Papa John’s employees to act together for their mutual aid and protection. Papa John’s gives its assurance that there will be no retaliation, reprisal or discrimination against any employee who engages in activities protected by law.**\n \n&gt; **You have asked Papa John's to recognize you as the legal representative on behalf of Papa Johns’ employees at &gt;redacted&lt;, specifically &gt;Employee #1&lt;, &gt;Employee #3&lt; and &gt;Employee #2&lt;,, and possibly  others.  We decline your request that we recognize you as their representative.  Among other things, we have a good faith doubt that you represent a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit.** \n\nI then sent my last email on March 10th: (what might interest some of you is that I did, in fact, have the majority of employee's permission to represent them on this issue, 7 out of 10, in writing. But that's for another story.)\n\n&gt; *Thank you for your reply. I will take your words under advisement.*\n\n&gt; *Have a good day.* \n\nAnd I left it there. Things were not finished though. I started work on addressing the issue via other means.\n\nNow to the good part.\n___\n\nOn March 4th **the company issued a check to Employee #1 in the amount of $104**, the exact amount sought. On March 4th **Employee #2 was issued a check in the amount of $26**, the exact amount sought. **Employee #3 informed me that he received a check, for an undisclosed amount**. Employee #1 and #2 also received the following letter:\n\n&gt; We are in receipt of your letter dated February 16m 2015, alleging a violation of Washington's wage and hour laws with respect to requests for copies of your Motor Vehicle Records (MVRs). Please understand that continued proof of your good driving record is a necessary job qualification for your position. Further, we are not aware of any requirement that an employer reimburse an employee for the cost of providing proof of the employee's continued qualifications for his/her job. Although we strongly deny any liability or wrongdoing, we want to resolve this matter amicably and move forward in a positive manner. Accordingly, please find enclosed a check payable to you in the amount of &gt;XXX&lt;, as reimbursement for your alleged costs. This payment is not and should not be construed as an admission of any wrong doing or any violation of Washington's wage and hour laws.\n\nWhen I read that letter I laughed a bit. We'd accomplished the smaller part of what we wanted to accomplish. We'd shown, that through working together, that we could recover lost wages; at least for these three employee. This was only the first step.\n\nTowards the end of this story I started work on addressing associated issues that had become apparent to me. Issues that needed to be addressed through the proper channels. I'll be telling those stories in the near future.\n\nBTW... **Our employer no longer requires us to provide the MVRs at our cost.** Our employer now purchases their employee's MVRs through the employer's insurance company, at the employer's cost. **That itself is a win in my book.**\n\n\nFinal BTW... Employee #1, #2, and #3: Thank you for allowing me to assist you in recovering your lost wages. Thank you for working with me and for trusting me. And for all you other employees of my franchise that are reading this, WE ARE NOT DONE, stayed tuned to your emails, your texts messages, and here. There's more happening that you may not be aware of. If you work for any of the following Papa Johns locations in Western Washington and you would like to become involved, send me or /u/redditcoruum2 a private message and we'll reply with our contact information.

After giving him his pizza, I backed away, down the driveway that was about a quarter mile long, because I couldn't turn around on his property, he really had an awkward narrow driveway. \n\nAnd I can't see shit behind me, my reverse lights really aren't helping I'm just kind of using my headlights as a guide so I know I'm still on the driveway. I feel a bump, and I think, \"Sweet, I'm back on the road.\" and I crank the wheel and back right in to this dude's mailbox. I get out, see the entire corner of my bumper is caved in, the taillight is cracked and I'm absolutely pissed at myself. \n\nThe guy's mailbox was fine, the post was just splintered a bit. So I drive back to his house to inform him of what happened, and we go assess the damage. I offer him everything in my wallet, $80 at the time, and plead with him not to take things further. I had no clue if I'd be in enormous trouble or what, I had just started delivery driving at 18. Knew my parents would be pissed. Figured my boss wouldn't let me back on the road.\n\nHe hesitates for about 30 seconds, kinda thinking like, \"Wellllllllll.....\" then he finally goes \"Yeah that's fine.\"\n\nI basically paid for his pizza that night, and several other nights. But what really bothered me, was I delivered to his house for 2 more years and he never got it fixed. I should've just offered to do it myself, but I panicked and grabbed a wad of cash. I had the pleasure of driving by the splintered post of the mailbox almost every other week and being reminded of it.",

So my Dad was afraid that if he got busy he wouldn't have enough drivers, so he said that I may have to work. I ended up not having to work for the whole night, but I did do like 8 deliveries before I left (which took like an hour or two). Anyways, during my deliveries I noticed a few things about how people tip. I have delivered on Christmas eve, Thanksgiving eve, during the east coast blizzard, New Years Eve, New Years day, and of course the super bowl; Some of the major events that happened in the last few months. So the thing that I noticed about customers is that out of all of those days, people tipped the most during the superbowl. I was astounded by that; people were saying that they felt bad for me because I couldn't watch the game and multiple people even offered me beer. I didn't take it because I was delivering pizza, and well I'm only 19. I wanted to know if you guys had similar experiences when it came to working on some of these major holidays/events. \n\n\nBTW ironically I clicked on random sub for the first time and it took me to this page which I thought was weird because I have been around the pizza business my entire life. \n",

Didnt get home until an hour after close on each night. \n\nOur new rota was put up sunday confirming my suspicions, only drivers now work till close, and always one by themselves. Pretty pissed about this as I took the job to be a driver, which I love doing, not be a late night dishwasher. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else has similar experiences, also any help with how to take this up with the manager  rather than just quiting would be great.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I dont mind cleaning helping out in the store, its just that one driver (and always a driver) has to do it on their own is the part which annoys me.\n\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the great replies, I think i was just a little tired and exhausted from doing three closings back to back.

Basically the demand for pizza is going to be greater than the combined output of all pizza restaurants in the nation can supply for a couple of hours.   You may try tricks to get ahead of line like placing a timed order, or coming to pick up your pizza instead of having it delivered.  They generally don't work.  The problem is we don't have enough room in the oven.  We can only cook pizzas so fast.  Whenever you place your order, it goes into the line of pizzas.  We will make them and take them in order.  So, please be understanding.  We will get it there as soon as we can.  If you really want to have pizza there at kickoff, I suggest you order earlier than you might think necessary, and accept that at kickoff your pizza might not be steaming hot.",

Didn't want him waiting under that for even a second cause I've had that happened to me 3 times on Wednesday. So I go ahead and place the order.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, get a phone call and answer it. Phone isn't working right but I know the Domino's guy is outside cause I saw the headlights. Open the door and wave him inside. We talk about the phones acting weird whilst exchanging food and money. Wish him a good night and a be careful out there, then plop down with my pizza and cheese bread. \n\nGet back to the tracker and 5 star everything and in the comment section I wrote \"Awww yeah! Food is delicious and you guys rock!\" or something very close to that. Fast forward 2 hours. I get a call from the Domino's number. Slightly confused I answered the phone and it was the manager. He was calling to say thank you for the high ratings and for the comment that I had said. He said he appreciated it and that he was giving me a free 2liter the next time that I ordered. I was thoroughly shocked and appreciative that he would not only take the time to acknowledge my comment but also give me something free as well. I've always order from here because I really like the food and I've never had any problems that weren't quickly resolved. Because of this, they will always be my goto pizza place as long as I live here.",

Today was a delivery day but the manager called me over to listen in on the other phone since he was having trouble understanding the customer (very Asian, happens a lot). \n\nCustomer was a woman ordering pepper steak and requested $2 extra pork with it. He asked her **four** times if she was sure she wanted extra pork with her pepper steak. Affirmative. Okay, weird, whatever. I hang the ticket in the kitchen, go take a delivery. \n\nCome back and there's a middle-aged guy RAGING at my manager at the front desk. People are staring. Now, my manager's a short little Chinese guy. He's adorable. You don't yell at him. The guy's just yelling and yelling about how his wife wanted extra pork in the fried rice, how everyone that works here is retarded, how could we screw up an order like that, etc. Meanwhile, manager J isn't breaking a sweat, just smiling politely and quietly saying \"Okay sir, I'm sorry. We'll remake the order for you.\" Not even defending himself. \n\nI walk over because I'm hormonal this week and absolutely livid but still calmly just ask the guy why he feels the need to talk to people that way. Boom. Bomb explodes. Now I'm the retarded one, butting in, an idiot, probably dumber than everyone here. \n\nWhat the hell do you do in that kind of situation because it's taking everything in me to not spam their number all over craigslist.

Fortunately for me, it went to the pant leg. Years ago, I had a delivery that the customer had two pit bulls running freely in their property, which had a high wooden gate.
