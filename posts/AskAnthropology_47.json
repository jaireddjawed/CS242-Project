I found tonight that he was selling a group of 50-ish coins he claims were found when a man was building a house in Afghanistan. He claims the coins are from the buddhist era. Most of them definitely are in coin shape, but have no discernible features. I took a [picture of what looked liked the best of the bunch](http://imgur.com/q8CIk9z). Please forgive the potato quality, all I had was my phone and it was night time. They certainly look interesting, and the fourth from the left on the top has some writing that even I as someone who studies eastern languages is having trouble identifying (tho it looks Indic). He's offering the bunch for 2500 CNY (about 375 USD).\n\nNow obviously, buying and selling cultural artifacts is not a good thing. My question is, would these be worth purchasing in order to donate to some museum or historical organization, or is there a good chance these are fake? Also, it would be optimal to return these to their home country, but considering the state of Afghanistan, I'm not sure how many such organizations exist to take them.",

How about Scandinavia, central/South Europe, France, Spain, the Balkans, Baltic region, Ukraine, and Western Russia?

        "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that infanticide has been used as a mechanism for population control for most of human history. Also, it was used to deal with infants that could not survive the material realities of the ecology in which they were born (be that pastoral-nomadism, hunting/gathering, horticulturalism, or agriculturalism). \n\nWhich society committed infanticide of their handicapped babies by \"returning the baby hippos to the river\"?\n\nWe have better mechanisms of and education surrounding effective contraception than probably 99% of the human existence. It is more accessible too. Not that notions of birth control would have ever developed during the first 99% of the human existence partially given that for hunter-gatherers, ovulation was less frequent than sedentary populations and breastfeeding also tended to reduce ovulation. In more recent centuries of sedentism, a high number of offspring with a low level of investment was a suitable reproductive strategy given high rates of child mortality. \n\nIn the here and now, child mortality is low, we live in a (post)industrial society where we must subsist via a monetary economy with vast income/wealth inequality. The question of children becomes a deliberate decision of when, how many, and means of subsistence. But causal sex happens and so do accidents despite access to effective contraception. Abortion even if legal is not necessarily accessible to the individual. There are safe haven laws and adoption agencies to protect and re-home unwanted infants. Unfortunately, there are an over-abundance of unwanted infants and children. And for those who are not permanently adopted, was it really benevolent and ethical to have had relegated them to a life of poverty? (I don't mean to suggest callously euthanizing children that aren't adopted but rather that had the parent(s) been presented the decision to humanely euthanize at birth, there would hopefully be *less* children abdicated in the future.) Why is the societal consensus to expend such protective efforts of infants that are not even self-reflexive? We view infants as people when many cultures throughout the world do not express that view until certain ages/developmental achievements.  \n\nI pose the same question regarding significantly mentally or physically handicapped infants. Why subject the infant and parents to a future of suffering if they choose not to? This isn't a mountain to climb, they are the mountain themselves. \nWhy not preempt the suffering of that is what the parents want?\n\nWhy not draw the line when an infant becomes self-reflexive?\n\nOn a tangent, what is the social mechanism behind the vilification of young mothers who commit neonaticide? \n[**Life in prison for neonaticide?**](http://www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/story/news/local/2016/06/27/emile-weaver-sentencing/86429604/) \n\n[Research indicates that these girls/young women deeply deny their situation for months only to disassociate during the trauma of birth thus pushing them to this brink of desperation--what society legally and morally deems murder--in the name of self-preservation against feared social alienation.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/crime/ct-sta-ui-neonaticide-st-0424-20160422-story.html)\n\nFrom the article:\n&gt;But Fleegle said throughout the trial, evidence was heard that before and after she placed the baby in the trash, Weaver was more concerned with herself than her child. She told a detective she was more worried about her own health than that of her newborn.\n\n&gt;\"That does not show or verbalize any type of remorse,\" Fleegle said.\n\nBeing more concerned with ones own health than that of ones newborn after a (psychologically) traumatic birth doesn't necessarily seem like an abnormal response to me. Do you have any cross-cultural information surrounding this notion of obligatory selflessness surrounding parenting and small children?\n\n\nI don't expect much moralistic backlash from this sub, but in case you were curious: \nWhat if I died via infanticide? \n&gt;I wouldn't have cared because I would no longer exist to reflect upon my death let alone my future, in fact I would not have had the capacity to reflect upon anything. I would have felt pain or discomfort, and my hope now would be that the acting individual would have been swift. \n\nAnd before you think I'm a sadist, I probably could never bring myself to have an abortion should I find myself in that situation. \n\nIn conclusion, please offer me some cross-cultural perspectives of both time and space.

The theory that I have come across is that the Phoenicians originated from the city of Tyre, and managed to settle all over the Western Mediterranean without the locals giving them much if any trouble. Herodotus claims they came from East Arabia or Africa, which also seems odd.\n\n I find this sort of hard to reconcile, and always wondered if the people that became the Phoenicians of Tyre were culturally related to the Western Mediterranean (the areas they would come to dominate without much trouble and in a short time). I am wondering if Tyre and Canaan were a sort of an early 'crusader state' that was obtained from the Egyptians by the Sea People (of Western Mediterranean origin) during the LBA collapse. If the early Phoenicians were culturally related to the Nuragic people they would have had connections in every single territory the Phoenicians later came to colonize: Sicily, Sardinia, North Africa, Gibraltar, Southern Spain. I feel like without connections to local hierarchies they would not have been able to settle in coodinated ways in regions that were all culturally allied and connected. They would/could have been pushed out, no?\n\nAlso I find it hard to understand that if the Phoenicians of Tyre were native to the East Mediterranean region, why did they freely pick up cultural traits of both the Hittites and Egyptians (long-time cultural enemies)? It always reminded me of the Ptolemaic Greeks the way the Phoenicians grabbed up cultural material of other groups, showing a sort of a collectors mentality and disregard for longstanding beliefs (sort of like how everyone buys Buddha statues or Hindu stuff today).\n\n**TL:DR**   I always wondered if there had been any genetic studies, metal content testing, or any other in-depth work done into the origins of the Phoenician culture, who to me seem like an odd duck in the Eastern Mediterranean.

This seems to be the kind of age that nature intended for girls to start seeking out and attracting sexual partners. What's interesting is that at 12 most girls aren't yet reliably fertile and it's rare for girls to become pregnant at that age if having unprotected sex.\n\nSo what could be the function of a girl's pre-fertile sex drive?

Now, I have to defend myself against these evaluations before a committee.\n\nAs my research, I did a microethnography of two pubs, observing positions and relations of regulars towards staff and vice versa. Both my supervisor and my opponent criticise I was not active enough in the field, relied more at my own observation rather than talking to guests and staff and generally interacting with my observed surroundings.\n\nI must admit that they've got a point. I did talk to the people there but most of time I acted rather like a bystander. Now however, I have to defend myself against this criticism. A way that was recommended to me was using an example of another ethnographic research where the researcher also prefered observation over participation (within the limits of participant observation).\n\nI understand that participant observation with an active involvement of the researcher in the observed activities is a crucial part of ethnograhpy but I'd like to ask you whether you don't know about a more like above described kind of research.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Here's a specific example from Wikipedia:\n&gt;The origin of humans is not a major feature of Egyptian creation stories. In some texts the first humans spring from tears that Ra-Atum or his feminine aspect, the Eye of Ra, sheds in a moment of weakness and distress, foreshadowing humans' flawed nature and sorrowful lives. Others say humans are molded from clay by the god Khnum. But overall, the focus of the creation myths is the establishment of cosmic order rather than the special place of humans within it.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_mythology\n\nAnd generally, my perception based on popular culture and a very cursory knowledge of Egyptian myth is that it's a lot less rooted in the individual human experience than Greek or Norse or Sumerian or Aztec mythology. I could be totally wrong. But if I'm right, do we have a good guess as to why that is?\n\nIf I had to take a shot in the dark, I'd say it's because Egypt is a geographically isolated society with nowhere to run from the despotism with deserts on both sides, a stable State that lasted for century after century under an autocratic bureaucratic government justified through a rigid, very 'holy' and separated-from-the-common-man type of mythology. Men like Heracles are less celebrated, while the continual victory of Ra over Apep or the divine journey of a Pharaoh is more emphasized. The \"moral ideal\" of the society is a lot more abstract than that of other cultures who are less boxed in and autocratic, because people look up to great monuments and art and men in ceremonial garbs more than strongmen who are successful tribal military commanders in less-stable political situations. (That is a shot in the dark, as I said, but maybe it can get the discussion started.)\n\nI'm not saying there aren't exceptions like Imhotep: just speaking of a general trend that I think may be there, but would be delighted to be corrected on if necessary.",

        "text": "An [article I read](http://quatr.us/westasia/architecture/sumerian.htm) about Sumerian architecture suggested that it was so primitive at first, some Sumerian buildings were filled in like sandcastles because the architects didn't know how to build buildings with hollow interiors yet. Since the Fertile Crescent is often considered the cradle of civilization outside the New World, that led me to think that substantial buildings (i.e., buildings that aren't made of cobbled rocks or huts or what have you, and are made of stone or brick with flat walls and a defined shape) may have begun in Sumeria and spread out to other civilizations such as Egypt, perhaps spreading eventually to India and China.\n\nHow correct is that idea, based on our best model of how the very basics of architecture were developed in the Old World? The vast distances would obviously require second and third and fourth-hand transmission, but I'm talking about a presumed root of these styles in Sumeria.",

        "text": "If I remember correctly, chimpanzees have 13 pairs of ribs (i.e. 26 ribs). Humans have 12 pairs of ribs, or 24 total. However, some humans have 13 pairs of ribs.\n\nWhy would chimpanzees and humans have different numbers of ribs? They diverged five million years ago and have notable morphological differences, but why would rib number be one of them? I can't imagine selective pressures altering DNA to the point that the number of ribs changes in five million years. And why do some people have more ribs? Is it a vestige of our ancestors?",

Some people are doing postmodern interpretive work, others are working in more of an analytical vein in the tradition of Sahlins or Mead (Graeber) and still others are attempting to interface more with the other biological and social sciences than their anthropological compatriots (human behavioral ecology).\n\nDoes it make sense to call all of these veins anthropology? \n\nIf so, why? Because they take culture seriously (though do very different things with the concept?)? Because they make use of ethnography (though conceptualized very differently)? Or because of the breadth of the behavior of their subjects (all these veins of anthro extend into economic, social, political behavior whereas behavioral econ restricts itself, knowingly or not)?",
