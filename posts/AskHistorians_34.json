They felt that my answers to this specific question were unsatisfactory (and they were right!) so I’m turning to you: \n\nWhy would Nazi guards lead prisoners on death marches away from camps? Especially given that 7,000 prisoners were left behind at Auschwitz-Birkenau - what was the point, when they had the tools for mass execution already at the camps?\n\nWhen asked, I told the students it was to give the remaining Nazis and prisoners time to hide the scale of the atrocity from the encroaching Allied troops, but the students were unsatisfied, given the evidence left behind in the camps when the Allies arrived, as documented extensively in photographs taken by Allied forces. If the Nazis weren’t going to destroy the camps, what was the point of leading prisoners away?",

I have been trying to find  some information related to the subject of their day to day life and  religion or cultural practices. But all of my searches online only seem  to pull up sparse info about their mounds or settlements or it is very  sparse. I want to keep somewhat realistic with my description of these  people.\n\nI want to be able to write  a believable first contact with them and describe their daily life with  decent enough detail to really bring you there. I've watched a few  videos ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9liB6PNEW0&amp;t=353s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzaqM42cZe8)) about them on YouTube. I even came across a couple unrelated videos that I thought I could use as well. Such as making [first contact with tribes in South America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYbR6eYrVbQ) and how religion plays a role in [tribal iron smelting in Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6fUHetYxMI&amp;list=PLlGe1Y6mzcuhI4XveY9KoYL7QhSCJZiUH&amp;index=4).  I feel like some of the information from them can be applied with my  story with the Adena, but I would like to have more cultural specific  information about them.\n\n* How religious are they? How much of this religion would be a part of the every day life of the common folk?\n* What types of events would cause the people to make a religious gathering?\n* What would be going on during a religious gathering? Dancing? Bonfires? Sacrifices?\n* What would be the manner of hierarchy?\n* How militant are these people?\n* How  would they react with outside cultures? Especially seeing people of  European or African descent for the first time? Would they be violent,  fearful or in awe?",

Or did other countries follow suit and just ban it to not allow the misinformation to spread? I just find it interesting, countries that would typically have nothing to do with it and are also geographically so far away from where it occurred yet they still decided to instil laws against it makes me think there must’ve been a reason for them to bring the law in.",

        "text": "The ultimate outcome of the US military engagement in Afghanistan is keeps occupying commentators from all sorts of backgrounds, trying to disentangle the multifactorial mess and perhaps learn something about the future. What there is general agreement on, however, is that both in training and materiel, the US military and its allies were superior to the Taliban. Similar patterns are seen in analyses of other insurgencies, e.g. in Iraq, or the ongoing conflict in Palestine: the regular militaries are always superior in training and individual skill. \n\nHas this pattern always held? In analyses of the Vietnam War, the focus is often on the relative ineptitude of American teens picked up at the mowed lawn and the picket fence, and thrown into a meatgrinder against foes who were possibly underequipped and underfed, but hardened warriors with years of jungle warfare experience. Despite the motif in public discourse of the teen entering the military being too stupid for higher education, similar portrayals do not persist about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nInternationally, in analyses of the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist army is usually portrayed as being largely staffed with inept and corrupt officers, and rank and file lacking discipline, while the Communist insurgents are portrayed as disciplined and skilled. \n\nAt what point has this pattern changed, and why? Has the training of regular militaries gone up? For example, how does the training of rag-tag Taliban insurgent stand up next to that of the average WW2 conscript? Are these insurgent fighters simply considered to be low military skill and value because they are competing with modern militaries? Would they have had perfectly adequate military training if thrown into the battles of WW2? Or has the training level of insurgents generally decreased? Why would that be? Could it have something to do with 20th century insurgents being conducted largely by Communist organizations that afforded better funding and organization? What else could be a factor in this picture?",

The vast majority seem almost indifferent about whom they are fighting, and more or less have the attitude of “We’re fighting them because we’re soldiers and that’s what we do. They’re fighting us because they’re soldiers and that’s what they do.” Pejoratives are routinely used about the German army, but it’s rarely with any venom. There’s even a scene where a soldier is reading a newspaper column and, when asked what he’s reading, says that it’s about why they are fighting the Germans. This gets a chuckle from the rest of the men, with the explanation “It seems that we’re fighting the Nazis because the Nazis are bad!” getting a full laugh from the company. However, there is a scene after the discovery of the concentration camps where one soldier who has been to college screams at a column of German POWs about being fascist pigs.\n\nSo, in short, did American troops have any concept of Nazi ideologies and ambitions, or were they completely surprised by the racial superiority and genocide? And would they have even cared, or was that irrelevant to their daily fighting on the front lines?",

This struck me as very strange because I was under the impression that their relationship started good, took a nosedive after Henry Frederick's birth, and was pretty much completely dead by 1607 and rise of Robert Carr. It was odd to me that two separate productions used the same trope.\n\nIs there a historical basis for this story? *Did* James kick out a favorite after the Plot? *Was* there a James-Anne reconciliation, even if brief? Was there even a rumor or bit of gossip that these shows might be leaning on for their depiction? I'm interested in the ups and down of James's relationships and most lay-accessible stuff I've read has understandably focused on more important fallout of the Plot, rather than personal feelings.",

        "text": "Hello r/AskHistorians,\n\nAs a long-time lurker, I am excited to be making my first official post on this subreddit. If I have broken any rules, I apologize profusely and would like everyone to know that such a misstep was not my intention. On to my question:\n\nu/Tatem1961 posted the following question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/113tnkx/comment/j9143h2/?context=3) a few days ago, inquiring about the lived experience of Jewish communities in places like China and India, and if there were any parallels between these Jewish communities lived experiences and the experiences of European Jewish communities, especially when discussing the subject of persecution. u/TheyTukMyJub asked whether the source of any persecution Chinese and Indian Jewish communities faced came from \"native\" religions or from local Christian converts. That last question got the gears in the old noggin churning, and lead to my question, which u/Iphikrates recommended that I make a separate thread for.\n\nIs it accurate to view Christianity itself as the cause of Antisemitism, or did it mix with a preexisting general antipathy toward Jews? I’ve read that there was some friction between the Roman government and certain Jewish groups like the Sicarii, but I’m unsure as to the extent of that general ill will. Expanding on what I've just written, I've read that Jews were not trusted in certain places in the Ancient World-e.g. Alexandria- because their religious practices separated them from the general populace. If such distrust toward ancient Jews existed, did it simply mix with the nascent Christian movement, which served to further \"justify\" anti-Semitism in the popular imagination?",
