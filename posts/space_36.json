        "text": "In fact, you can apply that to every single planet, but for the sake of this post,im only going to say Titan. We just happen to need water that’s made of hydrogen and oxygen to survive, what if there’s another species that appears that actually needs hydrogen and methane to survive, which is what Titans oceans are made off. This makes complete sense, because what kills us humans on earth makes another species survive. For example, swimming, fishes need to swim in water, if they don’t, they die, but if we swim in water too long, we die. One thing that applies for one species can’t apply for every species, we’re not special, we’re literally just random. That’s why it always annoys me when “scientists” always want to find a planet in a “habitable zone” to search for life, but that doesn’t make any sense, because what’s habitable for us might be deadly for another species, and vice versa. Scientists need to think outside the box instead of thinking in a conformed way governed by rules and principles, basically, scientists are searching the wrong places.",

That's insane!\n\nSo I looked up the rate of annual launches and came upon this site: [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space?country=OWID\\_WRL\\~USA\\~RUS\\~CHN\\~GBR\\~JPN\\~FRA\\~IND\\~DEU\\~European+Space+Agency](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space?country=OWID_WRL~USA~RUS~CHN~GBR~JPN~FRA~IND~DEU~European+Space+Agency)\n\nThis shows after decades of stagnation or even decline, there's a spectacular increase of mostly US launches which seems to set in between 2013 and 2018. What exactly happened there? Is it all because of SpaceX and other private companies? And even if so, what enabled them all of a sudden?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "I highly recommend this for anyone who dreamt of being an astronaut as a kid. I was moved to tears many times during the experience. I was in sheer amazement every time I was looking at the ISS from the perspective of being right on it. It also solidified for me the work astronauts put it. It’s not all just playing around in space like I would prefer to fantasize. \n\nI am enthralled with the vastness of our galaxy, and the universe; and to experience it in VR - I felt so grateful, because I won’t be able to actually go (most likely). This was the next best thing. Hopefully it goes to more cities!\n\ntheinfiniteexperience . com\n\nEnjoy!",

        "text": "I love all things space, and one thing that’s come up in my studies of different planetary systems is that our solar system seems abnormally full of stuff. We’ve found systems with several planets, and I can understand that asteroids and comets would be hard to detect in distant systems, but it seems a little odd that we’ve got this many planets, a plentiful asteroid belt, and then the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. And given that the Oort Cloud could extend out to a distance of about a light-year from the Sun, it just seems like such a giant system around a rather average star. Do we have any evidence that suggests all/most such systems have this much stuff in them, and that those objects can be found so far away from the host star?",
