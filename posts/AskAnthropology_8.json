In this context, when states arise, it is generally attributed to \"clans\" of nomadic groups, and is described in terms of a ruling family \"exercising control\" over a given land area.\n\nMy questions are to do with a few broad areas:\n\n- What types of social superstructure do nomadic groups organize in? How does said social structure manifest/reify in daily life? (Interested in both specific examples, as well as generalizable patterns)\n\n- Can a state be administered/controlled by a nomadic group, or are states necessarily sedentary? If they can, what are some examples of states whose ruling group was nomadic, and how did this play out?\n\n- What does it mean to be \"part of\" a state? For individuals living in a place where a given state supposedly holds power, in what ways does this political reality manifest in their lives? Specifically as it is affected by the mobility of the people, and their subsistence method(s). (Interested in both specific examples, as well as generalizable patterns)\n\n- How does the construction/demolition of structures vary, and depend on, the mobility and subsistence method(s) of a people group? (Side note: are there any classificatory systems for types/styles/purposes of human made structures?)\n\nThose aren't all, but some of the main questions I've been thinking about as of late. I realize the scope of the questions, but my main point in all of it is the Variationist angle. Anything that explores and describes the life of people in the above described contexts, and the way they vary/varied across types of cultures and places is what I'm looking for.\n\nThanks.

But thats not it \n\nWhen it comes to lean body mass, the differences are far greater. Ranging from 30 to 42% in samples from industrialized, non-WEIRD, and hunter- gatherer groups. Chimpanzees have an 11-32% difference and they are polygamous and males are violent/competitive. \n\nMales have about 2x the upper body strength of females. \n\nHow are these drastic differences in physical ability not considered dimorphic? Do we only measure it in humans through facial features and height? It would make sense to say we are not dimorphic in that regard because height differences are not that great, and human faces can easily look like another gender with a haircut/makeup. But how do facial features allow males to outcompete other males? \n\nSorry if this comes across as ignorant or crass. Just genuinely curious.",

I haven’t seen much discussion about this on Reddit, however. What are your thoughts, and what implications do you think this carries? Another researcher not involved with the study pointed out that (sic) \"for [me], better cognition is all about connectivity between neurons\". But, to me, it seems like a “chicken and an egg” situation, if that’s the right colloquialism. Connectivity would only matter as far as the amount of neurons present, and I wouldn’t be surprised if modern humans have better connectivity on top of that. Of course, this doesn’t prove in anyway that Homo sapiens have superior intelligence or that neanderthals were less capable of things. But it also seems like people have been heavily romanticizing neanderthals and over exaggerating the conclusiveness of data that would support that they functioned just like us (of which I’m personally of the opinion that there isn’t very much). I’m somewhat curious to know what direction a lot of this neanderthal romanticization will go in if more research comes out concluding that they cognitively distinct from us.",

I’m searching for (preferably article-sized at most) ethnographies/studies that focus on/give examples of the ways in which subjectivity is constructed in relation to culture (in the Geertzian sense of conceptual structures of meaning, such as religion or ideology). I’m interested in the ways in which Geertz’s culture concept might be developed/critiqued in relation to understanding the construction of subjecitivity, agency and power. Please let me know if you have anything in mind :)",

I am not an anthropology student, but I am working on an essay for a different class and am looking for an example of when two (or more) cultures adopted the same new idea but implemented it differently. The topic is about the potential development of a single global culture, and I want to show how cultures adapt to new ideas differently which prevents humanity from forming a single unified culture.\n\nMy initial example was to show how Russia and China both adopted Marx's philosophy but tweaked it in their own way that kept each culture developing along a unique path. However, I feel there may be better examples and that this topic is a bit too complex for the short space I can allot to it.  I considered the Enlightenment but I already used it for a different argument and would hate to repeat myself. I have some more mundane modern examples that I plan to use, but I am hoping someone can remind me of a more impactful historical example that I can include as well (preferably post-1500).\n\nI know countless examples exist, but as it is the end of the semester I feel like my brain is fried and I that I am stuck in one of those crappy thought loops that prevent me from seeing the obvious.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hi everyone! I was wondering if this was the sub to ask this kind of question (and if it isn't I completely understand) but recently I have had an explosive interest in anthropology and was looking for content recommendations. I don't have a lot of people around me who are as interested in anthropology as I am so the people around me don't have many helpful directions to point me in, and I'm looking for a *specific* type of content too so I'm wondering if this type of thing exists already or if this is a new idea that I have.   \n\nI don't really know how to explain it entirely, but in essence I'm looking for something that feels a little like a hypothetical \"Wikipedia: The Show\" if that helps paint a picture. I love learning about human history and society, and one way I have been able to do this is through reading Wikipedia. I like doing this in my spare time because I feel as though that the writing in Wikipedia articles is actually somewhat engaging, straightforward, and unbiased - articles on broad topics/concepts (especially on ones involving society, humanity, and history) are explained with some surprising nuance and detail. For example, I was reading the article about the human mother, and I thought it was so cool how it kind of covers everything about motherhood and how mothers play a key role in our society. It told me everything there is to know (now) about mothers. Reading the article made me feel as though I was an ideological alien that had no concept of motherhood, humanity or human ideas. I think it would be great if there was something out there that is centered around taking a broad concept that involves our real world and history and breaks it down into a wikipedia-esque way. \n\nA real-world example that I can think of that I feel is somewhat close to this concept is the \"Explained\" series on Netflix, which kind of takes this similar concept of explaining a broad concept in a creative way. That said, I'm not really impressed with the show as a whole - I think the show goes out of its way to creative a liberal narrative sometimes (which I don't necessarily mind) but I'm looking for something a little more unbiased in its writing if it's out there. I want to be able to learn about human history without any kind of political rhetoric.\n\nIt is entirely possible that something like this doesn't exist yet (I'm passionate enough to start writing this series myself lol), but I would really appreciate it if anyone knew of any kind of media content that resembles this template. I think this makes a great concept for a show or youtube channel, but I'm all ears. I like reading but I have ADHD which makes it hard to focus sometimes, so having a visual/auditory medium for learning anything helps me out a lot, so I appreciate the advice in advance!",

Playing sports  \nprovided visible evidence of the superiority of the colonizers through their  \nbodily comportment and their “civilized” values and norms of play. The reac-  \ntions by the conquered, colonized, and otherwise “uncivilized” (i.e., non-  \nWestern) peoples were complicated, and sports in colonial contexts ended up  \nsometimes serving to assimilate the natives, sometimes to dominate them  \noutright, and sometimes to offer them a perfectly suited tool to resist and  \ncontest colonial power. Tactics of resistance at least challenged theories put  \nforward by “evolutionarily more advanced” authorities. When colonial  \nempires began to collapse after World War II, sport evolved from a tool of  \nanti-imperialist resistance to nation-building exercises in postcolonial con-  \ntexts in which it served to foster nationalist fervor.\n\nEnglish is not my first language but Im pretty good in it , however I have conflicting interpretations about the \"resistance\" part , does the author mean that , the colonials presented sport to the colonized as a \"soft\" tool for them to use to resist , and subsequently get distracted from doing real resistance , or that those sports where a legitimate way picked up by the colonized that really served as resisting too .  \n\n\nI am gravitating towards the first one as it seems the most logical for me (I am not an expert in the field ), and the author cues when they mentioned the word \"offer\" and when they later talked about how colonization still was present culturally and through the already established hierarchies, but pure linguistic understanding of the passage looks to me like the second interpretation .  \n\n\nso which one is it ? and what is the dominant view of the field about the role sports as resistance tool?",

        "text": "Ancient art (drawings, carvings, sculptures etc) is always interpreted in terms of the culture, but those specific works are created by individual artists whose skills and interpretations may vary.   \n\nAre the works generally consistent enough across artists and locales that it's evident the artists were all working in a particular style common to the culture?   \n\nIs it possible to determine if a work was just some artist that had a peculiar style rather than representative of the larger group? One artist might be particularly fascinated with certain patterns or something.  \n\nAre only the best artists permitted to create religious or culturally meaningful art?\n\nAlso, are there artifacts from \"bad\" artists? or practice pieces by novices?   They must have practiced a lot to make enough that some survived. \n\nAn artist may hold certain beliefs but lack the skills to accurately represent those in his art. \n\nApologies for a lot of questions mashed in here, but I just want to hear more about the subject in general.  I realize there probably aren't answers to most of these. I'd rather meet you all for a beer than to try and type it all out.\n\nThanks",
