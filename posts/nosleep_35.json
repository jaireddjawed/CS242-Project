        "text": "Well I’m here, so I guess that means no sleep tonight. I’ve been scrolling through my Facebook page. I don’t post much on there, but once in a blue moon I take stock of what I’ve posted on my profile. I typically post 2-3 times per year there, mostly to reassure my extended family, high school friends, and others that I’m still alive. \n\n Sometimes I look at the lineage of my profile pictures throughout the years and my statuses. Tonight I did that again. I swiped through my pictures reviewing the likes and comments. It may be vain, but in the sense of the people and relationships I used to have and their strength. I’ve seen my profile pictures multiple times, so that wasn’t the draw. \n\nUntil I saw my profile picture that dated May 5, 2021. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was as if I was looking at a total stranger. \n\nI mean I clearly know it’s me. I haven’t gained or lost a significant amount of weight or have undergone any facial surgeries. Yet, it wasn’t me. Or rather, I’m not who I used to be. I can’t recognize that person. \n\nNow when people say that they usually mean that in a positive way. “Who is she?” is typically the thing to say, but I have to run that back. I’m seeing this picture, saying “who is she?” but it’s in an uncanny valley type of way. \n\nI know it’s me, but I know it isn’t. \n\nThe girl in that picture had friends. The girl in that picture was working at a fulfilling job. That girl had an exciting situationship. That girl was probably the raw and true version of me. \n\nMy mom died in January 2022 and it lead me to the most depraved version of me possible. I found out about her passing in the early afternoon and needed to drive an hour or so north to be with my family. Instead of immediately driving north to be with my family, I drove south to meet up with a coke dealer to begin numbing myself. The spiral would begin from that moment on. \n\nWhen she passed, I inherited a fully paid off home, multiple vehicles and trailers, and her bank account. My mother was no millionaire, but she had inherited her husbands fortune after his death the previous July. I cashed the check and never turned back. I was consulted, counseled and taught what to do with this money and these assets, but I just buried my head in the sand and started digging my own hole at the same time. \n\nIt’s been a year now since her death. While I’ve gone on many trips, own my own home, and still have some money, I blew it. I had a chance to save myself and build something from this tragedy, but I didn’t. It haunts me everyday. I can’t go to sleep at night anymore because I just think of all the responsibilities and tell myself to push them back into my subconscious and pretend they’re not there. \n\nI write this only for myself if I’m being honest, writing helps me process my emotions. By typing this out and making it public, I hope that the support, encouragement and most importantly, scorn will help me overcome all of this and reinvent myself into the person I used to know. Hopefully better than her though. \n\nI envy her. \n\nPlease bring her back. \n\nOne day.",

        "text": "This is Telemachite, the town where I grew up.\n\nPopulation: Zero.\n\nBut once upon a time it was Population: Twenty. It was a thriving, bustling town, named for the mineral underground that was said to be twenty times more powerful than uranium. It was recently discovered and the discovery was a game-changer.\n\nSince then, scientists had been working around the clock to harness this incredible new source of nuclear energy. At least, that was what we had been told. The truth was, none of us really knew. Maybe we were too simple-minded for such confidential information. Everyone was roped in from all over the country to go underground and mine it. Most of us were poor and desperate, willing to do anything for a little bit of cash to stay afloat. \n\nWe were, in the simplest terms, easily expendable. Forgotten. Missed. I know because I looked us up after everything happened in Jenny’s house. No town, no telemachite. Hushed up as always after word on what was going on and what telemachite could do had hit the higher-ups.\n\nLike we had never existed.\n\nMy family was one of them. I was 10 at the time; my brother, Lucky, only 13. I remember days where we had to go to bed hungry. \n\nI remember when my dad got the letter. I remember my father’s eyes lighting up like he just won the lottery. I remember him hollering at us to pack.\n\nWe were there at Telemachite a year later.\n\nAll that seemed to happen so long ago, like a dream, almost. Sitting in the old mines, l looked at once was a thriving town. Typing this down on my phone, I can’t help but feel regretful. I wished we had never moved here. Wished we stayed in our old place, poor but safe.\n\nBut most of all, I wished we had never found Violet.\n\nViolet was our family dog. I still remember the day we found it. We had just gotten off school and finished all our homework on the bus back since our school was far from the town. With nothing else to do, we had gone to a field west of the mines to play. We technically weren't supposed to be there since it was so near the mines and therefore dangerous; but we never listened anyway. It was a beautiful day, and after an hour or so we ran out of games to play, so we laid opposite each other with our heads touching to stare at the clouds swimming lazily by in the azure blue sky.\n\nThen all at once a purple shadow washed over us and I heard my brother giggling, “Gem! Stop it!”\n\nIt wasn’t me. I sat up to look at the culprit and found a mangy dog bending over my brother. But this didn’t look like any of the strays I’d seen. \n\nNo.\n\nIts fur was purple.  Left to right, top to bottom. It stood up straight and stiff, like the bristles on my hairbrush, only this time it was poking out at unnatural angles. It twisted its head to grin at me the way a dog could, and I saw that one eye was silver, the other gold.\n\nThe weird thing was that we had been here for a month or so, and I had never seen any animals or any sign of wildlife. And this thing staring back at me now looked more robot than dog. No way around it.\n\nIt was a beautiful summery day and the sun was out shining, but my heart was as cold as ice and I couldn’t stop shivering.\n\nThe dog was still licking Lucky’s face. He laughed and rolled around the grass.\n\n“Gem, can we keep her?”\n\nI swallowed and looked forlornly at my brother and the dog. They both stared back at me with the same puppy-dog face.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a good idea…” I said slowly.\n\nLucky wasn’t listening. He scooped up the weird purple dog and ran down to our town, shouting about his discovery for all who would listen.\n\n***\nOur parents stared at Lucky’s beaming face and my worried one. Lucky was still holding that dog. It was panting like crazy, and trying not to drool.\n\n“Where did you get the dog again?” my dad asked. He was tired. His face was caked with purple telemachite dust and the stress of the day curled in his brows.\n\n“Near the mines!” Lucky answered.\n\nMy mum smiled wearily at her son’s enthusiasm. Like my dad she spent all day in the telemachite mining business and you could see it in her hollow, haunted eyes.\n\n“You can keep it,” she said softly, and Lucky squealed in victory and dashed up to our room.\n\nI opened my mouth to protest but my mum put a hand on my shoulder. \n\n“Let him. He’s really happy about it.”\n\nThere were tears welling in her eyes.\n\n“Besides,” my mum said softly, and she gave me a broken smile that cracked my heart into pieces as well.\n\n“You kids have been spending too much time in that field. I think a dog might do you good.”\n\nLucky insisted I gave his dog a name. He said he hoped I could get to know it better. He also decreed the dog was female, even though it showed no signs of either gender.\n\nSo I named the dog Violet. And the other weird thing about Violet was that it (she?) was surprisingly a good girl. Came as asked, sat as asked. Easy to train. It also required no sustenance—no food, no water—we tried to give it some dog food we got at the supermarket and it didn’t eat any of it.\n\nThat also meant Violet didn’t poop everywhere. My mum was grateful for that.\n\nWhile Violet won the rest of my family over, I wasn’t as sure. Violet limped around the house like it quite did not know how. Every joint sounded like a rusty tin can; every twist of the neck threatened to pop out its head. \n\nIt gave me the willies.\n\nI remember wearing gloves while petting it. In fact, the whole time Violet was in the house I could not remember taking it off. And to Violet’s credit, it kept trying to win me over too. Snuggling up next to me; snoring at my feet.\n\nFinally, I crumbled.\n\n“You’re a good girl, aren’t you, Violet?” I murmured, stroking its belly. Violet purred like a cat, wagging its tail.\n\nThen I saw a fist, and the next second I knew I was on the ground, gasping for air. Lucky towered over me. His face was as red as a tomato and his brows furrowed like twin thunderclouds. He stomped on my abdomen and I winced.\n\n“Get your filthy hands off my dog!” he screamed.\n\nI stared at him. Lucky had never acted that way before. In fact, he was willing to always share his things. A good brother, of sorts.\n\nBut now he was foaming at his lips and his eyes were rolling round and round his head like a madman.\n\n“Lucky?”\n\nHe kicked me again and I scampered away, whimpering. Then he grabbed Violet and stormed up to his room, slamming the door behind him.\n\nThe tight knot of fear in my stomach unravelled on its way to my mouth and erupted all over the marble floor.\n\nI saw neither boy nor dog for several weeks after that. Lucky refused to go outside for any reason. He would only permit my mother to go upstairs to visit him and give him food. But even after that he stopped accepting food altogether.\n\nWe were all worried about Lucky. It was the subject of hushed conversations during dinner; in the day we averted our eyes and pretended we didn’t know he existed.\n\nBut even then it wasn’t enough. Screams shattered the silence every so often, screams of pain and the cracking of bones. Then it morphed into growls and roars that you could hear from miles around, and sometimes I woke up to those with my hair standing up on end and my breath caught in my throat.\n\nMy parents forbade me to check on Lucky during this time. I wasn’t allowed anywhere near his room. Only my mother went, every day, and I could hear her sobs as she tried to console her son.\n\nThen even then she disappeared. My father cooked, tended to the garden and did chores. I helped. We sat in silence, just the two of us, while ear-splitting sobs and screams and growls and roars chilled me to the bone. I would look up, distracted, while my mind raced with questions and my heart ached with worries about my mother and brother.\n\nBut even my companionship with my dad didn’t last long.\n\nI was sleeping peacefully one Friday evening when his rough hand shook me awake.\n\n“Gemini. GEMINI WIGGINS!”\n\nWhen someone yells my full name it is never good news. Particularly when it is three-thirty in the morning.\n\nI know because the time is imprinted in my mind. The night I rolled over to check the clock, rubbing my eyes.\n\n**03:32 AM**\n\n“Gemini Wiggins! Get up right now!”\n\nEverything was still spinning. The moon was still up, bright and full.\n\n“Huh?” I yawned.\n\n“You need to go.” \n\nHis voice was soft yet urgent, but there was something strange within it, like the crackling of dead leaves under my feet. My vision cleared and I could see my dad’s face staring seriously back at me. \n\nAnd that was enough to jolt me awake.\n\nFor it wasn’t a human staring back.\n\nIt was a dog.\n\nOr maybe half human and half dog.\n\nPurple face. Golden eyes with no pupils. Ears rising slowly up to his head. He was hunched over, his limbs elongating like mad, and purple telemachite spikes erupted from his spine.\n\nI watched, frozen, as bones cracked as his face jutted out into a snout. His glasses fell on the floor next to me and shattered.\n\n“GO!” he roared, grabbing me and throwing me out the bedroom door. He must’ve known this was going to happen in advance, for there was a knapsack waiting for me by the front door.\n\nI stumbled, tripped, grabbed the knapsack and when I got past the doorway I risked a glance back.\n\nThree hulking shadows danced in the shimmering moonlight. The house shook with their roars and thundered with their heavy footsteps.\n\nI fled.\n\n***\n\nLooking back, the rest of the night felt like a dream. I wandered house to house in my pyjamas and knocked on doors. Most of the lights were off and the curtains were closed. Several did not answer the doorbell.\n\nNumbly I simply walked over to the next house. And rang the doorbell again.\n\nIf there was one thing I am grateful to my father for that night, it was that he gave me a heads start. I could hear those beasts at least two houses behind. Roaring and howling and shaking my bones.\n\nThen I heard a crash and the shaking of another house. I stopped—and as if a magnet was calling me—looked.\n\nThe walls of the houses had crumbled under their new claws. Strangled screams pierced the air; even from a distance I could see hulking figures over my wide-eyed neighbour. He screamed again as they went for his throat, and blood exploded in all directions.\n\nThen silence.\n\nThen a growl. Telemachite spikes exploded out of his back.\n\n**More** purple telemachite monsters turned and locked eyes with me.\n\n*Oh god oh god oh god*\n\nI turned and ran, trying not to scream.\n\n*PLEASE let the next house let me in.*\n\nThe doorbell rang. It was the last house on the street.\n\n*Please please PLEASE*\n\nThe door creaked open and an old lady glared back at me. All wrinkles, all frowns. Silvery hair.\n\n“YES???”\n\nIt was turning to dawn, and the crimson sun rose majestically in the east. At the corner of my eye I could see the monsters—countless of them now—stand up on their hind paws and sniff the morning dew. Their eyes caught the sun and they howled in a way that sent chills up my spine.\n\nThen they scattered, several disappearing into trees.\n\n“Spit it out, girl.”\n\nThe old woman was still glaring at me. I withered.\n\n“I—”\n\nWords choked me. For the first time all night I was crying.\n\nSo instead I jerked my head behind me. Luckily there was still a telemachite monster in plain view. It screeched in the sun’s glare, as its purple skin melted like ice on a hot day. Soon there was a telemachite puddle on the pavement.\n\nIt was all the evidence she needed. The old woman nodded, business-like.\n\n“Come in girl. And take off your shoes.”\n\nShe introduced herself as Jenny and it was clear she was living alone. Her house was bare. There were only some chairs, a table, a bed and a dusty baby grand piano. Another doorway led out to what I assumed was the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nI stayed with her for a couple of days. She tried to take care of me even though it had been so long since she had a child. We ate soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and in the evenings we talked. It was a great way to keep our minds off the howls and screams outside, as new victims were swallowed by their bloodlust.\n\nAlthough Jenny had never opened her curtains while I was there, the chaos outside seeped into the primal parts of my brain and stayed there. Even in my dreams, where I would sit, surrounded by my smiling family, before telemachite spikes erupted from bare skin and all over the table.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat.\n\nI asked her a couple of times to tell me about herself. She was mostly quiet though. Just sat and watched me eat. Our conversations mostly focused on me, my family, my school, my hobbies. All the way until dawn.\n\nIt was only a few nights later (and after a lot of prodding) that she finally opened up.\n\nJenny had a son, apparently, who was once in the Army, and he was contracted to work in the mines after an injury forced him to retire from service. He was crushed to death by a huge slab of telemachite a few weeks back and then her husband committed suicide the next morning out of grief.\n\n“Hanged himself,” Jenny had whispered, leaning in close. “I found him.”  I could barely hear her; cracks were starting to zigzag against the walls. My blood curdled when I realised we were probably the only two left.\n\nThe monsters howled again, and the house shook as they threw their weight on the house. The tips of their claws poked into the wallpaper.\n\n“They’ve moved me out since,” Jenny continued. “Into this tiny little house where no one can see.” She was staring intently at me, her voice way too steady. I wondered if she knew monsters were destroying her house. She was doing her best not to look.\n\nI didn’t want to look either. The roars and howls were enough. Still dust was fluttering gracefully to the floor. Every word sounded like they produced an earthquake.\n\n“It’s been just me since,” Jenny said calmly. She smiled weakly. \n\n“Until you came, of course.”\n\nThen she swallowed. Sat up. Her ears pricked upwards like a rabbit on the alert.\n\nSeconds passed. Jenny swallowed again.\n\n“They call me,” she said with such finality my heart stopped.\n\nShe walked gracefully towards the wall. Like a swan preparing to take flight. The walls finally gave way to reveal a gaping hole.\n\nI heard what she was hearing. A mix of screeches and growls and barks, like a robotic animal trying to speak English. But there was also something unearthly *beautiful* about those voices lying underneath. Like a siren’s song.\n\nBefore I could stop her she had jumped through the hole and into the hungry telemachite monster mob below. For a second I was tempted to join her, but then I resolutely shook my head and jammed my fingers into my ears.\n\nI turned away then, curling into a ball and burying my head on the bed. I shut my eyes, trying to block out the shrieks and wails and cries of celebration as they feasted. The howls that made me wish I was part of the furniture instead of on it.\n\nFinally I felt the sun’s warmth covering me like a soothing blanket. I finally opened my eyes, only to find the house bathed in a golden light. The hisses of the monsters as they dissipated.\nDawn had arrived. I was saved by the morning.\n\nI already knew it was no use staying here. Part of Jenny’s house was destroyed, and the new hole was more a liability than a form of protection. I found a can of soup and heated it up. After some breakfast, I gathered my things and departed.\n\nThen I walked.\n\nAnd walked.\n\nAnd walked.\n\nI had no idea where I was going at first. Just wandering aimlessly as the sun rose. But it didn’t take long for me to realise I was walking towards the mines. There was the field; there was the spot where we found Violet. There was the spot where it all began, where Lucky and I watched the clouds as happy as the summer stretching out long and thin before us.\n\nThe stairs leading down to the mines were still there. Well-trodden and carved from stone. The darkness beckoned. I hesitated for a bit, knowing the mines were a really dangerous place to be in—but neither was the open air anymore.\n\nSo carefully placing one foot in front of the other I went down the stairs.\n\nOnce upon a time these mines were busy. Miners scuttling to and fro like rats, hefting telemachite crystals to send to the labs. The clink of the pickaxe and shovel or the grunt of a miner as they attempted to dislodge a particular piece of rock. Now it was quiet. Peaceful almost.\n\nIt was uncanny.\n\nI wandered a couple of miles from the entrance before sitting down beside a telemachite slab. My throat was parched and my head was swimming with exhaustion. I closed my eyes, rested, and downed half of my water bottle.\n\nIn school we learned about emergency services. I like to call them the Siren Gang, because they all have sirens on their heads. Back in my old neighbourhood there were everywhere. You couldn’t walk one step without hearing them screech and a policeman wrestling a dealer down the street.\n\nThey were my heroes.\n\nBut could my heroes help me now?\n\nMaybe.\n\nI held my breath as I called. I wasn’t even sure if I could get a reception down here.\n\nThen:\n\n“000, what is your emergency?”\n\n*Yes!*\n\nThe operator was quiet, but understanding. He assured me he would deploy someone right away by helicopter. But he sounded nervous. Twitchy. He whispered his words like they were going to kill him.\n\nThen he hung up.\n\nAll I could do was wait.\n\n***\n\nLook, they have been taking a long, long time. I mean, after twenty minutes of waiting I started writing this; I’m almost done now and they’re STILL not here.\n\nIs Telemachite REALLY in the middle of nowhere? Literally not in any atlas or GPS or chart?\n\nI used to take a rest by leaning against the slab and closing my eyes from time to time. But not any more.\n\nSee, I became aware of a pair of eyes staring at me. One silver, one gold.\n\nIt is breathing against my neck now. My heart is in my throat and shivering in fear.\n\n*How—*\n\nI see the snout. The gleaming eyes set back in its head. The smile, like it is celebrating its genius of finding me here.\n\nIts jaw closes around my arm. \n\nTelemachite spikes ripple along my spine and push itself outwards. My skin is on fire. My vision is blurry, but I’m holding on.\n\nI am staring at my phone now and at the big ‘POST’ button, sucking in another painful breath.\n\nI do hope the rescue services get here soon. Hopefully with a cure.\n[Please hurry …](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[SK]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/)",

        "text": "We smile, that's something humans do some people keep a smile on their face all the time and that's totally normal but what if one day you could ever stop smiling? That's what happened in my town.\n\nMy town, Rostane has failed the test of time, long ago it had a purpose, it was an archeological rich site, with deep blue lakes and even a bottomless pond but now you won't even find it on any map, that's how far we've fallen. The kids and youngsters here want to escape this place and the only school here supports that idea but the ones who left never came back and leave their parents and memories. \n\nMy father and I are farmers, I wanted to be perfect for my father, a figure he could be proud of so I decided to stay and help him rather than abandon him and leave for a city life that I knew was not for me long ago.\n\nWe used to go to the city once a week to deliver any orders we would get and on our way we usually stopped at a bar. It was nothing too special just an old building with an old owner who himself served as a bartender as well as an excellent chef, sometimes we used to stop for apple pies too. We were once coming back and were quite happy as our sales had a huge spike and we even got booked for the season so we decided to celebrate. \n\nI was getting desperate to look back but I knew that the woman was right behind me and my whole gut was against it so I took a sip of my beer and that's when my father returned but his gaze was not on me but on the woman behind me. \n\nMy father rushed to her table and sat down. My father was not a guy who was too interested in other women and he lost his only love, my mother when I was three due to cancer, it was the first time I saw him talking to a woman. I wanted to pull my father away from her but he wasn't even aware that  I was there. \n\nI was eavesdropping on their whole conversation, the lady introduced herself as 'Lyla' and asked him where his wife is but my father never uttered a single word instead he was just staring at her face. Lyla smiled and that's when he uttered for the first time, \"Your smile is...captivating. I am-\"\n\n\"Lost in them?\", she said smiling a little more.\n\nMy father nodded. \n\n\"Now, will you do me a favor Dylan?\", she said. Dylan was my father's name but I don't recall him ever telling her that.\n\n\"Grab the beer bottle on the table ahead of us and smash it on the boy's face, he tried to resist my smile.\", she said and I was about to look back when my father approached my table and picked the beer bottle, I covered my face to protect myself but he was fast enough and when I felt that there is no way I could save myself his hands stopped. \n\n\"I was just joking Dylan.\", the woman said laughing and the whole bar started to laugh, everyone was laughing hard and they weren't even pretending they were all laughing for real, not mechanically nor were they having a sinister laugh they were just..laughing like it was the funniest joke.\n\nThe woman got up and walked out of the bar laughing while all the men escorted her out but my father started to follow her. Everyone was still laughing and almost all the other men started to follow her. I grabbed my father to stop him but he punched me hard enough that I passed out and the last thing I saw was his laugh. \n\nThe next morning the sun was high enough that its rays fell on my eyes and I picked myself up and stumbled to the car but I  had no keys, I tried to call my father or the police for help but there was no signal. \n\nRight beside the road there was a  forest and there were thousands of footsteps at its entrance. I walked a little further when I had to turn on my flashlight. The roof of the trees blocked even the tiniest sunlight from falling into the forest. I decided to return before I saw a shoe, it was my father's I went a little deeper when I saw all the men in the bar hanging upside down on the branch of a tree, their eyes were closed while they were smiling. \n\nI clicked a photo and started to look for my father that's when I got the feeling again that someone was dragging their nails across my spine. I run ahead without looking back but I could hear footsteps fast enough to follow me. After what felt like an hour I fell down a small cliff and lay on the road. The car was about to hit me when it stopped, it was my father and he was laughing. He got out of the car and picked me up, I hugged him but he didn't hug me back.\n\nWe returned to the town in the night but he was laughing all the way to our house. I decided to take him to the doctor in the city the next morning, I got off the car and he drove off to my neighbor's house. He got off the car and got in their house breaking their door. After a moment he returned with my neighbors who were now laughing as well. They took of to another house and within a minute my whole neighborhood was laughing almost in sync. \n\nI rushed to the house to pack my things and leave the town before I get infected by their laughter too. I looked out my window to see if there is anyone who was out there human enough to follow me that's when my eyes met with my neighbor and within a few minutes the whole crowd gathered around my house, laughing. I rushed down and locked all the rooms and the main gate. I also locked my room by slamming my drawer against the door and now I am writing this online before they barge in...If you are reading this, please help me.",

        "text": "So I saw this video on tiktok where they say that if you're getting married in a dream you're marrying the dead or something around those lines. \n\nI 18M now, had this dream back around the year 2020 or so where I was getting married with this girl, I'm not really sure what she looked like but the thing that was messed up was that she actually looked dead, like you could see her bones and a bit of flesh kind of similar to the cartoon called \"Corpse Bride\" which I'm sure some of y'all have seen. \n\nThe dream continued and for some reason I actually felt like I was in love with this girl (i know desperate much smh) and in that same dream my family was trying to ruin my marriage with her but I was telling them I was in love and all those dumb reasons, even though they tried to break off the marriage, I remembered we moved from place to place trying to find somewhere peaceful to get married since my family always got in the way. I honestly don't know what was going through my mind at that time but I really did have a whole life with this corpse even though I knew she was one I was still madly in love and when I woke up that early morning around 2-3 it was hard to go back to sleep since the atmosphere in my room felt a bit off (kind of like you we're being watched) but that was one dream I won't be forgetting. \n\nAlso note when I said \"I really did have a whole life with this corpse\" I didn't mean family as with kids lol just to make sure we're all on the same page here. Sometimes I wonder why I even had that dream in the first place and no it's not that I was desperate for a relationship or something and no it's not hard finding a relationship for myself I'm a pretty decent looking guy I'd say at least a 7/10 I was only single at that time because I wasn't really into having a whole relationship thing and would rather just play it off as \"close friends\" instead. \n\nFast foward to when I found that tiktok video a year later, I was creeped out about it. First of all I remembered the dream which means there was a reason like people always say and second the tiktok saying \"getting married in your dream means your marrying the dead\" but what if I'm already married to this dead smh, who knows if she's probably still watching me right now, I know this sounds like one messed up hilarious dream though but damn she better not haunt my future bride lol. (Also yes I know tiktok can be making things up, but just saying this is one messed up dream I won't be forgetting)\n\nAfter going through that dream it took me at least a few days until I was able to get rid of that weird feeling that I always had when I was sleeping but just thinking about it kind of just reminds me of those times when it did happen. \n\nI mean I do hope I'm not the only one that has been through the same situation such as this and please if you have, do say it in the comments so I know I'm not alone with this and hopefully share how your experience was when it did happen, if not then if any of you know exactly why I would have such a dream like this then please do explain. 🜲",

        "text": " \n\nElizabeth and I stood at the edge of the lake. The water was still, small currents crawling with the cold winter breeze.\n\n“It’s almost the New Years.”, she said between skipping flat rocks on the murky water.\n\nI looked at her for a moment, her bright blue eyes following each of the ripples her stones made. Something about the way she said it seemed nervous, as if she had a million things to say but not enough words to put them together.\n\n“Yeah,” I replied \n\n“Almost.”\n\nI, too, now reaching for a rock to chuck.\n\n“My dad said it's old granny’s turn to go.”\n\nShe sighed sympathetically, looking blankly at the looming dark clouds.\n\n“Oh, she was sweet… You're going to miss her, huh?”\n\nNodding in response, I turned back to face Elizabeth again.\n\n“What about you?”\n\nHer fingers tucked back a lock of pretty blonde hair behind her ear. A nervous habit she had since we were kids.\n\n“Well, I never asked.”\n\nMy eyebrow raised a little in confusion.\n\n“Never asked?”\n\n“Mhm”, she murmured softly, getting up from where we sat. Dry bits of leaves and dirt clinging to the butt of her denim jeans. \n\n“I’m probably gonna head home now, it’s getting dark.”\n\nHer pale hands dusted off the small clumps of debris.\n\n“Okay then…” I said, sensing her reluctance to elaborate.\n\n“Text me yeah?”\n\n“I will.” \n\nWe live in a small town that is pretty much forgotten. You would have a hard time finding it with all the GPS technology in the world. It is pretty quiet, and has a warm community of people that genuinely care for each other. However, we do have a strange quirk.\n\nYou see, every decade, one person from each family must be sent off to the woods. That would be the last time you see them. It’s a tradition that has probably been going on since before time. I don’t know what happens to them, hell, I don't even know why we really do it. The elders tell us this isn't our land, and we owe the woods for letting us be here. Fair enough, I guess. Last time it was granddad, I was only six, so I barely remember what happened. Though I really do think about him a lot. His old stories of all the mischief my father caused are things I still hold dear to me.\n\nMy phone buzzed as I laid lazily in bed. The Beatles blasting through my pair of headphones while I stared at the ceiling. I sluggishly raised the bright screen to my face, where a notification from Elizabeth stared back at me.\n\n“You up?”\n\n“I’m up”, I replied, leaning my back against the old, creaky headboard.\n\n“Sorry for leaving like that today, I’ve just had a lot on my mind.”\n\n“Ah I see. That’s okay, is all good?”\n\n“Well…that's the thing.”\n\nI watched the three dots dance in the chat for a while before I got another message.\n\n“We don’t have anyone to give to the woods.”\n\nI thought for a second, realizing she was right. Most families usually send off the elders. Those who've seen all that life has to offer, and are brave enough to make the sacrifice. Elizabeth, however, stayed with her dad and two siblings. I always assumed they might have a distant relative that stayed somewhere else in town, but that was apparently not the case.\n\n“Jason…”\n\nIt was weird seeing her use my full name, we never did that, this felt uncomfortably different.\n\n“Last time it was mum… Dad promised her we would move. Far away from this place, so nothing could hurt us. But the woods…she has a way of keeping you here. He tried, I know he did. We just don’t have the money, nor anywhere else that would take us.”\n\nA breath caught inside my chest. Something in me knew where this was going, but I couldn’t bare to think of it as true.\n\n“It’s going to have to be me…”\n\nWe met again by the lake. The wind now howling in protest, pushing the water into small waves against the shore. \n\n“What if you don’t go?”\n\nI said to Elizabeth, already knowing the answer.\n\n“And risk my whole family dying?”\n\nShe picked at the skin around her fingers anxiously, her cheeks rosy pink from the biting cold.\n\n“Liz…” I groaned,\n\n“I can’t let you die.” \n\nShe raised her head, looking just as pretty as she always has despite the tears in her eyes.\n\n“I have no choice.”\n\nWe both sat in silence, watching the clouds swirl into intimidating shapes before us. New Year's Eve was tonight, and this was possibly our last time together. I lifted my hand, slowly placing it over Elizabeth’s. Our fingers locked tightly, hers a thousand times colder than mine. \n\n“You know I love you, Liz.”, the words came out without me even thinking about them.\n\n“I love you too.”\n\nThat night, my family and I had a big feast for grandma. We all talked about the times we spent with her, and she repeated how much she was going to miss all of us. Despite my sadness over losing grandma, the greater loss of Elizabeth plagued my conscious.\n\n“She doesn’t deserve this.”, I thought.\n\n“Her life has barely started, this isn’t fair.”\n\nAs the clock struck eleven thirty, two men came to our door. \n\n“We’re here for your offering.”, the tallest of them said. His voice deep and tired. \n\nGrandma hugged each one of us, giving me a special wet kiss on the forehead.\n\n“I’ll miss you, Nana.” I said, wiping a tear away.\n\n“My baby, keep chasing your dreams. Nothing in the world is strong enough to take away what you deserve.” And just like that, she walked out the door, with one hand on the man’s shoulder to support her fragile legs.\n\nHer words rang in my head, \n\n“Nothing in the world is strong enough to take away what you deserve.”\n\nAs everyone retreated to their bedrooms, some with grieving sobs, I headed towards our basement. Grabbing my grandfather’s old combat knife and a flashlight, which I tucked into the waistband of my sweatpants. I crawled as quietly as I could out of the top window and followed the direction those men took my grandma.\n\n“I’m coming for you, Liz.” \n\nThe walk took around 15 minutes. I had eventually caught up to the men and carefully tiptoed behind them. We were walking further away from the town, closer to the forest’s edge. Ear-splitting roars of thunder tore through the otherwise silent night. Ivory lighting illuminating the dirt streets, giving birth to shadows that stretched far into the darkness. At the end of our walk sat a group of at least fifty people. They were lined up in front of the forest, none of them daring to speak. The men stood my grandma at the end of the line and then walked off into a different direction. A strange old man stood in front of the crowd, his hair gray and thin. His messy beard stretched almost as far as his belly button. In his hand was a medieval torch, the ones that are lit on fire. He waited for the men to walk away before beginning to speak. I was hiding behind a thick tree, just close enough to make out what he was saying.\n\n“Hello, my people, today is an important day for all of you.”, his voice was soft and comforting, reminding me a lot of my grandfather’s.\n\n“Your sacrifice will give your family a chance at life. A chance to succeed. And it will spare them of any misery so long as they stay here. It is now time for each of you to pay your dues, to give the woods her thanks. I wish you all a great journey, till we meet again.”, he stuck the torch into the soft dirt and then began walking away in the same direction the men did. Just like that, we were all alone. My grandma was ahead of everyone, and she was the first to walk into the woods. The torch only illuminated her for so long before she disappeared. Everyone waited silently for a few minutes, before the next person followed. \n\nI scanned the group of people before spotting Elizabeth. She was standing nervously behind an old woman, her eyes locked onto the dirt below her. I slowly inched towards the crowd and planted myself next to Elizabeth. \n\n*“Hey, Liz…”,* I whispered. Her head jerked up, it took a moment for her to figure out what was happening and when she did, I felt a hard fist shoved into my gut. \n\n“What the fuck is wrong with you.”, she whispered back, with venom sting behind every word.\n\n“What do you think? I’m going in with you, and we’re getting out of here. Alive.” I replied, rubbing my stomach where she had punched me.\n\n“Are you stupid Jason?? You are turning your ass back right fucking now.” \n\n“No. No I’m not. Liz, I told you I can’t let you die. We have done everything together since we met. I was too stupid to tell you how much you meant to me, there is still so much left to say. I’m not letting you go this easy. And before you scream at me even more, there’s nothing you can do to change my mind. You hear me?”\n\nShe looked at me with fire burning behind her ocean eyes, but knew there was nothing she could do to make me reevaluate. \n\n“Do you even have a plan?” \n\nI stroked my chin jokingly,\n\n“Not die, for starters.”\n\nElizabeth rolled her eyes before hugging me.\n\n“I hate you, asshole.”\n\nThe line moved quick, and eventually we were the only ones left to go in. Elizabeth and I looked at each other for a second before taking our first steps into the pitch black woods.\n\nI immediately pulled out my flashlight and pointed it forwards. There was a trail that cut through the trees, leading you deeper into the woods. At this point, little drops of rain fell from the sky, bringing with it the sweet smell of wet soil. Neither of us said a word, but the terror we felt was eminent by how deep our breaths were. Eventually the trail led to an open field. Something shined with the reflection of my flashlight. Something dark, and wet…\n\n“Blood…” Elizabeth murmured. Tons of it. The entire patch of dried grass was soaked in crimson blood, inch deep claw marks etched onto the neighboring trees. It looked as if a massacre had occurred in that very spot just a few minutes before we got there. As we tried processing the gorey sight, a branch snapped, beckoning our attention. I turned the beam of light to the source of the sound, just to find nothing but a plain old tree. That’s when a severed hand fell from somewhere in the branches and hit the forest floor with a wet thud. \n\n“RUN!!”, I screamed at Elizabeth, and we both took off back down the trail. I could hear the snapping of branches in the tress as some entity chased behind us. We sprinted, narrowly avoiding every protruding root that could trip us. After running for a few minutes, to our horror, we end up right back where we started. In front of the bloody grass. We both stopped, gasping for air as our lungs screamed in agony. The creature leaped from above us, landing in the middle of the opening. It was horrifying. Long slender arms dangled till its knees. Long claws stained with blood hung from each of its digits. It had no eyes, instead a massive opening, almost as if the empty eye socket of a cyclops, underneath which a wide mouth sat agape. Showing us, it’s fangs that we’re the size of our forearm. The creature cocked its head to the side, like a curious child. The rain now pouring violently onto us. Making its silhouette blend into the background. The monster let out a guttural moan before charging at us. I grabbed Elizabeth’s arm and ducked behind a tree. It ran right past us before jumping into the trees and dashing forwards.\n\n“What the fuck is that…”, Elizabeth said between sharp inhales.\n\n“Fuck if I know.”, I said, equally exhausted.\n\n“Listen, we don’t have much time. It’s going to come back and find us if we just sit here.”, I reached for my hip, pulling out the combat knife. \n\n“We have to try something.”, Elizabeth looked down towards the blade and then back at me. \n\n“You want to try to kill it?”\n\n“It’s the only option we have.” I said.\n\n“Look, you need to grab its attention.”, I pointed towards the opening.\n\n“I need you to make some noise, okay, leave the rest to me.” \n\nElizabeth swallowed hard, as she wiped the sweat off her forehead. She stood up and faced the opening.\n\n“I love you. Don’t fucking die on me”, she said softly before walking away.\n\nAs she made her way to the grass, I climbed the tree we were sat under. Finding a sturdy branch, I crouched on it, positioning myself towards Elizabeth. My cousins and I used to play hide and seek all the time, and I would jump onto them from the oak tree in our backyard. Never did I think that skill would come in handy.\n\nElizabeth stood frozen for a second, the rain beating against her face, before letting out a loud,\n\n“I’M HERE, FUCK FACE.”, almost immediately a screech echoed from the woods, and we could hear the creature making its way towards us.\n\nIt was out of the trees and sprinted on it’s thin but long legs, dragging the massive claws behind it. I watched as it tackled Elizabeth to the ground, her screams sending fear into my bones. In an instant, I pounced on the being, digging the blade deep into its spine. It stood up, howling in pain, but I refused to let it shake me off. Pulling the blade out, I used its shoulder as leverage, and plunged it deep into its neck. This time it could only muster a tiny gurgle before falling onto its belly. I rolled off the thing's back, finding my self right next to Elizabeth. We were both panting, and I felt a suffocating sense of darkness smothering me. Before I knew it, we were both passed out.\n\nThe sun burnt through my eyelids, which slowly fluttered open. In front of me was the blurry face of an old man. The recollection of what happened kicked in, and I sprung up, frantically searching for Elizabeth. \n\n“Calm down young man. She’s over there.”, I turned to see her perched up against a tree, wrapped in a cozy looking woolen blanket. The old man, who I now recognized as the same one who was speaking to everyone before we walked into the woods, spoke to me again.\n\n“You’ve done something outrageous. I am still confused as to how you pulled it off. But nevertheless, the longer you’re here, the more likely you won’t live to see another day.”, the man extended his arm, helping me get onto my feet.\n\n“What you killed was her child, you murdered the wood's own flesh. You must run, take her with you.”\n\nHe pointed a thin, wrinkled finger towards Elizabeth.\n\n“What about our family?” I questioned. \n\nHe looked at me with cold eyes, as if he hadn’t slept for eons.\n\n“Don’t worry, son, we will look after them. They won’t stay here either, but leaving for them won’t be so simple. There are a few things that must be done, but I assure you. I will get them out of here.”\n\nI didn’t know if I should have thanked the man for his help, or apologized for the inconvenience we caused. I decided on a plain nod, before picking up Elizabeth and walking away.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since that day. Elizabeth and I moved far, far away from that town. We have been together ever since, now with a little daughter joining us as well. Our families, to that man’s word, did end up moving out as well. We haven’t been back since, nor do we plan on it. However, I do still dream of those woods, and she calls for me, she calls for me to face her like a man. Maybe I will go back, but for now, I’m happy in Elizabeth’s arms.",

        "text": "We found the plans online.\n\nMy best friend Lilith and I have always been interested in the macabre. (Ok, her real name isn’t Lilith, it’s Katie. But I call her Lilith.) Our parents think we’re “goth,” but we’re not. Those are the kids that wear too much eyeliner and write cringey depressed poems. We do cooler stuff, like hold seances and read dark magic spellbooks and obsess over the Salem witches.\n\nSo when Lilith found plans online to summon Satan, I was SO excited.\n\n“Are we seriously going to try to summon *Satan?!*” I whispered, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n“Why not?” Lilith answered, as she pulled out her phone and brought up the plans. “It’s easy. We just have to draw this giant pentagram on the floor… and say this stuff in French…”\n\n“That’s *Latin,*” I corrected.\n\n“Latin. What*ever.* Nerd.” She rolled her eyes at me. “And then we write ‘SATAN’ in blood in the middle of the pentagram.”\n\n“That sounds too easy,” I said, frowning. “If it was that easy, wouldn’t everyone summon Satan like all the time?”\n\n“You think normies want to summon Satan?”\n\n“No…”\n\nShe unzipped her bag and pulled out a black Sharpie. “Then let’s get to work.”\n\nIt was hard work. My room has a really fluffy carpet, so I had to draw each stroke several times over before it was actually visible. “Are you sure this comes out with soap? My mom will *kill* me.”\n\n“Shut up and keep drawing,” she replied, furiously scribbling with the marker.\n\nAfter twenty minutes or so, we were finally done. I stood up and admired our handiwork: a pentagram in a circle, with several strange symbols inside each cavity of the pentagram. It looked good. Part of me hoped it wouldn’t wash out—how mad would Mom be if I had a literal SATAN SUMMONING CIRCLE on my bedroom floor?\n\nOoooh. That would *really* get her goat. And she totally deserved it, after not letting me go to Sadie’s sleepover. I swear, sometimes I was so mad at her I wanted her to die.\n\n“Okay. Now the Latin stuff.” Lilith pulled out her phone and began to read. “*Ego te voco…*” She read the entire thing, terribly. I mean I don’t know Latin but listening to it was painful.\n\n“Now the blood,” I said, scowling. “Wait. Did you bring blood?”\n\nShe tapped her arm. “We use our own blood, silly.”\n\n“Like we actually have to cut ourselves?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“I dunno, Lil. That sounds kind of… extreme.”\n\n“Don’t be such a baby,” she said. And then, before I could stop her, she grabbed my hand and knicked my palm with the scissors she’d been hiding in her sleeve.\n\n“LILITH!” I shouted. “What the *hell* are you doing?!”\n\n“Stop wasting time. We gotta do it before the blood dries up.” She reached out for my hand. “Here. You write the first three letters and I’ll write the last two. Saves time.”\n\nI was mad, but she was right. We were running out of time.\n\nWe bent over the carpet and got to work.\n\nWriting stuff in blood is totally overrated. They make it sound like this cool soulbinding thing but it actually sucks. My hand was stinging and writing just that first letter, *S,* was enough that I needed a break. *Why didn’t we use Lilith’s blood?!* I thought as I closed my eyes, breathing hard, trying not to focus on the pain. Then I sucked in a breath and got back to work, sticking my finger against my palm and writing the *T*.\n\nBreathless, we both got up and stepped away from the circle.\n\nAnd that’s when we saw it.\n\n“You *idiot!”* Lilith said. “You forgot the *A!”*\n\nShe was right. The letters in blood read *STAN.*\n\n“Oh no. Uh, I’ll fix it.” I looked down at the wound on my hand—but it’d stopped bleeding. “It’s dried up. Get the scissors and cut your hand—”\n\n“I’m not cutting my hand!”\n\n“Are you serious?! You literally STABBED me!”\n\n“Just squeeze your hand and more blood will come out.”\n\n“I don’t want to! It—”\n\nWe were both cut off by a low humming sound.\n\nWe both turned to the circle, our hearts pounding. “Holy shit,” I whispered, as the Sharpie-engraved pentagram began to glow. Dim red light that pulsed like a heartbeat; then faster and faster, brighter and brighter, as a horrible roar rushed in our ears—\n\n*POP.*\n\nWe both stared, mouths agape.\n\nThere was not a demon in the center of the circle. Not a leather-skinned, fiery-eyed, red-horned creature from the depths of hell.\n\nNo… there was just a guy.\n\nAn average-looking white guy. Maybe in his twenties or early thirties. He was wearing a gray T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. There was stubble on his jaw and his hair was kind of messy.\n\n“You called me?” he asked.\n\nLilith and I stared at each other. I made an unintelligible stuttering noise.\n\n“I’m Stan,” he said. Then he let out a yawn that exposed his yellowed, crooked teeth. “You need help or something?”\n\n“How—how did you get in here?” I finally asked, composing myself.\n\n“You summoned me.”\n\n“Um,” Lilith interjected. “We were TRYING to summon SATAN.”\n\n“Oh. Common mistake. That pesky little extra ‘A’, huh?”\n\nI backed away, still staring in horror at this man who had just popped out of thin air. I wanted to believe that this guy had somehow broken in. Maybe climbed in through a window while I wasn’t looking. But the truth is, I *was* looking. And I saw him just *appear,* right there, in the middle of the circle.\n\n*Lilith and I never should’ve gotten involved in this stuff,* I thought. I felt like I was going to throw up. *It was fun to talk about demons and dark magic and Salem witches… when, deep down, I didn’t ACTUALLY believe any of it. But now… I just saw a man pop out of thin air. Just like that.* “Maybe… maybe I should call my parents,” I stuttered to Lilith.\n\n“You’ll be grounded forever.”\n\nThat was true. I *would* be grounded forever. Maybe we could just… get rid of him somehow. “Hey, um, my mom has some really expensive jewelry in her room. Why don’t you just take that… and leave?”\n\n“I don’t really need the money,” he replied in his nasally voice. “But thanks anyway.”\n\n“Um. Well, you can’t stay here.”\n\n“I like your room,” he said, ignoring my comment. “Is that a Black Sabbath CD? Your parents let you listen to that? What are you, like, 14?”\n\n“Uh…”\n\n“I mean, that’s cool to have permissive parents,” Stan said, shrugging. “I guess I should’ve guessed that, since they let you draw a pentagram on the floor and all.”\n\n“They’re not permissive,” I replied quietly.\n\n“You’re just good at hiding stuff then, yeah?”\n\nHe stepped out of the pentagram and started towards my desk. Picked up the Black Sabbath CD, then pulled out a drawer and rummaged through some of the contents. “Mmm. These are awesome,” he said, holding up one of my Milky Pens. “Love these things. You probably got ‘em ‘cause they draw on black paper, right? So you can have a whole, like, goth journal?”\n\nLilith and I stared at him, speechless.\n\n“We’re not goth,” Lilith finally whispered.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, emo or something though right?” He let out a laugh. “You gotta be *something* to try and summon Satan.”\n\nLilith turned to me as he bent over the other desk drawer. “We’ve got to get him out of here. He’s probably dangerous. And if your parents see him…”\n\nI nodded. Slowly, I took a step towards him, standing as straight as I possibly could. “Listen. I’m sorry Stan, but you have to leave. My dad has a rifle and he’ll shoot you as soon as he gets back—”\n\nLilith jabbed me in the ribs. “*Don’t—tell—him—we’re—home—alone,”* she whispered through gritted teeth.\n\n“—And my older brother is napping in the basement. He’s going to come up and beat the crap out of you. So you better go.”\n\nStan finally stopped rummaging in the drawer.\n\nSlowly, he turned around. Straightened up before me. Then his mouth stretched into a grin that showed off his yellow teeth.\n\n“But you don’t have a brother, Ava.”\n\nMy heart dropped. I looked at Lilith—she looked back at me. And then as if communicating by telepathy, we both raced for the door at the same time.\n\nSurprisingly he didn’t follow us as we raced down the stairs. Panting, I grabbed Lilith’s hand and dragged her towards the kitchen, towards the sliding glass door. We could run right to the Thompson’s on the other side, tell them someone had broken in—\n\nI skidded to a stop.\n\nThe refrigerator door hung open. And underneath the crack, I spotted his dirty white sneakers.\n\n“Going so soon?” Stan asked, as he swung the door closed. “Hey, do you have anything good to eat around here? Maybe those little, like, puffed cheese things with the cheetah on the bag?”\n\nWe backed away.\n\n“Hey. Listen now. You two are the ones who summoned *me,*” he said. “You’re not going to just kick me out, are you?”\n\n“Will you go if I give you Cheetos?” I asked in a small voice.\n\nHe shrugged. “Maybe. Why, you have any?”\n\nI ducked into the pantry, grabbed the orange bag, and blindly threw it at him. “Here! Now *get out!”*\n\n“Now wait a second,” he said, plopping down on a chair, propping his feet up on the kitchen table. He opened the bag with a loud *POP.* “If you were summoning Satan, you were clearly trying to make a deal with him. Right?” He threw some Cheetos in his mouth and crunched on them loudly. “I want that same deal.”\n\n“We were just summoning Satan for fun—”\n\n“Yeah, right.” *Crunch, crunch.* “So what was the deal going to be? What did you want?”\n\nLilith and I glanced at each other.\n\nFor a long moment, there was silence. Stan staring expectantly at both of us; Lilith and I glancing nervously at each other. Finally, I sucked in a shuddering breath.\n\n“Please. Go,” I choked out.\n\n“Alrighty then.” He held up his cheese-covered hands in surrender. “Y’know, I was just trying to be polite. Offer my services. Make sure you got something out of that whole summoning business. But I’ll go. Plain and simple.”\n\nAnd with that, he got up and walked out of the kitchen. A second later, I heard the door swing open and slam shut.\n\nLilith and I stared at each other in silence.\n\nWe only moved when the shrill ring of the telephone jolted through the silence. I glanced over—no one ever called the home phone anymore. We only kept it around for my dad’s long business calls, really. But it was nine o’clock—too late for that.\n\nI stepped towards the phone, confused, and slowly picked it up. “Hello?” I asked in a soft voice.\n\n“Ava?” The voice on the other end of the line was shaking, but I recognized it immediately. It was my sister, Sam.\n\n“Sam?”\n\n“I’m so sorry,” she said, through breaking sobs. “But they just… they just told me… it’s Mom and Dad.” She sucked in a breath. “They got in a terrible accident on Route 40. Dad’s being airlifted to the hospital but Mom… Mom…”\n\nMy heart sunk.\n\n“She’s dead, Ava.”\n\nThe phone fell from my hands and clattered on the floor.\n\nBut all I could picture in my head was Stan. With his yellowed grin and steel-gray eyes.\n\nSmugly smiling at providing his [‘services.’](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

        "text": "I work at a clothing store. It’s one of those high-end, spend $100 for a t-shirt type place. We cater to people from many walks of life, but mostly, rich assholes who think they know everything. I honestly wasn’t sure why I was accepted when they hired me. My last job was working at a dog groomer before the pandemic. I had absolutely no knowledge of fashion, yet the manager, Daniel, seemed to really like my personality and offered me the position after only two interviews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This position is part time,” he explained, “so most of the people we’ve had have moved on after a few months, whether it be for college or out of boredom. It isn’t the most exciting line of work, but I think you would really thrive in a shop like this!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis made sense at the time, and his enthusiasm soothed my worries. Looking back, I now see why it is almost impossible to find someone willing to put up with our more eccentric clientele.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started, it seemed like the perfect job for me. I genuinely love customer service (I know, it’s weird), and helping people find clothing that makes them comfortable and confident always made me feel a sense of pride, even if they were pretentious and scoffed at the clothes I wore. However, there were some red flags that, in retrospect, should have been a clear sign as to what our shop really does. First, we don’t really have a lot of products in-store. Most of our pieces are marketed as “limited edition” or “exclusive,” so there really isn’t a whole lot of options, but people *love* finding something only they can have. For some of my clients, I am able to build outfits for them and they can leave with arms full of bags, like your typical shopping spree. The weird part is, we have an entire custom clothing service. We have everything you’d need to get fully measured, different fabric swatches (that I wasn’t allowed to touch or even look at) to pick from, and an entire system for ordering specialty items and sizes. I didn’t really understand why we had all of these tailoring tools in our shop at first, since I had never seen anyone come in for anything custom, and I assumed the biggest draw to our shop was the exclusivity and branding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other very odd business decision is our location. The shop is on the 3rd floor of a nine story building, so we are a bit secluded compared to your average retail store. I always thought this was a strange choice for a store to make, since the very bottom floor of the building is empty, and we would get much more traffic if we moved down. My manager assured me that this was the best spot for us, and I didn’t argue because, well, I don’t care. We get a good amount of people in the store, and word of mouth is an incredible marketing tool. Speaking of marketing, we don’t have any commercials, advertisements on the street, or even a sign on our building. We don’t have a website, and our location on Google maps says “permanently closed.” (I’ve brought this up to Daniel multiple times, but, in his words, ‘it’s safer that way.’) On my first day, I could barely find the shop. Word of mouth really is the only way people are able to find us, unless they are willing to walk into a strange building and ride a tiny elevator up to the third floor out of pure curiosity (which honestly happens more than you’d think). Despite actually having an elevator, my coworkers and I aren’t allowed to use it. I always assumed it was some weird company policy to make us seem more professional, and since Daniel said the elevator automatically locks when we’re closed, I never really thought about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was until about my second month on the job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was closing a little later than usual with Daniel, when I heard the elevator doors open. Our shop closes at 7 p.m., so I thought someone had caught the elevator before it locked. This had never happened before, but with the type of people we cater to, I wasn’t surprised they would do something like this. I quietly groaned to myself and looked at Daniel, who I assumed would share my annoyance. Instead, his face completely drained, and he started sweating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Get in the office,” he hissed at me, “Lock the door. Don’t come back out until I say.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis caught me off guard, as Daniel had always been a super easy-going guy. I’d never heard him panic, even in the biggest of rushes, and he’d certainly never spoken to me so sharply. In my moment of hesitation, I heard the front doors open, and he quickly shoved me in the back and closed the curtain separating the tiny stockroom from the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first thought was we were being robbed. I ran into the back office, quietly closed the door, and pulled out my phone to call the police. Before I could even start dialing, I heard my manager’s cheery customer service voice:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello, sir! Great to see you again. How can I help you this evening?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, waiting for some sort of response, but only heard my own heart pounding in my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Absolutely! We just got some new fabrics in that I think you’ll totally love. Let me grab the swatches for you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard Daniel walk to the stockroom, rustle around in some boxes I assumed was the newest shipment of swatches I wasn't allowed to touch, then quickly walk back. I decided against calling the police, as I was still new and didn’t want to risk making a scene, since Daniel seemed unphased by this visitor. After about an hour of listening to him having a seemingly one-sided conversation, I finally heard him say goodbye and lock the front doors. He came back and opened the office door, clearly exhausted and still wearing the tailor’s tape around his neck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m so sorry about that,” he sighed defeatedly. “I didn’t mean to snap at you. You are an amazing employee, but I don’t think you’re ready to get into the custom side of the business yet. I don’t want to scare you off.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t know what to say, and seeing my manager so thoroughly drained, I decided to save my questions for tomorrow. I said it was fine, clocked out, made my way down the 3 flights of stairs as quickly as I could, basically sprinting to the bus stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, I got in to see that Daniel had done all of my opening tasks for me. Surprised, I walked into the back office to find him holding a coffee for me as well. I didn’t know him well enough yet to tell him I can’t stand coffee, so I took it and thanked him, taking a small, bitter sip to not seem ungrateful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I guess I have some explaining to do,” he started, and took a large gulp of his own drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This store is extremely special. We help a lot of people find clothes that might not be able to otherwise.” (This statement confused me, as I always assumed the people I helped were well-off and just wanted to spend some money, but I decided not to interrupt.) “As you now know, we also make custom clothing for those with… unusual needs.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paused to take another sip, and I felt myself holding my breath for some reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Tonight, after we close, I would like you to stay and work the off hours with me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must have been visibly confused, because he hesitated a moment before continuing. “The shop closes at seven o’clock. But, from seven to ten, we are open for our custom services. We offer this to our more *unique* customers who don’t fit into the typical sizing of retail clothing,” he said slowly. “We have an appointment tonight at 7:30 with one of my regular clients. He is the gentleman that came by last night. I wasn’t expecting a surprise visit from him, but he managed to sneak past the barrier before the elevator locked. He has an appointment tonight to finish up his measurements and finalize his purchase. I want you to shadow me so you can learn the basics.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took one last swig of his coffee before tossing the cup in the trash and standing up. “Also, you don’t happen to understand sign language, do you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I wasn’t already stressed enough about starting a new job, I was completely shaken after my conversation with Daniel. I had more questions than I knew what to do with, so I decided to just keep my mouth shut and see what would happen. At 7:25, I was basically numb with anxiety, just waiting for whoever this person was to show up so we could get this over with. I was aware I’d be getting overtime pay for this, which was the only thing keeping me from fleeing, but I couldn’t shake the feeling something extremely horrifying was about to walk through the doors. Of course, I was right. At 7:30 on the dot, I heard the elevator doors open. Daniel rushed out from the back and gave me a reassuring but nervous look before turning to the front doors as they opened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Koro! It’s great to see you again, sir! I’d like you to meet our newest employee, Harper.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel had talked me through some basics of what was about to happen, how to measure 'irregular' body types, and explained how it was imperative that I was extremely polite, but nothing he said could have prepared me for what I was about to see. When I turned to face the client who had entered the shop, I screamed louder than I have ever screamed before, and instantly blacked out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow look, I am no stranger to horror. There is nothing I love more than curling up on the couch on a rainy day and watching a good scary movie, but I am also an *extremely scared* person. For every horror movie I watch, I need to watch at least twice as many cartoons, or old Pixar movies, or random YouTube videos to calm my mind. I am terrified of the dark, and still sleep with a nightlight (and I’m not ashamed of it!!). I love scary things, but being scared? Absolutely not. So when I came to and saw ‘Koro’ standing over me, I almost passed out again. This creature seemed to stand at least eight feet tall, had almost translucent skin, and no face. And I don’t mean like Slenderman-type where there are indents where a nose and eyes should be, I mean flat as paper, nothing was ever meant to be there. Weirdest of all, despite having no distinct features at all, he seemed to have human ears. These, unlike the rest of his too-smooth face, were horribly misshapen, almost as if they had been severely burned or crudely cut off and sewn back on. He was wearing a navy suit that was just as translucent as his skin, and the way the light filtered through his entire body made my head spin again. I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. He turned his head slightly when he noticed me staring, as if he was studying me, but Daniel’s face quickly blocked my view and brought me back to reality. In a daze, I felt him carry me into the office and carefully lay me on the chair before writing a quick note and closing the door. I sat for a moment with my eyes closed, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. I almost convinced myself it was in my head, until I saw the note Daniel had left me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I should have warned you, I’m so sorry. Please stay here until he leaves. I am worried you have offended him. Don’t worry, we are old friends, so you are safe. I will come back with some coffee once he’s left.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat, more coffee, I thought, as I leaned against the back of the chair. A moment passed, then I fully processed what I had just read, and instantly felt fear knot in my stomach. What did he mean by ‘*you are safe*’? Was there a chance I wouldn’t be safe? I felt myself getting lightheaded again, so I pushed the thought aside, rubbing my head that had slammed into the hardwood floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter another anxious hour of hearing my manager have a one sided conversation with ‘Koro,’ he softly knocked on the office door and peaked it, holding a white coffee cup as a peace offering. I took it silently and allowed him to sit down across from me. He once again looked completely exhausted. It seemed like working with this particular “client” really took it out of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m really sorry for what happened back there,” he started, but I cut him off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Daniel, what the FUCK did I just see? How could you not tell me about this?!” I yelled, a little too loud. He looked slightly hurt, and I immediately felt guilty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“That’s fair, I deserve that,” he sighed and rubbed his forehead. “I didn’t know how to properly explain this to you. The last person I tried to warn before getting into custom thought it was a joke and… well, they really upset a client that isn’t as forgiving as Koro.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt myself start to panic, wondering what he meant by that and remembering his note, but he quickly moved on, trying to cover up what he had just said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I understand that this won’t work for you anymore, and you are more than welcome to use me as a reference on your resume. I promise to only give you glowing recommendations.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, are you firing me??” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I felt myself start to panic. “I’m sorry I swore at you, I didn’t mean to yell, I really do love this job and I’m sorry I offended your… friend, I just didn’t know what to expect, I’ll do better next time-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel held up his hand to stop me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, you’re not quitting?” He looked genuinely shocked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“In this economy? Fuck no,” I said quickly, and cringed at myself for once again swearing in front of my manager.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe let out a deep laugh, and looked at me with what seemed to be both respect and pity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, we won’t do any more customs for you for a bit, but if you are going to stay here, you’ll have to do them eventually. It’s a big part of the job.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought about this for a moment, and decided that I had overreacted to what I saw. Maybe I was gaslighting myself, but after an hour of hearing my manager talk to himself, I was pretty convinced I hadn’t actually seen what I thought. Besides, I *had* hit my head pretty hard on the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Let me try again tomorrow,” I said, way more confidently than I felt. “I can do this. Is Koro coming back?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He won’t be back until next week when his new suit arrives,” he said gently. “Why don’t we try again then?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was kind of disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to prove myself for another week, and thought about arguing that I could shadow him with other clients, but I decided to let Daniel call the shots here. I didn’t want to embarrass myself again, or possibly suffer another concussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where you might be thinking, \"Why do you feel like you need to prove yourself to a boss that introduced you to a monster? Why didn't you run away? What the fuck is wrong with you?\" etc. Look, I don't have the answers to those questions. I like to be viewed as capable, and having to be physically carried away from a client (albeit the scariest client I had ever seen) by my manager was humiliating. I desperately wanted another chance to show I can do this job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next week went by extremely slowly, and dealing with the everyday pretentious client started to drive me crazy. When the day finally arrived that I would work the custom shift, I was actually excited. I had fully convinced myself that I had imagined everything the week before, and I was looking forward to trying my hand at custom fitting. I’m not super passionate about clothing at all, but getting to do something besides helping entitled people find an outfit for their next date was extremely enticing. After we had closed, Daniel sat me down and gave me more of an explanation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Koro is an extremely kind being, if you respect him. Do not look him in the eyes, or where his eyes should be, I guess. Don't stare at him, either. It isn't good for your eyes. He cannot speak, but he can understand us. He uses sign language to communicate, so I hope you’ve been practicing.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took sign language as my mandatory language in high school, and actually retained quite a bit. I had been brushing up over the last week per Daniel’s advice. I nodded, and he continued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Do not ask him any personal questions about himself, and please don't tell him anything personal about yourself. I don’t know what he is exactly, but I have been working with him for over 5 years, and as long as I respect his boundaries, he is extremely pleasant. He’s even kind of funny!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe tried to sound cheery, but his little talk had brought back my anxiety ten-fold, as I realized I had, in fact, seen exactly what I thought that first night. I had no time to process this, though, as we heard the elevator doors open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Let’s do this!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel patted my knee and plastered his customer service smile on his face as I heard the front doors open. He gave his classic greeting, and I took a deep breath before turning around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStanding before me was Koro, exactly as I remembered, although he wasn’t as tall as I had thought, standing maybe six and a half feet. This didn’t help with my very primal fear, as I quickly had to avert my gaze when I noticed the lights glistening through his skin, and tried to hide my shaking\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Koro, I’d like you to meet Harper. Again.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe chuckled uncomfortably, and looked at me as if you say *don’t be fucking rude.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello sir,” I said, swallowing hard. “I apologize for our previous meeting. I wasn’t feeling very well…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t have any excuse prepared, really, as I didn’t think this creature with no eyes would have such an intense stare. He seemed pleased enough with this answer, though, and quickly signed something to me. Daniel laughed nervously, but it was too fast for me to understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What did he say?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel hesitated. “He said ‘It’s alright, I supposed I can forgive you, just this once.’”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt my face pale, and Koro signed something else. He looked at Daniel expectantly when I didn’t understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He says it's time to see what you can do. Your new suit is set up for you in the fitting room, sir.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt Koro glance at me one last time before stepping into the fitting room, and Daniel closed the curtain for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He really is a very nice person, once you get used to him,” he whispered. ”Just give him a chance.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then walked back to the fitting room to make one-sided small talk through the curtain, which I assumed was a habit he couldn’t drop after eight hours of working with clients who did nothing but talk. I took a deep breath to steady myself, and joined Daniel by the mirror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Koro came out, he was wearing a suit I can only describe as void of color. It wasn’t black, it was blacker than black. It was like the paint that guy invented that looks like a black hole, only darker. My brain physically couldn’t comprehend it, and mixed with the translucent figure in front of me, it seemed like I was looking at a shadow cast by nothing, and I had steady myself on the couch. Daniel was busy fussing over the suit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, how does it feel?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKoro signed his response, and I was able to catch a few things, like ‘too long’ and ‘you think?’. Daniel reassured him that the sleeves were a good length, and thought it fit beautifully. Koro seemed to be satisfied, but turned to me and signed, much slower, “What do you think?” I glanced at Daniel, who nodded, and I stepped around Koro, inspecting the suit. I made sure to avoid looking at his face, even though I could tell him was eyeing me carefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I think it fits really well. I wouldn’t mess with the sleeves anymore, you don’t want them to be too short.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKoro signed something a little too fast, and before Daniel could translate, he put up his hand and tried again, slower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thank you for your input. You have a good eye for this. I hope you stick around longer than the last one.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt a chill down my spine as he said this, and turned to Daniel, hoping he would take over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, I’m glad you’re happy! You can go ahead and change back, and I’ll get this wrapped up for you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the bus ride home, I still hadn’t fully comprehended what I had just seen. I knew this would completely change who I was forever, and I really was considering finding another job. However, I now had a big draw to stay: Daniel had offered me a promotion. I guess Koro’s positive opinion of me and my composure during the custom was enough to make him believe I could really handle this, and the pay raise was way more than I’d make anywhere else. Obviously, I ended up deciding to stay, and not just for the sake of my bank account. I thought it would be good for me to step out of my comfort zone and not be afraid of being afraid anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a year at this job, one thing is for sure: I will never not be afraid.",

        "text": "I remember the day I met my wife like it was yesterday. We were both 16 and in high school. She was new to the school and I couldn't help but notice her. I was immediately drawn to her, and I knew I had to talk to her. We started dating and it was like we were meant to be together. We knew that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together.\nWe were high school sweethearts and our love only grew stronger as we got older. We went to college together and then got married when we were 22. We were happy, young and in love.\n\nOne day, I came home early from work and found her in bed with another man. I was devastated and couldn't believe what I was seeing. She tried to explain that she had been feeling suffocated and needed to experience life outside of our relationship. But I couldn't understand how she could cheat on me, the person she had promised to spend her life with.\n\nWe separated and she begged for me to take her back, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't trust her again and I couldn't forget what she had done.\n\nThat's when things started to get crazy. She started to spread rumors about me, saying that I had forced her into the relationship since we were 16 and that I would hit her if she asked to leave. She even went as far as to file a restraining order against me.\n\nI knew that none of it was true and I couldn't understand why she would say such terrible things about me. I was determined to clear my name and prove her accusations as false.\nAs the truth came out, it was revealed that she had been lying about everything. She had made it all up to try and hurt me and make me look bad.\n\nIn the end, it all became too much for her and she committed suicide &amp; wrote the note in her last efforts to strike me, in the note she had said that none of what she said was a lie and I had fooled eveyone. I was left feeling guilty and responsible for her death, even though I knew it was not my fault. I couldn't help but feel that I should have been able to save her, to help her through her troubles.\n\nIn the end, I was left with a broken heart and a shattered life. I had lost the woman I had loved since I was 16, my life is ruined from the publicity and people stalking my home throwing bricks through my window late at night saying I’m a murderer. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was always something off about her, and I couldn't believe that the girl I had grown up with could have turned into such a monster. I learned that love can turn into the most dangerous thing, and the person you thought you knew can become a stranger.",

        "text": "I looked over at the clock that was sitting on my desk, it flashed big red letters at me “11:28pm” they read. I figured I did enough work for one day and shut off my computer before rising from my desk and pulling a hoodie over my head as I left my bedroom. I walked to the living room to find my pug, Boomer sleeping on the couch. I gently woke him up and said to him “Hey bud. Want to go outside?” He was quick to stand up and make his way to the back door so I could take him outside to do his business before we went to sleep.\n\nI pulled on my boots and opened the door as me and Boomer stepped outside, causing the snow under us to crunch beneath our weight. Boomer almost immediately took off running when something caught his eye that I didn't notice. I began walking slowly across my backyard occasionally checking on the dog to make sure he wasn't up to no good.\n\nI saw a big fluffy snowflake fall from the sky slowly. My eyes followed it all the way to the ground when it landed near something I had never seen before. There were 4 long skinny lines in the snow. 1 single line and then at the end of the line there were 3 other lines that all were connected by the main line. They almost seemed like footprints of some kind, but they were too skinny and much too long to belong to a human. My mind began to wonder what type of animal this could have been. That's when I noticed that the prints seemed to go in the direction right behind me. I turned, half expecting to see a long lanky figure that came from the imagination of a scared 6 year old child, but to no surprise, nothing. They just led towards my neighbors fence. \n\nAs I stared I heard the running of my dog come towards me behind me. I turned just in time to see his big googly eyes, ears flying in the wind, and wide smile on his face as he panted from running around. I laughed as he crashed into my legs, causing me to stumble a little but I managed to get my balance back. I grabbed a small amount of snow and rolled it into a ball before playfully catching Boomers attention with it and then throwing it. He chased it and got confused when it hit the snow. I chuckled as he dug and sniffed at the landing sight. \n\nI turned back around to face the footprints and curiosity got the best of me. I followed them to my neighbors fence and scaled the tall wooden boards, perching myself so I could see the other side of the fence but I didn't go to their backyard. And what I saw where the tracks had led me, shocked me. Absolutely nothing. I looked back down to my backyard to confirm this is where the tracks led. It was like they walked into the fence and vanished.\n\nA particularly cold gust of wind came over me, upsetting my balance on the fence a little and sending a shiver down my spine. I climbed off the fence and said to my dog “Alright Boomie. Are you ready to go back inside?” He tilted his head to the side for a moment before making his way towards the door back into our house and I soon followed.\n\nI got ready for bed, and laid there tossing and turning, my mind racing with questions and thoughts on the prints. Eventually I just decided to start googling, of course to no avail. The closest thing I could find to the prints I saw were that of a bunny, but even those were nowhere near what I had seen just outside my walls.\n\nThe only way I could describe what I saw was if you took a clothes hanger from your closet and made 4 connected imprints. Very long, and absurdly skinny.\n\nMy bedroom is on the back of the house, in fact, the closest area of the house to where the tracks were. I leaned across my bed and opened the curtains. I looked down at the snow to look for the prints again. But, nothing. My gaze wandered over where I had seen them. I saw my footprints and Boomers footprints, but no animal footprints. I tore my eyes from the backyard, blaming the fact that the prints were gone on the dark lighting outside. I tried to calm my slightly undone nerves and laid down in my bed and lifted my big fluffy blankets over my shoulders. Even though my mind was still racing, I was able to doze off sooner or later.\n\nThe next night, me and Boomer did a ritual similar to the one we did the previous night. However, on this night, I went to check the footprints in the snow, but they were not there. Nor were they gone. My eyes went wide when I saw that the footprints were on the side of the house facing the wall. No other footprints, just two, right next to each other facing the house. It was the wall to my bedroom. It was also the same wall that had a window that looked directly into my bedroom. I looked around, scanning my surroundings, unnerved. \n\nMe and Boomer went back inside sooner rather than later. I knew sleeping tonight was going to be harder than normal, so I took a few minutes to search my house for a bottle of melatonin to help get the job done.\n\nI climbed into bed and plugged my phone into its charger. I opened my curtain and gave one last glance outside. I looked down and of course, I saw no footprints. I sighed and closed my curtain and curled up in my bed and tried to fall asleep.\n\nI'm not sure how long it took me to fall asleep, but I woke up a few hours later, probably between two and three o’clock. In my half asleep state I opened the curtains again, but saw nothing. It was too dark outside to see anything.\n\nI woke up again shortly after that. Right now as I'm writing this it is nearing 4:30 am. So why am I telling you all of this when I could be sleeping? This is why;\n\nI woke up at around 3:45 and opened my curtains yet again. I took a second to look outside and noticed how pretty the stars were. I looked at the light snowfall and all of the street lights in the distance. That's when it hit me, how did I not see any of this before?\n\nIt hadn't even hit me previously in my sleepy state, but when I first looked outside, I would have seen this but I didn't. It was completely and utterly black. As if someone covered my window in black paint. My mind wandered more and more and I had to assume that something was outside of my window. My tired and anxious mind made my body tremble at the thought that when I had looked out my window, was there something staring back at me?\n\nTo make matters even worse, my bedroom is on the second floor of the house.\n\nSo I guess the reason I'm telling you all this is to get an answer of some kind. My mind has traveled from nightmares, hallucinations, and every creepy pasta that I know of. None of which seem to give me any answers.\n\nI am asking for your advice. What do I do when my dog needs to go outside in the morning? Is it safe? Of course I can keep my dog inside and clean up after him, but I can't stay in my home forever. So please, I am open to any suggestions.\n\nIf I see any more of the footprints in the snow, I will make sure to update you here.",

        "text": "I'd like to say this first: We were in the same fraternity when we were going to college. He was quite a party animal back in the day. So much so that he earned the fraternity nickname Jamboree.\n\nI was on a special night out with my boyfriend Tanner (yes, I'm gay, don't judge me). We were at a ballroom party for the induction of a new local robotics program he and I initiated. Tanner and I were both engineering majors.\n\nThen, someone came along. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I knew I'd seen this guy before when I first noticed him.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Harlan. Do you remember me?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I don't know you.\"\n\n\"Do you remember? Back in \\[xxxxxx\\] University, Popcorn?\"\n\n\"How do you know my old fraternity nickname?\"\n\n\"I was *very* obese back then. You probably remember me like this.\"\n\nThen the guy did that thing where you inflate your cheeks. I had the sudden realization that--\n\n\"Oh, Jamboree! It's been a while! What a surprise to see you here!\"\n\nI did, of course, remember Jamboree being very fat. He'd lost a lot of weight since!\n\n\"Likewise, Popcorn. In fact, my industry is beginning and we're in need of your unique abilities.\"\n\n\"You want robotics and engineering in your industry. Are you some kind of cyberfreak now, Jamboree?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd gotten a job opportunity at an obscure, local, very new company called Hepburn Industries. It was started by Theodore \"Jamboree\" Hepburn about a year ago, and he said to me when I got a tour of the building that he'd just bought,\n\n\"I want to have robotics in the industry. I want robots, to help create my machines. I want your research into robotics.\"\n\nI hoped he was faking the creepiness of the tone of voice, but he seemed unsettling.\n\nI took the job with stride. Jamboree said he'd be willing to give me unlimited funding on my research and I'd have my own lab. I should have listened to Tanner when he said this sounded fishy.\n\n\"Harlan, please. I don't like this. How could a crazy party animal like Jamboree have a *robotics* company?!\"\n\nOf course, when I toured the building, the lab appeared like one in the movies. Then, Jamboree showed me to what he said would be my own \"lab.\"\n\nBig mistake. It didn't look one bit like a lab.\n\nThe walls appeared rotting. And the ceiling was somewhat leaky. The room appeared to have a bed that looked somewhat eaten. By rats, as I'd assume.\n\nI heard something that sounded like an intercom.\n\n*\"Popcorn, the lab equipment is in the closet. Bring it out, and work on your research.\"*\n\nJamboree's voice was on the other end of the intercom.\n\n*\"Work on the robotics...* ***forever!****\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter three days, I was sure Tanner was worried for me. When one of the employees of the company came in the room after one day, I had been handcuffed to the table where I had been forced to work on the machine parts.\n\nI wished I hadn't taken the job opportunity, let alone fallen for his trick. I hadn't even noticed myself in any mirrors. But after a while on the third day, I decided I was finally sick of the bullshit and I tried to escape.\n\nWhen I tried picking the locks on that set of handcuffs, though, some kind of alarm was going off.\n\nAnd then I heard this crazy message over the intercom.\n\n*\"Warning! This is an emergency! Subject 12 is escaping! Take the emergency measures now!\"*\n\nThen some group of who I assumed to be employees of Jamboree came in, looking like they were in hazmat suits. I was held down, and then knocked out.\n\nI woke up again, handcuffed to the table. But this time, my legs were manacled to the chair legs.\n\nThen, I decided to put some of my engineering skills to use and decided to try creating something to bypass the alarm system that was in these things, and then unlock myself and escape. I pretended to still be working on the projects Jamboree was trying to make me do.\n\nAnd then, as I did it again, with the bypass thing working, I freed myself from the restraints keeping me at the work bench.\n\nI looked around for camera systems. Sure enough, there was one camera that seemed to be pointed at me.\n\nI forged a pin under the guise of working further on the thing I was being forced to do. And then, I shot it at the camera like a spitball, disabling it.\n\nThen, I used the materials in the room to create makeshift tools for escape. It felt like my life mattered more than anything else. I opened the door, which appeared to have an alarm system built in. So I disabled it with my newly created bypass device, and got out the door.\n\nOne of the employees seemed to be standing guard. I knocked him out, and dragged him inside. Then I stole his clothes and stuffed his body in the \"closet,\" which was really a hidden compartment in one of the walls of the room.\n\nI then looked at the doors of the other rooms. Each room had been marked with a number.\n\nThe door of the room I got out of was marked with the number 12.\n\n(*Subject 12 is escaping!*)\n\nThe rooms, I realized, had different \"subjects\" under the thumb of Jamboree. One through 11 if you don't count the room I was in.\n\nSweating out of fear that I would blow my cover, I used the bypass device and makeshift lockpick to unlock the doors, one by one, without tripping the alarm system.\n\nWith more pins forged in my room in case of it, I shot them like spitballs at the cameras.\n\nI started with 11. Inside the room was a woman. She was around 15 from the looks of it.\n\n\"H-Hello?\"\n\n\"Get back, guy! Are you here to hold me down again for not performing?!\"\n\n\"Performing?\"\n\n\"You work for that Hepburn, don't you?!\"\n\n\"Hey!\" I whispered. \"I'm not with him.\"\n\n\"Your clothes say otherwise! It's been a week and I'm still being forced by guys like you to dance!\"\n\nI then showed her out of the room and then took her to my room.\n\n\"Y-You're the Subject 12?\"\n\n\"I made a mistake to take what I assumed to be a robotics industry job opportunity.\"\n\n\"So that's what you were lured into this place with?\"\n\n\"I'm wearing these as a disguise.\"\n\n\"Okay, good. Sorry for the identity mistake. I'm Rani.\"\n\n\"I'm Harlan.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Room 10, a man called Roberto, at around 30 years old. He'd been here for a month. He was lured into the room with a job offer to be a mechanic.\n\nIn Room 9, a woman called Alice, who was about 25 years old. She'd been here for a month and a half. She was told she'd get to study to be a doctor.\n\nIn Room 8, a woman called Terry, who was 19 years old. She'd been here for 3 months. She'd been fooled by Jamboree into thinking she'd get to achieve her dream of being a fortuneteller. She'd had a set of tarot cards on her.\n\nIn Room 7, a man called Norris. He was somewhat elderly. He'd been here 3 months, around the same time Terry was lured inside. He'd been lured into it by a ruse that he'd go into a quality rest home that would care for him unlike any other rest home.\n\nIn Room 6, a teenage girl called Beverly. She'd been here 4 months, lured into Hepburn Industries by being told she'd have her own art studio and would have complete control over the art she would make.\n\nIn Room 5, a little boy called Miguel. He'd been here 5 months. He'd been lured into thinking he'd be in a school with a very low chance of bullying.\n\nIn Room 4, a woman called Maureen. She is a college student, and she'd been here 5 months, lured into thinking she'd be living in a dorm where she could study without much of a chance of rape.\n\nIn Room 3, another teenage girl. She was called Kaley. She'd been here 5 months and was lured into this diabolical trap under the ruse that she'd be in foster care, away from her abusive parents.\n\nIn Room 2, an enby who had just graduated high school, called Ghost. Fae was here 6 months, lured by the ruse of applying for college. Fae was scared I was one of the employees, but I managed to calm faer down.\n\nAnd finally, in Room 1, I had freed with the bypass device and my lockpick the first person Jamboree had lured inside. It took a while, but when I remembered seeing this woman's face on a milk carton...\n\n\"Stop! Stop! Don't do it again! I'll cooperate, I swear!\"\n\n\"Don't worry!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, my left foot!\"\n\nIt took a while to calm her down and finally prove to her that we, the escaped \"subjects\" of this company, were really in disguise to fool the others.\n\nApparently, she'd been here for over a year. Before Jamboree had started his own company.\n\n\"So you're Yolanda? I've seen your face on missing posters and stuff.\"\n\n\"Wait, really?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll twelve of us decided to put together a plan to escape the building should any of us be exposed. I'd been the one to put together the devices used to help us escape, like the alarm bypassing device that helped us get out without tripping the system and the pins that destroyed the cameras.\n\nThat, and knocking out each of the employees to disguise ourselves. Maureen and Miguel had the idea to disguise themselves as one person, because Miguel was almost 7 and Maureen could carry a small child on her shoulders at her height and build.\n\nWe were trying to power through the fears, but we were mostly afraid of our covers being blown.\n\nEach of the doors had to be closed after getting out, so that we could make it look like the \"subjects\" were still locked inside.\n\nI'd explained to them that I'd known Jamboree before. He and I went to the same university those few years ago. He'd never been like this before this... stuff.\n\nAnd they believed me when I told them about him being a party animal.\n\n\"Hey, Harlan!\" Ghost interjected. \"How about we just leave the premises and then take off the disguises when we're out of sight?\"\n\n\"Not bad, but we need to be out of camera range first.\" I replied.\n\nWe were putting together an escape plan in what appeared to be a kind of break room. It was Roberto's idea to disguise it as having coffee while on break. Then, we were paralyzed with fear when something got said over the intercom.\n\n*\"Attention, all employees! All test subjects have escaped the experiment! Watch out for employees you do not recognize!\"*\n\nI began to feel scared. It was as if we were beginning to go to survival mode.\n\nThis was the time we decided to put our escape plan into motion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I pilfered some maps from one of the guards near the breakroom entrance, I figured out that we'd be going up stairs to get to some kind of ground floor. Two floors to go up. That seemed like it'd be easy, right?\n\nBut there were no ramps. Norris would have a hard time going up the stairs.\n\nBut this struck an idea. I decided that to go up the stairs, we would put together our minds to get us *all* up the stairs.\n\nUsing materials I could find within the area, I forged what appeared to be a dolly, and then created a kind of cot and box, to have Norris in.\n\nNorris was adamant that he use an elevator, but I had to tell him that the place had no elevators, by design.\n\nIn doing this thing, Norris wasn't happy about me having us carry him in the thing, but it was better than all of us losing too much strength by carrying his body. So he had to go along with it.\n\nAnd once we were up both flights of stairs, an alarm went off. Then an intercom message came up. Again.\n\n*\"Attention, all employees! All test subjects have reached the ground floor! Watch for a group carrying an old man up some stairs!\"*\n\n\"Fuck! I forgot to disable the stair cameras!\"\n\n\"Harlan, did you forget we have a small child with us?!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Beverly! Sorry!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'd gone to a breakroom on the ground floor. Apparently, the employees were gone from the floor.\n\nSo we'd then taken Norris out of the box and dolly, and then I took apart the dolly to create a weapon should we encounter any of the place's employees, let alone Jamboree.\n\nNorris was not happy, but then he calmed down knowing it was either that or leave him behind.\n\nThen, I recognized the front entrance.\n\n\"Okay, everyone!\" I shouted, making it look like I was commanding employees about the \"test subjects.\" \"Listen up! I noticed that they have reached the front entrance! Let's move it!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter getting out the front entrance, we hid between cars, that we assumed to belong to employees.\n\n\"Can any of you drive?\"\n\nApparently, Terry was the only one capable of driving besides me.\n\nI decided to use my skills again. Still afraid of getting caught, I sure enough found a spare key in a black van's secret compartment by a gas tank. The van was thankfully big enough to fit everybody.\n\nAnd because I knew they needed to escape, I decided on staying behind to fight off the rest of the employees so that they could go and then I'd catch up to them.\n\nI decided that if I caught up to them after escaping, I'd beep the horn three times.\n\nA whole horde of these soldiers, aka Hepburn Industries employees, was after us. I wasted no time in using some engine parts and leftover bits of metal from inside the place to create a makeshift gun. I either shot or knocked out each of them.\n\nThen, they all suddenly stopped.\n\nJamboree began coming out from behind each of them.\n\n\"Popcorn! C'mon, we can work this out!\"\n\nI jumped, and was about to run when I suddenly noticed something... strange.\n\n\"Popcorn! Thanks to you, my contract with the demon Colbran is null! I'll never make it to heaven now!\"\n\nHe shouted that as he fucking floated in the air!\n\n\"I was to exercise the skills of all that I could! So that I could put together a perfect being for Colbran! Now it's impossible! You nullified my contract, Popcorn!\"\n\nAnd I was paralyzed with fear as he floated toward me.\n\n\"I sold my soul to Colbran, who said that if I created the perfect being for him, I'd make it to Heaven! Now I'll never go! Damn you, Popcorn!\"\n\nI was terrified for my life by then, but I found my courage and shouted to him,\n\n*\"Two things, Jamboree! One, you are completely deranged, and two, I liked you better* ***fat***\\*!\"\\*\n\nI was about to run when he'd frozen in place with what looked like an astonished expression on his face.\n\nAs he was coming at me with his demonic appearance and powers and whatnot, he looked excited.\n\n\"I'm ready to binge! Gimme some cake! Roast me some marshmallows and give me s'more!\"\n\nI found a key in a secret compartment in a vehicle, and I was about to get in when a demonic tentacle grabbed my arm.\n\n\"You're all I need for the perfect being! Why must you go back to that damned Tanner?!\"\n\nThe tentacle came from Jamboree. This was enough to make adrenaline flow right to my brain and make me break the fuck out of his grip.\n\nAnd I unlocked the car and got inside. Turning the key, I started the engine, which I realized had half a tank of gas.\n\nNo matter. The half a tank could get me the fuck out of here ASAP.\n\nI was in the car, cowering as Jamboree, who was in fact no longer the Jamboree I once knew, was trying to break into the car. His face had contorted and become something incredibly creepy.\n\nAnd I backed out, not caring who or what was behind me anymore, though I'd looked in the rearview mirrors. I backed out of the parking lot quickly, and once I got out into the road, I saw Jamboree dissolving before my very eyes.\n\n\"NOOO!! I'M DONE FOR!! MY CONTRACT WITH COLBRAN IS NULLIFIED!! NOOOOOO!!!\"\n\nAnd his body soon became nothing more than a pile of ashes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, along with Tanner, we decided to meet every year to catch up on our lives since our escape 2 years ago. Norris died last month. Alice is now finishing up on medical school. Roberto is training to be a mechanic. Rani is now a budding street musician. Terry is making a living as a tarot reader. Beverly is now a painter and sculptor who makes money from commissions. Miguel is homeschooled now, in hopes that neither he nor his parents fall for a trap like it again. Maureen is now back in college. Kaley is now living with Terry, since her parents are now in prison for theft. Ghost is now going to college, and fae has great grades so far. Yolanda is now living with her family again, after so long. I never knew she was a mom until last year.\n\nI am writing this on the new smartphone I had just bought. I'm making money from the program me and Tanner, who are engaged now, started. We're currently working on moving a robotic arm!\n\nLet us hope we never experience that thing again. I'll never forget how scared I was from seeing Jamboree as a demon...",

        "text": "What is it about liminal spaces that transfix the mind? Isolation, familiarity, dark halls and corners, the tension of being somewhere forbidden. Stripped from their original, intended purposes in the absence of human life, these places become hollow; unmasked and forgotten. Their memories and history, lost or never made. Meaningless places stuck between points A and B. And to make them a destination is to enter a still reality not meant to be seen. \n\nI saw them everywhere. The cracked parking lot of a laundromat, the still lobby of a hotel, the cramped interior of a car, the dusty cabinets of a distant relative’s house, untouched and ignored. Their commonality made life feel empty and glum. Life itself had become liminal: one long stretch between nonexistence.\n\nSo, the concept of the Backrooms and their haunting possibilities, naturally, filled me with excitement. A fictional universe of near infinite liminal locations: a blank canvas of pointless lands anyone could write life into. A cure for liminality. Twisted entities, mysterious items, reactive characters, warring factions, and thousands of levels for them to explore with limitless stories to be told. It was a collaborative plunge into the quietest, simplest fears our imaginations could offer. \n\nBut, as I tripped and fell through the sidewalk and landed somewhere cold and unknown, the Backrooms had become more than just a story. The sun was replaced by a bare light bulb. Its string dangled beside me, the end almost sweeping the floor. Shadows crept close. In the new dim night, a fear of the unexpected emerged from the claustrophobic walls of darkness which concealed my surroundings. \n\nHeavy breathing, shaky fingers, and the pain of my falling entry were all I had at that moment. Having fallen so low, I’d joined the ranks of dust and century old stains on the hardwood floor. It was there, on the ground, I saw a subtle emerald light blinking from behind a doorless frame nearby. The floors groaned under my heavy footsteps as I followed the beacon like a mindless bug.\n\nI was faced with a breaker box mounted at eye level upon entering a closet-sized room. It was rhythmically washed in green by a flat cone lamp hanging from a high ceiling. Steel wire tubing extended out of the box like slithering legs and ran along every surface of the room in clusters. A single tripped breaker sat within the oversized box. I flipped it with a satisfying snap and brought the place to life. The green lamp stopped responding, but a brighter yellow-white light awakened from behind. \n\nI returned to what might’ve once been a living room. The amber wood beneath my feet laid in tattered despair. Their corners curved upward while entire planks bowed in full. The floor was a turbulent ocean stuck in time. The walls were no better. Where its surface coat of fermented white paint had flaked away, a sickly green showed. Another doorless frame stood on the same wall as the closet. There were no windows to offer an escape or a fresh view to break up the malignant decay. The naked light bulb and its long string rested at the center of a dizzyingly high-set popcorn ceiling. The room was a senile memory of itself. I felt rejected, caught somewhere hostile and forbidden like being in the depths of a bear den.\n\n“No,” I muttered, retreating through the other doorway in search of an exit. A copy of the same empty living room welcomed me on the other side. It was identical down to the dust bunny. I stood in the frame, stuck in a mirror. \n\n“Am I in Limbo?” I muttered. The simple question made my knees buckle and I slumped against the wall. Pranks couldn’t be so elaborate, dreams never felt so real. I wanted to go home. But, what if I couldn’t leave? Who else would feed my cat or do my job or wash the dishes? Nobody knew of my whereabouts or the existence of this place. I would die alone in mystery and obscurity. Who would even believe such a story if I returned home? My family would laugh at the idea that I slipped into the sidewalk and came out the other end. But, the truth often sounds like fantasy.\n\n“No,” I repeated. “I couldn’t have. Impossible. It’s a silly internet story.” But, if it were only fiction, how could the silence be so potent? My weak murmurs were consumed by the still air. I felt foolish and crazy. Yet, I stood up straight and steeled my knees. Escape would only come if I found it myself. \n\nI entered a third copy room. Then a fourth. And further it repeated until every square inch of the wretched place was seared into my mind. It began to overlay on the memories of my old living room. I imagined its furniture and feline occupying the shameful pretender. The fantasy felt real enough to be history. The difference was beginning to blur. \n\nThe cycle continued. Step through the doorway, avoid the same holes and rusted nails in the floorboards. Notice new consistent details and move on. At first, the fear of encountering something terrible haunted my mind. It made my stomach flutter and want to run away like a captive animal. Something had to greet me eventually. A hunched figure facing the corner, a bug hovering by the light bulb, a friend bursting out laughing from behind. The only signs of life were my own and the acceptance of isolation was slow, but true. \n\nSuddenly, I fell. Not just to my feet, but a meter down. There weren’t any splinters to pick out of my hands to my surprise. Rather, the flayed wooden floor was now the ceiling. The room was upside down. It wasn’t as though gravity had reversed. I could see through the doorway, the room before was still upright and proper. This new room was simply designed to be upside down. \n\nBut if gravity hadn’t changed, then why did the light bulb string defy it? It pointed upward, still toward the hardwood as though locked into position. I tapped it. It waved from side to side like a strand of excited seaweed, refusing to fall limp and obey my gravity. Tugging it down to my ankles made it bounce and swing in greater arcs. I couldn’t make it make sense, so there it remained. \n\nIn the following room, the string was dead and spread around the bulb. Its connection was severed from the light, plucked from its source. I continued onward without a word, satisfied, but unnerved. Something knew I was there; what I was doing and thinking just moments before. Was it trying to please or play?\n\nMy thoughts and questions grew repetitive without answers. The rooms immediately returned to redundancy. Walking was less stimulating than staring at a blank piece of paper. The inverse orientation offered little else to explore. Boredom tried to take my mind back home, but holes were expanding through my memories. It began to feel like my life was never lived. Over twenty years of history were melting into gray mud. What remained were approximate objects and faces, nostalgic houses, voices, smooth shedding cat hair; silhouettes of ideas lost in a thick fog. Was it worth returning to? A life growing less familiar with every step.  \n\nI was walking in a scattered daze when a new hallway began. The sight was hardly exciting. The walls and floor were the same. It stretched into sightlessness, both forward and behind, as though the repeat rooms had never existed outside of a false memory. Flat conical lamps extended from both walls, alternating sides so they never faced each other. Short stretches of darkness separated their illuminated islands. Strips of white paint would peel as I passed, falling to the ground behind my striding feet. Identical branching halls hid in the absolute black between lamps. They never took me anywhere new. \n\nI walked the insanity for what felt like hours before an eventual end began to dawn on the narrow horizon. It wasn’t a wall that blocked my path. It was the total end of light which halted my soul at the edge of sure footing. Each step forward would be a gamble with the unknown. The odds against me were unlimited. \n\nBut, I wasn’t going to turn back. Where else was there left to go? Maybe this was the exit I was wandering for. The thought didn’t stop me from hesitating with the first step. The tip of my scanning shoe tapped a flat surface. The floor hadn’t ended with the light. The walls hadn’t either. Matter lived on in the dark. Several meters in and my toes kicked a wall hidden before my eyes. There was new light far above. Like a chimney, the hall bent upward at ninety-degrees and continued farther than I could see. My curious fingers stuck to the inky invisible wall. Not from an adhesive, but from an unreal attraction. It held me tightly like a strong magnet. \n\n“Of course,” I mumbled to myself. It seemed obvious in its absurdity. Without thinking, I climbed the wall like a spider, quickly and without resistance. And before long, I was crawling on a new ground, infantile and amazed. My lips curled into a smile for the first time since arrival. \n\nBut, the inevitable return to mundanity made it fall. Not into the frown I’d worn until that point, but into neutrality instead. Getting lost had become routine; wandering in body and mind. It was comfortable and thoughtless like drinking water. I felt myself walking more confidently into empty shadows. Lively footsteps echoed alone. \n\nPassing each hall gambled my time and energy for an elusive exit or anomaly. The addiction kept me going as hunger or despair began to sprout. It was an odd form of entertainment, but the only one I had. And though I eventually won the odds of finding something new. It was a grim discovery. \n\nSomething terrible hid outside the bounds of those dark halls: a greater, ghastly place which surrounded the walls like a thick layer of insulation. It was the winter that killed my hope of escape. Strong buzzing emitted from a gaping hole in the ceiling line. A pile of paint and drywall laid beneath. Old wet carpet, maddening mono-yellow, and loud fluorescent bulbs. The true Backrooms were peering down at me through a break in its own creation. My vision strained from the powerful light and stomach cramped from the must and mildew. It had been watching all along, guiding me through its halls. I was a germ in its veins, and the force of the realization was an avalanche on my chest. \n\nIts presence was nauseating, so I ran. My legs moved on their own while my eyes scanned every inch of the passing halls. An upward staircase was at the far end of a hallway to my left. I wasn’t foolish enough to take the convenient escape. But, the next branching hall led to the same stairs. All the halls did. It was coming up before me. I looked behind and found it followed. An upward wooden staircase waited patiently only a meter away. I didn’t have a choice, this place wouldn’t give me one. I fell to my knees like a stubborn child in the advent of a tantrum. It couldn’t make me climb the stairs if I didn’t want to. \n\nAnd so the ground opened up instead. The jagged floorboards separated like teeth and ate me alive. I slid down a cold smooth surface in pitch black for a brief moment. I was spat into the corner platform of a staircase. The same wood floors, the same peeling white paint. A new prison, but it was all the same. I screamed and smacked the walls in pure madness. Curses flew from my lips. They were pointed in every direction. At myself, at the Backrooms, at conscious life itself. \n\nAs I panted in breathless fury, forehead pressed against the wall, I noticed something new. The green paint had become porous. Holes of various sizes had opened up to a starry abyss. Some were large enough to fit my fingers while others barely let the pinprick stars shine through. It was empty beyond the threshold. Only open space and the promise of far off light; of other planets and people, or many more miles of identical empty corridors. Perhaps it was only fluorescent light peeking through dots in a black background. \n\nThe descending stairs turned and disappeared behind a right-angle corner. They led into a darkness I had no intention of exploring. The few ascending steps led to an abrupt wall with a window at its center. An opaque, white plastic film hid the glass. The camouflaged white frame peeked out from underneath. Above the window hung a lamp from a short, thin chain. Two exposed Edison bulbs offered a weak glow. I imagined the hideous original Backrooms sealed behind the plastic by a previous wanderer. But, I wanted to see if it were true. My thumb sank deep into the window cover as I tried to tear through. The plastic stretched inward until my entire forearm was immersed, but it never tore. \n\nWith so few options, I chose to retire to the pocket of stairs and shallow light. My old life was dead. It died along with the memories of my house and of the faceless people and furniture that lived within. If they could find purpose without my presence, then I could find mine in the stairs. A faint ray of sun, the sliver of a reason to live.\n\nIt was a short and peaceful time. When hungry, I’d eat my hair and skin and paint chips. Stretching the window plastic like putty subdued my shaking rage and mired depression. Dreaming of the starry depths offered a temporary escape. Sleep was a lush, lonely valley of stone, vines, and metal pipes. There I could stretch my legs and wander. Wild food was abundant. The cool wind carried soothing bird-songs. It’s where I spent most of my time and so it became more of a home than the stairs itself. \n\nWhy couldn’t I have no clipped into my inner empire instead? Because the Backrooms wanted to take everything from me. To leave me stripped and mad and dependent on its walls. It found satisfaction in it. My life, my choices, time, mind, and future all fell into its control. Standing amongst the sky, the last I saw of the valley was a misty pond far below. I jumped from a cliff, soared, then sank into the frigid pool and awoke in a bed of mud. \n\nThe stairs were dripping, oozing into each other like molten stone. I held my mushy ground until the stairwell had decayed into a slide. Clawing and kicking at the walls for leverage only hastened my new home's demise. Heat radiated from my face in the embarrassment of failed defiance. The descent scrambled my head, orientation was lost in the spinning and tumbling. All I could do was shield myself and pray for the chaos to end. Every sharp turn down the stairwell threw me into a wall, which shook and weakened upon impact. They were collapsing under the weight of the rushing wood slurry.  \n\nA wall crumbled before me and led to a splat; stillness on stable ground. Liquid followed in heavy flow. It covered me like a runny blanket. Aching with pain, I laid face down waiting for my conscience to catch up. Tears and snot mixed into the sludge. Fists beat and splashed. I felt like a fool. What was there left to take? My home, routines and relationships, memories, patience and cleanliness, cell and sanity: gone. I had to reevaluate. Messy mind, fading life, the damp rags that hugged clammy skin, the old phone in my right pocket, and leather wallet in the left. The Backrooms were winning. Rolling over, I extracted my ID from the wallet and gazed at the picture. A stranger returned the stare. I tossed the useless card and stood up. My hands shook. They wanted to rob the robber.\n\nThe room was simple. It had no exits or decor. Only the same barren walls and dead floor. It was filled with harsh light, but the ceiling was absent any sources. The holes in the walls were growing like excited mold colonies. Cracks ran between them like widening rivers. The backdrop of stars steadily grew as flecks of white and green paint fell and fluttered through the room like snow and summer leaves. \n\nThe old amber wood floor was rending. I centered myself on the largest remaining platform. I stuffed any wood chips or bits of the wall that floated close enough to snatch into my pockets. Once they were brimming, I filled my mouth, chewed, and swallowed. The sharp pieces were soaked in blood from my gums. We were unified, the rooms and I. And I was needed if they wanted to become whole again. Victory felt freeing like a loosened collar.\n\nThe ceiling and walls were gone. Their remains drifted into the expanses of space and joined with the starlight. My heart thumped as the floorboards under my feet followed. I scrambled for them. They crumbled to dust and sifted through my fingers like the draining sands of time. Weightlessness filled my queasy stomach and a final gasp filled my lungs. Forty desperate seconds passed in the emptiness of space. Another breath came.\n\nThe void is comforting. Air is abundant. My blood hasn’t boiled, my skin hasn’t frozen over. The radiant heat of far fiery plasma warms the bones. I spend a great deal of time in thought, furiously typing with fading phone battery the story before your eyes. Beads of sweat separate from my forehead and float into view. More dots to the star field. \n\nThe glittering light encases me in every direction like a bubble. Painted throughout, the cradles of stars, vast nebulae of layered gas in every shade and shape, brew like stormy waters. The scene never sleeps. All the activities, so grand and irrespective of my presence, demand awe and respect. This place is no vacuum or prison; there are no materials to hold me down. A boundless domain of lawful solitude: a true home. \n\nBut space is disorienting. How long have I been drifting and in which direction? Time may take every destination before I arrive. The stars do cannibal dance. They fuse into fewer and larger bodies. A splash of light explodes from every impact and what fragments remain collide in chains of parsec lightning. A celestial fireworks display of dying creation. My eyes sear from the overload, but to close them would be a disservice. I desperately try to describe the universal performance with the excitement of being its audience. \n\nThe nebulae and survivor stars mix into solid waves of blue, pink, and purple light. They crash and settle into a great shimmering ring of aurora at the farthest edges of space. And with impossible speed, the trillions of lightyears worth of photons condense into a meter diameter around my puny planet waist. Its light, only a cell of its true brightness, now fainter than the old Edison bulbs of the Backrooms. Time is on its deathbed and to be its only companion is a terrifying honor. Eternal night cuts its unity. It shatters into scraps of desperate glow like the last embers of a cold ashen fire. It’s their final act, a weak encore. The splendor fizzles into emptiness. The end of the universe, over in an hour.\n\nThe abyss is claustrophobic and motionless. I ponder while drifting like a fish in a midnight trench. Why was I brought here? To be rewarded with torment and the weight of universal annihilation? And where is here? Yet another room within the Backrooms; the container of infinity? Every answer is only a theory. All I know is that existence doesn’t end in darkness. My thoughts still come from somewhere and whistles echo into eternity. Perhaps there’s a floor I’m slowly falling towards where a green lamp flickers nearby. Or, maybe long beyond space and time, I’ll find Earth again, waiting in the dark end. A lifeless planet for an ant.\n\nMy phone’s soft blue glow is a dreadful hope. Every tap siphons a final percentage of life. As the little star fades and my mind finally fails, a faint signal of anomalous service will carry my words to reaches unknown. They will bring the death of everything into the afterlife of your eyes, not to be forgotten and for nothing. And until then, the remnants of home will remain in my memory, here in the nowhere, as well.",

        "text": "I’ve been a cop for almost three years now. Everyday my alarm chimes at exactly 1000hrs, I head to the gym, shower, prep my meals for the day, and head to the station to work the evening shift. If it’s the weekend, I may hit the bars after work with my shift but otherwise this job is my life- for better or worse.\n\nThey warned us in the academy that the job can change you and that you’ll lose most of your family and friends. Sometimes the loss is from a difference in political views, sometimes it’s from lack of free time, and sometimes from our short-tempered bursts due to extreme burn out. But whatever the reason may be, those people aren’t easily replaced. The job consumes your entire being and prevents you from meeting new people (who aren’t other cops). \n\nWouldn’t you know, it didn’t even take three years before my instructor’s words rang true. Well, besides for Ethan. Ethan and I have been best friends since first grade and even my odd sleep schedule, extreme exhaustion, and lack of ability to schedule just about any plans, he never wavered. \n\nI was a quiet kid, but Ethan wasn’t. He always saved me a seat on the bus and even though I didn’t know the kid, I was always excited to have someone to sit with. As time went on, he made more of an effort and I opened up from my shell. One day in high school during lunch I remember asking him why he always saved me a seat, expecting him to tell me how he wanted to be friends or liked my lunch box, or some other shit. \n\nEthan lifted his sandwich from the iconic red tray and took a bite of his sandwich before telling me, “The kid the stop after you smelled like straight fish sticks and I needed to make sure he didn’t sit with me.”\n\nThat’s Ethan for ya. He wasn’t popular by any means, but he never lacked confidence or integrity. He quickly became my most trusted person. At least, he was.\n\nWe’ve talked every single day for the past 10 years. If it isn’t texting, we’re constantly sending each other Snapchats or links to videos. He’s like a brother to me. Hell, he just asked me two weeks ago to be the best man at his wedding. I was stoked about it, and not just because I wanted to plan a trip to Vegas or Nashville- but because I really like his fiancé. I’ve known her since college and she’s just the chillest girl ever. They recently bought a house together, a small cottage-style yellow house that I grew up calling the “Matilda House.” There were always rows of brightly colored flowers and a small white picket fence that was just high short enough to allow you to see the flowers and front stoop. I was actually excited when they bought it so I could finally see the inside to compare if it was anything like I had engrained in my head like the movie. But now, I pray that I never have to step foot in that house again.\n\nIt was around 2200 hrs, nearing the end of my shift. It had been an eerily quiet night. I was just finishing my last sip of gas station coffee when the call went out and the disruption to the silence was such a startle, I spit some of my coffee out and it dribbled down to my radio mic. As I went to reach for a napkin, deja vus struck. \n\nMaybe I’m just sloppy and use a lot of napkins, but it was so strong I even KNEW the Dispatcher was about to send me priority. So much so, that before she finished calling out my badge, my finger was on the switch.\n\n“Dispatch to 822,” she called out.\n\n“822, go ahead,” I responded, finger still hovering.\n\n“Head to 344 XX(redacted) Lane for a 911 hang up. Dispatch heard loud screaming prior to the hang up. Priority authorized.”\n\nIt’s not often we get priority authorized in this small town, so I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little pumped to flick on my lights and hear the siren flood the empty the streets as I made my way toward the call. It took me about four seconds before the shock of adrenaline waned enough to recognize the address- it was Ethan’s house. \n\nI arrived on scene and the front door was slightly ajar. In any other house, my hand would have been on my gun, if not pulled out and down to my side. But this was my best friend, family. Within an instant, all police protocol leaped from my brain and was replaced with concern. I pushed open the door and yelled, “Ethan? Lauren?”\n\nNo response.\n\nI turned the corner and looked up the stairs. Blood was smeared all over the walls, wrapping around the furthermost side and into the kitchen. There was a pool of blood lying on the kitchen floor. The top of my boot splashed in the blood before I could stumble backward. \n\n“Jesus Christ,” I muttered. I followed the red trail up the stairs to their bedroom. \n\n&lt;I&gt;There was no way someone lost this much blood and was still alive.&lt;/I&gt;\n\nAs soon as the thought escaped my mind, I drew my weapon. I forced the bedroom door open with my boot, leaving a small new stamp of blood on the crisp white door that was already spattered with droplets. Ethan was curled in the corner of the room, grasping onto a knife. He was wide-eyed and jaw clattering. He was unrecognizable.\n\n“Ethan, what the fuck…” as I went to offer him help, my police senses caught up with my civilian emotions. He was covered in blood. And not just him, but the knife too.\n\n“822? Do you copy?”\n\nI physically shook my head to try to get my shit together. I held my gun in one hand, lowered. “822, negative, what?” I asked Dispatch.\n\n“822, 934 is entering the premise. Where do you want him?”\n\nMy Sergeant was on scene. “Upstairs, first door on the left. One,” I hesitated. Do I call him a suspect? A victim? “One individual with a knife. Stand down.”\n\nI release my mic and look at Ethan. “Ethan, man, you gotta drop the knife.”\n\nHe took a deep breath. Held it.\n\nI repeated, “Drop the knife.”\n\nHe released the knife and his lungs simultaneously  and let out a sob that still shakes me to even think about.\n\nAs I grabbed the knife, my Sergeant approached behind me. Then I realized…. And asked, “Ethan, where’s Lauren?”\n\nThe rest is a blur in my mind. As soon as my Sergeant arrived, I forced my mind and my body to enter Cop Mode, as I call it. Similar to Auto Pilot, it’s a nearly robotic function we use to hinder our personal emotions so that we can physically complete the task at hand without letting our emotions completely cripple us, to a point of danger. People may complain that cops are emotionless, but do you want someone shaking and crying when they run in to your house to save you from a gun wielding robber? Or someone vomiting and crying as you relive your rape in detail?\n\nI remembered every detail long enough to log it into my police report, but now, the adrenaline dump has set in. If you asked me what I wanted to eat, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I am incapable of the simplest most decision making abilities following removing my 40 lbs of gear. \n\nI will tell you this, Ethan admitted to stabbing Lauren. He said she was gone and that this wasn’t the first time. I was the one to place the handcuffs on him, and I’ll never get that image out of my head.\n\nI’m sad that I just lost my best friend. I’m sad that I lost his fiancé, an incredibly close friend of mine. I hate myself for not having seen the signs. I’m disgusted by caring so deeply about this guy who I considered family, could be so horrible. And I’m Angry. So ducking angry at Ethan.\n\nI lied there, trying to quiet the anxiety storm that was torpedoing my mind out of a sleepless state. I wanted to forget everything. I took a few deep breaths. \n\nBut then, I remembered something. The instant the storm in my mind even remotely paused, I could remember. Ethan whispered something to me as I walked over to grab the knife he dropped.\n\n“Hollowell. You were right.”\n\nHollowell… it’s familiar but I can’t place it. I close my eyes. &lt;I&gt; Hollowell, Hollowell…&lt;\\i&gt;\n\nMy eyes jolt open. Our 8th grade English teacher. But why? What did that mean?\n\nIt felt like I was never going to get to sleep, but at some point I eventually simply shut down. No other way to put it.\n\nI woke up today and couldn’t shake the last thought I had- Hollowell’s class. I knew my mom incessantly kept all of my schoolwork, labeled with the label maker she asked for on Mother’s Day how many years ago. I drove over to her house and dug out my 8th grade tote. \n\nI flipped through some book reports from Summer reading assignments- nothing Ethan had ever set his eyes on. I found a few tests, Romeo and Juliet, grammar, creative writing. I failed the Romeo and Juliet test- definitely nothing I was right about there. Grammar doesn’t seem very… murdery.\n\nBut there it was. My creative writing assignment I presented to the class. The only thing I ever got an A on. It was inspired by a compilation of late-night Harry Truman Show rewatching and Twilight Zone binging. I basically wrote an entire essay on how our lives are predetermined and out of our control, but not for a greater being, but rather due to the need to keep an equilibrium of parallel planes/universes. It was titled: It’s All a Set Up.\n\nAnd there it was, three paragraphs from  the conclusion:\n\n&lt;I&gt; Unexplained phenomena such as UFOs, Moms magically lifting cars, or even perfectly sane people committing murder, are a result of this life as we know it counteracting a glitch in the parallel. It’s when deja vu hits the hardest. &lt;/I&gt;",

        "text": "\n\n\nI left work Wednesday to go home  and I was almost positive someone is following me. I would hear footsteps maybe twenty feet behind me but whenever I looked no one was there. I got nervous after about three blocks of this so I hurried home and tried to forget about it. That night I took the trash out and heard them a little closer this time, not close enough to make a distance call just slightly louder. I convinced myself maybe something was wrong with me and to make an appointment with my psychiatrist and went to bed. \n\n Thursday, I called my psychiatrist and the earliest they could get me in wouldn’t be until late next week. I set a time and then left for work, the steps still sounded closer. I have an irrational fear of break ins or abductions so I was starting to become really alarmed. One day was a coincidence, two in a row was not. I decided to run to work this time and the footsteps followed, their distance always staying the exact same but every-time I looked nothing was there. I left work and it was the same thing, run, rush inside, lock the door. \n\nThat night I refused to leave the house and went to bed early and that’s when I saw it. A shadow just briefly out of the corner of my eye, maybe 6’0 tall. I quickly turned to look at it but it was gone as soon as I moved my head. I decided I was tired and went to bed early and then I saw it in my dream. This time it was different, the door to the hallway was open from my bedroom and I saw the shadow standing there, unmoving at the end of the hallway. I woke up to find my door closed and everything locked how I left it. \n\n Friday, it was Veterans Day so I stayed home and decided to just not leave the house. That was until I noticed there  were no groceries and I couldn’t starve. I decided to go to the corner store and get some bread and other bare essentials to make it through the weekend, I wanted to leave the house as little as possible. I didn’t want to know what happened when the foot steps finally reached me. As soon as I left the house the steps had grown exponentially closer, fifteen feet away now. I grabbed what I needed and hurried home. I told myself I wouldn’t leave the house anymore. \n\nThat weekend I continued to see the shadowy figure out of the corner of my eye, halfway across the room now…it’s closer, it’s closing in on me. In my dreams it was halfway down the hallway, no face, no features just a shadow. Could it even watch me without eyes? I don’t wanna know. \n\nMonday I called my psychiatrist first thing and explained it was an emergency. They told me to go to the hospital or call 911. No good, I can’t leave the house anymore. I thought surely it’s in my imagination? There is no shadow figure, I must have a  psychological disorder. Maybe a medication I need to start taking or some test to see what it is.  I called out of work for a few days then, I couldn’t leave the house. My boss said I could have one more day as that’s the last of my PTO. I took it, anything to avoid leaving and hearing those steps. \n\nWednesday comes and well I dreaded leaving the house, but I had to pay my bills. As soon as I stepped out of the door I heard it. Ten feet away, the steps are ten feet away. At this point I had given up trying to look, it was always the same nothing. I only saw the shadows at home so I could at least focus on my work to forget about this during the day. When I left work I heard them…five feet. They only get closer once a day never twice. I would’ve ran home but what’s the point, they never get any closer. \n\nThat evening the shadow figure I would see could’ve basically been sitting on the couch with me. I decided that was it, my appointment was tomorrow and there had to be something mentally unwell with me. We would figure it out then. In my dreams that night the shadow figure was in my bedroom, unmoving, watching or not watching I didn’t care at this point. It wasn’t REAL. That’s what I told myself at the time at least. \n\nThursday at 9:00AM was my appointment, I stepped outside and the footsteps were about a foot away now, I ignored them and went to my appointment. The doctor seemed to think I was having some form of manifestation of my fears but wanted to test me for a list of disorders to be sure. They all came out fine and he told me he wanted to start seeing me weekly until this resolved. I didn’t think I had a week now, I was right. \n\nI left the office and now the steps could’ve basically been stepping on my heels. I went home and was so tired so I took a nap. This time the dream was different. The shadow was next to my bed so nothing new, except it moved. It touched my arm and when I woke up I found scratched all along it. Almost like a rodent had been trying to crawl up. I decided I wouldn’t sleep or move anymore, I couldn’t take it. \n\nThat was three days ago, I haven’t moved since. I know I have to, I don’t have a choice so I’ve decided to take one last walk. I keep seeing the shadow figure just out of the corner of my eye, standing right next to me. This post is a warning to anyone who might ever experience this. You have 9 days, 12 days if you decide to sit like me. There is no way out, there is no escape. I just hope I get to smell some flowers on my last walk.",

Thanks for sticking around this long. Honestly, I thought I would disappear before I could write the second part of my story, so being able to write a third feels surreal. I’ve never been more grateful to be stuck in a barn. Writing is still a lot of work **(Dennis’ Note: Try adding my priceless commentary)**. But the last week has been so confusing that I wanted to get my thoughts down. I hope you’ll be able to make more sense of it than I could.\n\nI had gotten back to Dennis’ house well after midnight after being shoved from Alex’s body, so once I’d explained what happened he put Gabbie’s phone on the charger and went to bed. The phone turned on with a blinding flash a few minutes later, but the old ghost hunter was already snoring. The lock screen appeared, and while I didn’t know the password, I decided to hazard a few guesses. Unfortunately my fingers couldn’t generate enough heat to press the buttons, so I left Dennis to sleep and decided to check on my experiment. \n\nAfter I posted the first part of my story, I started working on a way to fight fire with fire. Dennis had used nothing but weeds and managed to concoct a way to prevent ghosts from touching his equipment. I wanted to do the same. I’d tried using clover, oak bark, and rose petals so far, but none of them had done anything perceptible. I had been hopeful when I'd spotted a few sprigs of dill among the tangle of plants in Dennis’ overgrown garden, and decided to mix it with violets in this latest attempt. The resulting mixture looked unimpressive at best. I looked skeptically over at one of Dennis’ experiments: a line of old soda bottles that hummed in the presence of paranormal energy. I had rinsed off the gel easily with water, but the effects still lingered. I kept my hand at the shortest distance possible and sprinkled some of the crushed up mixture onto the bottles, hoping the growing noise wouldn’t wake Dennis.\n\nBut moments later, the humming stopped. \n\nI pumped my fist in the air, accidentally knocking over one of the bottles and sending it crashing to the floor. I considered sprinkling the mixture on everything in the basement, but stopped myself. I wanted to keep this advantage secret from Dennis for now. I attempted to hide the pieces as best as I could, then went back upstairs. When I did, however, I heard Dennis already talking on the phone.\n\n“I’m on my way, ma’am, don’t you worry.”\n\nI decided to keep quiet until I had distanced myself from the basement door. “Where are you going?”\n\n“Sun Valley Farms,” Dennis grunted. “The owner’s wife told me they were under attack from monsters and need help. Would’ve called it hog-shit not a week ago, but we know better now.”\n\nI frowned. “No way in hell you’re going. I’m invisible. It would be safer if I went alone. I don’t trust those farmers.” Dennis paused, his expression uncharacteristically concerned.\n\n “You sure you can go back there alone?”\n\nI wasn’t sure. It was still hard to think about what had happened to my friends and I a few months ago, let alone the bile that rose to my throat when I considered that I had lingered in my friend’s rotting corpse for days. But even though I was scared of the monsters prowling the farm, I wasn’t going to let Dennis be sacrificed there too. “It makes the most sense, old man. You know it does.”\n\nDennis scratched his head, his finger tracing over age spots showing between thinning hair. He glanced regretfully out the window where a badly painted over cop car sat in the driveway, as if he had been looking forward to getting back in on the action. Then his fingers began to shake, and he sighed.“Fine. But if you are keeping out of sight, leave that yahoo friend of yours out of it.” I agreed, not wanting to risk Travis’ safety again anyway, and departed alone shortly afterwards. \n\nThe path to Sun Valley Farms felt oddly familiar now that I had done it multiple times. As I reached the property line I took a deep breath and scanned the landscape. The corn, still unharvested, had started to wilt in the recent morning frosts, but there was no sign of hellhounds or zombies. I decided to search the northern edge of the farm first and save the farmhouse for last, since I would have the highest chance of being discovered inside. As I quickly pushed through the areas Travis and I had searched previously, my attention grew so focused on the land ahead that I didn’t notice the stillness that hung in the air. Silence had accompanied me so much since I’d become a ghost that I’d grown accustomed to it. As I drifted haphazardly out of the corn, I froze with shock as I realized why I hadn’t been noticed.\n\nAll of the corpses were forming a barrier outside the front door of the farmhouse. \n\nMy heart caught in my throat so quickly that I didn’t scream, although the heaving gasps that followed as I attempted to calm down were just as loud **(Dennis Note: You still couldn’t be heard, nitwit)**. The corpses remained focused on the house even as I trampled through crisp, dying grass and shriveled leaves less than three feet behind them, their bodies rigid as if rigor mortis had finally set in. Bewildered, I kept my distance as I skirted the farmhouse and began searching the northern edge of the field. \n\nThis part of the field was the easiest  to traverse; most of it had been cut before my class had ever come here, making it easier to see things on the ground. However, most of the students had run in the opposite direction, so I didn’t anticipate finding anymore of their corpses. That made me feel less on edge, though I found myself wishing I could find something else that would help remind me of my friends. As I surveyed the ground hopefully, a bright splotch of neon yellow caught my attention. Thinking it was just another piece of trash, I passed over it in search of more interesting clues. However, a sense of recognition nagged at my brain until I was coerced into checking it out. \n\nThe scrap that had caught my attention turned out to be one of many. More than a dozen scraps of grubby yellow fabric were scattered on the ground, some of them pressed into tire tracks, others caught on the sharp edges of cornstalks. I picked up the most in-tact piece and realized why I recognized it. \n\nI had the exact same shirt.\n\nIn bold cursive writing, I could make out the word *Romeo*. The gaudy color couldn’t be mistaken for anything other than the shirt my school had given out to the members of last year’s play. I frowned, wondering how the shirt could have recently been shredded by a harvester. I pressed the piece of fabric into my pocket, deciding to put it out of my mind for the time being, then continued the search. Not far from the sun colored confetti I noticed a weathered wooden door on the ground just outside the field. My first thought was that it was an outhouse, but if it was, I didn't understand why they’d built it underground. Getting closer, I realized there was a soft yellow light glowing in between the rotting planks. Curious, I slipped inside.\n\nI found myself in a room the size of a horse stall. The floor and walls were dirt, and a flimsy ladder on whisker-thin strings trailed back up to the door, with the bottom planks roughly stacked together into a pile. The only other adornment in the room was an ornate wooden table that stretched from one edge of the space to the other perfectly. \n\n Lying on top was a body so decayed it was unrecognizable, its blood staining the wood beneath.\n\nMy heartbeat quickened and I frantically tried to go back the way I had come. I bolted towards the back door of the farmhouse and pushed inside, glad there weren’t any zombies guarding this door. Inside the kitchen was huge, the unwelcoming cleanliness offset by soft, reassuring yellow light bulbs. A thin, red-headed woman was finishing washing some dishes in the sink, and once she was done I followed her to the front door, where a kid about my age stood in a slouched but determined position, peeking out a small glass window at each passing car. In his hand gleamed a long, sharp-looking kitchen knife. \n\n“Is he here yet?” The woman asked.\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Do you think he ain’t coming?”\n\n“Of course he’s coming.” The woman scolded. “These retired police types can’t resist putting their noses in everyone else’s business.” I laughed despite myself, grateful I was invisible. **(Dennis’ Note: Now I see why you felt the need to include this dull conversation)**.\n\n“Maybe he could help us instead, Ma,” the boy replied cautiously.\n\n“I already told you no once, Jacob.” She jerked a strictly pointed finger outside at the corpses. “The only way we get what we want is if we use him.”\n\nMy fear froze into understanding. Clearly I was right about them lying to Dennis. I also felt confident that these two had sacrificed a real person in exchange for something, but somehow it had gone wrong. Now they were going to sacrifice Dennis to make it right. I scoffed. Part of me had wanted to believe the old man, that these people really did need help, but after this conversation I didn’t need to hear more. I walked out the door, leaving the two as prisoners in their own home until we  could make things right.\n\nI considered immediately going back to tell Dennis what had happened, but remembering the results of my earlier experiment I decided to talk to Travis first. He wasn’t hard to find; between gaming and practicing guitar he hardly ever left his room when it was as cold as this. Once I arrived I was grateful to see the ghost listening device sitting on his desk. \n\n“Knock, knock asshole. I think I’ve found a way to beat Dennis.”\n\nThat night, everything was in place. There were a few things Travis and I needed to do once Dennis was inside his barn, but for now all we had to do was wait. I glanced at the time on Travis’ phone and exhaled eagerly, glad I couldn’t feel the cold. The ghost hunter would be getting ready to feed his cat any moment now, and would realize he wasn’t inside the house. Travis was holding the cat in question, shivering, though the old tom seemed quite content stealing his warmth. After a few more moments of waiting, silent save the raging wind, we heard Dennis’ voice.\n\n“Wesson? Come back to the house now. It’s feeding time.” \n\nThis got the black cat to perk up, and he began writhing against Travis’ grip. I nodded to my friend and he lightly tossed Wesson towards the first of many tuna cans. He yowled indignantly for an instant until he landed on his paws, then his nose twitched and he began feasting on the tuna, then made a quick dash towards the next can. Travis and I exchanged a triumphant look as Dennis called his cat a few more times to no avail, then shut the front door of his house. A few minutes later the door opened again, and I heard the crunching of snow as Dennis trampled towards the barn. “It’s too cold to be outside, you old flea-brain. Where are you hiding?” He tried to flip the light switch but couldn’t, and I grinned. Everything was going according to plan. \n\nI palmed the jar of herbs I had concocted earlier and slowly made my way towards the empty horse stall where we had placed the last tuna can. Dennis was just heading inside, murmuring comfort to his horse in the adjacent stall as it snorted and stamped its hooves anxiously. As soon as he did, his foot snapped a small trip wire, which released a net from the ceiling. The ghost hunter cursed as he stumbled forward and was pinned to the ground by the thick rope. “Where are you, kid? You have your fun?” He growled as he tried to sit up. My laughter echoed between both Dennis and Travis’ speakers as I wandered into the stall and sprinkled the mixture onto the trap. As I did so, the net became invisible and phased right through Dennis. Travis offered the surprised old man a hand to help him back on his feet, and he took it reluctantly, his jaw set against aching joints. “How on earth did you manage that?” He asked as we made our way back to the house with Wesson in tow. \n\n“Learned from the best,” I replied with a smirk. “I just kept throwing together whatever dirt I could find until I stumbled across something that worked.”\n\nDennis laughed. “Not bad, boy. I knew you would figure it out.” He glanced at Travis, who was shivering even more now that we were unprotected from the wind. “Let’s get inside. I have some stew on that you can eat.” Travis chattered a thank you and we made our way into the house. \n\nDennis was more than willing to let me recount the events of the day while they ate and spare him from having to make awkward small talk. I had only told Travis about my experiments, so the information was new to him as well. He stopped me almost as soon as I started. “I can open Gabbie’s phone.”\n\nI raised my eyebrows. “You know the password?”\n\n“No. But remember when I dated Gabbie for like three months? She had me put my fingerprint in her phone so I could read messages if she was busy.” \n\nI laughed. “Wasn’t that years ago?”\n\n“Feels like yesterday.” Travis sighed with exaggerated fondness. “The eighth grade dance. She was my first kiss.” I rolled my eyes and snorted approvingly as Dennis smacked him lightly upside the head. “Dumbass. I’ll go grab the phone. I hope it’s as useful as you think it’ll be.” Wesson trotted after the old man, enticed by the frayed strings on his pant legs.\n\nI watched Travis scarf down another mouthful of stew, suddenly feeling overwhelmed by the emptiness and envy that filled me. “I guess this is it.” I mumbled to my friend.”I mean, I’ll stay as long as I can, but after this…” My words trailed off. I had no idea what would happen after I disappeared, but none of my guesses were pleasant.\n\nTravis didn’t respond right away. He glanced out the window, where the hilltops were still well outlined by reflecting snow. “I won’t forget you, man. And for what it’s worth, I think you'll go someplace better.”\n\n“You already know there’s something afterwards,” Dennis remarked as he returned. “No reason there ain’t another.” Their words eased my anxiety, and through what felt like tears, I told Travis to get on with it. \n\nThe first thing we searched was the messages, but a quick search didn’t reveal much. Travis suggested the pictures next, and I agreed. So we looked through the most recent pictures, and found only one that was clear enough to make out any details. There was a large, looming figure with wings that must have stretched over 20 feet. Where its eyes should have been there seemed to be only fire, which illuminated long, jagged teeth.\n\n“What the hell is that?” Travis asked in a low tone, as if not wanting to get the picture’s attention. \n\n“Hell is right,” I murmured, describing the altar I’d seen. “I think it’s a demon.” The wrinkles on Dennis’ face deepened as he frowned. He suddenly seemed much frailer in comparison to this nightmare. Tapping away from the image, Travis continued scrolling through the pictures until he put the phone down urgently, his eyes wide. “Chase, look at this.” At first I didn’t understand what was wrong; it was a picture of the same figure, just at a slightly different angle. \n\nThen I understood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe picture was dated over a year ago.",

        "text": "Vincent Mandalay. \n\nThere was a time, not all that long ago, when my name had been respected, praised, worshiped even, by the critics and elites within the cutthroat world of Hollywood filmmaking. Since I could speak, I’ve only spoken in the language of cinema. My earliest memories from childhood all center around my father and our weekly trips to the multiplex, followed by passionate debates over the intricacies of “the process” by the fireplace. Our time in this world was cut short, as I would lose my father before the start of high school after his failing health and decades of bad habits finally caught up to him. I vowed to keep his memory alive with every movie ticket and bag of popcorn I purchased thereafter.\n\nIt was my father’s reputation as one of the most sought out editors in the business that allowed me a foot in the door, but not much further. Never one for making friends, my icy exterior did little to win favor with my colleagues, though teachers and professors would acknowledge my talent while encouraging me to learn the value of teamwork. I resisted them, perhaps out of spite, as the era of auteur filmmakers in which I’d grown up had inspired me to master my skills in all areas of production. The stories I wished to tell were too personal, too thoroughly crafted in my head for others to be able to help in the translation to celluloid. I thought I could become a lone wolf film crew, a Renaissance man of the motion picture.\n\nIt was my final thesis project that would earn me the golden ticket into Hollywood. A little sci-fi romance called *Starry Eyed*, about an astronaut lost out of time who crash lands on a distant world and falls in love with an alien princess. A little high concept for sure, but without the usual smoke and mirrors most genre pictures were known for. Instead, taking place almost entirely within an interstellar dive bar, the picture was more of a collage of vignettes, all tied together by a singular love story for the ages. The various alien humanoids, all in relationship dramas of their own, sought to destroy this forbidden love due to their inability to see their own failures, and the tragic finale saw the two loves jettisoning themselves into space on a small shuttle, their next destination unknown. \n\nWhile showcasing it for my college's film festival, it would catch the eye of producers who just so happened to work for the studio my father once had, Sunrise Studios. They met with me following the film’s premiere, telling me they were impressed with my work but not surprised given the talent my father had displayed during his tenure there. After some small talk, they offered me the deal of a lifetime. The producers at Sunrise felt the film was almost ready for a theatrical release, but needed a few reshoots to beef up the runtime and correct some mistakes. It would be on a tight budget, with Sunrise overseeing the remainder of production. But providing everything went smoothly, I was offered the standard royalty rate and copyright ownership of the title *Starry Eyed*. Of course I accepted and would actually end up missing my own graduation ceremony in order to begin the first day of reshoots.\n\nIt was no surprise to me that the film won its fair share of box office success, but it was the critical adoration, the endless universal praise that truly went to my head, fueling my already supremely overfed ego. An immediate Best Picture frontrunner, the film would eventually earn seven Oscar nominations, though sadly would win none. The crushing loss didn’t matter much to the studio nor I, as such oddities were common throughout Hollywood. I’d already set my eyes to the future, determined to annihilate everyone’s expectations with my next cinematic concoction. \n\nIt didn’t take me long to find my inspiration. In March of 1980, the once sleepy volcanic mountain of St. Helens, tucked away in Washington state within Cascade mountain range, reawakened with titanic force. Within seconds the entire region felt the pent-up rage of mother earth as millions of tons of pulverized rock and ash descended upon the entire region. In total, 57 deaths were confirmed amongst hundreds more left injured and or homeless. As fate would have it, just before the disaster, I’d found myself doing a bit of light reading on the topic of volcanology and historical eruptions. The fabled story of Pompeii came up naturally, and I became mesmerized by the images of the doomed citizens, frozen in place as they ran in terror from the inescapable power of Mt. Vesuvius. I envisioned the same kind of universal love story from *Starry Eyed* unfolding during such an eruption set within a futuristic Pompeii. The massive 78 page treatment was written in just three weeks and its title, though I couldn’t have known at the time, would go on to become one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.\n\n*Pompeii Inferno*\n\nSunrise initially balked at my treatment, saying it was too expensive for my second feature and that *Starry Eyed*’s “modest success” did not warrant control over such a large blockbuster. Undeterred, I edited my treatment to include fewer characters and less focus on the actual spectacle. I even did the unthinkable; offering to forgo my entire director’s salary in favor of a sweet backend deal, providing the film was a box office hit. The studio was enticed by this offer, and after a few days of negotiations, they came back with a list of demands of their own if the picture was to be made. \n\nContrary to their previous statements about budget, they now wanted a bigger focus on spectacle and a large cast made up of the top talent in Hollywood. I had no problem with this initially, seeing it was a massive win on my end, until I was informed by the head of the studio himself that the leads were to be approved by them directly. A minor annoyance for sure, and I wanted to protest. I was given a list of actors and actresses the studio saw as “bankable”, though to be honest most of them inspired zero confidence. The female lead would eventually go to an actress that had been the lead of one of the studio’s successful horror franchises, Evelyn Furrow. Being a fan of the series and the actress in particular, she wasn’t a tough sell for me.\n\nUnfortunately, for various reasons, the list of names for the male lead dwindled down until there was just one. Salary disputes, schedule conflicts, lack of interest, hell two of them even came down with pneumonia the day of the audition. Whatever reason they gave, my patience wore out until just one name was left, who’s placement on the list had been done so on purpose. I had hoped, no, *prayed*, that I could lock down *any* of the other potential options beforehand. \n\nMario De Luca.\n\nA name anyone reading this will certainly know, especially in light of recent events. He’d come seemingly out of nowhere from some small village in northern Italy to Hollywood, shortly after the release of the revised edition of *Starry Eyed*. Just shy of 21, his first film role had been a minor supporting character in a low budget crime drama, but his charming yet sardonic performance won over audiences and critics alike. He would go on to become one of the few actors to win an Oscar for their debut performance. Since then, he’d continued to win countless awards as his films pulled in huge numbers at the box office thanks to his adoring fan base. \n\nBy all accounts, I should’ve been thrilled to have such an esteemed actor in my film, not to mention his huge and dedicated fan base willing to support every project with consistently massive returns. Better still, he was an incredibly attractive young man with a slim but athletic physique, and his intoxicating Italian accent added the perfect garnish to an already admittedly attractive appetizer. Although considered a sex symbol by many, his humility and commitment to social issues had won over even the harshest critics, and his background in sailing and engineering allowed him to overcome his “himbo” persona” that had won him so much acclaim. \n\nEveryone fell for it immediately, except for me.\n\nWhy was I the only one that saw it in the beginning? He was a good one, an actor that is. I’ll give him that much credit. Our first meeting would be right after the Oscar ceremony in which he’d won his first award. Outwardly, he did nothing wrong or disrespectful to offend me. Quite the contrary. His warm compliments of my film seemed genuine, and I myself had admittedly been impressed with the performance of the fresh-faced newcomer. \n\nIt was his eyes. “*The eyes are the windows to the sou*l”, a popular saying no doubt, one told by my grandmother to my father and then so on to me. If this is true, then there was nothing I could decipher from the soul of Mario De Luca that night. His smile was bright, his tone was pitch perfect, and he had just dropped his now trademark “*island off the coast of Tristan da Cunha*” story that would become one of his signature hits. \n\nAlmost every box was checked off but one. \n\nHis eyes. They were this unnerving shade of brown, almost black, with his irises practically indistinguishable. The eyes that had a tendency to follow you no matter which direction you went. Stoic and unchanging, they were the kind of eyes that burned straight through to your soul, resisting any and all attempts by their owner to simulate emotion. I could feel the gears behind his head moving, attempting to reverse course and eventually settling for heaping even further praise upon my work as well as my father. It didn’t work, and from that point onward, our paths would not cross again for several years. I retreated into my own little corner of Hollywood, and soon our brief encounter slipped into the recesses of my memory. I’d hoped to never have another interaction with him until his name was forcibly brought back into my life. “*I have my reasons*” is all I could say when the studio pressed on why I was so resistant to his casting. \n\nThere *was* another matter outside of Mario himself that concerned me. His fanbase was, by most accounts, a respectable group of people who just so happened to admire Mario’s work and were happy to support his projects to the fullest extent. But being such a large group, it meant there were more opportunities for “nutjobs” and “loonies” to slip through the cracks. Reports of incidents of stalking and harassment were common and on more than one occasion, Mario’s house had been the subject of burglary and vandalism. Since then, Mario had assembled a security team of sorts to escort him to and from sets, interviews, and pretty much any social engagement. I worried about the expense and hassle of having to factor in his “entourage” into the budget, I worried about disruptions to the set and film, but more than any of that, I worried about just having Mario on the film, period. It was the first of many bad omens for the project, one that I should have heeded when I had the opportunity to.  \n\nThe “audition”, as it were, went off smoothly, with Mario sitting down in front of me, the casting director, and an executive from Sunrise who’d come to facilitate the likely deal that was to be made later. His trademark smile was glossier than ever and his tailored denim ensemble was certainly a bold choice but still made him look like a million bucks. I almost didn’t catch it, until our last encounter came back to me, and I remembered.\n\nHis eyes.\n\nBefore they’d been a deep brown, almost black. \n\nNow, a warm chocolate had filled in the previously voided out irises. \n\nWhat sort of trick was it? Contacts perhaps? It would be very much like Mario to start wearing contacts just to win over one person. I couldn’t give it that much thought but it was certainly off putting at first. It did the trick though, as before long, I found myself getting swept up in his effervescent charm just like everyone else. His flawless climatic monologue to his character’s lover as the city is engulfed in flames was certainly one for the books. He was so committed, so in tune with character and the emotion of the scene, one could have easily believed the audition tape was part of the film if placed in. I could tell he’d studied the script, as he delivered the dialogue flawlessly while adlibbing a few lines of his own that I was a tad jealous I hadn’t written myself. \n\nGiven his offer was already guaranteed by the studio, the executive and casting director were ready to sign right then and there. My input was merely a formality, it wasn’t required. Even though I’d been more than a little swooned by his performance, there was still that initial meeting, that flicker of the void that I saw in Mario’s eyes the night we first met. I wanted to say “*no, please find someone else, anyone else*”. It was too late though. This was so much bigger than just my treatment. Money was being spent, sets had been constructed, the Hollywood Hype machine was already in motion. I rationed at the time that I was going to work with many actors, and it was not possible that I would like every single one of them. Mario was just one of many “bad eggs” I would come across in this line of work, and there wasn’t anything even “bad” about him. It was entirely my paranoia alone and nothing else. What did it matter if we had to work together for this one project? \n\nI signed off on the deal with no hesitation, eager to get production started as soon as possible, but requested a meeting alone with Mario right afterwards, just to talk about the character. His team looked rather annoyed with this request but Mario waved them off effortlessly and soon we were alone for the first time. There’s been much printed in the media since this has all come to light about our “meeting” that day. I’ll tell you his cunning charm had certainly worked wonders, as all traces of that initial encounter were all but erased. The preceding years had certainly been good to both of us, and I was happy to stay in my little corner while he continued his swift ascent to the top. No shady backend deals were made, and certainly no plans were discussed on what would eventually transpire. I simply wanted his input on the character, what he liked, disliked, his permission to add the improvised lines to the script, and one final question about why he wanted to be involved in the project. His answer was swift and to the point, as if memorized beforehand. \n\n“*Who wouldn’t want to be a part of one of your films? With this movie, together you and I could become immortal!*” said with the verve and veneer of the best car salesman alive. When you flash a mug like his and smile like you’ve just fallen in love for the first time, how could anyone resist such a charm? \n\nWith casting in place, an estimated budget of around $45 million secured, and the entire Seattle backlot of Sunrise Studios completely transformed into a cyberpunk rendition of the Italian countryside, *Pompeii Inferno* would officially commence production on July 23, 1982 with an expected release date in the summer of 1983. It would be going up against big titles such as Return of the Jedi, Superman III, and Psycho II, a competitive release schedule for sure. The studio and I, though, were more than confident our original piece would stand out against the standard Hollywood fare. The first day of shooting went off without incident, as would the next few weeks. \n\nMario and Evelyn, by all accounts, got along swimmingly. Their chemistry was off the charts, so passionate that you truly forgot you were making a movie whenever they were on camera together. It was quite the experience in person, seeing two of the most talented actors of their time bringing my screenplay to life. The crew speculated endlessly about a potential affair, while the studio execs were already formulating a PR stunt involving the supposed “couple” following the end of production. The studio had spared no expense when it came to set and production design, and there had been fear in the beginning that it had been too big a gamble to make on an untapped IP. But ever since Mario had been officially signed on, the studio had been practically radio silent, deferring to my direction when any issue arose. \n\nIt wasn’t until the first month of shooting had wrapped, that the trouble began. \n\nIt all started over dinner, which would later be called “The Last Supper” by the trades. We’d just started filming the initial eruption of the volcano, and after ten hours of being covered in both fake and real sweat, ash, and dirt, the entire cast and crew and I were ready for bed. But not before a lovely last minute supper prepared by Mario himself. An Italian wedding soup that had been in his family for generations, or so he claimed. It had been a welcome and refreshing denouement to a particularly stressful day, though it would quickly prove to be fool’s gold.\n\nMario had eaten his bowl rather quickly and helped himself to a second bowl before the rest of us, and so *of course* he was the first to display symptoms. I’d just sat down and was about to take a bite when a loud crash caught everyone’s attention. Mario had dropped his bowl and was caught stumbling out of the hotel dining room, mumbling something under his breath no one could hear. Several members of his team followed him out, and while it quickly became a hot topic of gossip, no one felt anything off for the first twenty minutes or so. \n\nBut once *it* hit, it struck hard and fast. \n\nEverything changed at once. Slowly at first but more rapidly as the minutes ticked by. The room started spinning while waves of euphoria washed over most of us, though a few muted screams signified others were not so lucky. One of the SFX guys told everyone to stop eating while laughing hysterically. In between his uncontrollable fits of mania, he managed to spit out that the food had likely been laced with *molly*. My symptoms remained relatively mild all throughout, so it wasn’t all that bad until the vomiting kicked in. The hotel staff had been more than accommodating before this, but were brought to the gates of hell and back that night. I can’t even imagine the smell in the morning when they were finally able to start cleaning. \n\nThe first ambulances didn’t show up until well over an hour later, when the hallucinations finally kicked in. I don’t remember much, other than the occasional sensation of total weightlessness, which was not as fun as you might think. There’s more than one testimonial of me being seen desperately clinging to a lamp post as I was escorted into an ambulance. In total, more than 40 members of the cast and crew were hospitalized that night, most for minor symptoms. Almost all of us were dismissed that night, though they did end up keeping the SFX guy who’d first warned us for observation. Evidently he’d had a second helping of Mario’s Italian wedding soup…\n\nand a third…\n\nand a fourth…\n\nSunrise, however, wasn’t laughing at the situation. A meeting was called with myself, Mario, the studio president, and several other execs two days after the incident to discuss how it happened in the first place. Mario denied putting any drugs in the soup, pretty adamantly and emotionally too if I may add. Even I doubted at the time he could have done it, given how against character it was. With no other suspects, the entire incident was being chalked up as an expensive fluke, one that should not have happened under my watch. At least, that’s how the studio president felt. I was, after all, the writer, director, editor, producer, and cinematographer of the project. I truly was “the last man standing”.\n\nIt was disheartening, how swiftly the studio turned on me, probably not wanting to upset their new golden goose. Mario, the martyr that he was, did all he could to take away the blame, but the studio stood firm on their assertion that the entire ordeal should have been avoided. Someone always ends up being the scapegoat, and so I begrudgingly took their verbal reprimand and offered my reassurances that a meeting of this sort would not happen again. \n\nHistory, however, would prove otherwise, as just a week later, a meeting with the very same group of people, minus Mario, would meet for an entirely different reason.\n\nLeah Fenway.\n\nA legend from the Silver Age of Hollywood, we were beyond ecstatic when she returned the *Pompeii Inferno* script with a note that read*“What a piece of shit! Where do I sign?”*. I still have that script and note framed and sealed in a vault to this day. A tough as nails stronghold of a woman, she still brought an aura of grace to all her scenes as the “Cassandra” of our film; a volcanologist that attempts to warn the citizens of Pompeii about the impending eruption, only to be killed in a freak accident shortly before the volcano explodes. Her scenes had already been completed by the time of the “Supper” incident, and it was thought that she hadn’t been present when the soup was served.  \n\nIt would appear not, as just a day after the meeting with Mario and the studio president, Leah would be found in the middle of the set by a crew member, dead of an apparent heart attack. \n\nWhen Leah’s autopsy report was released, it showed trace amounts of MDMA in her system. Surveillance footage of the studio also showed Leah stumbling onto the set by using her keycard to gain entry. How the alarms still weren’t set off, no one knows. Nothing appeared to have been sabotaged, and there was no reason the motion sensors shouldn’t have alerted security the moment she arrived. All that was certain is that Leah wandered onto the set, managed to get down one of the “streets” before ducking into an alleyway, not to be seen again until her body was discovered hours later. The news spread fast and within days, paparazzi and media junkets from all over the country had poured into Seattle to cover the story. Naturally, word of the “Last Supper” also leaked and soon, tabloids all over the world were spreading the “*news”* of our allegedly cursed production, detailing both the molly incident and Leah’s death in grim detail. \n\nIt was a PR disaster, the kind every film production prays never happens to them. There’s precedent of course, a cast or crew member dying during production isn’t out of the ordinary, though it’s usually due to negligence or a pre-existing condition. Leah, as far as we knew, had a clean bill of health the day she signed on for the film, and given the lack of clues at the scene or any explanation as to how she got onset in the first place, it was beginning to look like yet another “freak accident” of sorts. \n\nOur second meeting was a contentious one. I was of course deeply apologetic, offering to address Leah’s family and fans personally and donate my backend percentage to Leah’s estate. The studio wasn’t impressed and told me point blank the only reason they weren’t shutting down production that day was because of the massive expense already incurred. As is customary, the studio had already planned out a promotional campaign over the next year which included tours of the *Pompeii* set, toys, costumes, and multiple endorsement deals. This time, there was no beating around the bush, no slap on the wrists. It was made abundantly clear that no more incidents were to be tolerated going forward. This was officially my “second strike” as it were. \n\nThere was nothing to be done, “the show must go on”, as we love to say in show business. Production though was allowed to pause for two days in order to give us all time to grieve. Leah’s family, which had mostly consisted of her many adopted children, hounded the set everyday from that point onward, determined to take down both the studio and me along with it. Threats of a lawsuit floated around but nothing had come of it at that time. The once joyous and playful atmosphere quickly devolved into a near constant state of mourning and paranoia, everyone wondering who or what would happen next.",

        "text": " \n\nHave you ever had to share a bedroom before? It’s not too awful, except when you want to just turn off your brain for a while and vibe to your music.   \n Bullet For My Valentine is blaring through my headphones while I continue making spirals on the cover of my notebook, I retrace them enough times that the pages are starting to peek through.  \n “Hey, rude!” I yell at my sister as she unplugs my headphones from my iPod. “The fuck is your problem?” My twin Abby rolls her eyes at me from behind her fake eyelashes. She reminds me of the really bitchy, blonde girl from that movie mom watches once a year, some shit about wearing pink on Wednesdays. Spoiler alert, she gets hit by a bus. Sometimes I wish I could hit Abbigail with a bus.   \n “Your music is stupid.” She smacks as she chews her bubble gum, “I’m watching my shows and you’re leaking goth, teenage wannabe at me.”   \n   \n “Aww, don’t let me interrupt your “I need validation from men to base my self-worth on but also let Johny dipshit use me as a cum dumpster” show.” “Sorry, I forgot you were trying to take notes.”   \n “You bitch!” Abbigail throws my headphones at me and storms back out of our room.”  \n I cannot wait until I get out of here. I can’t stand my sister. She gets so sucked into her reality tv shows sometimes that I think it might literally be rotting her brain now. I hear her turn on the living room tv and then I plug my headphones back in and just close my eyes. The song has switched to “Broken” from Seether. I close my eyes and just lay my head down on the cool side of the pillow. My eyes start to get heavier and my breaths deepen the rise and fall of my chest. I should really turn off the TV but I’m just too tired to climb down my loft bed ladder right now.   \n I wake to silence. My iPod died and the room is quiet all except for the static of the tv. I guess I should actually get up and turn it off before I osmosis this toxic shit in my sleep. I sleepily climb down the ladder and rub my eyes. I could’ve sworn that the tv was full of static before I came to turn it off, but now it’s playing a horror film. I doubt Abby would’ve changed the channel to anything interesting so it must’ve been one of our dad’s horror films left in the blue ray player because it’s not something I recognize from Netflix, I’ve already watched all the horror shows and movies on there.   \n I plop down in the giant bean bag chair and grab my notebook. I like to draw creatures inspired by horror movies while I watch them. The girl in the movie is sitting close to an old-school tv while a high-pitch frequency and static come from the tv in front of her. That must be what I was hearing when I woke up. I look down at my notebook and start to draw. I glance up and down, trying to follow along with the movie but I keep drawing less and less. I catch myself with my eyes glued to the tv and losing track of time. The girl is standing in front of the tv now, you can see a bright blue light illuminating her shadow on the wall behind her.   \nI look back down at my drawing and all I see are spirals now. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the static part, the middle of the tv clears and it looks like someone’s eyes are peeking out at me. I quickly glance back up to see the girl still standing there. The screen on my tv goes black and then starts to count down from 5, there’s a loud hum coming from the speakers and I realize I’ve been holding my breath. My heart is beating inside of my ears and my lungs are on fire. I blinked at the clock and it said 4 am. I don’t remember 4 hours passing. My eyes are watering and there are more spirals on the page, they’ve been traced so many times they penetrate the next 5 pages of my notebook.   \n I shut the tv off and climb up the ladder to get a couple more hours of sleep. I turn on my side trying to get comfy and I hear the tv turn on again.   \n “I wish someone would quit leaving this damn tv on.” I huff at Abbigail, but she’s not in here with me tonight. I don’t know what grace of God let that happen but I have our room to myself for the night. Once again I climb down the ladder to turn off the tv but it’s the same movie replaying from earlier. “The fuck?” I whisper under my breath. “Is she trying to play some kind of weird ass prank on me?” I think to myself.  \nI grab my notebook from the floor to put it back on my desk when my eyes are once again caught by the tv. I feel like I’m drowning in a sea of black and white pixels while my ears burn from the quiet static growing to a deafening silence in my ears.   \n “Anna”, “Anna”, I hear my mother yelling with panic in her voice.  “Annabelle!” \n\nI blink up at her from the bean bag chair, my body aches and I feel the numb tingling you get whenever your arm falls asleep. I shake it off and start to stand. What a weird fucking dream, I think while I turn the tv off.   \n “Annabelle!” My mother sounds almost desperate in her tone this time. “Have you seen Abby?” I hear her yelling louder but it almost sounds like she’s yelling through a tunnel now. I open my door and head down the hallway, something doesn’t feel right. I think my leg might’ve gone numb too, the tingling almost hurts as I start walking.   \n “What mom?” I yell back as I’m making my way through the house. I catch my reflection at the end of the hallway. My eyes. My eyes are a pool of black and white pixels, static pulses like water drops on a speaker. The sound rings through my ears and I grab my head, it feels like my head is literally being squeezed like a nasty pimple. Everything turns white and goes quiet.   \nI blink but it doesn’t matter, I try blinking faster but all that accomplishes is the static getting worse. I can’t see. Am I still texting youare you getting this? I’m moving my fingers but I can’t see what I’m swiping anymoer. HEllo? -3(p me please. help.",

The board will now decide the fate of the two officers. The following transcripts below are the calls that took place outside, and inside the Argent Apartment Building. \n\n**Branchview 911 Dispatch Center - December 2nd, 2022 - 10:29 PM** \n\n**Call One - Connected - Started at: 10:29 PM** \n\nDispatcher: \"Branchview 911 dispatcher center, what's the location of your emergency?\" \n\nCaller One: \"Yeah, I'm in the parking garage inside the Argent Apartment Building?\" \n\nCaller One: \"Some absolute psychopath must've smashed up my car. I need like, the cops or something, for their report so I can get an insurance claim or whatever.\" \n\nDispatcher: \"Police have been dispatched to your area, they shouldn't be long, can you describe in greater detail the condition of your car, and what car the police should be looking for?\" \n\nCaller One: \"It's a black Nissan Armada, 2022 edition. Bought it like four days ago.\" \n\nCaller One: \"This is so messed up, I'm taking a closer look, and someone *definitely* took a bat to my car. I didn't even do shit to deserve this...\" \n\nDispatcher: \"Can I get your name real quickly?\" \n\nCaller One: \"Darren Haddox.\" *(caller correctly identifies himself)* \n\nDispatcher: \"Do you know who the police should be looking for that did this to your car?\" \n\nDarren Haddox: \"No clue, I was \\[going\\] (emphasized) to go out to a bar with some buddies, and I come down from my apartment building, and see this shit show of a car staring back at me!\" \n\nDispatcher: \"Are there any cameras in the area that police might be able to access?\" \n\nDarren Haddox: \"Nah, the only one here has been broken for... a while.

Don't ignore me, asshole.\" \n\nDispatcher: \"Police are eight minutes out, Darren you should seriously just wait inside your car until responders arrive.\" \n\nDarren Haddox: \"Hell no!

Upon entering the scene, Darren Haddox was not found anywhere in the parking garage, as well as the described \"homeless witness.\" Darren Haddox's car was found at the scene, smashed by a metal baseball bat. Pieces of a phone were found a few feet away from the car, but not enough to immediately conclude it was from the one used to make the call. Seeing there was no one to talk to about the vandalism, Officers McKinley, and Brown six minutes after arriving at the scene got another call about a nearby home burglary in progress and decided it would be better use of their time to respond there. They arrived at that scene at around 10:46 PM.* \n\nA twenty-year-old college student placed a call approximately three minutes before McKinley and Brown arrived at the scene, calling to report a, \"suspicious drunk man\" outside their apartment rooms door. The apartment in question was the Argent Apartment Complex. \n\nThe transcript of that call is located below. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ev99d/does_anyone_remember_a_kids_show_titled_laughing/",
        "text": "My father was a police officer in the 1990s, and he told me about a strange series of cases throughout New England where the children had apparently killed their parents while the parents slept. Sometimes the kids would slit their parents’ throats while they were sleeping, while other times they would douse the house in gasoline and burn them alive. A couple of the children chopped their parents up with axes while their parents slept. But all of the kids had one thing in common- they said they had watched a show called Laughing Island before committing these horrific crimes.\n\nNow there is no record of a show by this name ever existing, but all of the children described it exactly the same way. It would start with a puppet called the Grinning Man dancing around the screen. The Grinning Man puppet had hundreds of sharp teeth and huge jet-black eyes, and would often start the show by teaching the kids about safety. He would play with lighters and matches and show how playing with these toys could burn down his whole toy neighborhood- laughing the whole time while other puppets would burn, screaming and running around in front of the cameras while on fire. They used canned laughter every time the Grinning Man would accidentally kill the other puppets in his neighborhood, covering up the screams of the puppets with uproarious laughter from the audience.\n\nHe would teach the kids about knives by running around the island with the knife pointed out, accidentally skewering any other puppets who got in his way. They would show real blood flowing from the puppet’s wounds, the camera zooming on their screaming faces as the audience laughed.\n\nThe Grinning Man would also play hide and seek with the kids on the island, real children who would hide around the set while the Grinning Man put his head down and counted to thirty. When he found a child, he would grab them and the child would start screaming, and never be seen on the show again.\n\nMy father told me all of this with a whiskey in his hand, his grizzled salt-and-pepper stubble making him look far older than he actually was. He had retired early with a pension after being shot in the leg by a drug dealer during a traffic stop gone wrong.\n\n“But you know what the craziest part about this whole Laughing Island thing was?” he asked me, his eyes watery and unfocused. I shook my head.\n\n“When the family of the kids went to check on them while they watched the show, they said the kids would just be staring at a black screen. The TV wasn’t even on. Sometimes the TV wasn’t even plugged in. Kids would go up in the attic and watch old TVs that hadn’t worked in years, but they claimed they could see the show, bright as day, and they explained what happened during it. Nearly all of those kids are dead now, though some are still catatonic in mental asylums around the state. They don’t talk, they don’t move, they just sit there like statues, staring off into a world that none of us can see.\n\n“But after the crimes were committed, the kids were full of energy and talking a mile a minute. They were bursting at the seams with joy! They claimed that the Grinning Man had told them they needed to teach their parents a lesson about safety, and that now that they had followed his instructions, he would come for them and take them away to Laughing Island, where every day was like Christmas and it was illegal to be sad or angry. \n\n“If anyone was sad or angry, a massive puppet called Sheriff Hogan would arrive. The way these kids described him, it sounded as if he was dressed like a Nazi SS soldier, with pure black military clothing, polished high leather boots and a gleaming black leather cap. He was ten feet tall and towered over the little children, who often wet themselves out of terror when they saw the Sheriff Hogan puppet arrive. He would take them to the center of the island and bury them alive, telling them in a sing-song voice, ‘No angry kiddies, no sad kiddies, no evil kiddies and no bad kiddies on Laughing Island.’ They would scream the entire time while the puppet threw them in a hole and filled it with sand and dirt, but after a few minutes they would stop screaming. And the rest of the kids knew what would happen to them if they ever got sad or angry on Laughing Island, so they always had forced grins and pretended like they were always happy.”\n\n“Could this have been some sort of mass delusion, like the Salem Witch Trials?” I asked. “Maybe one kid just made up the whole show in his head and told other kids at school about it, and it spread like some sort of urban legend. Maybe it was just a coincidence, like the mentally ill children who would most likely be violent anyways were the ones affected by the urban legend.” My father shook his head, his flabby cheeks shaking as he did so. His bottom lip quivered for a moment, then stilled.\n\n“There was no connection between the children. We checked. They all attended different schools, different daycares, no shared bus routes, no shared friends or family. It was eerie how the Laughing Island thing seemed to spread across the city, and then across the state. The news made it into a moral panic, like the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, but no one knew exactly what to do about it. Then one day, it just stopped.” He looked up at me. “At least, we thought it did. I just got a call from an old cop friend, who is now Captain of the city police, and he said a six year-old kid just drugged his parents and skinned them alive. He butchered the job, but after hours of trying he managed to get most of the skin off. Apparently he was wearing his father’s skin like a mask, running around the streets and laughing when the cruisers found him. And guess what he said?” I shook my head, not even venturing a guess.\n\n“The kid said that the Grinning Man made him do it.” \n\n“That’s… really sick. And sad,” I said, not knowing what else to say. My father nodded grimly.\n\n“It is. I only wish we could find some way to stop it.” I looked out the window and realized it was getting dark.\n\n“Well, dad,” I said, “I have to get going.” My wife was watching our child, but she wanted me home for dinner. He nodded.\n\n“Be careful out there, son,” he said. I drove home through the darkening city streets, thinking about everything he had said. I couldn’t imagine such atrocities being committed in our city, of all places- and by *children*, at that.\n\nWhen I got home, I took a few deep breaths in my car, trying to clear the horrifying conversation from my mind before going inside. As I entered the living room, my breath caught in my throat.\n\nI saw my five year-old son there, sitting inches away from the TV, watching a totally black screen.\n\n“What are you doing, son?” I said. He turned to me, his pupils dilated to cover his whole iris, his mouth a sick grin of pleasure that allowed me to see every one of his baby teeth.\n\n“Just watching the man on the TV, daddy,” he said, He pointed to it, and as his arm neared the black screen, his finger actually went *into* the TV, as if the black screen were nothing more than liquid. As soon as he did, ripples began to form across the glass, and I saw with horror that something was coming out of the TV.\n\nFrom my father’s description of him, I knew it was the Grinning Man puppet. The thing stood six feet tall with white, rubbery skin, like some reptile from a cave that has never seen sunlight. Its jet black eyes bulged like golf balls out of its massive head, and its entire head split in half to show a mouth that had hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. My son clapped his hands in delight at the arrival of his TV friend, jumping up and down and singing, “No sad kids! No bad kids! Now we go- to Laughing Island!”\n\nI saw with terror that my son’s hands were not empty. Before I had gotten home, he had gone into my room and stolen my .45 handgun. Now he pointed it at me.\n\n“Sowwy daddy,” my son said, still smiling a grin from ear to ear, “but the Grinning Man says you have to come with us.”\n\n“David,” I said to my son calmly, “put down the gun. You don’t have to do this.” He just shook his head at that, then pulled the trigger.\n\nI felt like I was punched in my leg, a wave of warm pain rising up to my consciousness as I fell back then landed hard on the ground. I looked down and saw my pants were stained in blood, a massive bullet hole having gouged a way out of the right side of my shin. I screamed in pain, crawling away from my son and the Grinning Man.\n\nThey came at me then, the Grinning Man lifting me by my shoulders. My son clapped and danced as he carried me towards the TV. As I passed by him, I grabbed him by the hair, and with adrenaline-soaked fury, I grabbed the gun from his little hands. Then I began to fire blindly behind me, where the Grinning Man stood behind me, still carrying me slowly and singing.\n\nI heard a few of the bullets make contact with a meaty thud, felt him drop me, then I started to black out from the blood loss. The last thing I saw before I went was my son’s eyes clearing and his expression returning to normal.\n\n“David, call 911,” I whispered, before falling away from this world in a wave of blackness.\n\nI awoke in the hospital sometime later, my leg bandaged with countless wrappings. A police officer and doctor stood next me to my bed, and behind them I saw my wife, weeping. They told me she had been tied up in the kitchen during the whole ordeal, that my son had drugged her and immobilized her with many layers of ropes, using the knots he learned to tie his shoes with to keep her in place.\n\nThey told me if my son hadn’t called 911, I would have bled out within twenty minutes. They had done emergency surgery but I would likely have a limp for the rest of my life.\n\nThere was no sign of the Grinning Man, of course, and my son refused to speak to anyone. They said he was catatonic, currently under psychiatric observation, just staring up at the ceiling like a waxen puppet.\n\nI will do everything I can to bring him back to us.",

        "author": "cotard_corpse",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10euml3/i_found_a_cardboard_box_filled_with_old_8mm_tapes/",
        "text": "[Tape 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zwvz34/i_found_a_cardboard_box_filled_with_old_8mm_tapes/).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI took a break from looking through this box of 8mm tapes. For some reason, I felt slightly disturbed by the first tape I wrote about. I’m not usually easily scared, but, admittedly, I had a few nightmares after viewing The Department Store video. I mean, I watch *tons* of scary movies, so it really shouldn’t be an issue. But I think it was the combination of grainy quality mixed with how genuinely terrified Ted and Frank appeared. I know, I know. *Obviously*, it’s fake. It has to be. Still, it hit me hard. I’m even reluctant to digitize the tape–like it’s almost *too* spooky to share.\n\nAnyway, today I had some free time after work so I set up in my living room and got back to digging through these tapes. It’s been somewhat laborious because a lot of them are empty or only have a few minutes or even seconds of footage. But I have to scrub through the entire length (120 minutes!) to make sure I’m not missing anything. It takes forever. Some of the tapes are entirely empty. Others have footage but it doesn’t show up until halfway through the tape. What kind of psychopath would start recording *in the middle* of a tape? It’s absurd.\n\nThat’s the case with the tape I’m sharing today, which I’ve labeled below. This one is shorter than the first, but no less puzzling. And, well, it seems clear to me there’s some kind of connection between the two. I’d welcome any thoughts about possible explanations.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Tape 2: The Bird with the Hand**\n\nThe first twenty-two minutes are blank. Just a blue screen with a timestamp. In this case, it reads January 4, 1995. Suddenly, the screen goes black and then white. There’s the distinctive click of a lens cap coming off and then the crunch of snow. The camera’s aimed towards someone’s boot-clad feet, trudging along a sidewalk among dead oak trees.\n\nIt’s an overcast day and the person behind the camera is breathing heavily. It must be very cold. The landscape reminds me of the Midwest, leading me to believe this tape was filmed in the same region as the first. How do I know that? Call it a hunch, but Midwesterners can sort of spot their own people and places. The only indication I see in the entire tape of an actual location is a brief clip of a street sign: Honey Hollow Lane.\n\nThe faded green of that sign is in the first few minutes of actual footage, before the person filming veers off a residential road and down a snow-covered gravel path. Eventually this path seems to disappear, the person’s–a woman, I think?--breathing growing more belabored as they break through fresh, deep powder. Aside from the constant hiss endemic to this sort of old tape, there’s an eerie stillness. All you can hear is that steady, deep breathing and the crunching of snow.\n\nFinally, after what feels like an eternity, the videographer finally speaks, “Fucking unreal. I knew Ted was full of shit. There’s fucking *nothing* out here. Fucking prick.” Her voice is one of clear irritation and at one point she sweeps the camera back in the direction she came from. Her long line of slightly crooked footprints are visible in the deep snow. She seems to be contemplating turning back.\n\n“Fuck, fine. I’ll give it a little longer. There better be *something* here.”\n\nTwigs snap beneath her heel. She moves her hands into frame to push away thin, black branches. I can almost hear the frustration in her movements as she pushed deeper into the dense forest. But then there’s a gasp.\n\n“Whoa…Holy shit.”\n\nThe camera pans upwards and she steps into a circular clearing. It’s all fresh snow, with no signs of human or animal tracks. This makes it all the more strange that a few feet away from our nameless videographer is what appears to be a tape. Interestingly, it’s *not* covered in snow. It appears to have been very gently laid–in its plastic case–in the dead center of the small glade.\n\n“That’s really fucking weird,” she mutters, “it wasn’t supposed to be a tape.”\n\nWait. What was it supposed to be? Clearly, there’s a lot of context missing here.\n\nShe steps forward, intent on retrieving the tape, but just as she bends down there’s a sound. A high-pitched *caw caw*. The first evidence of another living thing in those woods.\n\n“Huh…” she moves the camera upwards, scanning the treeline for her avian stalker. The bird–a crow, I think–comes into view, but the camera is out of focus. She zooms in, with the primitive camera slowly auto-focusing as she does.\n\n“What the fuck is that?”\n\nThe crow is holding something in its talons.\n\nShe takes a few steps forward.\n\n“A…a fucking *hand*?”\n\nBut it’s a pale, porcelain white.\n\nA mannequin’s hand.\n\nShe screams.\n\n“What the fuck?!”\n\nBut she’s not referring to the crow. The next few seconds of the video are an absolute blur, but I slowed them down, advancing frame by frame so that I could see what happened. She swoops the camera’s focus down towards her ankle–something is grabbing her. Another hand? It’s so white, it nearly blends into the snow.\n\nThere’s the sound of a struggle, “Get the FUCK off of me!” She kicks and falls forward, lodging the camera into the snow a few feet from her head. I can only see it for a split-second, but there’s an entire *circle* of hands around the tape. They’re vibrating, twisting, shaking the snow that surrounds them. Then there’s a high-pitched wailing from somewhere in the distance. I hear scratches. The woman? I can see her in the corner of the frame, moving desperately, face down, clawing into the densely-packed powder.\n\nWhatever it is keeps getting closer. The wailing growing louder and louder and louder and–\n\nSMASH.\n\nThe lens cracks, but through the splintered glass I can still see it. I can see her getting *dragged away*. Her hands leave desperate trails.\n\nWhite noise.\n\nThe recording ends.",

        "text": "Alright, so. I told Uncle Henri about the [napkin](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10bszza/frozen_pizza_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). But believe it or not, that conversation was only the second most interesting thing that’s happened in the last few days. \n\nIt went…okay. Henri was disappointed in me, for sure. His stern look made that very clear. But he didn’t chastise me too much. He simply sighed and said, “Well, you’re eighteen now. You make your own decisions, and you can take care of yourself. Just make sure you’re carefully thinking about those choices. Perhaps a little more carefully than you’ve been doing.”\n\nSomehow that was worse than yelling. But I got through it, and when I showed him the napkin, he got oddly quiet. “This is concerning,” he finally said, staring into the fire.\n\n“Do you think the murderer has been here?” I asked. “Do you think we’ve *met* the killer?”\n\n“Maybe,” he answered absentmindedly. I could tell his mind was racing a million miles a minute, considering endless possibilities. “Or maybe it means something else entirely.”\n\n“Like what?”\n\nHenri tore his gaze away from the fire and met my eyes. “Maybe…there’s someone else out there who blurs the lines between dimensions.”\n\nMy breath caught. “Someone…like me?”\n\nHe sighed. “*Similar,* perhaps. I can’t imagine there’s anyone just like you, Ian.” His small smile was warm as he reached over to pat my hand. “You’re one of a kind.”\n\nI shoved the chair back as I got to my feet. “That’s great, Henri, but if this someone who can exist in both worlds like me, do you know what that means? They could murder people limitlessly in *both* dimensions!”\n\nHe sighed again, clasping his hands on his desk. “Oh, I know,” he said gravely. “I hope that is not the case. I’m not sure if it’s even an option. One being with your…*abilities* is already unlikely. Two would be nearly impossible. That’s just not heard of. But we cannot rule it out yet.”\n\nMy own mind was now racing as pieces fell into place. “But if that’s even a ‘maybe,’ I *am* the best resource we have to hunt down the murderer! I can cover both dimensions so much more quickly—and safely—than sending out human and Neverland search parties! Uncle, you’ve *got* to let me help!” I’m not ashamed to say that I slammed my hands down on the desk for emphasis.\n\nHenri didn’t even blink. “Your willingness to risk your own life is admirable, Ian. But it would still be dangerous for you, especially if the murderer—dimension jumper or not—realizes you’re looking for him. Taking out *one* individual is much easier than an entire force.”\n\n“I wouldn’t go alone!” I argued in exasperation.\n\nHenri tilted his head. “Whose lives would you be willing to risk, then? Who do you wish to put in harm’s way with your uncontrollable jumps and the threat of murder? Is that worth the risk?”\n\nI thought of Milo, of accidentally pulling him to the human dimension, of some dark mysterious killer crucifying him like that poor fairy. I swallowed hard and slowly sat back down. “I don’t know.”\n\nHenri sighed again. This one was deeper, somehow, sad and dark. “I don’t either,” he said mournfully. “We’re losing so many already. I don’t want to put others in danger, but if we do nothing, they will continue to die.” His lilac gaze had drifted to the flickering fire again. “There are no good answers.” Suddenly he blinked as if coming out of a trance and looked at me. “Thank you for bringing this to me, Ian. I’m sure you didn’t want to admit your…adventure.” He gave me a small smile. “I am glad you did, though. You’ve given me a lot to think about.”\n\nAnd before I could ask again about my role in all this, Henri was ushering me out the door, promising we’d talk again soon, once he’d had time to consider some things and talk to his oldest friends. \n\nWell, a few days and another murder later—a werewolf riddled with silver bullets in her own basement—Henri agreed to let me do a little searching. He looked as exhausted as I’d ever seen him. Usually, Henri looks put together, every inch the powerful creature he is. But lately, he hasn’t been himself. He has bags under his eyes that wouldn’t qualify as carry-on luggage, and he hasn’t shaved in days. I don’t think he’s sleeping. I’m pretty sure he considers each death a personal failure of his. \n\nWhich is why, after a lot of whispered conversations late at night with his ancient friends, he told me that he’d let me help. “Not all the time,” he said firmly. “We’ll start small. I want you to be safe. Just return to doing a couple of errands, and you can extend them a bit to investigate if you see anything suspicious.”\n\nIt was enough. I was a little worried, of course, but mostly happy that I could get out of the bar without having to sneak under Henri’s nose. Besides, I’ve almost died so many times at this point. I wouldn’t say I’m *used* to it, but I can handle a bit of fear.\n\nAnyway, like I said, that development is only the *second* most interesting that’s happened. The other one is much, much bigger.\n\nI went on an errand yesterday. My first since Henri gave me the green light—okay, well, more of a yellow light, I guess. He made me triple-check that I had my knife, my lighter, four—yes, count them, *four—*crosses made of different materials around my neck, and one of Henri’s own pistols. Extra protection was one of his requirements for letting me go.\n\nIt was just me. We’d had an argument about the risks of going alone versus not, and for once, I won. I was more nervous about killing someone via my dimension jumping than via running into the murderer, and at the rate I’ve been uncontrollably jumping, I didn’t want to risk it. Uncle Henri didn’t like it, but he saw my logic, and he reluctantly agreed—for now. “If you get hurt, or anything goes wrong, you’re not going alone again,” he’d said in his end-of-discussion voice. Oh, and the extra protections were required.\n\nThat led to me setting out to a city in Neverland to deliver an oddly-shaped package to a gnome. I swear the package squeaked and moved as I held it under my arm, but I didn’t want to think about that too hard. Knowing gnomes, it could be anything.\n\nI won’t bore you with the details of my travel between Griffin’s Edge and the gnome’s garden. I made it there just fine, of course. Things always wait to go downhill until I get close to successfully completing an errand. My atoms stringing me along with a sense of false hope, I suppose. Thanks, atoms.\n\nThis time, I actually passed off the package—the way the gnome smiled and stroked the package when I handed it over made me *very* uncomfortable—and had started to search for a gap to return through when out of nowhere, a door slammed close by.\n\nAnd I jumped. I’ll give you two guesses as to where I ended up.\n\nThat’s right: the dark forests. It was a mild relief not to see Jacian again, but I think I’d still generally choose them over the monsters I might find in these trees. I threw my hands up in frustration. “Come on, *really?*” I shouted into the air. “What, you started to miss me after a few weeks?”\n\nWell, yelling into the dark forest was not exactly my smartest idea. Turns out that’s a pretty good way to draw unwanted attention from beasts in the area. Which, in hindsight, I probably should have considered before taking out my exasperation on the surrounding darkness.\n\nBut I didn’t, and I realized my mistake nearly immediately as I received an angry, echoing roar in response—one that sounded awfully close. \n\nI cursed my own stupidity under my breath and cautiously moved forward, dead black leaves crunching beneath my feet, reaching out one hand to feel for tears in reality’s fabric and keeping the other on Sgrios’ handle. \n\nNo doors. Another roar, even closer. I could have sworn that one shook the trees. “You’d think I’d get used to this after doing it to myself all the time,” I muttered. “But no.” \n\nAnother roar, and now I was *sure* the trees shook. For that matter, so did the ground, and a second later, a three-headed monster burst into the clearing, snapping branches in its wake. I had just enough time to process that it looked like a massive Komodo dragon with one matching head, one goat’s head, and one panther’s head before it roared yet *again,* close enough that I felt its hot breath. And that made me realize that I should probably stop looking at it and, you know, flee.\n\nSo that’s what I did. I spun around and took off sprinting through the trees. Unfortunately, very little light snuck past the gnarled canopy above, and the monster had much better night vision than I do. As I stumbled through the twisted trunks, beating back thick branches and struggling not to trip over layered roots, it merely crashed through the woods behind me, steadily gaining.\n\nI cursed out loud and debated the merits of stopping to fight versus continuing to run. *Maybe it doesn’t like knives. Or crosses…?*\n\nYou know how people in horror stories always seem to trip and fall at the worst possible times when they’re being chased by a killer? Even if there’s literally *nothing* in their way to cause it?\n\nIn my defense, there *were* things in my way: lots of gnarled, knotted roots, some of them covered by leaves and mud and impossible to see, plus branches and tendrils of dead ivy hanging down from overhead. But yeah, I did trip. And as a nice added bonus, I skinned my knees and palms on the impact, and it *hurt.* \n\nGroaning, I flipped over and tried to scramble backwards across the roots. Every touch of the rough bark cut deeper into my scraped palms, though I tried to ignore this as I shifted to an awkward, one-handed backwards crawl and pulled Sgrios off my belt with my other hand. Blood dripped down its blade.\n\nThe monster was ten feet away or so and had slowed to a stalking creep forward, all six of its eyes locked on me. I saw the anticipation in its faces as it drooled; it was a predator preparing to finish off its prey, and it knew I had nowhere to go.\n\nI swear I experienced it all in slow motion. The monster’s muscles tensed as it crouched, readying itself to pounce; I quickly traded Sgrios for Henri’s pistol and steadied it to fire; I felt the damp soil soaking into my pants and heard its heavy breath. Then everything sped up, not only to normal speed but even faster, so that it all happened simultaneously: branches snapped somewhere overhead, the monster leapt, I fired the pistol.\n\nAnd the monster exploded into flames. Roaring, screaming, it staggered backwards, stumbled into a tree trunk, and collapsed to the ground. I watched in shock as fire burned through its skin and scales. The smell was *awful.* \n\nInterestingly, though, the fire didn’t spread to the surrounding trees or blanket of dead leaves. I watched as it began to die to embers, leaving behind a mess of ashes, acrid flesh, and scorched bones. My gaze drifted to the pistol in my hand. “I know Henri’s got some firepower, but I find it hard to believe you did that with one bullet,” I said to the gun.\n\n“Oh, it didn’t,” said an amused voice. Something about it was weirdly familiar. “I did. You’re welcome, by the way.”\n\nIt was coming from above me. Suddenly, the snapping branches I’d heard overhead right before I’d fired the pistol made sense. Rather than get to my feet—I was still breathing kind of hard, and my hands really hurt—I let myself fall onto my back and, lying there on the ground with mud soaking into my shirt, I looked up.\n\nA teenager sat on a branch, back against the trunk of the tree. My heart skipped a beat as I took him in: skin pale as a ghost, wavy hair as dark as the surrounding woods, eyes even darker. Casually lounging there, one knee up, one leg dangling. Exactly the way the mysterious eight-year-old kid I’d encountered a decade ago had perched. The kid whose very existence I’d doubted more and more in the years since, but who I was now certain was not only very real but was also sitting in front of me. \n\n…And who had just saved me again. Which meant he’d saved my life *both* times we’d met. Which was honestly kind of embarrassing.\n\nHow did I even respond? It had been so long. He was probably deadly, and I couldn’t imagine why he’d appear to me again now all these years later. But for some reason that I couldn’t explain, I was a little excited to see him. If for no other reason than to figure out what the hell his deal was.\n\n“I would have been fine,” I argued. \n\nHe raised his eyebrows, looking amused. “I seem to remember you saying the same thing the last time we met. And it wasn’t true then either.”\n\nHe *did* remember our first meeting! My heart was pounding. I had so many questions I wanted to ask. *Respectful,* I reminded myself. *Don’t piss off potentially dangerous beings.* “It’s been a while,” I said carefully. “I was beginning to think I wouldn’t see you again.”\n\nHe smirked and leapt down off the branch, landing as lightly as if he’d stepped down off a stair. He crossed the distance between us in two steps and stretched out a black-gloved hand. I hesitated only briefly before I accepted it and let him pull me to my feet. If he wanted to kill me, it probably wouldn’t be via helping me stand up.\n\nNow upright, I realized that he was slightly shorter than me, and that he gave off an aura unlike anything I’d sensed before. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Darker, maybe. Certainly powerful. It was almost like a *void,* rather than an aura. One thing was for sure: even if he wasn’t acting murderous right *now,* he was absolutely dangerous.\n\nHe was also still smirking as he sized me up. “I’ve been watching you,” he said. “You’ve been showing up here more and more often.” He tilted his head, his grin growing wider. “A lot of close calls.”\n\nI looked down at the shredded skin on my palms and winced. “You just enjoy watching me almost die? No desire to help? Real nice.” (So yes, I did immediately abandon my ‘be polite’ rule. Something about him made me forget it entirely. Sue me).\n\nHe laughed, a genuinely amused laugh that sounded entirely too gleeful for such a bleak place. “Big talk from someone who I’ve saved *twice.* Remind me how many times you’ve done something for me.”\n\nWell, I hated to admit it, but he had a point there. Not like I’d give it to him that easily, though. “Show up more than once a decade and maybe I’d get the chance.”\n\nHe was smirking again, though I swear his inky black eyes twinkled. “Touché.” \n\nWe were silent for a moment, considering each other. I still had so many questions, but I couldn’t seem to focus on any of them. I was still reeling at the fact that he even *existed,* or that teasing him felt as natural as joking around with Milo. Surely it was concerning that I got along this well with a creature from the dark forests. Surely it was a trap. Right?\n\nSo then why couldn’t I quite get myself to believe it?\n\nOur silence was shattered by a low, guttural growling from the undergrowth behind him. He didn’t even get a chance to turn before a monster resembling a saber-tooth tiger—just like the one that had chased me a few weeks ago—leapt out from the bushes, directly at his head.\n\nIt was a blur. Acting completely on instinct, I shot at it with Henri’s pistol, which was still in my hand. Now, I’m not a bad shot—Henri made sure of that as I grew up—but I’m not exactly in practice, and firing at a fast-moving target right by someone’s head? Risky even for an experienced shooter. Even riskier for me.\n\nLuckily, I hit the tiger. Not-so-luckily, I hit the tiger by passing *through* the pale kid’s shoulder. I stared in shock as the monster collapsed to the ground, smoke blossoming from the bullet hole. Thank God for whatever magical bullets Henri had in here. Guess I should’ve tried those on the three-headed guy from earlier.\n\nI shot it again for good measure, right in the skull. Just to be safe. I’m not in the business of letting my guard down only to get attacked again. No, thank you. I get attacked enough already. \n\nThen I turned my attention to the pale kid—only to find that he was staring at his shoulder in mild interest as thick, black blood oozed from the small wound. “You shot me,” he said, sounding almost amazed.\n\n“Not on purpose,” I argued. “The monster got it worse. In fact, I think that counts as *me* saving *you.*”\n\nHe chuckled, still staring at the wound. The flow of blood seemed to be slowing already, almost as if it was freezing in place. “You’re not as good at it, then.”\n\n“I’m plenty good at it,” I muttered, annoyed. The smirk playing at his lips made me think he’d heard me. Damn it. \n\nEither way, I guess he wasn’t too broken up about it, because as I was mentally debating the risks versus necessity of taking him back to [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/) for Henri’s healing skills, he reached up to pull the collar of his black jacket away from his neck…revealing only a dark, bruise-like smudge where the bullet wound had been a moment earlier.\n\nWell, there went the ‘necessity’ argument. I stared in surprise. “Did you just heal yourself?”\n\nHe let his jacket settle back into place and shrugged, avoiding my eyes. “Something like that. It’s really not a big deal.”\n\nMy thoughts were rapidly becoming a racing, wild mess. What the hell *was* he? I couldn’t recall anything I’d ever read or heard about a creature like him. The closest I could think of was a vampire, but I’d met enough vampires to know he wasn’t one. Not enough fangs, and he hadn’t so much as glanced at my bloody palms. Plus, vampires don’t have black blood. In fact, they don’t bleed at all. \n\nI knew I shouldn’t, but I couldn’t help it. “What are you?” I breathed, my voice barely more than a whisper. \n\nNow he raised his head, and his dark eyes met mine sharply. They were unreadable, the irises as black as the pupils within them. “I could ask you the same thing,” he said matter-of-factly, as if we were merely discussing the weather. \n\nMore silence as we stared at each other. I hoped the pounding of my heart wasn’t as obvious as it sounded in my own ears. I wanted to ask what he knew, why he cared. But I was scared to give anything away. Despite the feeling I’d had earlier that I kind of liked talking to him, it didn’t change the fact that he was an unknown being native to the dark forests who had black blood; could heal himself; had a deeply powerful, void-like aura; or had been *watching me.* \n\n*He's not as human as he looks.* I had to remember that. Should be easy, in theory. I mean, neither am I.\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” I finally said, fighting to keep my voice even. I clenched my fists to hide their sweatiness, ignoring the pain in my torn-up palms. \n\nHe smiled slowly. “I’m sure you don’t.” Then he laughed. “Doesn’t matter. You’ll be back. And with your skills, I’ll no doubt have to save you again. We’ll have more chances to talk.”\n\nLike hell was I letting him get away with his little trash talk that easily. “Oh yeah?” I challenged. “Sure you’re not gonna vanish for another decade?”\n\nHe considered for a moment before smiling again. “Nah,” he said. “You’re too interesting. I have a feeling you’re going to be important.”\n\nI swear my heart stopped for a solid five seconds. Could he sense something about me? Was he psychic? Magical? “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n\nHe tilted his head, squinting his eyes as he looked me up and down. “I don’t know yet either,” he said. “But I will.” He grinned. “See you around, Freckles.” \n\nThen he was gone. I blinked and he had vanished entirely, as if he had simply dissolved into the shadows. And hell, maybe he had. I didn’t even get the chance to respond indignantly to the nickname. \n\nI still don’t know what he is, and I couldn’t quite bring myself to tell Henri about him. Just like I couldn’t when I first met him ten years ago. I don’t know. It just seems like I shouldn’t. Some little voice in the back of my head insists that this should be kept to myself.\n\nI told Henri about the jump to the dark forest, of course. I had to tell him when he healed my hands. I just omitted the part about the boy in the tree.\n\nI couldn’t stop thinking about him after that. I keep replaying his words in my head, wondering how much he knows or if he could help me figure out what I am. I laid awake all night, trying to make sense of him and his return. Just I was finally about to drift off to sleep early in the morning, something new occurred to me: is it merely a coincidence that he’s shown back up *now,* when my jumping is getting worse and when something is out there on a murder spree? Or is it all connected?\n\nAnd, well, you better believe I didn’t sleep a goddamn *wink* after that.",

        "text": "My husband and I have the best relationship. We have been married for 24 years and counting. He still makes breakfast for me every day and I still tell him I love him every night. We have our divergences, but we work through them as a couple. As a team.\n\nIt wasn't always like that though. We met almost 30 years ago. I was 19, he was 21. We were madly in love from the start. So much that I thought it would be fitting to change our wedding vows from \"till death do you part\" to \"for eternity\".\n\nAfter we had been married for around a year, we started trying for a baby. We tried and tried... Until we learned we couldn't have children. My uterus was \"the wrong shape\", according to the doctor.\n\nAs in many other cases, this put strain in our relationship. The stress and resentment started to build up on both ends and we started fighting. A lot.\n\nFirst came some small disagreements. Then they started growing and growing. By the end, every small thing would end up in a screaming match.\n\nOne day, I was doing my stuff around the house and needed to pee. In a hurry, I sat on the toilet without looking. I gasped in horror as my body sank and my butt touched the porcelain inside. I got up and saw the seat was up.\n\nI marched to my husband and started yelling at him. \"Can't you just leave the freaking seat down? Are you that much of a baby?\". He opened his mouth to answer me but he just closed it back, closed his eyes and sighed. \"I need some time alone\". With that, he went for the door and left in his car.\n\nThat night, the police came to my door, telling me he had been in an accident. They said he was at the hospital, in critical condition, and that I should go there as soon as possible.\n\nI could not bear my regret. I started sobbing and asked the officers if they could take me there. I was in no condition to drive. They looked at each other and the one by my doorstep said \"ma'am, this is not standard procedure but sure, we'll give you a ride\".\n\nFrom then on, my memory is patchy. I read that's a normal response to trauma. I remember the doctor saying they weren't sure he was gonna make it. I remember seeing him hooked to all the life support machines at the hospital. Next thing I remember is him at home already.\n\nThe accident left him on a wheelchair. Because of that, I was now mostly in charge of everything, but he still tried to help. Two or three days after he came home, I remember him saying \"I want to cling to life, and you are my life\". From then on, we realized our problems were tiny compared to losing each other, and our fights stopped. We still have disagreements, but we talk about them as a couple.\n\nBecause of all the trauma and being on a wheelchair, he didn't want to leave the house ever since. I respected his will for years, but at this point, I felt like he really needed to go out. So I booked a surprise vacation for us at a place that is accessible for wheelchairs. Today I was looking for the reservation papers (I'm a bit messy and I lose stuff easily) and I looked in a drawer that I rarely use. I found a paper and checked if it was it.\n\nRight now I'm packing. I'm not sure where I'll go, but I'll go alone. My husband asked from the kitchen \"baby what are you up to?\" and I replied \"just tidying up the wardrobes\". I can't let him know.\n\nI mean, how do you tell someone you found their death certificate?",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a small town nestled in the heart of the woods. The town was called Ravenswood, and it was known for its peacefulness and tranquility. The people who lived there were friendly and welcoming, and the town had a strong sense of community.\n\nBut, as with any small town, there were always rumors and legends that circulated among the residents. One of these legends was about a mysterious figure that was said to haunt the woods surrounding Ravenswood. The figure was known as the Raven Man, and it was said that he had been cursed to wander the woods for eternity, never finding peace.\n\nThe legend of the Raven Man was well-known among the townspeople, but most shrugged it off as nothing more than a silly story. However, there were a few who believed that the Raven Man was real, and that he was a dangerous creature to be avoided at all costs.\n\nOne such person was a young girl named Emily. She had always been fascinated by the legend of the Raven Man, and she had spent many hours exploring the woods in search of him. But despite her efforts, she had never found any evidence of his existence.\n\nOne day, Emily decided to take her search to the next level. She decided to spend the night in the woods, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Raven Man. She packed a bag with supplies and set off into the woods, determined to find the truth about the legend.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Emily settled down for the night in a small clearing. She built a fire and settled in for the night, keeping a watchful eye out for any sign of the Raven Man.\n\nAs the night wore on, Emily grew more and more restless. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching her, and she found herself constantly looking over her shoulder. But despite her unease, she refused to give up her quest.\n\nJust as she was about to drift off to sleep, Emily heard a noise in the distance. She sat up, straining to listen, and soon she heard it again. It was a low, mournful howl, and it seemed to be coming closer.\n\nEmily's heart began to race as she realized that the howl was coming from the direction of the Raven Man's supposed lair. She grabbed her flashlight and set off into the woods, determined to find the source of the noise.\n\nAs she walked, the howling grew louder and more insistent. Emily could feel her heart pounding in her chest, and she knew that she was getting closer to the Raven Man.\n\nFinally, she came to a small cave at the base of a large, moss-covered tree. The howling was coming from inside the cave, and Emily could feel her fear rising. But she knew that she had to see this through.\n\nWith a deep breath, Emily stepped into the cave. Inside, she found a large, dark chamber. The howling was coming from the back of the chamber, and Emily could see a faint light shining in the distance.\n\nShe walked towards the light, her heart racing. As she drew closer, she could see that the light was coming from a small fire, and sitting beside the fire was a figure.\n\nThe figure was dressed in a long, dark cloak, and its head was covered by a hood. And perched on its shoulder was a large, black raven.\n\nEmily's heart skipped a beat as she realized that she was standing face to face with the Raven Man. But instead of feeling fear, she felt a sense of calm. The Raven Man looked up at her with a sad, mournful expression, and she realized that he was not a monster, but a man who was trapped in his curse.\n\nThe Raven Man told her his story, of how he had once been a man who had loved the woods and the animals that lived there. But one day, he had angered a powerful witch who cursed him to live as a Raven Man forever. He told her of how he had wandered the woods for centuries, never finding peace or redemption.\n\nEmily felt a deep sense of empathy for the Raven Man, and she knew that she had to help him break the curse. She spent the next few days researching and studying ancient texts, looking for a way to free the Raven Man from his curse.\n\nFinally, she found the solution. She would need to gather certain herbs and perform a ritual to break the curse. She set off into the woods, determined to find the herbs and break the curse.\n\nWhen she returned to the cave, she performed the ritual and the Raven Man was finally free from his curse. He thanked Emily for her help and disappeared into the woods, finally finding the peace that he had been searching for.\n\nFrom that day on, the legend of the Raven Man was no longer whispered in fear, but told with a sense of hope and redemption. And Emily was known as the brave girl who had freed the Raven Man from his curse.\n\nBut, some people say that on certain nights, when the moon is full and the woods are quiet, you can still hear the howling of the Raven Man. And some say that if you're brave enough to follow the howling, you might just find the Raven Man, now free from his curse, still wandering the woods.",

        "text": "I appreciated all of the thoughtful comments that Redditors left on [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10d39zy/last_summer_i_opened_an_adventure_park_after_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).\n\nSo many of you seem desperate to know what drove the final nail into the coffin. First of all, I failed to mention a few egregious events.\n\n**Crying on the Carousel:**\n\nAfter u/Jeffinj420 suggested that the land might be possessed by something, it reminded me of a dreadful thing that happened.\n\nA girl started bawling on the carousel, so I offered to babysit. Meanwhile, her parents, obliging her whinging brother, joined the slightly-older boy on the ride for a second time. The little girl, no more than three or four years old, was sobbing profusely.\n\n“Not a fan?” I asked.\n\nI immediately cringed at my atrocious attempt to make small talk with a toddler. The girl cranked her head backwards to gaze up at me, and tears were drenching her cheeks. I’d seen upset children at the adventure park before, but I didn’t see sadness in the girl’s eyes. I saw *fear*.\n\n“It was over there,” She said, pointing at the woods.\n\n“What did you see?” I asked her.\n\n“I’m not supposed to say,” She whispered. “I don’t want it to take me.”\n\nWe stood in silence until her family came off the carousel, and I didn’t tell them what her daughter had told me.\n\n**The Second Ghost Train Incident:**\n\nWhen I told Tess’ tale, I must confess that I was disingenuous. I didn’t divulge *everything* that happened to the poor girl. In my defence, I didn’t really want to talk about the final part of her story.\n\nNo customers ever had any issues on the Ghost Train ride, as far as I’m aware. Nobody ever ran out of there in floods of tears. That should’ve been disparaging, especially when one considers that *real*horrors lurk within those tunnels. Thinking about it, why would a customer ever mention anything strange that they might’ve witnessed? They might’ve just believed it to be part of the ride.\n\nOne evening, I was inspecting the Ghost Train ride. Those tunnels, even when lit with the orange hue of dingy lights, harboured a heavy darkness. Of course, I chalked it up to my imagination. Ever since the night of Tess’ disappearance, I hadn’t been the same person.\n\nAs I rounded the final corner of the tunnel, I cried and rocketed out of my flesh.\n\nA mannequin. Like the ones we found by the obstacle course in the woods, it was wearing clothes. The official park uniform. I already knew what name was printed on the badge. *Tess*.\n\nThe most terrifying thing about that mannequin was its pale, featureless face. As I dragged it out of the tunnels, I took a closer look. It was probably just a drop of water from the ceiling, but it looked like a tear trickled from one of the mannequin’s eyes.\n\n**Clownville:**\n\nEverything disintegrated in August. All of the park’s horrendous tragedies were either secrets or, in the case of D-11, easily rationalised. The actions of the blueberry man had not yet come to light, so it was only the case of the two missing children from the obstacle course that had incited any form of police investigation.\n\nBut our gates were still open. I wish we’d been closed down sooner.\n\nThere’s a story that I’ve been hesitant to tell. It’s about the park section that, for the purposes of anonymity, I shall call Clownville. I wanted to include a miniature circus in the park to distinguish it from my competitors. I suppose I couldn’t really settle on an overarching theme for the adventure park.\n\n“Look at this creepy thing,” Paul said.\n\nMy friend passed me a clown mask. It differed from the others. It had disproportionately-small black eyes. The painted smile on the front seemed far too jolly, and something about a cheerful clown is disconcerting, isn’t it?\n\n“Maybe John wants a special mask that distinguishes him from the other clowns?” I suggested.\n\nJohn was our Chief Clown. It was a title he boastfully bestowed upon himself during his very first circus performance. It made him happy, and that’s the ideal clown, so I allowed it. He always seemed a little too engrossed in the character, but I didn’t really care. The visitors were enthralled, after all.\n\n“What distinguishes John from the other clowns is that he’s a fucking nut-job,” Paul said.\n\nI snorted. “Y’know, Samantha said that she would headbutt John if he were ever to refer to her as ‘Cute Clown’ on stage again.”\n\n“Why did he give them such weird fucking names?” Paul asked.\n\n“It educates the little ones about harmful stereotypes from a young age, and what’s more special than that, Paul?” I asked. “Chubby Clown, Cute Clown, Crazy Clown, and Chief Clown. And the biggest clown of all? The idiot who thought Clownville was a good idea. Me.”\n\nPaul laughed. “With Richard gone, John keeps saying he’s gonna get you up on that stage to perform with him. What’s your clown name?”\n\nI thought for a moment. “Coerced Clown.”\n\nRichard quitted the week before, so I had been trying to find a fifth clown for John’s big Saturday show. Hiring a willing clown in my town was an impossible feat, but Richard’s part wasn’t exactly hard to perform. Plus, he was on a much lower salary than the others, which is why John had called him Cheap Clown. All he had to do was pass tools to the more skilled performers and occasionally crack a joke. I could do that. I just didn’t *want* to do it.\n\nJohn was persistent, however. And as the week progressed, his eagerness for me to perform in his show viciously bloomed. His demeanour was beginning to unsettle people. Since donning the new mask at the start of the week, his mood changed. He’d transformed from strange to sinister.\n\nJohn had always been exuberant and far too passionate about the circus, but he started to develop a feverishness. We never saw him without his mask. Nobody could call him John without invoking his wrath. He was Chief Clown.\n\nBy Friday, many employees were describing John as unhinged. There was a minor brawl in the changing room between him and Keith, who played Chubby Clown.\n\n“I don’t get paid enough for this shit,” Keith fumed. “Either he goes or I go.”\n\n“We know,” Paul said. “But a lot of people booked tickets for Saturday, and I don’t know whether the park could take the financial hit of issuing a refund for everyone. Do you think you’d be able to do tomorrow’s big show? We wouldn’t be able to hire a trained trapeze artist to replace you. We haven’t even been able to replace Richard yet. The boss is getting involved. That’s how you know it’s serious.”\n\nWe managed to convince Keith to persevere. Samantha simply avoided John. Thomas, otherwise known as Crazy Clown, was such a boisterous bundle of madness that he didn’t seem to care.\n\n“This is the most interesting John’s ever been,” He joked with us.\n\nOn Saturday evening, one hour before the seven o’clock show, I was in the dressing tent with Paul and Josie. My sister was trying to make Richard’s large clown costume look a little more shapely on my slender body.\n\n“We need a belt or something,” She said. “Maybe two belts.”\n\n“As long as it stays up on stage, I don’t mind,” I said.\n\n“Might get us a bit more press if you do something like that,” Paul chuckled.\n\nOnce I was ready, I waddled over muddy grass to the actors’ tent in my clunky, uncomfortable costume. It was a rainy night. Loud. Too loud to hear what had transpired in the tent. I’ll never forget the rush of vomit to my mouth when I walked through the tent flaps.\n\nChubby Clown, Cute Clown, and Crazy Clown were all sitting on the sofa before me. Each of them was still and lifeless. At first glance, their masks appeared to have been fastened to their faces, but then I realised that their masks had *become* their faces. Their flesh had been surgically removed, and their clown masks had been unevenly stitched to their heads. There were streaks of blood on the sides of their gleefully-grinning mask-faces.\n\nI’m not sure how long I froze, but I was suddenly aware of guttural breathing.\n\nSquirrelled away in the corner of the tiny tented area, I saw him. John. Chief Clown. He no longer looked human. He was on his haunches. The horrible, black-eyed mask had been stitched to his face. That jolly grin beamed at me. On the grass, I spotted an assortment of bloodied surgical tools and circular strips of flesh. Faces.\n\nBefore I could utter a sound, Chief Clown was scuttling towards me on all-fours. He lunged, and I blindly swung my fist. It connected with John’s jaw, producing an almighty cracking sound, and the deranged sub-human fell backwards. I grimaced in horror at his twisted neck. *I’ve killed him*, I thought.\n\nThen, possessed by some supernatural force, he began to writhe, and he snapped his neck into a horrifying contortion that would’ve killed any living human. His black eyes, surveying me from a masked head that was now hanging upside down, were piercing.\n\nHe screeched in a voice that was like no earthly sound I have ever heard. I gazed into the face of the thing that I was sure would end me. And I knew, in that moment, it was the thing that haunted my land. The king. The thing that girl had seen in the woods. The thing that had reduced poor souls into mannequins.\n\n“Die, you fucker!” Paul screamed.\n\nI didn’t hear my friend enter the tent. I had been too deeply transfixed by the haunting eyes which burrowed into my soul. Chief Clown turned to face Paul, but it was too late. My friend buried the hatchet, both figuratively and literally, disconnecting John’s upside-down head from his torso in a swift motion.\n\nWe both stood there for several minutes, eyeballing John’s decapitated corpse. Paul and I were waiting for the thing that had possessed him to revive his body. Thankfully, he lay still.\n\nA mass murderer. That’s what the police called him. Paul and I knew better. We saw what Chief Clown became in his final moments.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI refuse to sell the park. Nobody else needs to suffer there. That land isn’t meant for us.",

        "text": "The first day I saw him, my mother had just passed away. I was 17 when it happened, nothing more than a background character in a school full of similar souls. I lost my mother to a fire at my high school, which claimed 9 lives. I remember it was a cold day in November, and there was a buzz among the students for the 4 day weekend we were granted in light of Thanksgiving. We were all eager to leave for the break but this prospect hung in the shadow of semester finals which stood between us and our reprieve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom worked as the English teacher for juniors, situated on the lowest floor of the school. We all liked to call her room The Dungeon regardless of the teacher or class offered because the classroom was simply in the basement. The walls that edged the descending stairs were clad in exposed water and gas lines which sat in contrast against the concrete walls. The stairs had that weird rubber or maybe vinyl appearance that all together led to a classic prison presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my science class that morning, working in a small team with my best friend and some girl we used to know. Our assignment for the day? Dissecting baby pigs and identifying their organs. Just kidding. I can't honestly recall much else of that day except that we were working on our finals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything that followed happened so quickly. It was awesome in the way that it was awe-inspiring, but the awe was for the abject fear that ensued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen a tragedy happens, it's the weirdest thing. There's no music to build tension. There's no foreboding presence. There isn't something stitching together inclinations that maybe anything else aside from the ordinary is ever going to happen. The moment it does, however, the moment a travesty rears its foul maw and bares its fangs of misfortune and grief, it comes and goes in the blink of an eye. It quickly leaves only the bystanders and survivors to witness the wake of its unpredictable rage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I recall, we were wrapping up the evidence needed for our report when suddenly my ears popped like I had rolled down the window in a fast-moving car. This was immediately followed by a jarring vibration experienced by the whole classroom and a deafening, concussive force that stole the breath from my lungs. A shower of water followed immediately after. As I swiftly rose from my desk, my chair shot backward and clattered with a startling force against the table behind me. I noticed the blaring fire alarm as my hearing quickly crawled back to my awareness. Our teacher, Mr. Smik, wasted no time and rushed us out of the classroom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were orchestrated by the teachers like frightened animals, herded towards the nearest exit. Down the hall and to the left, downstairs to the lower level, and then outside. When we rounded the corner with my mothers' classroom coming into full view, I was greeted by a conceptual nightmare. I was suddenly and firmly frozen in place. My heartbeat seemed to stop, and yet it was beating harder than it ever had before. I was simply the bystander who was now left to bear witness to this wake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother's classroom door, blown off its hinges, lay against the opposing wall in a splintered heap. The space between the door and frame was filled with an enraged inferno, desperately and forcefully bellowing from within. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what I thought when I ran into that fire. I don't know if I thought I could save her like some invincible superhero or if I was simply running in because I needed to. I don't know. I broke through the wall of flame and smoke, and immediately past the door frame, the fire was no longer burning. I descended the staircase in a manner fitting of an infant, erratic, frantic, and without coordination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost my footing halfway down the stairs and fell with abandon, but I was lost in adrenaline and hardly noticed, regaining my balance on the last few steps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was almost cold once I reached the bottom step. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard someone crying in the room and even though it was almost pitch black inside the veil of smoke, a small window lit the desk where my mom would sit. The person wailing in apparent agony was adjacent to her desk, however. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI broke out in a nervous sweat as I began my search for this crying person, gagging on the smell of burning flesh and hair. It didn't take long for my eyes to dilate accordingly and to return my gift of sight. I still wish they would have failed me just that once. The images seared themselves deep into my psyche, burnt bodies and their wayward limbs littered the floors. Some were smoldering like paper as a thin line of bright red crawled greedily up the blacked skin and turned to ash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat mouth-watering feeling crept through my throat as it does when you're about to throw up. I heaved at the site but managed to hold it in. Through a power only granted to me in the fight of fight or flight, I averted my attention to the crying coming from an overturned desk in the corner of the room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"That has to be my mom.. she's still alive!\" I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached for the desk, almost tripping over the chest of a less fortunate husk. I heard someone yelling at the top of the stairs for me to come out because they had detected a gas leak. I wish I had listened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was almost to the desk when I looked down at another body. This one was slightly larger than the rest. It didn't take long for me to understand that this was my mom.. missing the right side of her face.. her eyes showed a milky white, and her jaw was slacked and opened wide. She had no arm.. or leg. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDead... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother was dead at my feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crying erupted from behind the desk again, with no audible words.. just sobbing. I left my mom's side to help this person. It hadn't fully dawned on me at this point that no one could have survived this disaster. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crying was filling my head. It blocked out the sounds of the fire alarm, everyone screaming for me to get out.. it was like I was lost in a daydream in which the crying was the forefront focus. It blocked out everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached the desk and tentatively peered behind it, and focused on an illuminated figure curled up in the corner. It had blackened skin like the rest of them and almost no hair. It trembled, facing the corner of the wall, Its body lightly convulsing like it was being electrocuted, arms held out beyond its sides with its hands limply hanging from the suspended forearms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"HEY,\" I yelled, \"We have to get out! There's a gas leak!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe figure didn't respond. I thought maybe the explosion damaged its hearing.\n\nI reached over to him and grabbed his hand. He stopped crying immediately when our skin touched.. the trembling stopped but his body kept jerking. He slowly turned his head towards me.. it limply followed his neck in quick little snaps as it turned. And then I saw his face.\n\nLeathery skin stretched across his bony skull, and his wide eyes were like my mother's.. a milky grey and white. Browned teeth showed through a slacked jaw, no lips.. a withered nose sat broken upon his face. He was naked.. the leathery skin continued down his nude frame. Some of the skin was falling off at points of stress.. from which an infected-looking, foul-yellowed fluid oozed forth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at him in shock, his body jerking and heaving... he shuttered as his head rocked and rotated like a newborn to face me. I looked into its eyes as it took a rattled, strained breath.. and bellowed a sound unlike any I'd ever heard. No, that's not the right way to portray this sound. The sound created a feeling inside of me that wasn't exactly mine. I was forced into a feeling of absolute grief. Pure pain. I felt absolutely and completely overwhelmed with guilt unlike any I had ever known. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI threw myself back from the desk and fell upon my mother's corpse. A cloud of ash rose from her smoldering body and washed over my face as I gasped. I inhaled my mother's ash. I vomited on myself as I rose to my hands and knees to crawl away, tears streamed forth like a ruptured dam that threatened my existence. I crawled and then ran once I found my footing. I ran out of that room through the fire. I ran through the school. I ran out passed my classmates. I kept running. I ran and ran and ran until my legs couldn't carry the weight of my body and my experience anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police found me collapsed in a local park. I remember the cold, crisp grass caressing my face, leaving behind wet stains from its melting lash in the throws of my despair. I thought I would have at least run towards home. Instead, I ran in the opposite direction. The officer that found me sat with me in the field for a while and just listened to me sob. He didn't offer me any words of advice, nor words of encouragement. He didn't rush me even when we both were shivering to our core once the cold seeped through our skin and lay with our bones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fell asleep in that field, wishing the air would escape from around me the same way it escaped my lungs between gasps for air my lungs unwillingly forced upon me. I awoke while he drove me home. I remained in my mother's home for a short while at the mercy of my aunt and uncle who were awarded temporary custody of me. I was offered a life insurance payout that was locked in a conservatorship. I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, however, so I'll thank my stars because my aunt didn't take my money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe pulled out the settlement as soon as it was released to her and gave me a big stack of cash, definitely too much for a 17-year-old to have while attempting to remain a responsible member of society. I was quickly awarded emancipation in light of the funding and I began to fuel an addiction that left the hole in my soul full of even more regrets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother few months passed by in the blink of an eye, probably because I was always strung out riding a line between high and barely conscious. As anticlimactic and foreseeable as it was, I ended up overdosing on heroin. I was found by my aunt in my home on my couch. my arm was shoved down between the cushions, searching for the remote that was actually on my coffee table. I had passed out like that and vomited in my stupor. I vaguely remember her scream once she walked through the doorway. I'm sure I looked just like the death I was longing for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was put on suicide watch once the story came to light. My therapist thought that what I saw there was a manifestation of my mind. Like something I created to personify the hell, I had lived in for those few meager minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy weeks turned into months, and progress became a slow burn on my road to emotional recovery. No matter what I was taught, what tools I was provided, and what mental gymnastics I performed, I kept sinking deeper and deeper. The craving for substances kept its sick claws locked tightly around my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next year, I found myself slipping into a reclusive lifestyle. I had dropped out of school that winter and became a shut-in. My life became a blur in the face of depression. I traded one vice for many more, watching porn and gaming all day, loathing my existence late into the long and lonely nights. My experience from school never left me. I had such vicious night terrors, unrelenting and boundless in their pursuit of my rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt my emotional lowest, I stopped caring to meet my basic needs. My body was constantly utilizing kyphosis to keep me alive. I was a vile wreck, becoming the personification of that which was my mind. I was a mirror of my mentality. I was losing the battle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you want to know the truth about depression? It's not some \"woe is me, I'm sad\" bullshit. Depression is the opposite of happiness. Happiness is proactive and engaging. It has to be created and earned to be nurtured and it will grow. Depression is everything happiness is not. Depression comes from stagnation. Depression isn't cured and isn't wanted. It's torn into being, whether you had it from birth and sat on the genetic time bomb, or it was thrust upon you against your will. Depression is the absence of emotion that we innately use to protect ourselves. \"If I can't feel, I can't hurt.\". It's the absence of feeling the desire to care. It is apathetic. Dark and abysmal. Alone and unafflicted. I can't care to eat, I can't care to meet new people, I can't care to shower or brush my teeth. I can't care to keep up with living. I've learned and lived this hell. I hope you never have to, too. If you are? I know it's hard to care, but please talk to your friends and family, or ask someone for help. People will be there for you, you just have to find them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I digress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life started a journey in a new direction, birthed from the ruptured, hemorrhaging existence that I unknowingly came to find comfort in. It was so simple, that spark. I laughed. Not like a chuckle or a little nose smirk. A belly laugh. The sound was foreign to my ears. I was confused but oddly excited. I was so proud of myself. Soon after that, I went from a reanimated corpse to an animated individual. My new addiction was growth. I chased this feverishly. I built myself up and created a dam that could withstand the deluge of my mind, I calmed the rancor that consumed me without fail. I regained control. One step at a time, hand over hand I crawled a feeble yet unstoppable ascent up that mountain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew I had to leave my home to continue my growth. Without a second thought, I left my home to my aunt, packed up, and moved out to Florida.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlorida was great for a short time, I lived in a small vacation cabin by myself in the Everglades. I established myself as a transfer student waiting until next year for my college courses to begin. This was a lie, but one I found some comfort in telling. Thankfully I didn't have to tell it often as no one lived around me for miles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy lot was on private property which was owned by a pleasant couple who were never home. A dense and humid forest surrounded my establishment. This was a treat for me because it gave me time to confront my thoughts and ultimately contributed to my road to recovery from that night. Sure, it was the same reclusive lifestyle, but here I was free. Also, something about 80f in winter was better than I thought it would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe forest surrounding me was beautiful, lush, and vibrant. You could frequently hear the birds sing, and bugs whine late into the evening as the sun departed the sky and lay to rest beyond the western horizon. It was a welcome change from the stark nights of my hometown. I would even go fishing occasionally at an ocean-fed creek just a few minutes from my house. It was exactly what I had wanted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life was mine again. The thoughts of that night, though painful, were easier to experience. I think I was almost able to say \"I'm happy\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil I heard that crying again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few times a week, I would wake up to his crying in the woods late at night, and his lonely howls would penetrate the thin walls of my home on wheels. Why didn't I just drive off you ask? I had a moped I would use to run to town but I couldn't get that to start. Thankfully in that regard, I had plenty of food to get me by for a few months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought maybe the crying was just a relapse of depression.. like PTSD in soldiers. I would stay awake and listen to it, focusing on it as if I was going to find some words within the rattling gasps.\n\nBut it kept getting closer.. every week the sound would get louder. I would lay awake in bed and find myself begging for it to stop. It was the same way it was in that school. It filled my head and blocked out everything. It forced me to feel a torrent of forgotten pain. My dam was fracturing. My rancor was waking up. My battle returned with a windfall that left me breathless. I broke so quickly. So quietly. Like sand in the palm of my hands, my joy slipped away through my fingers. My laugh died in my throat. My mind, so quickly, broke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe uncontrollable sobbing returned nightly as the sun departed, leaving me alone to face this manifestation.. or creature. Entity. The wailing filled my nights until I was no longer able to sleep. I could only sleep during the day. The day was safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at the time.. 1:26 am.. the middle of the night.. but no crying.\n\n I quickly got out of bed and looked out of my bedroom window. Nothing. \n\n\"Maybe.. it was just a raccoon trying to get into my trash,\" I thought. I made myself some coffee to help keep me awake through the night. Coffee had become the only thing I would drink. I made some food.. well.. canned salted potatoes with a hint of chicken dumplings and brought it back to my room. I sat down and addressed my fears as I had tried to do nights prior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately, I'd been convincing myself that maybe I'm witnessing him because I hadn't gotten over the events of that day. Maybe it was a symbol of the worst day of my life, a catalyst upon which my normalcy lay flayed in some blood eagle like fashion. Maybe it's just that my subconscious had unintentionally held onto what could have been and manifested as that in my day-to-day life. I became bold at this rationalization and told myself to go open the front door.. like that was going to make the fear end. I figured if I had confronted the atrocity of my own making, I could also make it go away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI set my food and coffee down as I arose from my seat and shuffled to the front door. There was no crying tonight, it was just calm and peaceful. I placed my face in front of the window on the door as I had been every night before, honestly not expecting to see too much aside from an eerie shadow. But there it was, staring through the little glass window back at me. Face-to-face. Separated by not even half an inch of glass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn eruption of screams washed away the silence and shook my house. My kitchen light showed through and illuminated his face. It's a face I can never forget. His jaw was chattering, gaping, and closing between breaths. As he exhaled, a sticky fog clung in Rorschach patterns to the otherwise unblemished glass. His eyes stared straight ahead at nothing as though he was lost in the grip of indefinite madness. He quivered again as he took several slow, unsteady steps backward and crouched on the ground just feet from my door. He was real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed at him out of reaction. It was guttural and primitive. There were no words I could offer my emotions to appease this sickening sensation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was angry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was scared. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was sick of not sleeping, not having MY life! I moved across this god damned country to get away from THIS and here it was, huddled up near feet from the only comfort I had left. This was some sick fucking joke my brain was playing on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" I managed to yell, my voice cracking as I started to sob. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE!\" my voice sounded more like a dying animal, unrefined and shrill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt kept screaming outside of the house as it rose to its feet again. Standing upright, it walked in slow and sporadic movements back towards my door.. it arched awkwardly backward like the abdominal muscles lost the ability to keep the torso upright, tearing the skin as it leaned. Yellow liquid again seeped from the wounds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE\" I yelled again with a level of emotion I hadn't felt in years, but my plea fell on rotted and deaf ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt reached my door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had rehearsed this moment in my earlier days of coming to the forest. Over and over I would think about what I would do to end my maddening reality. I didn't want to kill myself though, so I had made this \"thing\" the effigy upon which my mental decline rested, and that which should be eradicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my panic and on instinct, I grabbed at the fire axe hanging above my table and mechanically threw my body at the thin door that separated us\n\nA wordless and loud scream of fear, disgust, and hatred erupted from between my clenched teeth as I crashed through my door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat thing was hit by the door, the force unapologetically colliding with it. It fell backward, and a feral gasp emitted from the bottom of his throat. I was going to kill it now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"kill it.\"\n\n\"Kill me.\" \n\n\"Candle\"\n\n\"KILL\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe words echoed on an asynchronous loop inside my mind.\n\nI fell down the steps as my unbraced momentum carried me forward, flailing as I fell to the unforgiving earth. I found myself on my feet before I even processed that I even fell. But then I was face to face with it, its breath was too hot, too sticky. The smell of rot and decay filled my nose. I recoiled in fear at the smell and close proximity. I backed up until I was pressed against the wall of my house. I lost my nerve. I wasn't strong enough. I wasn't capable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt then screamed and heaved and shook in front of me.. its milky eyes still looking beyond me.. hands outstretched. And with the scream, courage returned to me, rage returned to me. It was the same as it was all that time ago in the school. I was feeling something that I wasn't actually feeling. It was my feelings, but I wasn't the one feeling them. It's so hard to explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI embodied these feelings though, and let them wash over me, and consume me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"kill\" The word was on repeat in my head\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sprung forwards and swung my ax with a primal scream, burying the blade deep in its side. The feeling of bone deflecting the axe upwards was a sensation I still haven't forgotten. Blood and other fluids spewed from the wound and it took a few sideways steps in retaliation against the momentum of my assault. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt stopped crying, shaking.. even breathing. Time froze as he finally looked at me. I was rooted in place by my fear. We stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. Eyes locked. That breath returned with a vengeance. Nothing happened beyond that, we just stood there. My bones began to thaw, and my mind, once racing in terror and fevered rage, was now feeling... pride? No.. it was something else, but a victorious emotion nonetheless I think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI somehow didn't notice it had reached out and gently gripped my arm, only becoming aware of it myself once it started to speak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I never.. meant to.. scare you..\" he said in this torn-up voice, struggling between shallow breaths \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm sorry.. this has to.. happen to.. you..\" it said\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts eyes welled up in pain while it clutched at the axe in the new laceration with its ragged hand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Please... kill... me...\" It wheezed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took the ax with its other hand and brought the blade to its neck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Kill me... candle... kill. NOW!\" The final word sounded like an explosion in my head as it put its hand on my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything went black for a fractured moment once I swung my axe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Kill it\" Was all I could think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swung with everything I had and hit something solid, metal? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was dead quiet, but I smelled a familiar mustiness that reminded me of high school. In an instant, my vision came rushing back, accompanied by an intense sense of vertigo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my mother's classroom. I looked to my left and saw her, and she saw me. I glanced over my shoulder, the entire class was staring at me. I looked back to my hands in reaction to the sudden attention, the strangeness of the situation momentarily lost on me. I then noticed that the axe was buried in the gas line, and an audible hiss was apparent in the silence. I looked back to me and upon her desk sat a single burning candle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Candle the candle the candle candle candle candle The Candle-- I let go of my axe without allowing time to think anymore, and sprinted towards the desk to blow it out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I was too late. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe classroom ignited; It shook the entire foundation... I was blown into the wall and fell limply behind a desk. My body was blackened from the blast, and my bones were broken, but I held on to my consciousness. I don't know how but I was moving toward my mom before I knew it. My mom just laid there torn to pieces but still alive. I crawled the best I could to her side... my body in shock. I reached for her hand but instead found the limb which was forcefully ripped from its host. She reached out her remaining and found mine, gripping it the best she could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Mom!\" I sobbed \n\n\"Mom... I'm sorry!\" I cried over her; \n\n\"I'm so sorry, Mom!\" \n\n\"I.. love you...\" She whispered, trying her best to smile until her grip lost its force and slipped away as gravity took a stronger hold on the now limp limb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI collapsed once more, resting my head on her searing shoulder. Flames lept forth from her burning clothes and scorched my eyes. I didn't care. \n\nI felt bile rising in my throat again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dragged myself away and to the corner of the room behind a desk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy arms at my side covered in my mom's blood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to touch anything... \n\nmy hands.. \n\nme. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI killed my mom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shook in the corner.. screaming in pain and sorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone spoke from behind me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"HEY' he yelled, \"We have to get out! There's a gas leak!\" and he grabbed my hand. I turned towards him and realized he was me.. and I.. I knew\n\nI had become the nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand he ran.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been several days since then. I write this with what little autonomy I have left. I beg you to please search for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSave me from me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel the grasp upon my self-control beginning to wither. This persistent and overwhelming compulsion to find \"me\", the me that isn't this wretch, is becoming all-consuming.. and I don't think I can hold myself back for another day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to break this cycle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe needs to reach the candle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis needs to be stopped.",

        "text": "Some background on the circumstances:\n\nI called in sick to work today. I had a bad headache last night that bled over into this morning. \n\nTo be honest, I was fine a couple of hours after I called in and could've gone, but I decided to stay home to sleep, read, make art and get stoned instead. Sue me.\n\nAnyway, that part is irrelevant.\n\nLet's bring us to about 3 hours ago, when I got the munchies and went into the kitchen for a snack.\n\nMy house is big and old, and sits on top of a small hill on the corner of two streets. I was snacking and watching any passing traffic out the window, also while observing the strange lack of snow for this time of year.\n\nI was jolted out of my hazy stupor when I thought I saw my boss's Corvette wiz by (at too fast a speed, might I add). The car had been going too quickly to really tell, and there are a lot of rich assholes around here with cars like that. So I brushed it off.\n\nA few moments later, I saw what looked like my manager Sarah's car drive by and turn onto the side street. \n\nNow, in a place where everyone lived near each other, or took similar traffic routes, I suppose this wouldn't be strange.\n\nBut I am the only person that works there and also lives where I do. I'm about 20 minutes out from my job, and live in the middle of podunk nowhere; the armpit of my county. Across the street from my house is literally a river. \n\nI stood by the window, mouth open in mid-crunch, and thought \"Wow. I guess I smoked too much.\"\n\nNeedless to say, all of that freaked me out quite a bit, so I retreated back into my bedroom to read and nap.\n\nI woke again just an hour ago, and went downstairs to my kitchen for more snacks after another smoke sesh.\n\nI was standing there by the window again, eating some chips for a little while before noticing a car drive past that looked like my co-worker Jeremy's new Ford Escape. I had seen it up close, so I was fairly certain. I thought I even made out the decal I know he has on the passenger side door. \n\nI started to freak out and seriously reconsider some of my life choices when the car drove by again, coming from the opposite direction. \n\nMy vision isn't the best, and the road is about 18 meters from the window, so I could've been mistaken... But I could SWEAR that I saw the driver turn their head completely sideways to stare at me as they drove past.\n\nTheir skin was definitely a dark complexion like Jeremy's... And it looked like he was smiling with wide eyes as he stared in. \n\nI'm super freaked out and don't know what to do. Does anyone out there have any advice?\n\nAm I going crazy? Please help! I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "One night, when he was drunker than usual, my father asked me why I was *‘so damn sad all the time.’* \n\nI didn’t have an answer for him then; I still don’t.\n\nMaybe something was twisted in me from the beginning. \n\nMaybe I was always destined to be like this. Maybe I was just one of God’s mistakes. \n\nIt was hard to keep those dark thoughts away when I looked around at the strangers on the subway.\n\nI could tell that most of them had careers, dreams for the future, and people who loved them.\n\nI had a dead-end job, no friends since High School, and no hope that things were ever going to get any better–but the worst part was that during my twenty years of life, no one had ever *once* touched me with desire or affection. My reflection in the black glass of the metro was a daily reminder of all the ways I’d failed. \n\nListening to depressing music on the metro ride from my dead-end warehouse job to my empty basement apartment: this was as good as it got, as good as it was ever going to be–\n\nOr so I thought, until the homeless woman dropped a lighter into my lap. \n\nI suppose she’d been trying to place it beside me, as she’d done for the other commuters. \n\n“I’ve got no home, no money, no family. For only fifty cents you can buy one of these lighters and help me eat today. Won’t you help a poor old woman?” She hobbled on a wooden stick, shaking her can of change and repeating her mantra as she walked. No one even looked at her, and I could see their point. The rattling of her can and her hoarse voice were grating, and besides, she was probably all going to spend it all on drugs later anyway. \n\nI didn’t exactly want her to touch me with her dirty, broken fingernails, so I held the lighter out to her–along with whatever change I had in my pocket. I’d grabbed it at random, but I blushed a little when I realized that I was only offering her four cents. \n\nWhen my coins disappeared into her can, she paused in front of me, leaning on her cane with a mad light in her intense hazel eyes. I fidgeted nervously and looked away. *Couldn’t she tell that I just wanted her to shut up and move on?*\n\n“You gave me something.” The beggar said with surprise. A snaggle-toothed smile crept across her face. “Now I’ll give you something in return. One wish. A reward–in proportion to your generosity*.”* The best way to deal with crazies on the metro, I’d learned, was *not* to engage with them. I kept my gaze fixed on some gum stuck to the filthy floor…but suddenly I felt those repulsive fingers squeezing my knee. “Go on,” the old woman insisted, *“make a wish.*” \n\nThe loudspeaker announced my stop. Trembling with disgust, I squirmed away from her and shuffled toward the battered subway doors with the rest of the crowd. When I looked back over my shoulder, she was still staring at me, her face a mask of disappointment. *One wish,* I thought. *That’s all. She’s just a crazy old woman, and she wants to feel like she’s granted your wish. What harm could it do?* \n\nI figured I might as well ask for something impossible.\n\n“How about *just one* girlfriend?” I shouted as the doors closed. “Wait–better yet–*make it two*!” The metro wagon sped away and I saw the beggar woman with head thrown back, her open mouth like a black pit as she laughed. \n\nAlthough it was the middle of summer, a shiver ran up my spine.\n\nWhen I got back to my dingy apartment, the neighbors were fighting again. I’d long since given up trying to intervene; from what I’d seen, they deserved each other. All I wanted was to collapse into bed with a bag of chips, doom-scroll mindlessly for a few hours, and fall asleep. \n\nThat was my plan, anyway–until I switched on a flickering light and saw the shape beneath my sheets. \n\n*The beggar woman,* was my first, terrified thought. *It had to be.* \n\nSomehow she’d beaten me home and broken into my apartment; where she was waiting in my bed like some sort of horrific mummy. The sheets rose and fell. \n\nWhatever was under there, it was *breathing.* \n\nWith my right hand, I grabbed the baseball bat that I’d kept by my bedside ever since the methheads down the hall had started trying my lock at night. With my left, I threw back the covers. \n\nThe completely nude girl stretched and batted her eyelashes at me. \n\n“Oh…*hey,*” she sighed. “I must’ve dozed off…”\n\nTo say she was beautiful would be an understatement; she was more like half of my fantasies all blended into one: she had the haircut of the emo girl I’d crushed on in high school, the smile of the friendly barista who I never had the guts to ask out, and–if I’m being honest–the body of my favorite porn star. She was perfect…but in that perfection, there was something more than a little unnerving. \n\nI dropped the bat. \n\n“You okay?” she cocked her head to one side with concern in a way that made me want to melt into the floor like microwaved butter. “Long day at work, huh? Don’t worry. Oan is getting dinner started.” That’s when I smelled it. Someone was putting my long-neglected oven to excellent use. “You didn’t have much in the kitchen,” the girl wrinkled her nose, “but you’d be amazed what Oan can do with just some old potatoes and cajun seasoning.” \n\n“Who…who are you?” I finally stammered. And then for the first time, I was being hugged with real affection. \n\n“I’m your girlfriend, silly,” she whispered breathily into my ear, then kissed it. “I’m *Tuo.”* I felt the warmth of her naked skin through my filthy work clothes.\n\nA shadow fell across the doorway.\n\n“Oh, is Tuo up?” a female voice asked. “Dinner’s ready.” \n\nIf *‘Tuo’* was half my fantasies made flesh, *‘Oan’* was the other half. *Two and One, One and Two,* I remembered what I’d said to the beggar in the metro and felt goosebumps break out on my arms. Tuo must’ve noticed my reaction, because she began massaging my shoulders from behind. She was good at it, too. Her hands were strong, surprisingly so–she probably could’ve snapped my neck if she’d really wanted to. \n\n“Let’s go!” she nuzzled against me. “We can’t let your food get cold! You’re gonna need a lot of energy for what we’ve got planned for you later!” \n\nThe contrast between the two beautiful girls and my filthy bachelor apartment made me wonder if I was going crazy. \n\nStill, *someone* had cooked the piping-hot, perfectly-seasoned roasted potatoes that I was shoveling into my mouth. The glass of water that Oan had brought me hadn’t just teleported to the table…\n\n*This was actually happening.* \n\nI was terrified of speaking, afraid that if I did it would break the spell and I’d wake up in my unmade bed, alone. But I had to know.\n\n“Are you two…real?” I finally asked. Oan and Tuo exchanged a glance, then laughed.\n\n“We’re *more real* than real!” \n\nI ignored the implications of what that might mean, just as I ignored how the girls sat as still as dolls until I spoke to them, their sultry eyes unblinking. When I’d finished my meal, they both sprung to their feet at once. While Tuo washed my plate, Oan grabbed my hand and led me to the bedroom. \n\nThe next few days passed in a blur. When I wasn’t sleeping with Oan and Tuo, I was fantasizing about it: at work, in line at the supermarket, on the dingy metro ride home. \n\nI was like a kid who’d never eaten sugar turned loose in a candy store. \n\nTheir warmth, the smoothness of their skin in the dark, the feeling of my own unsure fingers gripping Tuo’s long silky hair or Oan’s short, choppy pixie cut–it was all I could think about. I whistled on my way to work and tap-danced through the day, knowing what awaited me at home. \n\nThe metro ride began to feel eternal. I passed the endless minutes daydreaming about the disbelieving faces of my former bullies. Those insecure assholes had probably had their first time in the backseat of a car, finished in thirty seconds, and felt bad about it. They were probably stuck in loveless relationships with trashy girls who used them.\n\nMeanwhile, *I* got to share my home and my bed with Oan and Tuo. \n\nMy girls. My *reward*. Exactly what I deserved after a life that had been mostly miserable, unlucky, and pathetic. Their desires were my desires, and they only had eyes for me. \n\nFor weeks I did nothing but go to work, go home, and enjoy the company of my two beautiful, obedient, ‘*more-real-than-real’* girlfriends. \n\nThen one night I woke up at some ungodly hour and two pairs of eyes glowing in the dark.\n\nIt was Oan and Tuo. *They had been watching me while I slept.* \n\nI pretended not to notice, but as I slipped away to the bathroom, my mouth was bone-dry and my heart was thundering in my chest. In the pitch black bedroom, both of my girlfriends were making a throaty, reverberating sound that was somewhere between purring, growling, and laughter.\n\nBoth pairs of glowing eyes seemed to sneer at me as I staggered back to bed. I was too keyed-up to fall back asleep, and the creeping sensation on my skin let me know that they hadn’t stopped staring, not even for a moment. \n\nThe questions that I received when I came back to my apartment from work–or the grocery store, or even just from reading in the park–had seemed cute at first. \n\nNow they gave me goosebumps.\n\n*“Where were you, babe?”*\n\n*“You shouldn’t take so long to get home. Don't you know how much we miss you?”*\n\n*“What could you* possibly *have to do that’s more important than* us*?”*\n\nI realized that I was beginning to fear the girls, maybe even hate them a little bit. \n\nThe sound of their bare feet tiptoeing across the tile floor.\n\nThe lifeless stare of their glassy, doll-like eyes.\n\nI had always been a shut-in, but I started making excuses to avoid going home. I dreaded the sight of the sight of those impossibly-perfect beings waiting patiently on the other side of my apartment door. \n\nI wrote letters to people I hadn’t seen in years while I rode the metro, just so that I’d be forced to mail them. \n\nFor the first time, I joined my co-workers at the dive bar where they met after work. \n\nI went to the library, the movie theater, the gym. I walked in aimless circles until my feet dragged across the pavement and my eyes refused to stay open.\n\nOan and Tuo, it seemed, could tell that something was wrong–and their attempts to keep me with them became ever more desperate and unsettling. \n\nThe moment I walked in the door, Oan would take my jacket like a servant and Tuo would kiss my feet like a slave. \n\nThe apartment would be spotless, with my favorite meal waiting on the table; Oan and Tuo would press themselves against me–\n\nBut their skin felt cold.\n\nHow hadn’t I noticed it before? \n\nThe chalky, dead taste of their tongues. The unnatural sharpness of their nails and teeth. The way the fingers that caressed my back seemed far too long, almost as if they had an extra joint. \n\nI couldn’t pinpoint the specific moment that Oan and Tuo’s pleading turned to threats. \n\nSoon the way they pulled me toward the table, the couch, or the bed was no longer pouty and cute: it hurt. If I tried to stand up without their permission, those too-long fingers would creep across my thigh…\n\nAnd even though I’d started going to the gym…even though neither of them could’ve weighed more than a hundred and twenty pounds…\n\nTheir cold hands were inescapable. \n\nThings came to a boiling point one evening when Oan snuck up behind me to run her fingers through my hair while I was playing video games.\n\n“Urgh!” I jumped at the sudden touch. “LEAVE ME ALONE!” I roared, practically throwing the controller. The girls scattered like scared kittens…but when I’d pulled on my shoes, ready to storm angrily out the door, they were blocking my path. “Get out of my way.” I commanded. \n\n*“No.”* Oan and Tuo replied at once. There was a tiny, enigmatic smile on each of their perfect faces. “We were created for you–*a gift proportionate to your generosity.* We exist only for you. To satisfy your every desire. And that’s what we’re going to do–*whether you like it or not.”* \n\n“Look–just get out of here, the both of you.” I could feel myself shaking. I couldn’t believe I was doing this. “This was great at first, but now…it’s just not working. So why don’t y–”\n\nWith the strength of a professional wrestler, Oan tore me out of my gaming chair and pinned me against the wall with those many-jointed fingers. She licked my neck with her cold, slimy tongue. “*Do you think we have a* choice? *You think we WANT to be trapped in here, to be your  slaves? Do you have any idea of the agony that SHE makes us feel when you’re unsatisfied? Non-existence would be better than existing with YOU!”* Oan’s voice had changed; instead of sickly-sweet, it was gravelly, deep, and distorted. It sounded like an animal trying to imitate human speech. \n\n“So eat up, babe!” Oan grabbed a fistful of food from the plate on the table. “We made your favorite: chicken tenders with honey mustard! Mmm-mmm–*open wide!*” She pinched my nose shut to force my mouth open; when I resisted, she smeared the cold meat around my face and crammed it into my mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuo pulled down my pants and got to business. \n\n“This is what you wanted, right?” Oan hissed in my ear as I choked. “Two perfect girls, whose whole existence revolved around *you*? Well now you’ve got it, babe. Now you’ve got it…”\n\nI came back to consciousness slumped against the wall. My face and chest were sticky with sauce, and purple finger-shaped bruises had begun to appear on my wrists and neck. \n\nTuo softly sang one of my favorite songs with perfect pitch as she cleaned up the mess of my broken gaming chair. I felt Oan’s cold hands slide underneath my armpits and begin to drag me down the hall toward the bathroom. \n\n“Awake now, are we, babe?” Oan asked chipperly, as though she hadn’t nearly killed me only minutes before. “Then let's get you cleaned up…” \n\nI ran for the door. Oan and Tuo’s hysterical laughter followed me as I staggered down the hallway–filthy, pantsless, disoriented by terror. \n\nAnd that was how *SHE*  found me a few hours later: swaying down the sidewalk like a homeless drunk. The only thing that snapped me out of my daze was the tapping of her wooden cane and the jangling of her coin-filled tin.\n\n*The beggar woman from the metro.*\n\n\"You?!\" I nearly spat.\n\n“I’ve got no home, no money, no family. For only fifty cents you can buy one of these lighters and help me eat today. Won’t you help a poor old woman?” her words, so pathetic before, now sounded cruel and mocking. She recognized me, *I was sure of it.*\n\n\"I gave you four coins. You gave me a wish…\" I stammered.\n\n\"*A wish proportional to your generosity,\"* she corrected me through empty gums.\n\n\"What…what kind of *'generosity'* would I need to show to, uh, undo that wish?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's easy!\" she waved a gnarled hand. \"All of it.\"\n\n\"All of it?\" I wondered.\n\n\"Everything you have. Money. Phone. The apartment and everything in it. All of it.\" \n\n\"I guess that includes my soul and my firstborn too, right?\" I asked sarcastically, sickened by the thought of losing the little life I'd built, the one I'd undervalued for so long. The beggar woman didn't answer; she just raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What do *you* think?\" she sneered.\n\nI thought I’d had it rough before…but I’d *had no idea.*\n\nI’d had no idea of what having *nothing* was truly like. \n\nAfter the first night of sleeping under sheets of cardboard among some bushes in the park, my muscles ached from shivering. I spent as much time as possible in the library, sending out one job application after another and taking advantage of the free heat and bathrooms. It wasn’t long before the fluorescent hum, the glow of the monitor, and sheer boredom threatened to shred whatever sanity I still had left. \n\nEven after I’d spent the peak commuting hours begging for money, gone dumpster diving for food, and scouted out a place to sleep, there were still so many hours left in the day.\n\nHours left to sit with my thoughts and the stink of my own grimy, unwashed body. \n\nA sandwich-shop clerk who gave me a free meal at the end of that first, exhausting week gave me a warning along with my footlong: *“if you weren’t already crazy when you started living on the street, by the end of it, you will be. Get out as soon as you can.”*\n\nI’ll never forget the Indian exchange student who saw me panhandling outside a pizza parlor and got me access to his gym with a guest invitation. \n\nWhile I was using the machines and stretching–*just like everyone else, as if I didn’t sleep under cardboard in the park–*I felt like I could breathe for the first time since I’d become homeless. The hot shower felt like the most profound that life had to offer. \n\nOn my way out the door, the receptionist stopped me. \n\nNow that I was homeless, I felt guilty just for existing in a space sometimes, so I thought that I must be in some kind of trouble–until the receptionist handed me a plastic card. \n\nThe Indian grad student had bought me a full year membership.\n\nBefore I’d lost everything, I was focused on *my problems,* on what was wrong with *me.* On the streets, however, my focus shifted. \n\nWhat mattered was raiding the gourmet pizza chain’s garbage cans without getting caught.\n\nWhat mattered was keeping needles out of the arms of people I’d just met but come to care about–and many of those people were women. Not some two-dimensional fantasy, or some reward that I felt I was entitled to. Not a prize to be won or a symbol of success, but real breathing people with problems like mine. Slowly, I learned to forget the horror I’d left behind in my basement apartment, and the person I was when I’d wished for it. \n\nIt took eight months and a lot of help for me to get back into a place I could call my own, with work that paid the bills and food on the table. \n\nA place with no grinning doll-like faces waiting on the other side of the door.\n\nA place where no lithe nude shadows crept along the walls.\n\nA place where no one was bound or beholden to anyone else. \n\nAs far as I’m concerned, it's a reward…*proportional to my generosity.*    \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": " It was January 12, 1952. I was almost eighteen. I’m going to change the name of the town. The ocean always collects its debts. God help me. \n\nThe sun was swallowed up by the ocean and I could see the lights of Hadley Bay in the distance. The lighthouse on the point was barely cutting through the weather, and even the sound of the fog horn was muffled. It was raining hard and the waves were slamming into the beaches like they were running scared from something terrible out there coming up out of the deep. It was cold and me and the rest of the crew had just got done getting our boss’s boat ready for the first trip of the season. The guys I worked with weren’t the friendliest bunch of people. They were local and I wasn’t. I didn’t look like them either, which I’m sure didn’t help the gulf between us. But I had found this job and I intended to stick with it. I was from Chicago, and I wanted a new life on the west coast. Old man Gustuffson was kind enough to give me a job on his boat without any fishing experience to speak of. Probably because he could get away with paying me a lot less. \n\nI honestly hadn’t met a whole lot of friendly people in town. I’d only been working on the boat for a little over eight months. They’d started to treat me a little better on the boat, but that wasn’t saying much. The rest of the guys were going to go down to the bar and tie one on before we went fishing the next morning and I was not invited. So I found myself driving home and that’s when I’d seen Mose Bixby stumbling along the highway. Mose was the only local that had been friendly to me right off the bat. Maybe it’s because he was different too. Mose was what the locals referred to as the native halfbreed. That was what the polite ones called him anyway. I won’t bother to repeat the usual nickname I’d heard. \n\nNo one knew exactly how old Mose was, but he had always said he’d been in town longer than everyone else. I think that’s why most people spoke about him behind his back. He’d known and been friends with most of their grandparents and great-grandparents, and evidently had been quite the lively character back in the day. Back before he lost his family. Back before the booze had flooded his brains. \n\nDespite being told by most folks to keep him at an arm's length, I’d struck up a conversation with him one day shortly after I had got to town. Mose said a lot of things; he loved to talk, although it was almost always the alcohol doing the talking. He reminded me of my grandpa, but quite a bit older. Maybe that’s why I had a sweet spot for him. He’d go on about all kinds of crazy things that don’t seem quite so crazy to me anymore. \n\nI pulled up my truck next to him and leaned over my cracked seat and rolled down the window. That wind, man, it just tore into my face.\n\n“Mose! What the hell are you doin’ out here? Are you nuts?”\n\n“Billy?!” He steadied himself against the side of the truck and I can still see that toothy grin. God, I miss that man.\n\n“Get in here before you get swept out to sea you loony!” Mose jumped in real quick and shut and locked the door. He rolled up that window with a noticeable urgency. He was reeking of the booze, but his voice was low and serious. Kinda made me pause a bit before I started back down the road.\n\n“Billy…I was making my way to your place, but I had to come up here to do something first. I fell asleep and I didn’t think I was going to make it back in time. Glad for the rain and wind… lit a fire under my ass and woke me up.” He was fumbling into his ratty old peacoat looking for his cigarettes. I pushed in the lighter for him and pulled out the ashtray.\n\n“Thank you Billy.” I couldn’t help but watch him in the glow from the radio. He was shaking.\n\n“You cold Mose?”\n\n“No I ain’t. Drive Billy. Drive home.” His voice was bothering me, but I did as he said. I had to slow down because of the rain even though Mose was asking me to go faster. After he got a deep drag off of his smoke, he let it all out and sat there for a minute saying nothing. The only sound in the cab of my truck was the rain and my wiper blade that was trying to keep up. Those cigarettes of his, they were just about the worst thing I think I’d ever smelled up to that night.\n\n“I thought you said you was going out of town for a while.” He had an edge to his voice. Just like my grandpa.\n\n“I can’t right now.”\n\n“But you told me you would.”\n\n“I can’t Mose. I need the money, you know that.”\n\n“People make money other places, Billy.”\n\n“That’s true, but I’m starting to get my feet wet here.” At that he started laughing and choking on smoke. I could see his wide smile out of the corner of my eye. Some green slick of spittle was shining off the teeth he had left.\n\n“Getting your feet wet. Yeah. You can surely get your feet wet here.”\n\n“I think I like this kind of life. Get my own boat. I don’t think I ever want to leave the water.”\n\n“Ain’t nothing good out there.”\n\n“Says the man that’s stayed since Lincoln was in office.” He grunted a bit and then took another puff. \n\n“It’s my people’s land Billy. I’m the last one. Everyone else has done moved on. My momma’d come up and take me under herself if I ever left. Huh… yeah… yeah she would.” He chuckled again and shook his head.\n\n“You going to tell me what the hell you’re doing out here in this? You’re lucky you weren’t swept out. I swear I saw a swell almost reach the road.”\n\n“I told you I needed something. It can only be found up the creek.” He opened his coat and pulled out a mess of moss and sticks doubled over onto each other in a weird pattern and the whole thing was lashed together with some fresh bits of seaweed. It looked like four tuning forks making an x and a couple of thin wisps of weed making circles around it. “I figured you wasn’t going to listen to me. Why would you? I’m just a drunk old man. So I made this.”\n\n“Well, that’s…that’s really nice Mose.” He smiled at me and took another drag and blew it toward me.\n\n“No…it ain’t. It’s…what’s the word I’m looking for…it’s a necessary evil. I ain’t got time, we ain’t got time. I’ll have to tell you later. Just drive to your place. Mind if I bunk with you tonight?” I’d already let Mose stay over on a couple of occasions, and both times it took me a week to get the smell of his cigarettes out of my shack. But it was raining too hard for me to want to drive him up to his place. I figured the road had maybe washed out anyway.\n\n“I suppose that’s fine.”\n\nI lived in a little shack on The Row just outside of town proper. All the hired hands did. The shacks formed five cramped rows running parallel to the ocean. Maybe about seventy some odd shacks; I can’t recall exactly. Town was just under a mile away. The whole thing together wasn’t that big, nothing like it is now. Hadley’s Stone sat right out on the bay; a volcanic plug that was millions of years old. Huge sucker. Towered over the whole town. It always gave me the creeps.\n\nI had the shack on the end of the row, furthest from town, and the view from my little porch was nothing but sand and water and that huge stone covered in moss and birdshit. I parked and ran to my porch as fast as I could. I was going to be wet and cold for the next two weeks; I wanted to stay dry as much as I could before then. Mose ambled over to the porch, holding his cigarette close as to keep it dry. I let myself in, but Mose was looking at the front of the shack. \n\n“You coming inside or what? Close the door.”\n\n“Just give me a minute. You got a hammer?” I gave him the hammer out of my tool box and I watched him hang that thing he made from a nail just above my door. He took the hammer and bent the nail up on itself. “That ought to keep it there from the wind.” He ran to both the windows on the front of the shack and threw the shutters closed and latched them. He pushed down on the hooks as if he wanted to bury metal into metal. He took one last look at the front of my shack and then back out into the darkness of the ocean before he came inside.\n\nI started a small fire in the stove and I put some soup on. Mose took no time making himself comfortable. He’d already smoked two cigarettes by the time I got some supper. He refused to talk to me at all about whatever it was that had him worked up until we’d eaten and he had a snort. During that time I only heard the rain, the crackling of that nice fire, and that lonely fog horn out on the point. When he finally spoke, he opened the door of the stove and then just stared at that fire.\n\n“At some point tonight, a debt has to be paid. That debt is paid every hundred years. My mother’s people paid it a long time. They got this land, good land. In exchange, they offered up some of their own. Every hundred years. I’m sure it happens all over the world. I’m sure it happens every year. But this year is when our bill comes due. This land was taken by people who ain’t got a clue of what a real debt is, but they’re going to after tonight. I wanted you to leave but you're too damned stubborn, just as I knew you’d be, so I’m staying here. And that thing above your door. That stays there all night. No going back outside until morning. We got plenty of wood to keep that fire hot, plenty of drink to smack us stone drunk enough as to not hear anything that happens outside these walls. Have I made myself clear, Billy?”\n\nI didn’t know what to say. I was only eighteen and he had scared the living piss out of me. I nodded like an idiot and he nodded back. That was the end of talking. We kept on drinking, but I nursed my drinks to the point of pointlessness, and I had stayed awake and sober long after Mose had passed out on my bed. \n\nIt was around three in the morning when the rain stopped. All the other hands had stumbled back to their shacks over an hour before, and everything was quiet outside except for the foghorn. The water was quiet. I couldn’t sleep. After a while I grabbed one of his cigarettes and went to my door. I hesitated for a bit and then shook my head and stepped on my porch for a cigarette.\n\nMy eyes adjusted back to the darkness after I wiffed out the match and I just stood there on my porch, looking out towards the water. The lighthouse was giving me a view every few seconds. The waves had receded and the air outside was warm. Then a smell hit me, and I almost heaved up my guts. It was a sweet smell with a helping of rot. The light swept over the beach, and I saw a quick glimpse of something big down on the beach. From the smell of it, I figured something had washed up that had been dead for a while, but when the light swept across again, that big thing on the beach looked as if it had moved. I stepped off of the porch and focused my eyes at the darkness. I took a long drag off of that rancid cigarette, trying to sober myself out of whatever dream I was in and I waited for the light to sweep my direction. I heard thunder in the distance as I held all that nasty smoke in my lungs. When the light swept by again, that large thing on the beach was gone.\n\nThe hair on the back of my neck stood at attention and I exhaled. That smell was getting so strong that I was starting to taste it, completely obscuring the smell and taste of the cigarette. The air around me felt alive and I got the feeling that I needed to be anywhere but where I was. That thing that Mose had hung over my door was slapping against the shack in a small wind that had picked up, and I can say that somewhere deep down inside of my brain was yelling at me to get back inside my shack.\n\nI ran back inside and the door swung closed behind me. I ran over and I shook Mose hard. He wasn’t waking up. I figured I was just gonna have to heave him onto my shoulder and carry his ass to my truck. I was going to leave, but he was coming with me. I pushed him up to a sitting position and threw one of his arms around my shoulder, but that’s as far as I got. Something was on my porch.\n\nI looked at the latch on my door. I didn’t have a lock; just a hook that would set inside a metal eye on the jam. I quietly lowered Moses back down and crept toward the wood stove and grabbed my hatchet, which felt so small in my hand once I realized that noises weren’t just coming from the porch, but from everywhere outside. I took two more steps and turned the latch on my door. It wouldn’t keep anything from coming inside if it really wanted to, but it was the only thing I could think of to do. That’s when I heard them outside.\n\nGuttural barks and clicks. Some would call from the front of my shack and then others would answer from other directions. It was more than an animal sound; it was a language that spoke of something ancient and evil. \n\n“It's a terrible sound, ain’t it?” The volume of his voice shocked me, and I cried out in spite of myself. I wheeled around and Mose was sitting on the edge of my bed. I put my finger over my closed lips and Mose laughed. “They know we’re in here, it doesn’t matter how loud we are.” The language outside fell to a whisper, but it continued.\n\n“Hear them? They’re trying to be quiet now. Don’t want to spook the herd. It’s terrifying if you let yourself think about it. The thought of being slaughtered by a dumb animal is a terrible thing, but it’s nothing compared to the thought of being preyed on by something that’s smarter than you. Something far older than any man that’s walked the earth. I’ve never forgotten what they sound like. That’s the words of old things that decided to let our ancestors crawl out of the ocean and thrive. Cruel things that allowed us to live and herded us into certain spots all along the coasts. To the good grazing spots. Fatten us up.”\n\nEverything went quiet outside and my skin crawled at the terrible silence.\n\n“They’re getting ready. All hands on deck. They won’t start the culling until they’ve made sure nothing can get out.” I could hear whispers around my shack and I took a step away from the door. “See the ones around us, they know they can’t come in, but they’re going to make sure they’re ready in case we decide to come out.”\n\nThere was a mad barking from outside that almost sounded like a bunch of seals. It was coming from all over The Row. I could hear the angry grumblings of fishermen yelling as they got up and out of their shacks to investigate and then I heard the screaming. Some gunfire started outside further down The Row and all hell broke loose outside of my shack. Mose lit another cigarette and walked to the stove and held out his hands. I was shaking, but Mose was calm. I heard the men outside; some were begging for their lives, some were praying, while others were making a run for it. Mose gently took the hatchet out of my hand.\n\n“This isn’t going to help anything Billy. Just stay inside. I’ll keep the fire going.” I listened for a good hour while everyone in The Row was rounded up by the unseen things outside. The storm had come back in and the pounding of the rain had covered some of the pitiful cries outside. All the while, I swear I could hear things on my roof. I knew that things were waiting for us out there.\n\n“They’re almost done out there I should think. Just getting all the stragglers. By the morning, there’ll be nothing left. Town will wonder what happened, but pretty soon, Town will get hungry and it needs hired hands. Town will forget about all of us down here who just vanished like a fart in the wind, and life will go on, but there will be a feeling. Something they and their kids and grandkids will feel that will tell them it’s best to keep this place set aside for their debts. Only the lowly ones will live down here. And so it’ll be everywhere. I always wondered how many are taken on these nights all over this cursed world. I heard about a town ninety miles north where it happened thirty or so years ago. Happened south of us five years ago. In another hundred years, it’ll happen here all over again.”\n\n“How do you know all this? How do you know about that thing you made on the door? Why does it keep them out?” Mose walked over and unlatched the front door and threw it open. “What are you doing?!”\n\n“Settle down Billy, they aren’t coming in. That latch was for your own piece of mind and nothing more. Go on, look out there. Go on, it’s alright. People like me have more than a feeling. People like me know because they were the lucky ones who was spared. They understand that a debt has to be paid. That thing above your door is an agreement between them and the shepherds who are left behind to make sure the herd stays where they’re supposed to.”\n\nI stepped to the door. I could see nothing but darkness and the occasional sweep from the lighthouse. The deathly stench of the things was still strong through the rain.\n\n“My mother knew it… debts… sometimes you have to pay whether you like it or not. You know how old I am Billy? Almost ten over a hundred. Almost ten when my mother made one of those things that’s hanging over your door now. She showed me how. To pass on the role she had found herself in. I never forgot. A hundred years tonight. I know she loved me. I know she was supposed to be the one, but when it comes down to it, she got scared.” The energy changed inside my shack. It was full of anxiety and anticipation. I turned to Mose. He was standing right behind me, holding my hatchet. “It’s one of those things Billy. You understand your role, but you get cold feet. My mother came at me with panic in her eyes. She couldn’t do it, so she grabbed me. I was no longer her son, you see? I had become the debt. but before I was thrown out, she tripped. I didn’t push her. She tripped, and I watched her fall out the door. And I watched, and I watched, and I watched. And all these years I’ve understood. I’m old. The debt should be mine, but I ain’t brave enough, and I’m not going that way.”\n\nHe stepped toward me and raised the hatchet.\n\n“Mose.”\n\n“I’m sorry Billy.” He lunged at me and swiped down with the hatchet. He was fast. Too fast for someone his age. The hatchet glanced off my thigh. He grabbed a hold of me and tried to push me out of the door. He was about as strong as anyone that I’d ever tussled with who was my own age. He kept apologizing while he was inching me closer and closer out of the door. I was finally able to overpower him and spin him around. His back was now to the open door. I can’t say that I wanted to push him out, but I felt that I had to. \n\nHe rolled over a few times in the wet sand until he was able to get back to his feet. I backed away from the open door. He ran at me like a wild man and I closed the door and pushed the latch. Mose was trying to pull it open, but I was pushing it closed. There was a chorus of that mad barking all around my shack. Mose was begging for me to open the door, and then they took him. I listened to his fingernails scraping and breaking all the way down my porch as the things dragged him away and down to the ocean. He was screaming the whole way, begging for help from a God and a friend, neither of which was willing to give him any. I just stood there with all my weight against my door until at long last, I couldn’t hear Mose anymore.\n\nI wrapped my wound and sat on my bed until the morning. After the light had come, I ventured outside and I grabbed the thing off of my door that Mose had made. I carried it around with me as if it was an amulet that might keep me safe in case any more of those things were still around. The rain had lightened as I walked down The Row. Some of the shacks had been partially burned and all the doors were open. Seventy some odd empty shacks. Broken glass and guns and all manner of things that were used as weapons were littered on the ground throughout, but there was not a single person left dead or alive in The Row.\n\nI walked down to the beach, but there was nothing but a faint stench on the wind that spoke of what happened just a few hours before. Mose had predicted the exact path of denial that everyone in town took towards what happened that night, and I didn’t feel the need to enlighten any of them. I had been taken at my word that I had been down and out with the whiskey flu and had no story to tell. After all this time, I've questioned myself about it all. The only thing that keeps me from dismissing it altogether is the scar on my right thigh. I’ve never told anyone this story. I’m not long for this world, and I suppose this is the way I try to make it right with God. Maybe some of you will take me seriously. The ocean, and all the foul things in it, are owed a debt. Unfortunately, most of us lowly ones end up footing the bill. \n\nI moved up from The Row a long time ago, but I can still see where it used to be from my front yard. I made a name for myself and I’m respected in this town now. People have no idea how old I am, but they joke about it. They have no idea I’ll live long past them. I have something inside my head that keeps me from moving on from this place. Something evolution put deep in my brain and those things triggered. I wonder if, when the night comes, I’ll be able to walk out into the night and pay the debt, or if I’ll do what’s been done twice before. My great grandson will be almost thirty years old when the bill is due, and I'll pass the debt to him.",

        "text": "It was around 10 pm. I was going to brush my teeth in the bathroom right outside my bedroom. Everything felt kinda off that day but I just ignored it. Earlier I heard something moving under my bed and I was hearing my mom calling my name from downstairs but she said she never called for me. I know what was underneath my bed wasn’t my dog, Oswald, because he isn’t allowed in my room and my door was closed. So anyway when I went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror above the sink, and felt something under my foot. You know that feeling of when you step on someone’s hand and they pull away? Yeah, so that’s what I felt. I looked down and nothing was there but my foot was wet all of a sudden. I nearly jumped out of my skin when something started shaking the glass shower doors. Me and my siblings always have paranormal experiences and we make jokes but this experience genuinely made me scared of going to that bathroom and every time I go in I always look at my feet when I stand by that sink.\n\nLater that night I kept getting the feeling that I was being watched. The house was making noises but I thought it was just because it’s old, then around 2 AM my door nob started rattling for about 30 seconds and I was shaking, I almost screamed when I felt a hand on the back of my neck, it was cold and it felt like the fingers were long and frail. Me and my sister shared a room at this time and I was always having sleep paralysis but I know for a fact that wasn’t what it was. When I did fall asleep I actually had sleep paralysis and all that happened was I saw an old woman and a child at the end of my bed staring at me. The scariest part is the I had the top bunk and I found out the next morning that my grandma had passed away in the middle of the night. The woman I saw resembled her but she looked odd, not like ugly odd but like inhuman odd. She had a smile going from ear to ear and her eyes looked like they were about to fall out of her head. I don’t know who the child was but they had hair to their shoulders and had a hospital gown on with the same smile but they looked like they were in pain and it was hurting them to smile.\n\nMy friends say that it was my grandmother saying goodbye but I don’t think that was her. It was almost like someone or something was wearing her skin. I had problems with sleeping for awhile but I have gotten better. I have had more experiences but none have compared to that one.\n\nAlso sorry if that was confusing I’m not very good at telling stories.",

        "text": "(I got the following story from a video my missing friend, Nate Fredrickson, recorded. I don't know if he told the truth here. The family has talked to the neighbor and she claims she didn't talk to him that day.\n\nI've decided to post my transcription of the video online to see if anyone can help with the search. If any of the people reading this notice anything strange in what Nate said or have any other information, please let me know.) \n\nNate: I'm making this recording so that my friends and family members know what happened to me. I admit, after I did what I did, I at least deserved a good scare from my neighbor. However, I DON'T deserve what I believe will happen soon. \n\nI've tried pleading, reasoning, and screaming my apologies to my neighbor and I've gotten no response except the sounds of things breaking on the first floor of my home. I assume there's a search going on. Perhaps my neighbor only feels wrathful at this point. If so, this won't stop until I'm found. When that happens, I may die. \n\nIf my neighbor didn't have that garden of showerheads, maybe I would've avoided all this. To clarify, when I use the term \"showerheads\", I'm not talking about a flower breed. My neighbor has literal showerheads, like the kind you find in a shower, all over her front and back yards. Somehow and for some reason, she found dozens of these, painted them in different colors, stuck fake leaves to them, and stuck them in her garden beds. \n\nMost of my neighbors found this art project bizarre but harmless. I agreed with them. Ask them and they'll tell you as much. I didn't mean what I said at all. \n\nYesterday had just, well, got me right in the ass, to put it bluntly. I had to go to the vet to put my dog, Skipper, down. I felt like absolute garbage last night and couldn't get to sleep. Today, I wanted to do nothing but bum out, play video games, and eat delivery pizza. However, I must have stepped on a Bible or something, because God decided to send my neighbor over. \n\nA few minutes after I demolished the King of One Thousand Swords boss, she rang the bell. I would have ignored it, but I had already ordered the pizza. \n\nSo now on top of my raging grief, I also had the mild disappointment of seeing my neighbor standing there instead of the pizza delivery guy. She had a nice smile that shone through her wrinkles and wore a cute flowery blouse, but that didn't help my mood. Still, I managed to talk politely when I asked her what she wanted. \n\nShe told me what happened last night first. A windstorm had come by last night while I was emotionally preoccupied. The wind had caused some of her showerheads to fall over. She had gone to pick them up, but her arthritis-ridden back refused to let her bend over that day. She believed that the \"nice young man\" next door could help her pick them back up. I would even get paid twenty dollars for that small task.\n\nIt would have taken me ten minutes, but I just couldn't do anything that day. Yet, I didn't want to seem like an asshole. I think this inner conflict sent my emotions over the edge and I said what I shouldn't have said. \n\n\"Why would I want to help you with your stupid art project?\" \n\nI regretted the words immediately after they came out of my mouth. My neighbor's expression stretched with shock and then it scrunched up with anger. My already tense muscles became tenser. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"Yesterday was difficult. My dog died and…\"\n\n\"Oh, so that gives you the right to be an asshole to everyone,\" my neighbor snapped. \n\n\"Well, yanno, I'm grieving right now. I can't control myself all that well. Surely you can understand…\" \n\n\"Clearly!\" \n\nShe grabbed the knob and slammed the door in my face. I stood there for a few moments. Then I turned around, trudged back toward my couch, picked the controller up, and sat down. Only then did I realize I had lost the urge to play video games. I just wanted to sleep. \n\nI set the controller down on the coffee table, didn't bother to turn the game off, and let myself fall onto the couch cushion. A few moments after I pulled my legs up and stretched them out, I fell asleep. \n\nThwack! Thwack! \n\nI awoke to these sounds at my window. I lifted my head until I could see it. A single pink showerhead covered in fake leaves floated there on the other side of the glass. I started chuckling. I stopped when I realized who could be under that showerhead and what she probably wanted. \n\n\"Is that you, Ms…Ms…\" I had forgotten my neighbor's name. \"Um, is that you Ms. Neighbor? There's, uh, no need for violence. I meant what I said. About what I said, I mean. I mean, my apology was sincere.\" \n\nI rolled off the sofa and planted my feet on the ground. I crept over to the window as my neighbor continued to bang the showerhead against the window. The glass refused to break. I smirked and relaxed a little. \n\n\"You probably won't break that. That window has tempered glass on it. It's also double-paned.\" I stopped about a foot away from the window. \"Look, just put that thing away, Ms. Neighbor. Let's talk about this like reasonable people.\" \n\nThe showerhead stopped moving for a few moments. Then it began shaking. \n\n\"Oh…you…you don't need to feel afraid.\" I leaned over the window sill so I could look into my neighbor's eyes. \"I just want to–\" \n\nA long pink tube sat by itself on the ground. It shook at the same rate as that pink showerhead. With my eyes, I followed the tube back up to the showerhead. I gasped. The metal on the showerhead had started to budge in places. These bulges moved chaotically. I froze, feeling both fascinated and terrified by the sight. \n\nIn no time at all, the bulges split open and more showerheads, complete with fake leaves, emerged. These then became nearly twice the size of the original showerhead in just a few moments. \n\nAfter about a dozen showerheads emerged and grew, the glass smacking continued with more force. This entire showerhead tree threw itself against the glass with shocking speed and strength. The frame shook. I broke out of my shock and backed up before turning around and sprinting up the stairs. The moment I slammed the bedroom door, I heard the glass shatter below. \n\nSo that's what happened and why I'm here. I said something bad to my neighbor and, even though I apologized, she…uh…sent this showerhead monster after me. Heh. It's kinda funny, in a way. I would be laughing if I wasn't so terrified. \n\n…\n…\n…\n\nI love you all and I'm sorry that I put you through this. I won't make you watch what's gonna happen next.\n\n(A week has passed and we've yet to find Nate. I want to believe he just decided to go away for some time, but I don't think that's the case. We will continue trying. Thanks in advance to anyone who tries to help.)",

        "text": "I'm not sure if this is happening outside my county (Adams, OH), or if I am hallucinating because I haven't heard anything from anyone regarding the latest EAS announcement that went off on my TV just this morning.  The alert read simply:\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.\"\n\nOnly on my TV; no other devices have been affected, most likely because the satellite for my TV  and my landline are the only things I have that have any connection at all to the government. I've been an engineer for 5 years now, off-grid for 3, but I couldn't figure those out by myself. \n\nI'm sorry if this story doesn't come out right. Lord knows I've never been an author. \n\nAnyway, I figured there must be some sort of glitch in the system or a hacker. So I called my mom. She doesn't do well with situations like this (if there's any other situation that can be compared to this one), so I wanted to check in on her, or even just to calm myself down in the process. But it was down. Even after covering my ears to listen closely after re-dialing, because the EAS alarms were still going off, it was just a dial tone.\n\nAt some point, enough was enough. That noise is just so grating, and it was designed to cause panic. But my TV wouldn't turn off. Even after I smacked the remote on the table and pressed the button on it manually. All I was faced with was loud, blaring, screeches and, \"THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.\"\n\nSo I try calling the police, but naturally, the landline wasn't working at all. Even though I called my mom just last night and it was working fine. There's still some hope that maybe this county is just run by fools who don't know how technology works. It was a feasible explanation; it's a small county. We probably don't have access to all that fancy federal stuff. But even that wouldn't explain why nobody else is here.\n\nBecause after I gave up calling the police, I got my gun and went out. Figured I would help some people, cause worse case scenario, this could be some sort of terrorist situation. But it's beyond. I don't know if terrorism is the right word for it. I don't want to say supernatural. I believe in science and technology and logic. I don't want it to be supernatural. But I don't know any other word for it.\n\nBecause everyone is gone. I went inside my nearest neighbors' houses (the crime rate here is too low for anybody to bother locking their doors), and it was all empty. Empty and orderly, too. No signs of struggle, no blood, no corpses, absolutely nothing.\n\nNo traffic, either, as I drove my way here to the public library. No librarians. I strolled right in. I searched for any other signs of humans before I went out to the car for extra rounds and locked the doors behind me. For whatever reason, whatever terrorist is here, was not entirely thorough with cutting us off. There is still wifi here. Probably assumed they had done a thorough sweep of the place, hopefully they don't know I'm here. I'm not fond of social medias like this. I know my grandson enjoys this website, and I know millions of others do, too. \n\nSo I need to know that I'm not alone. I need to ask if anyone knows anything about this, maybe some government officials, maybe FBI, and if I can do anything at all. I will stay here at the library, and pray they don't find me here.",

        "text": "The following is an old folk tale from Salem Massachusetts:\n\n\n\nThe pastor, a man of God, sat alone in his dimly lit study. He had always feared that he was not a true Christian, that his faith was weak and he would be damned for eternity. But now, as he sat staring at the pages of his Bible, his fear had taken on a physical form. It appeared to him as a monstrous creature, with the head of an alligator for one hand and a stag beetle for the other. He had named it Gurial, a creature born from his fear and self-doubt.\n\nThe pastor had always been skeptical of the witch trials that had plagued Salem, but now he couldn't shake off the feeling that he too was being judged by a higher power. His nights were plagued by nightmares of Gurial, who would appear to him in his dreams, taunting him with its grotesque features.\n\nHe knew that he had to confront his fear, but he didn't know how. He prayed for guidance, but the only answer that came was the sound of Gurial's taunting laughter.\n\nOne night, as he lay awake in bed, the pastor made a decision. He would journey to the heart of the witch trials, to the very place where the accusations and executions had occurred. He would confront his fear head on, and prove to himself that he was a true Christian.\n\nThe pastor set out early the next morning, traveling to Salem. As he walked the streets, he felt the eyes of the townspeople upon him, judging him as they had judged the accused witches. But he pushed on, determined to face his fear.\n\nAs he stood at the site of the trials, he closed his eyes and prayed for strength. And when he opened them, Gurial was there, staring back at him with its grotesque alligator and stag beetle heads.\n\nBut this time, the pastor was not afraid. He stood tall and spoke with conviction, \"I am a man of God, and I will not be judged by you or by any other creature. My faith is strong, and I will not be swayed by fear.\"\n\nWith that, Gurial let out a deafening roar and vanished into thin air. The pastor knew that his fear had been conquered, but little did he know, the creature was far from gone.\n\nFrom that day forward, the pastor lived his life without fear and doubt, but strange occurrences began to happen in his church. Objects would move on their own, and the pastor would hear strange noises coming from the dark corners of the church. But every time he went to investigate, he found nothing.\n\nThe townspeople of Salem looked upon him with newfound respect and admiration, knowing that he had faced his fear and emerged victorious. But little did they know, the pastor had only made a deal with the creature, trading his soul for a false sense of peace. And from then on, Gurial haunted the church, preying on the weaknesses and fears of those who entered. Beware, for the creature is still out there, waiting for its next victim to make a deal with the devil.",

        "text": "The darkness had settled in so quickly that it almost took me by surprise. As I walked home from work, I could feel a sense of dread rising in me. I had been out late the night before and had hoped that the sun would provide some solace. But despite the bright sky, the shadows seemed to linger and my fears began to take shape.\n\nThe trees around me swayed in the wind, their branches reaching out to me as if they were beckoning me to stay. I felt a chill as the leaves brushed against my skin and I quickened my pace. I felt like I was being watched and I knew that something was out there waiting for me. \n\nI felt in my pocket for my keys, clutching them tightly in my hand. I was almost home. I could see the streetlight in the distance, shining its golden light down the street. I let out a deep breath as I started to make my way towards it.\n\nBut then, I heard it. A low growl coming from the bushes. I could feel my heart racing, as I fought the urge to run. I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement.\n\nAnd then I saw it. A large wolf, its eyes glowing in the night. I sucked in my breath, frozen in fear. The animal seemed to be just as surprised to see me as I was to see it.\n\nIt slowly took a step towards me, its lips peeled back in a fierce snarl. I could see the saliva dripping from its fangs and I felt my body go cold. It was then that I knew I had to act. \n\nI slowly put my hand in my pocket and slowly pulled out the pocket knife that I always kept with me. I slowly opened it and pointed it at the wolf. To my surprise, the creature did not move. \n\nIt just stood there, watching me with its cold, calculating eyes. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, my mind racing and my hands trembling. I knew that I had to do something, but what? \n\nI felt a sudden urge to run, but I knew that would only make the situation worse. I had to stay and face the beast. I tightened my grip on the knife and slowly stepped forward. \n\nThe wolf seemed to sense my determination and it slowly took a step back. I could feel my courage growing, but I steeled myself for whatever might come. I took another step forward and the wolf retreated a few more steps.\n\nI kept advancing, and the wolf kept retreating until we were almost at the streetlight. The creature stopped and stood its ground, its eyes never leaving me. I could feel the tension in the air as we faced each other in the half-light, both of us unsure of what would happen next. \n\nI kept the knife pointed at the wolf, my grip only slightly loosening. I knew that if I made a wrong move, I could end up in trouble. And then, in the distance, I heard a sound. \n\nIt was a sound that I had heard before. It was the sound of a dog barking. As the sound grew louder, the wolf seemed to shrink in size, its snarls fading away. I kept the knife pointed at it as I heard the sound come closer and closer. \n\nAnd then, a man appeared in the light. He was an older man, his hair graying and his face weathered by time. He was carrying a large stick and a small dog at his side. \n\nHe looked at me with understanding eyes and said, \"It's okay, I'm here now.\" I slowly lowered the knife, my hands shaking as the man approached me. \n\nHe looked me up and down, his gaze lingering on the knife in my hand. He shook his head before turning to the wolf, holding out his hand and murmuring words that I could not understand. \n\nThe wolf cowed and cowered before him, its head bowed in submission. The man turned back to me and said, \"It's alright. He won't hurt you now. He was just scared.\" \n\nI felt a wave of relief wash over me, and I slowly nodded my head in appreciation. I put the knife away and thanked the man before continuing on my way home. \n\nAs I walked, I wondered what had just happened. I had been so sure that there was danger, but it had all just been in my head. It was a reminder of how unpredictable life can be. \n\nBut despite the unsettling feeling that had been looming over me, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of peace. I had faced my fears and come out the other side unscathed. And I knew that no matter what else might come my way, I would be ready.",

My mother sat beside him. “A new life, leaving that old town behind. You’ll have tons of new friends, a new school…”\n\n“Yeah, I know,” I responded. To be honest, I was more stressed than excited. I was happy to leave everything behind. The school, the bullies, and the shit weather, but at the same time, it was a big change. I spent my whole life there. \n\n“Don’t worry, Tom, it’ll be great,” my mother smiled at me. \n\n“Yeah,” my father agreed. “But before we arrive there, we have to find a gas station.”\n\n“Where are we right now?” I asked. I tried to look for some signs from the window, but I couldn’t see anything because of the snow.\n\n“Near Harwich,” mother replied. \n\n“Never heard of it.”\n\n“It’s just some small town, nothing significant. It’s really old, and I think it’s full of criminals. I don’t think we should stay here for too long, to be honest.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” father said. “Just five minutes, and we’re going. If the GPS is right, there’s a gas station just around the corner.”\n\nHe parked the car there, then looked at me. \n\n“Wanna come?”\n\n“Yeah, I think I’ll buy a bag of chips for the road.”\n\n“I’ll check out the store, too,” mother replied.\n\nAs we were approaching the store, we saw a homeless old man sitting near a bench, drinking some rum.\n\n“Watch out, this place is full of murderers, hah,” he laughed. “You wouldn’t want these Supreme God idiots to kill you.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I asked.\n\n“Don’t worry, Tom, just a drunk homeless man,” my mother dragged me away.\n\n“Yeah, of course,” the old man sighed. “Don’t listen to the drunk, homeless man, kid. But remember me if you’re dead. I warned you.”\n\nWe reached the store. The door creaked as I opened it, and a musty smell hit me as I stepped inside. The store was dimly lit, with rows of dusty shelves and an old, dirty counter. Behind the counter, there was a man the cashier, a blonde guy in his 30s. He looked awfully skinny, I could see the shape of his skull. He was also pale, I think he looked sick.\n\n“Good evening,” I greeted him.\n\n“Evening,” he glanced at me for a second, then looked back at his phone. What a rude person, I thought.\n\nI noticed cobwebs on the corners of the room, and the floors were creaky beneath my feet. Some windows were boarded up, which made the store feel even more claustrophobic. The neon \"open\" sign flickered dimly, adding to the eerie atmosphere. It was clear that the store hadn't been well-maintained in quite some time. The feeling of being watched was overwhelming and made the experience of being in the store even more unsettling.\n\nAs I walked deeper into the store, I noticed that the aisles were cluttered with a variety of items, some of which seemed to have been there for a very long time. The products looked like they had been forgotten, and their packaging was discolored and worn. The air felt thick and heavy.\n\nThe lighting in the store was poor, and I had to squint to make out the labels on the products. The walls were lined with grimy posters and signs that had become faded with age. I saw a corner of the store that was blocked off by a tattered curtain, I couldn't help but wonder what was behind it, but I didn't dare to investigate.\n\nMy mother walked behind me, and placed her hand on my shoulder, leaning closer to me.\n\n“Do you see that guy, there?” she whispered. “I don’t know what or who is it, but it’s freaking me out.”\n\nI looked out of the window, and at first, I couldn’t see anything in the dark parking lot, but soon I saw what she was talking about. Near an old car, there was a tall figure wearing a strange, black robe with a large hood. The creepiest thing was his mask, or at least I hoped it was just a mask, and not a real moose skull. It had large horns, my blood froze as I saw the guy.\n\nMy dad came inside too, walking to the cashier to pay for the fuel. When he was done, he came to us.\n\n“So, are you ready? Can we go?”\n\n“Do you see it?” mother asked him. In a few seconds, my dad saw it too. \n\n“What the fucking hell?” he whispered slowly. “Okay, it was enough of this town, let’s just leave.”\n\nWe nodded, following him out of the store. I was glad we could finally leave this gas\n\nstation behind. As we approached our car, however, I had a strange feeling. I felt like someone was watching me. And it wasn’t the creepy guy in the moose mask near the other car. \n\nMy dad opened the car door, then immediately jumped back. At first, I didn’t know why he did that, but then I saw another tall figure in a robe getting out of our car, rising above my dad. The guy had a human skull mask on his head. I don’t know if he was the scarier one, or the one with the moose skull. \n\n“What are you doing in our car!?” my father shouted at him. “Who the fuck are you?”\n\nAs we looked around, we could see even more hooded figures around the gas station. We were surrounded. As we came to this realization, I think we all started to think about what to do next. Maybe we could jump into the car fast enough, then drive out of there. But we couldn’t do that, as the hooded guy was still standing between my father and our car.\n\n“Run back to the store,” father shouted, and we all started running at the same time as fast as we could. When all three of us entered the building, we looked back. The hooded guys weren’t following us. They were just standing there. At least twenty of them.\n\nThe cashier walked to us. We hadn’t noticed this when it happened, but now, looking back, I remember him being in a dark robe.\n\n“Please, sir, call the police,” my mother said to him. “Who are they?” \n\n“Sacrifices need to be made to the Supreme God,” the cashier said, then put a horse skull on his head, wearing it as a mask. He then raised his hood.\n\n“What the - ” my father couldn’t finish this sentence, as the cashier cut his throat with a quick swing of a knife. My father looked at him and then at us with wide us, not understanding what had happened, unable to talk. I could never forget that expression. He looked at us for a few seconds, but it felt like hours went by. He then collapsed to the ground, a blood puddle started to form around him.\n\nMy mother screamed at the top of her lungs. I just couldn’t react, I was unable to comprehend the events of that night. It was like a nightmare. I hoped I could wake up right at that minute. \n\nAs I looked out the windows, I could see the other hooded figures had started approaching the store. Then they came inside. One of them grabbed me, another one grabbed my mother.\n\nThe cashier with the horse skull raised his knife, then pointed it right at my mother. \n\n“Tom, look at me,” my mother said, crying. “You know I love you, right?”\n\nAs soon as she said this, the cashier guy stabbed that fucking knife in his throat, killing her in just a few seconds.\n\n“May the Supreme God take care of you in the afterlife,” they all said at the same time. He then pointed the knife at me.\n\n“Wait,” I shouted. My survivor instincts kicked in. I couldn’t even cry, as I was still in shock. I lost both my parents. Just because we didn’t have enough fuel. “Who is the Supreme God? I want to learn about him. I want to join you!”\n\nThey stopped. There was about half a minute of silence. The one with the horse skull looked around, some others were nodding toward him. He then looked at me.\n\n“The Supreme God is welcoming everyone who has an open mind.”\n\nNow I’m trapped with them. A fucking cult. A bunch of fucking murderers, and I have to pretend to be a part of it. I have to pretend that I don’t care about the death of my parents. Please, if someone near Harwich is reading this, call the police. I don’t know exactly where I am. I think they want to do some ritual to make me a part of their cult.

        "text": "My name's Frank, I'm a custodian of types for the local mortuary. It wasn't a practice made by experience or one from abundant options. I had wandered into the small town of Achnought in June. A traveler I was, wandering at that, wondering where my next meal would come from. And it just so happens that life events or therein end of, was a good place as any to grab a free meal. Though I did prefer weddings over funerals.\n\nBut as the old saying goes, beggars can't be choosers, and I had arrived as they were discussing how to bury the body of Matthew Pernickle. An accountant, a banker? I'm not sure. What I did think though, was how odd they were in describing what ought to be done. As if none of thems ever buried one in or dug one out. They were all townsmen; local, burly, fatherly; and not one had a child who needed to give a proper resting place for a beloved dog or a cold dead hamster? Suspicious, I would have been. Yes. Though susceptible to the hat being passed around, of bills, big bills going down the upturned throat of the mad hat wrought the thought straight out of my head.\n\n\"What's the hat for,\" I asked a man dressed in a black suit.\n\n\"To bury the deceased.\" He paused. \"Did you know him?\"\n\nI shrugged, \"Hardly. Though we've spoken a few words between aisles in town.\" I added, \"Stout man.\"\n\nThe man nodded, \"I didn't know him well either. And he was married to my cousin. Always the stoic, Matty was.\"\n\nI agreed, \"Yeah he gave off that impression, old Matty did.\" I scratched at my neck, \"So whoever buries the man, poor Matty, gets to keep the collection?\"\n\nThe man in the black suit could have chuckled, though stifled it as they were in mourning, \"That was the deal struck with the last groundskeeper, were it not?\"\n\n\"Always,\" I commented. \"Always.\"\n\n\"Say,\" he swallowed. \"I don't think we've ever met.\" He took out his hand, \"Paul McConnell.\"\n\nI shook it to bees, \"Frank. And it's a pleasure in finally meeting you. Though under better circumstances one could have wished.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" He paused again, his attention drawn to the whispering men standing next to the casket, and sighed. \"I suppose we'll have to draw straws again.\" Paul took off his hat and beckoned me forward, \"Come on, before we're stuck here until midnight.\"\n\n\"Straws?\"\n\n\"On who will bury Matty of course.\"\n\n\"Right. Straws. Of course.\" I caught up to him, \"Hold on just a minute. What if there were a volunteer?\"\n\nThis time Paul did laugh, it should have served as a warning, but my last looks had seen the tall hat brimming with green, and couldn't be bothered.\n\n\"Who would,\" he sputtered between laughs, \"do something so stupid?\"\n\nThe cast of eyes drew in our direction. They did not seem pleased at our missing glum.\n\n\"What's the commotion Paul,\" a tall burly man questioned.\n\n\"Mayor Hannon, I apologize.\" Paul whispered to me, \"My great Uncle.\" Before turning back to the men surrounding the casket, \"We were discussing. What? In the event of a volunteer.\"\n\nSeveral of the men let a smile creep across their face, a few even chuckled. The Mayor was not wavered by either, \"A volunteer?\"\n\nThe way that man looked in my direction, veiled the others in silence. It were almost as if the rest of them took a step back. His glare and patience forced me to feel uncomfortable enough to speak, \"I. Yes. It was me who volunteered to bury poor Matty.\"\n\n\"Do you mean it,\" a young man exclaimed.\n\nOne of the men ribbed the lad with his elbow. And the Mayor, never having taken his eyes off of me, tested my resolve, \"You've experience in excavation?\"\n\nI liked to brag, \"I did a stint of mining up north some years ago. Deep, big holes that made a man question the omniscience of God within the pits.\"\n\n\"Big ones,\" the Mayor asked.\n\n\"Oh yeah, giant holes, near straight to the center of the Earth.\"\n\nA smile spread across his thin lips, and I saw a greedy look appear in his eyes. I've only seen men look at two things that way, and one was gold, the other food. He snatched the hat roughly, I watched as two bills floated out and landed upon the soft ground. \"Will this suffice for your services, mister...?\"\n\n\"Frank. My friends call me Frank.\" I grabbed the hat and swooped down for the fallen bills. There must have been near a thousand dollars. \"No splitting the fee,\" I asked.\n\n\"No, no. It's all yours. Though some of us will have to stay and watch. Make sure you've done a proper job.\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders, \"It's all the same to me.\" I looked at the others, \"You could all stay, if you'd like. Won't change the work,\" I chortled.\n\nMy words rang like buckshot, reminding birds ' freedom. The few, few flew, floop, floop. Leaving only myself, the Mayor and the Priest on that plot.\n\n\"Paul,\" the Mayor shouted.\n\n\"Yes Uncle,\" the heavyset man turned reluctantly from his flee.\n\n\"Git over here boy.\"\n\nI could see Paul's lower lip start to tremble, but ultimately he silently agreed, and came to stand; albeit behind his uncle the Mayor, and the Priest.\n\n\"Let's get started,\" the Mayor demands.\n\nThe Priest began the last rites or some passage from the Bible, and I pulled the suspenders from my shoulders and spit in either palm as I picked up a shovel and started digging up the dirt.\n\nThe three men watched me, their eyes fixated on each pile I scooped. With a few subtle encouragements by the Mayor as I dug deeper and deeper and deeper until the hole was tall enough for me to stand in.\n\n\"That's a good hole,\" the Mayor commented.\n\n\"Agreed, a good hole there Frank. A good one indeed.\"\n\nI reached for a hand above to climb back out, but the men recoiled at my extension.\n\nNow I've been home-free for some time now, for most durations of my adult life in fact, so I knew, or at least felt as if I knew their reasoning for not wanting to touch the dirtied hand of a man with no land. And thought nothing more of it as I pushed against the shovel, crawled onto my belly, and hoisted myself clear from the hole I had dug.\n\n\"Could you giver him a push,\" I motioned to the casket, still breathing plenty hard from my climb.\n\nThe men shook their heads. The Mayor stating loudly, \"This is your job. We're only here to see you do it right.\"\n\n\"It's going to break,\" I warned.\n\n\"They'll eventually break,\" the Priest replied.\n\nNo one else said another word, so I nodded during the silence, \"Alright. Here we go then.\" I pushed the casket until it was near the mouth. And then with as much gentleness as I could manage, I lowered the thing inside. Indeed the wood groaned as it cracked open in one corner when my leverage gave. I looked up afraid of what I had done, but none of the men were concerned. So I carried on as nothing had changed.\n\nWhen I finished laying it flat, I got the shovel in my hands again and piled on the dirt.\n\nThe look on their faces, the size of their eyes, the way they watched me throw every shovel of dirt inside. It must be what an Olympian feels like. Judged, awe, and all inspiring; if I do be bold. And as the dirt flattened plainly, they clapped. Clapped. I had never seen anything of the sort. But my hands were numb, raw to the touch, and clutching a fistful of money. So I could think of no other action but to bow.\n\nThat night the Mayor and Paul took me down to the pub, where other townsfolk had gathered. They bought me drinks all night long, and the pub owner even put me up in the guest room. By the time the party had ended last night, it was no mystery to the townsfolk that I was a stranger. Between themselves they deduced it in an instant. But in exchange for my cover, I found myself waking up the next morning, still feeling my drink. The best part of it all, was that I didn't spend a cent of my earnings. Not to mention some time, late in the night, a handshake deal with the Mayor to be the town's newest undertaker had been struck.\n\nIt would be a far cry from the unencumbered lifestyle that I had grown fond of, but having a roof over my head, square meals three times a day, and a likeness to reverence from the townly folk, made it an easy change to adhere.\n\nEven if they did watch me dig and then bury the dead, each time, every time, with long lasting stares, and wide open eyes.\n\nThough it wouldn't be several months later, and two more buried bodies, until I started questioning, why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was September, when the first leaves were painted autumn. I had acclimated well with the residents of Achnought. And saved up some money. The plentiful walks outdoors to manage the property, and working with my hands; made me forget the mundane tasks and solidity of a careered lifestyle.\n\nI hardly even missed being on the road.\n\nAnd I had woken up, to one of those nights were I was glad to be Frank, blemished red, still, from the previous night's wine. We had buried old Mamie, in yester. Mamie Strue who was beloved by all the town's folk. Even in my short tenure at Achnought, the lovely lass gave me nothing but delightful impressions of Everyone's Favorite Grandmother. And like any other death in this here town, we celebrated the night away in her honor. It was always a party, each ending salute managing to make me question how many deaths they would carry on for.\n\nOld Mamie was an easy burial, as far as my one handed experience could tell me. Tiny and frail, no higher was her casket than my chest, though a deep hole I still dug for her, less the winter rains come and wash out the mud from her resting.\n\nA deep, dark hole, that the townsfolk were ever interested by; which caused a gathering around my work, as of late, when word spread of my doing. And now children, curious eyes, and their teenage sitters huddled around the shovel as a crowd would in a game of golf.\n\nSilent mesmerization, as I lowered the stick down to the ground, and away.\n\nAnd then, still waiting on their eyes, I patted the ground a final send to the sounds of clapping. Always the clapping. I dare not find out when they won't clap.\n\nI was still relishing the best of yesterday, when I began to make my daily rounds, walking the silent garden in peruse of a loose blade or unkept headstone, when I saw it in the morning dew. A figure laying atop the dirt of Old Mamie's grave.\n\nAt first I reasoned it had to be a morning mourner mourning the deceased. Ignoring the way the legs bent in the shadow. Even foolish enough to calling out my name as I approached. Less I startle their grief.\n\n\"It's just Frank, the groundskeeper here.\" No answer. \"I hope I'm not disturbing you.\" Still no answer. \"I h-hope,\" I felt a scream crawl into my throat. It lodged itself between the drummer and my swallower as I came upon the sight of Old Mamie laying on top of her grave. The dirt still fresh on her shoulder, and her hands completely clasped, just as she had been left when the Priest closed the coffin. But I was right about her legs, they were a tangled mess, it looked as if she been spit out of the ground, and her dress was worn, worn often as if she had slept a hundred years.\n\n\"Mamie?\" I crept closer. \"Is that you?\" I've heard of misdiagnoses, and bells tied by loving family members in the chance that dead wasn't as dead as they thought. Grave robbers, even. But this was beyond my cognition, after I had concluded that she was indeed deceased. My anger grew. For I surmised her disturbance the work of pranksters. Scoundrels with no gain other than to make a fool of others. A thing, I could never understand. \"Oh Mamie,\" I spoke to her as if she could hear. \"What have they done to you?\"\n\nI folded her legs neatly into place, moved her body and set her gently aside, and began to dig.\n\n\"This is what happens when you let them gather around your diggings, Simon. Simon the symbol of simpletons,\" I huffed. \"Like it's some sort of sport.\" I shook my head. Uncertain where the pride of work was coming from. \"Never again. No. Not ever. You hear me egotistical Simon.\" I vowed to the frail old woman, \"Mamie. I promise you this will never happen again.\"\n\nIt had nearly been an hour as I spoke aloud to keep my mind from the body snapping work. I had gone down to shovel in countless fashion, when a sudden pain split into the side of my arm. I howled as I raised it up into the dawn. A piece of wood, the size of my finger, had been lodged inside. I angrily searched the ground, panning my shovel head for an assailant before realizing that it were not the root of a tree or buried other. No, neither. It was a piece of the coffin.\n\nThe Coffin had been completely desecrated. Pieces of it looked as if it had been fed through a wood chipper. Almost nothing was left. Had I not known it to be a grave, I would have thought that I had dug into a rat's nest under the ground, for it be an infestuous sight to behold.\n\nI gagged as the smell came to greet me, Waving and wafting, stinging my nostrils, and creeping so deeply into my brain that I knew no matter how long, after, the mere thought of today would cause the smell to come crawling back out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a natural disaster would be used to describe my coming into town that morning, I think they would call it a storm, for I came like lightning and shouted thunder through Main boulie, tearing open doors, causing quite the commotion, dragging along others in my wake until I found Mayor Hannon eating his morning eggs at the diner.\n\n\"What's the matter,\" he asked. Glancing back at the crowd I had mustered, wiping the crust of toast from his mouth.\n\n\"Someone dug up old Mamie last night,\" I shouted my grievance.\n\n\"Dug her up,\" a voice behind me asked.\n\n\"Old Mamie,\" another followed.\n\nThe Mayor smiled, and waved the others off. Putting a large hand on my shoulder and seating me in his booth after pardoning the crowd. Not that they needed much convincing, as they nearly disappeared on their own after hearing the news. The diners too, their plates still steaming, with napkins thrown across them. And even the cook.\n\nI didn't know what was going on, but suddenly being alone there with the Mayor, was starting to prickle the hairs on the back of my neck.\n\nHe was a rather large man, had big shoulders, and a commanding presence. Meanwhile, I had shied away from society for the most part, long ago, still stuck in bygones. So when he looked at me with his big terrifying stare, I could hear the words come, but was unable to listen. Only catching the warning he gave, and what little instruction, \"Here's the key to the town's mausoleum. Put her in there.\" And, \"Never. Speak about this again.\"\n\nShaken, I too, hurriedly left. Letting the door swing behind me, peeking only in time to see the Mayor go back to his breakfast, before it slammed shut.\n\nI clutched the key in hand, stumbling over the sidewalk as I made my way, clawing and trying to find my footing, until my feet found fair ground and broke into a flat out run. I would have kept going if it hadn't been for my promise to make things right with old Mamie. And if I lived to be a hundred, I'll never understand why my word seemed so important that day. Perhaps it was also the way the Mayor looked at me, expecting me to fulfill my duties. And I dared not care to find the else.\n\nWhatever the cause, my run came to a jog, and then walk as I drew closer to the cemetery, catching my breath, staring at the long road ahead of me, out of Achnought, ahead. Knowing that no one could stop me if I just kept going. Instead, I turned at the gate, walked between the rows of gravestones sticking out of the ground like sore thumbs, in order to crouch next to the old figure that was Mamie Strue.\n\nShe was still laying as I left her. Neat, and frail looking as ever. Nothing terrifying, other than the fact that death had come to her, touched her, took her. So I placed my hands over where death might have, and carried her to the mausoleum.\n\nWhen I first took the job, I had been told to not step inside until it was necessary. They didn't even trust me with the key. Something that disturbed me before, but now I wish I hadn't been 'been bothered' to be bothered.\n\nI slipped the iron tip into the gothic lock and heard the tumblers click into place. When I looked inside, I was not prepared for what I saw. It was filled with bodies! And they were standing! Still in rows, clinging dearly to the flesh of their living days. Their faces deeply sunken, eye lids dried and pried back from decay, standing in neat, and nearly made me drop the old woman in my arms.\n\n\"Shit you fucking ass lickers,\" I cursed. Once I got a grip of myself, \"Hello,\" I called out. Not thinking about the consequence of, if something answered. Relieved when nothing did. \"Damnit. I nearly crapped myself.\" My eyes skipping along the rows of the dark, gaunt faces as I spoke to liven the atmosphere. Each one was thin, and hauntingly pale. They stood like a forest of white birch. Stiff as one too.\n\nI didn't know what to do. Could have been standing there stricken in fear all day. But I decided, eventually, that were not a thing for me. Nor a place I wanted to spend time in any longer. So I found a place, wide enough, for me to lay down Old Mamie. And I backed away, with my eyes still on the standing dead. Closing the door shut behind me, and knotting the lock.\n\nAnd here's the part where I wished that curiosity didn't best me. But it did. As I looked through the bars near the top of the door and saw the figure of Old Mamie, lying on the floor, slowly start to rise. Causing the dirt to fall from her hair as her broken legs creaked uncertainly next to an old man that I recognized from the photo albums at her wake, to be none other than Don Strue, her husband.\n\nI wished I could have found it to be sweet, but truth is, I ran back to my house and slammed the door shut, and would not have come out for several days. More, if I had my choice, if not for the trees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

        "text": "This is a warning, I am the living reason why you should never do what I am about to tell you. There are things in this world that exist, some that we do not understand or believe. This is what happened to me and my two friends four years ago and why I am now paying the price.\n\nMe and my two friends Nathan and Charlie loved our horror films, conventions and events. We had also done lots of Ouija boards, pentagram rituals, chanting and the rest! Now I know this may sound dangerous to some, but we really didn’t believe in all that and what these things apparently bring upon their victims. \n\nWe would always say that it was a ploy to invest people in the horror genre and make horror films, games and experiences more scary.  In fact we were actively looking at new ways to summon “demons, spirits and witches” with chants, practices and actions. \n\nHow naive we were is beyond me but look we were young and dumb. Now I’m sure many are accustomed to the film “Candyman”, say his name five times in mirror and he comes and kills his victims. Nathan and Charlie liked to browse the dark web, they even got mystery boxes delivered, one of the boxes even contained a blood stained knife. Nathan had a sizeable YouTube channel until it was taken down. I didn’t really get involved in any of that stuff though. \n\nOne Friday night they both came round with something new to try and they said it was like the film Candyman. They explained that they found a phrase online that is said to summon the devils daughter named “Lucia”. I was intrigued and prompted them to tell me more. Nathan passed me a printed piece of paper with four written lines on it:\n\n‘Lucia, Lucia, demon of the night,\nI speak your name with fear and spite.\nI call forth your power, dark and divine,\nI pray to survive until I am thine.’\n\nHe told me that we have to say the lines into parallel mirrors, then she would appear behind you slowly. Lucia makes her way through the reflections, until finally she takes you. He was laughing by the end of that sentence at how stupid it sounded. I questioned him on what he meant by the “parallel mirrors”, he said it’s like when you have two mirrors facing each other it’s as if there is an almost an infinite amount of reflections. I immediately went back to him saying that I have that in my bathroom! He leaned in and stared at me, then snapped back saying that’s why we are here!\n\nWe each stood in front of the mirror, I had a smaller mirrored medicine cabinet adjacent to the main one above the sink. One at a time we said the satanic phrase, Charlie first, then Nathan. The tension grew after each one of us had finished. I went last, I finished the last word and the light went off. I shouted “what the hell!” It turned out to just be Nathan messing around. \n\nWe all looked into the mirror again but nothing happened. Charlie was the first to say it was all bullshit, like the rest of the stuff we had tried many times before. We all then went downstairs to watch some zombie budget film.\n\nLater that night after the guys had left I went to clean my teeth, as I was half way through  brushing my stomach dropped. I looked up to the train of mirrors in front of me. Just before my view was blocked by my own reflection, a girl stood in the distance. \n\nI couldn’t make out many features as she was so small, every time I moved myself for a better view I would still be in the way. I stared intently at her, she wasn’t disappearing. I know we had a few beers earlier and I put it down to the alcohol. I went to bed convincing myself it was all in my head. \n\nI woke the next morning, as I went into my bathroom my mind went back to what I had seen last night. I looked in the mirror, she was there again. This time she was not in the furthest reflection, she had moved forward to the next one up. I could see more features; a white dress with red patches, black straight hair, she was looking down to the ground as her arms dangled lifelessly beside her. \n\nI splashed water in my eyes and dried them with a towel. When I looked again she had moved once more to the next reflection. \nI rushed to my phone and called Charlie and Nathan, they both hadn’t seen anything and told me to stop being stupid. They were both working that day as they worked weekends so I couldn’t get them round to show them. I went online and spent the next four hours looking into what we had done and what i saw but found nothing. \n\nHalf way through the afternoon I received a call from Charlie, he was breathing heavily and was just saying “what the hell” repeatedly. I said back to him “you’ve seen her” his voice broke as he uttered the words she’s so close. I was confused as I could hardly see her the first time, I went back to him asking how many times he looked? \n\nHe said 6, she’s one away, like right next to me. I told him to get out of where he was and leave. I will never forget the loss of hope in his next sentence. “I’m in a cubicle, the toilets have mirrored walls”. I told him to cover his eyes and run, I would meet him outside his work soon. \n\nI turned up 25-30 minutes later, the place was evacuated with police outside. I asked some of the staff if they had seen Charlie and what had happened. They told me they heard a crash from the toilets, when they went in, the floor was covered in mirrored glass. Within the glass they saw blood with what looked like whole human finger nails and teeth. This was when they called the police. \n\n\nI called Charlie’s phone, I could hear ringing coming from a few officers outside the store. I went striding up to them, calling Charlie’s name as I walked. All three officers turned round and put there arms out to stop me. I noticed the ringing was coming from a clear sealed bag one of them was holding. They questioned me after I explained how I knew Charlie, I said nothing on what we had done or saw as they would have laughed it off. \n\nOnce I got home I called Nathan, he already knew. He was also questioned by the police. He said that nothing had happened to him and that I was making up the whole thing. He said not to joke around if something bad had happened to Charlie. A few words were exchanged and Nathan moved away not long after that.\n\nAfter all of this I took the cabinet down, this  was done at the cost seeing her again. I spent the next year trying my best to not getting myself into a situation where there were parallel reflections. A year and a half later I found myself in a double mirror walled public toilet. \n\nThe terror I felt as I went in and noticed was incomprehensible. There she was, only four reflections away. This time she was looking up at me, I could see her clearly. The black straight hair fell onto her white blood smeared dress, her eyes rolled upwards with only the red veins visible on the whites of her eyes. Her blackened fingertips capped with talons gripped the bottom of her dress. She was smiling at me, wearing deep red lipstick exposing yellowed sharpened teeth. Her pale, cracked decaying face glued to me as I walked in. There was a large bang behind me, i shot my head back as someone ran in. They apologised as they went into one of the cubicles. \n\nI looked back at the mirror, she had reached the third reflection from me. I started to panic, I could feel my knees shaking uncontrollably as her arm lifted. She was calling me closer with her hand. I shouted to leave me alone and ran out of the toilet. This was the last public toilet I have been into. \n\nSix months after this happened I received a call from Nathan’s parents, he had gone missing. The police had told them that everything in his apartment was left untouched except for the bathroom. This had been trashed,  was full of blood and broken glass. They had ran DNA tests and dental records, to confirm it was Nathan. He had gone the same way as Charlie. She had got them both.\n\nI have now been living on my own in the countryside for two years, I only leave the house once or twice a month for a walk. I get all of my groceries and essentials delivered as I can’t risk supermarkets or stores. I own no mirrors only a laptop which I have put a non reflect screen cover on. I have only seen her twice these last two years, the last time she was reaching out to grab me. I know if I ever see her again it will be the last thing I ever see. \n\nYou have all been warned, please don’t make the same mistakes we did. It will cost you your life either way.",

        "text": "Her eyes, pitch-black yet bizarrely luminous, scanned my body in search of what I'd taken. I tried to keep still, praying she'd see that the jewels weren't on me; that she'd notice - without me having to move and risk misinterpretation - the backpack hanging from the tree branch overhead.\r\n\r\n\nWith my arms kept at my sides and my legs pressed together, I looked up into hers, and intently turned my gaze to the bag just inches above her. She'd pounced on me from some perch in the trees, knocking the bag loose from my hand. She’d apparently tracked my progress out of the earthen cavity – out of her den. How could I have known that I was stealing from a horror of the wood?\n\r\n\nShe met my fear-widened gaze for a moment, the two *regularly situated* eyes glaring, a hatred inhuman and unreal practically emanating from them. The third eye, embedded in her forehead and undeniably, repulsively *dead*, stared with milky lifelessness to my right.\r\n\r\n\nFinally, just when it seemed as if she'd collapse my skull with a horned headbutt, she tilted her head skyward; freeing dead leaves from her sylvan hide. Her glare landed on the bag, and her rigid, animalistic posture relaxed somewhat. The still-vestigial tail she'd grown whipped almost playfully behind her; the stench that had been falling from her body changed, becoming almost sweet; no longer bearing the rancid notes of extreme decay. Her whole demeanor became almost enchanting, and the black terror I'd felt only moments before was replaced with...affection, adoration, even. As if I'd somehow fallen in love with this twisted fae-woman.\r\n\r\n\nRising from her crouched position, she reached out with a leaf-gloved hand and retrieved the bag, delicately pulling it away from the branch. With a grace that was the polar physical opposite of the savagery she'd displayed mere moments before, she crawled away from me with the bag cradled in her arms.\r\n\r\n\nChancing my safety, I sat up and leaned against a tree. She paid the movement no mind, all her focus remaining on the bag. She spent a second examining it, then deftly tore it open. Upon seeing its contents, her body language relaxed even further, and my strange attraction towards her doubled. \n\n \r\nI felt a sudden urge to embrace her, enchanted as I was. But my remaining reason - however depleted - kept me seated. I knew that there was some sort of manipulation at work, some disarming pheromonal effect – if not actual sorcery. \r\n\r\n\nDelicately, she scooped up the white, perfectly ovoid objects and held them up to the sunlight. Dumbfounded, I watched as life came to the third eye in her forehead. A pupil and cornea appeared, both burning with that black brilliance, like the corona and core of some nightmare sun. The eye peered at the jewels, plainly mesmerized by them.\r\n\r\n\nThe bony horns atop her head lost some of their jaggedness and rigidity, drooping down harmlessly; and the tail she'd started to grow again receded into her spine. The leaves that had acted as a hide curled inward, no longer bearing their sharp edges. I found myself thinking, \"Wow, how could I ever have feared this creature? She's beautiful...\"\r\n\r\n\nBut before I could further ruminate on the idea, she spoke in a voice that was – despite her inhumanity – immaculately articulate: \"I wonder, should I peel open that stomach of yours and inject my poison right into your gut, so you suffer slowly? Or, should I carve out your heart -  whilst keeping you alive, of course - and roast it on an open fire right in front of you?\"\r\n\r\n\nEven as I heard these horrific contemplations, I found myself succumbing to an even deeper spell of infatuation. I couldn't remember a time when I'd felt so utterly enthralled by a regular woman, and yet here I was - spellbound by some she-creature of the forest, from whom I'd taken precious jewels or artifacts of some kind.\n\n\r\nI hadn't intended to *steal*, I’d stumbled upon a massive, peculiarly warm hole in the earth, wherein was buried a handful of pearlescent objects. Who wouldn't have thrown them in their backpack?\r\n\r\n\nHelpless, rendered immobile by the gravity of my inexplicable love for her, I watched as she placed the bundle into a steamy orifice that had soundlessly opened up in her abdomen. She then rose to her full height - no less than seven feet - and pointed a knife-point nail at me.\r\n\r\n\nIn the same uncannily articulate speech she'd used before, she said, \"I will not harm you, human. But the next time you enter my woods, I will do just as I'd said. You and your kind have trespassed enough, and your attempted theft of my property was reason enough for me to kill you. But I won't. Go now.\"\r\n\r\n\nAs if a weight had been lifted from me, I felt my body slacken, and the air around me lost some of the tension that had stealthily accumulated around me. I tested my limbs, and found that I could move them. Scrambling to my feet I sputtered out my apologies, to which she responded with narrowed eyes and low, almost insectile chittering. \n\n\r\nRegaining a little of my composure as I brushed away the last of the leaves, I met her gaze and said, \"I'm sorry for stealing your jewels.\"\r\n\r\n\nShe laughed, a cackle as of some long-mad crypt keeper conversing with a corpse. A hand went to her stomach, and the sweltering orifice re-opened. Showing no sign of discomfort, she reached inside and removed one of the glimmering ivory objects. \r\n\r\n\n\"These are no jewels, child. They're eggs. Quite expensive. I wasn't just going to let you run off with them. I paid too much.”\r\n\r\n\nHer grip tightened, crushing the egg. Yolk, sickly purple, fell from the shell; sliding down her wrist. With a forked grey tongue she licked up the juices, letting not even a single drop go to waste. She then flicked away the debris of the shell and closed the orifice, ending the gruesome demonstration. \r\nHad I not still been under the effects of her enchantment, I probably would've puked. \r\n\r\n\n\"Ahhh, fresh from the aerie. They’re organic dragon eggs, you see. None of those caged, sweatshop wyvern eggs the harpies eat. Terribly, evilly expensive.\"\n\r\nHer third eye winked at me, and I was finally instilled with enough disgust and terror to turn away and flee.",

        "text": "It was my cousin Bill who first told me about the Legend of Long Legged Larry.\n\nBill and I used to be best friends, and I always spent the long, hot weeks of summer in his small town in the middle of nowhere. In 2002, however, things changed. I guess that’s puberty for you. While I turned into a shy, reclusive nerd, Bill wanted to be known, to be one of the cool kids.\n\nIt didn’t take me long to notice how much he’d changed. His entire demeanor was different, the way he carried himself and even how he spoke. I could also tell he wasn’t too happy to have ‘that little nerd’ around, as he referred to me to his so-called friends, the cool kids he was so desperate to impress.\n\nWhenever we met them, he’d make fun of me, and before long, I became the butt of their collective jokes. Even worse, Bill began treating me like I was an idiot, and never lost a chance to belittle me.\n\nIt was one of these friends, I later learned, who’d told Bill about the supposed urban legend.\n\n“What’s a Long Legged Larry?” I asked when he told me about it.\n\nInstead of answering me, Bill scoffed and made it an effort to let me know how dumb I was for not knowing.\n\n“How can you not know about it? God, you’re so stupid...”\n\n“I bet you just heard it from one of your friends,” I retorted.\n\nThis landed me one of his trademark thigh knocks. I cursed in pain and hobbled over to the couch in his room. While I rubbed what I knew to become a heavy bruise, he reiterated the story he’d heard.\n\n“Nobody knows his real name, but he’s a serial killer who escaped from a nearby mental institution,” Bill started, his voice nothing but a conspiratorial whisper.\n\n“He’s a mutant with long, spidery legs who was abandoned at birth. They say he grew up in the woods around town, but one night he came back and hunted down his entire family. He beat them all to death with his long legs. They say he’s more a spider than a man, eight feet tall and-“\n\n“This is so freaking dumb,” I mumbled to myself as I listened.\n\n“Oh yeah? You’ve just got no clue, that’s all!”\n\nYeah, sure, I thought, but kept my mouth shut.\n\nI’d hoped that was it, that this silly legend was nothing but another story to annoy me with and to act out the superiority he felt over me. Yet Bill was desperate to prove himself to his new friends. He probably thought he could be accepted into their little clique, if he could prove there was more to Long Legged Larry.\n\nAt first, he’d merely talk about it, but soon enough, he dragged me along and made me help him with his ‘research,’ as he called it.\n\nDay after day I was forced to trudge after him as he went through town, asking people if they’d heard about the legend.\n\nMost people, of course, had never heard about it, and I thought it was nothing but bullshit, an elaborate joke Bill’s friends had played on him. Occasionally, though, faces lit up in recognition, and slowly, ever so slowly, we learned more bits and pieces of the legend.\n\nAn old drunk told us that Long Legged Larry had once been the main attraction of a freak show or curiosity cabinet, but escaped and now roamed the wilderness around town. A scruffy looking young man at the town’s internet cafe told us he was the result of a failed government experiment.\n\nThere were as many takes on the story as there were people who’d heard about it. They ranged from ancient horrors to athletes having turned into serial killers.\n\nYet they all agreed on one thing: his legs were special; either too long, too strong, or... in one case, he had too many of them.\n\nOne day, Bill struck gold. Once again, we were at the town’s internet cafe. While I was browsing what could barely be called the internet, reading up on games, Bill was busy doing research.\n\n“That’s it!” he suddenly exclaimed from the seat next to me.\n\nI looked over at him, eyebrows raised, and a second later, he pulled me off my seat and in front of his screen.\n\nIt was an old news story from the late 60s or early 70s. A group of teenagers had gone out into the woods to have some fun, and only one of them returned. He was out of it when police found him and said he and his friends had been hunted down by something out in the woods.\n\nI turned back to Bill, but he gave me an annoyed expression, urging me to read on. With a sigh, I turned back and continued reading the article, not sure what the big deal was. When they questioned the teen, he eventually admitted they’d gone out to the old steel mill. When the police checked the place, they found nothing. Not a hint of wild animals, serial killers, or whatever the young man claimed he’d seen. Yet they also found none of the bodies.\n\n“So?” I asked, turning back to Bill.\n\n“What do you mean, so? Did you read it? He’s got to be out there! I should’ve known he’s hiding out by the old steel mill with all the talk about it and what not!”\n\n“What do you-?”\n\nOh no, don’t tell me... Bill’s expression, however, had already changed.\n\n“We’re so going!” he brought out in an overly excited voice that made what few other patrons were at the place look up.\n\n“Oh, come on, Bill. I’m not going to some stupid abandoned place in the middle of-“\n\nI was cut off by another thigh knock.\n\n“Why are you always such a pussy? This is going to be awesome! Who knows, maybe we’ll even find out what happened to those teenagers that went missing!”\n\n“That was thirty years ago. Even if someone was out there back then, he’s probably long gone, dead, or even-“\n\n“You know, if you don’t come along, I’ll tell everyone you’re in love with Susan Kingsley!”\n\n“Who’s Susan Kingsley?”\n\nI could see the anger and frustration on Bill’s face. For a moment, he opened his mouth, but then closed it again.\n\n“You know what? Fine, whatever!”\n\nWith that, he stormed off.\n\nOnce more I’d hoped this settled the issue, but Bill wasn’t one to give up easily. No, things always went his way, even if he had to make sure they did. For days, he annoyed the hell out of me, even more so than before. He started making these strange spider noises, kicked me with his legs, and even tried to scare me in the middle of the night, pretending to be Long Legged Larry.\n\nEventually, I had enough.\n\n“You know what, fine. Let’s check the damned place out.”\n\nOnly an hour later, we were on our way, riding our bikes through town and then deep into the forests around it.\n\nWe could already see the first signs of the old steel mill from afar. Its giant, derelict chimneys rose high above even the tallest trees. A testament to the town’s long forgotten, industrial origins. Once we got closer, however, we saw that the once imposing building was now nothing but an overgrown ruin that had long since been reclaimed by nature. The only thing not in sheer and utter disrepair was the huge steel fence surrounding the building, sprouting a variety of ‘Do Not Enter,’ and ‘Parents Are Liable for Their Children’ signs.\n\n“How long you think this place’s been abandoned?” I asked as we pushed our bikes into the nearby underbrush.\n\n“You really know nothing, do you?” he started, letting out an over-exaggerated sigh, and rolling his eyes.\n\n“It was closed down in 1946, after the end of World War II. I heard they did experiments in there, created some sort of new weapon to fight the Nazis, but then...”\n\nI didn’t bother to listen anymore. This was another story he’d heard from one of his friends, or it was something he’d made up on the fly, hoping to impress me.\n\n“...still off-limits. Even animals avoid the place, and some years ago, Jerry told me a squatter went missing out here.”\n\nI heard the familiar rustling of the trees in the wind, but all other sounds had vanished. No birds, no skittering animals, nothing. It seemed, for once, at least part of what Bill had said was the truth. For a moment, I couldn’t help but be crept out. It was a warm summer day, but I still shivered.\n\n“What if there really is someone hiding in there?” I finally asked.\n\n“You know, there’s one thing I’ve not told you about Long Legged Larry. He likes nothing more than to eat dumb little nerds, so-“\n\n“Shut up, Bill. It’s not funny,” I mumbled. “I mean, don’t you think something’s wrong with the place?”\n\nWhen I said this, Bill gave me a cheeky grin.\n\n“Well, in case there is, I brought this along!”\n\nWith that, he pulled out one of his dad’s hunting knifes.\n\n“If Larry tries to get me, I’m going to stab him with this!”\n\nAs if to prove he was serious, he waved the knife around in front of my face and even made a few swift stabbing motions in the air.\n\nI opened my mouth to tell him how goddamn stupid he was, but Bill had already turned around and made his way towards the steel fence.\n\n“Either way, let’s find out if someone’s in there!”\n\nWith that, he began climbing the fence, ignoring all the signs fastened to it. A few moments later, he’d made it inside.\n\n“Come on already, you pussy!”\n\nFor a few seconds, I just stood there. Once more I listened, hoping desperately to hear any signs of life, but all was quiet. For a moment, I told myself to stay where I was. Hell, I told myself to just get out of here and leave Bill to his own devices. Then I sighed and approached the fence as well. Somehow I knew this idiot would get himself hurt if I wasn’t around. If that happened, I’d be in a lot of trouble if I’d just left.\n\n“Dammit,” I cursed and climbed the fence.\n\nWhen I’d made it, Bill had already hurried to the entrance of the old steel mill. I’d only taken a few steps before I stopped again. I watched as Bill pulled open the heavy gate. A cavernous maw opened up in front of him, one that seemed to devour all light in the area.\n\nFor a moment, I half expected a multitude of twisted arms, or even legs, to appear and snag him away right in front of me. Instead of that, however, Bill bent over and picked something up he’d found lying on the ground right behind the heavy gates.\n\nWhen I reached him, I saw he was holding up a page of an old, torn newspaper.\n\n“See! I told you someone’s in here! This place’s been closed down since forever, but look at the year, look at it!”\n\nA quick glance at the page told me it was from the year 1999, a mere three years ago.\n\n“Bill, I think we should leave. We don’t know...”\n\nMy voice trailed off. Bill didn’t even listen to me anymore. Instead, he tore open his backpack, rummaged through the contents for a moment before he produced a flashlight. A moment later, he ventured inside.\n\nAs I followed him, I realized once more how quiet it was. No birds, no animals, and not even the sounds of the rustling trees reached us in here. All we heard was the sound of our echoing footsteps on the old, cracked concrete floor.\n\nThe inside of the steel mill was entirely empty, and must’ve been stripped bare before it was abandoned. It made the place even bigger than it seemed from the outside. It was nothing but endless darkness, stretching on impossibly far in all directions. The only things I saw were a few lonely beams holding up the high roof above us, and the occasional heap of rubble.\n\nAs Bill walked on, the beam of his flashlight jerked around wildly, darting here and there in seemingly uncontrolled motions. At first, I thought he was scared, but then I saw his face. He was giddy with excitement.\n\n“If we find him, it’s going to be the most amazing story ever!”\n\nThen the flashlight’s beam hit something on the concrete floor, something that had once been very much alive.\n\nA gasp escaped mouth, and I barely contained the scream that had tried to escape my throat.\n\nBill, however, was already hurrying over to the bloodied remains in front of us.\n\n“It’s a fox, but it looks like it’s been dead for a while,” he said, poking it with his foot.\n\n“Yeah, but how did it end up in here? There are no other animals around and look, it’s been torn apart.”\n\n“Probably Larry,” Bill mumbled.\n\n“Shut up! This is getting creepy. Please, Bill, let’s just leave, all right?”\n\n“You’re such a pussy! But fine, if you want to be a baby, you can wait for me outside!”\n\nThis time, I’d had it with his stupidity. This place was creepy enough, but this fox... Something was wrong here and the last thing I wanted was to run into some deranged homeless dude or squatter, or hell, even stupid Larry himself!\n\nAs fast as my steps could lead me, I made my way towards the small spot of sunlight we’d entered from.\n\nSuddenly, I tripped over something. I cursed, trying to kick away what I thought was nothing but rubble, but when I looked down, I saw it was a heap of clothes, torn apart, half-rotten clothes. Yet what my food had hit was a bone, a long, big bone that was clearly not from a fox or another small animal. Then, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw something else between the torn clothes on the floor. It was the remains of a broken human skull.\n\nThis time, I could do nothing about the scream that escaped mouth.\n\nI backed away, stumbled over my feet, and crashed to the ground. Bill was with me a few moments later, his face a mixture of annoyance and curiosity.\n\n“What happened? What did you see? Did you get scared by-?”\n\nThe moment he saw what I was pointing at, he was quiet. When he spoke again, his voice was barely more than a whisper.\n\n“He’s a cannibal.”\n\nBefore I could tell him we had to get out of here, I heard it. Footsteps. Hard, fast footsteps that echoed towards us from somewhere inside the building.\n\nWhen I turned to look at Bill, he was as scared as I was. All the excitement had left his face as the reality of the situation finally dawned on him. The beam of his flashlight darted around erratically, trying desperately to find whoever was coming for us.\n\nThen we both saw it. A disheveled, older man came dashing right for us.\n\n“What the hell do you think you’re doing here?” he called out to us.\n\nWe both screamed in terror. Bill was already running, and a moment later, I’d made it to my feet and was right behind him. In his senseless panic, Bill wasn’t running towards the exit, but deeper into the building, away from the creepy guy who was about to murder us.\n\n“... come back here, dammit... going to get you...” I heard his voice from behind us.\n\nWe ran as fast as we could, but with each step, the man was closing the distance between us.\n\nAnd then, just before the man reached us, Bill stared right at me. His eyes were wide, all the color had drained from his face, but then a different emotion washed over it. It was guilt, and before I understood what was happening, he tripped me.\n\nAs Bill ran on, I stumbled, desperately trying to keep my balance, but after only a few steps, I crashed to the floor. For a moment, everything stopped. I stared after Bill, who was still running, continuing on deeper into the darkness of the steel mill, his flashlight beam dancing across the floor. Then I turned around. My eyes focused on the man who was coming for me, on Larry, and I knew it was too late. He had reached me, and before I could even get back to my feet, his hands closed around my arm.\n\nI screamed after Bill, screamed for him to come back and help me, but he just ran on. I kicked at Larry, tried to fight myself free, but it was futile. In a few swift motions, he restrained me and a moment later, he pushed a hand over my mouth, cutting off my screams forever.\n\n“Not another damned word!” he snapped at me.\n\nThen he dragged me back towards one of the huge beams in the empty hall.\n\nAs he held me in place, he said something else. It was nothing but a whisper.\n\n“Quiet, it will hear you, too!”\n\nI didn’t understand what was going on. What was he talking about? Once more, I renewed my efforts to get free, but then I heard it: sounds different from Bill’s echoing footsteps.\n\nThe sounds were unlike anything I’d ever heard before. The closest I could think of was bugs, a multitude of skittering bugs. Then Bill screamed.\n\nThis time, his scream was different. It was nothing but an unintelligible, bloodcurdling wail. It was cut short a second later, but its echo traveled endlessly and lingered in the empty halls of the steel mill. All the while, the man I’d thought to be Larry held me in place, still covering my mouth.\n\nThen something hit the floor, something wet and made of flesh and bone, something I knew had been my cousin mere moments ago. I heard clothes being torn, flesh being ripped apart, and then a sound so disgusting, I almost vomited. It reminded me of someone sucking the juices from a fruit.\n\nThe sounds continued for almost a minute before silence returned to the steel mill. All I could hear now was beating of my heart and the labored breathing of the man holding me in place. Then, the skittering returned, and for the blink of an eye, something was illuminated by the flashlight Bill had dropped.\n\nIt was a tall, bony figure, a figure so tall it almost reached the hall’s high roof. And as it moved, I saw a multitude of thin, spidery limbs. No, not limbs, I realized. Legs, legs skittering over the floor as whatever this abomination was dragged itself back to its hiding place.\n\nFor long minutes, the man kept holding me in place, not moving. His eyes focused on the lonely flashlight beam as he listened to the deafening silence all around us. As he did, I could see the terror on his face. Eventually, though, he opened his mouth again. All he said was a single, whispered word.\n\n“Outside.”\n\nWith that, he dragged me from the dark hall and back into daylight. Eventually, he let me go, and I’d have run if I’d had the energy left. I stumbled only a few steps before I collapsed on the ground, a trembling, crying mess.\n\n“W-what the hell was that? Was it... Long Legged Larry?”\n\n“Long Legged... what? Is that what they call it these days?”\n\n“What are you...?”\n\nMy voice trailed off, not even sure what I was going to ask.\n\n“That thing in there,” the man finally said. “Whatever it is, it’s been around forever, even before I was born. There’s always been stories about it and it’s probably the reason they shut down this damned mill all those years ago.”\n\n“But, but what is it? Some sort of freak or serial killer?”\n\nFor a moment, the man was quiet. His eyes wandered over the old steel mill in front of us before he shook his head.\n\n“Got no clue what it is myself. Might be something that escaped from god knows where, like some stories say, might be something much older. All I can say is that it’s not human. Knew it the moment I first saw it.”\n\n“First saw it? What do you-?”\n\n“Came here years ago with my friends when I was still a teenager. Got drunk and high one night with my friends, and wanted to figure out if there was more to the stories. God, how dumb we were. Not that we expected to find anything, but then, that thing...”\n\nHe was quiet again, shaking his head. For a moment, his body tensed up, and I saw the guilt on his face.\n\n“Was the one who led us here, and the only one who made it out, the only one fast enough to get away.”\n\nWhen I heard it, it hit me. The news story Bill had found about the group of teenagers who went here long ago, and who all went missing except...\n\n“The one who got away, the one from the old newspaper article?!”\n\nHe gave me a surprised look before he nodded.\n\n“But then, why’s that thing still here? Why didn’t they do anything about this, this... whatever this thing is?”\n\n“You know, boy, most people in town don’t believe those dumb old stories. No one’s going to believe some teenager high on drugs, talking about some spider monster that took his friends away. No, they thought I’d snapped and did god knows what to them, or that they simple ran off. Put me in the bin for a few years, but eventually let me go. Found nothing out here, no hint of what happened, and no hint of my friends.”\n\n“But if this thing-!”\n\n“It’s a small town, boy. No one cares. People go missing in the woods, and that’s it.”\n\n“But if you know it’s in there, why are you here? Why’d you come back?”\n\nAs I asked this, I saw how he balled his fists, and saw the look of frustration that came over his face.\n\n“Been watching this place for a good ten years now and put up all those sings to make sure... When I saw your bikes, I knew you’d make the same mistake I’d made all those years ago. Then I heard you screaming and knew it would come to get you. Tried my best to get you both out, but...”\n\nInstead of continuing, he just shook his head, cursing to himself.\n\n\\---\n\nAfter Bill’s disappearance, an investigation was started. I told them what I’d seen, what had happened, but no one believed me when I talked about Long Legged Larry. When they eventually checked out the old steel mill, it was a half-hearted effort, and, of course, they found nothing. All signs of habitation and all the remains we’d discovered were long gone. And Bill, Bills should stay missing. Just another person who’d went missing in the woods.\n\nAll this happened over three decades ago. The old man who’d saved me that day, Jonathan, is long dead.\n\nEven now, even to this day, the rumors of Long Legged Larry, or Sneaky Spidery Steve or whatever they call it now, persists and is shared by the teenagers in town.\n\nWhile most regard it as nothing but an urban legend, as bullshit, so to speak, there are always those just like Bill. The ones who think there’s more to be found out here.\n\nThey think they’ll be famous, they’ll come back as heroes and can upload their discoveries on YouTube or TikTok. And so, I’ll make sure to keep watch, just as old Jonathan did before me. Whenever I hear those rumors, those stories, I say it’s nothing but humbug, and there’s nothing to be found at the old steel mill.\n\nYet, I’ve got to keep watch. Not because this thing might get out. I know it doesn’t want to.\n\nNo, I’ve got to keep watch for those dumb enough to come here, dumb enough to believe in the stories such as the Legend of Long Legged Larry.\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

Tomorrow you’re all leaving, i will miss you.” shares the counselor. \n i raise my hand to speak, as it had to be ingrained into our mind that at all time we should follow etiquette. \n “do we still have to run l-“\nSLAM! The bulky lady burst open the front doors leading into the commons. I can feel my legs getting warm and my pants getting soggy as she tramps over to me.\n “y- yes” i gulped trying not to show fear. \n She opens her mouth to speak but suddenly stops as lights appear from across the parking lot. A mother steps out of her car and over to speak with the lady. \n “Excuse me, i’m Dans mom, Agnes. I’m picking him up early because he has a doctors appointment tomorrow.”\nAgnes looks at me squinting profusely.\n  “Ah you must be Xavier? Dans always tells me how fun and daring you are. One moment i can recall is when he told me you got up onto a table and threw spaghetti at the head mistress, what’s her name again? Hailey was it?”\ni look over at Hailey to study her face to see if she wanted me to respond or not, her face was sorta in a distorted smile with her eyebrows raised. She gestures at to go talk to Dan and Agnes. i walk over to Agnes’s car where dan and his mom are. \n “Dan is it safe to talk, is she listening?”\n “No.” Dan whispers softly is a reassuring type way. \n “Dan, you gotta sa-“ \n “shh.” Dan covers my mouth. \n “she still has ears you know” \ni try again in a more casual manner to not arouse any further suspicion.\n “Dan, you gotta save me. I will sneak into the back seat and cover myself so she can’t see me. i’m only 13 i still have 5 years when i can get free from this ‘summer camp’.\n “XA- Xavier are you idiotic! that would put my mom and me in danger.” \n “I know but-… Dan i need to get out”\n  “XAVIER HURRY BACK NOW YOU WOULDN’T WANT DAN TO BE LATE.” i hear being yelled from behind me.\n “Ah yes one moment please Miss.

I go into my room and change my pants as quickly as possible. \n “you deserve naughty time” Hailey snarled at me. i tiptoes across the hard cement floor so i wouldn’t be seen sneaking out of my room, i’m fairly certain the counselors saw me because we made eye contact but they were in the same boat as me so they let me go. Dan runs through the front doors just in time.\n “i forgot my belt!!” i run through the doors and into his moms car while they’re all distracted. when they come back to the cat i feels sense of relief wash over me. \n “i did it, i really did it.” I must’ve forgotten the time as i drifted off into a nap. \n “WAKE UP!

        "text": " \n\nwe were ushered into another room that looks like a hospital lounge room. Complete with a receptionist or an actor who knows?. I was just trying to make a buck a quick 20 dollars . i know most people dont look at the newspaper anymore plus i think that people just do linkdin now or something. I was snapped back to reality saw a man standing infront of me asking me to look into a strange rectangular transparent device with eyeholes in it. I took a quick peek it was like a void inside. It was snatched away after a ding was heard. He gave me a number and switched to another person the one beside me. Shall i continue the story? Good . i was homeless my house taken away from me my beautiful daughter taken away by child protective services and thrown out of my very own house. Memories flowed through my tears as i cried rain. I wandered the street the town melting into a confusing visual of flowing water. I was to tired to continue so i sat in a nearby alleyway wherein a man plain jeans and black leatherjacket said. ‘You doing good man?\n\nI responded ‘ doing as fine as you can see’ we both sat silent for a few minuets till he chirped back saying’ hey man here take it might help you’ i took the paper from his hand. A newspaper?\n\nThanks man but i dont kno- he was gone. Take care he said before he left. Mr miller? I awoke again. Looked into my surroundings all the other people were gone. Mr miller have you been waken? Im fine thank you. I responded to the lady dressed in a cliche nurse outfit. Stuff that you might find on halloween ya know the red crossed looking type. The nurse then ushered me into one of the rooms. It was labled the emergency room. It all seemed empty like everything was clean and sterile but too sterile beds were folded to completion no smudge no dirt can be seen it was frankly creepy. The nurse then led me into a room 2o4 spelled like that. The nurse opened the door for me like a celebrity smiling widely telling me to enter. I went inside and found a chair with  a strap. I was told to sit comfortably and the doctor would arrive soon. I daydreamed again to that time i got the newspaper. It was pouring rain found myself shelter in some abandone parking lot. Same people as me broken in despair and need of money. Of course with my only belongings gone and only possession in hand was a newspaper i just started reading. Dont know how many politics mayer elections with climate change is real i passed through till i found the job section. It read something like this .\n\nAre you broke? Then you need to sign up right now! We pay you 20-50 bucks depending on your performance. Anyone is allowed as this is a cleanup even the homeless are allowed we value you guys :D go to 73rd #### near the stair ##### bring more people we need them. OF COURSE WE WILL DOUBLE THE MONEY EVERY 5 PERSON YOU BRING COME QUICK TIME IS OF NEED. i chuckle at the very bad way of marketing i have seen. Not that it matters but money? If i am going to survive on the street or even get out of it. I need money. I scream HEY EVERYONE. All eyes were on me starring through my soul piercing me with pure anger. I found a job and it says i need bring more people im it says 20-50 bucks. They looked around each other and nodded. I showed them the newspaper and follow me through.\n\nI was drooling with the thought of money that it never crossed me how sketchy it was. I awoke from my past and saw the doctor standing in front of me. He was normal, standart doctor clothes but nothing serious. How are you doing? Im fine i responded. Good because we are going to need you awake for this one. Now i have something to ask before we proceed. Shoot i told me curiously. How do we reach into our inner selves. I uh dont know do- nurse send in the tv. The doctor then proceeded to tie the restraints to my body. Made me jolt then told me to relax and this is all part of whats about to happen. I trusted him. The doctor and the nurse left before leaving an old crt tv plugged into nothingness of an outled. It started playing unknown geotmetry i have ever seen. Shapes that felt had no mass and circles that bounce through other shapes. It was odd to say the least. I started seeing myself in the the reflection. Sad deep broken eyes. I started crying i cant stop crying. I cant stop. I felt myself slipping away. I did not even notice the gas seeping inside my lungs but i cant stop crying. I felt extreme sadness knowing i might never see my daughter again. But i kept crying. And everything went black\n\nAnother one down. The doctor said\n\nThe nurse squealed cant believe we got that many. Gosh darn homeless idiots they be making the world a better place\n\nNothing like food for the hungry. He smiled\n\nLets the prepare the shop honey. Cant be caught with bodies today.\n\nLets do.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnote: this is my first time writing a story so some things might seem off or bad thank you :D",

        "text": "If you’ve grown up playing video games, you’ve probably had to bear your parents telling you in all manner of assorted ways how video games rot you (one more unbelievable than the last, no doubt). If not, then believe me when I say that should the envy of all those who had to deal with what I described above fall upon you, you’d be crushed into a paper-thin pancake, along with the rest of the planet.\n\nGaming really is everywhere now, and despite the wide-ranging opinions of others, I have to say that it is an art form that I truly respect.\n\nI was a gamer.\n\nI’m sure you know what I’m talking about.\n\nTwo unreasonably large monitors.\n\nIdolizing Ninja.\n\nA desk set-up that would give anyone with epilepsy an instant seizure.\n\nA pair of headphones that looked as though they were meant to protect my ears from the sound of large-scale kiloton explosions.\n\nWasting an entire weekend editing dumb-ass Fortnite gameplay like it was a would-be Hollywood masterpiece, when in reality getting people to watch it would be hard enough when it was free, let alone if you charged them.\n\nI also enjoyed playing some classic games on the side on my dad’s old NES and SNES, which in my mind balanced me out by negating the effects of modern media and this somehow made me a more well-rounded individual (but which in all likelihood didn't do shit).\n\nBut I digress.\n\nYou, reader, might be wondering by now why I referred to my gaming self in the past tense.\n\nWell, that’s because what I mentioned above is all in the past.\n\nI am 18 years old as of writing this.\n\nI haven’t “gamed” in almost three years.\n\nSo, what do you think happened?\n\nDid I get addicted and was shipped off by my parents to some institution to get cleansed?\n\nNo.\n\nBefore you jump the gun, I have to stop you right now and just say that no I did not get scared straight as some parents like to say.\n\nI mean…at least not in the traditional sense.\n\nThe event in question happened around April 2020.\n\nLockdown.\n\nI was a stupid-ass sixteen-year-old, and, to me, Lockdown was the blessing from God I had been constantly nagging him for only he knows how long.\n\nI had unlimited free time to game to my heart’s content, and I resolved that I would make my gaming channel, with a grand total of five subscribers (all of whom I knew in my real life), take off and join the ranks of Ninja and Markplier, make millions, quit school, and prove to my dumb parents (who I love very much now) how profitable gaming was and how I wasn’t just rotting my brain all this time.\n\nSee?\n\nI wasn’t exaggerating when I said I was a stupid-ass sixteen-year-old.\n\nSo, instead of doing my fucking homework, all of my time was spent screen recording the worst gameplay of Fortnite and PubG imaginable while my crackling voice commented and screamed every once in a while, editing random and sudden zoom ins, making unfunny jokes and-\n\nChrist you get the picture.\n\nAnyhow, despite two months of effort, I had made a grand total of one dollar from all of my videos combined and gained only one subscriber (whom I also knew in real life).\n\nNeedless to say, I was disheartened.\n\nWas this the moment I decided to stop being a gamer?\n\nWas what scared me straight the cruel dream-destroying reality of this world?\n\nNope.\n\nI wasn’t ready to give up.\n\nI still blindly believed in my dream.\n\nSchool had just “ended” and I decided that my summer that year would be spent giving gaming my all (again).\n\nAfter all, I had to justify all the F’s I had “somehow” gotten.\n\nAnyway, I remember lying on my bed one random day and thinking hard (quite the challenge for little old sixteen-year-old me).\n\nI knew that to get subscribers I had to do something niche.\n\nSomething that no one else was really doing, if at all.\n\nSomething unique that was sure to gain a following and that no one else could copy.\n\nAnd as I lay there in bed, it suddenly hit me.\n\nI should play games that no one else was playing.\n\nBut by that I don’t mean games that were unpopular.\n\nI meant games no one else had access to.\n\nIt was around evening when I logged into the dark web through TOR.\n\nNow, before I continue, let me explain something about the dark web.\n\n99% of what you’ve heard about it on whatever creepy ass animated story or fake Creepypasta you’ve listened to is false (I hope you’re not surprised).\n\nThey’re false because they portray the dark web as a minefield that will pretty much fuck you up immediately, a place full of drugs and hitmen and fucked up individuals.\n\nWhile you can find those things on there, you don’t just stumble onto them as a first timer like all these stories talk about. They’re right about lists of .onion links, but you can call bullshit when they say they randomly clicked a link and found themselves in a digital hell of some kind.\n\nThe dark web, if I had to compare it to something, is a lot like 4chan.\n\nJust an endless collection of message boards.\n\nIt’s actually pretty boring, because you can’t just access the (hard) drugs and the hitmen and the snuff videos right off the bat.\n\nIt’s like being admitted into a secret society.\n\nThe ones who are in scope you out after you’ve shown interest on a message board and determine whether or not they should let you in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey then basically hack your private life for two reasons:\n\n1) To make sure you’re someone who can be trusted\n\n2) To use as leverage in case you decide to snitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides that, it’s just weirdos talking on forums about whatever bullshit’s going through their mind or you just ordering some weed.\n\nBasic stuff really.\n\nWell, I’m no script kiddie, so needless to say, I knew my way pretty well around these parts.\n\nI used a non-window operating system.\n\nDisabled all my scripts and FLASH.\n\nBooted up TAILS.\n\nHad a custom VPN I had someone whip up for me.\n\nThe whole One-hundred yards.\n\nOn the day in question, a hot summer day, I logged into a chatroom and posted a query asking about any interesting games I could play, shit I couldn’t find on STEAM or on the surface web.\n\nThe conversation went something like this.\n\n*Query: Yo Im looking for some interesting video games to play. Shit u can only find here in this part of the internet*\n\nIt wasn’t long before I received a message back from some dude with the handlebar “John”.\n\n*John:   WDYM?*\n\n*Me:*   *Ive got a fucking game addiction and stuff on STEAM no longer floats my boat. I want to know if I can find any “niche” good stuff here*\n\n*John:   Ah, how interesting :) I can tell that ur an amateur minus script kiddie (since U don’t know what Im about to tell u but since you seem to know how to keep urself safe here). As you know, games are an expression of humanity, as is this corner of the internet. People want to express themselves, but sometimes those expressions are not appreciated on the surface web, so they post their “artwork” here, where like minded individuals dwell. Games are no exception. I can send you a link if you want.*\n\n*Me: Whut U gonna show me some “SAD SATAN” shit? I already know about that bro. Stupid ass fucking game and I don’t want my precious PC to get any fucking viruses from something a damn fucking pleb made.*\n\n*John: No no, this is the real deal. “The Community” suffered quite a reputation blow from the leak of that game. A real piece of shit made by a pieceof shit whohad no feel for art. Luckily, its developers have been working hard to cleanse the palettes of us, the consumers, from that shit fest. Are you still interested?*\n\n*Me: Ofc*\n\nAnd just like that, he sent me a link and logged off.\n\nChrist…this link was something I had never seen before.\n\nIt was a .onion link, but everything before that was just a jumbled mess of letters, words, numbers, digits, random punctuation marks, and a few weird ass lines that made text distorted (those who’ve watched Game Theory videos on YouTube will know what I’m talking about). It wasn’t so much a link as much as it was a paragraph of the strangest collection of text imaginable.\n\nI’m sure everyone reading this knows where the fuck this is going.\n\nWith (and I am talking in a very literal, no exaggeration manner) absolutely no fucking hesitation, I clicked the link, and just like that I’d unwittingly stepped into hell, just like the so many unfortunate protagonists of all those fake dark web stories.\n\nThe website took three solid Mississippi seconds to load, and did so just as I was about to opt out.\n\nJust thinking about it gives me the impression that damn thing knew I was about to leave and didn’t want me to.\n\nThe screen immediately went black, and just when regret was about to hit me, a text box came up.\n\n*“Welcome dear player to our humble website. We appreciate your patronage and hope you will be able to enjoy our extensive collection of free games made by the finest in the industry. Happy playthrough. Sincerely, MOD.”*\n\nThe message made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI know, right?\n\nCountless times of wafting through the cesspool of humankind and a polite message is what gets under my skin?\n\nExactly.\n\nMy parents were asleep, I’d just drank a can of MONSTER and a can of RED BULL, and I was given the prospect of entertainment until dawn.\n\nAnd so I took it.\n\nI clicked on the search bar, but saw that I couldn’t actually search anything.\n\nInstead, a list of categories popped up.\n\nWhat were the categories?\n\nRape?\n\nMurder?\n\nTorturePorn?\n\nNope.\n\nNone of those.\n\nEvery single one was plain as can be.\n\nPOV\n\nAction.\n\nSuspense.\n\nThat kind of stuff.\n\nYou could select multiple categories and then hit search.\n\nI chose the following combination for my first game:\n\n**2D --&gt; Detective --&gt; Mystery --&gt; Choice-based**\n\nSimple, right?\n\nI pressed “ENTER” and waited.\n\nIt seemed to last forever, but finally, the churning wheel of loading disappeared and I was met with a retro home screen.\n\nThe title read, in all caps, “INTERROGATION OF FINNEUS WHEATLEY” in a strangely well-chosen color palette that didn’t make me want to vomit.\n\nNeedless to say, sixteen-year-old me was stoked.\n\nI thought I’d just hit a video game jackpot.\n\nFantastic games too niche for the mainstream all at my fingertips for absolutely free.\n\nIn case you’ve been wondering, no, I don’t have any footage of these games. My plan was to master their gameplay and then record it so that I wouldn’t embarrass myself like I had done before.\n\nYes, I do regret it tremendously, but what are you going to do?\n\nSue me?\n\nThis game, unlike a standard NES one, allowed me to use my mouse, so with that, I clicked “START”.\n\nThe screen went black, and a new image loaded on my monitor (the one that was logged in the dark web).\n\nIt looked like a photograph which had been pixelated.\n\nImagine the ending picture of the original “Resident Evil 2” on the PS1, which shows what happened to all of the characters after the main story line concludes, and that will give you a pretty good idea of what I saw. \n\nA young man with a poker face seemed to be sitting before a metal table, utterly motionless.\n\nBelow him was the word “ASK HIM”.\n\nWithout warning, two black bars with white letters appeared under it.\n\nThe one on my left read “why he called you there” while the one on my right read “how he’s feeling”.\n\nI was dumbfounded, so I just clicked the option on the right because I was curious.\n\nThe two bars along with “ASK HIM” disappeared, and a large rectangular speech bubble, with an arrow pointed at this “Finneu’s” mouth, replaced them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“I’m feeling fine detective. Thank you for showing concern and for arriving so quickly.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe large speech bubble disappeared, and the “ASK HIM” prompt came back up again, but now there was only one bar under it, the one that said “why he called you there”.\n\nI’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued at that moment.\n\nI’d expected to come across some sort of Sad Satan clone or morbid images or whatever shit idiots think would be fitting for the dark web.\n\nInstead, I had seemingly stumbled upon a hidden gem.\n\nI clicked the bar and the speech bubble came right back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“I know I am going to die detective. I know he will kill me. I find it only appropriate that I give my last confession before I am taken.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe speech box disappeared and two bars came up again.\n\nThe one on the right now read “who he thinks wants to kill him” and the one on the left read “Why he killed Sam”.\n\nI was tempted to just choose right but I just really wanted to get things over with.\n\nThe following are all the responses I chose with his answers in bold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“Why he killed Sam.”*\n\n***“As you very well know, Sam was my first time. I wanted my first time to be special so I chose Sam because he was special. It was that simple.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“How he killed Sam”*\n\n***“Come on detective! Surely you must know already!”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“How he killed Sam”*\n\n***“Alright alright. As you wish. I knew Sam lived home alone so I enacted my perfect murder. The perfect murder isn’t about how you kill someone. It’s about how you cover it up, and I knew that disposal would be my biggest problem. So I planned things out. I started to work at a taxidermy shop in town with my son, under the guise that I was being a good supporter for him to get some good extracurricular activity for his college applications. Mr. Flank, the owner of the shop, mainly made animal skeletal models and shipped them internationally to institutes of education. You know how he’d extract the bones so cleanly? There are special worms that eat only flesh. People like Mr. Flank have entire containers full of them. They just throw in the carcass part and wait for the worms to eat it clean. I found a big enough tray, and stole some worm eggs from Mr. Flank. I raised them all on my own patiently. Once they were fully grown, I put an ad on***\n\n***Craigslist for a child skeleton model.***\n\n***After all that was said and done, I just lured Sam down, killed him, and threw him into the vat. A week I waited, and the worms had done their job. I then shipped the skeleton off, and out of my life for good.***\n\n***Simple as that.***\n\n***I then just burned the worms along with Sam’s clothes and that was that. It was as if nothing had ever happened.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“how he got caught”*\n\n***“Just thinking about it makes me mad. Turns out you have to use Hydrogen Peroxide to preserve bones so they don’t yellow over time. What happened in my case is that the person who received the skeleton was a medical expert and immediately realized that he’d just received a real child skeleton. The rest, I’m sure you know. A fun experiment that ended up biting me in the ass.***\n\nThe bar on the right disappeared and the remaining bar now read “Why he needed to speak to you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the response I got when I answered.\n\n***“You see detective, I’m afraid I’ve been a tad dishonest with everyone. I’ll cut to the chase and just say that little Sam wasn’t my first. Nor my second. Nor my third. He was number thirty-one. Normally, I’d just cut up the bones and bury them. Sam, on the other hand, was a special case, as I thought it would be a neat idea for me to ship my ‘friends’ out. But alas look at where it got me.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Where the hell the others are.”\n\n***“I’ll be frying tomorrow, so I might as well say: I ain’t telling you squat chief. Just wanted you to know. You can doubt me, but you can’t doubt all those other missing posters. I am a fair man however, and I will say that I have mapped all of their coordinates on a special sheet of paper that you can only find in genesis. That’s all detective”***\n\nThe screen immediately went black, leaving me in total darkness for a moment.\n\nWhen it came back up, I saw that the style of the game had changed.\n\nIt now looked like…”Earthbound”?\n\nI saw a sprite that looked like a stereotypical detective – trench coat and hat and all – standing outside what seemed to be a police station. The palette of my surroundings was a dark blue and it appeared to be raining heavily.\n\nI used my keyboard, and found that I could move around by pressing the standard arrow keys.\n\nOn the far corner of the screen was an arrow that pointed to something beyond it, and I followed it.\n\nI found myself being guided through a deserted town, and without warning, the arrow suddenly pointed up.\n\nIt was a house.\n\nA really quaint house.\n\nI entered it, and the screen went black for a moment before I found myself inside the house, and I have to say, it was a real pig hut. It gave off the impression of a drug den, a place even pigs wouldn’t want to live in.\n\nI walked around and found that I could explore the whole house.\n\nThe arrow was gone at this point, so I didn’t have a clue where I was supposed to go next, but as I passed through a hanging portrait, the only decent thing in the whole place, a prompt appeared imploring me to “inspect” it. I did so and a pixelated photograph appeared, just like how the game was before. It showed a middle-aged man who I immediately recognized as Finneus. He was standing behind a young man who looked a bit like him, albeit younger.\n\nI understood now that I was in his house and it didn’t take me long to realize that the basement was where I needed to go.\n\nI found another door, and I was able to enter it.\n\nNow, my detective sprite was in a large and dark basement.\n\nIt was complete and utter silence throughout the entire game.\n\nBut I only noticed it at this point.\n\nI walked around for a bit, but no prompt appeared.\n\nBut then I noticed a container, a large sprawling one, right in the middle of the room, and it caught my eye.\n\nI approached it, and the long-awaited prompt appeared.\n\nI pressed it, but then, without warning, another sprite suddenly came out of nowhere.\n\nThe screen went black and I found myself in the same style of gameplay as before. I recognized the sprite that appeared before me as Finneus’s son.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe prompt read “What are you doing here?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was only one bar, which is the one I clicked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I came here to find the truth.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen went black for a second and the image changed. I was now facing the container.\n\nThe screen went black for another second, and the container was open in the picture that came up.\n\nEven though it was pixelated, the detail almost made me vomit.\n\nIt was another body, fresh, covered by worms.\n\nA single white piece of paper lay on it.\n\nThe screen went black and I could now see the paper.\n\nThere were locations and coordinates on the paper, about five.\n\nThe screen went black, and I was now facing Finneus’s son again, but now he was holding a gun pointed right at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I knew daddy wouldn’t go quietly like I told him to,” he said , “and while I am sorry for doing this Mister Forem, I would be remiss if I didn’t reiterate that, unlike my father, I’m not made for jail. I take after my mother, after all.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen went orange, and then blank.\n\nTwo prompts appeared.\n\n“Play Again” and “Exit”\n\nI clicked exit.\n\nI laid back in my chair and let everything that happened sink in.\n\nIt really was like a high.\n\nLike drinking yourself to a stupor on good alcohol instead of the cheap kind.\n\nIt felt good, but I had this feeling that ruined that particular “high” for me.\n\nThis gnawing feeling that I just had to act on if I wanted to relax.\n\nI went to my other monitor (the one logged into the surface web) and typed “FINNEUS WHEATLEY” in Google.\n\nI just expected some forum links discussing the game, but instead, I got an eyeful of news reports and archives about “FINNEUS WHEATLEY: THE GRANDVILLE FLESH REAPER”.\n\nI read everything.\n\nI read how he’d killed a local and sweet little innocent boy and had nearly gotten away with the perfect crime.\n\nI read how the detective who last spoke with him has never been found.\n\nAnd I read how he was survived by one son, Michael Wheatley, who preferred to stay anonymous.\n\nMy high went from me feeling as though my skull was full of clouds to feeling like my brain had been replaced by a bowling ball.\n\nI rubbed my eyes hard and wondered what I should do.\n\nThose coordinates were surely fake, I told myself.\n\nJust the fan fiction of a serial killer aficionado.\n\nThat’s all there was to it.\n\nLike a junkie for a fix, I was hungry for more.\n\nMy senses were screaming at me but I refused to listen.\n\n**3D --&gt; POV --&gt; Suspense --&gt; Exploration**\n\nI hit enter, and just like before, my screen went black before a menu popped up.\n\n**“VOYER’S POV”**\n\nThe only other thing was a “START” button, which I also clicked with no hesitation.\n\nThe screen went dark, and a loading wheel appeared with the words “searching for a server” below it.\n\nI waited, honestly oblivious to what I was about to be thrown into.\n\nThe spinning loading wheel disappeared, and a view appeared on my monitor.\n\nIt was a first-person perspective of a backyard at night. At the bottom of the screen, there was a piece of text which read **“Quebec, Canada”**.\n\nI am ashamed to admit it, but I really did feel intrigued.\n\nEspecially by how realistic the graphics looked to me, not just for a free game on the internet but for a video game in general.\n\nI tried moving around with my mouse and keyboard keys, but nothing worked.\n\nIt was only then that I noticed the bar at the bottom of my screen.\n\nA text bar.\n\nIn that bar, I, without much thought, typed in “Go to shed”.\n\nTo my surprise, the camera turned and started to move towards the shed in the far corner of the yard.\n\nI typed “Open Shed” and a gloved hand appeared on the screen and opened it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Enter Shed”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Take dagger”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Exit shed”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt felt exhilarating. Much better than “Until Dawn”. A true update of old text-adventure games.\n\nThe character was doing everything I told him to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Enter house”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Go upstairs”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe camera followed all of my commands.\n\nI was now in a bedroom.\n\nA girl, about my age, the one I’d seen in the family pictures on my way up the stairs, lay sleeping before me.\n\nShe seemed so real on my screen that I had to blink.\n\nA prompt came up at that very moment as I sat in my dark room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“End it?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, all I can do is swear on my honor, my life, and the lives of my entire family that I thought that prompt meant to end the game.\n\nThat, and that only, is why I typed “yes”.\n\nThe power plug of my monitor was pulled not a moment after I witnessed the gloved hand plunge the knife deep into the chest of that girl.\n\nThe last thing I saw on that damned thing were her eyes fluttering open in an instant.\n\nLike a dam, they held back a contagious fear that no one, certainly not her, should ever feel.\n\nOn the floor I collapsed and on the floor I cried and on the floor I slept.\n\nThe last thought that went through my head before I lost consciousness was “it’s just a game”, but my nightmares certainly didn't want me to believe that.\n\nI awoke that morning, about four hours later, and I barely had the strength to stand up again.\n\nSeeing my monitors made tears come to my eyes again and I still didn’t know why.\n\nI tried to calm down and thought I knew the perfect way to do so.\n\nI turned on my other monitor and hopped on Google again, my previous search related to Finneus Wheatley inflicting a whole other wave of disgust back.\n\nI just searched “Quebec, Canada” and went to “News”.\n\nAnd what do you think I found as the top story?\n\nA news article that featured the house I had seen at night in that “game”, only now it was covered by police tape, and one of the family photographs I had seen inside that house while climbing the long staircase glared at me from behind my screen.\n\nThe girl, smiling brightly in the photograph, had been killed, survived only by the others in that picture.\n\nI know I’m next if I report this.\n\nI know they know everything they need to know about me.\n\nAll I can do for now, before I turn in the evidence, is to be a son that my parents can be proud of, so that when I am taken, I can at least leave knowing that their time raising me had not been wasted.\n\nTo you, you know who you are, reading this, it has already been done.\n\nThere’s nothing you can do.\n\nYour operation will receive quite the blow, much like Playpen.\n\nI’m ready for you.\n\nJust please don’t go after my loved ones.\n\nThey have nothing to do with this.\n\nIf you can promise me that, I’ll go quietly.\n\nMom.\n\nDad.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nLove, James.",

        "text": "You won't find the town of Reficul, Pennsylvania on any maps, new or old. You won't find any mention of it in any old newspaper articles in the Pennsylvania libraries. Nor will you find even the faintest whisper of it in any state or county records. There's no mention of it in any official government documents, no census reports or tax records or land surveys. Neither will you find any hint that any of the 478 men, women and children who allegedly once inhabited the town ever lived.\n\nIt is a town that for all intents and purposes doesn't exist and never did.\n\nBut it does.\n\nAsk the younger people who live in the neighboring towns about Reficul and you'll be met with either a blank stare of ignorance or a mocking laugh or an eye-roll of annoyance. But ask the *older* residents and you'll get a different reaction altogether. Sometimes they become defensive, even outright belligerent, and flatly dismiss Reficul as a \"legend\" and a \"superstition.\" Others will deny any knowledge and say they've never heard of the town...but you'll see a different truth in their fearful eyes.\n\nBut there are a few who are willing to talk, if you ask them the right way. People who were young when the town supposedly disappeared back in the mid 1970s. People who claim to have even *been* there, and some even attest that they once had friends or relatives who lived in Reficul.\n\nAsk, and they'll tell you the stories.  If you're brave enough to listen.\n\nA rural farming village located in northeast Pennsylvania, the town was purported to have claimed 478 souls in the census of 1970. But by November of 1976, it claimed none. Every one of its 478 inhabitants vanished off the face of the earth one dark November night, never to be seen again.\n\nAnd not just the people.\n\nThe *entire town itself.*\n\nAll the homes and farms and shops and businesses that once lined its streets (along with the streets themselves), every bench and lamppost and stoplight and stop sign, every outbuilding and field, every pet and farm animal and head of livestock...\n\nGone. Vanished overnight, leaving only empty, unblemished open country. As if nothing had ever been there at all.\n\nYou would logically think that the sudden inexplicable disappearance of a - literally - entire town would cause a stir in the neighboring communities. That a media storm would follow, along with the intervention of state and government authorities who would launch a full-scale investigation.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nThe vanishing of Reficul, Pennsylvania in November, 1976 didn't cause even the slightest ripple with the surrounding towns or attract the attention of the media and the State Police and FBI.\n\nLife went on in its normal rhythm, undisturbed by the unexplained mass disappearance of 478 human beings.\n\nBecause, no matter who you ask, no matter how many county officials or courthouse records clerks or local historians or state authorities or retired reporters you interrogate, the answer will never deviate.\n\n*The town of Reficul never existed.*\n\nAs if not only had the town itself had been erased from the land, but also the *memory of it* from the minds of man.\n\nBut a few people *do* remember the town, or say they do. People who would have been very young when Reficul ceased to exist in 1976; children and teenagers and even a few who had been in their early twenties . Young people who swore adamantly that the town had once been there, whose wild assertions were met with scorn and disbelief and ridicule. Who were dismissed as charlatans and lunatics later in life by younger generations, who nevertheless adopted the outlandish claims of their elders and took them for their own, adapting and embellishing them into ghost stories to scare each other at campfires. Legends and rumors that no one took seriously.\n\nWhat happened to the town, assuming that it *had* once been real, that fall night nearly forty-seven long years ago?\n\nEveryone who knows the story has their speculation. The younger people will tell you that it was the work of aliens or some nefarious secret government experiment that went horribly wrong.\n\nThe older people who claim to remember the town have their own beliefs. Legends and rumors that the original founders of Reficul had been \"practitioners  of the dark arts\" that had fled persecution during the Salem Witch Trials to settle a township in the wilderness further south in the late 1600s. Rumors of dark rites and rituals that had been secretly carried on by the townspeople from one generation to the next, right into the middle of the Twentieth Century. Rumors of  unholy ceremonies involving orgies and incest and the sacrifice of newborn infants to ensure the town's prosperity.\n\nIt doesn't matter which story you believe. It doesn't matter where the truth lies or what truly happened to the town that cold, dark night in November 1976. Whether it was the work of aliens or demons or the wrath of vengeful God or any of the other dozens of wild theories.\n\nAll that truly matters is that *none* of it matters because it's just a foolish local legend. A ghost story for the kids and the unhinged ramblings of the senile and demented.\n\nThe town of Reficul, Pennsylvania, former population of 478, does not and never did exist.\n\nBut it does.\n\nI know, because I've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nI've been there.\n\nAnd you can see it too, if you're brave enough.\n\nOr mad enough.\n\nBut I warn you in advance that you might be getting more than your bargain for. Some things are best left unknown. And some places are best left forgotten.\n\nYou still want to know?\n\nAlright. I'll tell you.\n\nBut please, follow my instructions specifically and overlook nothing. If you mess up...well, you might just become Reficul's newest resident.\n\nI won't tell you who told me the ritual for locating the town, but I *will* tell you the ritual itself.\n\nFirst, a couple preliminaries.\n\nMake sure you have a car in decent working order. And make sure that car has a full tank of gas. If your car runs out of gas or picks an inopportune time to break down, odds are you're going to find yourself in a pretty deep heap of trouble.\n\nNext, make sure you have a good old-fashioned analog watch, preferrably one manufactured prior to 1976. Don't bother with a digital watch or your smartphone to check the time; modern devices don't work in the town of Reficul. Believe me when I tell you that you *need* a watch. It's *absolutely critical* that you monitor the time while exploring Reficul. You're going to want to check your watch regularly and frequently. I'll explain why later on.\n\nAlso, and this one is optional, a good blindfold would be a good item to bring along.\n\nOkay, so you've got your car and vintage analog watch? Good, we can commence with the ritual itself.\n\nOn the night of the new moon of any month, start driving south on I-476 just outside of Scranton. Reficul lies -- or did -- somewhere in between Scranton and Allentown, seventy-six miles south. You're going to want to start your journey no sooner than 7 P.M. and no later than 9 P.M. Be sure to keep a close eye on your odometer. Drive south for exactly -- and I do stress *exactly* \\-- thirty miles. Nothing eventful or out of the ordinary will happen during the first leg of your trip. When you've driven exactly thirty miles you're going to want to find an exit you can use to turn around, get back on the interstate, and drive back the way you came. When you've travelled exactly *another* thirty miles, turn *back* around and head south again. Then repeat the process (and be sure to keep an eye on your fuel gauge;  if you start getting low, look for an exit with a gas station where you can refuel, then resume your journey.) You might have to do this two or three times before you see the sign coming up on your right.\n\nThe sign reading: REFICUL EXIT, 2 MILES.\n\nThe exit sign that *hadn't been there* the first two or three times you drove along that stretch.\n\nDrive another two miles and sure enough, you'll see the exit approaching with a sign reading REFICUL.\n\nTake the exit and you'll find yourself on a two-lane highway with open country on either side of you. Drive slowly for the next couple miles. The only thing you will see will be the road in front of you, unwinding gradually in your headlights. There will be no sign of anything else on either side of you; not a tree, a building, or any living creature. Just your car and the road ahead in the middle of a vast, desolate and eerie darkness. A darkness that might strike you as being unnatural and frightening in its density and lack of feature. As of you were driving between two immensely high, endless walls of solid blackness. \n\nIf you have your radio on, at some point it should stop working. Just fall abruptly dead without warning. No white noise, no sound of  signal interference, just dead silence. \n\nThen, ahead of you, you should spot something in the distance. \n\nA small cluster of buildings. \n\nYou've done it. You've found the town.\n\nDrive until you reach those buildings. \n\nThen stop abruptly. Turn off your engine. And make sure your windows are all rolled up and your doors all locked. \n\nListen carefully and follow my instructions precisely. This is the most dangerous part. If you value not just your life but also your immortal soul, *do. Not. Screw. This. Up.* \n\nClose your eyes and just sit there. If you brought along that blindfold I suggested, now's the time to put it on. \n\nWhat do you do now? Now you just sit there. And wait. \n\nDo not get out of your car. No matter what happens or what you hear, *do not, for any reason get out of your car.*\n\nAnd for the love of God, *do not open yours eyes.* \n\nYou're going to be sitting there for a while, so try to get comfortable. If you find yourself suddenly needing to go to the bathroom...well, I guess an empty bottle or jar might be a smart bring-along to add to your list.\n\nBut I repeat, do not get out of your car!\n\nAt some point -- I can't tell you exactly when -- you're going to start hearing sounds. Faint and hardly audible at first; the sort of sounds you might assume at first to be in your imagination.\n\nBut they'll get gradually louder, and closer. \n\nThen you're going to start hearing the voices. \n\nPerfectly normal-sounding human voices that sound like they're speaking to you from right outside your car.\n\nYou might hear someone -- or something -- tug at your door handle, trying to open your car door. Do not panic, no matter how scared you become. When they realize your car is locked, they'll give up and won't attempt to force themselves in. \n\nBut the voices will continue. \n\nAt first you might only hear one or two, speaking to you from right outside the driver's window. But they'll increase in number until it sounds like a crowd of people are surrounding your car. You might hear fingers tapping on your glass, trying to get your attention. Pay them no mind.\n\nAt first the voices will sound calm and perfectly reasonable. They will address you by name and talk as if they know you personally. They might even sound familiar. You might even swear they sound exactly like people you know. Friends and loved ones. \n\nDo not listen to them. Do not believe what they tell you. And most of all, do not open your eyes and look at them. Just sit there as calmly as you can and ignore them. Don't acknowledge them; pretend you can't even hear them. \n\nThe voices will try to get you to unlock your car and come out. They will cajole you, coax you with a false sense of trust and safety. They will manipulate you; attempt to trick you. They will tease and tempt you. \n\nEventually, when they realize that's not working, they will become hostile and try to intimidate you with insults and threats and profanity. Do not be alarmed; they cannot harm you as long as you stay in your car. The only way they can hurt you is if you go out to them. \n\nThen the voices will become desperate. They will beg and plead and speak frantically, imploring you to unlock your car, as if they are in immediate danger and require your help.\n\nIgnore them, ignore them, ignore them.\n\nJust sit there and wait. And keep your eyes tightly closed. You *do not* want to look at them. You will not like what you see. Don't even crack open an eye just to glance at your watch; just wait them out. It will seem like an eternity, but suck it up.\n\n(What are *they*, you ask me? I couldn't tell you, because I didn't look. Neither did the old man who explained the ritual to me. His friend, who accompanied him, *did* look however...and that's why he didn't make the return journey with the old man.)\n\nHours will pass. The voices will not cease. They will clammer endlessly, trying to gain your attention. \n\nThen, at some point, you will notice the voices are beginning to fade. Slowly growing fainter. Until they diminish totally into silence. \n\nJust to play it safe, keep your eyes closed until you begin to sense the darkness transitioning to brightness. \n\nDaylight. Dawn has finally arrived and the night has ended. \n\nYou made it. Good for you.\n\nOkay, it's safe to open your eyes. You can exit your car now and begin to explore the town. But stay alert, and be careful. You're not out of the woods yet. \n\nFar from it.",

        "text": "  \n\nAs I lay flat on my back, wondering if I’d ever breathe again, I questioned my recent choices.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was a truck driver by day. I drove one of the smaller box trucks making deliveries. But that didn’t keep me off the interstates. Twice a week I took the long trip for supplies. \n\nDriving on the interstate with all the idiots made me want to do terrible things to people. \n\nLike when some grandma was sitting in the passing lane for an hour with her cruise control set on forty-seven and no one could pass her. \n\nWhen I got to a city the traffic intensified. Being stuck with the other four lanes of law-abiding traffic for a half hour and watching helplessly as these arrogant drivers in their BMW’s and Mercedes decided to pass everyone on the berm because they’re too important to wait like the rest of us, made me think of doing some bodily harm to some idiot drivers.\n\nAs I was heading back from my stressful trip, this idiot in a big rig decided that I was in his lane. I saw the tires getting closer as he changed lanes with no signal.\n\nI slammed on the brakes to keep from being pushed off the road at seventy miles per hour. \n\nDid he stop? No. Did he even slow or flash his lights in recognition that he’d done anything wrong? Of course not.\n\nI stared in rage at the truck that was pulling away from me and suddenly I felt my foot pressing harder on the gas pedal. I caught up to him and honked my horn so he would look at me. Then I gave him the finger and swerved into his lane. \n\nHe swerved away from me. I didn’t need to be able to read lips to tell the kind of language he was using. \n\nHe swerved back and I had to go into the passing lane to avoid him.\n\nIn doing so, I almost sideswiped a minivan I hadn’t noticed. They managed to avoid me, but that was when I came to my senses and realized what I was doing. \n\nI hit the brakes and pulled over to the side of the road. I put the truck in park and turned it off. I sat there shaking at the thought of how dangerous and stupid I’d been.\n\nIt was then I realized I needed a vacation. It had been two years since I’d taken one. And the incident showed me that the job was getting to me. \n\nI had lots of time to think about it and I knew exactly where I wanted to go.\n\nYou know how there are things you always want to do but you put them off because you don’t have time? That was the thing I planned on doing to regain my perspective.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI used to live in a small town when I was a kid. We lived on a side road of town where there wasn’t much traffic, but we could see downtown and the main bridge crossing the river. \n\nLike anything else, you grow up in a small town seeing certain things and taking them for granted. \n\nThere was a house beside us that was run down. I don’t ever remember seeing anyone enter or leave it. In the backyard, there was a car that sat outside the garage under a tarp where you could see the taillights and the back end. \n\nIt never dawned on me until I left, grew up, and learned some things. When I came back I realized that the car that was sitting there rusting apart was a 1967 Shelby GT 500 Mustang.\n\nLike other things you grow up thinking it was an old rusty car, not realizing until later just how special it was.\n\nThere was a building a few blocks up from where we lived that we would pass on our way to the store. It never dawned on me that it was anything special. \n\nAfter I grew up and came back, I found out it was a mental hospital. By that time, it had already been abandoned. But with my urban explorer sensibilities, I felt the compulsion to go in and see this building that used to be so well kept which now stood empty and deteriorating. \n\nI walked up to the corner and stopped to take in the sight of the weeds growing and windows that were boarded up. I felt like I had to see what was inside. I had looked it up online and found a few interesting articles about it, but strangely none that went in-depth. I ignored the assertion that the place was haunted. Many articles alluded to abandoned places being haunted. It increased the interest in the article and therefore the click rate. \n\nI had packed my backpack with the usual supplies and rented a hotel room on the edge of town. \n\nI parked in the parking lot and walked three blocks up to the building. I didn’t want to have a car sitting outside the building if people got suspicious. Urban exploring can be dangerous and, in some cases, illegal, so it’s usually good to keep a low profile.\n\nAs I walked up to it, the detritus and weeds greeted me. The entire building was made of yellow bricks, including the staircase. This made me chuckle. First of all, wondering how in the world anyone could justify that. Even if it rained, they would get slick as snot. Secondly, my vivid imagination thought, ‘I wonder if this is where Dorothy ended up.’\n\nI started up the stairs looking for the spots that weren’t about to collapse and made it to the front porch. There were some boards that looked a little dodgy, so I avoided them as I made my way around the maze of rotten wood. I finally got to the front door, which of course was locked and had a ‘No trespassing’ sign on it. Any good urban explorer will tell you is more of a guideline than a rule. \n\nI shuffled my way carefully along the few good remaining boards on the porch and made it over to a boarded-up window.\n\nI pushed on the board and it was pretty solid. So, I shuffled my way over to the other side to a board that looked like it had a small hole in it.   \n\nI glanced around to make sure no one was looking before giving the moldy board a yank. It didn’t come off with the first pull but did give enough to encourage me to try several more times before finally pulling it free. \n\nI ducked as the moldy splinters that held it into the frame showered down on me. I pulled the board off and set it down, feeling a sense of accomplishment only to be confronted by what remained of the window.\n\nI pushed the remainder of the glass out of the frame and climbed inside. What immediately struck me was the stench. It was part mold and part some type of decay. I reached into my backpack and pulled out my respirator mask and goggles.\n\nNext, I put on my gloves and snapped my body camera into place. \n\nI chuckled. Whenever I’d put these accessories on, I felt like an astronaut exploring an alien world. \n\nThe dust floating past the windows lit up as rays of sunshine penetrated the room.\n\nI stepped inside and stood in what looked like a reception area. There were old pots that had once held healthy, vibrant plants. But now they were just tendrils of decay laying on the floor. \n\nThere was a small reception desk that hadn’t fared much better. The wood had curled up and was beginning to fall apart. \n\nI pulled out my phone and snapped a few pictures before testing the floor down the main hallway. It seemed like the boards inside the building had fared better than those on the outside. But I knew not to take anything for granted. What looked like a sturdy board could collapse at any time, leaving me falling to an unknown fate.\n\nEvery step I took made a threatening creak, but as of yet, I hadn’t seen any holes in the floor.\n\nAside from the floorboards creaking, it was silent as a tomb. It was rather unnerving. The place was on the outskirts of town, like my former home, and it was only a few blocks away from the freeway, yet I couldn’t hear any noises from outside. It was like someone had placed a giant bubble over the place.\n\nAs I proceeded down the hallway, I glanced into one of the rooms. It was nothing extraordinary. It had a couple of old-style hospital beds that had cranks to raise and lower the head and feet of the patient and there were privacy screens just like you’d see in an old hospital. \n\nIt had the detritus of decay, but nothing that suggested anything sinister.\n\nThe newspaper article I had dug up about the place shutting down hadn’t suggested anything out of the ordinary, except mere lack of funding.\n\nI came out of the room and proceeded down the hallway, continuing to treat the floorboards with suspicion. The next room held more of the same. A quick scan revealed nothing extraordinary. The next several rooms were similar. They were patient examination rooms of a very generic design.\n\nI felt like someone was watching me. I could feel their eyes boring into the back of my skull, but every time I would whip around, no one was there. I chalked it up to the creepy environment and hearing my own breath through the mask. \n\nThe end of the hall presented me with a choice. There was a set of stairs that went up and down. I hesitated for a moment before choosing up. I switched on my headlight and took the stairs slowly one at a time. Aside from the creaks, they seemed sturdy enough. I gripped the handrail tightly as I rose. \n\nWhen I turned the corner, I was met with an unpleasant surprise. There was a large hole in the middle of the stairs. I snapped a picture with my phone, then leaned forward and examined it closely. It didn’t seem to be caused by dry rot. It looked like someone had taken a giant ice cream scoop and scooped out a perfect circle of stairs. I reached down and felt the edges. Surprisingly, they were perfectly smooth. No splinters, no rough spots whatsoever.\n\nThe hole was only a foot across. There were two steps that were affected. I eyed the stairs above the hole, and they seemed sturdy. \n\nI thought for a long moment, calculating the risks, before I grabbed the rail, bent at the knees, then jumped. \n\nI cleared both steps, landing on the one above the anomaly, with my balance teetering for a moment until I pulled on the handrail to steady myself. That was the exact moment when the railing decided it had done its duty long enough. The screws came loose from the wall sending me sprawling back down the stairs. I sailed over the hole, landing on the step below it and bouncing the rest of the way down to the landing.\n\nI lay there for a moment amid the cloud of dust that descended on me, checking to make sure everything still worked, and nothing was broken.\n\nI rose, dusted myself off, and made a run up the stairs two at a time until I leaped over the hole, landing above it and continuing my momentum the rest of the way up to the top of the stairs. When I got there, I paused and turned to look back down like I had just made it up Everest.  \n\nI pumped my fists in the air and spun around like Rocky on the steps of city hall. When my foot came too close to the edge, I nearly tumbled back down the stairs. I decided I had celebrated enough.\n\nI opened the door to the upstairs hallway, and it emanated a loud creak as you’d hear in every scary movie. I wondered if that would set the tone for this floor. \n\nI stepped out into the hallway and the first thing I noticed was movement. \n\nI froze. Something had darted into one of the rooms as soon as I stepped into the hallway. I was rapidly becoming less excited about my vacation choice but decided it was probably a raccoon or some other animal that had made its home inside the deteriorating building. \n\nThe problem was, even if that was true, a cornered animal can be dangerous.\n\nAfter mentally flipping a coin, I decided to continue my exploration. As tempted as I was to rewind the footage on the body cam and see exactly what it was, I pushed ahead figuring I would find out eventually. \n\nThe rooms on this floor were smaller and more comfortable. There were chairs beside each hospital bed, and there were pictures on the wall. It seemed like this was a higher classroom meant for long-term stays.\n\nI looked at one of the pictures. It was a painting of a severe-looking woman. Judging by her painting, she had never cracked a smile in her life.  \n\nThe next several rooms held this same pattern. The same comfort level and pictures on the wall. It was like they were surrounding the patients with the thought of these people in the pictures watching over them. \n\nIt was creepy, but I guess when these rooms were in use, it wasn’t common to have a television in each room. What was even creepier was the pictures had those eyes that seem to follow you wherever you go. I swore I saw the eyes move in one of the pictures, but I was sure it was just my imagination. \n\nAfter experiencing a room full of glaring pictures, I passed the next several rooms with merely a glance inside.\n\nThey looked the same anyway, so my anxiety justified avoiding yet another stare-down.\n\nI came to the end of the hall and looked out the window. It was odd seeing the street from this point of view. As I panned around, I noticed an old man dressed in shabby clothes standing on the sidewalk. Nothing about him was particularly odd except he was staring at me. I looked twice to make sure I hadn’t seen it wrong. But it was definite, he was staring directly at me.\n\nWe locked eyes and something passed between us. I had the feeling this man was important. Perhaps he was somehow connected to this place. \n\nHe smiled, then turned and started walking up the street. \n\nI suddenly felt like I had to talk to him. I ran to the end of the hall and bounded down the stairs. I tore down the main hallway toward the front door. In my excitement, I forgot about the weak spots in the floor and stepped on one. \n\nIt instantly collapsed from under me, leaving me grasping at falling pieces of wood. I tumbled through empty air and landed flat on my back. The wind escaped me and I struggled to breathe as I lay there in pain looking up at the large opening in the ceiling. \n\nIt was right then that I questioned my sanity for choosing this as a vacation.\n\nI was tempted to rip my mask off but resisted the urge. Being in the basement (if that’s where I was) would be the most likely place to encounter all kinds of mold and other things I didn’t want crawling around inside my lungs. \n\nAt the moment I couldn’t move, let alone rip my mask off. All I could do was feel the pain shooting through me and listen to the raspy breaths struggling to get into and out of my mask. I sounded a little like Darth Vader just before he died. That was a comforting thought.\n\nSeconds ticked by like they were stuck in mud as I waited for my breath to return and the pain to abate. I whiled away the time by trying to move and make sure nothing was broken. \n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, I ended my evaluation by announcing to myself that the only thing truly hurt was my pride.\n\nI slowly sat up and pushed the broken wood pieces off me while panning my flashlight around this new environment. \n\nThe first thing I saw was a row of old-style washing machines that had rollers to squeeze the clothes through. They were lined up against a wall that was decorated with cobwebs and looked like it had streams of rust starting where the pipes ran down the wall to the machines.\n\nAs I stood and started walking, I was nearly decapitated by a rope hanging from the ceiling. In fact, there were several ropes hanging in lines. They must’ve been for drying the clothes when the weather was bad. \n\nI followed the hallway and found it less refined than the upstairs. The walls were made of rough-hewn wood. The rooms reminded me of coal bins. I came to an old rusty door that was partway open. I tried to stick my head in and see what was inside, but it wouldn’t fit. I gave a solid tug on the door and it opened a foot or so, but rust rained down on me.\n\nI supposed the door hadn’t been opened in a while.\n\nI stepped inside and panned my light around. In the corner, I saw a pair of glowing eyes staring at me. \n\nI backed up and bumped into the door causing another rain of rust. The thing wasn’t huge. It reminded me of an opossum or a raccoon, except it had no hair. Calling it a giant naked rat wouldn’t have been too far off.\n\nThe room itself appeared to be a maintenance closet. As I panned around the room then back, I noticed the eyes were gone. That sent me into a full panic. It was bad enough knowing there was some creature down here with me, but even worse not knowing where it was.\n\nI darted out of the room, bumping the door, but running so fast it didn’t get another chance to dump rust on me. I was partway down the hall before I slowed to a stop and bent over to take a breather.\n\nAs I stood there looking down I noticed two ruts worn into the floor. I leaned down and touched one. It was smooth as if worn in over a long time.\n\nI looked down the hallway and saw the ruts disappear into the darkness. I pulled out my phone and took a few pictures.\n\nMy curiosity dragged me after these tracks. I nearly ran down the hallway ignoring room after room as I followed the trail. When I got to the end, the trail disappeared. It didn’t fade away, it just stopped at a wall. \n\nI searched all around for the tracks to go in a different direction, but they didn’t. They just ended.\n\nI remembered seeing something similar in a movie. I searched all around for something that would make the wall disappear somehow.\n\nThere was nothing on the wall. No decorations or marks. I stepped back and searched the side walls, but still, they were clear of any decoration or markings. \n\nFrustrated, I stepped back even further only this time I came across a small symbol, barely noticeable on the right wall. I examined it closely then pressed it and… nothing happened.\n\nI sighed and looked around for anything else that could’ve been useful, but there was nothing on either side. \n\nI took another step back and looked over the entire area. The symbol was around seven feet away from the wall. It seemed odd to have it that far away from the wall, unless…\n\nI took another look at the ruts in the floor and saw they were around three feet apart. The symbol was seven feet from the wall. Just the perfect size for… a gurney.\n\nI felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature.\n\nI examined the symbol again. It was a crude scratching of a cross. I pressed against it again and nothing happened. As I took my thumb away, I felt it move. I pressed my thumb to it again and began to turn. To my great surprise, I was able to turn it. It kept going with no reaction. I had no idea how far I would need to turn before there was any reaction.\n\nWhen the cross came to the upside-down position, it stopped. I stared at the wall in anticipation, but nothing happened. \n\nI turned to start back up the hallway when I felt a soft rumbling. I turned back to see the wall sliding to the side. I darted into the open passageway, not knowing how long the door would stay open. A few minutes later, as I followed the passageway, I heard the door go shut. \n\nIt wasn’t until then that I realized I had no way out of this place. \n\nI went back to the now-closed wall and examined it. There didn’t seem to be any markings, just like the other side. I backed up a few paces and looked for a symbol when someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned to find no one there. \n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. I stopped looking for the symbol and started quickly walking down the hall, hoping to get away from who or whatever it was that tapped me. I wasn’t a huge believer in the supernatural, but I didn’t discount it either. If someone wanted to get me, they would have to chase me. \n\nThe flashlight mounted on my head began bouncing as I jogged away, making shadows dance across my path. Just as I slowed down and convinced myself I had been stupid to run, someone tapped me on the shoulder again. I turned around but no one was there. \n\nThis time, I didn’t mess around, I took off at a full run. \n\nDuring the daytime, outside, if someone had tapped me and no one was there, I would’ve just brushed it off as weird and walked away. Inside a creepy tunnel underneath what used to be a mental hospital, I wanted out. \n\nSometimes the only way out is through. There was no way I was going back to the wall/door again unless I had no choice. \n\nMy mask began to fog up as my breathing became more labored from running. I had run flat out for over a minute and was winded. The mask wasn’t exactly helping, but I didn’t dare take it off. I had no idea how long it had been since this passageway had felt fresh air and I had no desire to suck up lungfuls of mold and who knows what else. \n\nI slowed to a stop and fell to my knees, exhausted, gasping for air. I fought with every ounce of determination in me not to rip the mask off. In the meantime, my back sent me painful reminders of the little tumble through the floor that happened not so long ago.\n\nIt took a good ten minutes for me to recover and breathe normally. Just as I was about to get up, I felt the tapping again.\n\nThis time, exhaustion won over terror. I turned to find no one there as before. I took the light off my head and shined it down on the offending shoulder only to find the biggest spider I’d ever seen in my life sitting there.\n\nI freaked out and swatted it away, tracking it with my light. It landed light as a feather on the dirt floor a few feet away and just sat there. I stared at it for the longest time, waiting for it to leap at me and attack. But after a few minutes, it turned around and scuttled off as if it was bored.\n\nOnce it was out of sight, I put the light back on my head and continued down the rough-hewn hallway. \n\nAt first, I whipped around every ten feet or so to make sure my former passenger wasn’t sneaking up on me. After a few times without a trace of it, I stopped looking. \n\nAs I plodded through the tunnel, I examined the walls. Aside from the occasional cobweb, there was nothing on the walls at all. This struck me as odd that there would be no lights, not even the occasional metal bracket to hold a wooden torch. It was as if whoever traversed this tunnel was on their own. \n\nI shone my light at the floor and the ruts were still there. It seemed like a long distance to travel if someone was sick and needed treatment, and it was going away from the hospital. It didn’t make sense, unless…\n\nSuddenly it became clear exactly what my destination was. I was heading for the morgue.\n\nI shone my light down the middle of the tunnel, but it didn’t light anything. Wherever the end was, I still wasn’t close enough to see it. I wasn’t sure what I expected to see, but it wasn’t going to be for a while. \n\nMy mind held a tug of war, go forward or go back? In the end, it was the explorer in me that won out. I was here to see what was in this building and now that I was in its very bowels, I was having second thoughts. \n\nI sighed and started forward slowly. It took a little while for my resolve to reach my legs. Once it did, my walk became a march. After a while, I saw a faint outline of something ahead. My eagerness and pace increased the closer I came. \n\nWhen I finally reached it, I found it was another wall. Only this time I knew what I was looking for. I stepped back a few paces and found the symbol at eye level on the wall. I turned the cross upside down and watched as the door slid to the side. \n\nI rushed into the next room full of the excitement of discovery, only to find I was in a garbage pit. There was rot and ruin in piles. As I flashed my light around, the room seemed to be lighter than the tunnel. When I stepped in, there was a flurry of movement. Eyes that I’d seen in the first room scattered all about. I jumped when one came my way, then seemed to realize its mistake and followed others through a doorway. I resolved not to explore that room.\n\nThe stench must’ve been horrendous because I could smell it through my mask. That worried me. If I could smell it, then it must be getting through the filters. What else was getting through the filters?\n\nI looked up and saw the ceiling of the room was much higher. There were three large openings above the bulk of the detritus in the room. They looked like they were some form of garbage chute. \n\nNow that the denizens of the room had fled, I looked more closely at the piles. I took a few steps toward the piles and saw white reflect back at me. I pulled out my phone and took a picture. The flash made the image clearer than my headlamp. I looked at the picture and there, half covered in filth was a human skull.\n\nI took an involuntary step back and scanned the rest of the pile. As I did, I saw a bone sticking out here and there. The more I looked the more I saw. There were leg bones and arm bones, and more skulls of varying sizes. The one that chilled me to the marrow was a tiny skull no bigger than a grapefruit. \n\nI needed to get out of this room right now.\n\nI dove into the first door I came to, no longer caring if it was the same door some of the critters had gone through. I ran out of the bone room and into a different hallway. This one was made entirely of bricks. The ceiling was low and arched with the bricks from the wall forming perfectly into the ceiling. \n\nI paused to take a breath and compose myself. How many bones had I seen? Dozens? Hundreds? I really wasn’t sure. I leaned back in and took a quick picture with my phone then got out of that room. I didn’t want to think about it now, but I was sure this would be the last time I visited this place. It would only make sense to record as much as possible. \n\nIt was then I remembered my body cam. I took it off its mount and checked to make sure it was still on. The power light shone green and the record light glowed red. I checked the battery and recording space and found around an hour left for my exploration.\n\nI had no desire to check the video now. I was sure I’d be seeing those critters again soon enough. \n\nBut what really bothered me were the bones. Why wouldn’t they just bury them? What about the families of all those people? Did they know their remains were down here in someone’s basement, dumped like trash?\n\nI couldn’t imagine the people of the town knew about this. There would’ve been a major uproar. Could this be why the place was shut down? Did someone investigate and discover it, then quietly cover it up to prevent a scandal?\n\nI looked down the brick hallway. \n\nThe only way to get answers was to find them myself. \n\nAnd what about that old man I’d seen on the street? The way he smiled… Did he know all about this? Did he know what I would find? Had he gone to tell someone that I was creeping around in their dirty little secret? Would he send someone to stop me, or even worse, disappear me like all the people whose bones now lay forgotten in a pile of garbage?\n\nAs if reading my thoughts, I heard a sound in the distance. It wasn’t loud. Like a stone had fallen or been kicked by someone too focused on sneaking up on me to notice it.\n\nMy senses went on high alert. I reached into my backpack and pulled out a can of pepper spray. Why I didn’t have it out long ago, I’m not sure. Perhaps I was too focused on exploration to be concerned about safety. A pain in my back reinforced that conclusion.\n\nI did a slow pan in a circle looking all around the room. It was also dirty from years of disuse. I wished for more light. My headlamp was bright enough for normal circumstances, but in this underground labyrinth where light hadn’t been seen for untold years, my lamp was woefully underpowered. Every time I turned, shadows jumped and danced, making my anxiety run rampant. \n\nAs strange as it sounded, those small rodent-like creatures gave me hope. At least I knew there was breathable air down here. Otherwise, they would’ve died long ago. I wondered what they were feeding on. Cleaning the last shred of meat from bones would only last for so long. I wondered if they weren’t afraid of the light if they would’ve found me to be a lovely little snack.\n\nAt the moment, they seemed to be satisfied with hiding, but I could feel their eyes, and I knew that if the chance came, fresh meat would be a tantalizing temptation. Perhaps even enough to overcome fear of the light.\n\nWith this in mind, I did a reevaluation of my priorities. The way back to the main part of the hospital was very far, and I wasn’t sure if I could find the triggers to open the walls. Also, I wondered if my tumble into the basement had destroyed the stairs to get back up.\n\nMy choices were limited. Either I start down the brick hallway or go back into the bone room. \n\nI still heard the call of exploring the unknown, but with every new danger that arose the volume decreased. \n\nI started down the brick hallway, but slower than before. Every opening caused concern. Every sound, apprehension. The sounds were increasing by degrees. As if I was approaching the lively center of this dark and desolate place.\n\nAs tempted as I was to explore rooms as they emerged, I didn’t do more than pop my head in and take a picture. The quick glances showed them all to be rather similar. They were empty rooms with a drain in the middle of the floor. The doors were made of solid metal that had rusted and had a small viewport with metal bars. At the bottom of each door, there was an opening wide enough to slide a food tray in, but the rooms had no beds, no sinks, no toilets. If they were cells, they were quite inhumane.\n\nI continued down the hallway, keeping on guard for anything that might jump out at me, while at the same time being drawn by the sound. \n\nAfter a few minutes of walking, and not seeing anything, my nerves were shot. I was so anticipating an attack that the lack of one made things that much worse. \n\nFinally, the sound got so loud I knew the source had to be right around the corner. Sure enough, I came to a turn in the hallway and there was my culprit. Water falling from far above and splashing into a puddle on the floor. \n\nIt must’ve been doing it for a long time because there was an impression worn into the floor where the puddle permanently resided.\n\nWhen I rounded the corner, several of the critters scattered upon seeing the light. \n\nI stepped around the puddle and continued down the hallway. It was strange hearing the sound recede. Like I had made a great discovery and then immediately abandoned it. \n\nI came to a long circular ramp that went up to the next floor. I worked my way down this new hall until I came to a room that made me wish I’d never taken a vacation.\n\nIt was a large room, but very dirty. Unlike the other rooms in the basement hallways, this one had furnishings. There was a large cage that was round with metal slats and looked like it had just enough room to hold an adult. I knew this because there was a skeleton inside. \n\nThe legs had slipped out of the bottom and one of the feet was missing. The rest was piled at the bottom of the cage where the poor unfortunate soul must’ve died and been left there to rot.\n\nI nearly wretched at the thought of being left to die in such a horrible way. \n\nThe rest of the room was furnished as well. With a rack, an Iron Maiden, and a strange contraption that had a pyramid sitting on top of a pole. \n\nOne other thing the room had was my missing gurney. It was sitting off in the corner rusting to pieces. One of the wheels had fallen off and the other three looked like they were close behind. \n\nOn the wall opposite the furnishings were three large openings. I looked through one and saw the pile of dirty bones in the room below where I had first entered.\n\nBut the next room held an even bigger shock. The room was large like the previous one but filled with occult images. On the floor was a large star with many smaller symbols near the points. There were many spots where dark stains covered sections of the floor.\n\nThere was an altar of some kind at the far end, but I had no desire to see it.\n\nI went through that room as quickly as possible. So fast that I nearly ran into the ladder. \n\nIt was the only option. The hallway just ended at a ladder. I shone my light up but couldn’t see the top. It was once again decision time.\n\n‘In for a penny, in for a pound,’ I thought. \n\nBut my mind was screaming to turn around and go back. At this point, I don’t think I could turn back without finding what was at the end of this parade of nightmares. \n\nI grabbed the ladder and gave it a tug. It seemed to hold, and no rust fell so I began the climb. Partway up I took a break and shone my light toward the top. This time I could see something very faintly. It was nice to have a goal to aim for. \n\nI climbed until my arms and legs felt like Jell-O. Finally, I felt something bump against my head. I looked up to find a trapdoor. I pushed against it, but it barely budged. After a few minutes of trying more desperately each time, I finally managed to push the trapdoor up enough to crawl out. \n\nAs soon as I was free it snapped back shut. I lay on the floor breathing hard from my vertical journey. After a few minutes, I gathered myself and got up to find out where I was. I looked around the room and it seemed to be the secluded corner of a storeroom. There were shelves full of copy paper, tablets, pencils, and other standard office supplies.\n\nI went to the door and out into what looked like a modern office. There was a large desk sitting in front of a wall of old books. I looked around searching for the way out and found another door. \n\nI stepped out into the sanctuary of an old, high ceilinged, church. The windows were beautiful artworks of stained glass, showing religious scenes. The pulpit was ornate, and the pipe organ was massive. \n\nI stepped down from the stage wondering at the fantastic condition everything seemed to be preserved in for an abandoned church. \n\nAnd then I saw the people sitting there. It wasn’t a lot, only a person here and there in the pews, but at the back of the church, staring at me and smiling, was the old man.\n\nI walked down the center aisle drawing looks from people in the pews. I pulled off my mask and smiled my most apologetic smile as I walked to the back. \n\n“Enjoy your trip?” the old man said when I got to him.\n\n“Not really,” I said. “What do you know about it?”\n\nHe smiled and motioned me to follow him.\n\nWe went outside and I was surprised to find the old hospital I’d broken into, what seemed like an eternity ago, in the distance and downhill from where I stood.\n\nThe old man followed my line of sight.\n\n“It doesn’t seem like it’s that far until you walk it.”\n\nHe sat down on the top step and I sat beside him.\n\n“Who are you?” I said.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n“I used to work there, a long time ago,” he said pointing at the hospital. “I was the one who delivered them to the dungeon.”\n\n“You knew what went on in the upper level?”\n\nHe hung his head.\n\n“As much as I would love to tell you no, it would be a lie,” he said. “I took them where they needed to go and put them in whatever holding room until they were called for.”\n\n“And who called them?”\n\n“Who do you think?” he said turning and looking at the front of the church.\n\n“You can’t tell me that the priests… “\n\n“Of course. They did ungodly things to those people,” he said with a far-off look. “You should’ve heard the screams. Constantly, night and day.”\n\n“But how could they get away with it?” I said. “There would be some paper trail, some record of people being in the hospital.”\n\n“You might be surprised,” he said. “This was long before humane rules were in place. If a patient came to our hospital, it was because they had done something awful, and sending them to prison would be a death sentence, or their families dropped them off because they could no longer handle them.”\n\nMy jaw fell open.\n\n“People would just drop off sons and daughters like they were stray cats being taken to the pound?”\n\nHe nodded slowly.\n\n“Unbelievable,” I said.\n\n“Is it really? Think about our modern disposable society. If it’s too much trouble, get rid of it.”\n\n“I see your point, but this was decades ago. Back when people still cared.”\n\n“But also before a lot of mental illnesses were understood. People became convinced that their loved ones were crazy, or even demon-possessed.”\n\n“So they brought them to the church,” I said blankly.\n\n“And the church took them with open arms. Saying they would do the best they could, but never mentioning what would really happen.”\n\n“What did really happen?”\n\n“You were in the rooms, what do you think happened?”\n\n“I saw the torture chamber, but why?”\n\n“To release the sickness from their souls,” he said raising his arms theatrically. “That’s what the priests would have you believe.”\n\n“And what was the real reason?”\n\n“Because there are some sick individuals in this world, and some of them try to mask their sickness in the garb of a holy man.”\n\n“They did it for their own pleasure,” I said closing my eyes, not wanting to believe it.\n\n“Among other things.”\n\n“Such as?”\n\n“You saw the pentagram.”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Sometimes the devil can fool you into thinking he’s an angel,” he said, then chuckled. “Which, of course, he was at one point.”\n\nHis chuckle made me raise an eyebrow.\n\n“Are you a religious man?”\n\n“Let’s just say I used to be.”\n\n“Seeing things like that changed your viewpoint?”\n\nHe looked me straight in the eye.\n\n“You can’t imagine the things I’ve seen.”\n\nIt sent chills down my spine.\n\n“So they actually performed… ?”\n\n“Human sacrifice rituals.”\n\n“But why?”\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n“Who knows? It’s like anything, once you justify it there is no guilty conscious about it.”\n\n“That isn’t as illuminating as I’d like.”\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n“Why did you break into the hospital today?”\n\nI cringed.\n\n“Don’t worry, I won’t call the police or anything,” he said. “I’m just curious.”\n\n“I guess I wanted to see for myself.”\n\n“Maybe that’s the same reason the priests started doing things in the basement so long ago. They were curious.”\n\n“Maybe… “ I said allowing my thoughts to drift back to ancient times.\n\nThe old man watched me with a little grin on his face.\n\n“You never answered me,” I said when I saw him staring. “Who are you?”\n\n“Oh, I’m nobody who used to be somebody,” he said slowly getting up. I tried to help him but he waved me off.\n\n“That still doesn’t answer my question.”\n\n“No, it doesn’t, does it?” he said with that little grin. “I’ll see you around, kid.”\n\nAnd with that, he started down the hill.\n\n“Can I help you, son?” came a voice behind me.\n\nI whipped around, startled, and found a little priest standing there. He wasn’t very tall and had thinning grey hair.\n\n“No thanks, father,” I said. “I was just talking to this old man here.”\n\n“What old man?” he said.\n\nI looked and the old man was gone. I stood and turned all around. There was no way he could’ve gotten down the hill already, it was a half mile away. I looked to see if maybe he’d fallen, but he was just gone.\n\n“He was here a minute ago.”\n\n“Son, I don’t know how to tell you this,” the old priest said. “But you’ve been sitting out here alone for fifteen minutes talking to yourself. I watched to see if you were ok.”\n\nHe pointed toward the church and there was an open window that he must’ve looked through.\n\n“That can’t be,” I said mostly to myself.\n\nHe smiled and put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n“You wouldn’t be the first to be confused about things,” he said. “Why don’t you come back inside, and we’ll talk. Maybe I can help you.”\n\nI looked down at the grin on his face. On the surface, it seemed friendly, but knowing what was beneath the church…\n\n“No thanks, father,” I said. “I think I’ll go back to my nice safe truck.”\n\nI started down the hill with a fresh perspective on life. I mean it’s not every day you find out the things I have. And as for the old man… \n\nWhen I walked past the hospital I looked up at the second-story window I’d seen him through, I swore I saw a fleeting glimpse of someone looking out at me.\n\nI stepped a little faster heading for my car.\n\nWhen I got home and reviewed the footage from my body cam, I found the priest was right. There was no old man, I was sitting there talking to myself. There was a strange fluctuation when I would look at where the old man should have been, like heat waves in the desert.\n\nI never came back to explore my hometown.\n\nSome things are better left alone.",

        "text": "When I was eight, my cousin and I were best friends. I would go to his house every week and play Nintendo 64 with him for hours. About twenty-three years ago, I did this for the last time.\n\nAfter school, my mom picked me up and drove me to my cousin's house. Our parents had organized a sleepover for us, so I was extremely excited. After a five-minute drive there, my cousin and I greeted each other. We immediately started talking about Mario while playing WWF War Zone and drinking Mountain Dew. After a few hours of this, we both got bored. I was pouring a bowl of Goldfish when my cousin said, \"Wanna play hide and seek?\"\n\nI said yes and my cousin started counting down from twenty. I glanced around and found a great hiding spot right next to a window. I was silently chuckling to myself when I saw something outside. It was a tall and shadowy figure. I looked at it in confusion and it looked back at me. It started waving. It had no eyes, mouth, or nose and it had grey skin. I was staring at it in terror when I heard something from behind me. My cousin yelled, \"I found you!\" I replied, \"Dude, you scared me!\" I looked at my cousin and quickly looked back at the window, but the creature was gone.\n\nThroughout the rest of the night, I was supposed to be having fun, but I couldn't. I couldn't forget what I had just seen. While we were eating dinner, my cousin noticed that I seemed a bit down. He said, \"What's wrong?\" I told him, \"Nothing. I'm fine.\" When I said this, I looked up at him and saw the monster from earlier looming behind him. I screamed, \"Behind you!\" He quickly turned around and saw nothing. The thing had just disappeared. \"You tricked me!\" is what he said. He thought I was joking. I replied in a shaky voice, \"No, there was something behind you. I'm not kidding, I swear.\" His happy expression turned into a confused one. In a weirded-out tone, he said, \"Ok?\"\n\nWe watched some TV for a while when my cousin said, \"Truth or dare?\" I replied, \"Dare.\" He told me, \"Go outside without a coat for one minute.\" It was in the middle of January, so the ground was covered in snow. I didn't want to be a wuss, so I agreed to this. I stepped into the freezing snow and my cousin started counting down. To my horror, the thing was out there with me. It stomped toward me and looked me in the eyes. For about thirty seconds, it stared at me. I tried making words, but I couldn't. I was frozen. In a deep and gravelly voice, it said, \"Do not worry. You are safe for now.\" I could hear my cousin say, \"Fifty-eight! Fifty-nine! Sixty! You're done!\" He opened the door and said, \"Come in!\" The monster had disappeared again. I slowly tiptoed to the house and came inside. I plopped down on a chair and didn't say a word.\n\nI was scared. I thought, \"What if that thing hurts somebody?\" I sat down for about half an hour before finally deciding that I needed to tell my cousin about what I had just seen. I came up to him and told him everything, but he thought I was lying to him. He angrily said, \"Why are you lying? You don't have to come up with a fake story to impress me.\" I kept trying to convince him that I was telling the truth, but he ignored me. After a few minutes, he lashed out at me and said, \"I'll prove that your lying.\" He proceeded to go outside. I told him, \"Don't go outside!\" He said, \"See? There's no monster. Now stop l-\"\n\nHe randomly stopped talking. I went outside and looked for him, but he was gone. I told his parents that he was gone, and they looked for him for hours. Hours turned into days and days turned into months. Months turned into years and years turned into decades. If anybody thinks that they've seen an adult version of Jeremy Bianco, please tell his family. They miss him very much.",

        "text": "Now there is a rule here on this subreddit that everything must be assumed to be true, but you can corroborate this yourself.\n\nThere is a light in the sky above Cordoba, Argentina. I am here on a volunteer service trip. Go outside, right now, if you are in Cordoba, or maybe even just Argentina, and look straight up. There is something in the sky.\n\nIt's moving erratically. Like a drone, or a weather balloon. At first I thought it was a plane. But it's been up there for hours, so it is not a drone. It could be a weather balloon. Could be. But it stays in the same general area, below the cloud level (I don't know if weather balloons go below the clouds or not) and it doesn't go outside of this general area in the center of the sky, like it is tethered to something. There's a different reason I don't think it's a weather balloon.\n\nIt's sickening. I don't mean that metaphorically. It is sickening to observe. When you look at it long enough, your ears start to ring. Like in the movies when there is a flashbang, but at a much lower volume. Then the dizziness. You feel increasingly woozy. Then the absolute dread. The feeling of primal terror.\n\nThe feelings this light in the sky causes are abject discomfort. You feel like you are looking down the barrel of a gun, like this light is ready to explode, or come crashing down at you, any moment. The dread paired with it is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I have seen the worst horrors of life. I promise you. Every terrible thing you can imagine on the dark web (Funkytown and more). This feeling is incomparable.\n\nIt makes you think the world is going to end. Like you are walking alone in the woods with no communication and no weapons and you have noticed a mountain lion stalking you. You feel as if you are going to be violently torn apart.\n\nI'm not the only one. I had my housemates come look, and each and every one became upset or angry with me that I asked them to look. They all said they regret it. They all went inside when the feelings of terror arrived.\n\nSo why keep looking? This is where I need your help, /r/nosleep. It is spelling something. It is fucking creating letters and numbers with its flight path. I can't tell what because I can't get it on my phone camera, and looking at it too long makes me feel like I must drown myself in the pool in front of me. Someone needs to go out and record this, because in all my years alive and of all the things I have experienced and witnessed, this is something else. It's like it's worse than a vengeful God, or aliens, or cosmic horrors. It is like looking into the eyes of pure torture and hate.\n\nI am going to bed. I will try and provide updates. Somehow, though, I'm worried if I sleep tonight, I will never wake again.",

        "text": "The children started showing up about a month or two ago, the boys and girls both dressed the same. Bright red shirts and white pants. Clean tennis shoes. Some of them looked as old as ten. Others as young as eight. They were unfailingly polite as they circulated the neighborhood, passing out their pamphlets.\n\n*Have you ever wanted to start over?* they would ask.\n\n*Have you made missteps in your life that you wish you could erase?*\n\nI looked down on people who let the children in. It showed a kind of weakness, an inability to fix your own mistakes. \n\nThen I got in an accident at work. I’d been trying to fix the gears of a broken belt when my manager turned the power back on. By the time someone hit the kill switch, three of my fingers had come clean off, and the thumb and pinky were mangled past recognition.\n\nI found myself spending my days at home, popping pain meds and watching daytime TV, punctuated by the occasional call from lawyers or my insurance company. Already, the writing was on the wall: the accident had been my fuckup. The company would fight me to the last dollar.\n\nI’d just hurled my phone into a wall when I heard the knock at the door. I opened it to see two of the children there, a boy and a girl. They stared at my bloodshot eyes, the bloody wrap around my hand.\n\n“Have you ever wanted to be whole again?” asked the boy.\n\n“Where are your parents?” I asked. “Do they wait in the car or something?”\n\n“Our mother is always close,” said the girl.\n\nThey handed me a pamphlet full of promises of rebirth.\n\n“Everything wrong can be righted,” said the boy. “All the bad can be burnt away.”\n\nMaybe they’d just caught me at a weak point. Maybe I just needed to get out of the house. Either way, somehow I found myself at a large house a few miles outside the city limits a few days later.\n\nOthers like me had gathered too. Addicts. Bearded vets with blank or shifty eyes. Some came in wheelchairs or hobbling with canes. Guys so fat that they struggled to walk up the house’s front stairs.\n\nInside, twenty or more of the children waited. They had woven garlands of red flowers, and as we approached they asked us to kneel. The flowers were some kind of red lily I’d never seen before, completely without scent. A couple of people noped out right then and there, heading right back to their cars. But not me. \n\n*Welcome to your rebirth,* said a small girl as she placed the flowers around my neck.\n\nMy hand was throbbing and my meds were already starting to wear off. For a second, I considered running back to the car to reup my dose, but the crowd was flowing into the house, and I didn’t want to be left behind.\n\nFinally, we arrived in a large ballroom with a stage at the far side. The room was decorated with dozens of photos, all black, red, and orange, and when I stopped to look more closely, I saw that it was a house on fire. \n\n“That was two summers ago,” said the small girl. “One of his first works. Many were taken to the Mother that day.”\n\nAs she said it, the doors I’d entered closed, and a pair of children moved in front of them, blocking the way out.\n\nThen, on the stage, a young boy appeared. He wore red robes and appeared older than the other children, maybe 12 or 13. He gestured for us to approach. As we did, he paced the stage, beginning his sermon.\n\n“I was once like you,” he said, his voice echoing through the room as we plodded toward him. “Everything was taken from me. And that’s when I found out just how our city cares for the weak and destitute. I was placed in a home where the other boys beat and threatened me. Where my so-called caretakers turned a blind eye. I’m guessing you all have stories like this. It’s why you’re here. Because the winners aren’t looking to start over. They’re looking to stay in charge.”\n\n“Fuck yeah!” shouted one of the wheelchair bound men beside me. \n\n“I might have died there, in that sad house in the country, but salvation found me, just as I hope it finds you today,” said the boy.\n\nWith that, he pressed a button, and two large panels in the ceiling opened to reveal the sky above. At the same time, another panel opened on the floor below, and a panel lifted up from below. The panel was perhaps fifteen feet long and three feet wide, covered in smooth, black rocks.\n\n“Sir,” said the boy, leaping off stage, and approaching a morbidly obese man. “How long has it been since you felt whole and happy?”\n\nThe man shook his head, mouthing “Never.”\n\n“And you, ma’am?” he approached a frail, meth-addicted, skinny woman who could have been 30 or 50. Impossible to tell thanks to her blotchy skin and toothless mouth.\n\n“Years ago,” she said. \n\n“Be whole,” said the boy, and he reached over and kissed her filthy forehead.\n\n“Am I… better now?” she asked, but the boy shook his head.\n\n“Make no mistake,” he said, \"I am here to offer miracles. But they are not without sacrifice. You must be brave if you wish to join me. Can any of you be brave, I wonder? Just for a minute? But it must be a whole minute.”\n\nWith that, he reached into his pocket and removed some sort of rock. As I watched, the rock began to glow. Suddenly, the line of rocks burst into flame. Even twenty feet away, the heat was intense enough to make me sweat.\n\nI took a step back, moving toward the wall. I looked back at the door, but there were at least six children there now. My heart throbbed in my head. I wanted nothing more than to sprint back to the car and grab my pill bottle. I found myself shaking, despite the heat.\n\nAround me, the children knelt and reached their arms up toward the fire.\n\n“Hail the Mother,” they intoned. “Hail the womb of fire.”\n\nThe little girl who’d given me the flowers stood and spoke.\n\n“My name is Angie, and this is my testimony. I was a mother once, of three beautiful children. But I was a drinker, and in time, I chose the bottle over my family. They went to live with my husband’s family, and I started drinking myself to death. When the Mother found me, I was ready to die. But the Mother embraced me, and now I am fresh and new.”\n\nA small boy stood up.\n\n“I am Diego. I lost both of my legs in a car accident when I was forty. My own fault, driving drunk on the freeway. I tried to kill myself twice. I’m sure I would have succeeded eventually, but then the Mother found me, and I was reborn.”\n\nThe lead boy gestured to the side of the room, and a door opened. In walked an old woman shaking with palsy. She wore a white gown, hung loosely at her bony shoulders.\n\n“After each session, we send one Witness back into the world,” said the boy. “Someone who has seen the miracle and who can serve as a fresh example for the rest of you. Last week, June here witnessed the Mother’s kiss with her own eyes. Now she’s here to prove it to the rest of you. You see, unlike some religions, we don’t rely on faith. We let you witness miracles with your own eyes.”\n\nJune approach the fire. As she did, she loosened a string around the top of her gown and let it fall to the ground, revealing her old, naked body. Then she took a deep breath and began walking forward, into the fire.\n\n“Stop!” I shouted, but she didn’t react. Instead, she kept walking forward.\n\nShe screamed as her foot touched the first rock. The skin of her legs turned black, bubbling and hissing filling the air with the smell of bacon. Her hair lit up like pine needles in a firepit. Still, she kept stepping forward, even as she shrieked. \n\n“What the fuck?” someone screamed. Other people were starting to back away. But most of us couldn’t take our eyes away.\n\nFinally, even June’s scream disappeared, as her face melted and her lungs caught fire. \n\nBut she didn’t stop walking. \n\nLittle more than a skeleton, June continued moving through the fire, step after step, until even her very bones seemed to disappear.\n\nThe room was silent. Then, someone shouted, pointing. We looked at the far side of the fire from where she’d entered and saw a child emerge from the flames. The child touched her face with her own soft hands, shrieking with glee. Then one of the other children ran up to throw a blanket around her.\n\n“June is reborn!” shouted the head boy. “Praise be to the Mother!” \n\nAs the children repeated him, he turned to the rest of us, and gestured to the flames.\n\n“And now the chance is yours,” he shouted. “Enter now and be reborn. Or leave and forget. Yes, indeed, we have a way of making you forget you ever entered here. Of forgetting the wonders you’ve seen. But make no mistake, you will never be invited back.”\n\nNervous conversation filled the room as the boy looked at us one by one, trying to meet our eyes.\n\n“Who has a fire in his heart?” he asked. “Who wishes to accept the gift?”\n\nFinally, a large man next to me raised his hand.\n\n“I do,” he said. “I want another shot.”\n\nThe boy took his hand and led him to the fire. For a moment, they both stared in at it.\n\n“You will walk forward,” he said. “The flames will lick you clean. Make no mistake, there will be pain. All cleansing comes with a little pain. There may even be a point when you think you can’t go on. But you must not waver. Do not turn from the path. The Mother deals harshly with those who reject her kiss.”\n\nThe fat man began to strip, taking off all of his clothes until he stood fully nude before us. His distorted body glowed strangely in the orange light of the flames, like something out of a nightmare, a man made of melted wax.\n\n“Go forth,” said the boy. \n\nThe large man began to walk forward, screaming as the rocks melted the bottom of his skin. He took another step. Then another. But as he moved, his steps became slower, less sure. For a moment, he looked out at me, meeting my gaze with his melting eyes.\n\nAnd then he tried to jump out.\n\nSomething terrible happened as he leapt from the flames. The fire followed him, wrapping around him like a blanket. It wouldn’t let him leave. He ran toward me, the flames licking him, his burbling fat boiling off his bones and smelling of burnt grease. Finally, he collapsed and my feet, a charred husk.\n\nA woman screamed. People started to rush for the doors.\n\n“He strayed!” shouted the lead boy. “I told him what would happen if he strayed! I ask you to search your own heart. Ask yourself: am I strong enough? Strong enough to endure a short minute of pain to gain a lifetime!”\n\n“Fuck this,” said one of the tweaker girls. “I ain’t exactly a strong willed type.”\n\nThe lead boy waved to one of the children by the back doors. The child threw them open, gesturing for the crowd to leave. Most of them did, muttering to themselves. As they went, the child reached up a finger, touching each softly on the forehead. \n\nUltimately, only seven of us remained.\n\n“Line up,” commanded the lead boy, and we did. \n\nAnd then we took our turns. The next guy, a scraggly old guy covered in tattoos from his wrists to his face, ran into the fire, trying to get it over with fast. He ended up falling face first into the rocks, screaming in agony. But he didn’t stray. He crawled the rest of the way, even after his arms had melted off. And when he emerged, he was nine years old again, his skin wiped clean, his eyes bright.\n\nThe next three didn’t make it. Nothing as dramatic as the fat man, but just as horrible. I’ll never forget their screams.\n\nAfter that, a couple of junkies held hands and ran together. One was about to make it, when her friend tried to pull her back. But then the first one shook free and emerged as a child. Her friend ended up a lump of charcoal in the middle of the room.\n\nFinally, it was my turn. \n\n“Wait,” said the lead boy. “Not you. You are the Witness. In one week, you’ll come back here, knowing all that you do. You’ll enter the flames and emerge reborn, just as June did earlier today, proving to a whole new group that our miracles are real.”\n\nI nodded, not saying a word.\n\nSince that day, I’ve been sitting in my living room, counting the days. My hand throbs, and I pop pain pills. The phone rings, and I ignore it. Every night, I dream of fire.\n\nThe children visit daily, sometimes peeking in through the windows. There are many more of them in my neighborhood than before. Perhaps they’re worried I’ll try to run away.\n\nI have never had a strong threshold for pain or a strong will. I’m a weak man. But I want so badly to be reborn, to have another chance. \n\nIn the dreams, I see a great bird at the heart of the flames, its burning eyes fixed on me with indifference. And I ask her to be gentle when I enter her domain, to take my pain away.\n\nAnd the great bird laughs and laughs and laughs.",

        "text": "It started with packing. I hate moving. My parents are in the middle of a divorce, making my stress levels worse than they already are. I live in a two-story house with a big backyard that leads to a forest or creek, whatever you call it. \n\nMy mom is packing up our supplies for when we move out. She was done packing the stuff in her room, closet, and bathroom. She was about done packing up the stuff in my baby sisters' room. I never liked their room. It made me feel uncomfortable anytime I walked near it or was in it. I felt as though I was being watched.\n\nI heard sounds coming from inside of it, and assumed it was my mom packing up the last bit of toys or clothes, logical thinking. I peeked inside and saw nobody. I thought. My sisters had the type of closet that has sliding doors and then inside, a rod across the top for hanging clothes. I thought I saw some clothes that my mom had forgotten to take out when she finished.\n\nI had to squint to be able to see into the closet -- I never wear my glasses, like I'm supposed to. Still couldn't get a clear view of what was there. I walked closer and I saw it. It was a tall, shadowy, figure. Its eyes were white, with no pupil, iris, nothing. Yet I still had the feeling that it was staring at me. I never should have looked into its eyes.\n\nAfter that, I saw it more often, until I started seeing it every. single. day. I dreaded waking up in the morning because I knew I would see it standing there, at the foot of my bed. Once I sat up, it would disappear. It never did anything to harm me, but that didn't stop me from feeling uneasy when I felt it there.\n\nIt started affecting my everyday life. On the days I would go to school, I would see it standing across the road from my bus stop, the front of the school building, and the back of classrooms. I would tell my friends about it being there, beside them, but they never noticed. They didn't feel anything or see anything.\n\nThe only way I can escape it is by sleeping. I've started sleeping during class, which lead to me being sent down to the nurse to take naps from time to time. I sleep after school, I sleep the whole weekend, and I slept as much as I could. Then it started appearing in my dreams, now nightmares.\n\nIt's following me. I've never seen it move. It only stood there. I can't get the image out of my head. When it moves it tangles its body and glitches across the floor, it's not the best explanation but it's the only way I can word it. It hasn't gotten too close, it stays at least a couple of feet away minimum. It moves from the dark corner beside my dresser to the side of the bed that I'm farthest from.\n\nI feel as though it is going through stages of comfort, it only started moving after months of standing around me. Again, months later after the moving stage, it's getting closer. It sits on my bed. It sits in my bus seat, on the edge. It watches me eat. It won't leave me alone.\n\nIt can run. It doesn't just teleport in areas like it used to. It stands by my side and then follows me wherever I go. No matter how fast I run around my house to exercise, it always matches my pace. I can't escape. The only way I've ever lost it was when I went on a road trip with my mom and siblings.\n\nIt lost track of me when I changed my routine, usually I eat breakfast, then run down the stairs, but this time I just ran. It wasn't expecting it. I found its weakness. It was too slow. I made it. I just wish I didn't have to go back home. I've kept my same routine, breakfast then stairs, to be prepared when I do escape.\n\nToday is the day. Today is when I run away forever and it finally leaves me alone. I skipped breakfast and ran. I ran as fast as I could. I ran down the road. It was confused, but it stayed far behind me. Or I thought. I looked back and I saw it sitting there, just sitting. I thought it could only match my pace, I looked forward and there it was. It was faster. I hate it. It stood up. This time it was... bigger. Bigger than I remember. It towered over me.\n\nIt stared down at me. I couldn't do anything, I was paralyzed from shock. I just glared back at it. It put out its hand and touched me. It. touched. me. Then disappeared. I don't know what happened, I hope this doesn't affect me or ruin me.\n\nI don't remember seeing it much after the incident. I am still dreading the day that I do see it again, I feel that it won't end well for me. I don't feel the need to write about it anymore.\n\nMy body feels different. I don't remember being this short. I don't remember being noticed by multiple people. I don't remember looking in the mirror and seeing the reflection of a teenage girl.",

        "text": "In the old days, those in my profession wore a mask. Some say that it's so no one comes for revenge. Others say that it was so God doesn't recognize it as a sin. Still, I have heard that it is so death doesn't come for the wrong killer.\n\nLong gone are the days of axes, and it has been almost 50 years since even France used a guillotine. Instead, in my home state, we prefer the electric chair. And I am the hand that pulls the lever. A modern day executioner.\n\nWhat they don't report on killing criminals, is the tow that is inflicted on those who sentenced him there. The lawyers, the judge, the jury, and none more so than the one who pulls the lever. There's the guilt for some executioners. The toiling abyss, and uncertainty that plague some cases. And even the most die hard amongst us, never know when something will trigger our subconscious.\n\nI once met a colleague who pulled the big one over a mother who killed her two sons. She claimed they were demons. Because she only prayed for daughters. And pulling the lever on someone like that normally didn't keep any of us awake.\n\nBut my colleague told me, it was what the woman said while she was sitting there screaming as a hundred thousand jolts lit her nervous system up like a Christmas tree, that got him.\n\n\"It smells like cheeseburgers,\" he told me. \"Before her body went limp. And sure. You know. There's a little smoke. But I thought that was that. Until a couple days later. My wife and kids come home with McDonalds. And I was fine when I ate a fry. Even had a bit of their milkshake. But when I started unwrapping one of the cheeseburgers. I suddenly smelled it. Of that that woman cooking. It crawled out of some recess in my brain, and out of my nose. I could even taste it in my mouth.\" He shakes his head, \"I haven't been able to touch the stuff since.\"\n\nThen there were the conferences. It started as a kind of support group. After Leslie McNeal passed away. Those who knew her, said she wasn't the same after bringing it down on this Satanist in the tri-state area.\n\nEddie who was in the room at the time, as an alternate, confirmed that it was true. That the Satanist cursed Leslie as he died. But it was after the fact, that caused outrage from our community. When she went to stop the juice, the electricity jumped and the amps became unstable.\n\nSee, there's a safety feature on the newer models. A light that warns the executioner if the leads are hot, meaning that the system's been overcharged and has caused the lever to be live. But most states still got them rinky dink ones built in the late 1800s, without any of the fail safes.\n\nHell, \"Old Sparky\" down in Kentucky is over a hundred years old and still active.\n\nAnd so we originally gathered to levy our grievances. To get those in charge to make a much needed change. But most of our push back came in the form of threats. That they'd tear the entire program down and switch to lethal injections. Put us all out of work, as none of us were qualified medical professionals. So we kept our mouths shut publicly, in want of a $3.29 cent part I see often at hardware stores.\n\nWell, the lack of that part sent Leslie to the hospital. Put her out for weeks. And she lost her right arm because of it. From near the elbow, down.\n\nAnd I've personally never met her. But I suppose what she said after the accident, is why people believe she was cursed.\n\nIt was Eddie Croquette and then committee leader Jo Jones who heard it from her own lips.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she kept screaming. \"Oh God. Jo. It's so scared!\"\n\n\"What is,\" Jo demanded. Eddie said the two were nearly shouting at this time because Leslie was screaming and moaning, groaning about the pain.\n\n\"My hand! My HAND,\" she shouted. \"It keeps signing, from my hand!\"\n\nH.\n\nE.\n\nL.\n\nL.\n\n\"\n\nH.E.L.L. H.E.L.L. H.E.L.L.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWild theories after that. A lot of at home accidents from fanatic groups, as electricity use in occults started resurged.\n\nAnd I sometimes wondered about the mysticism of it myself. It's difficult not to have some sort of obsession with volts and amps, or Tesla coils while in this field. For instance, when electric cars were commercialized, I embraced them. Watches. Books on my kindle. It seems like such an odd thing to say for someone in such an archaic profession, but it is true.\n\nThat was until it happened to me.\n\nWhat was the biggest criminal case of my life, turned into one of pure terror. But I suppose I can't properly tell that story. Not really. Not without telling the accounts of Jennifer Tooley. As the story of the Body Count murderer and hers intertwine. Although, I don't know where the truth begins and the lies end.\n\nAfter her death, Jennifer Tooley's live stream went viral. She was a budding journalist on this side of the Sierra Nevada. An all valley kind of girl. Beautiful, young, and full of Po. Ten. Tail. The uncouth internet dubbed her, due to her smash or pass rate.\n\n(And the media asks us if we're going to hell for killing God's children)\n\nSo the live stream follows her to a lake, but it was the posts before it all that started the trouble.\n\nShe captioned: Tonight I met a man. Though he claimed to be something more. But isn't that what they all say?\n\nAnd the photo she posted with it reached over a million likes before the sensitivity panel on the social media platform took it down. I'm sure it can still be found through other avenues, such as thewaybackmachine or 4Chan or something. Perhaps on Reddit.\n\nBut that photo became famous because it was the only clear picture of the murderer before his incarceration. It were as if before the photo, the man never even existed. We couldn't find him in any of our records. And no one came forth then or since, to claim him as kin.\n\nThe live stream was mostly blurry footage as Jennifer Tooley swam. And it's worth mentioning that Tooley was a swimmer at the collegiate level. But it wasn't important because the video shows her screaming and splashing, horror stuck in her throat as she struggled to breathe after every stroke. She was far from shore, and everything was shaking. But there are a few glimpses of her looking back, and seeing the man she was with. The one who claimed to be otherworldly. He was standing near the beach house at first. But then he began walking. On top of the water after her. She turns again, screaming. Swimming. And looks back one more time. As he comes to stand next to her. Crouches. And says, \"Do not be afraid.\"\n\nThen nothing. That was it. A manhunt ensued but no other signs or traces could be found.\n\nThat was when the public really started exploding. It's that way for many cases I've witnessed. Once the truth runs out, and the straws are being grasped, is when criminals turn from murderers into household names.\n\nIt started with a few frat boys out in Davis, said they recognized him at one of their parties. They couldn't provide any proof, and after some digging it seemed they were trying to ruin the good Bruin name, as a football rivalry began to churn between the two schools. None of it mattered. As it didn't stop people from booing in the stadiums, even going far as to say they'd withdraw their kid if they were attending UCLA.\n\nRumors swirled. He was spotted at an ice cream parlor here. Or a restaurant there. That it was all fake news and propaganda to distract the public from a larger issue with our economy.\n\nSo that by the time he came up for trial. Everything was up in the air. No one could get a good grasp of the situation, as even hardcore zeitgeists claimed that this man, the murderer, was the new prophet. Some even going as far to call him Jesus, stating that this was the coming foretold.\n\nThe evidence that weren't released to the public, stopped all of that. Quelled the noise. What he did to that poor girl. Holding her under the water. Dragging her back to shore. The pictures of her chopped up, hanging on a hook in that old cabin, the look of life still in her eyes as he made her smile for the camera. It was too much.\n\nThe state sentenced the man without a name, to death by electric chair.\n\nAnd in October I was called in. I knew it was coming. So I had been eating well, getting a lot of sleep, and trying my best to stay in a good head space, as I was asked to pull the lever on this monster. I agreed, only if Eddie could be my alternate. They agreed and that was that, until the coming day.\n\nThat day, didn't go as planned. Usually the officials and invited guests, family of the victim and the convicted are brought into the room first. Then the executioner. There's limited face to face between us and the condemned to lessen any psychological impacts. But this wasn't the case. Somehow the duties got mixed up and the Priest was running late. And I was left in the holding hall with the murderer. Alone.\n\n\"Do you know what my last meal was,\" he asked. \"Bread, and water.\" He chuckled, \"Of course I turned it into water.\"\n\nI tried to ignore him.\n\n\"Say, do you know what happened when they caught me? I was drinking wine-\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" I rapped the wheelchair they had strapped him to.\n\n\"But they said it wasn't wine.\"\n\nThe reports said it was blood.\n\nHe laughed again as if he could hear inside of my head.\n\nBy the time we had gotten everything sorted out, all the people and paper work. It was already an hour past noon. We were running late, and from experience I knew that the governor or some other would start to get cold feet. Call it off. An act of God. To postpone for a review and pen in another date. \n\nBut I knew that if I were called to service again, that I couldn't do it. I wouldn't be able to stand the man a second time. So when they were all gathered properly I pushed forward before anyone could get in a word.\n\nIn less than 15 minutes, we had him strapped up and the machine was primed. The phone was still on the hook and all last rites and goodbyes were said, the prisoner opted to keep silent. And I was given the nod to send justice straight through his brain down to his shoes.\n\nI pulled the lever.\n\nHis body contorted and snapped, shivering. His mouth opened, and I looked inside, to see the deep dark hole, as blue and white lightning flashed from within. And for once I kept my hand on the lever, until his hair stood on end.\n\nWhen the Chief nodded to me, I let it go. Eddie looked at me, his eyes wide and telling, for he knew better than most what I was feeling. That feeling of a murderer. Even in the end, a killer only spreads his killing, as if the madness can jump from one to the other.\n\nBut before anyone could move.\n\nThe man opened his eyes and smiled.\n\nNo one knew what to do.\n\n\"What the fuck happened,\" the Chief yelled at me. \"Was it primed?\"\n\nI nodded, and Eddie agreed. \"I checked it myself,\" Eddie told them.\n\n\"What should we do,\" someone asked.\n\nOne of the men in the plastic seats got up angrily. From the papers I knew him to be Jennifer Tooley's brother. He was full of anger. Rushing forward as two officers detained him. The man in the electric chair only laughed.\n\n\"The governor says do it again,\" said one of his representatives.\n\nThe Chief nodded, \"Alright. Everyone. All clear.\" He looked at the Priest. \"I say we can skip the rites this time.\" I believe the Priest agreed because I got a look to pull it again.\n\nI pulled down the lever and this time I stepped back and watched.\n\nIt went on for 5 more minutes before I was told to turn it off.\n\nThis time, the man was surely dead. For he didn't move. And no one wanted to touch him but somehow Eddie was goaded into approaching the chair. In an instant, blood spurted everywhere. Eddie howled and grabbed at his hand as the man, the murderer, was grinning from ear to ear with a finger in his mouth.\n\nI could hear a few of the women screaming. Some were hurriedly trying to leave. I stood there in shock as I didn't know what to do. And after nearly an hour of commotion, the coroner was forcibly coerced into writing down a time of death. And the man without a name was strapped back into his wheelchair. And I have never heard of him again.\n\n[S](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",
