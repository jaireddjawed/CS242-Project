But it doesn’t actually slow down the spread of their ideology in an age where it can be spread online and anonymously. Hell it’ll just cement it.\n\nBe the bigger man and adopt strategies that will lead to genuine positive change and healing\"\n\n and give them a good reason to take off those hoods and reintegrate into healthy society. Or at the very least, foster a discussion and exchange of information and ideals that will prevent anyone else from feeling like they should grab for one of those hoods.\n\nNot punch them, so they feel further vindicated in hating the \"other\" that just slugged them across the face.\n\nBut it doesn't explain how slugging somebody in the face changes their ideology or stops its spread in an age where it can be spread online and anonymously. I want no nazis, not angrier nazis.\"\n\nSo I was wondering, what do you think of this argument? Is it well founded or wishful thinking?\n",
