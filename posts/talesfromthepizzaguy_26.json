        "text": "Last Thursday was crazy busy and kinda disorganized which was unusual at my small local pizza place. I come in from a delivery and my boss is bagging up two orders. I print the receipt and notice that they're both houses I've been to before and they are right down the street from each other. She says to take one in particular first because they called upset and wanted to know where their food had been. So I figure no problem, right? \n\n\nThese two houses are in literary the nicest neighborhood in our surrounding Houston suburb and it's one of my favorites to go to. The only thing is it's about 15 minutes away. \n\n\nSo I pull up to this fucking mansion and the hot trophy wife opens the door. She gives a smile and does the usual hello so I'm like alright nice she's not gonna be a bitch. When she gets the receipt she says \"this better be hot I ordered an hour and 20 minutes ago it never takes this long.\" I take the $35 worth of food out of the bag and it feels normal so I'm like okay all good. Plus it had only been an hour and like 4 minutes according to the receipt. I also told her it wasn't my fault because you can see how long ago it's been since I left on the receipt also.\n\n\nThis hot mom takes all the shit out of the boxes and starts touching it all over and she goes \"I hate to tell you but this isn't even warm.\" I'm like wellll fuck I don't know what to do. I just let her do her thing for a minute. She gets her husband and he touches the pizza, he literary said \"what's wrong with that\" after touching it. She gets all upset and and hands the other shit to her kids, who she claims are \"starving to death\" (in their million dollar house lmao).\n\nI've been working here for 3 years and driving for 6 months and I've never been in a situation like this. Meanwhile I've got another order of $40 waiting in my car that needs to go! This crazy wife makes me wait forever until she thinks of what to do! She says everything else was kinda warm except for the one pizza. I call my boss and she says she'll void her credit card. I don't give a shit at this point I just want to go right? The mom fucking starts freaking out because she doesn't want free food! I'm getting really flustered at this point I almost fucking left but I was kinda nervous and didn't know what to do.\n\nAfter fucking 15 minutes she hands me $20 and says to use that to pay for the pizza or whatever so I'm like fine fuck it I'm leaving and keeping to the 20. She also makes me take the fucking pizza back! She put her hands all over the damn thing, what was I supposed to do with it? \n\n\nI leave and get to the second house. This guy is a regular and him and his hot wife always tip really well. I do the typically encounter unlike the previous one and hand him his hot food then head back to start closing for the night.\n\nOverall I made off with $33 from the situation, but what the fuck should I have done? What do I do if something this happens again? ",

This was my first delivery of the day.\n\nIt's pretty late, and it is pitch black outside. I take my pizza to it's rightful owner, he pays. all is good. Then, I turn around to leave. Little did I know, this guy is repaving part of his walkway. There were no flags, no orange tape, no lights, or any hint that he was doing construction. I almost immediately step in wet cement which causes me to slip. I then fall into a pile of jagged ass rocks that I guess he is using as stepping stones or some shit. I feel bad, so I go back to tell him that I ruined his cement. I offered to fix it on the spot, but he says not to worry. cool. all is good.\n\nI get back to the car and realize my hand really fucking hurts. I turn on the cab light, and realize my hand is covered in blood. also my pizza bag and bank bag are covered in blood. One of the rocks went through my fingernail and sliced opened my finger. Another cut up part of the tip of a finger, my elbows are bleeding, my knees are scuffed up, and my shoe is full of wet cement.\n\nMoral of the story, if you are repaving your walkway and you order delivery, tell your driver that there is wet cement and giant holes in the walkway! or leave a damn light on. or do both!\n\nsorry about formatting and spelling. I cant really usemy right hand properly. Also I'm fucking pissed that I have to buy new shoes. But I've had my work shoes for like 3.5 years at this point, so I probably need new ones anyways.",

He actually said to me \"Am I cuter than Howard?\"  I had a big laugh and he said the manager figured I was gay -- not that there's anything wrong with that, but I have to learn to be more specific next time LOL.\n\nSo next time I saw Howard we had a huge laugh about it.

        "text": "Before I begin, yes I've filed a report with the police and all the proper procedures have been taken.    \n\nBut yes, I was punched twice in the face today. I was coming back from one of my deliveries and pulled into my parking lot. The moment I opened my door and took a step out a man was in my face. \"What the fuck is your problem!?\" he yelled. I was confused and asked \"Excuse me?\" He repeated his sentence and punched me once in the jaw. Dazed I just kinda looked at him. He yelled \"My son is 16 years old! YOU pulled out of the driveway too fast!\"    \n\n I don't remember any of this. The parking lot is pretty bad with a bunch of blind spots so you have to take it slowly to be safe. Which is what I did. I pulled up slowly with my blinker on and looked both ways, inched out a bit more and did it again, no one was there so I went.     \n\nAnyway, confused I told him I was sorry to which he replied \"Oh you sorry? You sorry?\" \"Yes, I'm sorry\" he punches me again in the face breaking my front tooth and loosing another. As I'm gathering my thoughts and figuring out what happened he begins to leave. I closed my door, grabbed my heat bag and watched him walk to his car. I didn't want to get any closer to him since I was afraid he would come back at me but I tried to get his license plate number. I couldn't. It was too dark and there were too many cars because of the pub next door. \n\nI have pictures but damn... there's a possibility of me losing my tooth and getting it replaced with a fake one. It's currently glued together while I wait to go to the dentist. \n\nUpdate: Yeah my tooth is dead. He basically broke my tooth in half and broke off all the nerves. I have to wait till Monday to possibly get a root canal and some other fixes. ",

        "text": "I've posted here before, yada yada yada, so let's get to it. \n\nThe other night, I was the closing manager, and the last order to come in was a phone order for one pizza, to be delivered to a hotel. \n\nMy closing driver takes it, and comes back with a 15 dollar tip written on the slip, with a signature of Daffy Duck in place of the cardholder's name. He tells the story that a chick took the pizza, while a dude signed the receipt. The guy asked my driver what he wanted as a tip and replied \"Whatever you're comfortable with, man\" and dude's friend proceeds to laugh as he watches dude number 1 sign the slip and fill in a tip and total.  \n\nSo we finishing closing, move on with our lives. Until the next night, after close. The cardholder is calling, pissed because she says a charge to us for 30 bucks and change is on her card. Going on and on about how she wasn't even in the room when the food was delivered, she wants that tip money back, she didn't authorize that much, but she said, and I so freaking quote, \"But, like, I'll still tip the guy five bucks I guess, if I have to\" \n\nI ask if she was aware the other people she was with were going to sign for it, and that they signed as Daffy Duck. She says she was okay with the signing of Daffy Duck, apparently that was prearranged. But not the tip part. \n\nI told her flat fucking out that that is a risk one takes when letting others sign credit slips on their behalf. But god, for one second does she see the light and think, man I should get my 15 bucks back from my jerkass friends? Noooooo, of course not. This isn't a magical land where customers have rational thoughts. \n\nI placated her by telling her I'd talk to the AM about it the next day, and got her off the phone.\n\nI get that she was pissed, but she was talking to the wrong people about it. Demand the damn money from her friends, do a charge back, whatever. I mean, how are we supposed to know for sure the ones signing slips aren't in fact the actual cardholders? I even sign my own credit transactions as Minnie Mouse or Sharon Stone or some crap most of the time on the card readers at the store and stuff, because even when I do my own name it looks like a two year old took some crayons to the wall. If it doesn't even look like my real signature, me putting in Minnie Mouse won't make a difference, really. \n\n\n\n",

Does anyone else have cash, or if you have a credit card we can call the store and pay that way\nhim: we ain't got credit cards. When I called the store I TOLD THEM to have you bring extra change, and they said they would [no they didn't. I even asked the CSR and she remembered telling him we can't bring more than $20] \n\nSo he gives me the $100 and asks to meet him at the gas station down the road. I give the food to his hungry kids (prob the first meal they've had all day, poor kiddos), and the soda (clearly marked as diet coke on the slip) and he's pissed it's not regular soda. I tell him don't worry, I'll get a new one for you at the store. \n\nI follow him, he almost gets into an accident from his terrible driving. Store has a timed delay safe, so have to wait to get my money. Douche ends up leaving me a 30 cent tip. I lost money on the drive by buying him a new 2 liter of soda. \n\nIn hind sight, I shouldn't have gone to the store with him. Should have either made him get change on his own or come to the store (with correct change) but I was new and didn't know better. Came close to ordering a glitter bomb for this dudes' house.",

I pull up to the house to find this guy standing over a fire with a beer in his hand just staring at the fire. I walk up and give the usual spiel, \"Hey how's it tonight going sir?\" Dead silence for a good 5 seconds. Just stares at me. Nothing. Finally: \"Hey.\" Alright, whatever. I hand him the pizza and give him his total, $22 or so. He hands me a $100. Here we go.\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm sorry sir, our policy doesn't allow us to carry change for $100.\"\n\n&gt;Customer: \"Are you serious, that's bullshit! The guy on the phone told me you would!\"\n\nNo he didn't.\n\n&gt;Me: \"I apologize for that sir. Do you have any other bills with you, or would you like to pay with a card?\"\n\n&gt;Customer: \"All I have is this $20.\"\n\nI offered to take the hit on the $2. He refuses (saying he doesn't want to be a jackass) and tells me to call my manager. So I call my manager and talk to him. Manager says to take the $100, make change, and come back. Whatever, I don't care, I just want to get this transaction over with. He doesn't live too far from the store. So I explain the situation to the guy and he agrees and hands me the crumpled up bill.\n\nThis next part is my fault. I make it all the way to the store and pull out the bill. He gave me the fucking $20. Again, completely my fault for not checking. I get back in my car to go back and get the $100, still wishing he would just let me take the $2 hit instead of insisting on this bullshit. Halfway there I get a call from my friend who is working the phones. The guy called back, cussing out the store, saying he doesn't like his pizza and he's not paying the rest for it. Okay, whatever. Case closed.\n\nIt's nothing super crazy but it really pissed me off at the time.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the gold!\n",

        "text": "Last week at around 11:00 at night I went on a delivery to a house that wasn't even a mile from the store, and upon arrival I discovered that I didn't have the correct house number. It was something like \"12302 Street Name\" but the houses weren't numbered that way, and the only house numbers I could see were 12300 and 12304.\n\nI called the number on my tag but no answer. I called several more times and waited the standard five minutes and went back to the store. I explained the situation to my GM, who said to just leave it on the warmer and hope they would call back soon. Since it was an online order, there was no way that it was a mess up on our end, and unfortunately there wasn't much we could do for them except wait.\n\n30 minutes later, we get a call from the customer's wife wondering where the food was, and this was how I learned the area code given to me was wrong. I explained that I had the incorrect address, and asked what the correct one was. The correct house number was 12301. I told her I would leave immediately with their order.\n\nI arrived to find the two customers waiting by the door for me. I was very polite and apologized for the mix-up, telling them thank you and to have a great night.\n\nI thought all was well and good, but when I got back I saw that the husband had left a 1-star review online. My GM was peeved by this, and is required to follow up on bad review scores. I don't see eye-to-eye with my GM on everything, but I will say that he will get his employee's backs on obvious bullshit.\n\nHe tried to have a civil conversation with the guy to resolve the issue, but the customer lied and tried to say that it was all my fault and that I probably just drove up to the house and then drove away. My GM explained that I had the wrong address, phone number, and that I could in no way benefit by not giving them their food. (We live off of tips, dude!) \n\nThe customer tried to blame me for not being able to figure out their real area code or their real address. My GM explained that we get a lot different area codes since we deliver to several different hotels, so it's not uncommon. The guy then tried to blame me for not being able to figure out the correct address, and that I should have tried harder to find the house.\n\nThat's when Mr. Furious started to contradict himself. At first he said he was waiting by his door when I attempted the delivery, and then not even a minute later said he was waiting in his front lawn. If either of these things had been true, I would have seen him, as I was actually parked right outside his house when I was attempting to call him with the incorrect phone number he'd given me.\n\nFor every made up complaint, my GM gave a very easy explanation. Eventually the guy started cursing out my GM, to which my GM replied that he was being very polite and civil with him and that he didn't appreciate him cursing at him or making up stuff about his employees. He was told that he would not be helped if he was going to be disrespectful. Guy then demands the number for our District Manager. \n\nOur GM reluctantly gave him his number, and within a minute he began to repeatedly call the store back to inform us that our DM hadn't answered yet. When our DM eventually answered, the calls stopped for the night. I'm not sure how that situation was resolved yet, but I imagine that our DM listened to the issue and then reinforced us. He doesn't take obvious bullshit either.\n\nAll this craziness just because a grown man can't admit that he made a mistake.",

It's a small pizza store so the kitchen was engulfed in a fog of dust along with the waiting area up front.  So everyone in the kitchen is going nuts, wondering what's going to happen.  Hundreds of dollars of dough, salami, sauce, ruined by the extinguisher gas.  Now the manager of our store decides to call our district manager, let's call him Vince.  Vince decides that we are going to throw out all the pizzas half-way made (just dough and sauce) but all the pizzas that are already cooking or finished will be served to customers.  We were told we had to lie to customers saying the reason their pizza is late is because our ovens shit out.  We never stopped taking orders or closed early which I think is crazy.  The whole store was covered in extinguisher for that whole night and even the next one (the Super Bowl, FUCK).  You could take a finger and wipe extinguisher off of almost anything.  Now instead of getting a proper cleaning crew which I read is the best idea, they decide to just use the dish washing hose and hose the whole restaurant down, which in my opinion just made things worse. I'm sitting here wondering what I should do.  None of us could go home during this whole ordeal and were left with the choice of sitting in the kitchen breathing this in or basically waiting around for hours making no money.  I feel pretty terrible about giving people those pizzas but I had just got in to work and really couldn't go home with $0 in my pocket.  Any ideas on what to do guys?",

Opening-Closing(OC) shifts are triple hell. no scheduled breaks during this hell? the only break you can get is if you force it and even then thats hard to do.\n\n* boring as fuck....utlimately you're doing grunt work. its boring as fuck\n\n* Im just going to say i want to kill the architects of my city....the i've posted about this in other places....but the highlight had to be when i found the street address written in black sharpie on the inside of the mailbox(i was checking for mail to check the address)....i silently cried for a few minutes. a part of me died at that moment in time.....this can turn a 15 minute round trip in 30...easily.\n\n* 70 hour work weeks....while i admit this is partly my fault, it is also partly the managers fault for saying he needed me 6 days a week for just a week or two  while he hired more drivers....this job is a special kind of hell already, its really special at 70 hours a week. our poor store manager is clocking in 80-90 a week. another store in town as the store manager OC 7 days a week. its simply insane.\n\n* this job is somewhat retail and thus contains all the hell that is retail\n\n* as a driver....i signed up to delievery and occassional help out in the store....in reality due to either poor management, getting slammed, or simply being understaffed(we've only had 2 managers ever at a time for the entire week, and like 2-4 cooks that work 15 hours a week  each)....the drivers get to pinch hit everywhere.  stocking, cooking, phones, cleaning, in store customers, etc. thus there is never a down moment for the driver.\n\n* closing driver....cleaning the front. if i closed with the assistant manager....she  quickly figured out, if my last delivery is 50 minutes after we close then her ass is going to be stuck at the store extra late....so she would help clean the store....the store manager? not so much. cleaning the front by yourself = a bitch....a  bitch you dont want none of after a 9 hour shift of no breaks or worse yet, an OC with no breaks or a friday.\n\n* OC then open the next day....fuck that shit. just fuck that shit. this shift should not exist. yet at least 4 of us get it weekly. it was 5, until the assistant manager couldnt do it anymore because shes pregnant.\n\n* soul sucking experience that drains your life....your one day off, you need massive amounts of coffee just to even be able to watch TV....its a general consensus that i could gather that one day off a week meant you have to choose between sleep or doing shit.\n\n* no end to the negative energy at the store.\n\n* too easy to eat dominoes every day....what i mean is, food is there, its bad for you, but damnit its been a 10 hour straight marathon and you're hungry....you'll eat nearly anything at that point...thus contributing to the poor health\n\n* customer is always right....fuck this shit. the customer is rarely right\n\n* store manager.....he caves into customers all the time. assistant manager? was a little harder to deal with....but some of the time pawned bitchy customers off on me knowing i would not give them free shit and enjoyed telling them no. but still if the store manager is there? nothing is quite as soul sucking as hearing a customer bitch at you only to get free shit and having to tolerate it.\n\n* leave your sanity and manhood at the door.....really because you are doing a job a trained monkey could do. you are a gopher boy. doing random shit. and sometimes taking orders that other drivers screwed up, so you get screwed out of a tip....taking orders to known non-tippers due to bad luck on the order screen, and taking orders back to customers after you tried contacting them 45353543 times and they no answer the door or phone...only to get back to the store and an hour later have to give them their now free pizza because its all your fault.\n\none of my last favorites of that was.....i got a flat tire at the beginning of the neighborhood...i call this bitch 3 times, voicemail and text her. im calling the boss saying i have a flat. i call AAA and am youtubing how to change a flat tire....during this time someone comes back and helps me. between a combination of fuck it i don't care about the stuck up bitch who wont answer her phone....and being nice to kind fellow that helped me. i gave him the whole order.\n\ni get back to the store.....now an hour and 10 minutes later....now sometime after that....who should call? after we are closed? 45 minutes after we are closed? the person that didnt answer the phone. whining she never got her food.\n\nshe ordered food again at some point....bitch didnt answer her door again.....fuck you bitch\n\nas said...leave your balls and manhood and self esteem at the door....you are a bitch while working there.\n\nyes this is filled with random cussing. im venting in the process of this too.\n\nso i put in my two weeks....told him i didnt want work the superbowl either, he says it is mandatory. i say ok(i should have argued more but i didnt ....10 hour shift plus had to open the next day and was closing that night....wasnt thinking clearly). so whatever its mandatory everyone is on the schedule.\n\nnext weeks schedule? at least 5 people are off on the superbowl.....i message him wednesday and tell him find a new closer for sunday. friday he says go home i dont need you if you wont work. i tell him thats BS not everyone is scheduled. whatever.\n\nand speaking of the schedule....our schedule is monday-sunday? shit was rarely posted by tuesday.\n\nit'd literally be monday at 3 and i wouldnt know if i was coming in or not....i'd literally have this conservation:\n\n\"what time am i coming in?\"\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"I dont know 5 or 530\"\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"well which is it?\"\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Im not sure\"\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"so....what time do you want me to come in?\"\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"5\"\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ndominoes has this lovely thing where you cannot clock in without a manager override if you are more than 5 minutes early....guess how often i saw that screen!\n\nspeaking of overrides.....why do i need an override for cash orders?\n\nall and all, i just had to get out....i couldnt take it. and some coworkers were awful. one was a crazy guy who took at least 40 minutes for any delievery.....another was a woman who looked like she hated everything at all times....and our store manager if you looked into his eyes i swear i saw the eyes of a deadman on the inside. he also had mood swings. bad bad mood swings.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It was a slow day today. Just me and one other driver. I'll called him The Child. Guy constantly asks me for deliveries because he knows they tip well or because he knows the people. Okay, whatever. I'm usually not worried about it. He's even mentioned that the other drivers always refuse. Well, as of today, ALL of the drivers are going to be refusing because I'm absolutely pissed at him.\n\nI'm sure most of you know how it works. Drivers are rotated, first driver usually takes the first one, second takes the second, etc. Occasionally some are up before others.\n\nI'm in the back, hear \"DELIVERY\" and head up because it's mine. Hear another \"DELIVERY\" while I'm up there and there's 3 on the screen total. The Child says he doesn't know which one is up, so I go and look. Mainway and Westgate, we'll say, in that order. I mention to The Child if he wants me to take both because there's a third about to come up, and he scoffs, saying it's not a good double (one's out there, but the first one is one that I'd be passing by). \n\nSo, whatever. I guess I'll just take one. I go and route out, and the Child is all, well that one's not up. Um, yeah, it is, it's right over there. \n\nInstead of looking, he goes straight to the manager and says \"There's a problem, she's skipping orders.\" \n\nExcuse me? The first one is up, I routed on the first one. So Manager goes and looks at it, asks which one is older. First one is at 19 minutes (second is at 15) and the guy on cut has just placed a pizza with it (Apparently it wasn't finished, but there's a routine. The ticket doesn't go down on the heat rack until the whole order is down. When I checked earlier, the ticket was down). Either way, it's done now. But The Child says that the second delivery is up first. \n\nThese deliveries were finished less than 2 minutes of each other. One was not sitting there for ages that I just 'overlooked'. I try to tell the manager, I am *not* skipping orders, this is the first order, and he just says, it's not done, you shouldn't have routed on it. The freaking ticket was down! I didn't know, but it's done now. But he goes and makes me unassign myself and take the second one. Which turns out to be a regular that tips one buck despite living at the very edge of the delivery range. \n\nWhen I took that delivery, he took 2. And when I took my next delivery, he took another 2.  I took 3 in total and walked out with 10 bucks tonight. \n\nAnd you know, this guy, he's always acting like he *needs* the money but whenever I offer him to close for me, he's always got plans or just doesn't want to. Even when I have something due an hour after closing time for school, he just goes \"sucks to be you\" and constantly jokes when *he's* closing that he heard that I wanted to close that night. \n\nYeah, no, not anymore. He's not getting any of those deliveries he wants me to give him, and I don't care if his mother is dying in the hospital, I am not covering for him. \n\nThis is guy is like 30 and went and tattled to the manager on me for something I didn't even do wrong. It ticks me off so much. Ugh.\n",

It's like a rowdier party bar that is also a tad sketchy. \n\n\nI was out on a delivery that only took about 10 minutes total so I was not long. When I came into the store through the normal front entrance I notice two very very drunk people beating the absolute shit out of each other in our entryway. They were being watched silently by a woman that was with them and my co-workers, no one else around. \n\nI get around them and go behind the counter and talk to my co-workers and but they are too busy screaming at the gladiators.\n\nThe woman with them appeared to be one of the fightees GF's. We are yelling at them telling them to stop and get out in a very frantic way and the human female keeps responding:\n\n\"it's okay they're friends\"\n\"NO ITS FINE THEY ARE FRIENDS\"\n\n\nOne of these guys takes a damn big swing and knocks the other out. There he is, this unknown man who probably has himself a cat back at home, as he seems like he can barely remember his now long gone early 20's, flat on the floor. There is blood dripping down his face out of newly created orifices that were not created with love. \n\nMy coworker calls the cops as I stand in front of my female co-worker afraid this drunk dude wants to start something else. Their female friend is on her knees on the ground with the knocked out dude's head in her lap bleeding from every which way. She didn't seem worried at all. \n\nBut why would she \"they're friends\"\nI turn and tell my female (human) co-worker to go in the back as I look for a weapon as the victor was pacing around his last victim. \n\n\nWith the Gladiator fight over and the knocked out dude struggling his head towards the ceiling, they exit together like nothing happened. \n\nA cop showed up later and we told him everything, he said nothing will be done unless it is reported by the dude that got his shit kicked in, not sure why. \n\nWhen we left later that night and walked out towards our cars we saw blood on the ground in different spots, little drips, like the defeated man was spitting on their way out.\n\nThis was at 7pm. On the Lord's day. I love the superbowl.\n\n\nTL;DR Fight broke out in shop, woman didn't seem to care and Maximus was spittin blood later\n\nEDIT: God my formatting is shit no matter how I spin it.",

This meant we had just passed the busiest point of the night, but orders were still be quoted at an hour or more for delivery. Not the best time for stuff to get screwed up, but inevitably something's gotta go wrong.\n\nI get to the address on my slip and I ring the doorbell. A very tired woman answers the door after a minute, holding a quietly fussing newborn. Now, I've been around babies a lot, so I always feel bad when I wake one up. But the true moment of mortification was when I saw the look of confusion on the woman's face. \n\nI had awoken this woman's infant and she hadn't even been expecting me.\n\nI quickly pull out my delivery slip and I confirm that I'm at the correct address. I ask her if she knows the name on my slip, and she says that it's her daughter's ex-boyfriend. I apologize over and over again, and the woman's really nice about it. \n\nI get in my car and call the guy, and I get his actual address. When I get to the actual delivery destination, I ask how he'd made his order. It's an internet order, aha. Looks like someone used an autofill function without checking for accuracy. I let him know what went wrong and he apologizes. No harm done.\n\nI head back to my store and I pick up an incoming call about thirty minutes later. I notice it's the same address I'd just delivered to, but I don't say anything about it. They're making another delivery order, and I let them know that our deliveries are still going out at an hour at least, and that carry out orders are a minimum of forty minutes as well.\n\nThe guy is not pleased by this. \"What, even if I tip three dollars?\"\n\nCute. I tell him, no, there is absolutely no way to expedite an order in the middle of a super bowl rush, not with 90 pizzas currently queued up to be made. \n\nBut what's really cute is when he continues.\n\n\"Well, the girl that just delivered here a little while ago took my food to the wrong address first. Does that change anything?\"\n\nOhoho. \n\nA smile spreads over my face as I say the words \"Sir, the girl that just took that order to you was me. And I believe we already agreed that the cause of that error was on your end, not ours.\" \n\nI hear sputtering for a second or two, then he hangs up. \n\nGotta love it when you can actually call a customer out on their bullshit. \n\nTl;dr: Customer made a mistake and tried to blame me for it to get his food faster in the middle of a super bowl rush, makes his complaint to me without realizing it.

        "text": "Oh, it's better than you're thinking.\n\nIt was late last Friday night, and just me, the manager in charge, and another driver were working (we're a low volume store, so at about eleven PM this is enough).  A delivery comes up for me: cheesy bread and a double cheese pizza with no sauce, sausage on one side, spinach on the other.  It did not smell quite right for a pizza, but whatever.  I took it outside with its accompanying two-liter Sprite, turned the key, and...*click*.\n\nI left nothing on in the car, so there's no reason the battery should be dead, but there was no time to worry about it then.  I explained the problem, and the manager tried to jump me off, but it didn't work fast enough and the delivery needed to be taken.  He told me to make the delivery in his car.\n\nNow, I was pretty nervous about driving someone else's car, but as the other driver was busy and we'd already wasted too much time, I didn't protest.  I went back outside and disconnected the jumper cables from his battery, but had some trouble closing the hood; I had to set the food down to fiddle with it and figure it out.  Well, strictly speaking, that's not true--I couldn't detach the rod from the hood because it was not detachable.  His car is newer than mine, and the rod was spring-loaded, so all I actually needed to do was shut the hood.  I get confused *so* easily sometimes.\n\nAs I'm leaving the parking lot, I hear a thump.\n\nCan anyone guess where I'd set the food down?\n\nA couple minutes later, after the manager had had the time to run to the office for my number, I got a call.  He informed me that as I was leaving the parking lot he observed the two-liter falling off the top of the car.\n\nMortified, I stopped to turn around, but first I got out and checked the top of the car.  Nothing.\n\nI went to the drive-through and Other Driver handed me the replacement drink and nothing else.  I had no choice.  I had to ask: \"Uh...what about the food?\"\n\nThe look on his face, oh.  And the sentence I'll never forget.  Its content was unremarkable given the circumstances, but I can't describe the amazement in his voice: \"You didn't put the ***food*** in the car?\"\n\nI panicked, and ran across the parking lot of the shopping center where our store is, and saw no hotbag anywhere on the ground.  There was nothing left to do but go inside and explain, humiliated.  The manager was a bit annoyed about having to make the food again, but he at least didn't get upset with me.  Before the new food was done, the other driver took a delivery and came back with a second hotbag.  \"Is this your delivery, Corac42?  Is this what it looks like?\"\n\nHe had found it lying on the road a short way from the parking lot.  The flap had come open and the cheesy bread was lying out in the middle of the street, so he simply got out and picked it all up.  As for the pizza, it looked a little different than it had the last time I'd seen it.\n\nThe customers didn't seem to even notice that the food was late.",

Basically, the entire community holds them to high regard; every customer that walks in always greets the owners as if they were the best of pals, orders range from the usual $30+ to a whopping $100+ because of catering orders(it's a rich neighborhood after all), and their delivery reach stretches all the way out of town(let me put it this way: whenever I deliver within the town and the neighboring ones, it takes 5-10 minutes tops but these guys take deliveries from people who live practically 20-25 minutes away which they compensate you for depending how far it is so it's fair)\n\nThe tips are super generous(ranging around common 5's with the semi rare 10's and super rare 20's depending on how big the order is) which is a far cry from the old place I used to work at.\n\nNow, I love my job despite the fact that a) they pay $3/hr BUT the tips make up for it and b) I'm pretty much the odd one out because literally all my co-workers are your die hard sports junkies that discuss sports everyday so I pretty much go through the day with very little interaction.\n\nNow, there are two types of shifts: mornings (11AM start) and afternoon/evenings(that's me and a couple others, we call ourselves the 4PM crew for obvious reasons). There are only three people that come in the morning that I'd like to call the big three. After working with them for months, I can safely say that two of them are really nice, big bro types while one of them has a brooding, money hungry persona (let's call him Rob). Now these three come in almost everyday at 11 and usually leave when orders start dwindling around 7 or 8, or sometimes they stay all the way until close and let me tell you that these guys end a shift with $200-$400 in their pocket at the end of the night.\n\nYou're probably wondering how but it's simple: the store gives them 95% of the big orders. Seriously, whenever there's a $100+ order, you bet your ass that they're going to get it. Picture this: say it's your turn to deliver. There are two tickets with a total of...let's say $35.93 and another of $105.58. Say that the latter is ready to go AND its you and one of the big three that are the only drivers in the store at that moment. You might think that you get the big order because you're next to go right? WRONG! The owners will maneuver around it to make sure that you get the small order while they get the big order. This happened to me on some occasions(ironically all involving Rob) whereas it was my turn and there's this huge order ready. I asked my boss if the order was ready to go and he ended up saying that it's missing a couple of slices. Lo and behold, Rob comes back from a delivery and I knew from there that I was fucked. Of course, they hand me the small order of $11 because that miraculously was ready out of nowhere and as I sat in my parked car that was facing the store, I see my boss pull out the missing box of slices hidden beneath the counter and sent Rob on his merry way. \n\nOther incidents included them putting small stuff(such as slices) from big orders in the oven last minute in order to give someone who's up for delivery from the 4pm crew an excuse as to why they can't take it yet when in reality, it's to give any of the big three who are out on delivery ample time enough to come back and take said order OR that one occasion when Rob was last in queue for delivery but of course, a huge order was ready to go and with only the 4pm crew in sight, one of the bosses announced to all the drivers that the huge order was for Rob's friend so he gets to take it. It's safe to say that not a soul believed that bullshit. It's not all doom and gloom though, during the weekends where the store gets super busy in rush hours, the owners, in a way, don't exactly get picky with who gets what and simply hands any delivery to whoever driver is present(but they still do have their moments with orders that break the $100+ mark, especially the catering ones) but on a slow weekday? Good luck getting any of those kinds of orders because the big three got dibs on them.\n\nThere are a lot of occasions where I had a glimpse of the perks these three get but I'll name the two that stand out: once there was a football game for one of the prominent universities that we deliver to, a big order of $1500 paid in full via card to feed the whole team of players, coaches, etc. with a $150 tip attatched to it and another on a much smaller scale of a total of $220 with a $40 tip. Yeah, these guys are big time.\n\nI know that I'm sounding like an ungrateful prick, especially after years of reading stories that go through here about people getting stiffed or being underpaid, and I get it, I should accept what I have and be happy about it. Today, it's not something that makes me as furious as before because of the fact that maybe this is how they reward those three guys since they work 10+ hour shifts everyday and the more I thought about that, the more I was at peace with it. I guess all I wanted was for the wealth to be shared and for the favoritism to be toned down a bit but you know, after my last job where tips were scarce and favoritism was common practice, this place isn't as bad and I'm starting to feel alright taking home $60 on average per shift. I guess I was just bothered by the feeling that I could get more which borders on greed(I guess?) but it's no matter. The customers tip frequently and I do get to take big orders from time to time so yeah...all I could do right now is go with the flow and simply accept it.\n",

        "text": "This day... Good God this day. \n\nOk, I guess I should start off saying I am an assistant manager at a certain place where you take the pizza and bake it yourself. \n\nIt was a shitshow of a day. So first off, in my state, we have to have our lunch break by the 5th hour of the day. That was the first mistake. I was scheduled noon to ten, which means my lunch had to come at the literal peak hour of business. I was given two complete noobs to get through 3-5. For whatever reason, in my part of the city, we get really REALLY busy in that time. And at 2:45 my morning FOH person tells me absolute last minute he has to leave right that second, because otherwise he will be hit with a 100$ late fee on rent. I totally get that, but goddamn, would it have been too much to let me know beforehand? On top of that he was already an hour and a half late. Normally he isn't late and if he has been, he let us know. So it usually isnt really too much of a problem. But now, on top of add on sales not being finished, he has to leave and I have one noob to get me through the next hour, whih is usually when the shit starts. And of course I have a million things to do to prep for tomorrow, because of course its one of the busiest days of the entire year. So I send him home and get my 3 o'clock noob on early so at least I have someone to help some on things. And of course it gets crazy busy. My 4 o'clock person arrives early and I need her on early too. The thing  about new people is they really aren't too much help, because they are still learning. And most days its not too much of a problem for 3-5, its busy enough they are learning but no so busy they are an issue. But today was the worst for that.  I called someone ( we are a new store and dont exactly have many people who are very good) and no answer, so I pretty much have to tough it out. Now here is the problem. In this hour, I absolutely have to take my lunch, otherwise I am breaking state laws and corporate gets really, REALLY pissed. As soon as my 5 o'clock showed up (5 minutes before her shift) I tell her she HAS to clock on now, because she is the only person of worth for a bit to come on. I got my break, but at literally the worst time possible. On top of that I havent eaten all day and had to make a pizza to eat real quick. I ate literally one slice and just wanted to get on the line. Finally I do and got the rush in some sort of order, but now I have this shitty survey because my crew cant handle 20 fucking tickets without adult supervision.\n\nI don't mean to ramble and I can still keep going, and I havent posted here yet. I really needed to vent though, it was one of those 3 doubles and a shit beer in a row kind of night. \n\nI just want to know that I'm not crazy and  wasn't the only one who got fucked with a 10 inch dildo 8 ways to Sunday??",

Had a hiccup the first day and got sick with the California virus that's been spreading around but showed up with a drs note that said 2 days' of rest. Paid $150 for that note :/ \n\nAfter this I've showed up for every single one of my shifts which should say something about my work ethic but I'm only getting scheduled once a week. I was called in because someone else got sick and covered for them. Even clocked on a half hour early since they needed help. \n\nAt this point I'm still getting only one day of work a week. I've asked for more hours for the last three weeks and I keep getting the same answer - \"That they need to keep training people.\" \n\nThey fired a manager and I still didn't get any hours. I'm a team member and I checked the schedule. New workers are getting more hours than I am! \n\nExcept for the one hiccup with being sick enough to the point of not being able to get out of bed except to go see the dr who even wrote the virus on the note, I don't see what the problem is. \n\nBased on my quarterly earnings from my previous job I would make around $100 more on unemployment weekly than my current job. \n\nI'm still looking for other jobs as much as I can but it's a bit infuriating that I've asked for more hours and have gotten nothing. \n\nWould it be possible to write constructive termination or potentially get partial unemployment? I was under the impression that they really liked me. The guy even said so during the interview. \n\nI would understand maybe for one week having less hours because of the calling in sick but that doesn't mean an entire month along with new employees getting more hours. \n\nI checked the drivers' schedules and they are the ones who have 5 straight 6 hour days. \n\nAnyone else in a similar situation?",

I knocked very loudly on the front door a couple times but was left with no answer. I was about to call when a group of people came around from the back and said the pizza was ordered from the back house (**61A instead of **61). Fair enough, some people forget to put in the letter for their delivery address.\n\nI went around back, greeted the man waiting there and was met with confusion. He ran upstairs and started asking around who ordered pizza but couldn't find anyone who did. While I was waiting I called the customer who said she would be right down. As I was walking back around a car pulled into the alleyway and the driver shouted that it was her pizza then told the man in back to just hold onto it for her. He was about to try to take it when I told him I had already called and the customer was going to pick it up front. Sure enough she was up front, rather amused that I had tried the back address but happy to receive her food. In retrospect I probably should have just called first.\n\nHave any of you guys had some confusing deliveries where you can't seem to find who it belongs to?",

To my surprise, I peek in a see two younger people in the throws of passion. It was late and I really wanted to get back and start clean up so I wouldn't be late but at the same time, remember what it was like when you had your girl over and the house to yourself. I left and delivered my other order then returned. Upon my return I see that the porch light is now on and find the volume has been turned down. I ring the doorbell and a barely covered older teen answers.

Things started out okay, but then little by little, it just ate away at me until I finally quit yesterday. \n\nThe job advertised flexible hours. I gave my availability, and almost every week, the regional manager would dick around with the schedule, and change my hours outside of my availability. My GM was cool about it and said it wasn't him, come in when I can, etc. That was fine until we started getting a shortage of drivers, and it was rare for me to leave at my scheduled time. I was asked to close every night, despite having a day job. \n\nThe other thing I disliked is that us drivers had to do everything. Had I known I would be taking orders, preparing food, manning the ovens/cut table, staying until 4am cleaning and doing dishes, etc., I would have seriously reconsidered. I can understand helping a bit when there are no deliveries, tagging boxes, or grabbing something from the cooler, whatever. But the store either out of desperation or by a stupid management decision, never had enough csrs to be fully staffed. They just relied on us drivers to help with everything. There were many days were I would go off the road to help clean up the mess from being understaffed, sometimes for hours, taking orders, tagging boxes, and getting everything under control. \n\nI guess the tips weren't bad... most days were hit or miss. I only broke $100 once, and that was a 9 hour shift with very few drivers. I think my worst night was $18 for a 4.5 hour shift... pretty pathetic. I did work with some cool people, but they were all so political, and would blast heavy metal, which got annoying after a while. \n\nThanks for letting me vent. Glad to find others that understand.

In fear of pissing the customer off, I hadn't gotten tipped yet, we were pretty slow, and because I didn't want to have to drive back if necessary.\n\nSo a totally casual delivery. Get to the door, give him the credit card receipt, and he insists I give him the food before he signs it. This is something unusual for me and I'm not a big fan, I like to get paid before I hand the food over.\n\nSo he walks inside with the credit card receipt and food. He comes back out and says \"Wait here okay?\" So with my pretty-customer-face I say sure. \n\nNow I know you all know that when I say something like \"I waited 2 minutes\" or 3 minutes, you know it doesn't sound long but it *is*. \"Standing at the door time\" as you know, feels like forever. So after about 2 or 3 I go back to my car and just chill waiting for this dude. I call the store, manager says just hold out for a minute or two, and maybe knock again. \n\nThe reason I *didn't* knock was because I'm a total weiner with customer satisfaction, unless they have done something directly negative to me. So I didn't want to bother him had he been doing something important. I had planned to knock after another minute or so. Hindsight is 20/20.\n\nSo after about a total of almost **8** minutes of waiting, the door opens and he waves me out of the car. He's got a credit card receipt in his hand. I walk up and he hands it to me, and says the worst sentence I've probably ever heard:\n\n\"Hey man, everything was great, the family loved it, have a good one.\"\n\nHe and his family had eaten the entire meal, before simply signing the receipt for payment. They had literally sat down and eaten, while I was waiting outside. For all he knows, I was *standing* outside.\n\nI didn't even say anything. Just walked away. Still fucking hate that guy.\n\nEdit: Tip was some nonsense like $3 or $4. Nothing worth waiting. ",

        "text": "Though I last delivered a pizza in 1989, this is probably my favorite sub. I like hearing from the people still in the trenches and thought some of them might like to hear my stories from way-back-when. Here are my Tales from the Pizza Guy.\n\nBurned Out\n\nAfter about a year in LA, I decided to return to Northern California. The franchisee I had worked for offered to set me up as co-owner in a new store. I moved back up North and returned to managing the Walnut Creek store until we could get a new one up and running nearby. But it was over. It was 1989 and I was burned out -- I realized that as soon as I took over at Walnut Creek again. I worked for a few months and then left.\n\nI worked for Domino’s for about five years, and it really was a great job for me where I was in my life at that time. I also tell people without exaggeration that I ate pizza just about every day for five years and never got tired of it. Pretty sure I could still do that. \n\nOne thing I imagine being different about pizza delivery today than it was back then is how complex the orders can be. Back then, a significant part of the Domino’s philosophy was to keep it simple. We offered pizza and coke (not even diet coke) -- that was it. And the pizza was just New York style -- though I was there for the start of pan pizzas. I can’t imagine how much more difficult it is to keep track of sides and salads and add-ons, though I imagine the computerized system helps somewhat. The Culver City store I worked at had an early computerized order system, and it worked pretty well. \n\nOn the other hand, getting rid of the 30-minute guarantee was a great thing. You avoid the sorts of games customers would play to get their discount (the chief victim of those games being the driver). You still get behind, and you’re still motivated to get the pizzas there as quickly as you can, but some of the pressure is off, and you don’t have customers intentionally delaying you.\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nI did have one more short stint in the pizza business, this time half-way across the country.\n\nAfter I left Domino’s, I worked in electrical assembly for a year or so and then decided to go to Graduate School. I took the GRE applied to various schools and was accepted at Northwestern in Evanston outside of Chicago. I got to Chicago a month or two before school was to start, so I got a job at a pizza place in Evanston to make ends meet for that time, and then for the next couple of Summers. Delivery was secondary for this shop, and the owner brought me in that first month to observe and help them boost their delivery business and business in general. I didn’t do any delivery here, and for the first time I was working at a place with table service and a broad menu.\n\nHe had me sit in the restaurant and just observe for about a week and write up a report and suggestions. My primary observation was that there was a lack of management presence. The funny thing was, I didn’t even realize the owner considered himself the manager. He would sit in a small office in the back of the restaurant and basically not come out all day. I basically told him to his face that he was the problem, which I don’t think I could have done if I’d known what I was saying. But yeah, the fact that I didn’t even realize he was “managing” the restaurant kind of proved my point. \n\nI don’t want to say anything bad about him though -- he was a very nice guy and helped me out a lot. I think his main source of income was a bar he owned in Chicago, so the pizza place was just a side for him.\n\nI think the next Summer I was working there when two drop-dead gorgeous models walked in. They were tall and beautiful and fully made-up. They were with a photographer and were presumably taking a break for lunch. I guess they were shooting somewhere on the beautiful Northwestern campus. I was behind the counter with a woman who did not hide the fact that she was a lesbian. She sidled up to me and whispered “I’ll fight you for them.”\n\nTastes were different in the Midwest. We served garlic bread, and the way it was to be prepared was to wrap it in foil and run it through the pizza ovens (we had conveyer ovens here). The garlic bread would come out soft and squishy. But where I was from, garlic bread should be toasty and crisp on the top, with some of the garlic caramelizing in the oven. So one time I took a moment and prepared what I thought was perfect garlic bread -- it was light brown on top with some dark patches around the edge. I proudly gave it to the customer only to have them return it a few minutes later complaining that it was burned.\n\nThe second summer I worked there, the owner opened up a burrito place next door to the pizza place. I got to work there for some of my shifts. I remember burning my fingers making burritos on the hot grill. But my fingers didn’t burn as much as the woman who spent an hour or so chopping dried chilies to go into a sauce. She didn’t know to wear gloves and ended up going to the hospital with chemical burns on her hands.\n\n\nAnd after that it truly was the end. My last year in Graduate School I worked at MicroCenter selling Macs, and I never went back to the restaurant industry. My wife and I loved Chicago, but ended up moving back to the Bay Area, and I now live a few blocks from one of the stores I worked at while at Cal.\n\nThanks to everyone for reading this. I’ve enjoyed remembering all of these things and writing them down and really loved the comments.\n\nMay your traffic be light, may all your runs be swift, and may all your customers be big tippers.",

I like hearing from the people still in the trenches and thought some of them might like to hear my stories from way-back-when. Here are my Tales from the Pizza Guy.\n\nCulver City\n\nAfter graduating from Cal, I got it into my head that I wanted to be a screenwriter, so I moved down to LA to live with a friend who was working as a camera operator in “The Industry.” Again, I tried to find another job, but ended up back at Domino’s in Culver City. I was back to driving, though -- I no longer saw myself with a career in the pizza business. The manager loved me, though, because I could fill in for inside shifts if no one else was available.\n\nI became one of the regular day shift drivers. If it’s still similar to what it was then, night drivers should pity the day drivers. Tips sucked. Often I would  start at 10 or 11 but only make tips on the runs I made between 4:00 and checking out. I remember one day working a full shift, ten or twelve deliveries, and not a single dime in tips. I had bought a soda for $.95 and was $.95 short when I checked out.\n\nOne time I came out to my car to make a delivery, and one of the other drivers was sitting in the driver’s seat, smoking. He had needed a light so used the lighter in my car. I did not smoke and was livid. My car smelled for days after that. I’m pretty sure that’s the only time that lighter was used.\n\nI got pretty clever about delivering to certain apartments. There are some types of security systems that have a code you can enter to open the door -- it was some combination of characters and then the last part of the phone number. More than once I used that to deliver to someone who wasn’t answering the phone to buzz me in (the 30-minute guarantee made people want to play games -- it’s amazing what people will do for $3). I assume there are still door systems like this -- you would know better than I.\n\nOne time I got to an apartment and they would not pick up to buzz me in. This wasn’t a system I could get through, so I waited. Then I noticed a gap under the gate -- just big enough to slide a pizza bag. I slipped the pizza under the gate, then climbed up and over. I found the apartment and noticed the phone receiver sitting off the hook when I delivered the pizza. Bastards.\n\nI was at the store the day of the first President Bush’s inauguration. Actually, I suppose it had to be a day or two later. At some point in the afternoon helicopters appeared over head. Then all traffic in front of the store disappeared. Before we knew it, a string of limousines came down the street. Now Ex-President Reagan was in the window of one of the cars, waving as he headed home after his time in the White House. As much as I had hated him as President (a lot), at this point he was just a nice old man, and I was happy to wave to him.\n\nNext Episode: The End",

Now most nights I work as a shift lead but to keep things varied I request driving shifts 1-2 times a week. This night in particular one of our drivers had quit a few days earlier and one had his alternator die which was still being fixed. As a result it was myself and three other drivers, one of which had to leave about halfway through the night.\n\nAfter about an hour things started picking up a lot. I went from waiting for my orders to be ready to coming in, grabbing a triple, and leaving within 2 minutes. Even with all four of us working like this we were just barely keeping up. Then the fourth driver had to leave. Even with all of us going full speed, prioritizing delivers/hour instead of first come first serve we were quickly falling behind, and yet for all of us the tips kept coming. I was regularly getting $5 tips even with late orders and (amazingly) I never got a stiff all night; the lowest tip I got was $2.\n\nIn the end I ended up making $116 in just over 6 hours in tips alone being greeted with happy cheers of \"pizza's here\" almost every time. Nights like this make me wonder why I don't just deliver full time.",

I'll just take this moment of anger and boiling temple....to remember the nicest, the kindest and most generous customers.\n\nOne time, I fucked up on a phone order. A pizza had to be remade. I delivered it too and he called when I got back. Completely my fault and the fact that he tipped so well earlier made me feel even worse. So I sucked it up and took responsibility. Taking the remade pizza and I fully expect a frown, a scowl. Something. Ring the door bell:\n\n\"Hi how are you, I sincerely apologize again.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it, how much?\"\n\nI'm now leaving and talking to him over my shoulder\n\n\"Oh no, it's free\"\n\n\"No no, I don't want to do that to you, man. Come back please.\"\n\nI insist but he insists too, now almost running after me. \n\nI'm so touched by this kindness that I give him a discount and he hands me a $20 and I'm getting change but he says to keep it. All of it. \n\nEarly on when I started, we had a regular customer who always ordered subs, cheese fries and a 2 liter diet coke. I, of course, fuck up and get a regular coke. I get there and he says he wanted a diet coke. I had 2 deliveries waiting for me back at the store on the other side of town, so I tell him the truth: I probably wont be able to get it to you for another hour or so. I fully expect to be yelled at, anything, but nope...he takes it...doesn't call the store back to complain. Nothing. Fast forward a few months and he calls again. I remember him of course and he remembered me too. I made sure I got everything right. I get there and he tips me $7. His orders never go over $20 but he always tips between 6 and 8. Even though I fucked up his drink. He tips me that much every single time. \n\nSo, yes. During times of anger and frustration, I'll remember the best ones. ",

That itself set off whistles and i was definitely checking the bills.\n\nso i complete the transaction and head back toward the car stopping to check the bills at the light by the entrance and sure as shit they were fake. they were Movie money. boy was i pissed and she was about to have a night she wouldn't forget.\n\nI proceeded to the car and called my boss gave him a short brief of the situation and called the cops. \n\ncops came and i hung out for almost an hour while they figured out everything and they gave me money from the mom to cover one of the bills and a card to cover the other.\n\nCalled the card in and it wouldn't accept in the computer. so the cops told me that since the \"suspect\" was special needs they weren't going to be arresting her but giving her tickets for theft and fraud and would be checking in on her every so often till the court date.\n\nWent back to the shop and explained the whole story to everyone gave the boss the report number the officers gave and and checked out and went home because fuck scumbag people.",

        "text": "Though I last delivered a pizza in 1989, this is probably my favorite sub. I like hearing from the people still in the trenches and thought some of them might like to hear my stories from way-back-when. Here are my Tales from the Pizza Guy.\n\nBerkeley and Around\n\nWhile back at school I worked a few shifts a week at a Domino’s on University Avenue in Berkeley. I also worked one night a week at the Domino’s in El Cerrito for the franchise owner’s brother in law. During the Summers I would work full time at a different store, sometimes as store manager, sometimes as assistant. I think they used me somewhat as a “fixer,” putting me in troubled stores hoping I would get things back on track.\n\nThis is the period of the infamous “Noid” advertising campaign, and the franchisee had bought a Noid costume for events -- huge plastic head and all. I remember them going to all of the stores looking for someone to wear the costume at events. The only one willing to do this -- and I have no idea why he said “yes” -- was someone who gave “Joy” in Santa Barbara a run for her money (if you didn’t read the first part, think of “Sadness” from In and Out). He was very low energy and while not really negative, certainly not a positive personality. Apparently he would go to an event with little kids running all around, and stand there, hunched shoulders, arms hanging at his side, and say “I’m the Noid” in monotone.\n\nOne of the drivers at the University store was from Africa (I don’t know which country) and pretty much kept to himself. Whenever we would make a crew pizza for dinner, he’d ask for anchovies on his slices. Half the time he would then eat a couple of the pieces without anchovies first. He gave the impression that he just didn’t understand the situation (there was a bit of a language barrier), but I’m not so sure. No one else liked anchovies, and he would end up with about half the pizza for himself.\n\nAt the El Cerrito store, one of the drivers surprised me one day by telling me he was actually a recording star in Ghana. He wanted to see the world and really get to know places, so he was traveling and stopping in places for a while, putting down some roots before moving on. I figure pizza delivery is kind of like being a cab driver in that way. Once Google happened, I looked him up and he was telling the truth. I learned that he had died a few years after I had known him, but he was indeed well known in the Highlife community. If anyone is interested, this is him (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Rogie). Hats off to you, Rogie, wherever you are…. I remember him being a really nice guy with a twinkle in his eyes.\n\nOne Summer the long-time manager of a store, Deb, was taking time off to get married, so they put me in to manage the store. There was an assistant manager at the store who had been there even longer than the store manager. Not long after I got there one or two of the drivers came to me to complain that they didn’t get credit for all of their deliveries on nights when the assistant manager was in charge. They had counted their deliveries and had, say, 12 in the night, but when it came time to check out, only had 10 slips on the hook (before computer ordering, everything was handled by tracking slips of paper). At first I didn’t believe him and just told him I’d look into it -- but after the second or third time, I took a good look at the order sheets. They all had serial numbers -- and numbers were missing. I told the area supervisor about this, and we pulled the saved sheets and sure enough, there were one or two missing sheets every night this guy worked. He would pull the sheets, pull the drivers tags, and pocket the money from those sales. A single sheet was 10 orders, and with prices what they were, that was probably $100 - $130. When they looked back through the sheets, he’d been doing this for more than a year. The owner arranged a sting. One night that this guy was working the owner arranged for ten or so volunteers to order pizzas -- I went to a friend’s house that was in the delivery area and ordered from there. We kept the copies of the slips on the pizza boxes. Sure enough, orders where placed and paid for that did not appear in the end of night paperwork. The guy ended up going to jail. I imagine this couldn’t really happen today -- computerized order tracking as well as credit card payment would make this impossible to get away with.\n\nOne of the assistant managers at the store had a couple of bandages on his face when I started working there. The story is that he had won a bunch of money in the lottery. He had partied hard, bought a sport-bike, and bought a slick Nissan 300ZX. Within just a couple of months, he totaled the sport-bike and no longer had it and had wrecked the 300ZX as well -- using the last of his winnings to get it repaired. And now here he was, a few months later, injured, worse for wear, and the only thing to show for his winnings was a car he probably could not afford to adequately insure.\n\nThere was a driver who had real claustrophobia and could not do elevators. He would tell the story of climbing twelve flights of steps to deliver a pizza up in Pacific Park Plaza. Whenever a delivery there came up for him, he would try hard to trade for another run -- and if he ended up having to take it, he either came back tired from the stairs, or pale from taking the elevator.\n\nThis guy was a jazz musician, and one time he needed a night off for something, and I was able to find someone to fill the schedule. I’ll never forget, he called me a “Beautiful Cat” in a cool-jazz kind of way.\n\nUp next, Culver City",
