        "text": "When my brother and I were little, McDonald's Happy Meals were a rare thing of great joy, only given in the back seat when we were traveling on long car trips.  We got them maybe 6 or 7 times a year.\n\nNot only did we get deliciously greasy food and a toy, but the cardboard boxes the Meals came in had puzzles and games and riddles.  The box was my favorite part.  It took me longer to get to my food because I would take the time to carefully open it, fold it flat, and save it, so that I could solve the puzzles later and draw on the plain cardboard back.\n\nMy little brother, on the other hand, would tear into his box with reckless abandon and wolf down his food.  Later in the day, he would see me solving the puzzles and would start whining.\n\n\"MooooooOOOOOOm, sweetalker isn't sharing.\"\n\nMom would scold me to share with my little brother.  Um, no.  He had one, identical to mine.  He tore it to pieces.\n\nNext time we got a Happy Meal, he had changed his approach.\n\n\"She's lyyyyyyying, mom.  This ripped up one is hers, she stole mine.\"\n\nAnd he would get my box.\n\nThis happened several times (he would wait a few tries to get my guard down, then do it again) before I came up with a more permanent solution.\n\nI saved my box, as usual.  But after folding it down, before I put it away, I wrote something on the plain cardboard side - something that couldn't be seen unless you unfolded it.  I then put it away and waited.\n\nA few hours after eating, I took out my box and looked over the puzzles.  I grinned really big so he would get jealous.\n\n\"moOOOOOOOM, sweetalker stole my Happy Meal box again!\"\n\n\"Shame on you.  Give it back to him, sweetalker.\"\n\nOkey-dokey.\n\nI waited a few minutes into his loud scribbling, then gasped.  \"Mom!  Mom!  Look what he wrote on his box!\"\n\nThere, neatly printed on the plain side of the cardboard, were the words \n\n\"FUCK U BITCH\"\n\nHe was not allowed Happy Meals for an entire year.  He was forced to get Fish Sandwiches instead, while I enjoyed my Happy Meals in piece.  To this day my brother still hates the taste of tartar sauce.",

Only problem being that it was a weird water gun with a bunch of noodle-things on the end that all flew around at random, so the water didn't really hit me much.\n\nBut I can't let any mildly-annoying-but-also-funny deeds go unpunished.\n\nImmediately after the water games ended, I grabbed a (more precise) water gun and ran inside, to our cooler, where most of the ice had melted. I then filled up the water gun with ice cold water, and walked back outside behind my aunt, took aim...\n\nand fired.\n\nIt was *all over* her shoulder and back for the rest of the day.

        "text": "This happened to me few month ago, but I've just discovered this sub. Just to contextualize, I'm French but live in another country.\n\nOne night, I'm going home by bus from a friend's place. Two stops from mine, two guys board the bus and sit in front of me. I think I heard them speak french, so I just take a peak at them, just out of curiosity. There is not so much french-speaking people outside of the high season.\n\nIt takes me maybe 15 seconds of listening to them to realize that they do speak french. At this point, they are talking about business and stuff. Out of curiosity again (and having nothing more to do), I quickly look in their direction again. The conversation being not interesting, I just discard it.\n\nTwo minutes later, I hear one of them say something like \"No, but this kind of girl...\" in a very disapproving manner. I'm almost the only one in the bus being a girl and it's a weird thing to say in the middle of a conversation about business stuff. But I'm not really sure that it's about me... and what for ? Because I looked at them ? But I cannot ask them directly, it's weird and they could deny it too easily.\n\nSo, I just pretended to receive a phone call and while I'm like \"Yeah sure, I'm on my way.\" (in french ofc), I see the two guys looking at each other, obviously kind of embarrassed. Needless to say, the look on their face was priceless and they didn't say a word until I left the bus.\n\n\nTL;DR: Living in a foreign country. Some people said not so nice things about me, in front of me in my native language. I pretended to take a phone call (in my native language) just to let them know I understood and let them feel stupid about themselves.",

        "text": "My fianc√© and I had been dating for four and a half years. In that time, we have bought a house together, adopted doggies together, I put him through pharmacy school (med school, and lots of people don't realize that pharmacists get their doctorates, or how competitive pharmacy can be), and we fell even more in love. He's an amazing man and I'm crazy about him.\n\nImagine my excitement that after braving all of the ups and downs and watching life unfold as a team, that he proposed. I was overjoyed and through tears of happiness I said yes! (And of course our doggies were involved.) It's a larger, slightly blush pink, amethyst stone with a halo of topaz around it set in rose gold. I loved it. It was perfect.\n\nThe next day, I was attending a baby shower for my best friend in my home town. I trekked my way there, and even though I tried to downplay the engagement because I wanted it to be about her, she made a mini announcement because I knew people who were there.\n\nMost people did a little congrats type thing, which was nice, except for her cousin. This girl, let's call her Amy, is super religious. Actually, everyone from my home town is super religious. And I appreciate their faith, but I didnt like her judgment. She has voiced her opinions before about how people shouldn't live together unless they're married and all that jazz. \n\nSo when she sauntered over, she took my hand in hers and scrutinized the ring. She more or less said that at least he was making an honest woman out of me and that he had taken too long to propose. Then she kind of scrunched her nose at my ring and asked what kind of stone it was, with a little, snobby, half-smile on her face. She also said that it was generic that he would ask me now that he's graduating because that's what \"everyone does\".\n\nI don't know what came over me. I love my ring and I've never been this mean girl, but I've known Amy for a while and shes always been like this. She likes to say what terrible decisions other people have made and how she always puts Jesus first, so that's why her life has turned out so well. She says it's because she has followed \"His plan\". Which ultimately led to her getting married ridiculously young to a guy who really isn't good for her at all and just leaches off of her. She had to put herself through school and work while he would go on long stints out of the country to \"find himself and follow God's path\", which I really think meant bang other women. She married him in the middle of a college year before one of the times he left, I suspect to entice him to come back and have commitments here.\n\nWell, I went for it. I said \"Oh, he waited until he knew he could provide for me. It's a pink diamond.\"\n\nHer whole face changed from smug to envious. She practically threw my hand down and mumbled how happy she was for me.\n\nI looked up how big my petty lie had been later, only to find out that yes, pink diamonds are actually a thing, and the teeny ones are like, $10,000.00!?! But hey, she doesn't have to know how poor we are! =D we are rich with unconditional love and loyalty, and that's why I'm happy to call him my future husband. &lt;3\n\nAddition:\nI'm brimming with pride and excitement to show you my ring! Thanks for all of your support and well-wishes! I hope it works.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/aarXela\n\nAnother Addition:\nY'all! Amy has got NOTHING on those imgur trolls XD OMG they are quick and SNAPPY! Glad I have so much support here. &lt;3\n\nThank you so much for the gold! ",

        "text": "Yesterday afternoon I encountered the most stereotypical ‚Äúd-bag driver in a convertible‚Äù during rush hour on one of the busiest streets of LA (Sunset Blvd). He ended up on my right after driving in and out of traffic without signaling! (I saw this from my mirrors) \n\nAt the right of the convertible was this man who clearly used his bicycle as his method of transportation. It was literally 90-100 degrees outside and he just looked worn out waiting at the light with us. Once the light went green, the driver literally stepped on his accelerator and his passenger threw out his cigarette, almost hitting the tired bicyclist. \n\nNot only was that upsetting to have witnessed, but this d-bag really had the nerve to cut me off to make it to the far left side to make a left turn, which I had to slam on my breaks to avoid (EDIT: him brake-checking me). My little pug was on my main passenger seat (she was safely secured, pls don‚Äôt comment on where she‚Äôs at) and she was frightened at the suddenly jerk of the car.\n\nThe driver and his passenger truly looked like they gave no fucks. So I didn‚Äôt either. Since the car cut me off to make it a left turn at another light, their car was pretty much cutting in front of the first car at the light who was trying to make a turn and kinda in my lane.\n\nI am not a typically vindicative person, and I‚Äôve experienced a lot of shit drivers on the road but guess what I luckily had at this time of event? A bag of my dog‚Äôs shit. She pooped at an area that had no trash cans and since I didn‚Äôt want to litter I brought the bag with me  so I could throw it away later. \n\nOnce the light turned green the convertible had to wait because there were other cars from the opposite direction accelerating as well. I slowly had to move my car to go around the convertible, threw my dog‚Äôs plastic bag of shit onto the passenger‚Äôs side, and drove off. Luckily the block in front of me had less cars and the traffic behind me would‚Äôve made it impossible for the convertible to have reached me. I‚Äôd like to thank that car for being my personal trashcan. This is why you don‚Äôt mess with people who don‚Äôt need more stress during rush hour.",

She was a shitty landlord, we had mold and water leaks and fleas and god knows what else, and she just wasn‚Äôt interested.\n\nShe insisted we use her shitty (and I mean *shitty*) WiFi and that we paid in the rent for it . For months. The wifi never actually reached the part of the house we stayed in, and when it did, it crapped out every other minute. I ended up hotspotting my phone on the regular just to use the PS4.\n\nAnyway. Eventually we got sick and tired of this shit and asked her if we could put a second line in, we‚Äôll pay. So she says sure, and we do.\n\nWe get the fastest, best fuckin wifi there is. Like, the difference was like getting glasses for the first time and realising trees actually have individual fucking leaves.\n\nRight up until she went in unannounced while we were at work, and stole the wifi password. We were still paying the extra in rent and paying for our own so I was pissed.\n\nAnd I know, I could have just changed the password. \n\nBut no. I am truly more petty and bitter than that.\n\nAfter all the shitty landlord things she had done, this was it. The final straw. So, I waited. Until I knew she was logged into our wifi on all of her devices.\n\nAnd then I blocked them through the router settings. Every single device she has went down at once. It was fucking glorious.\n\nEvery time she screeched at me about it I just shrugged, telling her that ‚Äúhey maybe it never reached through the walls properly.‚Äù\n\nAnd then we left, and she expected us to leave the router.\n\nNope. Ported it to our new home, and she‚Äôs still blocked. Every time she comes to visit our wifi is mysteriously down... but only for her.",

        "text": "Lengthy Post-TL;DR at the end\n\nA few years ago, it was my first year teaching. It was a fifth grade classroom, and overall, was a good learning year with great students. But‚Ä¶.there was one kid who was just an absolute asshole. I‚Äôll refer to him from this point as ‚ÄúAsshole Kid.‚Äù\n\nAsshole Kid was \\*that\\* kid who constantly bullied smaller kids, picked fights with anyone he wanted to, mocked his teachers to their faces (we switched classes so I didn‚Äôt have him all day, thank God), etc. etc.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was when he stole field trip money from a sweet kid whose family didn‚Äôt have a lot and, of course, lied about it.\n\nNow, we had gone through all the channels to try and correct behavior up to this point. We tried the ‚Äúreward him for good behavior‚Äù route. We wrote him up to the office, we conferenced with he and his mom. Nothing ever seemed to work for Asshole Kid.\n\nThere is only so much administration can do to handle Asshole Kid, so their hands became pretty much tied (at least according to them), so everyday Asshole would come to our classrooms, terrorizing other kids and being the rat he was. Something had to be done‚Ä¶I had to enact revenge in some way.\n\nAfter school one day, I swapped his desk with the absolute wobbliest one in the classroom. You all know that \\*one\\* desk. The one that can‚Äôt ever be level no matter how hard you try, the one you try in vain to stay still while you work, but it simply can‚Äôt be done. The one that raises your blood pressure to think about. Oh yeah, Asshole Kid got wobbly desk.\n\nFast Forward to the next day, and I watch with anticipation as he enters the room.\n\nMe: ‚ÄúOpen your writing folders to your stories.‚Äù\n\nAsshole Kid: sits at desk. Takes out nothing.\n\nMe: ‚ÄúKeep writing as I come to conference with some of you.‚Äù\n\nAsshole Kid: takes out paper to draw instead of write.\n\nCLANG CLANG CLANG\n\nThe desk starts banging against the floor with every stroke of his pencil.\n\nAsshole Kid: with a confused look, takes out another piece of paper to shove under a leg of the desk in hopes it will stop.\n\nCLANG CLANG CLANG\n\nThe paper slips from underneath the desk leg causing the desk to be just as wobbly as before. He tries this time to fold the paper around the bottom of the desk leg to keep it in place, but wobbly desk would have none of it.\n\nCLANG goes the wobbly desk as Asshole kid turns darker shades of red.\n\nAs I walk around the room in the guise of monitoring the writing, I am inwardly soaring watching Asshole Kid‚Äôs vain attempts to stop the wobbling. \n\nAlthough this definitely did not correct Asshole‚Äôs behavior, the 5-10 minutes I watched him try without success to fix his desk was worth the frustration I caused. If he even felt a fraction of the frustration he caused his parents, teachers, and administrators, I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat.\n\nTL;DR: Asshole student gets away with being an asshole, so I gave him the wobbliest desk in the classroom to cause him frustration.",

        "text": "I had some PS4 games listed on craigslist for $10 each. Yesterday a guy messages me about one of the games, in your typical deadbeat craigslist buyer style: horrible grammar, lots of broken language, asking questions clearly in the listing, making unreasonable requests, changing his mind repeatedly, etc. These are people i rarely think will actually follow through with buying something, so I typically just give them short answers and cut right to the chase with statements like \"price is firm, I can meet you &lt;here&gt;, let me know\"\n\nHe finally agrees to meet me, so I show up at the time he says, but still no idea if he's actually there or what he's driving or what he looks like. Random guy starts walking over to my car saying \"you got the video game?\" so I get out and say \"hey hows it going!\" and outstretch my hand for a handshake. He just thrusts a $10 bill at me while reaching for the game in my other hand... so I have to sort of juggle and reposition to grab the $10 and he yanks the game away and immediately starts walking off. Then as I'm acting bewildered and saying \"ok thanks!\" he just says *\"you're a jerk\"*. I say \"what?!\" and he says *\"you act like you're so good. I'm not going to shake your hand.\"* I just kinda stand there and say \"ok...\" and he shuts his door.\n\nOne thing about this is the guy clearly spoke perfect normal english, he didn't have an accent and wasn't foreign. He just chose to be the kind of person that messages like a middle schooler.\n\nJoke's on him because I only use Google Voice for internet dealings, and in GV his phone number automatically came up as a business name (i guess because his phone is linked to a business profile in google or something?). Turns out he's a real estate agent. I left him a negative review on Google for being unprofessional and unreasonable in a simple business matter. Take that! *pettiness intensifies*\n\nBonus justification? The guy was vietnamese. This isn't important, except my good friend and roomate is vietnamese and owns a vietnamese restaurant, so i told him the story and showed him the guy. Of course, my buddy says he knows his family and they are the type of very rude people that would come in to his restaurant, sit down, and yell their order at him immediately from across the room.",

        "text": "So, this happened this past weekend. I hate going to the grocery store, especially when it‚Äôs crowded. Especially when they are understaffed. Especially with a grouchy toddler. ESPECIALLY when people are needlessly rude and self entitled.\nSo I grab the few things I need and head to the register with my kiddo in tow. I get in the shortest line, as you do, and I quickly realize why the line is so short. The cashier, (a young girl, maybe 16/17) has a broken arm in a sling and is rapidly try to scan and bag this troll‚Äôs items as fast as she can. The following occurs. C will be cashier, T for troll ‚Äúlet me speak to your manager‚Äù biotch.\n\nT: Can‚Äôt you speed this up, you‚Äôre holding up the line! I can‚Äôt believe they put you on this register, I bet even with two working arms, you‚Äôd still be a slow dumbass.‚Äù\n\nC: I‚Äôm sorry ma‚Äôam, we will get you loaded and on your way in just a moment. \n*smiles the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying inside but they pay me to be polite‚Äù smile\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm getting my countless responses ready for this lady. But then I see it: the glorious cheaply made chalice of self inducing karma.\nYou see, this troll had put her purse on the child seat of her cart, pretty precariously tipping towards the back of the cart. I say nothing and watch this unfold.\n\nT: REALLY? After all of that you‚Äôre not going to double bag my eggs?? You really should‚Äôve stayed in school hunny, because no ones going to hire you if you are that DUMB!\n\nC: I‚Äôm so sorry m‚Äôam, I‚Äôll do that right away. \n\nAnd then it happens. The troll jerks her cart forward in indignation, and the purse comes tumbling out. Every loose coin, every tube of whore red lip stick, every receipt, every GOD DAMN stick of gum jolts out of this woman‚Äôs purse like confetti. \nShe is shocked and looks at me as if I am the one who dared to touch her belongings. But I am far enough back that it couldn‚Äôt possibly have been me. She lets out a mouthy grunt and begins scooping everything back into her overpriced, knock off purse. It takes longer than she anticipated, and becomes a little frantic trying to get everything in the purse and exit the line. The cashier takes this moment to quickly load her items into her cart and has the receipt out waiting for her.\n‚ÄúHave a great day!‚Äù She says with a bit of smugness. As I pull forward with my cart, with the woman still within earshot, I casually said to the cashier, ‚Äúmaybe she should‚Äôve gone back to school to learn zippers work.‚Äù The cashier beams at me, and the troll slumps away after shooting me a shitty glance. My kiddo got two stickers from the lovely cashier, and we went on our way. ",

        "text": "I live in a house that is off of a main road and has no connection to the neighborhood behind me outside of my backyard. The \"neighborhood association\" requires me to pay $250 a year to them for things like snow plowing and upkeep, neither of which I benefit from. I've been annoyed by it for years but, per my wife's request, I've never turned it into an issue. The other day I'm walking my dogs in the neighborhood and the lady that heads the association see me and my dogs and cautiously approaches me with 2 other women I recognize because they live near her. She says \"excuse me sir, are those pitbulls?\" with a horridly bitchy attitude that is only fueled by the scoffing of the ladies behind her. I politely tell her yes and that they are twin brothers. \n\nNow I'll say this: I understand the stigma behind pitbulls so when I adopted them as puppies I put them through very advanced training. You can put a raw steak at their feet and they won't budge until you give them permission. As the lady tells me that they don't allow my breed of dog, she has her two huskies chained to a tree behind her and they are going INSANE. They are barking horridly loud and pulling themselves so hard that they are choking as mine sit quietly. Annoyed, I smile and tell her to hold on because I can't hear her. I then start raddling off a ridiculous amount of commands to my dogs and they follow every word flawlessly. \"Sit, stand, sit, down, stand, down, stand, down, etc.\" I just blankly stared at her and kept loving on my dogs and finished with a \"wait\" (i.e. stay and don't budge) and tossed a treat on the ground that they didn't attempt to eat.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have a cool \"one-liner\" to finish the whole ordeal, but I politely told her that they were very well trained, are registered with the  city and won't be an issue. I smiled, gave the dogs permission to eat the treats and walked away as she looked embarrassed and had nothing more to say. ",

We have a bunch of no parking and private entrance signs up, but drivers will continue to park in front of our driveway, making it difficult for us to exit.\n\nOn this particular day, I was leaving for work in the afternoon when I spotted a box truck parked in the middle of our driveway. Usually people will park on the stones to the side of the driveway, which while still illegal, allows us to exit. This time, however, the the driver decided to block us from leaving completely. With the owners nowhere to be found, I took pictures and called the police. 30 minutes go by, and before the towtruck could arrive, the owners come back. I explained to them that they blocked me for 30 minutes, and while laughing, they explained that they wanted to go eat some ice cream.\n\nNow, I'm usually a very calm person, but blocking me from going to work for 30 minutes for ice cream really grinds my gears. They finally move, and I go to work. But I was pissed. I decided to file a formal complaint with my city about this truck driver.\n\nToday, the person in charge of traffic violations of my city happily told me that they have followed and escalated my complaint towards the relevant authorities, and have sent the owners a notice of traffic violation, as well as a fine.\n\nTL;DR: Block me from going to work so you can eat some ice cream?

        "text": "This happened two weeks ago. To preface this, I'm a big coffee nut for its taste as a beverage, not for the kicks or caffeine dosage - too much coffee gives me severe headaches for days. Thus I get VERY particular about the taste, since I can't have more than a cup every two days.\n\nA few months ago I moved from using instant coffee to grinding and brewing with my own beans (best decision ever, f\\*\\*k instant coffee). I don't have a fancy espresso machine nor can I afford one anytime soon, so I use a French Press/cafetiere, add coffee filters to its bottom and squeeze out my \"espresso\" shots, which aren't as strong but still get most of the flavor. I always try to get the temperature right as boiling water ruins the coffee's taste, this is important for context.\n\nNow my sister is a food junkie who often wants to try new things and stuff. This one time she called me up because she wanted something fancy to drink but couldn't find any place that would deliver to our area (we live in the same neighborhood). I offered to make her some cold coffee with vanilla and mint, which she gladly agreed. I set out, painstakingly brewing shots for 3 glasses of cold coffee (for her and her husband, and a little extra), blending them with vanilla, milk, cream, ice and mint flavor. It came out glorious after nearly an hour of effort. She came over to pick it up, and called me later thanking profusely.\n\nCue the actual incident. It's the weekend and the football semifinals are about to start. Just five mins into England vs Croatia my sister calls me up and tells me she's coming over for some stuff and would like to have some cold coffee again. I tell her I'm watching the Cup so it'll have to wait. That doesn't quite suit her mood and she goes on a typical Asian-elder tirade over how ungrateful and selfish younger people are and how we can't respect elders or honor their wishes, counting all the times she's gone out of her way to help me and what not.\n\nSo me being Asian and hardwired that way, I tell her to pick up her coffee when she's over (while I watch the match on my phone). I go about brewing the coffee, but instead of using just the cafetiere, I BOIL THE COFFEE GRINDS like tea, really let them sizzle and bubble, then I press them through the cafetiere and make the rest of the coffee.\n\nI also added extra sugar, no cream and too little vanilla flavoring to make it less wholesome. Enjoy your burnt, cardboard-tasting coffee.\n\nShe still called me up and thanked me later that night.\n\ntl;dr sister demanded I make her some specialty coffee, I burnt it out of spite",

        "text": "So first, you need a bit of context. I am a writer and a games developer. I was 19 years old but I do have a baby face. I had coursework due the next day and I was getting a train down to London. It is a long trip and I specifically reserved a seat with a table. \n\nSo I had my laptop and my notebook, as well as a small travel bag. Nothing much. I managed to get on the train about 5 minutes early and began searching for my seat. When I got there, my seat was taken by a business man. I quickly said that it was my seat, but he insisted that he only had one stop and had very important business that he needed to do. I could already smell the BS, but I agreed, taking the seat behind him that had no access to a table. \n\nWe are about 30 minutes into the trip when I am getting annoyed. He has sat there reading a news paper and sipping a coffee at the table that I needed. I got up, put my notebook and laptop on the table, and asked him to move. He rolled his eyes and loudly announced that I was an annoying little brat that didn't understand true work ethic. During his little rant, his hand 'accidentally' bumped against his coffee, sending it over my notebook, laptop and my white shirt. I was furious. 9 chapters of a book was in my notebook, as well as indepth character analysis. My laptop was a gift for getting into university. He took one look at me, up and down, and just laughed. He said it was my fault for being a brat. \n\nBy this point, the entire train car was listening to our little tat. I was near tears. A woman was kind enough to get up and berate him, giving me her jacket and offering me food. She was lovely. She helped me salvage what I could of my notebook. Luckily, my laptop didn't get any coffee in. The man that was opposite to my devil lent down, spreading his legs far so the man was trapped in his seat. Someone moved behind him and pressed his legs against the back of the guys chair so he could feel it. My personal petty revenge on his man didn't come for another year. \n\nI was once again heading down to London to see my sister. I didn't need a seat with a table as I was already on summer break. But then I saw him at the end of the platform. Now, I am not proud of what I did. But it felt so good at the time. His train ticket fell out of his pocket and fluttered to the floor. And I. Did. Nothing. I smirked as I walked past him, heading to the train door. I don't think he recongised me, but gods it felt good. The conductor came through and checked our tickets around 20 minutes in. I had positioned myself so I could watch the entire thing go down. The man got in a shouting match with the conductor, yelling about how important he was and that he shouldn't even have to pay for a ticket. It was so fun to watch and just get this small bit of petty revenge on a man. He got kicked off at the next stop and the police were called due to the man assaulting the conductor. \n\nTldr: man refused to move from my seat, gets kicked off a train and gained a police record a year later.",

Writing on mobile during my layover, so sorry if formatting sucks.\n\n\nSo I'm finishing my couple of weeks in Spain with my SO and we're heading to Italy next. The quicker and cheaper way to get there is by plane, and our first flight was only 30 minutes from Valencia to Madrid before we can go on our next one to Naples.\n\n\nNow, I would hope most people know that it is rude to play your collection of music for every stranger around you to hear (unless you're a musician and are actually being hired and paid to do that). I knew this at the very least in high school-- a handful of times, I'd forgotten my earbuds when I'd rush out the door to catch my bus and I'd have to endure the country music station on my hour-long ride (both ways) to school. Would I have rather listened to my own music? Yes, but I didn't want to disturb others around me and be /that/ person.\n\n\nSo, we've only JUST stabilized in the air for this quick flight when I hear some cover version of \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" about two or three rows behind us. I can't see who this stranger is, but in my mind I'm picturing a middle-aged woman because who else would blast some bastardization of Cyndi Lauper? My annoyance is growing as this song progresses past the first chorus.\n\n\nI decide I want to drown out her music by plugging in my headphones and just tuning her out. As I'm looking down and getting them out of my bag, I mutter to my SO something like \"why? Who decides to play their music like that?...Gah, I wish I could just blast some System of a Down to get back at them.\" My man nudges my arm and I look up- he's already scrolling through his SoaD playlist and I smile (it still surprises me sometimes that we get the same ideas at the same time- but that's to be expected after almost 4 years together--- funny story, a couple weeks into our relationship, he handed me his phone and asked me to pick the next song for us to listen to... when I chose \"Prison Song\" I think he began to fall in love with me lol)\n\n\nI'm too introverted/shy/socially anxious to actually carry something that petty and disturbing out, but my SO doesn't care. He starts playing \"B.Y.O.B.\" on full blast- obviously this brings stares from everyone who is near us; and I get pretty embarrassed and move my face towards the window. He only plays it for between maybe 10-15 seconds, holding his phone almost to the ceiling of the plane. He stops the music some time after the \"YOU!!!!\", but before the first shrill scream about sending the poor. \n\n\nAnd then.... Silence. There's no music, not a peep. I'm no longer hearing about females and their desire for amusement. I smile and kiss my man on the cheek before plugging in my headphones and blissfully listening to tunes on Spotify. We didn't hear anything else for the remainder of the time we were in the sky.\n\n\nSilence truly is golden.\n",

You were supposed to save some for the rest of the day.\nK: but you have Jooce \nMe: i do have juice but you need to slow down before you have go to the pot pot\nK: I can get it myself if you don want to \nMe: and you can go sit down because I want you to\nK: *looks at me and walks away for a while\n\n he is a pretty behaved kid; so I turn back to my work. he goes back into the living room to watch tv. I become focused in my work and then I hear the fridge open. I turn around and this little boy had grabbed my juice out the fridge and tried to open it. I grabbed it from him and he began to roll his eyes at me. So I gave him exactly what he wanted. I had a large polar pop cup (huge extra large cup) \n\nMe: you want to drink some Jooce don‚Äôt you\nK: yes \nMe: alright I will let you have some but I need you go to the potty first\nK: yes!\n\nAs he goes to the bathroom; I pour a small amount of juice mixed in with tons of water in the cup. The cup is overflowing and I pass it too him. I watch his little twinkling eyes cringe as he took a sip\n\nK: this not Jooce! Give me something else\nMe: yes it is and I am not giving you anything else\n\nHe looks at me like I had three heads and runs off with the cup. For the rest of the day I don‚Äôt hear another peep about Juice from him. When his mom came she wanted to know how I got him to stop asking me. I just smiled and said he had enough. \n\nBtw: I love my baby cousin but I am not about to give him everything because he wants otherwise he would have wet his clothes and she forgot to bring a spare change of clothes. \n\n",

        "text": "I thought you guys might enjoy this tale of how I got a lady banned from the best doctors place in our area. Think \"can I speak to your manger\" but add a bunch of years. Like ... 60ish. Old people seem to act a bit entitled.\n\nOne day, my Father and I went to visit our local doctor. Everyone loves him, its unreal. He has the biggest amount of clients within like a 100km radius easy. People travel from an hour a way to see him. He is just that nice and friendly. Plus he has been studying while working so he is a specialist in certian fields. Him being so well loved means that even it you book in, you can still be waiting for at least and hour and a half, without fail. Its the normal. Of course there are other doctors people can see but nope, everyone waits for him.\n\nDad and I sit down and on my right side is the woman I described above. Really short white hair, nice handbag and rings all over her fingers. You know the type I'm talking about. So after about five minutes she starts looking at her watch and sighing in that \"I'm angry, someone ask me what is wrong so I can complain\" type of attention seeking sigh. I almost make eye contact with her but nope, I'm a bit anxious so eye contact is a no. I lean to my side and mumble to my Dad that the old betty is getting grumpy and he makes some remark that has me laughing. After a few more minutes she starts tapping her foot and her nails on her phone cover. I get it, you don't like waiting. No one does but shit, you picked this doctor so suck it up.\n\nAfter maybe a tops of fifteen minutes she gets up and marches to the front desk, which is high and its almost taller than this old bitty is and slams down her bag before speaking in a high yet breathy \"I'm important\" voice.\n\n\" Excuse me?! Excuse me? HELLO!\" Getting a little louder, demanding she is seen to right now even though the ladies behind the desk are on the phones, which never stop ringing because as I said, popular af doctor. And the damn ladies back there are nice as, I've know them since they started there when I was in Highschool. It's like don't demand attention from people on the phones!\n\n\"I've been waiting for ages! When am I going in?!\" Bitch its been like 15 mins, calm your fucking shit. Plus she is being rude and is getting louder. Dad and I are giving each other the side eye because this old betty is being annoying and rude in a normal chill waiting room.\n\nI think the Doc heard her being a twat so he walks out and calls her in. She is in there for about five minutes and comes stomping back out, slams her bag on the desk again and snaps, I shit you not, snaps her wrinkly old twiggy fingers at the ladies behind the desk asking if she needs to pay for something and when they say no, she turns and stomps towards the door. As she leaves, her phone rings on loud and she answers it, because of course. And starts with \"You can not imagine the amount of time I had to wait to get a stupid needle! \" and continues to rant loudy as she slams out the door. Screen and wooden. Everyone in the waiting room shares a glance and its finally calm. Fuck yeah.\n\nAfter a while we get called in and even though he knows me and has since I was like 10, he shakes my hand and makes a joke and ask how I am and before I've even sat down my big mouth has started.\n\n\"Did you know that old lady was snapping at the girls while they were on the phone?\"\nHe sits down now and gives me a look, as if he is curious and my Dad chimes in.\n\"The one making all that noise before you came and got her?\"\n\nAh, there is it. Doc's eyebrows scrunch a bit and he kind of exhales, he knows exactly who we mean. \n\nDoc: \"She was snapping at them? What do you mean snapping?\" English isn't his first and he is very literal.\n\nMe: \"Snapping her fingers. Clicking. Because they were busy on the phones. She was also complaining that she had been waiting for so lonnnnnggggg.\" Drawn out to shown it clearly wasn't true.\n\nDoc: \"She clicked at them? While they were busy?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah and slamming her damn ugly purse on the counter.\" said with distain.\n\nBefore I can even continue bitching about the old croon, Doc is up and out the door of the room. Dad and I share a look of wtf and after a few minutes he comes back. Before I can even ask where he want, the Doc starts speaking.\n\nDoc: \" She already had her appotiment. An hour ago. She needed something so I gave her the script and told her she would need another appotiment.\"\n\nMe: \"So why was she back in here?\"\n\nDoc: \"Because I said I'd fit her in quickly because it was just a shot.\"\n\nSo, not only had this bitch literally been seen already, but the Doc had then let her pop back in, infront of a line of people and this old bitch complained for waiting for 15 MINUTES! And harrased the staff. Like what kind of bullshit.\n\nDoc got back up and stuck his head out the door, its near the back of the front desk and I hear him say \n\"Call her and tell her we don't stand for that kind of thing here. She was rude to you guys. I don't want to see her here again. For any of the doctors. Tell he she isn't allowed back. Ever.\"\nMic drop everyone. Then he closed the door and started our appotiment.\n\nSo that's how me being a big mouthed bitch an complaning about that dusty old vagina revealed that she was in fact, beyond rude and not apprecative of the Doc being kind and got banned from the best Doctors surgery in the whole area.\n\nEdit: I am getting a lot of messages about how Doc should not of told us that she was there for a shot. That it was personal. I do agree on that matter and honestly just think in a moment of shock that she had been rude expressed that in stating information about said woman. A shot could be a million different things and he was still pretty vauge, but I hear your statements and understand.",

We'll call him Ken.\n\nSo in high school in America we have AP classes that have a relatively higher workload than other on-level classes. So for AP US History, we were tasked with making a PowerPoint over something I don't remember. The point is that this was a group project where the groups were given to us randomly.\n\nSo of course Ken and like four other people had to make this powerpoint. Unfortunately all of them turned out to be slackers and leeching, steaming piles of crap. So Ken did the entire project.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he did it well.\n\nOf course he made his own slide well, but he added incorrect and just hilariously wrong information to the other slides of the slideshow. I thinks it's safe to say that the slackers, who expected to get a 100 from just reading off these premade slides were less than happy.\n\nOur teacher, being chill and all that handled it well and I don't think the other group members got very good grades.\n\nSadly though, I had this same problem with my group and to this day, I regret not telling the teacher. Still very salty about spending hours on that stupid project.\n\nTldr: Friend was in a group full of slackers so he finished their slides incorrectly and made them unknowingly present wrong information to the whole class and teacher on presentation day.\n",

        "text": "Tl; dr at the bottom. \n\nMy roommate and I live in an old Victorian house that was converted into apartments downtown. We rent the entire downstairs for the unit and upstairs is a four bedroom boarding house. \n\nThe upstairs neighbors keep to themselves for the most part. With the exception of their pests. So when we found one crawling on the walls, we called the property manager immediately. A week and a half later, I got a call from--let's call him Sam, because frankly, he doesn't deserve anonymity. Scheduled an appointment for 1PM with his company and didn't think anything else of it. \n\nI took off of work and my roommate came home early from college to make sure we were both home for the visit. We tidied up a bit and waited. \n\n&gt;30 minutes past the hour: *Okay, maybe they're late. I'll call.* Called, left a short voicemail with my name, address, and phone number.\n\n&gt;1 hour late: *My lunch break is up and I need to drive her back to campus. Better call again and call the property manager.*\n\n&gt;1 hour and a half late: Finally got a call back and was told that, \"Well I'm behind.\" No call beforehand, misgendered my deep voice, and said he'd \"be here when he got here.\" \n\nOkay, no. That wasn't what we agreed to. I can afford to take the time off of work and she doesn't have to be back to school for another hour but our time is not worthless. \n\nI asked her to call back and cancel the appointment but to wait about ten minutes until he was closer. Friends, this man is a business owner; supposedly. He *screamed* at my poor roommate. Told her that, \"...if this were a perfect world, we would be there. But we're not the cable company, we're not on time.\" \n\nNope. You do *not* talk to her that way and then expect to come into our home. I picked up the phone and called the property manager, explained the situation on her voicemail, and immediately sent an email. All of these things are time stamped and dated. \n\nFive minutes later, his truck is parked between our cars on the curb and I get a call from the property manager. Sweet woman that she is, she asked why we would refuse pest control. I explained what had happened and she asked if we would be ok with another company. Which I happily agreed to. Was told that she would \"take care\" of Sam and his company. \n\nWouldn't you know it, Sam the \"businessman\" sat in front of our apartment and even tried our doorknob for a full fifteen minutes before turning away while we sat inside with the curtains drawn. \n\nJust after dinner time I got an email from the property manager thanking me for the feedback. They explained that the behaviour was outside of the lines of what their company deems acceptable. That they will be cancelling services with them further. Turns out they were supposed to spray all of the apartments at the same time and certainly not two weeks later! I enjoyed a nap, with the piece of mind that this scumbag has lost all business with one of the larger property management companies in the area. \n\nTl; dr: Pest control company is an hour and a half late. Roommate called to cancel and was yelled at by the owner. Called the property management company and cost him all business with them in the future. ",

        "text": "I currently have the pleasure of working with a one-upper. Everyone knows this person, even if the terminology is a little different. They essentially can‚Äôt let you enjoy an accomplishment without telling you how they‚Äôve done the exact same thing ‚Äì only better. Praised at work? They were also recognized at work, and the CEO was so impressed with them they are now basically besties! Had a great weekend off? They had a mini-vacation this weekend that would blow your mind! Did well in school this semester? They did too, in fact they are a straight A student! This story revolves around the last situation.\n\nI want to first clarify that my co-worker, who I will now refer to as‚Ä¶ Becky, is a very nice person. Becky is kind, generous, thoughtful, and almost single handedly one of the most annoying people on the planet. Because Becky is currently in school (as am I) every story somehow comes back to her academic accomplishments. Fun fact: Becky is on the HONOR ROLL! She is also a STRAIGHT A STUDENT with JOB OFFERS IN HER FIELD once she graduates. I know these things because for the last year and a half, Becky has told me this at least twice a week, with an extreme emphasis on her straight A status. When I started in my program, I mentioned that I was relieved a class went well. She quickly reminded me that she had already completed that class and had also done well. In fact, the class went so well that she became the teacher‚Äôs favorite student, and if Becky wanted to, she could have a great letter of reference in a heartbeat. At a later date I mentioned that I had finished all my homework for the week and was excited to have a little free time. Becky, of course, had also finished her homework and was going to go to Vegas that weekend to celebrate how well school was going. When I tried to give a shift away because I had a big school project coming up, Becky gave away two shifts because her course load was so large it was a miracle she could work and attend classes at all. Don‚Äôt worry about Becky too much though, her time management skills were off the charts and she was still going to get amazing grades. This same phenomenon had been occurring for so long that I had resigned myself to Becky mysteriously being better at everything I mentioned ever.\n\nWhile all of the above is slightly annoying, I have to confess that part of the issue was Becky‚Äôs choice of subject matter. Despite my own accomplishments in school, I find it particularly annoying when people brag about grades because they aren‚Äôt necessarily a reflection of your abilities in the real world. Bragging about grades also has the added benefit of making people who don‚Äôt do well despite working hard feel awful. Test taking is a skill (which no one cares about once you graduate), and it plays a huge role in whether or not you can get A‚Äôs. I have many friends who struggle with the bureaucratic nightmare that is school, and I tend to get defensive on their behalf. Constantly hearing about Becky being a straight A student is irritating on multiple levels and I find it incredibly difficult to care about her GPA. It‚Äôs one thing to mention you did well in school, it‚Äôs another to bludgeon your listening audience with the fact that you are an academic superstar at every available opportunity. I had taken to actively avoiding her at work because I value my sanity. Fortunately, Becky will be out of my life soon enough because she just graduated. It‚Äôs a big world, and I‚Äôm sure she will find someone else to annoy shortly.\n\nIf I was a good person, the story would not exist because annoying people are depressingly common, and most people have developed strategies to deal with them; however, I am not a good person. I am a petty one. So, when Becky was about to graduate, meaning everyone else had to know everything about her graduation and be excited with her, I enacted my subtle (but petty) revenge. For months Becky bragged about her graduation party set-up, all the people who were coming into town to watch her walk, the amazing car she received as a graduation gift, basically anything and everything that could possibly be mentioned about graduation was discussed at length with any available audience. On the fateful day the petty revenge took place, she was bragging about her honors cord. \n\nIf you‚Äôve never heard of an honors cord, that is completely reasonable. It is essentially a tassel worn around your neck when you graduate that denotes your academic accomplishments (read: high GPA). Every school has a different system, but at my university the color options are pretty specific with different colors representing different GPA ranges. A gold cord show that a student had a 3.9 GPA or higher, a silver cord showed that a student‚Äôs GPA was between a 3.7 ‚Äì 3.89, and a red and white cord showed that a student had received a 3.5 ‚Äì to 3.69. This means that a student receiving a high B average would receive a cord, since an A at this university was equal to a 3.7. To be clear, an honor cord is just that, an honor, and it‚Äôs not easy to receive one at all. However, there is definitely a good-better-best aspect to the honor cord system. Additionally, there is an entirely separate cord for students who went through the honors program, which shows that they took even more difficult coursework while maintaining a high GPA.\n\nCords are a small part of graduation, but of course, Becky couldn‚Äôt resist telling everyone all about her graduation outfit (it‚Äôs a black cap and gown, how exciting can it be?) specifically mentioning her red and white honors cord. While I did my best to tune her out, my ears perked up at this information. Becky had mentioned her straight A status many, many times and a red and white cord is not indicative of straight A‚Äôs. Becky, while being incredibly annoying, was also proving that she was a lying liar face. So I did what any reasonably petty person would do, I feigned interest until I could ask questions that would give me the most petty satisfaction. I listened to the BS about how high quality her robe was, how the stole really complemented her eyes (it‚Äôs a big piece of fabric that drapes over your neck with a logo on it, it‚Äôs not exciting in any way, shape, or form - but now you know), and then we discussed the honor cord. I asked detailed questions about when and where she bought it, how it looked, and the color scheme before going in for the kill. It‚Äôs a simple thing, but I asked if there were any other colors for honor cords. I saw her eyes widen, before she conceded that there were other honor cord colors available. I then asked her countless questions about the honor cord system, and once we had covered that in exhausting detail, I confusedly asked why she only had a red a white cord. I acted shocked that her cord wasn‚Äôt silver or gold and followed this information up with questions about the cord she would be wearing to show she was in the honors program. Becky was not in the honors program which produced an even more incredulous reaction from me. Oh, you're not on the honors track? Isn‚Äôt it easier to get an honors cord when you are taking the easier, non-honors classes? So, you only need a B average to get an honors cord? I thought you were a straight A student? By the end of my questions the light had died in her eyes, a small piece of her embarrassed by her honor cord color. Over the course of one conversation she had gone from elated about graduating with honors to being ashamed of graduating so poorly.\n\nBecky eventually recovered, because that‚Äôs what humans do, but for one blissful week she didn‚Äôt say a word to me or talk to anyone at all about graduation. It was delicious.\n\nTL;DR In an additional act of pettiness, my submission is long ass story with a shitty recap. Think of it as a twofer. You‚Äôre welcome.\n",

        "text": "My husband and I have been married for going on 8 years and whilst I love him dearly, he has one major flaw - he's incredibly greedy with his food. For the duration of our 11 year relationship he's always put himself first when it comes to mealtimes. \n\nWhen he cooks dinner he always makes sure he gets the biggest portion or the slice of lasagne with the most cheese on, the non-burnt half of the pizza... The list goes on I assure you. If I'm the one cooking, he swoops in while I'm just plating it up, takes a second to compare plates and quickly makes off with the best one. It drives me insane.\n\nAfter 11 years of down-trodden-ness I finally snapped about 2 weeks ago. My husband went to the deli on his way home from work and got one of them freshly made up pizzas that you you then take home and cook yourself. It was 12\" - which should have been big enough for me, my husband and our 2 small children to share. It should have meant Friday night dinner was sorted. \n\nThe thing is, as I've previously pointed out, my husband is greedy. My husband denies that what happened next was intentional. I don't believe him. I believe my husband entered that deli with the sole intent of ensuring that he got as much of that pizza as possible to himself. My husband entered the deli. He ordered that pizza with half pepperoni and half chicken and mushroom.\n\nNeither myself or our two small children like mushrooms. At all. There were so many pieces of mushroom on that half of the 12\" pizza that you couldn't see anything else. The mushrooms were chopped up so tiny that any attempt to pick them out of the cheese would have been futile. The end result was that me and the kids were forced to share half a 12\" pepperoni while my husband enjoyed the entire other half.\n\nSo unbelievably hacked off was I, that I decided it was time to get even. A friend suggested I do the same thing to him next time I buy a pizza. But the trouble is that my husband likes EVERYTHING as is usually the way with greedy husbands. I needed a different tac...and then it hit me...\n\nSo I've spent the last two weeks getting even with him, hitting him where it hurts - in the food cupboard. I've spent the last two weeks finishing all his favourite foods and snacks and then putting the empty packets back in the cupboard for him to find. I finished off his marmite. I finished his peanuts. I fed his salami to the dog. \n\nI made strawberry pudding for me and the kids last night and shared the whole lot out between the three of us. When my husband asked where his was I feigned innocence and said \"oh sorry I thought you said you didn't want any\"\n \nAnd the look on his face when he came home and found me eating the last of his bacon this morning - priceless! \n\nEdit because lots of people are saying I don't communicate with my husband, and I'm passive aggressive etc. I have pulled him up on this behaviour countless times over the years. He usually stops for a week or so before the behaviour creeps back in. He grew up as the oldest of 3 kids so I'm guessing the behaviour stems from that. \n\nI did lose it with him about the pizza and he said he didn't do it on purpose and said he thought the kids wouldn't want any. However, I didn't believe his story because we both know the kids love pizza. \n\nI probably am being passive aggressive but the direct approach got me nowhere. ",

That wouldn't be too bad if all the significant others weren't slobs. \n\nMy food would constantly disappear. Now I'm not super protective, like if you want some butter then take some. But these people would take eggs and bananas. They would even open up my food before I could take it out of the package. \n\nThe other part is I would be the only one who cleans one of our two bathrooms. I tried seeing how bad my roommate would let it get and the trash was overflowing and the room smelled like piss. \n\nI stopped paying utilities because of all of this and they, I lived with a brother and sister and the bills were in their name, didn't think it was fair. They said those weren't good reasons to not pay and threatened to take me to court. Now I was friends with these people, but if you threaten legal action that throws the whole relationship out the window in my eyes. They changed the wifi password and took all the pots and pans away, so I caved and paid. They also wanted an advance for the next month with a little discount so I paid that too. \n\nThis is were my little petty revenge comes into place. Since the lease is ending, I don't have anymore electric bills because I paid in advance. Every chance I could I set the AC to 50¬∞f and left everything I could on. I am trying to get this electric bill as high as I can so they have to pay a huge bill. I also moved out early and took all the food in the fridge no matter who it belonged to. \n\nI wanted to do so much more but I didn't want to go overboard. \n\nTLDR: my roommates were slobs, stole food, and made me prepay the electric bill, so I am making the electric bill as high as possible.

        "text": "I work a normal 8-5 schedule and am usually up by 6am to walk the dogs and get the day started. My roommate, on the other hand, works evenings as a waiter and it's not unusual for him to come home past midnight, especially on service industry nights when him and coworkers all hit the bars. Then he gets to sleep in till noon while I'm heading out to work. Normally he's pretty good about staying quiet but on this night I got woken up at 4am (on a Monday morning) to the loud boom of an \"artillery shell\" firework, and then another. And then one more for good measure. Since I couldn't get back to sleep before I normally wake up, I spent time thinking about petty revenge. Right before I left for work I put a wet towel into the (very) squeaky dryer near his room and then asked Alexa to start playing fireworks sounds at full volume 2 hours later (yes there is a fireworks \"skill\" that Alexa can learn).\n\nSo he'll probably have to stop the dryer or listen to it squeak for an hour. And then about the time he's back asleep, Alexa starts playing firework sounds at full volume and directed at his room, for 20 minutes straight. And by then the dogs will be up and awake and be wanting out of crates and outside and such. I left for work a little less agitated than I was before.\n\nUPDATE: Went home for lunch and the roommate hasn't emerged from the  lair yet. I did a quick Alexa test run and it definitely played a full  blast Alexa alert, but NOT the fireworks sounds :(  I'm sure it still  woke him up though, because that speaker is LOUD and that alert is  pretty annoying. In addition to not bothering to shoosh the puppy's  barks while I was there, I steamed some broccoli to eat later. He HATES  that smell and I usually avoid cooking it when he's home. But not today  rocket man. Have fun basking in the smell of wet farts when you wake up!\n\nUPDATE2: A fair amount of people seem to think I've acted inappropriately. First, let me remind you what sub we are in. Second, we are old friends and of course I'm going to talk to him. We have opposite schedules so lunch was my only chance today. He wasn't available, so I added a slightly noxious element to it for  bonus karma. Third, it is a really shitty thing to set off fireworks at 4am in a neighborhood. Some of you are acting like I took a shit in his cereal. ",

        "text": "Several years ago, I was working as a phlebotomist (glorified vampire) in a hospital in a smallish city. As with all cities, this one has its share of homeless. \n\nOne night, I was working the ER and a homeless woman came in complaining of severe back pain. She was a known frequent flier in the ER, but not because she was an addict or manipulative. She was a diabetic with bad kidneys. \n\nShe was homeless because she was schizophrenic and extremely paranoid. Her mental health was deteriorating with her failing kidneys. She was obese, and had been an IV drug user for many years, though clean for about 5 years at the time, and was a very hard stick (hard stick = someone who has hard to access veins for drawing blood). We‚Äôll call her Meg for this story. \n\nI was working with my favorite ER tech, who we‚Äôll call Ralph. Ralph was not having a good day and when Meg came in, he decided to leave me alone with her. Now, Meg likes to talk, and this was my first interaction with her, so Ralph said he‚Äôd be right back and left me to get my blood sample. What Ralph failed to mention is that this woman has huge issues with being appropriate and is supposed to have 2 people in the room with her at all times because she likes to make false accusations as well. Nevertheless, Ralph proceeds to leave me alone with her anyway\n\nMeg, being homeless, hadn‚Äôt showered in what could have been weeks, and the door to her room had to be kept shut to keep others in the ER from getting sick off her smell. Meg decides to tell me her life story as I am checking every where to find some sort of vein to get some blood. Well, Meg likes to think of her life as a story book and uses her tattoos as her illustrations. Hey, I have some tats myself and I am happy to admire the artwork, so I made small talk while I looked for a vein. This woman had nothing I could find, so I was getting ready to get Ralph and see if we could place an IV and get blood that way. Well, Meg decided she wants to show me her newest tattoo!\n\nShe proceeded to pull up her hospital gown, spread her thighs, and the green cloud that emanated from her likely would have gagged even those with the strongest constitutions! She then reaches down, grabs the inside of her thigh and shows me this fresh (INFECTED) tattoo that says ‚ÄúFor a sweet ride, insert $ here‚Äù with an arrow pointing towards her ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù. \n\nShe then proceeded to BEG me to please touch her because she just needed someone to make her feel loved and I stood up and almost ran to get Ralph. Ralph just laughed at me when I told him and refused to come with me so I had someone in the room that could help if needed.  So, defeated, I went back in the room to try one more time and when I opened that door, she was moaning and pleasuring herself! She looked at me and said ‚Äúcome help me!‚Äù And I was outta there. \n\nI told Ralph the patient looked like she was in distress and he needed to get in there right away! He ran in there ready for a code and as soon as he walked in, she started screaming for him to help her ‚Äúfinish‚Äù and as I closed the door behind him, I said, ‚Äúhe also loves tattoos so you‚Äôll have to make sure he sees your new one!‚Äù About a minute later I sent a second tech in so he wasn‚Äôt alone, but he informed me later she not only SHOWED him the tat, but offered to let him try the ride for free!\n\nRalph eventually got written up for leaving me alone with her, but to this day, we are friends and it‚Äôs one of our favorite battle stories to tell!",

        "text": " While I was in 4th grade there was a boy in my class who was the well known bully in my grade. He would bully me relentlessly because I was a boy with long hair, which at that age I guess is a big deal for some kids? Anyway, he always used to give me so much trouble all the way from simple name calling all the way to punching me and pushing me into the nettles at recess. One day I was finally pushed over the edge by his antics, after he shamed me in front of the entire class followed by the classic point and laugh of everyone in there.\n\nEnough was enough. I asked to be dismissed for a bathroom break (really so I could calm down outside) which the teacher allowed me to do. However, on the way back from my little walk around the hallways I realized the cloakroom was right there, with all of the backpacks and packed lunches. For some reason I instantly knew what I had to do, I had quite the appetite for destruction, a gut feeling you might say. I made sure no one was around and walked right on in, found his backpack and opened it up. I reached on in there and grabbed his lunchbox, helping myself first of all to the delicious cheese crackers. Lovely. Next up I made sure his apple was polished clean all the way to the core. If I remember rightly it was rather sweet, just like my revenge felt at the time. The sandwiches were up next. Classic peanut butter and jelly. My favorite. I left every single empty packet in his lunchbox along with the apple core, knowing it would be even funnier watching him figure out what happened rather than him thinking maybe his mom forgot to pack his lunch. I closed up his lunchbox and did my best to make it look untouched the way I had found it in his backpack. Anyway, after my little snack break I walked back into class and waited until lunch knowing oh so soon he would get what was coming to him.\n\n**Ring ring.** There was the lunch bell. I knew it was time. What followed I can still remember like it was yesterday. We all went to get out lunchboxes and made our way to the canteen area. I remember sitting down in my seat and biting into my sandwich waiting for him to open his lunch. I was watching from across the room from the outcast table, waiting to see his smug little face drop. Here is was. The moment I had been waiting for all my young school life. Seeing him finally feel even just one iota of the misery he caused me every single day for such a stupid reason. I looked up to see him, gazing at what laid before him; a pile of empty packets of what was once his lunch. The look on his face was priceless. I only wish I could paint the picture of it I have in my mind and hang it on my wall. I finally did it whether he knew it was me or not behind this masterpiece of revenge. There I was now enjoying my own lunch as he had to sit there and watch everyone else enjoying their own lunches too. He told the teachers what had happened, but I was never even a suspect because I was always such a quiet child and barely ever got into any kind of trouble.\n\nI had succeeded. I didn't care if he knew it was me or not. The fact he never knew who did it made it even sweeter. I wanted him to sit there thinking who did this to him, who the traitor in the camp could have been. I know it was such a petty thing to do but I still to this day feel no remorse for what I did. He deserved it. Easily the dumbest yet most satisfying revenge ever. I have no idea how but he actual did stop being such a horrible person. I think the fear of not knowing who had done this to him actually terrified him into not being such a smarmy little bully. No one ever found out that it was me that liberated the grade from his daily torture. I am still proud of what I did, I have no regrets at all. I just wanted to finally tell this story I have never told anyone before.\n\nTL:DR: The well known 4th grade bully at the time finally got a taste (ironically) of his own medicine after I ate his lunch, with no one ever finding out it was me. Leaving him too scared to give anyone a hard time again in case they were the phantom lunch eater.",

        "text": "This happened a few years back when I was working as a camp counselor at a summer day camp. \n\nAs a little back story: the camp I worked at was at a school, and this school was infamous for its number of accidents that occurred as people leave or enter the school driveway. Basically, the driveway starts at a ‚ÄúT‚Äù intersection, where you can only turn right or left to enter the driveway. The only stop sign is at the exit of the school driveway, and as a way to ease traffic backups, the lane that turns right into the driveway has a yield sign. This is because far more people come from the direction that turns left into the school, and if this lane had to yield to the right turners, traffic would be backed up for ages. As you can imagine, dick wads who do not know how to read or drive always blow through the yield when turning right, usually as someone is turning from the left, almost always leading to an accident. \n\nWell, on this particular morning, I am arriving at the school a few minutes before I am supposed to start working, turning left into the driveway as I always do. There is an oncoming car a good distance away, and I pause to see if they will be going straight, in which case I would yield to them. Still a fair distance away, I see them put on their right turn signal. \n\nOk, I‚Äôm good to go. I begin my left turn, at which point, instead of slowing down as they entered the turn, the car sped up and made a point to come as close to me as possible before slamming on their brakes. At the same time, the driver lays on her horn and points at me, clearly yelling some obscenity and going absolutely ballistic. A little surprised, I continue driving, following the speed limit all the way up the long, long driveway. All the while, this lady is riding my ass like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. \n\nI finally get up to the parking lot and park, while the lady pulls in the spot directly next to me. I get out of my car and make my way down to the drop-off spot for the kids, noticing that this woman is the mother of a kid who has a reputation for being an absolute piece of shit (we‚Äôll call him Trash).\n\nWell, give it a few minutes, and Trash comes running down to the drop-off play area, ready to wreak all kinds of havoc. Meanwhile, Trash‚Äôs Mom (TM) walks over to my boss (the day camp director) and starts going off on her while frantically pointing at me repeatedly. After TM leaves, my boss comes over and asks me if it was true that I blew the yield and nearly caused an accident with Trash and his mom and then sped off at nearly 50 mph all the way up the driveway. Shocked, I explained the whole situation to her, emphasizing that I was turning left and she had the yield sign and then she was on my ass as I went 25 mph up the driveway. Placated, my boss simply tells me to ‚Äúbe careful when driving on school grounds‚Äù and walks away.\n\nAt this point, I am FUMING, and I know exactly what needs to be done. For the remaining 7 weeks of camp, I make a point to give Trash as little leeway as possible. It is not unusual for little spats to break out daily between the kids, most of which can be dealt with by simply telling the kids to stop and separating them for a while. However, Trash almost always takes it too far, to the point that it‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúspat‚Äù (most often, biting other kids, which is just never ok) and from then on, any time I notice Trash picking on one of the girls or fighting with one of the other boys, I tell him I will take him to the office (the camp equivalent of going to the principal‚Äôs) if he does it again. \n\nBeing the little piece of walrus feces that he is, Trash continues to act up throughout the summer, prompting the other counselors and myself to take him to the office multiple times. By the third time, he was getting phone calls home and would break out in tears as soon as he realized he was going to the office.\n\nKeep in mind, the counselors do not enjoy taking kids to the office and making them cry, which is why we normally handle it within ourselves and give the kids a break. However, everything Trash is doing is legitimate enough to warrant a trip to the office (hitting, biting, kicking, saying cuss words, etc.); he is simply unfortunate enough to have a shitty parent who cut my patience short and eliminated any little bit of leeway Trash may have had. \n\nAs the cherry on top, I regularly put Trash in groups with other kids who he didn‚Äôt like and who didn‚Äôt like him for group activities like bowling, outside time, arts and crafts, etc. This just made it so he was never able to have fun, or gang up on other campers with his friends, in these otherwise enjoyable activities.\n\nI stopped working at the camp after that summer, so I have no clue if Trash ever came back in the following summers, but I‚Äôm glad I had the chance to get some petty revenge on a shitty person and her shitty son while I worked there. \n\nEdit: My boss wholeheartedly supported the counselors‚Äô decision to separate the boy from his friends during various activities, as he caused way more trouble when he was with his friends. \n\nKeep in mind, this kid did not suddenly start getting in trouble just because I had a grudge against his mom. He had gotten in trouble many times before, as he was a perpetual bully and for some reason really enjoyed biting people. I simply started warning him that if he continued acting up, he would go to the office and have more serious consequences. Lo and behold, he continued acting up and experienced said consequences. The other counselors and I never thought of it as ‚Äúsingling him out‚Äù because he was by far the worst-behaved kid at the camp. I simply had the pleasure of taking the kid to the office a few times and then watching as his mom came to get him, completely exasperated. \n\nFinally, as was suggested in a comment, this boy had absolutely no signs of physical abuse at home. We went to the pool every day, and this kid never had any bruises. And if you‚Äôre thinking he had neglectful parents and an emotionally abusive home situation, there were no signs of this either. He was given large, complete lunches by his parents every day, always came in with money to buy pizza on Fridays and snacks when we went bowling or skating, and always received huge hugs and a kiss on the cheek from his mom when she dropped him off in the morning. The directors of the camp and the medical staff received professional training to find signs of abuse at home, and this kid did not meet the criteria of showing anything remotely related to home abuse. As far as we were concerned, he was just poorly raised and was brought up to not expect consequences for his actions.",

After looking in the seats and under the table (mind you we are crazy at this point and this is just killing my to do list in my head) I told him we don‚Äôt have it and I‚Äôd trust my bussers with my life‚Äôs savings so I know they don‚Äôt take it. We have cameras so I told him to leave his name and a number we can reach him and after the rush I‚Äôd check them to see who took it. Kept yelling about us being thieves as he left which was embarrassing to us even though we are good people. Fast forward about 30 minutes and low and behold, his phone turns up. Another guest had found it on the tp dispenser in one of the men‚Äôs stalls. Now I‚Äôm pissed. I take the phone and thought of just chucking it into the parking lot but I figured I‚Äôd just be the bigger guy and get my revenge when he came back to get it. As I‚Äôm putting it under the register, I realize this old fart doesn‚Äôt have a lock on it. I don‚Äôt know why it came to me but it was so instant I cracked a smile without thinking. I went into his settings and changed the language to Chinese and put a lock with the code being 3425 ( DICK). Can‚Äôt wait till he comes and gets it.",

This one day I get called to take some flat-pack out to a customer car and the box is about 3m long, 1m wide and says on it \"87kg 2-person lift minimum\" so obviously I was struggling just to get it off the high storage shelf it was on (in hindsight: i'm glad I didn't break my back or anything else as I was standing on a ladder trying to shift this on my own) so I asked one of the girls at the register to come help, turns out he was watching me struggle and as soon as I asked for help he come rushing over to shout me down in front of the customer, then apologised to the girl for my actions while glaring at me, (to be clear; we all worked for the same man and even though they were on registers they did not have it easy, he was extremely creepy, I got along with all the girls at that place and held no animosity towards them for the position they were in).\n\nSo I quit on the spot, told him to go fuck himself, walked out, called my friend and went to the beach.\n\n  \nWhen I was done swimming I had about 3 missed called and a bunch of messages starting with asking me to come back - then calling me a little shit and stating I had to bring my uniforms back or I wasn't getting my final paycheck so my friend and I went for another swim, then used the work shirts that were in my car as towels, as well as dipping them in the salt water for good measure, then went to my friends place, hung out for a few hours while these soaking wet shirts sat in an extremely hot car, when I left my friends place the whole car reeked of salt water, so I thought to myself I should return my uniforms, walked in to his office with them and dropped them on 4 separate piles of paperwork, and said \"Hey, here's the uniforms, looking forward to my final paycheck, and i've saved those voicemails so expect a call sometime soon about those\".\n\nTL;DR; My boss was a complete asshole, abused me when I quit and threatened to withhold pay if I didn't bring my uniforms in, he received a pile of disgusting, soaking wet shirts, that had been sitting in a hot car for 2 hours that ruined about a month's worth of paperwork on his desk.  \n",

        "text": "A couple months ago I walked into a convenience store, followed by four 10-12 year olds right behind me. Immediately, I could tell they were up to something. One of the kids very loudly said, ‚Äúok so Im just going to look around a bit while I wait for my mom.‚Äù It was like he was announcing it for the benefit of the cashier. They were all trying way too hard to ‚Äúact normally‚Äù when it really just made them stand out that much more.  They broke off separately and walked down different aisles. Then, plain as day, I see a them open up their backpacks and not so sneakily, slip items into their bags.  I quietly told the cashier that the kids were stealing. I kept quiet and waited until they dug their holes a little deeper. Two of the kids walked up to check-out, each with only one small item. The other two hung back a little further. \n\nOh thieving adolescents, you are not sly. I suppose I could have just told the cashier and left it at that, but where‚Äôs the fun in that? I couldn‚Äôt just pass up an opportunity to publicly shame a group of pre-teens, could I? Nope. So I called them out and asked if they had forgotten about the items they had stuffed into their backpacks. \n\nDeer in headlights. All of them. The responses of, ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù ‚ÄúUhh, umm? I put the other stuff back.‚Äù  \n\nMe: ‚ÄúSee, we all know that‚Äôs not true now is it?‚Äù It took roughly 1 minute for these kids to fold. Once they accepted defeat and realized they‚Äôd been caught, I walked with them and helped them put back all of their stolen items, all the while shitting their pants. \n\nOne kid bolted out of the store as soon as I called them out. One kid began crying and the other 2 just begged to not be in trouble and not to call the police or their parents. At that point, the cashier took over and made it very clear they were never allowed back into the store.  \n\nSorry, Not sorry kids. Don‚Äôt steal. \n\nEdit: For clarity, the items were things like chips, 5 hour energy, and candy. They all appeared to be well taken care of as they all had nice clothes, shoes, backpacks, hats, sunglasses, etc. \n\nSeveral people brought up whether or not this would actually be considered revenge. The boys did not steal from me personally, that‚Äôs true. I do live in the community and I witnessed a business being ripped off.  That is someone‚Äôs livelihood. Shouldn‚Äôt we have our neighbors backs? I don‚Äôt think revenge is concretely specific to oneself, and can be had on another‚Äôs behalf. \n\nYes, I intentionally brought attention to what they were doing.  The goal was to  scare or embarrass them and hopefully deter them from doing it again.  I would really hope someone would do the exact same thing to my son if he were pulling some crap like that.  ",

        "text": "Sorry if the story seems a bit long, TL;DR at the bottom!\n\nOkay, to start, this isn‚Äôt my story but my friend‚Äôs, but it was just so brilliantly petty I had to post it here (with permission). So my friend‚Äîwe‚Äôll call him Edward‚Äîworks at a hospital on the front desk. More specifically, he works the night shift at the front desk, filling out online forms and registering people into the hospital. And the thing about the night shift at a hospital according to Edward is, well, most of the people that go there late at night are either really really sick or injured, or otherwise completely fine. There is no in between.\n\nSo Edward is working his shift as usual, and unfortunately is having a pretty bad night. People yelling at him, giving confusing/nonsensical details for the registration forms, things of that nature. He even almost lost it because a lady individually told him‚Äînot asked, told‚Äîto fill out registration forms for her and her two children... every time he finished filling one out instead of just telling him to do so for all of them from the start. Like I said, it was a bad night.\n\nNow here‚Äôs where it gets fun.\n\nNear the end of the night, some lady comes into the hospital, and right off the bat Edward can tell she‚Äôs homeless. So, we‚Äôll call her MHL, for Manipulative Homeless Lady.\n\nMHL: ‚ÄúUh, hello? I‚Äôd like to register. I‚Äôve been having some really bad back pain recently.‚Äù\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúAlright, sure. What‚Äôs your name and address?‚Äù\n\nMHL: ‚ÄúMy name is MHL.‚Äù\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúUh-huh. And your address?‚Äù\n\nAnd at this point, HML suddenly becomes rather... difficult to get an answer from. Not that she was being aggressive or anything, but she wouldn‚Äôt give a straight answer for a bit, saying how she was ‚Äúbetween homes‚Äù, or something of the like. Which, of course, my friend found to be a ridiculous statement, but whatever.\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúAre you homeless?‚Äù\n\nMHL: ‚ÄúWell, technically yes but-‚Äú\n\nAlright, good enough. Edward fills out the form from there, and her hospital visit begins. She‚Äôs taken to a doctor, the doctor looks her over, but finds no notable issues that can be seen with her, only recommending that she stay a bit for observation. About half an hour at the most which, to be honest, Edward was pretty sure was just the doctor being nice so she doesn‚Äôt have to stay outside in the night for as long as she may have to if he just turned her away immediately.\n\nBefore she actually heads to the doctor, however, there was this period of time in which Edward is stuck with the lady because the doctor is momentarily unavailable and the two are able to converse. Edward learns from MHL that apparently she‚Äôs recently gotten a new job, lined up for around next week, and she‚Äôs hoping that she can turn her luck around with it.\n\nEdward, being an overall sappy guy with an overall optimistic perspective on life, albeit less so after the night he‚Äôs had, naturally starts to feel sorry for the lady, warming up to her. She wasn‚Äôt mean, after all, and she seemed to have a good head on her shoulders. Or so he thought.\n\nTime passes and, eventually, Edward is asked to go get the lady from her thirty minutes of rest so she can leave. After all, this is a hospital, and they‚Äôre expected to be prepared to treat people who are, to put it bluntly, actually sick.\n\nSo he walks in to her room and, wouldn‚Äôt you know it, MHL is essentially asleep to the point of being comatose, blankets over her, lights turned off, the whole shebang.\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam. It‚Äôs time for you to get going, we need this room cleared for cleaning and other possible patients.‚Äù\n\nMHL: ‚ÄúHm? Oh sure, sorry, no problem. Just give me five minutes.‚Äù\n\nFive minutes pass. Edward comes back.\n\nAnd once more, she is completely comatose, tucked in and everything. Suffice to say Edward is starting to feel a few red flags raising at this point.\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôve given you five minutes. Again, we really do need this room available for cleaning, as well as future patients.‚Äù\n\nMHL: ‚ÄúHm? Oh, right, sorry. I‚Äôll be right out.‚Äù\n\nRepeat this about two more times before Edward finally decides ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and tells her to either get out or he‚Äôll get security. In as kind and polite a way as he could.\n\nWhich I imagine to have been very difficult...\n\nAnyhow, the lady is out of the room, but she asks if someone could call a cab for her. So be it.\n\nThey call a cab, and surprisingly a bit of mini petty revenge happens here as the cab driver that shows up ends up being the same driver that Edward always ends up getting at this hour, some asshole stereotypical taxi driver named ‚ÄúRajesh‚Äù‚Äîfake name, but it really is that stereotypical‚Äîwho cares more about money than the customers he deals with.\n\nWhatever, Edward figures, I have my beef with this guy, but I‚Äôm not the one paying the cab... turns out neither is MHL, because she has no money and decided not to mention it to anyone as they called a cab. Apparently she expected them to pay?\n\nAnd guess who has the brilliant responsibility of having to inform the driver that nobody is paying for the cab after all?\n\nFive internet points if you figured it out, negative three hundred otherwise. But c‚Äômon, who here actually keeps track of those?\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúSo, yeah, sorry but it turns out that we can‚Äôt pay for the cab. The lady who we called it for has no money, as it turns out, and we aren‚Äôt allowed to pay for another patient‚Äôs fare from personal accounts because-‚Äú\n\nRajesh: ‚ÄúARE YOU KIDDING ME? FUCK YOU AND FUCK THIS HOSPITAL. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CUSTOMERS I MAY HAVE LOST JUST DRIVING HERE? DO YOU KNOW, FUCK ASS, HOW MANY IM LOSING JUST HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE LIKES OF YOU?‚Äù\n\nHaving had a very rough night up until this point, this was supposedly one of those ‚Äústraw that broke the camel‚Äôs back moments for Edward‚Äù as he proceeded to curse out the driver, pretty much daring him to come back to the hospital ever again or come out of the car‚Äîand while he isn‚Äôt exactly an intimidating guy himself, he definitely knows how to fight, and probably could have laid Rajesh out right then and there‚Äîbefore Rajesh basically burns rubbed out of there back onto the streets.\n\nSo that mini petty revenge being over, we return to the normal one as Edward goes back in to deal with MHL.\n\nHe asks her if she knows any bus routes she can take back to wherever she ‚Äústays‚Äù, and offers to help take her there.\n\nBefore she could answer, one of his coworkers, a 50 years old or so security guard whom Edward described as being one of the nicest older men he knew, offers the lady about two bucks to cover the bus. The lady says thanks and that she‚Äôll head towards the bus herself.\n\nShe takes it, and Edward figured it‚Äôs over and done with.\n\nShifts start to change and Edward starts getting ready to leave, packing his shit and leaving when he takes notice of something. Despite the fact that it‚Äôs been a while since the lady supposedly stated she would be heading to the bus, she‚Äôs still in the front desk waiting room.\n\nAnd at this point, Edward knows exactly what‚Äôs going on.\n\nHe had a few red flags raise before, but having dealt with it before, he was absolutely sure now that this lady had no intention of leaving. She was more likely to wait until a new person took his place at the front desk so she could hopefully stay the whole night.\n\nEssentially, she was lying about her condition so she could have a bed to sleep in, something which Edward informed me that unfortunately happens quite a bit.\n\nAnd while I and he have no issue with helping people, there‚Äôs something that ticks him off about people that lie their way to people‚Äôs good graces to take advantage of their good nature.\n\nAt this point, another co-worker of his walks in and asks him what‚Äôs up. He explains the situation, watching from out of the lady‚Äôs sight.\n\nHis coworker decides to watch, getting a kick out of the whole story, and soon enough the lady that takes Edwards place on the front desk sits down. And before you could even say ‚Äúfucking called it‚Äù, MHL immediately walks towards her and tries to register.\n\nMHL: ‚ÄúUm, excuse me, I would like to register myself here.‚Äù\n\nFront Desk Lady: ‚ÄúNo problem. What‚Äôs your name and address, and what might be the issue?‚Äù\n\nAnd as it turns out, Edward had had it easy when she had just told him that she was experiencing back pains, because she started to come up with the mother of all lies.\n\nWe‚Äôre talking the humidity of coming from California to Florida fucking up her brain, stress causing one of her disks to somehow slip, how she was referred to here by another hospital so she could rest here for observation for a night, and even a fucking car accident.\n\nAnd Edward, and his coworker, are just standing around a corner hearing this, both laughing and raging at the stupidity of what she was saying, and the apparent fact that she had believed everyone at the hospital to be stupid as well. I mean, HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET IN A CAR ACCIDENT?\n\nIf you‚Äôre homeless, why should he believe you have a car? Especially if you literally just asked for a cab that you can‚Äôt pay for and had to take someone‚Äôs money for a bus.\n\nEdward apparently found said point to be so ridiculous enough that he had to chime in. From around the corner, he proceeded to ask her about the car accident, hoping she wouldn‚Äôt remember his voice despite the fact that they had literally had a one on one conversation not too long ago. Sure enough, she doesn‚Äôt.\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs terrible, how did that car accident happen?‚Äù\n\nShe proceeded to go into this long, clearly made up story about how it was technically her fault, but it also wasn‚Äôt, and how apparently this guy had turned a corner to fast and slightly hit her with his car hole she was walking across the street. Okay, so no car, but a car to pedestrian impact that didn‚Äôt end up with her having any particularly major, or even minor injuries, whatsoever. That happened more recently. Sure.\n\nNow at this point, Edward is just done with her, and before he could figure out what to do to deal with her, he remembers the two bucks that she was given by that security guard, whom had himself finished his shift a few minutes ago, and figured that MHL was sure as shit not gonna con either him, the hospital, or his coworkers out of anything. Even two goddamn bucks.\n\nSo he proceeds to walk up to her and, in the calmest voice possible, gains her attention.\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that ma‚Äôam. Though, to be honest, the doctor‚Äôs would probably have been able to help you better had you informed me of some of these other conditions of yours when I had registered you earlier.‚Äù\n\nAnd the look on her face when she realized that the guy she had registered herself under apparently hadn‚Äôt left yet and that she had been caught in her lie was one that could fill the heavens with bliss and joy enough so that even the great Buddha would happily shove a giant middle finger into the earth upon which MHL stood.\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúThough, I have to ask, if you aren‚Äôt planning on using that bus fare my friend gave you, would you mind giving it back? I‚Äôll be sure to tell him that you were fine and hadn‚Äôt needed it.‚Äù\n\nMHL, whom is very clearly shitting enough bricks to rebuild London Bridge: ‚ÄúOh, um, of course. Sure.‚Äù\n\nEdward ended up getting those two bucks back‚Äîhe returned them to the security guard next time he saw them‚Äîand proceeded to cause a homeless lady that had thought of him and his fellow staff as stupid to have enough egg on her face to have Gordon Ramsey have a Hemorrhaghic Stroke. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, shortly after this was over, after the lady had once again registered‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt really do anything to stop her according to hospital policy, though he‚Äôs told she did not stay long after‚Äîhe had a short conversation with the front desk lady who had replaced him.\n\nFront Desk Lady: ‚ÄúRough night, huh?‚Äù\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúA crap ton of bad luck more like it.‚Äù\n\nFront Desk Lady: ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt be so superstitious.‚Äù\n\nEdward: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I mean, you never know when bad luck could be right around the corner!‚Äù\n\nHe yelled this last part. Just loud enough so he could be sure the homeless lady waiting in the room just around the corner could hear him.\n\nTL;DR: Homeless lady tries to trick hospital staff into letting her stay the night by telling her she‚Äôs got back problems (she doesn‚Äôt), friend proceeds to not only expose and embarrass the hell out of her‚Äîcausing her to leave shortly after‚Äîbut also take back the bus fare his coworker had gifted her for the bus she wasn‚Äôt planning on using.",

        "text": "Tl/dr at bottom.\n\nJust this evening I was taking my dog on a walk. She‚Äôs a good old girl but was getting antsy after being stuck inside from the heat. She knows to take every opportunity to poop because we don‚Äôt have a backyard so she plops a massive turd on the grass and being a responsible pet owner, I bag the big mushy turd to throw away when I pass a dumpster.\n\nWe got to a semi busy four lane road, there‚Äôs enough cars and they are going fast enough that I wait at the crosswalk before going across. One car stops, nice, we start to cross. \n\nNext lane in, I can tell the driver isn‚Äôt slowing down. If I keep walking in the crosswalk he will hit me and my dog. Don‚Äôt put my dog in danger, it made me pretty mad.\n\nI stop, because I‚Äôm not stupid, and toss up the big ripe bag of dog poopy. The car comes within two feet of me (and my dog stuck close to my hip) still going 35 mph (speed limit on that road) and the bag explodes over the windshield.  \n\nBackground on me. I‚Äôm a 330 lb 6ft bearded man. A lot of that weight is in my tummy, but I wear a size 58 jacket in the shoulders so I‚Äôm thick as a grand piano and can square up when I want to (I‚Äôm actually pretty nice, I work with disabled kids professionally and dealing with people bullying my clients is the only other time I get scary)\n\nDriver slams on their brakes with a big brown puddle over their windshield, I flip double birds and look pissed, driver pulls out again and drives on. We walk home and I give good doggie a treat because it seriously scared me that some idiot could have killed her because they weren‚Äôt careful.\n\nTl/dr driver almost hits me and my dog in middle of crosswalk, I throw a bag of dog poop on their windshield on their way past.",

        "text": "I dated this guy, we‚Äôll call him Bear, for about a year. At some point he told me he‚Äôs had a serious mental illness for decades, but was diagnosed only 8 years ago and now takes medication to manage it. I was utterly amazed and impressed by how much he managed to accomplish in his life without it. \n\nHalfway through our relationship I was in a horrible accident and broke my back in several places. I had to have surgery and basically not do anything for 4 straight months. It was awful, but Bear was great about driving me to follow up appointments and to the pharmacy once a week. And every now and then he‚Äôd come keep me company. As I got better and was able to drive, I was grateful to get out of the house, so a few days a week I would go meet Bear places he wanted to go to. \n\nSlowly, I started to see patterns in his routine and he became extremely strict about what he would and wouldn‚Äôt do and where he would or wouldn‚Äôt go. (He started refusing to come to my house because he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be inside a house during the day‚Äù....wait, what?) He attributed this to the risk of breakthrough symptoms and he didn‚Äôt want to upset the balance he‚Äôs created in his life. \n\nI was happy for Bear that he‚Äôd found an effective way to manage his illness and could now work part time (under the table while also collecting disability checks) but Bear was not the one for me. I decided to break it off. I spent a month trying to figure out how to do so without causing undue stress. So I decided to tell him I needed a little space and some time to myself. \n\nA week later I gathered up what I could find of Bear‚Äôs things at my house and headed to the coffee shop he was everyday at that time to hopefully complete the transaction without too much trouble. Bear is angry I‚Äôm there and acting confused as to why. Bear tells me he broke up with me a week ago. No he didn‚Äôt, but that was easy. I take the win and get up and leave. \n\nA week or so later I realized Bear still has my (expensive) spare car key, so I head to the cigar lounge he‚Äôs at every afternoon. I used to go there with him so I know all the other gentleman that were there at the time. I was pleasant and polite when I walked in and sat down and said hi to everyone else there and simply mentioned I was just here to grab my key out of his car, but Bear wasn‚Äôt having it. He was IRATE that I showed up at the place I‚Äôd knew he‚Äôd be. He starts shouting and insulting me and asked if I‚Äôd ever heard of a phone and he would have sent it to me in the mail. \n\nUmm, no thank you. Based on the last interaction, there‚Äôs no f*cking way in god damned Hades I would ever leave it up to him to get it back to me. So, Bear shoves the key at me, climbs in his truck, slams his car door and tears off down the street. Later that day I laughed to find he‚Äôs blocked me on every social platform possible and I‚Äôve never been blocked by anyone ever because I‚ÄôM A GENUINELY NICE PERSON. \n\nNeedless to say I‚Äôve not talked to or seen Bear since, so when I found his spare key in my car today, I threw it in the trash and it felt glorious. After all, how am I supposed to tell him I found it. \n\n\n",
