        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/zqffcc/how_was_the_language_shift_from_manchu_to/",
        "text": "This topic is very strange to me because many of the Qing emperors went to great lengths to ensure that Manchu would survive in the court and administration, and expended a lot of effort to ensure that Manchu would gain prestige in Chinese society. For example the Qing emperors required bureaucratic officials to sit examinations in Manchu and held court shamanic rituals conducted in the language. And yet through the course of the dynasty, more and more Manchu people switched their vernacular language to Mandarin, so much so that the last Qing emperor Puyi knew only one word in the language, in spite of years of Manchu instruction. By this time Manchu had for the most part ceased to be a spoken language among the rural population as well, even in the historical homeland of the Manchu people.\n\nIn the history of linguistics, this phenomenon seems a bit anomalous to me. Normally when a country is subjugated by a foreign power, they gradually adopt the language of their colonizers, or at least find their native language receiving a subordinate social status to that of their colonizers. A salient example of this is the conquest of Egypt under the Rashidun Caliphate, where the population eventually shifted almost entirely from Coptic to Arabic, with Coptic now being retained only in a liturgical context.\n\nSo this raises the question for me, is language shift necessarily a response to one language holding prestige over another?",

For example, the words sans, cent and sang are all ponounced the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing with the latin words ancestors to those above, sine, centum and sanguis, where all letters were pronounced, this just seems absurd. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as I know, french has dealt with homophones by having them in separate grammatical categories, like un cerf and une serre. Another thing it does is it adds sounds to make two words distinct, like il fait and un fait, where the last one has the t pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at some point it's just gonna reach a point where french will not be able to do that anymore, for now it seems to be using the borrowing strategy, mainly from english and arabic, and also some metathesis called \"verlan\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the end the only way for french to stay understandeable is to review its entire structure. Phonology might see the advent of tones, something that has already begun in swedish and japanese, other languages facing similar problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might also start using inflection, although in order to do that it needs to go through a postposition phase which hasn't yet started. Unless the \"familiar\" use of \"pas\" only is seen as a step towards postpositions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I believe a system of vowel harmony, coupled with the potential postposition stage, could be a factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, I believe french is a very weird language due to its very fast evolution but also an interesting one as it could provide some evidence into the evolution of new phonological and grammatical structures in language.

I don't think it was just inattention-- the list sounded fine to me on several read-throughs before I noticed the problem.\n\nMy guess is that dropping he/she pronouns is more \"comfortable\" because they are less \"marked\" as far as singular pronoun usage goes? Also the \"only talks to peers\"-style option is already gender-neutral as there is no pronoun used at all, so I guess it didn't stand out as needing adjustment. \n\nWhat's my brain doing here? \n\nWhat would you do as far as gender-neutralizing the form? I'll probably just convert the fragments to complete sentences, but I want the form to be as quick and simple for teachers to scan and respond to as possible because they're already overworked and it's already a crapshoot as to whether they'll respond.\n\n(It may be worth noting that I'm neurodivergent so I'm not sure if that is playing a role with what does/doesn't sound right to my ear)",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

        "text": "I am in the process of designing tattoo around *Valkyrie Profile*, one of my favorite video games. In it, sorcerers will recite incantations before casting their most powerful spells. The spells are written in Early Modern English. I plan to get some of these incantations as tattoos, but there is this one that I’m having particular trouble with. It goes like this:\n\n*Ye of detestable name and virtue — false apostle, thou art (bade/bayed) back to the abyss!*\n\nSources use either word, with different explanations for each. Some write *bade*, using it as the past participle of *bid*, with the meaning “to command, order”. However, I only see *bidden* listed as the past participle of that word when I look it up, with *bade* being the preterite form. Because of this inconsistency, some sources list *bayed*, the past participle of *bay*, with the meaning “to chase away (like a pack of hounds)”.\n\nSemantically speaking, *bade* is more natural. But there’s the issue of grammar. It’s very possible the translators and writers made a mistake, or they knew it was wrong and chose it because it sounded better to them. Or they did mean *bayed*, which would be a highly specific but still semantically valid word choice.\n\nHere is a link where you can hear the characters say it (skip to 16:00 for the clearest one): https://youtube.com/watch?v=vQ_ozSYCRDc&amp;feature=shares\n\nIn lieu of finding an official script, I have to make a choice. Personally, I do like *bade* better. Is there a historic precedent from the time of Early Modern English where the preterite was conflated with the past participle in strong verbs? I know in Modern English, verbs like *swim/swam/swum* are losing the past participle form. In *drink/drank/drunk*, the *drunk* form has become so specialized that many people only use it as a modifier. Or given the context, is *bayed* the better choice?\n\nThat was a lot, but I’d appreciate your thoughts. Tattoos are a commitment, and I want to make the right one! Thank you much.",

        "text": "Hey again!\n\nLast week you liked my idea to post puzzles here, so I'm happy to oblige. Here's a fresh one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(by A.Pipersky)\n\nIn 1970s, Malayalam writing system was adapted for easier use on typewriters.\n\nThe picture presents 7 syllables in Malayalam. Four of the Malayalam characters are given in both the new and the old script.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccx12om3g86a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb6f87ce38991b1c48de24f94a71154594aff464\n\nTheir readings in random order are as follows: kʰa, kʰra, ṭru, dā, du, pra, mā\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Find the correct reading for each character\n2. Determine which characters are given in the old and which are in the new style\n3. Transcribe the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfr5xdqzf86a1.png?width=133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00a2dfd8cefd464b5fcaa971d6af072a2ee74a1\n\nHave fun!  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nShort answer&gt;!:!&lt;\n\n&gt;!1) dā (n.s.), 2) kʰa (both styles), 3) kʰra (new style), 4) ṭru (n.s.), 5) mā (n.s.), 6) pra (old style)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!7) ṭru (o.s.), 8) du (o.s.), 9) pra (n.s.), 10) kʰra (o.s.), 11) du (n.s.)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2. The last two syllables are ṭa, and drā!&lt;\n\nMy thinking was:\n\n1. &gt;!Find the four old/new pairs. These are ##4:7, 8:11, 3:10, and 6:9. (I numbered them as they appear in the first picture.) Note that half of them consists of separate elements, while in the other half the elements are all connected. The remaining three characters also use separate elements, and this is probably the new style, since assigning typewriter keys to different elements rather than whole symbols would require a smaller number of keys.!&lt;\n2. &gt;!Group similar consonants and vowels  (3 a's, 2 each of ā's, u's, kʰ's, d's, and r-after-another-consonant). The single sound that is not repeated is m; the only non-repeated symbol is the first half of #5, i.e. #5 is mā =&gt; second part of this symbol reads ā =&gt; #1 is dā =&gt; the first half of #1 is d =&gt; 8:11 is du =&gt; the last element in #8 is u =&gt; #4:7 is ṭru =&gt; the first element in #4:7 is r-after-consonant.!&lt;\n3. &gt;!Which means we have kʰra and pra for the remaining two pairs of old/new style ##3:10 and 6:9, respectively), since the middle element in them is not the same and since the middle element in #3:10 is the same as in #2, making #2 = kʰa.!&lt;\n4. &gt;!With the last two symbols my thinking was a bit off. As stated in the short answer, they read  read ṭa and drā. I assumed that the upward \"stick\" at the ends of ##3:10, 6:9, and 2 read /a/. But we have a syllabic system, meaning that a character cannot read /t/ and meaning that -a is the default vowel, since we do have syllables ending with -a but see no special symbol for it.!&lt;",

        "author": "quercus_opuntia",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/zn53vd/how_would_global_communication_change_if_all/",
        "text": "Sorry if this topic has already been discussed here but I’ve been thinking about it for some time and it’s super interesting to me. As linguists I’m sure you’re all saddened by the tragedy that is language loss/extinction, but I’m curious as to how the tradeoffs between language diversity and global communication interact.\n\nTo begin it would of course be useful to define what exactly I mean by all languages being “restored” to their traditional ranges. Of course I have to make a judgment call here that is rather arbitrary, but the easiest choice here in my mind is their ranges in the pre-imperialist age before assimilation destroyed tons of languages.\n\nAgain, this approach of course raises issues; even before the imperialist age (whenever one would define that as), different ethnic groups fought over land and resources, and those groups (and the languages they were associated with) undoubtedly were changed, assimilated, or otherwise lost. Language changes constantly so the idea of a “pure” form of a language or a world where every language has been perfectly preserved is irrational.\n\nHowever, if we just sort of assume that we go to an alternate timeline where the world was more peaceful and imperialism never happened, and all languages/ethnic groups/cultures were able to prosper and be independent on their own, how would that change things?\n\nOf course the effects wouldn’t just be relevant to linguistics; the newer array of vast cultures, ethnicities, etc that will have not been absorbed into others would change virtually every aspect of life. But with the fact that there will be MANY more languages in circulation (or at least, most languages with very few speakers right now would see their number of speakers increase dramatically), how would global communication even function?\n\nFrom what sources I’ve found, there are around 7,000 languages currently. Around 500 languages have also gone extinct - assuming 7,500 languages now, that is a staggering amount.\n\nOf course, not all would have the same amount of speakers; I would imagine more historically isolated languages on remote islands or in inhospitable places (very far north) would have fewer speakers simply due to a lower population of people living in those areas.\n\nBut just taking North America for example; English dominates the region, Spanish of course is the primary language in Mexico with a sizable minority in the US, and French maintains a (relatively) geographically small yet strong presence in Quebec. Of course other languages are present, but none to an overall relevant degree. That’s 3 languages for 500 million people, and even then the languages have strict ties with countries/geographic areas. Outside of Mexico and Quebec, English is the de facto language.\n\nReplacing those 3 languages with the hundreds of indigenous Native American languages, how would communication then function across the continent? It would no longer be trivial for people on the opposite sides of the US to communicate with each other.\n\nIs the solution to have everyone learn some second language that they can all collectively use to communicate, kind of similar to how English is dominating the current global landscape? If that is the case, then which language is chosen - how on earth would that be fairly decided? If in trying to escape that problem, an artificial language was constructed, how would this new language even be structured? How could one make a language that is about as easy to learn for native speakers of every language to try and make everything as fair as possible?\n\nAdditionally, even if some “perfect” language is created or chosen, then more problems arise. Would it have to be standardized in some way to prevent it from inevitably changing in different areas that it’s introduced to prevent it from eventually splitting into even more languages, and how would that even be done? From what I’ve heard, it seems the general linguistic consensus is that languages changing and branching off is pretty much unstoppable.\n\nLastly, keeping with the theme of preserving language and culture, even if all languages were “preserved”, how could one continue to best preserve them in a global era without completely isolating them? First of all, being exposed to worldwide cultures and languages would undoubtedly mean being exposed to many new concepts, meaning new words would need to be invented; how would loan words be incorporated? Would languages simply adapt a loose phonetic representation of them or try to derive their own words that represent the concept?\n\nAdditionally, with one language dominating, wouldn’t there be a cultural tendency to sort of “look up” to that language and take after it? The example I would use for this would be Japanese which historically was heavily influenced by the Chinese language as it seemed like the more dominant, “cooler” language; and this same process is happening now but with English, as a huge amount of English loanwords are being adopted into Japanese and being used, especially by the youth. It seems that English’s position as an increasingly dominant global language means it will continue to influence other languages as speaking English will make one seem more educated, etc… Meaning that having one central language would have huge effects on all other languages.\n\nOf course there are other solutions; there could, for example, be maybe several dozen languages that dominate as lingua francas for their respective regions. Closer geographic areas are likely to have more linguistic, cultural, and ethnic similarities, helping mitigate the aforementioned problems. But then again, while this helps a lot with shorter communication, there would still be a want/need to communicate globally. Would a lingua franca necessarily emerge/dominate in time? How many languages would one need to know to communicate? Would languages eventually end up going extinct out of sheer lack of convenience, and how could that process be fought?\n\nI know this was a long post but I hope this can foster some good discussion. I’m sure there are many insights/avenues of thought relevant to this problem that I have missed so I’m curious as to what y’alls thoughts are. Especially as an American, I’m sure insights from people who live in much more linguistically diverse areas are better than mine.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/zmu8ip/alternative_analysis_for_english_vowel_diaphonemes/",
        "text": "It has always bugged me a bit that English vowel phonemes are traditionally analyzed with such an asymmetrical system, whereas many other languages have simple, symmetric vowel systems. Since phonemes are just abstract representations, why not give them symmetrical symbols instead? Here is a system I propose:\n\n|**Symmetrical Symbol**|**Traditional Symbol**|**Example Word**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|/a/|/æ/|bat|\n|/a:/|/ɑ:/|spa|\n|/ɒ/|/ɒ/|dot|\n|/ɒ:/|/ɔ:/|fraud|\n|/e/|/ɛ/|bet|\n|/e:/|/eɪ/|date|\n|/o/|/ʌ/|but|\n|/o:/|/oʊ/|boat|\n|/i/|/ɪ/|bit|\n|/i:/|/i:/|beat|\n|/u/|/ʊ/|put|\n|/u:/|/u:/|boot|\n|/ə/|/ə/|pand**a**|\n|/ə:/|/ɜ:/|bird|\n|/ai/|/aɪ/|bite|\n|/au/|/aʊ/|loud|\n|/oi/|/ɔɪ/|void|\n\nThis system is obviously much more symmetrical and similar to the vowel phoneme systems of several other European languages, ex. Czech, Hungarian, and Norwegian, which all have neat pairs of short and long consonants (according to Wikipedia). It doesn't necessarily mean they are realized as identical vowels only differing in length in those languages, just that the short-long pair notation is simpler, and so I thought this model would naturally be a suitable phonemic system for English too.\n\nUsing Wikipedia's diaphonemic English IPA transcription standard as a starting point, I noticed that it has 7 short vowels and 5 long vowels. However, since traditional /eɪ/ and /oʊ/ often behave like monophthongs in American English, I decided to analyze them as phonemic monophthongs to facilitate short-long pairing. So the symmetric system can be concisely presented as follows:\n\n||**Front**|**Central**|**Back**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Close**|i i:||u u:|\n|**Mid**|e e:|ə ə:|o o:|\n|**Open**|a a:||ɒ ɒ:|\n\nPlus 3 phonemic diphthongs: /ai/, /au/, /oi/.\n\nPlease let me know if this is a suitable phonemic representation for English vowels. I am also curious why this type of symmetric system is not the norm for English vowels, but it is the norm for many other languages. I also have some other reanalysis-of-phonemic-system ideas for other languages that I will share in the future, but I would love some feedback on this system for now. Thanks!",

        "text": "As a native Hindi speaker, this is something that has always bugged me since I first visited my village about 100 kms from New Delhi, in what many would consider the heart of the \"Hindi belt\".\n\nThe people there spoke a language I barely understood, and by that I mean I can understand the same amount of Punjabi, which is considered a separate language, as I could understand the language they spoke in my village.\n\nSimple things like \"have you eaten food?\" or \"when did you get here?\" I could somewhat understand, but it was impossible to actually hold a conversation with the locals.\n\nOver time I learnt that the language they speak is called \"Braj\", which along with Khariboli, Awadhi and numerous other languages spoken in different parts of North India, is considered a Hindi dialect. \n\nThis was just an interesting fact to me until I recently visited my village and found that practically no one under the age of 30 still spoke Braj - having had to move to nearby bigger cities for education and work, these people all spoke the same Hindi which is spoken in Delhi and Bombay albeit with a distinct accent. The people who spoke Braj and were hard for me to communicate with were no longer in the majority. \n\nContrasting this with Punjabi or Bhojpuri, both of which are equally similar to Hindi but still were recognized as separate languages, it is clear to see that these languages are thriving with plenty of music and films being made in them. \n\nMeanwhile Braj is slowly becoming extinct, and no one even knows of its existence to bother. \n\nI don't know what I expect to gain from posting this on this sub - maybe someone with more knowledge on these languages can tell me my fears are unfounded or that measures are in fact being taken to save the language? I'm banned on r/India otherwise I'd probably consider posting there.",

In my undergrad, I have only taken an Intro to Syntax course in which we learned some basic X-bar Theory and I am yet to take an Intro to Morphology course so my knowledge is somewhat limited. \n\nMy first thought was that it has to do with the movement of \"Don't\" into the C position above \"you\" in Spec TP, in which \"don't\" is treated as one unit so it can move into that head position. Whereas in \"Do not you dare\", it wouldn't be accepted because \"Do\" and \"not\" can't both move as separate units as there is only one head position open above Spec TP in the tree. I thought about the examples of \"Aren't you coming?\" vs. \"Are you not coming?\" and how when contracted the unit of \"Aren't\" moves together as a head in T to C movement but when separated \"not\" doesn't move and remains in a lower position. This was what I based my conclusion on but I'm not sure if it relates. \n\nI have absolutely no idea if I am even on the right track with this and was hoping someone might have a better explanation as to what might be going on. I am also unsure about how contractions are treated in an X-bar system as we never covered that in class. Furthermore, my understanding of morphology is very limited so I'm not sure if there's an explanation there that I am completely unaware of. \n\nThanks!",
