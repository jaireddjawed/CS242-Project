It might be clear to someone who knows how it works but clearly not to me.  \n\nThen I have the Multiple Programs, Multiple Data designs which in my notes is just explained as \"A Machine not running SPMD, so each processor running potentially different programs e.g. master-slave models or systolic pipelines.\" I have no idea what the lecturer is on about and googling it makes it even more confusing.\n\nTo be completely frank, my lecturer made his notes in a way that they are perfectly clear to himself and anybody who is already familiar with whatever he is talking about which is not particularly good for me.",

To this end, she works on designing and constructing nucleic-acid systems from scratch that exhibit programmable behaviors from the basic level—such as recognizing molecular events from the environment, processing information, making decisions, and taking actions—to the advanced level, such as learning and evolving.",

        "text": "The [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of a string is defined as the size of the smallest program (i.e., Turing machine) that outputs the string. This might seem like it would vary widely depending on the programming language (or Turing machine representation) used, but there is a theorem that shows there is some constant such that (e.g.) the difference in size between the smallest Ruby program and the smallest Java program for any string is bounded by a constant (specifically, the length of the smallest Ruby interpreter written in Java). Unfortunately, it can also be shown that Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable using a self-referential concept known as the [Berry paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_paradox): consider \"the smallest positive integer not definable in fewer than twelve words\" (note that this defining phrase has eleven words).\n\nMy question is whether there is a similar notion of Kolmogorov complexity for functions or decision problems, i.e., the length of the smallest Turing machine that implements the function. Is this even a coherent idea? I could not find any mention of this concept on the web, which is surprising, since it seems like it would be an obvious extension of algorithmic information theory.

Bases upon the feedback from everyone else within my school and major, everyone says that it is tough and I wanted to know the opinions of anyone who has taken this course as well and could give me some advice of how I could be prepared for the class.Any piece of advice will do fine I just want to be able to pass the class with a B or A-. As far as knowledge of the subject I know a little bit about cryptography from my discrete math course and recently Algorithm analysis course! So I know the basics of it! Thank you to whoever has any advice in advance! also this the book we are using for the class as well. https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YRJRH66NL._SR600%2C315_PIWhiteStrip%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C35_PIAmznPrime%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C-5_PIStarRatingFOUR%2CBottomLeft%2C360%2C-6_SR600%2C315_ZA(23%20Reviews)%2C445%2C286%2C400%2C400%2Carial%2C12%2C4%2C0%2C0%2C5_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg",
