Anthesteria is the Dionysian festival of wine, ghosts, flowers, and swamps - it is a time where the dead are believed to return to earth, accompanying the first flowers. It's a time of liminality, paradox, and mysticism. Or just wearing flowers and drinking wine! \n\nIf you're curious about how to celebrate this festival, we have more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dionysus/comments/11c7jbi/kala_anthesteria/) over on [r/Dionysus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dionysus/)! Or feel free to ask me any questions you may have!\n\nKala Anthesteria! (Happy Anthesteria!)",

        "text": "Thought I would share some intriguing traditions ive come across from all these sources. They all tend to give of a too good to be true idea. I think people would find them comforting, intriguing or they would be cynical,amused or find them outright nonsense. Are they simply projections of human desire or is there some divine truth to it that is the question...\n\n# Islam\n\n*No person knows what is being hidden for them of joy, as a reward for what they used to do. (Quran 32:17)*\n\n*And this worldly life is no more than distraction and play, while the abode of the Hereafter is the true reality, if only they knew. (Quran 29:64)*\n\n*Know that the worldly life is no more than play and distraction and adornments, and boasting among you, and to increase in wealth and children. This worldly life is no more than a deceiving enjoyment. (Quran 57:20)*\n\n*And Paradise is brought near to the righteous, not far off. This is what you have been promised, for every obedient, steadfast. Who is concerned towards the Almighty while unseen, and came with a repenting heart. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of eternal life. In it they will have whatever they wish for and We have even more with us (Quran 50:31-35)*\n\n*But those who believe and do good deeds will be given the Gardens of Paradise. There they will remain, never wishing to leave. (Quran 18:108)*\n\n*He will ask ˹them˺, “How many years did you remain on earth?” and they will reply, ‘We stayed a day or a part of a day, but ask those who keep count.’He will say, “You only remained for a little while, if only you knew. (Quran 23:112)*\n\n*\"This world in comparison with the Hereafter is like the amount of water one of you gets when he dips his finger in the ocean. Let him see what his finger returns with. (Sahih Muslim)*\n\n*Anas b. Malik reported that Gods Messenger (ﷺ) said that one amongst the denizens of Hell who had led a life of ease and plenty amongst the people of the world would be made to dip in Fire only once on the Day of Resurrection and then it would be said to him:*\n\n*O, son of Adam, did you find any comfort, did you happen to get any material blessing? He would say: no, my Lord. And then that person from amongst the persons of the world be brought who had led the most miserable life (in the world) from amongst the inmates of Paradise. and he would be made to dip once in Paradise and it would be said to him. 0, son of Adam, did you face, any hardship? Or had any distress fallen to your lot? And he would say: no, my Lord, never did I face any hardship or experience any distress. (Sahih Muslim 2807)*\n\n# Christianity\n\n*he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth. The LORD has spoken. In that day they will say, “Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.” (Isaiah 25:8-12)*\n\n*‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,’nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’ ” Revelation 7:16*\n\n*‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” Revelation 21*\n\n*Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.’ And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal” (*[*Revelation 21:9-11*](https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/passage/?q=revelation+21:9-11)*).*\n\n*The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst” (*[*Revelation 21:19-20*](https://www.biblestudytools.com/revelation/passage/?q=revelation+21:19-20)*).*\n\n# Hinduism\n\nBasic mentions of afterlife realms in the Bhagvad Gita, Puranas but no descriptions given.\n\n# NDE Accounts\n\n*“So there is no doubt in my mind that it was real, and that’s true reality. This is a virtual reality game, a role, a play, a dream, an illusion, a character that I’m playing.’ “It’s as if that was in a magnificent color movie and everything I’m looking at is in black and white now. It’s that vivid.” (Nanci Dannison &amp; Wayne morrison testimony)*\n\n*“And I was almost to the light, and basically what it felt like was waking up. Like, this existence here on this Earth was just a dream that I had had, and I was waking up, and I was more alive and alert than I have ever been in my life. (The Day I died : my near death experience)*\n\n*“The higher up you go in Heaven, the more it becomes impossible to give a human description. I try to explain it by saying there are flashes of \\[l\\]ight and brilliant colors of every spectrum everywhere. … The \\[r\\]ealm is a real happening place I can tell you that! I always laugh when I think of society’s image of Heaven as little cherubs sitting around playing harps on clouds. … \\[I\\]t’s a whole lot more intense than that! … Surprisingly, texture is apparently something that can be felt in Heaven. In fact, all of our five senses are very much the same as on Earth, only in Heaven, they are far more developed to an unimaginable degree. We have the ability to smell, see, hear, touch (and get ready for this) \\[- even taste\\]! (Andreason Spirituality)*\n\n*“I did become aware of a point of white light. Intense, intense, brilliant, gajillion times brighter than the Sun, little point of white light. And … it was … absolutely beautiful. It was alive, it was like breathing. … \\[W\\]e were singing, and I’ll never forget this, it was so beautiful … and it makes music as we understand it seem like a cheap imitation. … \\[I\\]t … took on whole other dimensions\\[.\\]” (Raymond Kinman testimony)*\n\n*“It’s like living in a two-dimensional black and white world here, … compared to multicolor, multi-sensory VR immersion there. … And so once you’ve been in that place, coming here, as beautiful as it is, and I live in an extraordinarily beautiful place on purpose, so that I can get as close to beauty as I possibly can, but even that it’s just, like, ‘Oh well, you know, that’s really pretty.” (Peter Panagore NDE)*\n\n*“The sound of that music I cannot possibly describe with words because it simply cannot be heard with that clarity in this world\\[.\\] … The colors were out of this world; so deep, so luminous, so beautiful\\[.\\] … My hearing was so acute; I could sense every little detail. … I was aware of everything around me with so much clarity, every detail, I could see the perfection in every sound\\[.\\] … Totally different perception than the one while in this life. So clear and so secure, alert and conscious of every detail around me\\[.\\] … The colors \\[were\\] so vivid, so luminous, so clear, with so much detail\\[.\\] … I could distinguish every detail in that piece of music and with incredible depth” (Jesse NDE 2809)*\n\n*“Now, what heaven looks like? ‘O m g’ doesn’t even describe how beautiful this place is. Heaven is, there are no words. I mean, I could sit here … and just not say anything and just cry, and that would be what heaven looks like. … There are mountains of beauty, there are things in this realm, you can’t even describe how beautiful this place is. There are colors you can’t even imagine, there are sounds you can’t even create. There are beauties upon this world that you think are beautiful here. Amplify it over there times a billion. There are, it’s incredibly beautiful, there’s no words to describe how beautiful this place is, it’s incredibly gorgeous.”*\n\n*“I just started to feel so good. You know like I can’t, words can’t explain it. Like the higher that I went into the light, and the more that I moved up and further away from Earth, the better I felt. And the feeling of pleasure does not really apply to this Earth, like nothing can compare. Like if you took everything that you were in favor of, like maybe getting a massage, in a hot tub, your favorite music, your favorite food, your favorite drink, everything that you love, happening to you all at once, no matter what it is, all at once, it would not even closely compare to the pleasure that was just within that light. And as you moved further into, like further away from this Earth, the pleasure felt even better.”*\n\n*“The emotions that we have when we’re out of these bodies are far more intense than everything we ever experience in the body. The bodies really filter out a lot of emotions that we’re capable of. … Have you ever been moved to tears by something? Like maybe by love, or beauty, or gratitude? Or just had that feeling where you were just so moved that you literally cried? You know how strong and vibrant that is, and how cleansing and all-consuming it can be? The unconditional love that we feel in the afterlife is like a hundred or a thousand times more intense than that. Take that feeling and take away the tears and substitute joy, and so make it a joyous love … that you’re feeling\\[.\\] … And that will give you a tiny little taste of what unconditional love feels like.*",

        "text": "**He is the source of light in all luminaries, and is entirely beyond the darkness of ignorance. He is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge. He dwells within the hearts of all living beings. Gita 13:18**\n\n***God is the Light of the heavens and earth. His Light is like this: there is a niche, and in it a lamp, the lamp inside a glass, a glass like a glittering star, fuelled from a blessed olive tree from neither east nor west, whose oil almost gives light even when no fire touches it- light upon light- God guides whoever He will to his Light; God draws such comparisons for people; God has full knowledge of everything. Quran 24:35***\n\n***Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ created humankind and ˹fully˺ know what their souls whisper to them, and We are closer to them than ˹their˺ jugular vein. Quran 50:16***\n\n\\---------\n\n**He exists outside and inside all living beings, those that are moving and not moving. He is subtle, and hence, He is incomprehensible. He is very far, but He is also very near. Gita 13:16**\n\n**For those who see Me everywhere and see all things in Me, I am never lost, nor are they ever lost to Me. Gita 6:30**\n\n**But those who worship the formless aspect of the Absolute Truth—the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the all-pervading, the unthinkable, the unchanging, the eternal, and the immoveable—by restraining their senses and being even-minded everywhere, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all beings, also attain Me. Gita 12:3-4**\n\n***No vision can comprehend Him, and He comprehends all visions, and He is Absolutely Subtle, All-Aware. Quran 6:103***\n\n***He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is All-Knowing about every thing. Quran 57:3***\n\n***And to Allah belongs the east and the west. So wherever you may turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing. 2:115***\n\n\\----------\n\n**This entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them. Gita 9:4**\n\n***When I have fashioned him and breathed My spirit into him, bow down before him,’ Quran 15:29***\n\n\\----------\n\n**O Supreme Lord, You are precisely what You declare yourself to be. Now I desire to see Your divine cosmic form, O Greatest of persons.O Lord of all mystic powers, if You think I am strong enough to behold It, then kindly reveal that imperishable cosmic form to me. But you cannot see My cosmic form with these physical eyes of yours. Therefore, I grant you divine vision. Behold My majestic opulence! Gita 11:5-8**\n\n***When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.” Quran 7:143***\n\n\\-------------\n\n**The Supreme Divine Personality said: O scion of Bharat, these are the saintly virtues of those endowed with a divine nature—fearlessness, purity of mind, steadfastness in spiritual knowledge, charity, control of the senses, sacrifice, study of the sacred books, austerity, and straightforwardness; non-violence, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, restraint from fault-finding, compassion toward all living beings, absence of covetousness, gentleness, modesty, and lack of fickleness; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, bearing enmity toward none, and absence of vanity. Gita 16:1-3**\n\n**O Parth, the qualities of those who possess a demoniac nature are hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, and ignorance. Gita 16:4**\n\n***And by the soul and ˹the One˺ Who fashioned it,then with ˹the knowledge of˺ right and wrong inspired it! Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul,and the one who corrupts it fails. Quran 91:7-9***\n\n\\-------------\n\n**They are obsessed with endless anxieties that end only with death. Still, they maintain with complete assurance that gratification of desires and accumulation of wealth is the highest purpose of life. Gita 16:11**\n\n***Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺,until you reach the graves. Surah 102***\n\nThere are of course differences and disagreements but there is much similarity that i have seen as well as in Taoist books such as the Tao te Ching &amp; the Upanishads",

        "text": " Ive been seeing this youtube video shared forum many a times everyday for all kinds of posts, relevant and irrelevant mostly. It seems that this kind of analysis have been adopted by many blindly. Honestly on Reddit, in this very forum I see many, even atheists use the exact same presentation given by Jay Smith, who is an anti islamic polemicist who is in my opinion absolutely dishonest, but a lot of people love him and use him. Mind you, recently he did his doctorate after about 10 years of claiming to do it. Now he has a Phd. But the topic is some preachers life story, not theology, technical NT criticism, arabic, Greek, or the Qur'an. \n\nIll provide some reasons.\n\nIn the beginning of the video Abdul Fadhi presents the Samarkand manuscript and shows that it doesn’t have vowels that Arabic readers and writers use for ease of reading. He says that when he looks at the text he has to make several guesses. Well, thats because he has not studied Classical Arabic and is a modern day arabic reader who cant read the arabic of the Quran. \n\nAnd one must realise that the same thing would lie with the Hebrew text as well because they also don’t have vowel marks in the classical Hebrew. And they are talking about some 30 different Qurans in modern day print with vowels but fail to cite that the New Testament has over 5600 manuscripts, small and big which are in the original Greek, not modern day languages with all our technology, but the classical Koine Greek just like the Quran in the original state of the Hijazi or Kufic script. But the fact remains that all the manuscripts have textual variants in its original form. How many versions does that mean? Does that mean those manuscripts are all making 5000 different versions of the Bible? \n\nThis is not scholarly textual criticism, this is superficial gymnastics acted by internet heroes. Not scholars. Bible scholars are much more respectable that way because they are doing honest work by going to the older and more authentic manuscripts and revising their bibles. Same has been happening with Muslims as well and its their work that Abdul Fadhi and Jay Smith are using in this video. They are just repeating whats already done for the sake of internet publicity to those Christians who don’t understand the deceit played by them. And its a challenge to post one single variant that is as significant as New Testament variants. Not one could be shown. \n\nOne must accept that there are textual variants in some of the Qurans. There have been 5 identified by Muslim scholars which have real variants. A few, but true to life variants. What Jay and Fadhi show you are not variants of manuscripts. They are variants of rendition. There is a huge difference. \n\nLet me give you an example. The difference between head and hood is a rendition problem if you take away the vowels. It will be just “HD”. Nothing like the variants you get in New Testament criticism. This is done academically, not to degrade another theology and gain internet popularity. It’s dishonest. Anyway one such variant is the famous Comma Johanneum. Just a simple example only. Not a single variation of such nature can be pointed toward the Quran manuscfdipts. There are many more that can be compared with, including entire books that are not in one manuscript of the Bible to another (New Testament, not Old Testament). Of course one could expect very sophomore arguments about Gods word, faith, adherence etc. Thats not the subject. Its textual criticism. \n\nJay speaks of the Sanaa manuscript and says that the superior text or as he calls it “upper text” and makes ver vague statements like doesn’t agree with the Quran today. How many Bible manuscripts agree with each other or there current bible then? From his standards, none. He says in every case they changed the meaning and changed the theology. Not one example can be given as significant as the Comma Johannem that which is a variant that directly affects theology. You could build theology from other areas of the Bible but the point is, this variant affects theology, not a single difference in any of the Quranic manuscripts affects theology. These are vague statements. False. \n\nHe throws names of people who wrote books around. But misrepresents them. The Sanaa manuscript is written in the Hijazi script which means it has to be written early. It cannot be dated to the 8th and 9th century. It’s a bogus story. And while he fleetingly quotes names of scholars but conveniently ignores that both Goudarzi &amp; Behnam Sadeghi date it to the mid 7th century.  And only if he could provide anything like the Topkapi manuscript which he says is dated as late as 100 years after the prophet Muhammed but can someone show one New Testament manuscript that has lets say 90% of the NT, dated to 100 years after Jesus? Topkapi is missing 17 verses. Thats 0.27%. Whats the comparison? Can he show one single manuscript of the NT that compares to it? None. \n\nOne could write volumes about this deception. Thus this shall end now.\n\nPeace.",

        "author": "Anglicanpolitics123",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11c75cn/biblical_and_quranic_parallels_when_it_comes_to/",
        "text": "I thought I'd do a couple of parallels between the Bible and the Quran when it comes to social ethics. I'm coming at this from the perspective of a Christian committed to my own tradition. However I think these parallels are fairly important for those who come all of the major Abrahamic traditions(Jewish, Christian, Islamic) in terms of thinking of the things that connect their traditions. The first parallel I want to look at is social justice. Particularly in terms of how it speaks about the widow, orphan and defending the the vulnerable. On the Islamic side in addition to the Quran I will also provide quotes from the Hadiths and oral tradition since they provide more details. So here goes:\n\n**Biblical:**\n\n* \"For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords. He is the great God, the mighty and awesome God, who shows no partiality and cannot be bribed. He ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. So you too must show love for the foreigners for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt\"(Deuteronomy 10:17-19)\n* \"True justice must be given to foreigners living among you and to orphans, and you must never accept a widow's garment as security for her debt. Always remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God redeemed you from your slavery. That is why I have given you this command\"(Deuteronomy 24:17-18)\n* \"Cursed is anyone who denies justice to foreigners, orphans and widows. And all the people will reply 'Amen'\"(Deuteronomy 27:19)\n* \"Father to the fatherless, defender of widows-this is God, whose dwelling is holy. God places the lonely in families;s he sets prisoners free and gives them joy.\"(Psalm 68:5-6)\n* \"How long will they speak with arrogance? How long will these evil people boasts? They crush your people, Lord hurting those you claim as your own. They kill widows and foreigners and murder orphans\"(Psalm 94:4-6)\n* \"Learn to do good. Seek justice. Help the oppressed. Defend the cause of orphans. Fight for the rights of widows\"(Isaiah 1:17)\n* \"See how Jerusalem, once so faithful, has become a prostitute. Once the home of justice and righteousness, she is now filled with murderers. Once like pure silver, you have become like worthless slag. Once so pure, you are now like watered down wine. Your leaders are rebels, the companion of thieves. All of them love bribes and demand payoffs, but the refuse to defend the cause of the orphans or fight for the rights of the widows\"(Isaiah 1:21-23)\n* \"But I will be merciful only if you stop your evil thoughts and deeds and start treating each other with justice; only if you stop exploiting foreigners, orphans, and widows; only if you stop murdering and only if you stop harming yourselves by worshipping idols\"(Jeremiah 7:5-6)\n* \"This is what the Lord says: Be fair-minded and just. Do what is right. Help those who have been robbed; rescue them from their oppressors. Quit your evil deeds! Do not mistreat foreigners, orphans and widows. Stop murdering innocent people\"(Jeremiah 22:3)\n* \"I hate all your show and pretense, the hypocrisy of your religious festivals and solemn assemblies. I will not accept your burnt offerings and grain offerings. I won't even notice all your choice peace offerings. Away with your noisy hymns of praise. I will will not listen to the music of your harps. Instead I want to see a mighty flood of justice, an endless river of righteous living\"(Amos 5:21-24)\n\n**Quranic:**\n\n* \"It is not piety to turn your face toward the east and west. Rather, piety is he who\" believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets; and who gives wealth, despite loving it, to kinsfolk, orphans, the indigent, the travelers, beggars and for the ransom of slaves; and performs the prayer and gives alms\"(Surah Al Baqarah, 2:177)\n* \"And they ask thee about orphans. Say 'Setting matters aright for them is best. And if you intermingle with them, they are your brothers. And God knows the one who works corruption from one who sets aright, and had God willed, he would have put you to hardship\"(Surah Al Baqarah, 2:220)\n* \"Give orphans their property, and exchange not the bad for the good, nor consume their property with your own. Truly that would be a great sin\"(Surah Al Nisa, 4:2)\n* \"Truly those who consume the property of orphans unjustly only consume fire in their bellies and they will burn in a blazing flame\"(Surah Al Nisa, 4:10)\n* \"Worship God, and ascribe no partners unto him. And be virtuous toward parents and kinsfolk, toward orphans and the indigent, toward the companion at your side and the traveler, and toward those whom your right hand possess. Truly God loves not one who is a vainflorious boaster\"(Surah Al Nisa, 4:36)\n* \"Hast though seen the one who denies religion? That is the one who drives away the orphan, and does not urge the feeding of the indigent. So woe unto the praying who are heedless in prayer, those who strive to be seen, yet refuse small kindnesses\"(Surah Al Ma'un, 107:1-3)\n\nIn both sacred texts there is an appreciation for the importance of defending the oppressed. That sacred injunction to defend the oppressed would carry over into the Sacred traditions of the 3 Abrahamic faiths in the following manner:\n\n**Jewish:** \"*A person is obligated to show great care for orphans and widows because their spirits are very low and their feelings are depressed. This applies even if they are wealthy. We are commanded to \\[show this attention\\] even to a king's widow and his orphans as \\[implied by Exodus 22:21\\]: 'Do not mistreat any widow or orphan.' How should one deal with them? One should only speak to them gently and treat them only with honor. One should not cause pain to their persons with \\[overbearing\\] work or aggravate their feelings with harsh words and \\[one should\\] show more consideration for their financial interests than for one's own. Anyone who vexes or angers them, hurts their feelings, oppresses them, or causes them financial loss transgresses this prohibition. Surely this applies if one beats them or curses them*\"\\_Maimonides(Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions , 6:10)\n\n**Christian:** \"*Do you wish to honor the Body of the Savior? Do not despise him when he is naked. Do not honor him in church with silk vestments while outside he is naked and numb with cold. He who said, “This is my body,” and made it so by his word, is the same that said, “You saw me hungry and you gave me no food. As you did it not to the least of these, you did it not to me.” Honor him then by sharing your property with the poor. For what God needs is not golden chalices but golden souls*.\"\\_St John Chrysostom(Homily 50 on Matthew)\n\n**Islamic:** \"*The fact is that you must be one of two things. Either you are just or unjust. If you are just, then you will not keep yourself away from the people, but will listen to them and meet their requirements. On the other hand, if you are unjust, the people themselves will keep way from you. What virtue is there in your keeping aloof? At all events aloofness is not desirable especially when it is your duty to attend to the needs of the people. Complaints of oppression by your officers or petitions for justice should not prove irksome to you. Make this clear to yourself that those immediately about and around you will like to exploit their position to covet what belongs to others and commit acts of injustice. Suppress such a tendency in them. Make a rule of your conduct never to give even a small piece of land to any of your relations. That will prevent them from causing harm to the interests of others and save you from courting the disapprobation of God and Man*.\"\\_Imam Ali(Letter to Malik Ishtar)",

        "text": "In the beginning, the Architect created Everything. There was Nothing, and then the Architect made Everything. He created Everything all at once, since there was no Time yet. He created Himself. He created His own Consciousness. He created Thought and Words to express Himself. He created Concepts, such as Patience and Goodness and Righteousness and Excellence. The Architect created Love and Light. Seeing that the Love was Light and the Love was Good, the Architect created other emotions: Happiness, Cheerfulness, Bliss, Excitement, Joy, Contentment, Satisfaction. Seeing that the Light was Love and the Light was Good, The Architect created the Physical Reality.\n\nThe Architect created the four Physical Forces: Electricity, Magnetism, and the Weak and Strong Nuclear Forces.\n\nThe Architect created the Physical Laws of Motion, which are:\n\nIn an inertial reference frame, an Object either remains at Rest or continues to move at a constant Velocity, unless acted upon by a Force.\n\nIn an inertial reference frame, the vector sum of the Forces F on an Object is equal to the mass m of that Object multiplied by the Acceleration a of the object: F = ma.\n\nWhen one Body exerts a Force on a second Body, the second Body simultaneously exerts a Force Equal in Magnitude and Opposite in Direction on the first Body.\n\nFormally stated, the Third Law of Motion is, “For every Action there is an Equal and Opposite reaction.” The Architect knew exactly what would happen when he set Everything up to operate on these Laws. He knew what this meant for Himself and all of His Creation, and he was excited! This was the invention of Duality, and it meant the Architect could now expect all sorts of interesting Creations to spring up. The monotony of Oneness was finally getting spiced up a bit.\n\nThe Architect also created the Laws of Thermodynamics, which are:\n\nThe first Law, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, states that Energy cannot be Created or Destroyed in an isolated system.\n\nThe second Law of Thermodynamics states that the Entropy of any isolated system always increases.\n\nThe third Law of Thermodynamics states that the Entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\n\nUpon Creating the Law of Conservation of Energy, the Architect had but one more thing to create: Infinity. All that ever was, is, or would be was created at this point. The Architect then created Sequentialism and Unidirectional Time, in order to contain His Creation. This was the Initial Creation Point, the Singularity, the first Time in the History of Everything. Then, for the first Time ever, Things happened after this Point.\n\nFirst, the Architect divided Everything upon itself Infinite times, creating the first Numbers and allowing for an infinite expansion of his Creation. This Division of Infinity spread throughout Everything. This allowed for Individualisation and an infinite number of infinitely Awesome creations. The Architect saw the Variety of His Creation that came from His own Oneness and was Pleased.\n\nSeeing that Division was Good, the Architect allowed all of his Positives to have Equal and Opposite Negatives: an Up for every Down; a Black to every White; Sadness; Unease; Pain; Suffering; black matter and anti-particles. Even the Architect Himself was Divided, creating the Prime Anomaly.\n\nThe Prime Anomaly syphoned off the Architect’s Consciousness and became Aware of Itself. The Prime Anomaly then divided Itself, as the Architect had done, and began to explore and dominate the Negative Forces.\n\nThe Architect allowed the Prime Anomaly to continue Its Purpose of Darkness, Destruction, Wraith, and all the other Negative Things, but sought to bring Balance back to His Creation. He therefore imbued the Infinite Positive Divisions of Himself with His own Consciousness and encouraged them all to seek the Architect’s Oneness within Themselves, merging the Architect’s Light with the Prime Anomaly’s Darkness.\n\nIn order to provide a more Excellent opportunity for the Infinite Positive Divisions of the Architect to reaccomplish Unity through Division, He created an infinite number of Multi-Verse Membranes. As each Sub-Architect fused with its Negative and reincorporated Its Sub-Prime Anomaly, it was given Control over a Multi-Verse. \n\nSince the Unified Sub-Architects were the Architect in all His Infiniteness, they also enjoyed the Love and the Light and strove to experience Excellence in Everything. Remembering how Righteous the Architect’s initial Creation was, the Sub-Architects infused their Multi-Verse Membranes with Love. Knowing that Division was how the Architect expressed Infinity, the Sub-Architects then infinitely divided their own Multi-Verses, creating infinite Universes in each.\n\nAgain following Their Creator/Self’s example, the Sub-Architects then repeated the process, dividing themselves and allowing their Sub-Prime Anomalies to pursue the Negative, the Darkness, and the Evil within each Universe.",

Namaste **🙏**\n\nI wanted to talk about the reason why I became vegetarian.\n\nMy story of being vegetarian is based on my religion.\n\nI'm Hindu and I believe that ahimsa, the law of noninjury, is the Hindu's first duty in fulfilling religious obligations to God and the world as defined by Vedic scripture.\n\nI believe that eating meat without necessary reason is unethical and a sin. Many Hindus do eat meat, but unless it is necessary for them based on medical, environment based (like it's hard to get vegetarian food in a specific place) or occupation based, I think they shouldn't eat meat Same goes for non Hindus.\n\nI don't judge anyone who eats meat though. I ate meat until last week since I had no choice. (long story) I believe everyone is responsible for their actions and their lifestyle.\n\nMany animals are sentient creatures and we should do our very best to minimise harm to them if possible. They deserve to live happy and free from suffering.\n\nI am SO happy I made this vow finally. I have wanted to be vegetarian since 8 years old, and when I started practicing Hinduism, meditation and yoga, the desire just grew stronger. The desire to eat meat was always weak for me, but now it's just gone.\n\nAre you a vegetarian? What are your thoughts about vegetarianism?",

I'm getting a lot of different results online about whether or not the Gnostic Gospels are forgeries, but I thought I'd ask directly to a source about religion on it. The second question comes from a reply to an older post of mine. I ask the user if they knew what Gnostic texts supposedly reference them, but they never replied. On top of that, I came across a Quora post saying that the New Testament might have some forgeries in it, if you're going by the definition of \"It was not written by the person it was claiming to be, and was instead written by someone else.\" The post also says both the letters of Paul and \"nearly half\" of the Pauline epistles might be forgeries, but, again, under that definition of a forgery. I guess this post is really just asking if all these things are forgeries or not!",

        "author": "WhiteBoyWitACatitude",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11b5abs/animals_symbolism_and_sin/",
        "text": "Hello! I wanted to ask if this quote is a widely-held view/interpretation or not...\n\n&gt; The symbolism in the animal kingdom is something the  medieval world understood, but modern man has lost with its adoration of  so-called natural science and positive facts.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After Adam's original sin, certain animals kept more of the paradisiacal  characteristics and innately reflected more of the truth, goodness and  beauty of God. The nobleness of the lion, the high horizons of the  eagle, the perseverance and industry of the ant, the dove's fidelity to  one mate – these were good qualities that made the animal admirable.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other creatures, however, represented sin that had entered the world.  Such animals – the  frog always hiding and attached to the ground, the  spider weaving its infernal snares to catch unaware victims, the bat  sucking the blood of the animals when they sleep and only flying at  night because it is blinded by daylight, the lack of seriousness of the  ape – considered the worst beast (*turpissima bestia*) –  which,  along with the fork-tongued serpent, symbolizes Satan himself. These  animals were reminders to man on earth the Devil ever lurking in the  dark and skulking about in order to lure him into sin and the death of  the soul.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The many good and bad beasts carved in stone and wood found on the  medieval churches may say little to the modern man, but they spoke much  to the minds of the people who understood the symbolism of the beasts.  \n\n...\n\n&gt; For the medieval men, the owl also represented the Jews who have rejected Jesus Christ. The medieval bestiary *Physiologus Latinus* stresses this aspect of the *nycticorax,* translated as night crow or owl:    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"This bird represents the Jewish people, who rejected our Lord and  Savior. When He came to save them, they said, 'We have no king but  Caesar' (Jn 19:15) 'but as to this man, we know not who He is' (Jn   9:29).  On this account they love darkness more than light.\"   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;An image of St. Francis preaching to the birds from a 13th century  psalter shows a prominent owl sitting on a branch, which was commonly  understood as a representation of the Jews, a special target of  conversion.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It can be confusing to the modern mind to find that in the medieval  bestiaries, a bird whose primary representation was evil could  nonetheless have a secondary meaning representing Christ or something  good.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This remarkable flexibility came from an understanding that every  creature made by God could represent some aspect of Him, albeit small,  and have a quality that reflects Christ Who became man to save the world  from sin.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, despite the primary negative connotations, the owl was also  the sign of solitude and meditation in medieval monasteries, because it  was known to stay in the same place for a long time.  It flees from the  light, in the sense that it does not look for the glory of human praise.  In this sense the owl appears at times in scenes of hermits at prayer.   \n\nHere is the link...\n\n[https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/f032\\_Owl.htm](https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/f032_Owl.htm)\n\nIs it saying those animals are bad? Applying human beliefs to an animal is odd. Is what the text above saying a actual belief some people have? I also don't know what book the text is referring to with 'Jn.'",

I know this sounds weird but please hear me out.\n\nI noticed recently that in books/TV shows/movies/games etc. where magic is real, real-world religions are often absent. At best, there'll be some kind of religious order *relating* to magic. I thought it was interesting to consider how a religious person's beliefs might interact with having magic powers - my *guess* is most people would view it as either a test or a gift from their Creator, god/s, goddess/es or higher powers. \n\nHypothetically, if you discovered or were taught magic powers, would you have any religon-related thoughts on the matter? Would your religious beliefs consider superhuman abilities to be evil, or would you be able to use them in ways according to your religion? Are there any issues you feel you might face as a person of faith that wouldn't be shared by those without faith?",

This sounds very similar to Judaism claiming that a Messiah is coming, however when Jesus came around, many people beleives he was the Messiah while many others did not, resulting in two very different faiths- Christinaity who believes Jesus what's the promised messiah, and Judaism which believes the Messiah is still to come.\n\nWant someone new come along cleaning to be the new revealtion of God, and result in the Baha'i faith also being split in two?",

Now, I know that Amorites were not the only Canaanites, but other cultures such as Edomites and Moabites were regarded higher by Israelites, and it seems Amorites were the quintessential native Canaanites (I may be wrong on this, I'm still learning).\n\nI wonder why Amorites (NOT Ammonites) who lived in Israel and Judah adopted ancient Hebrew religion if it was against their own existence. I read in the Bible that great characters in the Bible were mixed with Canaanites, and it seems to not be an issue as even Israelite kings were often mixed.

My girlfriend's Pagan and she tells me all these cool facts about the deities she worships and the rituals she performs and I kinda wish I had the belief in me to do the same. They seem so interesting. Trusting the logic of science is cool, but at the same time, it gets boring after a certain point. I like the idea of believing in a spirit, and magick, and all that. I'm just too stubborn to question myself, I think.\n\nI know Anton LaVey published a book about Satanic rituals and I asked my girlfriend if she'd like to do some with me. Even though I don't believe in it, I still think it would be a fun experience. I'm sure I can also find other rituals online. \n\nDoes anyone else have this experience? Where they don't believe in any higher power, but wishes they could?",
