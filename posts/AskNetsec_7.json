One example of that is this:  \n\n\n152.199.24.214 443 -&gt; 10.0.0.65 7546 TLSv1.2 3454 Server Hello, Certificate, Server Key Exchange, Server Hello Done\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat IP seems to belong to bitdefender:  [https://www.shodan.io/host/152.199.24.214](https://www.shodan.io/host/152.199.24.214)  \n\n\nI'm going to focus on this one, but I have other examples from other relatively normal looking IP's (Microsoft, Nvidia).  This particular one has a common name of  \\*.edgecast.net   In the PCAP, it looks like a digicert certificate:  \n\n\nCertificates (2971 bytes)\n\nCertificate Length: 839\n\nCertificate: 308203433082022b02144ecf5c8cce6a279b7ac119a10ccb603a8df24d6e300d06092a86… (id-at-commonName=\\*.edgecastcdn.net,id-at-organizationName=Dis,id-at-localityName=Springfield,id-at-stateOrProvinceName=Denial,id-at-countryName=US)\n\nCertificate Length: 1176\n\nCertificate: 308204943082037ca003020102021001fda3eb6eca75c888438b724bcfbc91300d06092a… (id-at-commonName=DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server CA,id-at-organizationName=DigiCert Inc,id-at-countryName=US)\n\nCertificate Length: 947\n\nCertificate: 308203af30820297a0030201020210083be056904246b1a1756ac95991c74a300d06092a… (id-at-commonName=DigiCert Global Root CA,id-at-organizationalUnitName=www.digicert.com,id-at-organizationName=DigiCert Inc,id-at-countryName=US)\n\nIf I extract the cert though, its just a self signed, and not a digicert.  This is the same as what I see with the others.  This does not seem to be actually related to ransomware, at least as far as I can tell.  I do not have any access to the host were this connection was made, just visibility to the traffic.  Nothing else stands out though.  It does not seem legit of course, because why the strange field names?   Why a self signed?  But how could this be coming from a legit IP?  Why do these field names line up so perfectly with some older shennanigans?",

We are currently using a tool named \"FTAPI\". It works great, but I am really interested in alternatives or your approach.\n\nI am aware of the following methods:\n\n* Using encrypted zip files protected by a password. The password is communicated to the client via a second channel.\n   * Disadvantage is the need to communicate the decryption password via a second channel.\n* Using one of the various E2E file transfer products that rely on the decryption key being placed inside the file's access link (url) after #. So the decryption happens on the client side.\n   * Disadvantage is that anyone with knowledge of the link can just access the files. No additional user authentication needed.\n      * If an additional password prompt is required , we are again in need to communicate the password via a second channel. \n      * Additional features like limiting how often the link can be accessed is often bricked by 3rd party link scanners like Microsoft's Secure Link.\n* General SMIME/PGP mail encryption\n   * Disadvantage is that many companies and clients don't have it.\n\nWhat's your approach?

And then it encrypts that key with any number of passwords I enter. So, if I enter 10 passwords, it will have 10 encrypted keys. Later, if I enter any one of the 10 passwords, it will be able to decrypt the key, and use that key to decrypt the data. So, unless I forget all 10 passwords, I would not lose the data.\n\nMy question is, does having n number of keys weaken the security by just 1/n, or more than 1/n? I mean, if it is 1/n, then using 10 passwords would be 1/10 security, but a (2^128)/10 is practically not much different form 2^128 (e.g., like 100 million years instead of 1 billion years for brute force attack).",

So he's thinking it might be worthwhile to report it just to see if they can actually track the funds. As with anything regarding crypto what's not worth much today might be worth a lot tomorrow so he's a little more keen to make some effort that he was a couple of days ago.\n\n\n(See my other posts about his loss for details)\n\nBy the way a possible bug intrusion report relating to Google sign in getting Google drive permissions was made to Google through their bug finders or bug hunters website and a final reply was given that it was quote \"intended behavior.\" More about that in another post.\n\nI'm not sure that was very clear because in the report it was stated that files unrelated to an app that was given sign in privileges were apparently searched and exploited and I would find it hard to believe that the ability to do that is an intended behavior of giving an app or a website Google sign in privileges. I mean I don't know about you but when you're trying to sign up for a website and they ask if you want to do it through Facebook Google or email I think that giving it the Google sign up doesn't mean you're giving them access to all your files it just means that Google is letting them know that you're a real person in some sort of trackable way but perhaps I'm mistaken.",

There may have been a time when they were actually physically linked together with a dual charger cord as well but I don't think so.\n\nHe had used that set up many times before and never had a problem.\n\nHe had a crypto address monitoring program running so he actually got notified in real time as the funds were transferred and he realized the funds that were transferred were from old Bitcoin addresses that he had kept in this text file. \nObviously we all know that you shouldn't keep private keys in a text file so that's not really the issue . no need to say that. It was a very old text file with some very old addresses with not much coin in them. \n\nThe big question is is somebody now able to read his Google drive and or read his phone and how can he check?\n\nHe knows the only txt file that the private keys were on on his Google drive and on his phone. The same txt file was on his phone and on his Google drive. He checked his Google drive to see if that file had been accessed recently and it said it had not been accessed by him recently. I'm assuming Google drive would have thought that anyone who accessed it was him so it would have indicated he accessed it. I'm also assuming that anyone who accessed the file probably did a full scan quickly for Bitcoin related addresses and did the transfer relatively quickly. I doubt someone would have had a txt file unless they knew it had the addressed or they did a complete text scan of his whole Google drive and and or phone somehow. The file name was innocuous so it would have taken a deep scan to detect the Bitcoin and think that file was special in any way. He has gigabytes of files on his Google drive.\n\n the only unusual thing he did one day before the incident was he gave permission for an popular note app on the android app store to link across his Android devices so all notes were merged. He had never done that before.\n\n This apparently gives that app some amount of file storage ability on his Google drive. I'm not sure if that gives that app the complete readability of everything on his Google drive and what happened maybe totally unrelated to that particular program but I'm mentioning it because I'm trying to say it all the circumstances that were in play when the transfer happened.\n\nApparently he was on his Chromebook watching some videos through VLC player and generally browsing the internet on his phone to sites that he had visited many times before. So I'm not sure there was anything unusual in that unless a video file can be hacked so that when VLC runs it it runs a worm or something.\n\nHe actually had a third Android phone also using the Wi-Fi and that phone was acting weird in terms of it was showing its storage was getting very low and it rebooted itself a couple of times. For that matter apparently so did his chromebook. As far as I know he's never shared any finals from his Google drive.\n\nAny thoughts are welcome. Any software or other things that might be used to do some penetration testing to figure out how this thing happened is really kind of the goal because if it's his Google drive he wants to know and if it's somebody's able to read his phones he wants to know and it may be a coincidence that it happened while he was tied to this sort of public network public Wi-Fi or it may not.\n\nThat's all I know thanks.",

Along with that I did discover an enjoyment for programming too and I am a capable programmer, but I'm still drawn towards hacking.\n\nI've never quite got the same satisfaction out of anything that I get when I discover a vulnerability in something and whenever I think of projects in my personal time, my mind jumps towards rooting HTB machines or developing tools to automate penetration testing (I've had a particular idea of 'HackerHarold', a desktop application that automates the enumeration process and handles tests on the OS itself.) I would also love to start playing around with malware development again.\n\nHowever, I had no luck whatsoever in finding a job as a Penetration Tester prior to working in Web Development. I never even got through to the interview stage despite having a Tumblr blog full of work I've done and being OSCP-certified.\n\nI guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to get back into the industry and how to secure a job as a Penetration tester? I do also have web dev experience now too which I can imagine will be beneficial, but I'm not even sure if 6 months of that is enough.\n\nMy blog is here: [https://www.tumblr.com/blog/c-cracks](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/c-cracks)\n\nI haven't done much of anything recently due to university and work but I dropped one of my uni modules for the year (was taking up all of my time) so I am in a position to dedicate a day a week to my goal.",

I understand that I could take notes on the fly with a kindle, Kobo and other eReader, but I never owned one so my experience is limited.\n\nThank you.",

Displaying the hash of a file on a website in order to provide data integrity relies only on the preimage-resistance property of the underlying hash function. \n\n**My Answer**\n\nConfused, since from what I understand from integrity and pre-image resistance, integrity provides the accuracy and consistency of said data whilst the pre-image resistance uses a one-way function which makes it infeasible to break it. It could be true since it stops attackers from modifying the file? But I just do not know if it is the only way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb. ECDSA can be broken by a quantum computer.\n\n**My Answer**\n\nYes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc. Non-repudiation is often provided today using authenticated encryption primitives. \n\n**My Answer**\n\nFrom what I understand, non repudiation can be understood as a property in which somebody cannot deny that they observed, altered or created a piece of data. Since authenticated encryption requires authenticity that the user accessing said data is legitimate, it is true in the sense that the recipient cannot deny observing the information. Still confused though.",
