        "text": "First time poster. I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting.\n\nFirst off I want to say that I have been a server at restaurants for a very long time. So I absolutely understand that restaurants mess up sometimes. But here’s my story.\n\nWe are going to a sports bar that’s relatively popular. We are a party of eight, we call ahead and reserve a table because that’s what you do when you’re a large party. We sit, we order drinks, everything is fine. We order food at 8:30, first plate comes out around 9:10-9:20. Ok, so it took a long time, it’s a bar and we’re not expecting much.\n\nSecond plate comes out fifteen minutes later. Then everything else starts coming out in five to ten minute intervals... except for my wings... We wanted to eat at the same time but whatever.\n\nOur server says that she’s going to another section so we have to close out. We say ok, then she brings us our cards and check slips without showing us our tabs first. I have never been to a bar that does that before, but we go with it.\n\nI still haven’t gotten my wings and it’s about 9:45-9:50. I realize that my server charged my card for wings that I was never going to receive. I flag her down and ask if they were still coming. She says she’ll check, comes back and says that they haven’t even started them. Wait, what?!\n\nAt this point everyone was ready to leave and I wasn’t about to hold up the rest of my party for wings that were probably going to take another hour. Another server said that they couldn’t refund something once the check has been closed. Well maybe if we had been given the tab before we closed out we could have avoided that.\n\nSo the only redeeming quality was that the manager gave me cash to “refund” what I had paid. They were apologetic and I can at least appreciate that. But holy moly, I don’t think I can give that kind of service another chance.",

        "text": "This story is pretty old and from back in 2013 I just found this subreddit ind thought it would be perfect. Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile.\n\nI was finally able to afford a smartphone so I looked around and saw that one company was offering double the data for the normal price so I decided to go with them. I go to one of their stores and order my new phone but was told that I had to wait about a month because it was a new generation and was out of stock everywhere which was fine with me. \n\nAbout a month later I haven’t heard anything from the company and decide to give them another week just incase it was taking extra long for the phone. A week passed and I didn’t hear anything from the company so I called their number and ask about it and was treated like a thief, they told me that there was no record of my order of the phone but I know there is one cause I was looking at the receipt and order form. \n\nAs you can probably Imagine I was pretty pissed off when I went back to the store. I had the same employee and he said that he specifically remembered me because I was the first backorder for that phone that he did, and that everyone else that ordered that phone got thieves a week ago, after finally putting in the order I was told I would have to wait a week, I wasn’t happy but I didn’t have  another option. \n\nThe story didn’t end there though because when I got my phone bill from the first month I realized that they never put on the double the data offer that they had when I originally ordered the phone. I called the customer support and was again treated like I was a thief trying to get the extra Gb of data for free, I eventually got it after three hours on the phone with them. \n\nAfter all of that the company had terrible service everywhere even when I was in the biggest city in the Provence. I eventually ended my contract early and went with another company and have been happy with them ever since. \n\nSorry if this was more of a rant than a story but I’m still mad about this four years later",

        "text": "Hello /TalesFromTheCustomer !\nYou know the drill, LTL, FTP, etcetera\n\nThis happened to me a couple of days ago, and while I was not the retail worker in question I felt it needed to be shared.\n\n(TLDR: I am on the phone with a Customer Service rep when an unruly patron demands an unreasonable coupon. When denied this request, he jumps over the counter and proceeds to attack the workers.)\n\n_____________________________________________________$CSR = Customer Service Representative \n$BlueStore = Big blue US superstore\n$Me = Kind of obvious, don't you think\n\n\nBackground: I was calling $BlueStore in a small town in Connecticut for some item availability questions around 9PM\n_____________________________________________________\n\n&gt; $CSR: Thank you for calling $BlueStore, my name is $CSR how may I help you this evening?\n&gt;$Me: Hi, my name is The_11th_Dctor and I'm wondering if you could tell me what versions of $genericcellphone you have in stock\n&gt;$CSR: Sure, give me one minute and I'll check for you. Let me put you on hold.\n\n\nA couple of minutes pass...\n\n\n&gt;$CSR: Thank you for holding. We seem to be out of $genericcellphone at the moment, but if you would like I can have one special ordered to the .....\n\n\nAt this moment, he trails off and I hear yelling from the other end of the phone, a loud man's voice, but I couldn't quite hear what he was saying..\n\n\n&gt;$CSR: (Sounding scared out of his mind) I'm so sorry, please excuse me one moment.\n\n\nI would assume the heavy sound I heard next was the phone hitting the desk or the floor, and as far as I can tell he dropped it.\n\n\nI hear the conversations a little clearer now, a man yelling at the Customer Service workers over what I could make out as \"Coupons applying to a return\". I didn't think much of it.\n\n\nThen, I hear $CSR's voice, yelling back at the man, threatening to hit the alarm if he doesn't calm down. From the other end of the phone, I then heard a loud crash and screaming. At this point I have to assume the phone was hit in some way, as I could hear less of the words being exchanged. More and more voices joined the chaos and I could hear crashing. \n\nSuddenly, all the sounds stopped and were replaced by the piercing screams of a siren. A couple seconds later, the voices of 2 men broke through the phone, asking everyone to clear out of the area. Silence followed. After a couple of minutes, the phone clicked again, and an older lady's ($OL) voice came through.\n\n&gt;$OL: Hi, is anyone there?\n&gt;$ME: Yes, I am here. What in the world just happened?\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me about an angry young man (Likely in his 20-30's) who came up to the CSR counter, demanding to know why his coupon didn't start working again after he returned the item he had applied it to. $CSR's coworker had explained to him that returns don't affect the coupons, and that the reason it wasn't working was because it was expired. The man got violent, screaming that the employee needed to get him a coupon that worked for what he wanted to. This was when $CSR jumped in to de-escalate the situation.\n\nHe explained that he couldn't do that unless he had a manager present, and even then they could not take off the amount that the man wanted. This only made him angrier, threatening to jump over and cripple the two employees. At this point, $CSR triggered the silent alarm. The man jumped over the counter and started attacking $CSR's co-worker. The three of them fought until the man had knocked out the co-worker and had $CSR in a headlock. One of the other customers ran up with a bat from sporting goods and knocked him out cold just moments before the police showed up.\n\nI found out later that the co-worker went to the ER on grounds of a concussion and a possible broken arm, and $CSR due to a collapsed airway and possible fractured rib.\n\nIf either $CSR or his co-worker are reading this, I hope you are both OK and will not be returning to your previous jobs. This incident gave me a newfound respect for everyone who works retail.\n\nSorry about the length, I feel it was important to share.",

        "text": "So my bf and I were hanging out and around 9pm we decided to go get some food. The restaurant we went to was a chain that gives off the feel of a 50s dinner. Steak burgers and milkshakes and all that jazz. \n\nNow it’s pretty late and even though this place is open 24 hours it’s dead. There’s another couple in there and that’s it so we get seated right away. It’s pretty easy going, there’s only one waitress working but she’s nice and fast so I can’t complain. \n\nJust as we get our food, this couple walks in and stands around. Now they’ve got to be in their late 60s I don’t even understand why they were out this late in the night but here they were. \n\nSo since we had just gotten our food, our waitress asked if we needed refills, sauces all that fun stuff and the lady who has just walked in who I’ll refer to as Old Bitch starts sighing very loudly. My bf and I put in orders for milkshakes and our waitress goes to give it to the kitchen. The waitress goes over and grabs some menus for them and before she can even greet them the Old Bitch goes \n\n“Are you blind or just stupid? We’ve been standing here for 10 minutes!” \n\nThe waitress just forced a smile, apologized and led them to a booth right across from us. The Old Bitch spots me and my bf and scowls before rolling her eyes. I’ve got no clue what she had against me but apparently she can’t stand us. Whatever. My bf and I continue eating.\n\nAt one point this Old Bitch wanders up to the counter and starts banging on it, complaining that she’s been waiting forever for her food even though the order has been put in maybe 5 minutes before. \n\nThe waitress is lovely through all this. Bringing out sauces, giving refills before their drinks were even finished fully, all of the stuff that makes for a good waitstaff. Despite this, this Old Bitch can’t stop complaining and even says “If these immigrants can’t be bothered to work they shouldn’t be in this country.” \n\nI’ve got no clue where she pulled the immigrant thing from since our waitress was clearly white but whatever. \n\nMy bf and I finish our meals as quickly as possible since this Old Bitch has ruined the atmosphere.  As we pass by this ancient, sour woman says “I can’t believe he lets her walk out of the house like that.”  \n\nJust for reference, I’m wearing a t shirt and some leggings, not like my whole ass is hanging out. My bf, who has a short temper and a big mouth on him, whips around and finally shuts this haggard bitch up. \n\n“Look, just because you are miserable with your life doesn’t mean you have to take it out on the rest of the population. I hope you choke on that burger you’ve sent back twice.” My boyfriend says to her and she looks absolutely stunned. He admits it wasn’t his proudest moment but she had been bullying the only waitress and commenting on someone she doesn’t know. \n\nWe walked up front, paid for our meal, found our waitress and handed her a 20 dollar tip before leaving.\n\nFuck that old bitch. \n\n",

I read all the comments and replied to as many as I could. I would love to have replied to more, but I honestly don't have the time. Thank you kind redditors for your comments, they were all extremely helpful and informative.\n\nI'm sure you're all wondering what's happened with my situation since I made my first post. After the large amount of people who asked for a reminder, I decided to do an update post.\n\nI contacted corporate and a manager at the restaurant. Corporate got back to me and are sending me three drink coupons. They said that the franchise owner would be in touch and that they will be paying special attention to that restaurant. The manager was not very helpful and frankly, I don't think she cared all that much. For now, however, I am waiting for the franchise owner to contact me and hopefully it happens soon.\n\nThat's my update. I know it's not what a lot of you were hoping for but this is all I have going so far. If I don't hear from the franchise owner in the next week, I will contact corporate again to ask them why I was never contacted.",

We thought about going to the old address to check with whoever the tenants were, but it’s a gated property of a load of apartments and I don’t remember the code after all these years,  plus they may have changed it anyway. \n\nSo we ring up the company on the off chance that they’ve had it sent back to them, but it turns up nothing.

And all quotes are paraphrased a little bit because I don't remember exactly what they said.\n\nCL: Crazy lady\n\nMe and my family walk into a fast food restaurant known for its possession of the meats. This lady with a \"golden double-arches restaurant\" hat/visor is at the counter. She asks for her sandwich and fries to be bagged separately.\n\nApparently there was some confusion because the cashier didn't hear what CL said at first, and CL explains quite a bit louder how she wants them bagged separately, and \"It's not that hard to understand\".\n\nCL makes another sarcastic remark, and the cashier says \"You don't have to talk to me that way\", and this gets CL fired up. She starts telling the cashier \"You can't tell me to shut up\", \"Y'all on the east side (of our city) are so stuck-up\", and a few other things. She's giving a lot of the employees crap.\n\nCL even turns to me and my family and says something like \"Sorry about this, it shouldn't take this long to get things bagged separately, etc.\" No reaction from us. Me and my older brother are really trying to hide grins at this point.\n\nEventually CL tells the employees that she's gonna video the whole thing on her phone. Fine by the employees. So we're going to get our drinks and she's chattering away to her phone. We find a seat and sit down, and this lady starts going off again. There's about ten other people at the restaurant at this point, and one guy walks up to her as he's leaving and tells her something along the lines of \"You need to leave now.\" He rings the \"great service\" bell on the way out, *hard.*\n\nAt this point she's been here for twenty minutes, has her food, and has been told off by customers. So the employees get a little fired up back at her. They're slamming the fry baskets in the back and raising their voices a bit too. CL starts almost yelling about how they're racist, they made her miss her bus (she didn't seem in that much a hurry by the fact that she stayed and argued for so long), etc.\n\nOn the road outside, there was a minor car accident and a few police officers. My mom is looking out the window, deciding whether she should go out there and get one or two of them. But another customer beats her to it, and calls the police instead. CL is already threatening to call anyway. After a few minutes, the police come, they talk to her and the employees, CL is talking about how the cashier was threatening to punch her in the face (totally not true) and other things of that manner. The police escort her outside. She waits for a few minutes, gets put into the police car, and they drive away.\n\nMy grandma is a little disgruntled, me and my brothers are laughing, and my mom is shaking her head. My grandma was pretty vocal to us during the whole thing about how ridiculous this was, and she wanted to thank the employees. So she starts clapping, and so do the other 7 people in the restaurant (as I'm writing this sentence I realize how /r/ThatHappened it sounds lol). The manager comes out and tells us she's really sorry we had to hear all that drama. She was super chill about it, and we rang the service bell a bunch on our way out.\n\nNot the most exciting thing but it's the first time I've ever seen something like that happen!\n\n**TL;DR crazy customer comes in, wants her food bagged separately, flips out over a minor confusion, and gets removed by the police. And then all 7 of us applauded lol**",

        "text": "Of course I've had mediocre or slightly annoying customer service experiences in my life, but I've never really been upset about one. I've never asked for a manager or complained about anything. I worked retail/food for a long time, and honestly I don't expect much. As long as people don't go out of their way to be rude to me I generally like them.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever had a truly bad experience anywhere. \n\nSo I'm naturally blonde, but I've been dyeing my hair various dark colors for years. Sometimes professionally, sometimes box dyes, sometimes professional color but at home.\n\nI decided I'm tired of touching up my roots and I wanted to get close enough to my natural color that I didn't have to do that anymore. I knew the risks I was taking - bleaching 3 years of black and burgundy dyes out of hair is no simple task. But I'm pretty low maintenance about my hair and I figured worst case scenario I could just cut it all off - although of course I'm trying to do it responsibly if possible.\n\nI did a color remover and then a first bleach yesterday, which of course got me to this ugly orangey color, which I expected. After I did a protein treatment and then went to work today with brassy hair. Figured it was nbd, I know it looks bad but in the long run I know I'd regret overprocessing it in one go more, so I've just been walking around with ugly hair all day. Giving it a while to recover before I do a bleach bath and then tone the fuck out of it. \n\nI wanted a couple more masque treatments and a lower volume developer for the remainder of this blonde hair journey, so I stopped into the beauty supply store after work today. While I was browsing, an employee asked if I needed anything and I said nah I'm good, and she gestured to my hair and said \"so what are we trying to do here exactly.\" I laughed and told her the story, didn't take offense, I don't expect to be lied to and I knew what I was getting into.\n\nShe took the products I was looking at *out of my hands* and told me *no* like I'm a child. She told me my \"first mistake\" was box dyeing which like, yeah obviously that's what everyone says but I just didn't care at the time. I wasn't tripping about my shitty hair, it's not like I walked in crying over it and I told her it was a work in progress anyway. She put the products back on the shelf and then led me over to the purple shampoos, and gave me one and told me to just use that for a month instead. I told her I already have purple shampoo and I intend to use it and *also* tone my hair.\n\n\"When were you planning on trying to tone it?\" she asked.\n\n\"This weekend probably, if it feels healthy enough.\"\n\n\"NO. No chemicals for the rest of the year.  This is just what you have to live with when you box dye, next time go to a professional.\"\n\nWhat? Like really what? I didn't ask for her advice. I specifically told her I was fine and didn't need help, even. I get that my hair is bad, I get that she disagreed with my choices, but I didn't ask. This is a retail chain, not a salon. My best friend worked at one of these stores when we she was in high school, so although this lady might be an expert I have no reason to expect or trust that a random clerk is. It seems like a huge leap for her to take products from me and tell me what to do unsolicited, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nI ended up buying both the products she recommended AND the products I wanted because I was so caught off guard and I didn't want to be confrontational, and now I feel like an idiot for it but whatever I guess I have some expensive purple shampoo now.",

        "text": "Mandatory LTL; FTP\n\nThis will be extremely long, so I'm not sure if many people will read it; but I hope this story helps someone be more vigilant about checking their bills for unusual charges.\n\n\nFor background: My mother has been a loyal customer of BI&amp;T for over the past twenty years and besides some bills that were late being paid, she has been the model customer. No major problems besides the one that we are currently experiencing.\n\n\nThree years ago in 2014, I entered a long-distance relationship with my now ex-boyfriend. This will be the catalyst, so to speak, of our current situation so it is extremely relevant. After several months of dating, we decided that I should go visit him in his country (I am from the US, he is from the NL). My parents drove me to the airport, kissed me goodbye, told me to be safe, and I was on my way.\n\n\nWhen I landed in Amsterdam, I was extremely confused about trains as I had never dealt with a train system before--being from a moderately small town will do that to you. Not even thinking, I pulled out my phone and checked the train times; I was in constant communication with the Ex via WhatsApp.\n\n\nMy mom texted me the next day telling me not to use my phone anymore. One of the workers of the local branch had called my mom after an influx of data usage--over 20gb total in just one day of being gone due to the international usage. She and my mom talked over the situation and due to us being uninformed, they decided to waive the extra charges from my international usage and signed us up for the International Add-on for while I was there.\n\n\nHey, unlimited texting and free calls after 6 in the evening. Seems like a sweet deal, right?\n\n\nAfter I got back, my mom called to cancel the IAO and we thought all was well.\n\n\nThe next year, I am going back and knowing better this time, my mom calls and adds the plan back on. I go and come back, plan is cancelled, all is well.\n\n\nUntil just before Thanksgiving.\n\n\nMy phone had been giving me grief lately--not only had I broken the camera, but the battery was so completely shot that it was dying at 80% battery life while browsing the internet; it was a mess. Luckily, my mom has the insurance plan through them so I was able to make an insurance claim over my phone.\n\n\nWhile I was being helped out, the incredibly nice guy that was helping me (from here on out, called NG for Nice Guy) asked me if my mom were abroad. I was confused and hesitantly answered, \"No? Why?\"\n\nHe showed me the iPad he was working from and pointed out the fact that my mom had the international plan. At that moment, I freaked out because I had already come to the worst possibly conclusion--that they had never cancelled it in the first place... from two years ago. He went back the previous billing cycle and saw that it was on that one as well.\n\nHe told me to tell my mom and get her to call about it--that maybe someone could do something for us, maybe they couldn't; we would just have to try.\n\n\nA large part of me wishes that I had never told my mom about it, so that we could avoid her stressing herself out over this situation as she already has enough stress on her agenda.\n\n\nI tell my mom as I am leaving for work and rightfully, she is very upset. While she is on the line, she gets the famous circle-jerk of being transferred from one person to the other. She finally makes it to an apparent Supervisor (SV) of BI&amp;T, and she looks at my mom's previous bills--the IAO was on every single phone plan from July of 2015 to November of this year, 2017!\n\nSV is at first sympathetic and offers my mom a $200 credit--a $200 credit on what adds up to over $1,500 of being charged for a service that I used all of two months.\n\n\nMy mom was initially going to agree to that--after all, it's something. Was she happy about it? No. Was she still angry? Oh, yeah.\n\n\nShe is placed on hold once more, and after the SV comes back, she decides to revoke the initial offer of the $200 dollars. She said they checked the call logs and said that there is \"no record\" of my mom calling to cancel the policy. My mom is an equal combination of furious and upset over the insinuation that she's a liar and quickly hangs up on SV.\n\n\nShe calls again and talks to a lady that is horrified over how the situation has played out. Unlike the SV, she offers to file a claim under the loyalty program--reimbursement up to the full amount of $1,560 my mom was charged over two years. Nice Lady pointed out that as it was the holidays, that no one would probably look at it until the next week; our current week.\n\n\nSo here we are now, still waiting to hear about the claim she made on my mother's behalf.\n\n\nI feel incredibly guilty over this situation as I feel that if I had never gone to visit Ex, I would have never had to have that IAO for my phone.\n\n\nA larger part of me is furious however.\n\n\nYou see, the IAO had been on there from July of 2015. The next year when I was going back, my mom called and requested to have it added on again. The person to whom she was speaking never mentioned that we already had it, that it was already on the line. One of my brothers and I, as well as my mom, had been in the store numerous times over these past two years to upgrade our phones or make inquiries. Not a single person had bothered to mention anything about IAO.\n\n\nNot only that, but when NG pointed out the plan to me, it was on my mom's line--not mine. So not only had we been charged for it for two years, it was not even on the correct line that she had requested.\n\n\nIf it weren't for NG, we most likely still would not know about it and still be paying for a plan that I used for two months.\n\n\nMy mom had been a loyal customer for over 20 years. She liked BI&amp;T--she still does, but she feels like she has no choice but to switch phone companies now; as she feels like she can no longer trust them.\n\n\nI'm going abroad for school next semester, and I'm sure as hell not using their IAO. I'll do what a lot of my schoolmates are doing and buy a cheap pay phone to use while I am there.\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\ntl;dr: phone company royally fucked over my mom for over fifteen hundred dollars and supervisor is saying it's her fault. Waiting to hear back about a claim through the loyalty program made by another employee but not hopeful about it. Most likely going to switch phone companies after current contract is over.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo",

I’m patiently waiting to be checked for strep throat. \n\nAnyways, I walk in and go to the front desk to get started. I’m really familiar with the place because I get sick a lot, and I know the people who work there. However, the guys working here today, I’ve never seen them before. None of them are in uniform or scrubs or anything. Weird, but not unusual for the town I’m from. \n\nI go up to the desk and give him my ID and insurance card while he hands me papers to fill out. All standard procedure, whatever. He hands back my cards after scanning them and says, “you said you’ve been here before?” And I smiled and said “yeah, I have, a few times” and he said “okay, go ahead and take a seat”. I smiled and said thanks, beginning to put my cards back into my wallet. \n\nAfter I get my drivers license into my purse, literally not even 30 seconds after I said thanks, he goes “you can take a seat now”. Umm... okay. I just repeat “okay, thanks” and give him a concerned look but still smile. Maybe he forgot he already told me?.. \n\nBy this time I’ve gotten my second card back into my wallet, and am zipping it up to place back into my purse. A THIRD TIME, with a lovely impatient wave of his hand towards the seats “take a seat now”. \n\nSo I smile and say “I know. I’m putting my stuff back into my purse. The stuff you had to scan and handed back to me not even a minute ago. I’ll take a seat when I’m done packing my things up. Thanks.”\n\nHe just nods and sits there and watches me place my wallet into my purse, as if I’m moving as slowly as fucking possible. \n\nSo now I’m sitting in the waiting room and taking out my anger by eating all of their snacks. Now he’ll learn his lesson. \n\nAlmost wishing I had just left it at the counter and been like “Okay, since you’re so impatient, I’ll just leave it here. No problem”. And gone to sit down lol. ",

The food was really good even though a couple of times I had to wait over an hour for the food for whatever reason (no idea why considering they literally had 5 items on their menu: pho and a couple different banh mis).\n\nAnyways, one night I was sick with a fever of about 104 and all I could really eat was soup. So I ordered myself some pho from this place, realizing it might be a while since they were known to take long.\n\nI gave them about an hour and a half before calling on the status of my food. The guy puts me on hold for a minute to check.\n\n\"Sorry, we're super busy, the food should be there in about 20 minutes.\"\n\nOk, fine. After another 40 minutes, the food is still not there so I call again.\n\n\"I'm so sorry we're really backed up, your food just left and will be there any minute.\n\nAnother 30 minutes pass as I am practically dying from whatever virus I had and it's nearly midnight. So I call again, barely able to speak anymore and feeling like total shit.\n\nMe: Hey, I've called 3 times now and it's been nearly 3 hours and my food still is not here. When can I expect it?\n\nPhone Guy (PG): Uh... what did you say your address was?\n\nMe: blah blah st.\n\nPG: Oh uh... yeah I don't have any delivery here for you.\n\nMe: What are you talking about? You told me twice that my food was on its way. And I have my confirmation email.\n\nPG: Um... yeah sorry. I don't have any order from you.\n\nMe: So you lied to me the last two times I called because you didn't actually check if you had my order? Did you not even look for my order?\n\nPG: Um... sorry, it's my first day. (uh yeah, ok, that's literally the oldest excuse in the restaurant playbook)\n\nMe: Can I get my order delivered right now?\n\nPG: Sorry, we're closed.\n\nMe: Can I speak to the manager, please.\n\nPG: He went home already.\n\nMe: Oh, so I guess they're leaving the new guy to close up the shop on his first day all by himself?\n\nPG: ... Sorry...\n\nAnd so I went to sleep feeling miserable and hungry. Never ordered from there again. Still fills me with rage just thinking about it.",

        "text": "To start, I've been a loyal customer to the Brazilian rainforest for 10 years and a subscriber to their premium service for 7 years.  Every encounter with customer service that I've had has been pretty good.  They're usually quick to fix any issues that I had.\n\nApparently, they decided they no longer care about their customers.\n\nOn Black Friday, I saw the Nest thermostat was discounted $50 down to $200.  Combine that with the $100 rebate that my electric provider and it seemed like a pretty good deal, so I jumped on it.\n\nTwo days later (the day before Cyber Monday), the price dropped even further to $169.  Immediately, I contacted customer support asking if they could credit me the difference to avoid purchasing it again and returning the other one.  The customer service representative was very helpful and informed me that I would receive a $30 credit within the hour.\n\nFast forward to today (Thursday), I still did not have any credit on my account.  So I contact support again, explaining the issue and asking about the credit.  \n\n&gt; 07:11 AM PST Rep: How much was the refund promised?\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:12 AM PST DarthCthulhu: It was around $30\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:12 AM PST Rep: Could you please stay connected for two minutes while I research this for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:12 AM PST DarthCthulhu: Yes\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:17 AM PST Rep: Have you re ordered the item?\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:17 AM PST DarthCthulhu: No, I just wanted a credit for the difference in price\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:18 AM PST Rep: I'm sorry. The previous rep has provided you with the incorrect information. You'll need to return the item and re order at a lower price. \n&gt; \n&gt; 07:19 AM PST DarthCthulhu: Well I've already installed it and the item is no longer available at $169. If the rep had told me that information at the time I could have ordered it at the cheaper price\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:19 AM PST Rep: I agree with you here , however , I'm bounded by the policy , otherwise I would have loved to issue price difference.\n&gt; I hope you abide by the policy and understand my limitation.\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:20 AM PST DarthCthulhu: I understand. Is there a manger I can speak to instead who will be able to help me with this issue?\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:21 AM PST Rep: Even they have the same resources and will give you the same resolution. \n&gt; \n&gt; 07:23 AM PST Rep: I don't mean to rush you, but we've been idle for 1 minute. I want to make sure our chat's still connected. If you aren't able to respond in 1 minute, this chat will close.\n&gt; \n&gt; 07:23 AM PST DarthCthulhu: So because the previous employee gave me false information, I'm just out of luck\n&gt; Alright that's fine, I'll just cancel my prime and shop with Walmart from now on. Thanks.\n\nImmediately on providing negative feedback, it gave me the chance to send them an e-mail, to which I sent this:\n\n&gt;Per my previous two chats with your company, I was promised a credit in the amount of $30.  Your second rep told me I will not be getting that credit.  I have gone ahead and cancelled my Prime membership and will be conducting my business with Walmart from now on. \n\n&gt;If your company is willing to honor their word and credit me what was promised, I would be happy to continue my business with your company. \n\n&gt;As a customer for 10 years, this is the first time I've ever encountered such terrible customer service to make me cancel my account.  I sincerely hope that you're not willing to lose a dedicated customer over this. \n\n\nAnd this was the reply that I just got back..\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand you're concerned about price of the item..\n&gt; \n&gt; After reviewing your previous correspondence with our customer service, I can confirm the information provided to you was correct. As my colleague mentioned, We work hard to find the best prices out there and make sure our prices are as low or lower – changing our prices instantly if we find a lower offer somewhere else. Therefore, we don’t offer post-purchase adjustments.\n&gt; \n&gt; To read more about our pricing, please visit our Help pages:\n&gt; \n&gt;  http://fuckourcustomers.com/help\n&gt; \n&gt; I realize this is frustrating; however we aren't able to offer any additional insight or action on this matter and any further inquiries regarding this issue won't receive a response.\n&gt; \n&gt; We appreciate your understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; FuckOurCustomers.com\n\n\nIn other words, \"Our employee messed up, but fuck you anyway.  Our $30 is more important than your continued customer loyalty\"\n\n\nI feel like I have to follow through and never shop there again.",

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago, but still irks me to the core. \n\n\n\nI head over to the only Carty Pity I know of in SF to purchase myself a birthday tiara, because dammit, I'm a princess and everyone needs to know. I just so happen to decide to head over there on one of the few rainy days we've had recently, so looking cute went out the window and I opted to wear some old jeans, tshirt, jacket, and hoodie (I'm like 100lbs. I have no protective fat on my body. I don't even think I'm technically mammal). Since I was only heading to this store and back home, I decided to go light and took only my keys, phone, and debit card for my purchase. \n\n\n\n\nReach my destination and hop of the bus to make a mad dash across the street since the light was changing and it started to rain a bit heavier at the moment. I walked in the store and stood at the entrance for a second to shake myself off. I look up and happen to make eye contact with the security guard. So being friendly me, I say hi and go about looking for my birthday tiara.\n\n\n\n\nThis store I'm in is a complete mess. Half the aisles aren't marked, others are cover with leftover Halloween merch, and there are a few pallets here and there of new merch. I'm in no rush as I figured I was going to be a min, and by the time I checked out, I'd have to wait for the bus for a bit. So I decided to walk around looking at stuff to kill time.\n\n\n\n\nAt no point during my entire time in the store did I do anything to give anyone just cause to accuse me of stealing. But as I was checking out what was left of the Halloween merch, I noticed the security guard by the door wasn't standing that far from me. At first I didn't think anything of it and made my way over to the aisle of party ware in different colors, but when I went down the birthday character aisle, he was there at the end staring me down. Yes I touched stuff. Yes I took stuff off the shelf to get a better look. But with the clothes I had on, there was no room for me to start a five finger discount selection. So when I finally got to the aisle where the birthday crowns were, I again saw him standing at the end. I selected my crown and then decided to make sure before I got proof and complained. I started to make my way to the register, but then quickly changed pace and walked towards the last aisle. And sure enough, Mr. Guard started to follow me to the register then changed directions right after I did.\n\n\n\n\nSo I was right. This guy was following me, a 105lb black girl who did nothing to give reasoning to be accused, being followed around the store by security, WHO WAS ALSO BLACK!!!!!!!!! I was pretty upset about that and made up my mind to complain when I got the chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat made everything even more crappy about this, once I got in line to pay and he went back to his post by the door, this meth head couple I've seen all over the city came in. These were the people he should have been watching because they always carry a huge backpack each along with 3-4 tote bags. I've seen them steal from Daiso before so I knew these were the kinda people he really should have been worried about, but instead he stood at his post by the door and didn't move.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen It became my turn to pay, I walked up to the register and said that I wasn't going to pay for my item unless a manager rang me up. I felt like shit because the poor girl who called me looked upset like I was about to get her in trouble. I mentioned that I had a complaint about something that happened in the store that wasn't her fault and just felt like the manager could handle it better. Manager come up, sweet looking mom type, and asks what's wrong. I tell her how the security guard followed me, an empty handed person, around the store and was very obvious about it, but ignored the couple who walked in with enough bags to take a month long hike around Europe. I even mentioned that I felt like it was for sure a race problem, because I saw him make eye contact and nod to everyone who came in, but when I came in, he instantly started to follow me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manager apologize and even mentioned it wasn't the first time someone complained about him doing that. But since he wasn't the store's employee, there wasn't much she could do about, She was sweet enough to give me a discount on my purchase (which I wasn't looking or asking for) and even let me snag a KitKat from the counter display as an apology birthday gift.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's 2017 and I'm sad that this still happens. This isn't the first time I've been followed around a store, or randomly stopped and asked to have my bag checked. I actually went to Ballsmart to do some grocery shopping on Monday and after I used self checkout to make my purchase, I stepped off to the side in clear view of everyone, put my items into my bags, and went to the bathroom. When I walked out, there was a heavy set male employee and a very tall security guard. I heard them say \"She went into the bathroom\" before I turned around realizing I left my phone on the sink. And sure enough, once I walked out, they were right behind me. I stopped, turned around, and looked them directly in the face and asked if they wanted to check my bags. Even before they could make a comment, I dropped my bags and emptied everything onto the floor and gave them my receipt.\n\n\n\n\n\nI get it. Its the holiday season and you don't want to lose all that revenue. But when you follow around someone like me who hasn't done anything, this make me think you're profiling me because I'm black and this makes me even more fearful for my life. ",

Apologized for the disconnects/holds and misinformation, and will be looking into whoever I interacted with... Really was not trying to get anyone fired but if there's repercussions for them, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I commend him for the fast response, wasn't expecting a call today!\n\nThanks all for the advice and support! I won't lose a receipt ever again...\n\n-\n\nI’m still livid about this whole ordeal so here I am lol\n\nTL;DR: tried to return things at Trash-Mart without receipt; employees argue they can't; I find out they were lying the whole time and dodging my calls. A ton of calls and 5 hours later, I still have $90~ of unwanted junk food piled up in my tiny college room. Guess it'll wait for another day...\n\n\nSome backstory: Today, I tried to return some non-perishable food items I bought 3 weeks ago. I’d lost the receipt, but looked online/called and confirmed that I could return for at least store credit, since it was within the return policy. I’m generally a non-assertive person, so this experience was overwhelming for me\n\nSo my friend and I go to the Trash-Mart I’d bought the food. It's kind of a lot, since it's $120 worth, and all the employees there are looking. As I'm asking about the return, the associate keeps saying \"ma'am, I hope you know we can’t donate it or re-shelf it, only throw it away”. I tell her, that's fine, I just want my money back (I’m a broke college kid whose club event fell through, sorry for the waste but I need the money), and ask if I can reprint my receipt. She hesitates, saying \"yes, but you can't return the item with a duplicate receipt\".\n\nHere’s where my suspicions began: why would the copy not work? Isn't it just proof that I purchased the items? I keep bugging her about why it would make a difference, and she states that \"it doesn't work that way\", and then adds that I can ONLY return 3 items max. I tell her I don’t recall either of these rules being online, and she argues that “it’s policy”. A lot of back-and-forth tension and I relent and just return 3 things for store credit ($22 out of $120, yay I guess!) and leave. I feel a little bad about the food waste, but I wouldn't have eaten it myself anyways. Meanwhile, my friend is reading on their website and sees that this supposed policy is nowhere to be found. Time to be That Customer™.\n\nCORPORATE CALL 1: I call the store’s national number about the situation, and the rep tells me that there is no such policy and I should talk to a manager about reprinting the receipt. I’m feeling a little better now about being dubious, so I go back and ask for the manager, mentioning I had spoken with corporate. An associate scoffs, \"well, all you’re going to hear is the exact same thing anyway, but fine...\" (um, alright?), and calls her on the radio. Woman with a vest approaches me, the employees glaring. I tell her exactly what the rep told me, but Vest Lady insists that there is NO way to pull up receipts, because the “system doesn’t keep record of that”.  The first associate repeats what she'd told me earlier, so I ask her about the 3-item policy. Tells me that it's a policy specific to their store, and that she \"can't do anything about it, I'm really sorry hun\". I can tell she just wants me to gtfo and stop arguing already\n\nMy friend and I leave, but I call again because I'm still pretty damn confused about what all just happened. First the associate said I could print the receipt but it wouldn't work, now her manager says I can't reprint at all? And the corporate rep telling me different things than the store rep? Hmm...\n\nCORPORATE CALL 2: I get a different rep who tells me that Vest Lady was only a lower level manager with little authority, and that I should have spoken with a \"salaried member\". She confirms that this specific store did have a 3-item policy, but that I should still be able to REPRINT receipts and return everything for store credit. She says, chuckling, \"Sometimes the workers are just... ‘misinformed’, but give us a call if you run into any more issues and we'll nudge them in the right direction\" (a threat? lol)\n\nSTORE CALL 1: I call the store to specifically ask for a \"salaried member\", and the associate on the phone puts me on hold. After a FEW minutes, I get \"B\" on the phone, who informs me that they CAN reprint it, they just need the date of the purchase and the last 4 digits of my card (FINALLY). B tells me she's looking into what she can do about the return when the phone suddenly disconnects. Umm...\n\nSTORE CALL 2: I re-call and get the same first associate, ask her to reconnect to B. She puts me on hold and I get no response for a whole 15 minutes. She picks up and tells me that they are still looking for B (but I had just spoken to her?), and I’m hold for another 10 minutes before a male voice (not B) picks up saying that he can help me instead. The voice sounds similar to the man who'd been snarky to me during refunds earlier. He asks why I want the receipt (why is this necessary?), and I tell him it’s for a return. I ask if he's a \"salaried member\", to which he pauses and replies \"... no\". I tell him to redirect me, and I hold for yet another 10. Disconnects on me AGAIN. I’m pretty sure the customer service and returns desk is the same, so the people I’m calling are probably the same ones who dealt with me in person. In cahoots\n\nSTORE CALL 3: Same lady. I wait on hold for 30 full minutes and then hang up, because there’s no way they’re not stalling on purpose at this point. I call corporate AGAIN (I know, I know-- I'm THAT customer) to see if they can contact upper management for me, like they did before.\n\nCORPORATE CALL 3: Another rep listens to my spiel, grumpily tells me that it's ultimately up to the salaried In-Store Manager, \"D\". Doesn't tell me anything else than to bug D.\n\nSTORE CALL 4: Same woman picks up, puts me on hold for 15 minutes. The line disconnects.\n\nSTORE CALL 5: Same woman. Sounds annoyed with me by now. I ask for \"salaried member of management\". She tells me she's putting me on hold, but I clearly hear the receiver CLICK immediately. Definitely not a coincidental disconnect.\n\nSTORE CALL 6: I tell her that I was hung up on, to which she replies that \"NO, it just disconnected, I didn't hang up on you\", oddly defensively. I ask SPECIFICALLY for B, am on hold for 10 minutes, when she finally informs me that B’s off shift and that D is out of town for the next two days (I had never brought up D). I ask her when B got off, and she wavers for a second, but tells me 5PM. I end the call. At this point, my friend and I are REALLY suspicious of the holds, since this hold \"coincidentally\" ended a few minutes after 5...\n\nCORPORATE CALL 4: Frustrated with the store, I tell the next rep about the phone issues AND the refund. From him I discover that every store has the capability of reprinting receipts, and that Vest Lady would’ve known FULLY WELL of this, and that basically she lied to my damn face. The store in question will be scrutinized. I end my final call of the day.\n\nIt sucked being the \"Can I speak to your manager\" type, feels grimy. But I had a gut feeling I was being taken advantage of out of employee laziness/bias. I'm pretty sure that those \"disconnects\" and \"holds\" were just the employees trying to buy time, and that they were trying to avoid getting in trouble. I get that it sucks working at Trash-Mart as a middle-aged person and the pay is bad, but I’m just a customer who wants their money back, it’s none of your business to push your moral agenda or give me attitude while you’re at it...\n\nOverall, a ton of incompetent, rude associates, and two great corporate representatives who (sort of) saved the day. I honestly have no idea how the chain of command works in this store. Also, being persistent and cynical pays off.\n\nEdit: wording",

We park, go in, eat and have a great time, come out and there’s a car parked horizontally right in back of our car. \nWe wait for about 15 minuets at least, SO says it almost looks intentional because there’s literally no rook at all for us to squeeze out. There’s a lot of parking so it just doesn’t make sense that this car is blocking us, and for so long. \n\nThen this guy pops his head out of one of the back doors to a restaurant next to the place we just came out of. He points to his car and very sarcastically points at us t ask if we need to get out. My SO puts his window down and asks if it’s the guys car, and the guy says yeah. SO asked why did he park in back of us knowing he’d block us? The dude says *”That’s my spot”*as in ,the unmarked spot we had Katie’s in, he had personally claimed for his car. You know. And costumers visiting other businesses are just supposed to know it’s his. \n\nSO sarcastically said back *Ohhh it’s yours! Well why didn’t you say so!”* The dude unblocks is so we can leave. \n\nI know it’s petty but I think next time we eat ramen there, we’ll work in the same spot. When he blocks us again, we’ll just call a tow truck to move him. When he has a fit, just tell him, *”Oh hey but it’ll be okay, because this is your spot right? And that’s why you blocked parking and traffic right? I’m sure the tow truck and parking enforcement will get it if you just tell them that this unmarked spot is actually yours.”*\n\n\nI dunno man. A lot of things bug me but I let them go because you never know what a person is going through. But ugh. The tone, his smug ass face, his pitch black tinted windows with his car so low to the ground idk how he even made it past the dip in the driveway to the parking lot. ",

        "text": "There is a fast food restaurant near the university my fiance and I go to and we occasionally go there because it is next to the gas station we fill up at before going home. Normally I just get tea and he gets black coffee but when we fill up our sticker cards we treat ourselves to a hot chocolate. We decided to get peppermint hot chocolates because it is Christmas and studying has been stressful.\n\nAnyway, we're in the Drive-Thru (DT) and we specify that we want hot chocolates. We get asked to move to the other window and it takes over 5 minutes to get us two hot chocolates which we both thought was way too long since it didn't seem busy (when you drive to the DT, you see inside the restaurant and there were maybe 3 people inside and we were the only car in the DT).\n\nWe take our drinks and go to the gas station to fill up before heading home. I stay in the car while my fiance does his thing at the pump. While I'm waiting, I decide to take a sip of my drink and thankfully it was a small one because it turned out to be a mocha. I quickly spit back my drink and got out of the car and told my fiance. Now you're probably wondering what the big deal is but I am allergic to coffee. Not caffeine but coffee. There's something in the oils in the beans that I am allergic to and I break out in hives and potentially fall into anaphylactic shock if I drink too much. Its a weird allergy but I always make sure that what I eat or drink is coffee-free and its easy to manage.\n\nMy fiance tells me to walk back to the restaurant and get my drink fixed and that he'll meet me there when he's done with the gas. I do so and ask the teenage boy at the till to remake it and I stress that it has to be hot chocolate because I am severely allergic to coffee. I think I said it 3-4 times to him and he said that it would be right out. I always exaggerate the severity a bit when explaining it to people because some of them think I'm just trying to get away with not liking coffee and I've even had people try to \"convert\" me to coffee.\n\nI've been waiting about 3-5mins when my fiance comes into the restaurant and there's a gaggle of teenage employees surrounding the till and laughing loudly. I ask after 10mins of waiting, \"How long does it take to make a hot chocolate?\" and one of the girls, word for word, said \"About a minute so chill\". I said that I had been waiting for 10mins and show them the time stamp on my receipt.\n\nOne of the girls goes to the back and brings me a now somewhat cold hot chocolate. She practically slams it down on the counter and gives me a very sarcastic \"Have a nice day\". I just wanted to go home and was going to take my drink and go but my fiance told me to taste it just in case. Before I could even taste it, the smell of espresso hits me and I bring my drink back.\n\nI stress to the staff that I am allergic to coffee and that I would like a hot chocolate. My fiance is annoyed that they have managed to screw it up twice already. The new drink comes out much more quickly and it is yet again a mocha. I just want to go so I ask if I could just have a tea or something instead. I was told that it wasn't possible. I asked to speak to a manager and was told very rudely that there was no manager on shift.\n\nAt this point my fiance and I left and I was feeling a bit dejected. I'd had a hard day and was looking forward to a hot chocolate. Even though I explained my allergy to them, the repeatedly gave me something that could make me seriously ill.\n\nWhat should I do? I'm thinking of contacting corporate at this point simply because I could not believe how rude and careless the staff there were.",

        "text": "About a month ago, my boyfriend and I got a Pit Bull puppy (I'll call her Sister) in a neighboring state, and we became Facebook friends with the man from whom we bought her.  The weekend before Thanksgiving he posted that three of the puppies in her litter were still for sale, so we decided to go back and get one of her brothers (I'll call him Brother), and we brought Sister along for the ride. Brother was about a 90 minute drive from where we live, so on our way to pick him up, we stopped to get supplies for him at the Mart for Pets, which was about halfway between our house and his house.\n\n(*Because I'm anticipating the possibility of this coming up, I want to stop for a moment and say that, yes, we purchased the puppies instead of adopting them.  I'm not going to get into an argument or debate over buying vs adopting, but if anyone is curious, I'll answer some basic questions in the comments regarding how this all came about and why we went this route.*)\n\nWhen we got to the register, the cashier (an older woman around 60 years old) asked if we knew about their \"Puppy Pack\" (or whatever it was called), which was basically a booklet that you could purchase for, like, $20 or so that contained something like $250 worth of coupons (I'm making up the numbers in this post, as I can't remember the exact amounts). I thanked the cashier for the offer and politely explained that we live about 45 minutes away from Mart for Pets, and were only there because it was on our way to get Brother, so I wouldn't have an opportunity to use the coupons. I then heard the cashier speak into the microphone clipped to her shirt and say, \"The customer said there is not a Mart for Pets near where she lives.\" \n\nI found this very odd, like Big Brother was watching, as the cashier was obviously talking to someone about me, and it seemed like whoever it was knew I had declined to buy the \"Puppy Pack\". I asked the cashier who she was talking to, and she said it was her manager.  \n\nThen, out of nowhere, literally one second later - ***POOF*** - the manager (mid 20's, female) appeared at the register, and asked me, in an overly cheery and slightly incredulous tone (*because, DUH, how could I decline such a great deal??? Certainly, I must have misunderstood*), \"So, I understand you're not interested in the 'Puppy Pack'? You know it's only $20, and you get $250 worth of coupons!\"\n\nMe, once again: \"Yes, the cashier already told me about it.  It's just that we live in [*Town 45 Minutes Away*], we're only here because we're on our way to get her brother in [*neighboring state*], so I don't think I'd have an opportunity to use the coupons, but thank you for letting me know.\" I was hoping that would be the end of it, because Sister was pretty much over being in the store, had started whining, pulling on the leash and just being an overall cranky puppy, so I really just wanted to pay and be on our way.  But, of course, I wouldn't be posting on Reddit if that was the end of it.\n\nThe cashier had only scanned and bagged a few of our items at that point, and the manager, completely ignoring what I had just said, started looking in the bags and leaning over to see what was on the conveyor belt, while at the same time saying, \"Ok, the crate is 5% off, that's $2.50, the bed is 20% off, that's $4.00, this set of bowls is 10% off, that's $3.00, that's $9.50 altogether,\" then turning to the cashier, asks \"Are the collars discounted?\"  Then she reached across the belt, grabbed one of the \"Puppy Packs\" off of the rack by the register and started flipping through it to see if there was a coupon for anything else that we were buying.  \n\nAt some point during the manager's inventory of our purchase, my boyfriend had taken Sister outside, as she was, understandably, bored and not keeping still or behaving particularly well. I was left standing there, with what I assume was a pretty exasperated look on my face, when the manager finally stops, looks up at me and says something along the lines of, \"I'm just seeing if buying the 'Puppy Pack' is worth it with the money you'll save today.\" \n\nI really don't know how I didn't lose it on her in that moment, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the fact that there were puppies involved with this whole situation, and no one (with the possible exception of psychopaths) can get truly angry around puppies. So instead of saying what I was really thinking, I repeated, a bit more sternly, \"Again, I appreciate it, but, really, I live 45 minutes away, I never shop here, we're only here now because this store is on our way to get her brother, and I'm just never going to use the coupons.\"\n\nI really hate being made to repeat myself, so thankfully she *finally* got it and went away.\n\nIn hindsight, it's likely that there was some metric that the store had to meet involving how many \"Puppy Packs\" they sold.  I'm generally very sympathetic to employees who have to deal with unrealistic corporate expectations of that sort.  I've occasionally experienced pushy sales people who are trying to make commission or reach a quota or whatever, but if I'm firm and make it clear that I'm never going to buy whatever it is they're trying to upsell, they generally give up after two attempts. \n\nThat being said, I've honestly never experienced an employee who was this unrelenting and, IMO, disrespectful. The manager heard me say that I wasn't interested, with a perfectly valid reason, at least three times (I'm pretty sure there was more to this whole interaction, but I can't remember every detail a week later), yet chose to ignore me and treat me like I was an idiot.  Yes, I understand what the \"Puppy Pack\" is.  Yes, I understand how it works. No, in order to understand its benefits, I don't need you to spend *at least* five minutes of my life, that I can never get back, adding up the amount I'll save today.\n\nFurthermore, from the start, she knew that we live 45 minutes away from the store.  She knew that we still had to drive another 45 minutes to pick up Brother, and then another hour and a half to get back home. She watched as Sister became increasingly impatient and unruly, and as my boyfriend had to take her outside. Not to mention it might have occurred to her that, you know, we were probably pretty excited to meet Brother and bring him home, and, given the circumstances, we were probably more interested in being on our way do to that ASAP than saving five or so dollars. But, *sigh*, no. Her being able to sell one more stupid \"Puppy Pack\" was obviously way more of a priority than what we, the customer, had going on that afternoon. \n\nCould anyone explain to me how people still think that this type of railroading over what the customer wants is a good sales tactic?\n\n",

        "text": "So I just overreacted a lot. I went to a large chain store to get a photo printed at their photo lab. I’m a theatre major, and I needed a headshot printed. My headshot was taken 3 years ago by my friends dad who likes to take pictures for fun, so it’s definitely not professional. \n\nSo I get to go pick up the photo, and I’ve done this at this particular store probably 3 times in the past year, so I had it down pat. I figured I’d be in and out in 5 minutes, and I had a meeting with a professor to get to in the next half hour.\n\nWell the guy at the photo center, who I’d seen before, tells me I need a copyright release for my photo. I have a meeting in 30 minutes, I’d had this exact photo printed at this exact store a month ago and never had to deal with this, and I was just very frustrated. I told the man that I didn’t have a release and didn’t need one. I had no way of getting in contact with my friend’s dad at that second, but I definitely had the right to print it. \n\nHe tells me he needs a second opinion. The whole time he’s lecturing me on the importance of copyright, and I’m just getting irrationally angry. Finally his manager comes over after 10-15 minutes and approves the photo.\n\nFine. Great. Then, I run my debit card in the machine. It says, “approved”. The guy tells me it didn’t go through. That’s confusing, it said approved. He insists that I swipe again. So I do. Then, I pull up my bank app to double check, and guess what? I’m charged twice. \n\nI tell him, he says I’ll have to go to customer service to get a refund, and I’m pissed. This 5 minute process took 20 minutes, and now I’m late to meet my professor AND I was charged twice. And this guy had that calm, condescending demeanor that really grinds my gears. So I storm out like a petulant child and knock a bunch of shirts off the display as he calls after me that I forgot my receipt for the refund. \n\nThen he yells, “You accidentally knocked something over, you may want to clean it up.” As I stork out of the store. \n\nYes. I was immature. From his point of view, I’m a fucking nightmare customer. I’ve never been rude to retail workers before, I just snapped. Now I’m crying in my car because I missed my meeting with my professor, and I’m just really upset with how I handled the situation.\n\nEverybody has bad days. ",

        "text": "My wife and I got our Christmas tree up and decorated today and it reminded me of this story and thought you guys might appreciate it.  \n\nThe city we went to on our honeymoon almost a decade ago had an aquarium.  We went to it, enjoyed it, and of course had to exit through the gift shop.  We try to get Christmas ornaments from places we visit to bring up memories when we decorate the tree.  My wife loves seahorses and they had a beautiful glass seahorse so we bought that.    \n\nFast forward two or three years.  It was Christmastime and the tree had been up for a couple days.  We came out to the living room one morning and there was our tree on the floor, having tipped over while we were sleeping.  We got to work picking it up and surveying the damage when my wife just started crying.  I rushed over and asked what was wrong and she pointed to our seahorse shattered on the floor.  I was bummed but she was really upset about it.  I decided to try to do something about it.  \n\nI emailed the aquarium explaining what happened and asked if they somehow by some miracle had the same ornament even though it was years later.  I said I'd be willing to pay for it and shipping if they could send it to me.  They didn't have an online store so I wasn't sure if this was possible.  A lady emailed back and said that they didn't have any more but had asked nearby aquariums to see if they had any.  I was already blown away by her going above and beyond.  A couple more email exchanges and she said she wasn't able to locate the exact one that was broken but she sent a picture of the 4 seahorse ornaments that they did have.  I told her which I wanted and asked what the best way to pay was.  I still have her email, which is as follows:  \n\n\"I am glad you could find one that you were happy with.

        "text": "I'm fairly new to this sub, so hopefully I'm doing this right... \n\nME = Me\n\nSW = Store worker\n\nSM = Store manager\n\nSo two days ago my wife found a scooter online that we had wanted to get for our 2 year old for Christmas. The only problem was that it was collection only, and only in stock at a store about an hour drive away. I know this may not be far for some, but in quaint little England this is a long way! \n\n\"No problem\", I think, \"he really wants it so we'll make the effort to go out there.\" \n\nSo yesterday morning, we get two texts almost simultaneously as follows:\n\n\"Your item is now ready for collection\" \n\n\"We're sorry but the item you ordered is out of stock and will not be available for collection.\" \n\nA little confusing. So I did what any sensible person would do - called the store to check:\n\nME: \"Hi we had ordered an item for collection, but then had a couple of contradictory texts about it.\" \n\n[Bit of back and forth to explain the specifics] \n\nSW: \"Oh I'm sorry about that. I tell you what - I'll nip into the back now and check if it's there, then you will know for sure either way.\" \n\nME: \"Great thanks.\" \n\n[Hold music.... a brief wait....] \n\nSW: \"Hi thanks for holding, I've checked the back and confirmed that your package is there, so you can come in and collect it!\" \n\nME: \"Thanks a lot, we'll see you soon then!\" \n\nSo fast forward a bit and we arrive at the store. I agree with my wife that she'll go collect the scooter, and I'll distract my son by taking him to look at other toys in the store. \n\nAbout 10 mins later my wife comes to find me and tells me that they don't have the scooter, and have told her that she shouldn't have driven all the way here as they did send a text to say it wasn't in stock. \n\nShe points out the lady that had told her this, and so I tell her to watch our son while I go to talk to them about it. \n\nConversation ensued as follows:\n\nME: \"Hi I think you were the one who spoke to my wife about the scooter that isn't in stock?\" \n\nSM: \"Yeah so?\" \n\nME: \"Could you get a manager for me please?\" [obviously not realising at this point that she is a manager] \n\nSM: \"I'm a manager.\" \n\nME: \"OK.... [a little stunned as she didn't exactly come across as managerial]....well as I'm sure my wife explained, we've driven an hour to get here, on the basis that one if your staff specifically told us the  scooter was in stock\" \n\nSM: \"Well I don't know what to tell you, the scooter isn't here so I can't give it to you.\" \n\nME: \"I understand that it's not here, but that doesn't change the fact that you've made us drive all the way out here for nothing.\" \n\nSM: \"Well I don't honestly see what we did wrong.\" \n\nBear in mind I'm still trying hard to not be \"that asshole customer\" throughout, but I'm also getting pretty pissed off at how the conversation is going. \n\nME: \"So to recap... we called up to ask if the scooter was in. One of your staff went to check if it was there. They told us it was there. We come in. It's not there.\" \n\nSM: [Silence] \n\nME: \"There's nothing wrong with any of that?\" \n\nSM: [More awkward silence] \n\nME: \"I understand that if it's not here you can't give it to us. But honestly I expected you to offer some kind of compensation to us.\" \n\nAs an aside... I *HATE* asking for compensation anywhere. It always feels like I'm trying to cheat a business out of something even though I'm not. This situation had pissed me off enough that I felt it was warranted though. \n\nSM: \"Well I can't just go giving compensation to every customer who comes in can I?\" \n\nME: \"Do you tell every customer who calls up that something is in stock when it's not?\" \n\nSM: [Again with the awkward silence...] \n\nSM: \"Well I suppose I could give you 10% off another scooter...\" \n\nME: \"Wait a minute... The one we were supposed to get was £60 reduced down to £35 (hence why we drove that far to get it). That's a lot more than 10%.\" \n\nAnyway, there was some more back and forth after this, and eventually she agreed to give us a similar scooter (which hadn't been reduced) for the same price as the one we would have got. \n\nSo the eventual outcome was good, but I'm just annoyed that I had to fight to get it. \n\nI've been on both sides of the retail fence, and I understand that some customers really do just try and get as much as they can for free by complaining, but when someone has a genuine grievance caused by the store's actions, shouldn't a good manager be bending over backwards to rectify that? Or am I expecting too much? ",

        "text": "Last night I took my daughters shopping late at night for Black Friday. It was fun and exciting and more for the adventure than the deals. We barely bought anything, just a few good deals. \nWe get hungry around midnight or so and pop into an all night burger joint. \nBoy were they packed! \nWe waited for a table to clear and it took a long time for everything but that wasn’t my issue. My issue was with the manager/waiter with the horrible attitude. \nMy waitress was amazing. She was clearing tables, taking orders, kicking butt with a smile. I loved her! \nHowever the supposed manager who was waiting tables could not have been more sour faced. I overheard her say they were short staffed, didn’t have enough dishes, she talked down to the younger customers,  was passive aggressive and frowned the whole time. Overall she was unprofessional. She got a little food on her hand from a customers food and went “eww gross!”  (I over heard her customers being like ‘geesh. What’s her deal?’) I almost wanted to be like “we get it, you’re frustrated and you don’t want to be here but treating your customers like this and being rude isn’t necessary. It’s not our fault you aren’t full staffed” but I didn’t. \nI just enjoyed my kids and ate my food. It was good! And cheap. Like $12 for all us! \nSo I go up to pay and witnessed rude girl arguing with another manager and a chef. Finally the other manager goes “this lady needs checked out. Go help her” \nI smiled and she came up and muttered something under her breath but I def heard the f word and such. I just ignored her. \nWell, since my waitress was the bomb I gave her a $10 tip on my $12 food. The rude girl said “did you MEAN to leave $10 tip?” I said yes and smiled and she looked at me like I was nuts. Then rolled her eyes. \nI wanted to be like “you might get better tips if you weren’t so awful!” \nI finished my transaction and got my Kids and left. \nI have a strong feeling this gals tips weren’t too great and I hope my waitress went home with a pocket full of tips. I know my $10 wasn’t anything amazing and I wish I had more to give but man was I thankful I didn’t get the rude gal! ",

        "text": "So atleast twice a month I go to a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. I love going and the staff is always top notch. I always give at least 15 percent tip to very bad service and I usually go much higher on tips because this restraunt has such an amazing staff. I also would like to notice I am a very nervous person who always assumes I'm in the wrong.\n\nWell a few months ago I got a server I had never seen before. (To let you guys know she always has a smile on her face) she seems friendly and begins to take our orders. I ordered a milk shake and my family ordered sodas. She took about 20 minutes to bring it to us. My family is usually very understanding and we understand that sometimes things happen only problem though there weren't many people eating there today.\n\nShe finally gets here and gives us our drinks my milk shake is obviously melted and the cherry is already halfway inside the cup. I decide not the best say anything. I then notice she didn't give me the extra shake. Usually when I order a milk shake in that restaurant they give me a cup with more milk shake because they have told me that the machine always makes to much of the shake and they see it as a waist if they just throw it away. I ask her if she still had the remaining milk shake. She immediately told me that she will have to charge me an additional milkshake of I wanted the extra that was left from the machine. I tell her nevermind I'll just drink this one.\n\nWe begin to order and I always order this plate where you can choose 4 food items. I begin to tell her my choices and she happily writes it down. When we are done ordering she walks away smiling but immediately when she begins to walk away her smile goes away and rolls her eyes. Another 40 minutes pass by and She finally comes back and passes us our food the food is cold.\n\nWe have missing food items and my mom begings to say she is missing her toast and pancakes. The waitress with a big smile on her face turns and says \"you did not ask for toast\" my mom says she is sorry and would like to order them and the pancakes. The waitress happily jolts it down and leaves. She comes back with the food and the check. I begin to look over and realize that she charged me an extra item for my plate and the she charged 2 orders of toast and pancakes.\n\nI begin to ask the waitress she may have made a mistake. She then tells me that the plate has always been 3 items not four, and that the receipt says it charged you twice for the pancakes and the toast but that the first two go with this plate. As she is saying this she is smiling really hard now and talking through her teeth. I get freaked out and my mom does to. My mom decides to just pay it and we get up and leave and we didn't pay a tip because she was acting weird and basically charged us 20 more dollars. Then what we were supposed to pay.\n\nUnfortunately for us we got her 3  more times with the same exact outcome. Except this time she would just charge us 10 more dollars. We finally get a different waitress and she begins to take my order I order the usual plate I always order.  I say the 3 items I would want in my plate when the waitress asks me what the fourth item was I then say ohh they are letting us get four items again. She begins to tell me that  plate ALWAYS had 4 items it never changed. She also brings my milkshake with the extra cup I then ask her I didn't want to be charged another milkshake and she then says oh no we always give this to our customers. Since we will have to throw it away anyways.\n\nSo I'm getting pissed because this girl has been charging us extra this whole time. I finally go up to the Manger and say this waitress named \"waitress name\" has been telling me lies. Charging me more I show the receipt all of them. Took then out and showed him all of them and compared it to the waitress that charged me today. He apologizes and says he calls her over. He asks her did you tell them this and that and she says what No that we are lying that we always ask for extra then change our minds last minute. Fourtnley for us most of the waiters knew us and one said \"wow that's wierd because everytime I have them they order almost the same thing\" the manager glares at her and says we will talk privately. He decideds not to charge us for the meal as a way to apologize and my mom and I were thrilled. \n\nAs I walk out she is giving me the evil. I end up going the next day to the restraunt and she ends up being our waitress we decide to get her we order the usual. We check the bill and she didn't charge us extra this time and since we were still mad and she still took forever to bring our food. This time she didn't charge us extra but we didn't leave a tip to her but to the waitress we had last time.\n\nThe last time I went to eat there I asked the waiter what happened to her and he told me she got fired and told me no one liked her.

        "text": "While waiting for my mom to finish Black Friday shopping, my dad and I decide to grab some food at the mall's food court. We settled on sharing a pizza at a build your own pizza place. I make my order, and take note of a number engraved in metal, 46, that was placed on my pizza before the pizza was placed in the oven. Afterwards I paid, gave my name, and waited for my order.\n\nHere's where things went wrong. I saw my pizza was ready, and approached the pickup counter. Let's call the worker at this counter PW (pickup worker). However, someone else's name, let's call her OC (other customer), was called out. I exclaimed that the pizza was actually my order and this conversation transpired:\n\nMe: Hey, I think the orders got mixed up. That's actually my order. Those are the ingredients I picked out.\nOC: No, that's my pizza. That's what I got.\nMe, towards PW: Well the metal number you just pulled out of the pizza was 46, right? That's the number my pizza was assigned.\nOC: No, that was the number for my pizza.\nPW: Maybe two of those numbers exist. *proceeds to give OC my order*\n\nI didn't want to make a scene, so I let it slide. I noticed there was a pizza set to the side. I checked it out, and there was an order slip on top, the ones workers use as reference in most fast food places. The number on the slip was 97, while the number on my receipt was 99. After 10 minutes, the order had been called out a few times, but no one claimed it. I tried to talk to PW about it. \n\nMe: Maybe the pizza that no one is claiming belonged to the person you gave my order to?\nPW: No.\nMe: Well where's my pizza? I've been standing here for a while and people who have ordered after me have gotten theirs already.\nPW: Let me see your receipt.\n\nI do as asked, and hand over my receipt. The problem with these receipts is that the customized ingredients are not listed. The only information given is the type of crust that was ordered. The conversation continued as follows:\n\nMe: *opens the pizza box* Look, this is the other type of crust that costs an extra dollar. I only ordered a regular crust.\nPW: *Looks at the pizza, then looks back at the receipt*\nMe: On top of that, I didn't ask for olives. There are olives on this pizza.\nPW: Well this is your order.\nMe: No it isn't. You called out number 97. My order number is 99.\nPW: No, the order number for this pizza is 99. *hands me an order slip and my receipt*\n\nI'm pretty sure she switched the slips on me, because I'm 100% sure the order number on the slip was 97 when the pizza was left out. At this point, I was just tired of PW's bs and just took the pizza. In retrospect, I should have asked for the manager. In the end, I just filed a complaint to the company. Giving away my order is something I can let slide, but forcing me to take the wrong order instead of letting me get a new pizza is what got to me.\n\nLong rant, but I really needed to get that out.

I retreated quickly but quietly to the first quiet isolated place I could find, zipped up my jacket, threw the hood on, and rocked back and forth to calm down.\n\nA short time later, a nurse found me and she was damn near in tears because she thought the food thing upset me so much that I broke down.

The guy at Bad Guys assures me the modem is going to work so I buy it, whole $200 which is a lot for me. \n\nIt. does. not. work. Well, I get internet, but constant dropping out, constant streaming problems, low speeds, all in all, its a shitfest. Took me 4 hours to set it up even though it was supposed to do it automatically cause I got fiber. \n\nAnyway, as it was terrible and unusable, I called Bad Guys and told them about the problem and that I wanted a refund as it turned out I managed to get my hands on a modem from my provider that worked perfectly. They tell me other the phone that its all good, just bring it down and they will make the necessary. \n\nSo I go down to the store, and the cashier tells me to go to the tech section to do the refund.

Here's how it goes:\n\n&gt; SF: Hello can I help you? \n&gt;     \n&gt; M: Yes thank you, I called earlier about a refund on this modem.\n&gt;     \n&gt; SF: Ok, what's wrong with it?\n&gt;     \n&gt; M: Nothing, its still new, everything is in the box but it just is not compatible with my provider so I can't use it at all.\n&gt;     \n&gt; SF: Which provider are you?\n&gt;     \n&gt; M: xxnet\n&gt;     \n&gt; SF: Ok come with me.\n&gt; \n\nAnd then, instead of processing the refund, he spends 15 minutes on google looking where it said that xxnet was not compatible with g-link. 15 fucking minutes. \n\n&gt; SF: Who told you that this modem is not compatible with your provider?\n&gt;     \n&gt; M: I tried it, it took me 4 hours to set it up, it was a mess, and it's not working fine at all, drops, low speeds, constant time outs, and when I tried my provider's own modem, it works fine. I looked up the problems and found that other people had the same problem with that provider and that modem.\n\nSF looks at me like i have no idea what i'm talking about then proceeds to actually do the refund. Another 10 minutes go buy then he goes to the office and talks to his manager I think.\n\n&gt; SF: OK, so because it has been more than a week, we cannot do a return, we can only send it back to get fixed but as there is nothing wrong with it, there is nothing we can do for you.\n\n&gt; M: OK, but the thing is that you guys assured me that it was going to work fine with my provider, that's why I bought it. Also I called this very store before and explained the whole situation and that I was not able to come return it earlier and I was told by your colleague that the refund would be done.\n\n&gt; SF: OK let me talk to my manager.\n\nHe goes for yet another 10 minutes. \n\n&gt; SF: OK I spoke to my manager, and we do not usually do this but this time we will accept to do a swap. So choose another modem.\n\n&gt; M: A swap? I need a refund. That's what this whole thing has been about since the beginning.\n\n&gt; SF: *putting his smuggest look* listen, I told you that it's been too long, so it's either a swap or store credit. \n\nMe being non-confrontational agree to store credit, so he leads me to the cashier, with a receipt and this is what he tells her.\n\n&gt; SF: Do a refund for this then put the money on store credit.\n\n&gt; Cashier: Ok no worries.\n\nAs soon as he goes, without even acknowledging me, I ask the cashier:\n\n&gt; M: Hi, sorry, is it possible for me just to get the refund directly instead of store credit?\n\n&gt; Cashier: *turns to her manager who is actually standing right there and heard everything then nods* Of course you can, love\n\nSo I got my refund straight. I have no idea why the guy was bent on not helping me when his own boss had no problems. The boss he supposedly went to talk to and had to convince to accept my return. ",

        "text": "A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I went out to New York so I could run the Marathon. I was so excited, and even though I didn't hit my goal time, I wore my medal proudly all day the following Monday. It was our last day in town and we had a few hours to kill before we needed to head to Times Square for a taping of the Late Show so we found a well-priced diner style restaurant for breakfast.\n\nWe found a cozy spot near the window and the woman immediately greeted us with waters. She noticed my medal and asked how the race was, told me congratulations, asked where we were from, etc. I wasn't sure if wearing the medal would make me seem pretentious, but when else would I wear it? I was proud of finishing and it's one of the best races in the country. I was glad she was so friendly about it and made me feel better about my finishing time. Then they guy from the counter brought our meals out and again we had a lovely conversation about the marathon. It was clear that they have regulars but they were just as nice to us as they were to the people who came in all the time. \n\nSo at this point we're already really glad we came. The food was great, it was super well priced unlike most of the city, the staff was incredibly friendly, we felt really welcomed, and we were having a great time on our vacation. \n\nThen I go up to the counter to get our bill and pay for our meal. The guy waves me off and tells me it's on them. I was blown away. Yeah it was probably only $20, but it was just such a nice, unexpected, and very unnecessary gesture. It was one of our top restaurant experiences on the trip and whenever we're back in the city we'll clearly make it a point to stop back over.\n\n\n\n",

This is more of a rant about a fellow customer, but I assume it works. \nThe main instigator was the other family's father, who will be referred to as AD (angry dad). \n\nI was probably 12 at the time, and my family went out to eat with another family. We ate out with them pretty much every weekend. This weekend was *popular Italian food chain* night. It was busy, as it was a Saturday night, so service was slow. We ordered our food and waited. \n\nAfter fifteen minutes my step-dad started to grumble complaints about the slow service, which is normal for him, but it was a huge mistake. Him complaining started to rile up AD, who has anger management issues.The server came over with breadsticks and side salad. If you've ever been to *popular Italian food chain* you've probably seen their large salad bowls where you serve your own salad onto the plates. Oh no no no, according to AD, they're supposed to bring out the salads on separate plates.\n\nThis was just the last straw for AD. He called over the server and started complaining about the salad and slow service. The server went into the \"sorry about that, were really busy tonight\" mode. This just angered AD even more. He started yelling and slammed his hands against the table (he is a 6'2\" large man). Everyone else at the table wanted to die. The server apologizes again, in which AD takes the basket of breadsticks and throws it at him. \n\nReminder that I was twelve and the other family had a three year old daughter. \n\nI just start bawling, AD yells even louder, some random lady laughs, AD's wife starts yelling at her, and my mom just drags their daughter and me out of the building. I have no idea how that was resolved, but we ended up going to another place to eat. Not that I had an appetite. \n\nWe still haven't gone to *popular Italian food chain* since. ",

        "text": "First time posting here. This happened a few years ago, but I was reminded of it earlier and thought I'd share. This got long. Sorry. \n\nThe cell company I use started their \"Specific Phone Every Year\" plan and rolled it out by letting customers get the latest specific phone for $5/month. Having an older version, and seeing this as a good deal, I decided to get the newer phone. \n\nThat day, I go to an authorized retailer. It's the weekend and there's a huge line of people there who are trying to get their phones fixed. After waiting for 2 hours, I'm finally next in line. I tell the clerk what I'm there for, and he stops me short to tell me that they don't have any of the new specific phones. I'm annoyed at this because I just waited for two hours for this, but I understand. He tells me that they're getting a new shipment in the next day and that I can come back then and get the new phone.\n\nI nod and head out. When I get home I use my cell company's site to send a request to the retailer to hold the rose gold version of the phone for me for the next day. I receive confirmation that my phone will be there from the company in the form of an email that I'm told to print out. \n\nThe next day, I go back, wait again for an hour this time, and once again, when it's finally my turn, the clerk (a different one from yesterday) tells me that they have no new phones. At this point, I'm really frustrated. This store has literally only been open for 3 hours (2 when I first arrived) and these phones didn't drop like a few days ago. The phones came out late Sept 2015 and I was trying to get one mid Nov 2015. Furthermore, I had used the company site to reserve a phone. When I showed them my email, the guy told me that they received nothing from the company and that they don't hold phones. He said that I should speak to the company because someone there told me wrong. \n\nSince there was literally nothing he could do further, I left. I called a family member to vent about it, and she told me that I needed to call the company and tell them what their authorized retailer had told me. This is where it gets \"fun\" again. I'll be M, and the company rep I talked to will be CR.\n\n&gt;CR: Thanks for contacting Company. How can I assist you?\n\n&gt;M: I wanted to tell you about an issue I had at an authorized retailer. It's at address and state. \n\n&gt;CR: Okay, what seems to be the problem?\n\n&gt;M: Last night, I reserved New Phone at Authorized Retailer to be picked up today. However, when I went to Authorized Retailer, they told me that they had already sold their New Phone stock, that they never received any notification from Company about the reservation, and that they don't hold phones for people and Company told me incorrectly that they would. \n\n&gt;CR *condescendingly*: ...So you're upset that they don't have the phone you want to get right now because they're sold out?\n\nAt this point, I'm rather taken aback. I mean, yes, I'm upset that I can't get the phone, but it's not really about that. The convo continues...\n\n&gt;M: I mean, I'm frustrated that I did what I could do to reserve a phone and it wasn't there when Company said it would be, but Authorized Retailer represents Company and is telling Company customers that Company is wrong. \n\n&gt;CR: Okay. Have you gone to Authorized Retailer at the mall to check on their stock?\n\n&gt;M: I was actually getting ready to head over there...\n\n&gt;CR: Okay, so you can check with them and if they have the phone in stock and you can get it today, you'll be happy, right?\n\nAt that point, I was frustrated with the representative, told him yes, and got off the phone with him as quickly as possible. I went over to the mall to the Company kiosk and asked if they had any specific phones in rose gold in, and the guy looked at me strangely (because seriously, it seems ridiculous that any place would sell out) and said that they did. \n\nThis clerk wasn't at all familiar with Specific Phone Every Year plan from Company, so he then spent an hour on the phone with someone from Company getting all the details and being walked through how to ring me up. \n\nApparently he wasn't listening very well or the Company person on the phone with him was telling him the wrong thing because at the end, he's like, \"Okay, that'll be $10.\" $10 isn't a lot of money to complain about, but I wasn't supposed to be charged anything because, with the plan, you pay for the phone itself monthly, and it's part of the monthly phone bill. \n\nI explained this to the clerk, and he's muttering about the $10 being \"other charges\" and it'd already been a long day, so I paid it so I could just get the new phone and leave. \n\nI called Company when I got home and asked about the $10 \"other charges\". They said that there were no other charges, and when they looked at what the clerk put in, he'd made several mistakes and basically tried to set me up as a new customer with an entirely different plan than the one I had- hence the $10 charge. So, I spent another hour on the phone with Company getting the mistakes he'd made cleared up. At the end of it, this person refunded me the $10 and waived that month's bill for my troubles. \n\nIt all worked out in the end, but wow it was awful dealing with that. I'm a pretty non-confrontational person, so having to deal with so many mistakes was terrible. \n",

Since most of their meats were coated in a spicy sauce, I stuck with a plain bean and cheese burrito. One girl in particular, who always seemed to be working when I came in, began to recognize me as 'Bean burrito girl!' and would just instantly start making my burrito whenever she saw me come in. She always gave me an extra scoop of beans.\n\nWe would chat about what was going on in our lives - I learned she was studying to be a esthetician, that she loved cutting hair, and lots of various gossip about her co-workers. I'd stay and eat my burrito in the store if I had the time so we could talk. I nicknamed her the Queen of Burritos.\n\nOne day I came in to see a notice taped to the wall - the place would be closing down in a week. With barely any warning, the owner had decided to sell. Queen of Burritos was devastated. The job was close to her house, and she genuinely liked working there. In those last two weeks I came to the store as many times as I could, and every time, Queen of Burritos made sure to give me twice as much cheese and salsa.\n\nThe place is a trendy ramen shop now, bit whenever I pass it I think of the Queen of Burritos. I never learned her real name, but I hope she's out there cutting the finest hair, and still giving strangers an extra scoop of beans.",

So as I head back to checkout my husband is trying not to laugh. I ask him why he said \"I got a senior discount!\" Now my husband is only 40 but I guess because he has an epic beard (it's mostly red and has some gray in it) he got a senior discount. He said it the entire day \"my beard stays I get discounts!\" \n\nThese last 2 days at said department store were senior discount days...so I guess my husband now qualifies for a senior discount! He only paid $25 on his shoes that he wanted. They were originally $70. \n\n\nThe reason he paid if there's confusion his work rewards prepaid credit card is in his name and I can't sign for him. We share money it was easier for him to get it and tell him it's his Christmas present early. He's so hard to shop for we do this every year for the past 9 years we've been together. \n\n",

Based in Colorado (but that’s not really important). We’ll call her CL\n\nSo I had been in a huge, knock down drag out fight the night previous with my dad. Like screaming, threats, the whole nine yards. I also have a bit of a temper. In my frustration, I slammed my phone down on the kitchen floor-hard. The phone still worked, but the screen was just shattered and flaking glass everywhere. It wasn’t a good night. \nSo the next morning after I had calmed down a bit, I tried to do some damage control and headed to my local fruit stand at the mall. They told me that there wasn’t anything they could really do and that I should consider buying a new phone. Keep in mind that my parents won’t allow me to have a job so I have 0 disposable income for stuff like that. They also suggested that I try to call fruit support to see if they could help. So, disheartened, I went home and called. \n\nCL: Thank you for calling support, my name is CL, how may I help you?\nM: Hi there. I broke my phone screen on the ground. Is there anything you can do to help me?\nCL: Sure! Can you just give me your information? I’ll look up your account. \nSo I tell her my info. \nCL: Oh, you live in (city)? I went to college there!\nM: Yeah, I go to University of (city) too. I’m trying to become a mechanical engineer. \nCL: Really? That’s great! \nSo we talk a little bit, mostly about the university and the city, and she pulls up my account. \nCL: Ok, so it looks like you bought this phone recently, so here’s what I’m going to do. Fruit stand has an option to send the phone in for a replacement. All you have to do is either send the busted phone in for collateral or put a card on file. This won’t cost you anything. \nM: Are you serious???\nCL: Yep! I’m the (high up manager, it’s been a while so I can’t remember exactly what she said) so I can pretty much solve this how I want. Us MechEs gotta look out for each other, right?\nM: *almost crying* Thank you so much. I can’t even tell you what this means to me. \nCL: Not a problem!\nSo she sends me the information to get the process started, and in about 10 days I had a brand new phone!

Our taxes are paying for you to buy Nth items\" etc. Basically a cantankerous bitch that shouldn't be dealing with the public.\n\nI just grabbed my magazine, placed it on counter &amp; handed her my mobiles card to scan &amp; said \"£5 on that please\", to which she grabbed the card, did the deed, scanned my mag' &amp; said \"That'll be £52.40 please\" (Guessing on the £2.40 for the mag', was years ago hehe).\n\nMe: *\"You what!?\"*\n\nMG \"£50 for the mobile, £2.40 for your magazine, that adds up to...\"\n\nMe: \"I know what that adds up to, but why did you put £50 on the mobile, I said £5!\"\n\nThis went back &amp; forth a few times, along with me asking *\"When have I, or anyone, ever asked for £50 on their phone!?\"*\n\nShe demanded that I pay, I flat out refused as it was neither what I asked for nor wanted, so she started screwing about with the machine to fix her screw up, all the time still complaining to me about *\"my screw up\"*. In the mean time, I'm getting too close to when I should've been driving off to work...\n\nAt one point she phoned my provider, they told her it was her problem, not theirs. Again, asking me for the £50, I said no way in hell I was paying that &amp; that I had to be setting off to work in a few minutes &amp; I *would be going regardless*.\n\nShe *finally* phoned the owner, explaining what had gone on (again trying to blame me), when owner apparently told her it was her problem &amp; that she had to give me back my card so that I could leave &amp; that she was going to have to come in (day off apparently).\n\nCard got handed over, she scowled whilst mumbling \"You asked for £50...\", so I just grabbed my mag', paid £7.40 &amp; set off to my car.\n\nSaw owner quite some time later, she said she knew it wasn't my fault. Didn't see MG for quite some time after that, except once coming down from toy area in newsagents (basically upstairs where no one went often) many months later, guessing she'd been moved out of sight.\n\nHaving been in retail in some form for the last three years, whilst I would like to call out plenty of \"customers\", I wouldn't dream of pulling the kind of stunt that she tried.\n\nIn the end, I got £50 worth of credit for a phone I didn't use that often, so went nuts while that lasted :)",

        "text": "So I live and work in a small town with one bank and where I work I occasionally have to go to the bank to get change but most of the time I will send my assistant. \n\n\nOn Monday I headed out and got about £170 of change and straight back to the shop I work to deposit said change in the till as we had run out of £1 coins. First bag I pick up feels light so I count them and only £13. I call the bank and after 20 minutes on hold I decide to drive back and queue again. \n\n\nThe lady who eventually serves me is the teller who was originally next to who served me originally so she remembers me from earlier (only two stalls). I put the change down and tell her what happens. When I mention calling them she said “well of corse no one answered we don’t man the phones there is no staff for that”  why have a phone then? I can clearly see five staff out the back and not one customer in the bank. That’s fine I’m here now so we continue and I don’t say anything about the phone. \n\n\nThat’s completely impossible” she tells me but then says “but il give you the extra just this once” all the while glaring at me. Then I ask her to weigh the bags as if one is wrong then I have no faith in the others. She weighs them and third bag is £3 up. “SEE this ones up” she says. “As if that matters, regardless will make my tills up which is just as bad...”.  \n\n\nWhen she finishes we discover 4 bags are wrong and we are over £10 down. The only response from her is “where’s the other lady?” I know she means my assistant and I ask her why, “Well we never have problems with the other lady and we weigh all the bags”. Clearly she’s insinuating i have stolen small change from my the store I manage, if I wanted to do that I could do it a lot easier than this. “Well I’m her manager and we will insist all bags are weighed in future this is pretty poor”.  And the only answer I got back from her was “ the other lady has never had a problem so it must have been something you did”. I was in such shock I muttered something about getting their change right and walked out but I am absolutely kicking myself for not asking for a manager. \n\nHow can the bank get change wrong! God knows how many times they have done that in the past.... \n\nI needed that rant thanks!\n\n",

I'm Asian but it was obvious that I was a foreigner since I only spoke English. \n\nAs I was paying, it took me a bit of time to figure out which bills were which. The shoes were around $60. (It was probably overpriced in the first place looking back on the quality.) As I was figuring out which bills to grab, the older woman ringing me up pointed to the $100 equivalent. I was a bit relieved that she helped me out and so handed it over. She then tried to hand me the equivalent of around $4 back. \n\nIt didn't fully register to me that it was only $4 and not the $40 I was owed, so I went to grab it. Luckily, her son/another worker angrily grabbed the bill from her and grabbed the right amount before handing it to me. Slightly yelling at her. I thanked him and quickly left.\n\nIf it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have realized that it was the wrong change until much later. I really lucked out. After that, I learned my lesson and got well acquainted with the different bills. \n",

        "text": "So this happened like 3 years ago. I accidentally dropped my laptop and the screen got majorly cracked. Not real worried because I had warranty I took it  to ( a major store that sells electronics) dropped it off at (the repair section) they told me they will call me in a week.\n\n I'm in college and I was super busy and my boyfriend would lend me his computer when ever I really needed to for school work. Well before I knew it a  month had passed by and I realize I totally forgot about my laptop. I check my voice mails and have nothing from (the repair) and have no phone calls that were from the store. I decide to head over to the store and explain that it has been a month since my laptop was dropped off and never received a call. The employee says he is sorry for the inconvenience and immediately pulls out the work order to  find out where my laptop went. He proceeds to tell me that my laptop  was shipped out to be repaired and that screen was repaired within a week over there.\n\n He then checks in the back and can't find my laptop. He goes back to the computer to check the rest of the the work order. He immediately looks really surprised and says I have a very long work order. He then begins to read me my work order. Laptop screen fixed. Laptop checked before being shipped found out camera is now broken. Laptop camera is now fixed. laptop dropped by  employee. Laptop keyboard now not working. Laptop keyboard fixed and screen replaced. Laptop dropped by employee laptop will not turn on. Laptop is being fixed. Laptop has been unable to fix and has been disposed of... This all happens in 2 weeks and they never called me to tell me they scrapped my laptop.\n\n  The employee immediately starts making calls and telling them on how I was not informed on my laptop being disposed of and how I have been in the dark for month. There solution was to give me store credit. I got like 600 dollars in store credit and used it to buy a new laptop. The thing is I hated my laptop and it was a display laptop. so when I had bought it was 40 percent off. My laptop worked real slow sometimes it would take forever to turn on. I only still had it because I couldn't afford a new laptop and needed it for school. Yes I was freaking out that they just destroyed my laptop and now I'm laptop less but once they told me I was getting store credit and alot  more money to use to buy a brand new laptop then what I had payed for the shity laptop I had no complaints. I left pretty happy that day. ",

That’s why it’s here.”\n\nE: “Oh, I wasn’t aware. No, but I will be sure it’s detailed.”\n\nNot cool, but she lives in a very dry state so no mold concerns, and as long as it’s cleaned out...\n\nTwo days later, she comes back for it. It is repaired, but the interior of the car is soaking wet. This is where she gets mad.\n\nS: “I was promised the car would be cleaned up because you guys left it open during a storm!”\n\nDifferent employee (D): “I didn’t know that. I wasn’t here when you came by, how was I supposed to know?” \n\nMy brother-in-law loves telling her response.\nS: “Do you not have pens and paper? Do you not communicate with each other?”\n\nSo they promised to take care of it, but she needed to take her kids to an event so she asked for a car for the trip. They tried to give her a Jeep.\n\nS: “No, I said I need seven seat belts.”\n\nD: “Are you sure?”\n\nS: “I think I know how many kids I have!”\n\nShe ended up getting a brand new minivan as a loaner. \n\nSo basically, no one knew what was wrong with the car except the person who she originally talked to, and no one left a note about the necessary cleaning. Communicate much? Later she told the story to a friend of hers that just so happened to be having a business lunch with the brand new owner of that dealership. He heard the whole story, I think things will be changing at that dealership.\n\n",

After waiting a couple hours to meet with a consultant and getting my laptop checked in, I left the store and headed to my car. I passed through a popular clothing department store and a pair of shoes I always wanted caught my eye. \n\nMe: hey! Can I try this in a size 8 please?\nAssociate: sure, I think the display model is actually a size 8\n\nI look at the tag and see that the size is actually an 8.5\n\nMe: oh, sorry, this is actually an 8.5 (shows her the tag)\n\nShe takes the shoes from me turns it over and shows me the store display tag that says 8.0\n\nHer: no, it's an 8.0 sometimes we have to fix the manufacturers errors\n\nThis doesn't sound like a true statement to me especially on a shoe of this price\n\nMe: well they look too big and I rather try on a pair of these shoes that actually says size 8 please \n\nHer: they are a size 8 (hands me the shoes)\n\nI set the shoes back down on the display\n\nMe: I rather try on a pair of shoes that are in my size please \n\nShe sighs and says she will go look and see if she has any in the back. After a couple seconds she comes back and says she doesn't have it. Oooook. I see another pair of shoes of the same brand that I like wnd would like to try those on too. \n\nMe: can I try these on in a size 8 please\n\nHer: are you sure you wear a size 8\n\nMe:...yes I'm sure \n\n She heads to the back and brings a pair out. \nThey fit well and I walk around a little bit in the department. My heart is still set on the original pair of shoes because I feel they are more versatile. I try on the 8.5 display model and they are too roomy in the toe area.  I decide to order a pair of them in the correct size but they can't have them shipped to the store for me and instead need them shipped to an address. I didn't have a address I felt was secure enough to receive the shoes so I declined the sale and left. \n\nDid I do something wrong? The situation was very uncomfortable for me as I dislike confrontation. It was also very rude and unprofessional when she chose to blame her coworkers labeling the shoe incorrectly even after I showed her the tag for the shoe and she still insisted it was the right size I wanted. The store was not busy and I was not rushing her or being rude to her.\n",

The total, with tax, was $1.92. I handed the young clerk a $1 bill along with 4 quarters in an effort to empty some of the change from my pocket. She announces that my change is 7 cents, and moves for the cash drawer. Without thinking, I say something like \"oh, that should be 8 cents\", not interested in collecting another penny so much as just correcting the slight error. \n \nThe clerk then tells me that I gave her a dollar ninety-nine, and that the change is 7 cents. I look at her, slightly baffled, and say \"no, I gave you a dollar and 4 quarters\", to which she replies \"yeah, you gave me a dollar ninety-nine\" with a slightly elevated voice. This catches the attention of the manager, who steps over to ask the problem. I explain that I had given the clerk a dollar and 4 quarters, and that the change from my $1.92 tab should be 8 cents. She agrees with me, but the clerk chimes in again, saying that I only gave her $1.99.\n \nThe manager hands me the correct change with my coffee and I turn to leave. As I near the door, I hear the clerk raise her voice even louder and say \"HE GAVE ME A DOLLAR NINETY NINE.\"\n \nI must have pondered this moment for a good 20 minutes after I left. Has she been short-changed her entire life? When looking at 4 quarters, does she consider 3 of them to be worth 25 cents and the last only 24? If I had, indeed, had enough change in my pocket to give her $1.99, why wouldn't I have handed her $1.95 or possibly the exact $1.92? I have to imagine that this young lady went home and complained about some asshole who didn't know the difference between $1.99 and $2.00, but the whole interaction has left me with many more questions than answers.

These are pills I must take every day for the rest of my life, and I was almost out so I needed them. This was on Tuesday. They said it would be there in 24 hours. \n\nBy Thursday I was out of pills and still none in the mail. I called the 800 number again to check on my order. After telling my story, I was almost instantly put on hold for about 12 minutes. When she returned, she explained that she “couldn’t even locate my prescription.” (????) I explained that I’ve been using this service for years and there should be no reason they can’t see my prescription, order history, etc. She asked to put me on hold again and I asked “okay, about how long to you think I’ll be on hold?” This woman said “probably two to three minutes”. I kid you not, I was on hold for 24 minutes.  When she returned on the phone, she explained that she found my prescription, found my expedited mail order, and it says it is “on its way” but doesn’t say when it will come. \n\nI asked the woman to email me everything she just told me so that I have proof that medication is on its way. It took her ten minutes to compose the email. I was getting impatient and told her to just write out a simple email explaining the circumstances and I will get off the phone with her once I received the email. Ten minutes later, no email. I ask her to send one again. She started typing again! I said no, please simply copy and paste what you wrote in the last one and re send it. Still never got it. \n\nI had already gone a day without medication and I couldn’t risk not having medication over the weekend.  I decided to put her on hold and call my doctor. After speaking to my doctor, they said they were unable to send a prescription to my local pharmacy unless I came in to their office on Monday. That would be five days without my medication. I was furious. \n\nBack on the phone with the online pharmacy, she explains that if my local pharmacy calls them, they can transfer the prescription. I reluctantly hung up with her even though I never received an email and called my local pharmacy. They called them and called me back to tell me that after being on hold for 22 minutes, they were told that they couldn’t transfer the prescription because my refill was used in the expedited order. \n\nAll in all, I was on the phone with the online pharmacy for 1 hour and 28 minutes and accomplished nothing. I was hoping the order would arrive today but it didn’t. Miserable. ",

I've never gone into one but I love tea and was just planning to look around and buy a box of tea or some cups. The shop was empty besides one woman behind the counter on her phone. When I walk in she just looks at me and then looks back down. Honestly, I don't care, I like shopping alone and not being asked too many questions. (Even if she asked a million questions I wouldn't care much my preference is just quiet shopping) \n\nAnyways, I made my way around the store quietly and see a green tea mix I wanted to try, but there's no price listed anywhere. No price on the bag or shelf so I go up to her and ask if she knows how much it is. She then reaches out and suddenly takes the bag from me in an angry manner, and rings it up and it turns out to be almost $60 if I remember correctly. Maybe I'm a cheapo but that just seemed out of my budget for tea. I say thank you, but then she asks if I'm buying it, pretty rudely. I tell her no, but thank you again. Then she just kinda, stared at me? I just awkwardly left after. I haven't been back to any tea store since, I'm kinda scared that they'll pressure me into buying something way too expensive. I can say no but I'd just rather not have to deal with the pressure at all :/ \n\nIs this a common tea store happening (the kind of pressuring you to buy something) or am I just paranoid because of one bad visit?

Then she said that it was not possible to ever have the same colour of thread, and the reason the stitching looked so different is that the original was done on a factory machine and she did it on a sewing machine (apparently this my fault for giving her suede). \n\nShe then threatened that if I didn’t like it she would rip out her stitching and just give it back to me with a hole in it as I was being unacceptable, or I could pay another 75$ for her to do it properly. At this point I think I was just staring at her, because really.... what... the hell...\n \nShe finally told the young man behind the cash to go into my file and ban me from the store.\n \nAt this point I was so upset and confused that I just left. As I walked away she shouted after me that she didn’t want my money and I needed to come back to get it. I said she could keep it mostly because I didn't want to walk past the customers again to go and get it. She shouted that she would rather donate it to charity than have it in the store.\n \nGuess I won't be getting my clothes tailored there... ever again...\n\n- and my skirt still isn't fixed. :(",

Usually I would grab a phone and ring support but at half 10 at night there was no chance of that.  But conveniently in the corner there was \"Live Chat\" button. I pressed it and was promptly connected to 'Pradeep'. Now I hadn't chatted to anyone via a banking website before and most of my experience of foreign call centers had been cold calling scammers so I double checked the address bar to make sure I was indeed on the right website and it did not end in *.in*.\n\nAfter being reassured I was in the right place I started to reply to Pradeep. He proceeded to answer my queries and sorted everything out. So far nothing remarkable (although I was very happy at this point). After I thought we had both said bye he messaged me again:\n\n&gt;**P:** May I please share a joke with you. Its a good one :-)\n\n&gt;**Me:** ok, go on\n\n&gt;**P:** Thank you :)\n\n*(now I'm thinking bless this guy. He's probably so bored out of his mind he's resorting to entertaining people in a different time zone)*\n\n&gt;**P:** Why didn't the **skeleton** go to the Halloween part?\n\n&gt;**Me:** i'm not sure\n\n&gt;**P:**Because he had no-body to go with. :-)\n\n&gt;**P:** A skeleton has no body how can he dance with somebody :-)\n\n&gt;**P:** Bye and take care! It was nice experience chatting with you today.\n\n&gt;**P:** I wish you a nice week ahead :)\n\n&gt;**Me:** that was a good one :D\n\n&gt;**Me:** thanks\n\nNow in all honesty I figured what the catch line was before he said it but I felt this guy was getting a kick out of it and I didn't want to spoil that for him. Work should be enjoyable.\n\ntl;dr: [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SLqubS4.png)",

It's Sunday around 1 p.m. in a small town in the bookdocks of Arkansas.\n\nWe walk in the restaurant and the line is out to the door.  But we're starving and options are few so we decide to wait.  Only one girl is working the register, but there are three employees sitting in seats playing on their phones.  We finally get to the front after 15 minutes and place our orders.  I order a bacon ranch salad.  This will be important later.  There's no receipt paper, so they have to give our receipts on the sticky paper they use to print orders on.\n\nI go to grab my drink and wait for my order.  They're out of napkins too.  Someone went and bought napkins from the grocery store.  Better than nothing, I guess.  I'm order #87.  My friends all get their orders of hamburgers but I'm still waiting.  And waiting.  Orders behind me are going out but I'm still waiting.  And the employees are ignoring me.  They're on order #97 and still no salad for me.\n\nOne girls, who isn't even on shift yet, comes up to me to ask what I'm waiting for and to track down my order.  She tells another girl to get my salad.  The other girl comes back with my salad and there's no bacon on it.  So I say, \"Excuse me, but there's no bacon on my salad.\"  She gets smart with me and says, \"There's not supposed to be.\"  So I snap right back, \"There's no bacon on a BACON ranch salad?\"  She shoots me a dirty look and walks off muttering something about me.  \n\nAt the same time, one of my girlfriends had to send back her hamburger because it wasn't even hot.  Another girlfriend had a wrong order but just didn't want to mess with it.\n\nSo we complain to the manager.  Turns out she's on the phone when we try and talk to her.  She finally comes out and tells us she's only filling in.  Doesn't apologize.  Just said, \"I know things are bad but I'm only the temporary manager.\"  We complain about all the employees sitting around and she says, \"Well, they were waiting to come on shift.\"  Maybe since your line was out the door, you could have let them start work a little early?  \n\nSo my friend and I both complain to corporate on-line and this is the response my friend gets back.  (I haven't changed anything except removing the name and location of the restaurant):\n\n&gt;Thank you for the time to share your recent experience at the Golden Arches located at tiny town in Arkansas .\n\n\n&gt; As the are supervisor of this restaurant , I apologize that you were not satisfied with your visit . \n\n\n&gt;I appreciated  the opportunity to personally discuss your concerns with you on the phone and wanted to follow up with this e mail .\n\n\n&gt;Our goal is 100 percent customer satisfaction and that means train employees providing friendly service every visit.\nGolden Arches (misspelled in the original e-mail) restaurant employees receive specific training in customer service .

But I started thinking “what if someone came in here and had dietary or religious reasons for not eating pork. I better let them know” \nSo I did and they were like ‘you’re serious?’  No man, I just say that for fun. Lol\nSure enough someone put the pork serving pan in the chicken slot.

He apologized and said he ran out of free burrito coupons and hoped this made up for it. \nAwesome! 4 more lunch dates with my husband and no one will eat pork that shouldn’t. Everyone wins.

The guy in the store lied to her about testing them and refused to test them in front of her. That night when we tested the games we called the store and the manager there was rude to not only my mother, but to me as well. He talked over me as soon as I started talking and he called me a retard. I decided to call the owner (who my mother had called before and he laughed when she told him that a child could have gotten a nonworking game for Christmas).

        "text": "So, we took out a USDA loan for some home repairs. In case you are not familiar with these loans, they are geared towards elderly and rural customers. Since I fit one of these categories and am on my way towards the second, I think I can say this: the majority of their customers are likely not very savvy.\n\nWe set up an auto pay through our bank account. The first payment comes out of our checking account. However, since I am a bit anal when it comes to my money, I wait a couple of days and call the USDA's automated call line to verify the payment posted correctly. Which it didn't. Of course, I then called and got a rep. I explained the situation, which to me, sounded simple. Some type of misapplied payment. What I heard from the rep caused me to blow a gasket.\n\nThe rep insisted that they had not initiated any payment. When I again informed them that the money had been taken from our account, they advised me that, and I am not kidding when I say this, my bank was \"testing\" the auto pay and that they would \"probably return my money soon\". I was livid, but kept my cool with the rep, thanked them and hung up. I immediately went to my bank to verify that they had processed the payment request and that I hadn't totally lost my mind.\n\nOnce I verified that things had happened as I thought, I sat down to call customer service again. But it bothered me. Most of their customers are older, or maybe not so familiar with auto payments. Some people might actually believe what the rep had said, and make a second payment. This bad information could really hurt some people with limited resources. I got angrier.\n\nSo I decided to go over their head. I called the Secretary of Agriculture's office and spoke to one of his reps. She advised me she would have the head of the call center return my call. A few minutes later, the call comes. I explain the payment situation, and he immediately sees my payment. It was one penny off, and had been posted to the escrow account in error. \n\nThen I explain what the rep had told me. He advised that all of their calls are recorded, and he would check it and call me back. He called back apologizing. I explained that while I hadn't believed what I was told, others might. He agreed, and then dropped this...management is aware of significant problems with many of the call center reps, but all they can is offer additional training as issues arise. I assume the reps might be Civil Service or something. Something prevents them from facing consequences more serious than retraining.  So very frustrating.\n\n",

        "text": "It was a cold Saturday night in December last year.\n\nMy wife and I visited the outlet stores near us because she had a couple things she wanted to pick up for one gifting reason or another.\n\nWe stopped into one of those \"you know you saw it elsewhere but it's cheaper here than that place\" stores that tends to go hand-in-hand with infomercial castoffs.\n\nWhen we entered, we were two of four customers.  The other two customers - a woman about our age and her pre-teen son - were only a few steps ahead of us doing a counter-clockwise walkthrough of the shelving and racks while browsing.\n\nAs we're perusing the wares and getting closer to the back of the store, I picked up a single $10 item that I *wanted* but didn't *need*.  The sole employee present - who had ignored our entrance, instead preferring to Facetime someone on a laptop - starts getting louder in his exuberant description about how he had gone to a college party, there were topless girls, and all the beer and heroin anyone could want.\n\nI heard the child say \"Mom, stop covering my ears\" but apparently some of what was discussed on this video chat hadn't reached mine - they were still a half dozen steps ahead of us as we walked through the store - but the conversation was not the sort of thing that should be had in public, let alone in a store, on video chat, by an employee.\n\nThe employee answered a call on his cell phone.  We started to approach the cash register; he \"lowered\" the lid for the laptop while still holding the phone to his ear.\n\n**E**:  Hang on a sec, actually have to do work for a minute.\n\nAs the employee was cashing out the first customer, she politely asked him for his manager's information.\n\n**E**:  I am the manager\n\n**C**:  I want your boss' number then\n\n**E**:  I don't want to give it to you\n\n**C**:  I want your district manager's number\n\n**E**:  Nope, still not giving it to you\n\nAt this point, I'm not in the mood for dealing with a purchase with this... person... so I put my single item back.  My wife waits outside the store's door, holding it open for the other customer and her son, and on my way past the register, the employee mumbles to the person on the phone\n\n**E**:  This bitch wanted to call my manager on me\n\nAt which point I get very, *very* angry and go off verbally on the employee.  (It's been a while, so this is as best as I can remember.)\n\n**Me**:  You do NOT badmouth your customers.  Without them, you wouldn't be here.  You wouldn't have your laptop or your cell phone or be able to go on those little awesome parties that you were talking about with your friend on Facetime.  Yes, we heard all of what you had said.  That is unacceptable.  This - your workplace - is neither the time or the location at which to have those kinds of conversations.  How dare you.  She is a mother of a young child and having him hear that kind of crap while shopping in a store is indefensible.\n\nI went on for a good minute and a half.  (To be honest, the employee looked a little contrite, but more than a bit confused too as to why I might be standing up for someone that I didn't know.)\n\nMy wife was standing outside, still holding the door, and as I turned to exit, another older couple was getting ready to enter but I saw them all staring at me - mouths almost as far open as my wife's - and as I started to exit they turned and beat feet far away.  \n\nSo I walked out of the store, turned the corner away from the windows, and leaned against a cold brick wall to cool and calm down. \n\nAfter a few minutes, we headed on to our next destination - one of those random toy/calendar/puzzle stores.  We wandered inside for a few minutes and decided not to buy anything.  While inside, my wife told me how while I was on my diatribe, that second older couple had walked up and was about to enter the prior store but apparently my... vehemence... scared them away.  When she told me that that same couple was about to enter the puzzle store moments later, saw me browsing and turned around and walked out, I then couldn't stop laughing.\n\nWhen we went to the center's customer service area a bit later to write a formal complaint, the guy behind the counter mentioned the other woman had made a complaint as well.  He also gave unspecific hints as to having received similar complaints about the same employee previously.\n\nI filled out the report.\n\nOver two months later, I get a random call from someone stating he was the franchise manager for several of the locations that we'd visited.  By this point, I'd almost forgotten the whole thing.\n\n**FM**:  While I cannot apologize enough for the behavior of this individual (*I noted he did not say \"my employee\"*) I do hope that you'll come back to our stores.\n\nMmm... two months after a report was filed?  No other comments?  Yeah, no, not likely.\n\n**tl;dr** Employee acts like a stupid moron, I dress him down, perhaps he ended up fired, but their management didn't give me the impression I was \"worth their time\" to retain me as a customer.",

I had just sold a piano for 100 bucks and I wanted to buy a gift card so I could buy Christmas presents online for my family. \n\nI picked up a 100$ gift card, walked over to the cash register and proceeded to do my thing. It goes smoothly enough, I pay 105 dollars, 5 for the gift card and 100 to go on it. I leave without an fuss and go home to activate it. \n\nWhen I get home though, I activated the card and the only balance on it was 1 dollar. I freaked out and my boyfriend quickly drove me back to the store, it has maybe been 20 minutes since I had bought the card.\n\nI go to customer service and explain the situation. First off, the lady accuses me of stealing the card even though I have the receipt with me. She then goes into saying that I can’t put 100 dollars on a 100 dollar gift card. I’m baffled and I start getting really upset, this was the only money I had for Christmas gifts and I’ve just lost it. The customer service lady starts telling me I must have just spent it all and starts yelling at me. I instantly start sobbing and she won’t stop. \n\nAt this point my boyfriend steps in and reexplains the situation and asks if we can just get a refund. She asks why he cares so much about my money and he tells her that it’s his money too. The lady tells him she can’t give him the money back even if her cashier messed up and the only way I can get it back is to call cooperate. \n\nSo my boyfriend asks if she can set that up for him and she scoffs and walks away. I’m honestly surprised he didn’t punch her or something, he gets irritated easily. \n\nAnother lady comes over and hands over a phone that is currently calling cooperate. My boyfriend then spends an hour on the phone to cooperate office explaining the situation and there is a convoluted way in which we can get our money back. It involved filling out an online form, sending a letter and waiting for a check in the mail. The original lady comes over and asks if I’m done acting like a child and then leaves again. \n\nMy boyfriend grabbed me and we stormed out. It’s been 2 years and I’ve never gotten my money back. I call every couple of months and they say I should get a check soon but that’s bullshit. \n\nI have never once been back inside one of these stores. Not once. I’ll drive farther to get to a different store to avoid this place. Fuck them. ",

        "text": "This happened over the weekend, at a local coffee shop in the city my family lives in. It is far away from where I live, so I've been there maybe 3 times before, the last time being two years ago. \n\nI love this one specific spice blend they use in a drink, and I had gotten it before in an iced latte. This time, I had just eaten a large meal and was too full for all of the milk that comes in a latte. I still wanted the spice blend since this would be the only time I could visit this coffee shop probably for another year or so at least. \n\nMy family ordered their two drinks, both iced lattes. Then I went up, and asked if I could have an espresso macchiato (just espresso marked with a drop of steamed milk for those who don't know what that drink is), but with a little bit of that spice blend in the drink. \n\nThe guy at the register was nice, but said they don't normally put anything in drinks on that side of the menu (?) and asked if I could just do the latte that included those spices with a little bit less milk. I didn't want the honey that came in that latte, I knew there would still be too much milk in the drink if I ordered it that way, and I just wanted a little bit of those spices not the full amount since the drink. So I asked if it would be possible to just shake a little bit of the spices on top of the drink, and I'd definitely be willing to pay a little bit extra for it. \n\nKeep in mind, this is a pre-made spice blend. So I was asking for the equivalent of shaking a bit of cinnamon on top of a drink. Then we paid, and tipped well because I work in a coffee shop, and I know that my tips always go straight to paying for my food and I appreciate them so I like to pay it forward. \n\nAs we're waiting for our drinks at the counter right next to where they're being made, I noticed that to make my family's drinks, the girl working poured the hot espresso directly into the plastic cups not meant for hot drinks so she could stir them without getting dishes dirty. This alone isn't the worst thing ever, but isn't great because it makes the cups melt/makes the drinks taste slightly like plastic. \n\nThen, when it came to my drink, I saw why the guy at the register had been trying to steer me away from customizing the drink at all. \n\nThe girl freaked out, called him over, and was like \"What am I supposed to do with this, she wants a macchiato, but with the spices? Why did you do this?\" \n\nHe said \"That's what she wanted, so that's what I rung up.\" \n\nShe just rolled her eyes and was like \"Ugh, I guess you did the best you could given the SITUATION.\" So then she went to make the drink, and dumped SO MUCH of the spices into the drink out of spite. \n\nWhen she called out the drink, I took a step forward (since I had been standing there the whole time, hearing everything) and was still trying to be nice, so I was like \"I'm sorry the request was a little weird!\" And she just blank face stared at me. She did not say a word. That lasted for about 10 seconds, and I'm not great in awkward situations so I didn't really know what to do and just turned and walked away. I know she heard me, because she made eye contact for that long just saying nothing. \n\nThe drink was nearly undrinkable, but it was expensive and I needed the caffeine so I still made myself drink it. I was really disappointed, because I had been looking forward to going to that coffee shop so much and it had been a rough weekend (a family member had actually passed away the night before and that's why I was in town).  \n\nI know that the owners of the coffee shop I work at would have wanted to know if an employee was acting that way where I work, so I sent the coffee shop a message on Facebook instead of leaving a bad review. I figured her attitude might not mean it's a bad coffee shop overall. However, they haven't replied yet and it's been 4 days so I'm kind of sensing they don't care and I guess may write a review to get their attention so they can help her improve her attitude/find a new job where she doesn't have to interact with people if she can't improve. \n\nTL;DR Paid $4 for a coffee that was made terribly on purpose because I asked for some spices on top, and didn't do anything about it in the moment because I don't like to rock the boat. \n\nEdit: Tried to fix terrible formatting because though this entire post is about coffee, I hadn't had any yet when I wrote it.

        "text": "In October, my wife asks me why the mortgage company took our mortgage (about $1750) from our account twice.  I realized I had made a very silly mistake...I had manually paid for the mortgage, but I had forgotten that I put it on autopay the month before.  And so I entered the swirling vortex of customer support.\n\nCall 1: I explain my mistake to the customer service rep.  He says \"No problem. I've posted that money back to your account. It's Friday, so you should see that money on Monday.\"  That was easy!\n\nBy the next Wednesday, that money is not back in the account.  I'm concerned; it's not a tiny chunk of change, and since we have a trip to Disney World coming up a month later, it would be nice to have some extra money in there.\n\nCall 2: I ask the rep why the money was not posted back to the account.  She tells me that in order to return the money, they need evidence from the bank that the money was taken out, faxed or e-mailed to a special e-mail account.  I tell her that the first rep told me he had just okayed it to go back to my account.  She informs me that the first rep was wrong, and that they don't have the authority to do that.  I ask why they need proof from the bank that they have my money...shouldn't they know if they have my money?  She tells me that's the procedure.\n\nI ask her if I decide to just not get the money back, would it just automatically become my November payment.  She tells me that they can suspend my autopay for November and that I wouldn't owe anything until December.  I pause, thinking that we could live without the money this month as long as we didn't have to pay the mortgage next month.  I tell her that I'd talk it over with my wife and call back.\n\nMy wife and I decide that we're fine just letting that money apply to November's mortgage bill.\n\nCall 3: I get a rep that seems a bit more elderly than the others.  I tell her the whole story and ask her if she could make it so I don't autopay in November.  She tells me that it says that I don't owe any money until December, so the system wouldn't take money from me in November.  I ask if she's sure.  She says yes, I definitely, definitely won't get charged in November.  I thank her.\n\nNovember 1: I get charged another $1750.\n\nCall 4: I tell this new rep the lengthening story.  She says she's not sure why the last rep told me that I wouldn't get charged. They have the ability to suspend autopay, but it's something they have to do manually.  I tell her that now, because of the upcoming Disney trip, I really do want that money back.  She is helpful, describing exactly what I need to send to the special e-mail address.  She says that if I put my bank and routing number in the e-mail, they can expedite the return of the money.  Otherwise they would cut me a check.  I thank her.\n\nI make a trip to the bank, have them print out the correct info, highlight it, write a detailed e-mail, and tell them specifically what I want them to do.\n\nToday (November 13): Still no money in the account.  The trip is next week, so I decide to check on the status.\n\nCall 5: I tell the now very long story to a new rep (5 for 5!)  I ask if he can check on the status of that money.  He asks if he can put me on hold.  He hangs up on me.\n\nCall 6: I tell the story to a very confused rep.  At the end of the story, after putting me on hold twice, she says that normally when someone overpays, that money sits in an account and then is applied to future payments.\n\nYes, I said, I know that, but I wanted this month's double payment back so I could hold onto it and then pay it again in December.\n\nShe told me that she didn't think they just returned money like that.  I told her that the previous rep had given me detailed instructions, and that they HAD to have a process to return money. If I had typed in the amount I wanted to pay and hit an extra 0 and paid 17,500 by mistake, would that just be too bad, so sad for me?\n\nShe then went to check on the status of my e-mail.  She said that they mailed a letter three days ago (unreceived yet by me) that said that they had reviewed my request and had applied the money to my December payment.  I told her that THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO DO.  I wanted that money back in my bank account.\n\n\"Maybe you didn't specify in your e-mail that you wanted it back in your account,\" she said.\n\n\"I gave them my bank account and routing number! I don't know how much clearer I could have been.\"\n\nShe goes to speak to a manager.  She comes back and says that she can get it straightened out, but she'd have to create a new ticket.  On hold again.\n\n\"Okay, I've created a new ticket.  It looks like if we put this in motion today, you should get your money right around the time that your December payment will be due.\"\n\n\"But...I have a vacation next week...\"\n\n\"I can guarantee you won't have that money next week.\"\n\nI told her to forget it then, and to put my autopay on hold (and made sure that she understood she needed to do this MANUALLY) for December.\n\nI full expect December's payment to be taken from my bank account.\n\nHonestly, I was using Disney to get pity points; we're not hurting and it's not going to affect our trip.  But there are a lot of families out there for whom an extra $1750 payment out of their checking account could be devastating.\n\nEnd result: 6 support calls. Three of them gave me demonstrably wrong information, and one hung up on me.  Nothing was resolved. A seventh person behind the scenes was also inept at their job.",

        "text": "This actually happened tonight. We decided after my husband got off work and my mil daughter and I got done with what we were doing to get some dinner. It's 8:30pm and they are closing in an hour and half. Our server was absolutely amazing. He actually kept us fed with free chips and refills before we needed it. He engaged our daughter and it was so sweet him asking her what she wanted-she's 3. I got the massive 10 inch burrito and he even remembered my 2 requests on the side. After we boxed up our leftovers he brought us more chips to take home! We've only gone for lunch but tonight was amazing! They consistently get 100 on their health scores the place is always spotless and the food is made fresh to order. We recently lost a Mexican restaurant closer to home due to a death in their family so it's nice to have somewhere to get good Mexican food! It's so much better than the fast casual chains. That's my awesome customer story of the night I thought it would help seeing so many stories of bad food and bad service. ",

At the moment they were have a deal buy 1 get 1 half off and a couple others (buy 3 for 2). \n\nAt the moment there was only me and a stocker across the way putting up pop bottles and cans. I'm about to pick out a couple of bags of party mix before I feel my foot in pain and get pushed aside. \n\nThe stocker catches me, looking shocked as this older lady dashes through the aisle grabbing bags of snacks like it the end of world, then turning the corner like its a race way. \n\nThe stocker and I are kind of surprised, he asks me if I was okay and I just nod still dazed. I look around before going up and grabbing my snacks off the shelf and going to the check out.\n\nI didn't see the lady when I was checking out, I kind of hoped she rammed her cart in something solid and she got her karma (Probably not though). \n\nI thank the employee who caught me. Thank you. (If you are reading this) ",
