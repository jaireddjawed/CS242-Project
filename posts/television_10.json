After learning that the writers were offered more episodes and said no, and had a contract for a Star Wars series, makes me more pissed\n\n2. I would be 10 times more aggravated if I watched this week by week, for 10 years. And even more aggravated knowing the wait between seasons 7 and 8 was TWO YEARS and we only got six episodes \n\nHonestly? I’m FINE with what happens in the ending. You want the three eyed raven to become king? That’s okay with me, but don’t have dialogue saying how he doesn’t want to rule and now he suddenly wants to, and maybe I don’t know; make him a little more likeable? And make it seem actually realistic with how it happens.\n\nThe Jon snow and Dany love arc? That’s fine with me, I think that’s great. But it feels SO rushed, they fall in love in what seems like a few scenes.\n\nWant Dany to become the mad queen? That sounds awesome! Too bad it feels forced and ridiculous. The flip to her becoming the mad queen is so unrealistic.\n\nThe amount of plot armor these characters had towards the end was INSANE as well. I couldn’t believe Jon snow survived everything. Great character, I would’ve been sad to see him actually die.\n\nBut Jesus, he should’ve died countless times. The shots of the main character cast being all swarmed in winterdell, and NONE of them die? I mean, come on. \n\nI could go on and on. The first 4 seasons of this show was awesome. But I’m just so disappointed :(",

Tales from the Darkside is on right now, and honestly these seem pretty good (I don't think it's available streaming). I found Friday the 13th the Series on YT and have been watching that, though that was one whose title turned me away in the past, not knowing it had nothing to do with the movie franchise. It's not anything amazing, but it's good mindless fun - though some of the episodes are pretty decent.\n\nOne I watched the whole run of was the 70s British show \"Thriller\" which was actually quite good. This was after seeing it on something like Comet or Pluto where I caught it in \"broadcast\" and then went back and found the series streaming.\n\nBTW not interested in any relatively modern shows that are only available on one streaming service - and things like Black Mirror - I watched the first one and that was a turn off, but I tried a few others to give it a fair shake and still it wasn't really all that good. Tried the Philip K. Dick one, which I had high expectations for, but it just didn't seem that good. So maybe the 1950s - 2000s unless there's something you really feel is a \"must watch\".\n\nThanks!",
