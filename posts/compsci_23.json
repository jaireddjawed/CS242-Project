It's pretty difficult to watch your own health in any field as we get busy, but Computer Scientists don't only face debugging issues; we also have to deal with mental and physical health issues as well. Feel free to join and share any health issues you are having as well as find help too! Thank you all.\n\n**Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhealth/\n\n\n*The subreddit is mainly geared towards developers, programmers, and Computer Science students, but anyone can join and contribute here as well.* \n\n\n\n**Discord Server:** https://discord.gg/uG8aRrt",

I said its lite since It doesn't require calc 3 as pre req but our prof ended up going over a bit of continous multivariable distribution so I learned a bit of informal double integral stuffs, most of the course still focuses on 1d distribution.\n\nSince I am a transfer student, my credit is messed up and I found out taking calc 3 will be counted as an extra course not counted on my degree. Also, I am leaning towards software programming more than thereotical CS and I might be planning to take a master in something that are more applied like HCI (if that matters). What do you think ?",

        "text": "Okay, so counting in binary is not so difficult.\n\n01 is 1\n10 is 2\n11 is 3\n\nAnd so on and so forth. However, let's say we have this\n\n1111 is 15\n\nNow, when we say the numbers as words we would call both of these \"fifteen\". However, the decimal number makes more sense being stated as \"fifteen\" because the word has a decimal representation of this value. If I go to the next value up, it's \"sixteen\", until we hit \"nineteen\" where the second digit increments  and the first resets back to 0 and we call this number \"twenty\". The phonetic word rolled over just like the decimal value did. But, the binary representation rolled over much sooner!\n\nLet me simply write out the numbers so you can see what I'm talking about\n\n01111 is 15 is fifteen\n10000 is 16 is sixteen\n10001 is 17 is seventeen\n10010 is 18 is eighteen\n10011 is 19 is nineteen\n10100 is 20 is twenty\n\nSo, you see the word twenty works with decimal representation 20, but it makes no sense using the same word for 10100 as this binary number does not roll over into the next digit sequence of binary!\n\nMy question is, is there a system that has been made which is used for counting binary numbers in speech? Or has that not been done yet?\n\nIf it hasn't here is my suggestion for a system that could work. Give each separate digit of binary numbers a different phonetic sound. So here would be an example:\n\n0000 is \"Not\"\n0001 is \"Sigh\"\n0010 is \"See\"\n0011 is \"See Sigh\"\n0100 is \"Sow\"\n0101 is \"Sow Sigh\"\n0110 is \"Sow See\"\n0111 is \"Sow See Sigh\"\n1000 is \"Fo\"\n1001 is \"Fo Sigh\"\n1010 is \"Fo See\"\n1011 is \"Fo See Sigh\"\n1100 is \"Fo Sow\"\n1101 is \"Fo Sow Sigh\"\n1110 is \"Fo Sow See\"\n1111 is \"Fo Sow See Sigh\"\n\nAs you can see, this system of words for binary would allow us to reduce the number of words that we use when speaking about a binary number, it would also allow an individual to identify a binary number after the first phonetic sound has been stated (instead of waiting for the speaker to finish the binary number as we would normally do if we just said one zero one one zero). This system also groups the binary numbers so that we know how large this value is in terms of binary instead of decimal.\n\nThe phonetic examples I picked are just examples too, there's probably better combinations that would make more sense.\n\nLet me know what you think, is there a system like this already? If so what is it called? I look forward to your replies!\n\nEdit: i wrote this on my phone. I'll probably format it better tomorrow some time. Please forgive the bad formatting for now, thanks!",

If the answer is just digging around PubMed or NCBI or something that's fine too but I was wondering if anyone knows of a good journal/website (preferably free) that has in-depth pieces on Neurocomputational studies, neuroprosthetics, advanced imaging, etc.\n\nI'm assuming there may not be something that can go into depth on both the Neuroscience and Computer Science aspects but figured it was worth throwing out there! I'm very interested in both things but haven't done much reading of studies at the center of that spectrum so I'm hoping someone can give me a starting point. Thanks!",

        "text": "I'm very interested in app development and would really enjoy spending my summer learning it and actually creating one of my ideas and publishing it. My school lacks resources for learning app development so it's something I'll be self-teaching. I really enjoy interactive lessons such as Codecademy but understand that that is not always available. Specifically learning development of Android apps since 1. I own an android 2. I do not own any Apple products to use XCode on.\n\nSo what worked best for you to learn Android app development? What resources and online lessons would you offer? Are there any online projects that have a walk-through on how they built the app so I could just follow along? Thanks!",

So sorry for that up front.\n\nThat being said - it seems that the recommender algorithms in YouTube, Facebook\nand such are optimised to make us click things, engage and generally waste time\n(or so it seems).\n\nIn a sense they're currently working for us, but (certainly in my case) it's\nrarely the case that they're really working in my interest, rather they're\nsatisfying a part of me that I would rather minimise than maximise. I don't\nthink that there's some conspiracy involving triangles or whatever, it's just\nhow it is.\n\nBut what I'm wondering about is whether we'll ever have more control over how\nthey work, in respect to what they suggest. And whether there will be any that\nmitigate the amount of time we spend on certain domains / activities etc.\n\nI'm not sure how to phrase this in a way which doesn't just warrant a response\nof \"if you don't want to waste time on X then stop doing X\". For the sake of\nthis thread consider that I'm aware of this option, and hope that you \"get the\ngist\" of what I'm saying.\n\n**Basically** - they're currently engineered to optimise clicks and interaction.\nDo you think that there will be any in future that are instead optimised towards\nhelping us to achieve our personal goals and ambitions? Or, are there any ideas\nout there along these lines? \n",
