        "text": "This is so petty I'm half embarrassed to even be posting here, but my husband and I are losing our minds. My husband and I purchased a house over the summer and we moved in back in August. We have a neighbor that has 3 cars, refuses to use their garage, and will park a 3rd car directly in front of our house. They live on a corner, so they have a whole side street and another parking spot directly in front of their house. My husband has several times tried to have a conversation with them, letting them know that when they park there, we and our guests have no other options. The house says they don't feel comfortable parking in front of their house because they feel like it is a blind corner, which is it not, you can see down the whole street when you aren't even in the neighborhood yet, so it is not blind. We have even gone so far as to park our own cars there to show it is not a blind corner.\n\n This resulted in them literally blocking in our driveway because they were upset my husband parked on the street, in front of our house, where they had been parking. They continue to refuse to compromise and park on the side street with no other homes or use the spot in front of their own house. They also refuse put any vehicles in their 2 car garage. We live in an HOA community but the only rule about street parking is that you cannot be there for more than 72hr at a time. \n\nEvery 72hr I report their car to the HOA and they move it the next day, just to do the same thing and leave their car in front of our house. I feel like this is just a continuous cycle of them being extremely disrespectful and entitled and I want to find either a way to settle this in a civil or malicious but not illegal way.",

        "text": "So we got a new manager at my work, she covers the overnight stocking shift and the first few hours the store is open\n\nI work at a big warehouse store, lets call it Bostco. Anyone whos shopped there knows theres a wall of sale/display items right when you walk in. At our location, it borders the electronics department\n\nDue to electronics having down-time between customers, they have the secondary responsibility of removing any empty boxes of product from the display to avoid a wall of empty boxes. They usually collect these boxes on a flatbad, and take them in one trip to our bailer, on the exact opposite end of the building\n\nRecently, the new manager decided it was Too Messy Looking to have that flatbed parked there, because generally the boxes don't need to be cleared until mid-afternoon. The flatbed is parked in an unused corner, against a wall, does not block any aisles, and is only visible if you decide to wander from appliances to look at school supplies. Nobody is finding this flatbed\n\nWhen they tried to explain to her the purpose of the flatbed, she got upset at their \"excuse\", because SHE'S never seen more than a box or two on it before, and clearly they were just being lazy. When they tried to talk her down to allowing a simple shopping cart instead, she freaked out and informed them that they will not leave any boxes laying around\n\nSo for the last few days, anytime a box is cleared, so several times an hour, the understaffed electronics department gets Much Worse! Because the only people who can answer questions about TVs, laptops, headphones, ect, is making the 2 minute trek across the store carrying cardboard, and then 2 minutes back, just in time to make the trip once again\n\nIts been two days or so, there have already been complaints about lack of customer service, and we're approaching a busy weekend. At this point, we're taking bets on how long it'll take before management notices and has to scold the new lady again (shes messed up a lot of things, but this is the only MC)\n\nTLDR- instead of allowing an out of the way cart, allowing many boxes moved at once, my coworkers are now abandoning their post for several minutes to carry the boxes one by one",

        "text": "Reddit\n\nSo this happened a while ago, just remembered it after reading some posts. I was broke and living in a homeless shelter when this happened.\n\nSo I was in the homeless shelter, some guy pulls up and asks me and some other guy if we wanted to move his stuff from his house to his new apartment. Said he’d pay is 25 bucks for 1-1.5 hours of work. Pretty sweet deal and I needed the money, so obviously I said yes. \n\nThe guy who went with me was in his 50s and I was in my early 20s, small white kid. He kept making me look dumb/slow, doing everything faster than me and criticizing every little move. Even the guy who owned the stuff said he didn’t know what he was on. I mean this dude jogged down the stairs carrying some pictures to the U Haul. Whatever, not gonna lose my shit cuz some random dude is having a bad day (realized later the reasoning behind it when he asked for $50 instead of $25 because he did my work for me. Go figure).\n\nAnyway, we are almost done, just carrying the fridge down the stairs. It was already sketchy in itself, going down stairs with a fridge on a dolly. He was again trying to make it look like he did all the work, trying to push the dolly down the stairs by himself. Offered to help on the other side but all he said was “no you’re just going to mess it all up, just hold the cord in the back”. I could already see where this was going, but hell what do I know. He gets about halfway down, and the fridge fell off the dolly and hit the wall.\n\nHe tried blaming me, saying “that’s why you should go on the other side to help” but I played the innocent part: “oh I’m sorry I was just listening to you I had no idea”. He knew I was playing dumb, but he just gave me a stare because he knew he was in the wrong. The owner of the house, came down and asked what happened. I told him I just held the cord, other guy dropped the fridge. He knew what probably happened, what with the other guy giving me a hard time and everything. Made him pay $50 bucks for the damages, basically $25 since he still gave him $25 for the work. \n\nHe also didn’t give me a hard time after that, I think he learned his lesson.",

This happened last week and felt like sharing it. \n\nI work at a brewery that also serves food and one of our most popular food items is the Big F'ing Pretzel, a soft pretzel that's at least a foot wide. It is served with different dipping sauces on the side. You can pick two out of nacho cheese, garlic butter, marinara, or spicy mustard. One guy came in and was waited on by one of my supervisors, Lizzie. I was walking by while Lizzie was off taking care of another table, and the guy asked if we warmed up the marinara we served with the pretzels. \n\nI said no, but I would warm it up for him. So I took the little plastic cup and went into the back to warm it up. Our microwave doesn't have a spinning plate and works pretty quickly. I put the cup of marinara in and gave it a few seconds, as I didn't want it to be too hot or warp the plastic too much. It was only a few seconds, but it should have warmed it up. He said it was still too cold for him when I took it back. \n\nLizzie was back and suggested I put it in a bowl, and maybe add some more before microwaving it. I did as she suggested and put the bowl in the microwave and put it in. I warmed that bad boy up enough that the marinara splattered on the bowl, I tested it and I swear I nearly got a blister from that damn bowl. So I took it out to him, then went on my merry way to pick up a table. I was helping Lizzie clear off the bar and noticed that the bowl was still mostly full. \n\nJerk-butt said it was still too cold.",

        "text": "When I was a child, I used to get brutal debilitating headaches that hurt so much they made me nauseous all the time. They started when I was about 5, and for the next 11 years or so, I would escape home and go to school, and then when I got home from school I would go straight to bed until some adult made me get up to do chores or to eat. The headaches were later diagnosed as stress headaches, but that is another story for another time. \n\nMy father did not believe that I was sick and always accused me of faking it to get out of doing things that he thought I did not want to do.\n\nOne Sunday morning when I was 13, I was so nauseous that just moving my head made me want to vomit. I begged Dad to let me stay home from church. He assumed I was faking to get out of going to church, and made me go with the rest of the family. \n\nI survived the church service, and my heart sank afterwards when he suggested that our family and several other families all go to a buffet restaurant for lunch. When we got to the restaurant I stayed at the table and did not get any food. Dad got mad and accused me of sulking and being stubborn over not getting my way and having to go to church. I insisted that I was sick and nauseous and really couldn't eat anything.\n\nSeveral of the other families from church noticed that I wasn't eating and told Dad that I was obviously sick and he should take me home. Dad got mad at me for shaming him in public. He insisted that I show everyone that I was faking by drinking some tea and acting less lethargic. I told him it was a bad idea, but he insisted and I knew from experience that resistance was futile.\n\nSo, I took a deep breath and then chugged a full cup of tea. I immediately vomited all of the table and several people's plates of food. \n\nDad took me home after that.",

        "text": "Not the most elaborate form of malicious compliance, but one that was quite satisfying to me at the time. I'll stick a TL;DR at the bottom - this happened a few years ago.\n\nFirst off a bit of vague background - I work in an office environment and my job is mostly comprised of admin tasks (entering data, answering calls), project/offline work (creating schedules, capacity planning, etc.), and a component of more on-demand, real-time work.\n\nIt's a fairly stressful working environment and as such department headcount can fluctuate wildly, depending on just how much pressure the boss puts on us and how green adjacent pastures are. At this point a couple of years back, I had been with the company for at least 3-4 years and had endured several bosses as well as large-scale restructuring.\n\nWhile not perfect, my attendance was very good especially in comparison to my colleagues at the time (some of whom had children, so I understood emergencies happened). I rarely had to call in sick and would usually just suffer through sinus headaches and not-full-strength migraines because we would often be short-staffed for our workload. I was also the sort of person who could cover a shift at a moments notice because I was pretty flexible with timings and lived only 20 minutes away. (Yes, shift work because we had to work the hours of ops the business units we supported worked).\n\nAnyway one Friday afternoon I was feeling like absolute garbage and clearly coming down with something flu-y. It wasn't a day where I was doing the on-demand work tasks or working the closing shift, so I basically told everyone I was going to leave early. Colleagues and boss had no issues so I packed up and headed home for a fun weekend full of fever and pumping myself full of OTC drugs.\n\nMonday rolls around and due to the lack of sleep and general malaise, I still feel like garbage. I know the limits I can push my body to function, especially when my work demands I be largely coherent and I know going into work is a bad idea. So I fire off a message to my boss to say I really need another full day to recover from deathflu, I'm not working a closing or opening shift so it should be fine, see you tomorrow, etc.\n\nMy boss, ever the fan of unnecessarily long responses, comes back with a mini-essay basically saying he wants me to get a doctor's note because I've been sick since Friday. Bitch, what? First of all where I live there was no legal requirement to provide a note unless you were absent for more than 3 consecutive shifts (a law which has since changed to you can't request one AT ALL). Second I just told you I needed to rest and now you want me to go out in public with and hang out with a bunch of other sickies? Third I had only left maybe 1.5 hours prior to the end of my scheduled shift on Friday, not a full day.\n\nI know full well if I try to argue any of these points however that I will be met with another wall of text laced with throwaway sentiments of concern for my well-being. So I say sure I'll get your note.\n\nOkay, you need some proof? I'll get your proof. I pulled on some barely presentable leaving the house clothes, head to the walk-in clinic in sniffly misery and wait a couple of hours before seeing the doctor. Doctors are pretty easygoing, especially since they get paid for doctor's notes - not a lot but for the basic fee of $20 you're often met with \"sure, when should I write you'll be returning to work?\". If memory serves this particular doc asked directly \" you need 3 days to recover, right?\" \"yep\"\n\nDoctor sends me on my way with a nasal spray and a note saying I won't be in until Friday - upon recommendation from my physician. I return to my apartment grinning and send my boss short text advising he'll need to cover my upcoming closing shifts - doctor's orders!\n\nTL;DR - Boss demanded I get a doctor's note for a one day absence despite my full intention to be back the following day, has to cover shifts and workload for 4 days instead.\n",

        "text": "Back in my youth when I was in the navy, I was an  aircrewman on P-3C Orion maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft. The flight manual was a giant blue book called the NATOPS manual, it very specifically prescribed all of the check lists, emergency procedures, system operations etc. NATOPS is the bible for flight crew. \n\nOne of the duties of the observer or in flight technician was a procedure called setting condition 3, a system check immediately after take off. Youd have to check the hydraulic bay, the main electric load center, and you had to check the wings and engines through every window and make sure we didnt lose any panels (like 40+ year old planes some of them) Some of the windows were at crew stations, so you had to lean over another crewmans sensor station to get a view. \n\nNATOPS says for setting condition 3 you shall wear; helmet, flight boots, survival vest, dog tags,  gloves.\" Nothing about an actual flight suit. \nSo we're taxiing to go on a mission. I'm sitting opposite him in the back of the plane by the sonobouy tubes and he strips naked and puts back on exactly what NATOPS says. Everything except the flight suit itself. The survival vest is just a vest with some straps that go between your legs. \n\nSo we get airborne and he takes off and did his condition 3 checks naked from the waist down dragging his balls across millions of dollars worth of sensor station trackballs and keyboards. He stuck a naked armpit in someone's face while checking if the engine cowl had TFOA'd of of #3 engine. Things Falling Off Aircraft reports are a bitch. \n\nSo normally when you're done setting you run up to the cockpit and tell the copilot and flight engineer that 3 was set and that plane had survived the takeoff. But instead, he took a whip crack slap to the penis from the flight engineers slide rule. I guess he tried to set a nut on the throttle controls. Flight engineers dont play that shit I guess. \n\nBut yeah, good times. It was an all male crew for the record, this wouldn't have flown if there was a female crew person. We weren't that savage. You fly with the same dozen people every flight for a few hundred 12hr flights, and you build a weird crew dynamic. And sometime balls and asshole and literal interpretation of the blue natops bible are part of that dynamic. ",

        "text": " \n\nI was told to put this here from, so here it is...\n\n**Background stuff:**\n\nIn the late 90's and mid 00's I worked for a regional bank in the mid west, The Bank. At the end of that career there I was working in the Corporate BSA department. This department does reviews for anti-money laundering (AML), Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), suspicious activity reports (SAR), currency transaction reports (CTR), and monetary instrument log reporting (MIL).\n\nMy primary function was working with the CTR non compliance. A CTR is required if an individual, or business, either deposits or withdraws over 10k in cash in a banking day. It can be innocuous such as a Mc D's franchise owner's separate restaurants making their deposits (some had more then 15 locations), but it could also be relevant to discovering money laundering, structured deposits, and so forth. The department orientation and training went over how important it was to keep up with CTRs and gave some examples of banks that got fined in the millions due to non compliance and how they were going to make sure that The Bank was not going to be made an example of. So it was made very apparent that I needed to get the required documents from the flagged branch sent in and sent out and to do what was needed to make that happen. I believe that it is more automated now at The Bank, but at the time the teller would get notified that one was needed with the customer there, so they could fill it out with the customer present, and then they would fax it to our department.\n\nSo you can understand how important this is here is a recent example of when the government came down hard on a bank for BSA related issues:\n\n[https://www.americanbanker.com/news/regulators-fine-us-bank-more-than-600m-for-aml-errors](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/regulators-fine-us-bank-more-than-600m-for-aml-errors)\n\n**Story:**\n\nI was in charge of their largest state, IL. I think that the highest branch number was in the mid 300's and all of them at that time were either in Chicago or its surrounding suburbs. After doing this job for a bit one gets a sense of what banks are good (Joanna at branch 108 was the best) and which ones just don't give a rip (which quite often were located near each other). I always tried to give them the benefit of the doubt as we have all seen how busy a bank can get. I would call a branch once a day about their CTRs and it would be something like this:\n\nCall 1: Politely ask to have them fill it out and fax it to me.\n\nCall 2: Politely ask to have them fill it out and fax it to me.\n\nCall 3: Firmly tell them it needs to be done and fax it to me.\n\nCall 4: Talk only to branch or assistant manager and politely ask that it be sent to me.\n\nCall 5: Talk only to branch or assistant manager and firmly ask that it be sent to me.\n\nCall 6: Talk only to who ever was in charge and have them get someone to fill it out with me on the line and tell me when they faxed it.\n\nAt any time I was given issue by the branch in this process I had permission to page, yes page, their regional manager for assistance to get it done. I was even given permission to page their divisional manager if the regional was either non responsive or non compliant.\n\nOne of the \"problem\" branches pops up on my report and I go into the bank system and type the branch number in. The branch's page, which the branch is responsible to keep up to date, comes up and I call the listed number. I look through the list of tellers, assistant managers, and manager on the page. I recollect some of the tellers and assistant managers, but can't remember ever speaking to the manager.\n\nDay one I call and receive nothing from the teller I spoke to.\n\nDay two I call and receive nothing from the teller I spoke to.\n\nDay three the branch manager (BM, which is fitting because she was a turd) answers and I think maybe I'll get someone professional. She seemed that way, however I get nothing.\n\nDay four I call and the BM answers again and the conversation goes something as follows:\n\nMe: \"Hi, BM. We spoke yesterday about a CTR and I was wondering if you had that filled out for me?\"\n\nBM: \"No, I'm busy!\" /\\* She's not even trying to be polite \\*/\n\nMe: \"I understand that you're busy, however the Federal Government requires that you fill this form out. So I am going to need you to do that today.\"\n\nBM: \"Don't tell me what to do. I said that I'm busy.\"\n\n/\\* I am getting fairly frustrated at this point. \\*/\n\nMe: \"It doesn't matter if you are busy. You still have to fill out the form. So can you go do that for me now?\"\n\nBM: \"No, I don't have to do anything. I'm not doing it. So don't try and tell ME what to do.\"\n\n/\\* I've now had my fill of her and say what normally gets a lazy manager going \\*/\n\nMe: \"Listen, if you don't fill the form out I'm going to contact your regional manager.\"\n\nBM: \"Pfft. Go right ahead, wuz he gunna do?!? BYYYYYE!\"\n\nShe then proceeds to hang up on me. I am fairly certain that she thinks that I was bluffing to contact the regional manager (RM). That could be understandable since I had to page a regional manager 7 or 8 times and a divisional manager twice the two years I worked in that department. So it was rare. This is one of those 7 or 8 times.\n\nI call the pager, type my desk number in, and wait. I don't call other branches, I don't continue on with my other work. I just wait so that way I don't miss the call. My phone rings about 20 minutes later.\n\nRM: \"This is RM, did someone page me from here?\" /\\* RM sounds a bit flustered and impatient that I am interrupting his day, which I am to be honest \\*/\n\nMe: \"Yes sir, I did. I am calling about an issue I am having getting a CTR from one of your branches.\"\n\nRM: &lt;Long drawn out sigh where I can practically hear him rolling his eyes&gt; \"Okay, what's the problem?\"\n\nI then go over the issue and tell him verbatim her last words before she hung up on me when I told BM that I was going to call RM. It's at this point that RM's voice perks up a bit, sounds engaged, and replies:\n\nRM: \"Oh, really? THAT'S what she said? I'm going to let you go, but I'll get back with you in about an hour.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay sir.\"\n\nWe end the call.\n\nThis time I go about my business and start doing my work again. My desk phone rings me in about 15 minutes. Lo and behold it's BM, hat in hand. She started out by giving me an apology, then telling me that it was filled out, and then asked me where to fax it. I tell her the fax number and let her know that I can wait until it arrives. I pull it off of the fax and rather than be completely civil about it, but opt to nit pick the hell out of it.\n\nThis is the form that needs to be filled out:\n\n[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/fin104\\_ctr.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/fin104_ctr.pdf)\n\nMissing occupation, missing DL#, missing date, Section III is empty except a signature... The first pieces needed to be filled in, but not really that last one. Before we filed them the BSA department had to retype them up so they weren't in pen or pencil and to compile CTRs from multiple branches into one form. The retyped form always used the corporate headquarters address and info and never the branch it came from, so making her do it was just for my own enjoyment.\n\nShe told me that she didn't know the occupation, so I let her know that she would have to contact he customer to get it. She gives me no shit, says \"Okay\", and hangs up. She calls back 20 or so later and tells me that she just faxed the updated form. I go check it and tell her that the occupation (Business Owner) is not descriptive enough, which was true, and that she will have to call the customer back and find out the type of business. She sighs again and lets me go.\n\nAround 15 later a very flustered BM calls me back telling me that the customer wasn't happy and wanted to know why he had to give her more information, but she was able to get what was needed and that she sent it. I looked it over and let her know that it was satisfactory and we ended the call.\n\nAbout 20 or so later RM called me back and wanted to know if she apologized and if I got what I was looking for. I let him know that I she did and I did. He then wanted to know if having to call a branch so many times for one thing was a common issue. I told him not all branches were that some were better than others yadda yadda yadda. He wanted to know if I could inform him about his. I asked him if he could list some of the branch numbers he was in charge of and looked them up and let him know which of them that I had memory where I had to call multiple times for the same thing. He thanked me, I thanked him, and we ended the call.\n\nA couple of days later BM's branch showed up on my report and when I go to call them I notice that BM is not listed acting branch manager, it's blank. The assistant manager I spoke to that day was now very respectful and sent me the form without delay. Some point from there and the next time I called they transferred a branch manager in from one of the better locations RM was in charge of. Around that time I also noticed that all of the branches in his region were now sending them when I called or before I even had to.\n\nFor the last year that I worked there if any of the branches in his region would go past the 2nd call I would let them know in the 3rd call that if I don't have it completed by end of day that I would contact the regional manager. I never had to contact him again.\n\nTL;DR - Troublesome bank manger doesn't care to enforce federal reporting rules. I call to ask for compliance of the oversight and am told she won't do anything and nobody can make her, boss included. I call her boss, she does what I want, and then he still fires her.",

I hope you enjoy.\n\nSo this was about 8 or so years ago. At the time I was in the Marines, either a PFC/LCPL at the time. My MOS was 0811 Canon Crewman. The unit was called a Battery, composed of 6 guns, with anywhere from 6-10 Marines per gun. Along with Marines who did the fire trajectory calculations and what not. \n\nWe are at Twenty Nine Palms California, the base of which, is a giant love fire zone. Everywhere you go once in the training portion, is covered in craters and spent ordanance shells, and some UXO (duds that can still very much become a not dud if you fuck with it). \n\nSo after a long day in the sun of fire missions, our CO or XO let's all the gun chiefs know we have to shuffle some ammo around the gun line to balance the counts, make sure everyone is capable of any type of fire missions. \n\nWell this sucks in an of itself because all of the projectiles weigh about 100lbs. And each gun is about 100m-150m away from each. And we are in a landscape that is just covered in holes, oh and the ground is so dry, being the Mojave desert and all, in some places the ground acts like a thin layer of ice on soft snow, you'll just sink in. So carrying a howitzer round in the best of conditions sucks, but saddle on the terrain and now it's straight shit.\n\nOh but wait, there's more! Our training days go well I to the night, so now that the \"day\" is over, we have to lug these rounds gun to gun, in the dark, in a land that is like Swiss cheese. \n\nNow it's the military, you do what your told or youll face actual legal action for disobeying a lawful order, or more commonly, youll just be hazed for a while. \n\nNo one is happy about this, at least no one that wears black on their collar is. But we gotta do it. \n\nMalicious compliance time - it's hot, the day's been long, we are tired, so let's at least have a modicum or fun here. I got completely naked aside from my helmet, my boots, and my glow belt. And hauled a round to each gun on the gun line, and made sure to announce myself loudly as I came on each gun, usually to the reaction of a bunch of lights turning my way to help guide my way, followed generally by a chorus of laughter. One of the guns had the XO and gunny on it when I come on so I got ushered away quite fast\n\n\nThe next morning in the chow line, gunny greeted me as 'naked ninja'\n\nHe saw, but the XO did not",

        "text": "Several years ago I flew to the Midwest (United States) on a business trip. I took a rental car to a hotel where I had stayed once before. Instead of parking out front, checking in, then moving my car around the side, I parked in the side lot. I was wearing a sport coat and tie. I grabbed my computer bag and was pulling my rolling luggage along side of me. As I got to the side door of the hotel, a lady was hurrying to get inside and she quickly pulled the door tight behind her. This left me standing outside the locked glass door. I tapped on the door and the lady pointed to the door handle and held up her room key right at my face and loudly stated “you need a room key to get in!” \n\nFair enough. I cannot disagree. She watched me walk around to the front of the building.\n\nLater that evening I strolled out that same side door, crossed the parking lot, and sat down for a bite to eat at the restaurant next door. While dining, the weather turned bad and the sky opened up with a fierce rainstorm. When I was done eating, I went up to the cashier to pay. And guess who got in line behind me to pay? It was my card holding, door closing lady friend. She was there with who I assume was her husband and two restless kids. \n\nAs I finish paying and turn to leave I hear her say she’s going to take the kids and make a run for it through the rain back over to the hotel. Oh yeah? I’ll race you to the door!\n\nThe rain is pouring down in buckets. Water standing an inch deep all through the parking lot. I actually slowed down a little bit, making sure I didn’t arrive too far ahead of her. \n\nI got to the door, inserted my room key, and stepped inside the dry hallway. The door clicked shut just as the lady arrived behind me. She grabbed the door handle and pulled hard, but she was too late. Locked tight. She looked at me with her wet hair matted to her face. The rain coming down hard and no shelter over her head. I pointed to the door handle and held up my room key right in her face and loudly stated “you need a room key to get in!”",

        "text": "Hello, first time poster, on mobile so apologies for formatting. Also sorry if the TL;DR is too long.\n\n\nRead the post on the English grading and got reminded of this little incident back when I was in college. This was a few years ago during a Subject ABC(for anonymity) class. This class was compulsory for my major and major ABC. Therefore this class was made up of mostly ABC majors and just a small number of us. \n\n\nProfessor wanted to use this online platform for two of our online assignments and decided to grade it through the rating system available in the platform. (The following story is the first online assignment, and the second online assignment grading changed after we destroyed the first one.)\n\n\nThis online platform allows students to create questions, and their peers can answer them and comment on them. Basically the assignment was that we had to think of multiple choice questions related to the class, and other students would rate the question and leave a comment, and if the comment is good, people could ‘Star’ the comment (works like FaceBook likes). The higher the rating your question has and the more stars you have on your comments, the higher overall rating you have, which is what the grading is based on. \n\n\nNow obviously this assignment can be a competition of how many friends you have rather than how good your question/comments are, and my friends went to talk to the professor after the lecture to tell her that this assignment can be gamed. She agreed with us and said she’d change the grading system to be based on participation (submit 2 questions and answer at least 20). She announced this change in the next lecture, however, in the lecture after that, she announced that she changed grading back to the overall rating as some students have emailed her saying that they have put a lot of hours into researching the perfect question that would get them a high rating, and if it were to be changed to participation, all their efforts would be wasted. Not wanting to waste their efforts, she decided to change the grading back to the rating system.\n\n\nThis is when our major declared war (not publicly, just among ourselves) against the ABC students. We were also triggered by how the professor kept bringing up topics in other ABC classes which we did not take, so we were already losing to them in terms of prior knowledge. \n\n\nSince we were a small group, it’s easier to coordinate a collaboration. We started a Google doc and shared it with everyone in our major who was taking this class. We then shared the link to our questions, and pasted our comments for easy identification. We rated every question on the gdoc with the top score, and left a comment and starred comments that were written in the gdoc(Comments were set to be anonymous).\n\n\nAs a result, my major topped the rating charts and we aced the assignment. Professor was horrified at some of the comments which were simply “Good Question” but received a ton of stars. Professor then changed the 2nd assignment to be participation, with extra credit awarded for quality submissions, vetted by her.(She should have just done that from the start)\n\n\nTL;DR Professor wanted to grade an online assignment through peer ratings, informed her that it can be gamed, but in the end she sticks to grading via ratings. After which we gamed the system so hard the people with the highest ratings were me and my friends.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, throwaway, etc. Not a huge MC but one I'm kind of proud of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all happened about 10 years ago, so I don't remember the small details too clearly. I live in a bustling city in Southeast Asia where a fair amount of affluent (but not *too* affluent) kids are sent to Catholic schools. The school I went to advertised itself as Episcopalian, which to my understanding was Catholic without a lot of the saint worship, but a lot of our religious studies material more closely matched western Protestant stuff. The students were mostly composed of kids from families who either resided in the greater area nearby, or had businesses in the area. So there were a fair amount of kids in my batch who had family businesses like restaurants, hardware stores, etc. These kids were already helping their families out, so for them there wasn't too much pressure in getting absurdly high grades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStudents were sorted into sections/classes based on their GPA, but the sectioning also had a gender ratio that was enforced despite different GPA averages between males and females in the batch. In my last year of high school, my batch had a lot of female academic achievers so this meant that they had two sections for higher achievers (first and second). I hadn't been doing quite as well but my GPA was at about 87% (out of a possible 100%) which meant that I should have qualified for second section. For some reason, whoever was sorting us female students decided that I would be cut off because my surname started with a certain letter; basically if I'd had a letter A surname I might have made it into second section, but due to some kind of luck I was that far down in the list. So the sorter put me into third section, out of a total five sections. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't make too much of a fuss about it since we'd already submitted our previously acquired grades to universities for the entrance exams, so I decided I'd just chill for my last year at school with the lazier students in my section. Third to fifth section kids were a mix of academically struggling students and lazy but bright students who mostly went to school to socialize. There was a lot less competition with grades and stuff since people weren't really trying. They knew what my GPA was, and while I wasn't bullied or anything, they looked out for me in exchange for a few free answers or two during quizzes so they wouldn't fail outright. I happily complied since if I was going to get lumped in with these kids I might as well act like one and make new friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately for me, the school assigned the better teachers to first and second sections and shittier teachers to third-fifth sections. This meant that instead of getting assigned the chill math teacher I had last year, I'd be getting a snob of a math teacher that I'll call Mr N. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr N taught math for the upper years at our high school but as I hadn't dropped to third section until that year, this was my first time encountering him. He was on the older side, droning and speaking in english with a heavy local accent. He also had a bad habit of speeding through the basic explanation of how a particular math formula works, then getting the class stuck on the ensuing exercises while telling us off for not listening to the explanation the first time. After a few sessions with us he started preaching about how lazy and boisterous we were (we were pretty noisy!), and gave us a new seating arrangement while proclaiming about how Jesus is going to separate us like the biblical sheep and goats. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe noisy and lax students were seated in the goat half of the room while the quieter and more obedient students were seated in the sheep half. This was accurate to the bible verse he was quoting, down to which side the goats and sheep were on; goats were on his left side (right side of the classroom) and sheep were on his right side (left side of the classroom). For some clarity, we don't move between classrooms in between classes; the students stay in their section classroom and the teachers move between each section depending on the class schedule for the day. This meant that every time we had math class we'd have to move around to our sheep/goats seating arrangement. It got annoying for me pretty quickly since I was originally seated at the \"goat\" end of the classroom and my \"sheep\" seat was nearer to the other side of the classroom, and I'd have to lug my bag around each time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis went on for most of the year until Mr N told me off one day for \"story telling\" when I was asking someone about an assignment, or something, I don't remember what exactly I was doing, but it pissed me off. I had been doing pretty damn well in tests despite not really paying a lot of attention, and I was pretty quiet and mostly doodled in class. I figured I was tired of being classified as livestock, and decided to do something about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd been experimenting with Photoshop at home and when I got home that week I figured it was time to use those skills for something a little bit MC.  At the time, it was a fad to wear badges on your school lanyard, and most people wore badges with band names or anime on them. I decided to capitalize on this, so I went on Google images and found some cute clip art of cartoon sheep and cartoon goats, and made badge designs with text that said \"Proud to be a sheep/goat\", with the corresponding animal on the badge. I decided to get the rest of the class in on it, and the ringleaders in class (who were mostly goats and a few very enthusiastic sheep) told me to go for it and helped me get badges made for everyone in class. They liked the badges so much that they requested one sheep and one goat badge each.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the day that I'd distributed the badges, everyone wore them on our id lanyards; the sheep were wearing sheep badges, the goats were wearing theirs, but I was wearing one of both because fuck it why not. Mr N's class came and he was a bit puzzled at why we were all wearing badges, but I think he dismissed it as some fad. However this is where we found out that Mr N had only been doing the sheep/goat sorting in OUR section and not the others. Everyone from the other sections started asking questions on why we were all wearing animal badges, including a couple of teachers who were a bit friendlier to us. Word seemed to have gotten out, because the next time we had class with Mr N, we were told that we didn't have to use the seating arrangement anymore. I'm not sure if Mr N ever got into trouble for it, but at least I didn't have to leave my seat just for math class anymore!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Religious math teacher has special seating arrangement dividing my class into biblical sheep and goats, I comply by making sheep and goat badges for everyone. Teacher stops enforcing arrangement after people start asking questions, while class got to enjoy cute badges.",

Two weeks later, I noticed that the exact item went on sale for 20 bucks cheaper. Now in Canada, Amazon will not price match but I decided to call them anyway to see what could be done. I spoke to the representative who told me that Amazon will not price match but put me on hold to talk with her manager. She came back and had the following conversation:\n\nAmazon Rep: \"Hi, thank you for staying on hold, my manager says that you can send the item back in and we will refund you the amount you paid for the item. You can then re-order the item for the cheaper price. I'll create the return slip right now\".\n\nMe: \"So you're telling me that I can re-order a new item, and then send back the new item by using the return slip that belongs to the old item?\"\n\nAmazon Rep: \"Yes. And this process will save you the 20 dollars plus tax!\"\n\nMe: \"So Amazon is willing to incur the shipping fees associated with shipping me the new item and then incurring an additional shipping fee for me to send back the item so that I can save 20 dollars plus the tax?\"\n\nAmazon Rep: \"Yes...\"\n\nMe: \"Are you sure you don't price match?\"\n\nAmazon Rep: \"Yes, per our policy, we don't price match in Canada.\"\n\nMe: (mind blown) @\\_@, \"Okay thank you\"\n\nSo I then had the item sent the post office right beside where I worked, opened the box for the new item, inserted the return slip, taped the new return label on top of the original shipping label and gave it right back to the post office rep...all done in front on him. And saved 20 bucks plus tax...\n\ntl;dr: Amazon wouldn't price match an item for me so I ordered a new one and sent it back to save some money...FBA policies...",

It's an ok gig, the people I work with are mostly decent, the hours are ok, the pay isn't great - but I've had worse jobs.\n\nOne location that I work at as a parking attendant is an event venue with a large empty gravel/asphalt lot.  This thing has no lines to indicate spaces, it's right off of a busy road, and has giant holes.\n\nWhen we park people, it's vital to park them in nice, tight, neat lines. If a show sells out, we can - and have - run out of spots.  Some people don't like being told where to park.  They complain and complain and get into arguments with my supervisor.  Now if someone parks in the middle of the lot, that's a problem because then we need to try to park the remaining 200 cars around them.  It's really important that they park in nice neat rows - there are fire lanes to worry about, and the fact that people need to get out.\n\nOne of my supervisors is a crusty older guy who's been doing this for 20 years. Some people throw a fit and want to park closer (say 20 ft away instead of 60 ft, and, we have a handicapped parking area for people with a placard/plate or even if they say they are we usually just believe them). If they're an asshole to my supervisor, he lets them park closer. What he doesn't tell them is that he pretty much makes it impossible for them to leave until everyone else does.  The bonus is we leave once all the cars are in, say 9/9:30 PM for a show that gets out at 11PM.  So we aren't there when they leave. The venue likes us and knows about this and they don't really care either.",

I was assigned the 11 yr old classes, and these kids were sweet, but they'd been taught the GPA is more important than ALL things. \n\nThe school had a rule. If you failed, you were allowed to retake/redo the assignment as many times as it took to pass. So they'd do things like intentionally bomb tests to know the questions, and then retake it for a 100. And plagiarism was *rampant*, they'd copy directly off Wikipedia for essays, whatever, on the off chance we wouldn't catch it and they'd get a perfect score for grammar.\n\nIf you plagiarized, you were supposed to be given a zero. So it was a no risk situation....or so they thought. I went through this circus a few times, before I finally got fed up. I'm trying to grade these essays, and over 90% of them were direct copy pasta. One even was from the wrong set of articles because he didn't bother to parse what he was copying. I gave the two kids who actually did the assignment 95% with some grammar corrections. Everyone else....\n\nNo zeros. I printed off each article they copied and stapled it to their essays. And then I gave every one of them a 67%. Technically passing. No redos. It brought everyone's marks down CONSIDERABLY. The wails when I handed them back the next day were music. Other teachers tried to tell me \"I couldn't do that\". I ignored them, and you know what?\n\nNone of them did it again for the entire year. Win!",

It started out quite small, just little jabs at each other, but over a couple of months it's devolved into full-blown arguments on the shop floor, both of them calling in sick all the time to dump more work on each other, refusing to speak to each other when they do manage to come to work on the same day, and generally making everyone else's lives miserable.\n\nThe general manager has given them both verbal warnings for their conduct, but nothing else has really been done. Now, neither of them really talk to me much, aside from complaining to me about each other, so I wasn't expecting to be dragged into the matter any more than I already have been, but last week I got a message from each of them, just one day apart, and both asked me exactly the same thing - to write a letter to HR saying that I've seen the other girl's bad behaviour and the negative impact it's had on the workplace. They've both claimed that I'm their friend, and they hope I'll have their backs.\n\nBut, to tell you the truth, I'm fucking sick of both of them, so I decided to do exactly what they had both asked me to do. Immediately after getting the second message, I wrote up a letter to the HR rep, detailing the appalling conduct of both girls, describing how their stupid feud has been making everyone else in store miserable, and outlining every way in which their behaviour flies in the face of our company's policy and goals. I signed it, got it signed off by my GM, then sent it to HR.\n\nIf they hadn't each asked me to rat on the other, this would have blown over. Instead, this morning, my GM told me that both girls are scheduled for a disciplinary review, will both be given written warnings, and could even face demotion. Don't drag me into your mess. I just want to sell clothes.\n\nEDIT: for some context: the two girls are merchandisers, and they’re the only two we have which not only makes them hard to fire, it means they work Monday to Friday on the same shifts. Managers have tried to intervene before but it hardly ever happens in front of other people (until the shop floor arguments started). We’ve also had a lot of managers shuffled around to and from different stores, plus we’ve been understaffed, which means they’ve gotten away with a lot more than they should have. Also my GM is pretty gutless when it comes to confrontation. \nAlso I now realise that I did the TL;DR wrong but I’m standing by it ",

My bathroom is the best. Giant shower heads, amazing water pressure and heat as it being super modern and just generally a nice bathroom to use. My parents En-suite is ok, the shower hasnt got much pressure or heat but they dont seem to mind, so it ends up being that me and my brothers use our bathroom, and my parents use theirs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow its my job to make sure that my bathroom is clean, which is very reasonable and fair. I do a good clean once a week, but with 2 younger brothers, you can imagine the bathroom gets fairly dirty fairly quickly. Im a bit of clean freak usually but recently ive had to pull a lot of double shifts at work and do almost 16 days in a row, so my cleans haven't been as thorough as normally. But the bathroom has always been clean enough that im not worried when friends or my girlfriend come over, so i wouldn't call it dirty by any account.\n\nNow my mum decided to do a massive spring clean so to speak, and wasnt happy with the general dirt in the bathroom. (i.e dirt in the medicine cabinet ect, not toilets) and had declared that since i wasnt taking good enough care of the bathroom i would no longer be allowed to use it! Instead i would have to use their bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell this is fine by me, ill miss the shower but its ok. In 24 hours i have made sure to not step foot in my bathroom, and only use the one in their room. This is so far how its gone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I woke them up getting a shower at 4am.\n\n\\- I woke them up going to the toilets at 2.30am and 5am.\n\n\\- I watched the tap keep running in our bathroom\n\n\\- I did a really smell no.2 in the toilet and it stunk out their room\n\n\\- I disturbed their chilled out reading time on multiple occasions\n\n\\- I enjoyed watching my mum clean the bathroom from my 2 brothers as i no longer use that bathroom, so dont have to clean it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts been 24 hours or so now and i can see that they are slowly getting cranky, as i sit here drinking another litre of water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor anybody who may think im mean for doing this to my parents:\n\nIm 19 years old and pay £400 in rent not to mention buy all my own things and help with a lot of chores, the bathroom is and really was very clean, just no one can ever live up to my mums cleaning standards. Thats not a me thing, my dad and my grandmother have been saying it for years. I appreciate this is mean to my parents, but its pretty unfair punishment considering the mess i clean up is only ever my brothers. They can make it all stop when they go back to letting me use my bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: parents will only allow me to use their en-suite bathroom, so i make sure to be as inconvenient as possible so that they let me use my own again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I love how this story turned into a massive comment thread on what food is best for making smelly farts. Reddit; i love you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Or really, one essential detail. The principal banned students from bringing eggs. He was able to frame it as an allergy thing but the text of the new rule was \"Students are not allowed to bring any eggs.\" \n***\n5th graders are sarcastic little terrors. It turned out that the next week's biology curriculum for 5th grade included a section, which said, among other things, that boys have sperm and girls have eggs. You can see where this is going already.\n\nThe day after that lesson was taught, two girls actually didn't show up to school, and the office got calls from no less than four parents who said that their children said they didn't have to go to school because they have eggs and they are not allowed to bring eggs. Fortunately, the parents are able to use their brains and still brought their kids to school. But, those two girls who didn't show up? The school office called the parents, who said that their girls had said they weren't supposed to go to school and they believed them.\n***\nThe principal did change the wording of the rule to \"Student's lunches may not contain eggs in any form.\" but the damage was done, those girls were able to skip school, and his supervisor had a good laugh. At least he didn't get in trouble for that one.\n**Tl;dr: School bans eggs, school teaches that girls have eggs, girls skip school.**\n\nEdit: Typos, READ PART ONE PEOPLE!\n",

        "text": "Second-hand story, posted with permission.\n\nI was talking to a principal of an elementary school. He told me a story about a special needs kid at lunch. This kid was tossing an egg into the air and catching it. Since his hand-eye coordination wasn't too great, the principal was worried about him hitting somebody. He walked up to the kid and told him to eat the egg or throw it away. The kid says \"It's raw, I can't eat it!\" Why the kid had a raw egg, the guy has no clue. So he says, \"Ok, then throw it away.\" The kid says \"Where?\" and the guy answered ('stupidly enough' were his words), \"Doesn't matter, just get rid of it.\"\n\nSo, the kid throws away the egg. But not in a trash can. By shouting \"YEET\" and flinging it across the playground. Right into a volunteer playground monitor. Who was wearing an expensive dress (for some reason). And this kid plays little league as a pitcher, so that s*** was going fast. The woman's dress got damaged, and she got bruised.\n***\nBecause the kid was special needs, and legitimately thought that it was OK to throw the egg because \"that's what Mr. Principal said!\" the principal was the one who got in trouble. The fallout was limited, which was good for the principal. He had to pay for the dress out of pocket and apologize to the kid in exchange for not getting written up. Now, this is a school district where a teacher once poked a special needs kid, and the police showed up, so he thinks that he got off easy. Also, to prevent this happening, again, the principal banned the students from bringing eggs.\n**TL;DR: Kid has raw egg, principal says to throw away the egg, kid throws away egg and hits somebody.**\n\nEDIT: [Link to part 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/9ij3io/double_trouble_part_2/?)",

My colleague took care of the Macs in the east building, and I took care of the Macs in the west building.\n\nHe was working on upgrading some software on all his Macs to the latest version. One of his users refused to allow him to install the upgrade, because she didn't want to learn the new version. She took to shutting down her computer at the end of the day, despite the rule that all computers be left running to allow us to administer them remotely at night (scheduled pushes, that sort of thing).\n\nHer department was using iMac G5s at the time. These particular iMacs all had bad capacitors in their power supplies. There was an Apple program where they would replace the power supply for free, but it had to fail first. We had advised all the users not to turn off their computers at all, because it was very likely that the power supply would fail during startup and they would not turn back on again.\n\nNaturally, this one user continued to turn off her computer at night to avoid the scheduled software update. And naturally, one morning it would not power up again.\n\nMy colleague was on vacation that day, so I pulled the ticket: Mac will not power up. I was sure I knew what had happened, so I headed over there with a cart. She wasn't in her cubicle when I arrived. I turned on the desk light, to verify that power was getting to the outlet, and I reached for the power switch on the iMac, to verify that the computer would not power on. Before I reached the power switch, the user came back into the cubicle, saw me, and hissed, \"Don't touch it!\"\n\nI walked away without a word, and resolved the ticket: \"User refused service.\" She had no computer until my colleague got back from vacation. He provided a replacement computer… with the latest version of the software installed.",

He's in charge of hiring drivers, finding jobs, and deciding what drivers to put on what jobs. \n\nA few weeks ago, someone came to my dad and asked how much he would charge to do a few deliveries over the next few months. My dad let him know that it would be $115/hour. \"well that's too much money!\" \n\nDad explains to him that all of his drivers are already on a job that's paying $115, so my dad can't just put a driver on a job worth less money, when they could be making that much. This guy let's my dad know that another company said they will charge a flat rate instead of a per hour rate. And they are charging $850 to take one load to this site and back. \n\nMy dad thinks for a few minutes and tells him, \"I'll match that price for a month, and see if it's worth it to keep doing that. By the end of the month I'll let you know if we can keep the $850/load.\"\n\nNow, my dad is pretty good at math. All he did to decide if the $850 would be worth it, was to calculate the time it would take to run a load and if it was less than $115 it was no go. Thing is.. the drive to the site and back was only an hour and a half. At my dad's original offer, it would have been around $175/load unless there was bad traffic. But it would still take around 7 hours to be worth $850.",

It was about 2 hours away from us so we planned to go shopping while we were there since the base we were taking him to had a much better exchange. \n\nWe had a dog, a beagle.  Being the young, messy person I was, my jeans were in the floor where I took them off.  In my pocket was my military ID card.  Apparently my dog sniffed it out and chewed it up a bit.  Not terrible, but there was some damage to the expiration date.\n\nSo, we're driving the two hours and get to the gate.  The gate guard takes all of our IDs and looks at mine.  Tells me they can't accept it because the expiration date is illegible.  They have to confiscate it.  Ok, whatever.  What do I need to do?  They tell me I have to fill out a statement and get a temp pass.  No problem, or so I thought.\n\nI fill out the statement, which asks for details of what happened.  I put \"My dog ate my ID card.\" Easy, right?  Nope.  Not for them.\n\nThey read it and tell me there aren't enough details.  Um... Ok... I asked what more they needed and they just said it wasn't enough. \n\nHere's the MC. \n\nIt became story time.  I started it out \"On the night of xxxxx, my black, white, and brown beagle, approximately one year of age, decided she was bored.  She has a great sense of smell and found my ID card in the back right pocket of my jeans.....\" \n\nI filled up the paper. The whole thing. I told the greatest lost ID card story in history.  It was a lovely tale. \n\nI handed the paper to the guard and asked him if that was enough.  He read it, I saw the smirk on his face that essentially said, \"Touche, bitch\", and he gave me my temp pass.  \n",

I work at a gas station/fast food mishmash know to the states of and around Pennsylvania and Ohio. I am a common retail salesperson, the subject of the malice is my newest supervisor. I've been at this store/on night shift for years, she's been here 2 months. \n\nThis new supervisor, seems to lack common sense, and respect for those she works with. No worries, I've dealt with worse bosses before. Or so I thought. She made a lot of changes, most were bad and very temporary, some lasting a mere few minutes. One change, however yet stands the test of time. She changed who was responsible for brewing coffee.\n\nIn my store, there are 6 urns that can hold up to 3 pots of coffee, and they need to be cleaned and filled by 3 am. The shift I am on is 10 pm to 6 am, so there is plenty of time to get it done. \n\nIt used to be the cashier's task to brew the coffee, but now it is kitchen's job, and it certainly couldn't possibly ever be a supervisor's job, that just wouldn't do, ever. Kitchen does not, on most nights, have the time to do this task by 3 am. It definitely wouldn't be done by 1:30 am, the usual time it took a cashier to do it. So an addendum to this change came later from on high (store manager) to \"allow\" supervisors to do this task, as they normally float between cashier and kitchen duties already.\n\nI, and my fellow members of the Night's Watch, have interpreted this to mean that the new supervisor alone bears the duty to brew coffee. Cashiers can't, and the kitchen staff are just, too busy....\n\nAnd the coffee has been late and stale for the past month or so, but 'suspiciously' only on her shifts. \n\nTL;DR: New supervisor changes rule for worse, has to follow through with said rule, and does so poorly.",

        "text": "I work at a restaurant with a lot of guys from my local high school. That’s really cool because I always have friends or at least people I know on shift, or so I thought. What I didn’t think about is that not everyone is as work minded as me, (I’m there to work, not to chat for money) and that shit doesn’t get done when there’s a bunch of us high schoolers on shift. \n\nIt was on such a Saturday that I was really just not having a good day. School was rough, I had a sore ankle from yesterday, and was generally just aching to get home. My “side work” (work to do after all of the customers leave) was restock all of the glassware on the shelves for tomorrow. Usually that’s not a big deal, but we had JUST received a huge shipment of glasses and mugs a few hours prior. After running all of them through the dishwasher on their trays, I had about 10 racks of cups and mugs. This might not sound like a lot, but the racks are 5x5, so 25x10=250 cups. I was not feeling like stacking cups for the next 20 mins, so I walked out into the dining room where my buddies were half rolling silverware, half talking, and asked for a hand real quick. They looked back, saw the racks, and blew it off, saying annoying shit like“You got this one big man”. Feeling more than a little bit pissed off no one would help me with my simple but time consuming task, I hatched a plan. \n\nThe shelves we put the cups/mugs on were pretty large, but as soon as I eyeballed it, it was clear we ordered way too many cups and they wouldn’t all fit on there. BUT, I also knew that if you really wanted to, you could cram an extra layer or two of cups into the thing, but that makes it really hard to reach the cups as they’re basically underneath the next shelf. I never did that because it’s a real pain in the ass, but upon further consideration, I didn’t work the next day, and the people who were screwing me over did! I began stacking cups (we layered them on top of baking trays) and filling up the shelf as much as I could. When the shelf was full, I eeked one more tray layer of cups in there, having to lean all of the way under the shelf just to cram them in there, with maybe an inch of room between the top of the cups and the bottom of the next shelf. After about 20 mins of doing this while silently chuckling to myself, I clocked out and went home. \n\nThat next Monday, I was greeted upon punching in by a group of pissed off friends, who told me that they had been getting complaints from customers about their drinks taking too long (because they had to carefully pull out glasses from underneath a shelf they barely fit) for most of the shift. I just laughed and told them “Well, I put the glasses away, didn’t I”. Let’s just say that now I don’t have issues finding help restocking glasses.\n\nTL;DR: My friends at work refused to help me put away +250 new glasses, so I set them up for success the next day by squeezing them all into a shelf that should not have been able to fit them. This caused them to have to gingerly grab out each glass and piss off the customers for taking forever.\n\nEdit: Yeah I’m aware that it was a bit of a dick move on my part, but it was not my day, and I always help out the others with their side work before I even start mine, so the one time I asked for help, I was kind of expecting at least some.",

        "text": "Long time lurker, never thought I’d have something to post. Pardon the formatting, I’m on mobile. TLDR at bottom. \n\nThings you need to know: I have 3 roommates that each give me their portion of the rent and I pay it in full. Our apartment complex has an option to pay rent online. We have a grace period of 3 days before we’re considered late, at which point we can’t pay online anymore, the account gets locked out. We have to go into the office and pay via cashier’s check and then they allow you to log back in. \n\nTwo months ago, logged into the website and went through the motions of paying, even getting the “thank you for your payment” screen like usual. I thought rent for that month had been taken care of. Come the 4th day of the month, we get a slip of paper that says “late payment”. Naturally, I went to look online to find information, but found my account locked and a short message that said something along the lines of “talk with the leasing office”. \n\nI walked in and spoke with the Property Manager (PM), who had a pompous attitude the entire time. I’m also going to cut out the part where she asked me for my apt number but I’m going to say it because some of you might ask. \n\nMe: “So I got this late notice and I’m confused as to why because I paid rent.”\n\nPM: Checks something on her computer and then looks at me “According to this, you didn’t. There were no attempts to pay rent on your apartment’s behalf.”\n\nMe: “I KNOW that the payment went through on the website. It showed me the thank you screen” I pull out my phone and show her the screenshot I took of it along with the bank withdrawal. \n\nPM: “Theres no date on this screenshot, so I can’t take this as proof. Maybe store your proof with date via e-mail for your records. Since you’re a day late, here’s the amount you owe.” \n\nNow, I wanted to argue more, but I had just gotten back from school and really wasn’t in the mood. I go to the bank and get a cashier’s check and then go back to the office. She takes the check from me and I take a moment to stop at the little corner with all of their business cards and get one for each member of staff. This has their e-mails. \n\nNow, she didn’t tell me that I should send it to myself, all she said was “via e-mail” so that’s exactly what I did. \n\nThis is where the malicious compliance comes in. Last month, wrote an email to the entire office staff that said “I’m paying rent today.” After I was done, I took a screenshot of the thank you screen and the calendar next to each other. I then sent another email to the entire office staff with the screenshot attached. If that wasn’t enough, I sent another e-mail after the bank withdrew the money, and another saying that I was done paying rent for this month, but to expect the same thing next month, for my records, of course. This month, I did the exact same thing. \n\nPM called me and told me that sending them an e-mail for everything wasn’t necessary, but I insisted that I needed witnesses for my records that way I couldn’t get accused of falsifying again. I thanked her for her willingness to cooperate and for the wonderful idea of sending things via e-mail. Also told her that I would be doing this until I decide to move out but would gladly send them e-mails on behalf of the rest of my roommates for as long as they decide to stay there. \n\nJust as the icing on the cake, we just signed a new 14 month lease, so that means at least 14 months of e-mails from me. \n\nI also talked to corporate, who refunded me the second time I paid because the money had gone through the first time. \n\nTLDR Property manager told me I had late fees even though I had already paid rent. Told me to keep e-mail record. Now I email her and her staff every time I pay rent. \n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit 2: this got more attention than I thought, so here are some clarifications. \n\n1. PM could block my e-mail/send them to a folder/mark them as read, but if she does and something goes wrong with the apt and I try to tell her outside of MC, she could get in a lot of trouble. After all, all maintenance requests have to go through her and then go to the maintenance guys. Idk why, but it’s a small complex.\n\n2. To anyone asking why I don’t do direct deposit, it’s because they don’t offer it. I log in once a month and approve them to take money out of my account. I’d like direct deposit but maybe next complex.\n\n3. I showed her both the screenshot of the payment screen and my bank records. She didn’t believe either. I went over her head and called corporate. They gave me a full refund+late fees+ what it costs to get a cashier’s check. They also struck the late thing from my records since payment was received on time. This was confirmed by them, so roommates and I are clean. ",

        "text": "So a recent post reminded me about an essay that I wrote when i was in High School. My english teacher had the class watch a movie (I can't remember what it was anymore, its also not important for the story) and then the class would study the techniques used by the director to get across whatever themes they were trying to convey. Basically its the kind of essay that is entirely up to interpretation and you can say whatever you want as long as you can find some scene or technique to back it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the class study of the movie, the teacher made some reference to \"phallic symbols\" used throughout the movie, in the form of building shapes, or shadows in the scene, or in one particular scene an oil well. I thought this was all bullshit and decided to question the teacher as to why she believed they all had to represent phallic symbols. It got to the point where i would sarcastically ask if there was a phallic symbol in every scene just to be as annoying as i could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it came time to write the essay i knew exactly what i wanted to talk about for the majority of my essay. With that i wrote close to a page and a half about phallic symbols in this movie and how everything in the film was symbolic of a penis in one way or another. My teacher wasn't that happy with me for the essay but i had listened to everything she had said and most of the essay was just me repeating her own words back to her so i ended up getting a pretty good mark surprisingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*tl;dr High School teacher tried to convince the class that a film was full of \"phallic symbols\", so i made her read an essay about dicks.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Not sure if this actually counts as MC, but was reminded of it by a similar post",
