I've tried changing between my WiFi networks at home, turning off WiFi to use data, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and restarting my phone. NYPL doesn't seem to offer any additional solutions to troubleshoot the SimplyE app.\n\nI even tried downloading another audiobook to see if the issue was this specific book, but that one won't download either. Both audiobooks just sit at Download 0% perpetually. \n\nI was able to download a book in my audible library to test if it was my WiFi or phone, so it does seem to be limited to SimplyE.\n\nI'll be on a long-ish road trip tomorrow and would like to continue the story while driving, so any help getting the audiobook to work would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "So I haven't see hardly any posts about this book and mainly reviews on goodreads. I get it though for any who read this book, it( spoilers) contains both direct and indirect scenes of child molestation. The author is a psychiatric nurse practitioner with experience working with traumatized children. Glad she wrote it even if it is disgusting, because it gives you both first and third person povs of grooming, cultists, and isolation.\n\nSo to start, the story is set on an island where a community of 10 families, the adult men or \"ancestors\" as they're called, create this community. Even before building their own homes, they build a church and have their own bible that they just call \"our book\". Generations later the community has grown and strongly adheres to the rules laid out by the ancestors and their history. The story goes that war, disease, an enternal fire burns in the wasteland or what is supposedly left of civilization. \n\nNo one leaves the island to the wasteland except for the \"wanderers\", who are just the descendants of the original 10 ancestors. They typically bring back some matetials, animals occaisionally, and even other families from the wastelands. They also enforce the rules of their community and unamed religion. Here i will say like many who've either read the book or seen reviews, this is comparable to both the village and never let me go in its theme of the outside world being ambiguous.\n\nSo let's get to the main theme an spoiler alert, if you can't stomach child abuse, sexual abuse, patriarchy, and other things maybe take a few deep breaths beforehand. \n\nSo life on the island is like this. Theres no electricity, running water, or modern technology except for a few things like clocks that run off gears and cogs or books aside from the main religious book. Everything is agrarian, each man has a specialty they work in be it farming, smelting, tanning, brewing, etc. Wives do all the house work for the most part and kids go to school, run around playing, or help their parents. Girls and other kids experience summer where they run wild like animals doing whatever they want with no parental supervision on the island. All the houses do leave food out for these kids on their porch. When this summer ends there is another summer when girls of age or once they had their first period will have their summer of fruition as they call it.\n\nThe summer of fruition is when these girls will spend nights at different houses having sex with older boys i wanna say late teens to early 20s. These girls are usually in their early teens. Before any of this, girls are already being molested by their fathers until they have their first period, this is bc daughters are expected to take the role of a wife at a certain point and comfort their fathers. Now let me say, this is normalized but not all of them are ok with and as you get through more of the story, we see more girls start realizing its wrong. \n\nEven when these girls get pregnant later on after their summer of fruition and are married to the boys they choose, they realise that that having a daughter is terrible bc they'll go through what they went through. Another issue is at this period in the book there is quite a lot of \"defectives\" or babies born horribly deformed, most likely having to do with all the inbreeding over the years. On top of this familes can only have 2 children each, I imagine a 3rd would be killed by the wanderers to keep the population down. Also once a couple has reached their prime and outlived their usefulness, they take the \"final draft\" which is some koolaid I imagine that kills them. Keep in mind someone in their late 20s amongst this community is considered elderly, so someone in their 30s is probably a geezer.\n\nBack to the girls, once a girl is married she becomes a woman and from then on aside from giving birth, raising, children, and mainly being a stay at home wife they dont really have much freedom aside from preparing the next generation of daughters. Women also arent allowed to congregate in public or anywhere if its more than 3 of them without a male chaperone. They are taught how to read but mainly just know \"our book\". Women and girls included who speak to a man on alone thats not their husband or relative are shamed publicly, typically given lashes via whip. The man who spoke to them is also shamed. \n\nIts really screwed up bc daughters at a certain age and it can vary allow their dads to sleep with them bc its their duty. This also causes some mothers to resent their daughters. Anyway, the story revolves around several girls, one of them their father is wanderer, and she has access to books from the wasteland. Things like this are typically forbidden but her father allows her to read certain ones that won't provide any info on what the wastelands are actually like. She has read the call of the wild quite a bit. Another girl us starving herself so she doesnt hit puberty and most other kids are scared of her including other adults and her parents. One girl early on who is friends with the starving girl starts considering finding a way to leave the island and pushes the idea that maybe the wastelands arent actually what they've been told. \n\nThis leads to a major plot where one of the girls who has a physically abusive father and her family came from the wastelands when she was young, sees the murder of the girl who pushed the idea about leaving the island. Ofc this is done clandestine by the wanderers. This leads to the starving girl once finding out to start having secret meeting at the church at night with the other girls about basically rebelling against their parents and questioning their way of life and the wastelands. She soon gathers the girls to sleep in a group near the shore and not going home except to steal supplies from home.\n\nOver time the wanderers start taking action by taking these girls or at least the ones who they catch to their parents to be punished. Some more girls die, and the reason given is they bled out but the body is never seen even by their parents. This sparks more rebellion and eventually they take the starving girl and publicly beat her, causing more issues. Btw, the wanderers daughter never stayed out in rebellion so she was ok. \n\nAs things go on, a new family joins from the wastelands, its a couple. The man is kinda creepy and his wife pregnant. We get the sense obviously he chose to come to this way of life bc he like the ancestors is a pedo/predator. He is invited over to the wanderers daughters home for dinner. He comes alone, says his wife is sick. As the daughter's parents talk to him, she asks questions about the wasteland and what life is like there. This is forbbiden aside from wanderers to have any info about the wastelands. A bit later as she is showing him her fathers library, he starts to get rapey but her moms sees them alone there before anything happens. Once he leaves, the parents are aware of his behavior and decide to act with caution going foward.\n\nNot too long after as the other daughters are still rebelling, they realize no adults are outside during they day. Turns out a disease is effecting everyone and a lot of the population dies. The wanderers daughter and his family are one of a good handful of the population who survive bc he got some medicine from the wasteland and gives it to them. The new guy whobgot rapey comes to the wanderers house where he got rapey with his daughter to actually finish the job when shes on her own. He is drunk and tells her that his wife died from the disease. He also talks to her about how what fathers do to their daughters is wrong on the island but she confuses this for the medicine she received. He talks about now he doesnt have to wait years to basically bang his own kid. As hes about to rape her, she thinks quick, breaks the window to her room, and cuts the guy with glass, her dad happens to show up then and KOs him with a log.\n\nAfter this she is kinda of traumitized and the disease has dwindled. With so much of the population having died out, the wanderers gather and start talking about bringing more families from the wasteland due to the disease and bc of all the inbreeding over generations they need new blood. Over time the starving girl dies of well starvation, another girl whose mom died due to disease and was originally from the wasteland from self drowning. \n\nAt the end the wanderers daughter and her family actually leave the island bc he was afraid the other wanderers were going to come after his books bu moreso his daughter. They leave via boat and as they reach the shore of the wasteland, from the daughter's pov view we are left with the image of either people burning or their shadows being cast by the sun.\n\nMy thoughts: So I thought it was an interesting book to touch on such dark subjects especially in these times. I can't say I'm happy with the ending but then again the author made it ambiguous to begin with. If you have any questions to discuss, I can provide you all the other details I didn't cover about it.",

        "text": "Could you *be* any more delusional and self-serving as this man? I loved him in *Friends* and for a long time was feeling very sympathetic towards him and his struggles, addiction can get to the best of people and I do admire those who keep fighting. But this book was something else. A blatant lack of self-awareness, narcissism and inflated ego was just too much. \n\nThis is the man, who admits he cheated on basically each of his girlfriends, yet at the same time thinks \"he's a very good person, he would never hurt anyone God can see this\".\n\nThis is the man who hurt and drove away those who helped him the most, those who spent months with him in hospitals and rehabs, risking their careers and private lives, and suddenly were disposable when he was discharged because \"as long as I'm sober, I don't need them any more and now they're needy\". \n\nThis is the man who constantly shits on every person more successful than him. Who thinks that every bad thing that happened to him must be the fault of someone else. That he's not even in the slightest responsible for how his life looks like, because \"it's a disease, and you're lucky you don't have it, woe is me, I don't have any control over it\". Who destroyed so many movies because of his addiction, and once just disappeared for 6 months during the production to go on a binge and later detox, and is in absolute shock they sued him for financial loses. \"How could they, it was health issue??\". Who hurt every woman he's every been with, but when his ex (!) informs him she's getting married and won't be able to attend his play he says \"her emailing me about it is the worst thing someone has done to me, I would NEVER do that to a person, how could she\". The whole book is just constant self-serving \"me, myself and I, why everyone around me is always wrong and why all I did to myself and other people is not my fault\". I was physically ill by the end of this book. \n\nThe narcissism is so obvious it's not even funny. Early in his career his supposed friend rejected role of Chandler, which he obviously later regretted seeing how it played out for Matthew. What Perry has to say about it? He just randomly quotes a journalist saying that it was a blessing to the world it was Perry who was cast and that his friend would be a shitty Chandler anyway. Who the hell would do something like that to a friend? Did you just kept this quote memorized for 20+ years or went out of your way to locate any negative comment about your friend to include this in your memoir? Absolutely shocking. More on narcissism - he writes his first play in 10 days and self proclaims it as \"great work better than classics\" and gets all annoyed that it was demolished by critics. Did it ever occur to him that maybe it wasn't that good and he could work on it more? Of course not, critics just don't understand his genius, and besides, here's one semi-positive review he found - proceeds to quote it in its entirety. Yes, quoting passages praising Matthew Perry takes quite big portion of this book.\n\nAs for his addiction, this is something that happens to him against his will, he would love to trade places even with homeless or broke people, they don't get how hard he got it in life with his addicted brain. He'd love to stop, but when even the slightest hardship happens in his life, he just has to drink or use. It's just how his body works, not his fault, you're lucky if you don't have this disease. People who overcame addiction? Oh, they had it easy, easier version, easier to overcome, lucky bastards. He's one of the few that got the hardest version and he's a hero for living with it every day.\n\nI could go on, but let's stop here. If this was a work of fiction, I'm certain people would find it almost unbelievable. You can't be that dense and oblivious to all of your faults, this is just bad writing. But here we are - the person who carefully made sure to only surround himself with yes-men is unable to see or admit he is the only constant in every situation that he messed up. What a surprise. Good luck with sobriety with the attitude of constant whining and looking for others to blame, you'll need that, Matthew.",

        "text": "As I was perusing eBay to see if anyone was selling merch of a certain book series I liked, I saw two listings for the advanced reader's copy/galley of the new latest installment of the series that's coming out in *May*. I know the author as of recent has been trying to drum up support for their newest release by hosting a few giveaways and contests for these ARC's, so that some fans could read them months before release, and I suspect that maybe two of these recipients has decided to put their ARC's up for sale (auction, actually). \n\nI know selling ARC's are technically legal, but it seems a bit scummy to sell them before the book has even *released*. I don't know if I should message the author on social media and let them know if this is happening because on the one hand I feel it would be right to inform them that this is happening and to be wary of it in the future, but on the other hand it would be discouraging and disappointing to see, maybe they'd stop hosting these contests entirely, and, as someone still in the shallows of book collecting/reader/writer sphere, I'm not sure if this is \"worth\" bringing up to them at all?  \n\nAny input is appreciated, I just found it really sad to see these ARC's going up for sale months before they actually should.",

Some of the reviews in Goodreads seemed not to like it and, at first, I was so thrown-off by the bizarre writing style that I felt where they were coming from, but it really grew on me. \n\nThe characters, storyline, and themes were all great- really loved the ending - but I guess I'm still not sure why he chose to write it the way he did. Any insight? Like I said, I liked the style it by the end, but I am wondering if I missed some major benefit or flare it added to the story, or if he just did it because he felt like it.\n\nAlso can we talk about what happened to &gt;!the Reverend?! I am assuming he was saved in the end because he sacrificed himself for Willie but how can we be sure?!  I was really hoping for at least an extra line of Rev. seeing the light at the end of the tunnel or something, but now!&lt; I might stress about it for the rest of my life :')",

Each page was a type of maze / puzzle that was disguised within elaborate and beautiful pictures.  You followed a pretty simple narrative in which you were on an adventure of some sort trying to hunt something / someone down or find a certain location.  Some of the mazes had special rules or puzzles that you had to overcome to complete them.  The main character(s) may have been a duo and may have been animals but I‚Äôm not sure.\n\nThe closest thing I‚Äôve been able to find is the ‚ÄúPierre Maze Detective‚Äù series but it‚Äôs not as good.\n\nI‚Äôve been searching for years and going into book stores and googling, but no one can ever help.

Since it's a short read, he read it in less than a week. He gave it to me to read and said we'd talk about it when I was finished. I was disappointed. We both had very similar opinions about it overall.\n\nIt was OK, but 1st, the characters weren't very likable. Also, it's confusing why those characters were even friends at all. None of them seemed to get along good from the start! Everyone seemed they were just tolerating each other. 2nd, the book should have definitely been longer. The author was cramming so much information and bits of backstory that should have been dug into more. I wish we could've explored more on Cat's backstory and the relationships between these \"friends\". \n\nI'm not sure if anyone else also felt this way, but was anyone else confused about who was with who at times? It seemed like everyone had an intimate relationship with each other at one point except Lin. At the beginning of the book, I was even confused about who the groom was. Just the way some things were worded made me think \"wait is he brother or groom? When did this relationship end?\"\n\nOverall, I would like to hear others' opinions on this short read. After looking up the book, I noticed many poor reviews left, and it had an average score of 3.2/5. Have you read any of the authors' other books? Do you recommend any better books?",

        "text": "As a reader, I'm always on the lookout for books that will leave a lasting impression on me. Recently, I've been reflecting on the books that have had the biggest impact on my life, and one that immediately comes to mind is \"Magician\" by Raymond E. Feist.\n\nI read \"Magician\" when I was about 13 years old, that is some 34 years ago.  The story of a young boy named Pug who discovers his magical abilities and becomes embroiled in a dangerous conflict between two worlds captured my imagination and took me on a journey that I'll never forget.\n\n\nMoreover, \"Magician\" sparked my love for literature and motivated me to read more books in fantasy and in all genres. I went on to read the entire \"Riftwar Saga\" series and many other fantasy books, which broadened my horizons and introduced me to new worlds and ideas.\n\nIt's amazing how words on a page can have such an impact on our lives, and I'm grateful for the experience of reading this book.\n\nSo, what book has had the biggest impact on your life, and how has it influenced you? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences.",

        "text": "\"This book is probably five years old or less, at most it may be 10 years old.\"\n\n\"There was some kind of a research lab, and there was an accident. The accident inadvertently created some kind of mutated monster, or series of monsters. Meanwhile, or possibly, because of that, there was a kind of general apocalypse in the world, the crux was that the protagonist(s) had to hole up in a cabin up in the mountains, and basically hide from the world, and they have done so for 1? 2?? generations. the protagonists were a small group that I believe included one or two kids. Offspring of the originals?? Eventually they had to come down from the cabin either to confront the bad guy monsters, which, eventually they did, but also because they were basically running out of either supplies or something important that they needed. So it has been either 90 years or 100 years or something since the original people had holed up in the cabin, and the world of course was devastated by whatever.\"\n\nRing a bell for anyone?",

Psycho Pass is another anime that feels like an adaption of a pre-existing novel.\n\nThere are also some movies, video games, etc. that I wish so badly I could read as a novel adaption written by my favorite authors. I was really disappointed in the Assassin's Creed novelizations because the writing just didn't do it for me, for whatever reason. I think Dishonored would make a fantastic novel series.\n\nA friend of mine wrote a fanfic novelization based on the Azure Moon route of Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Personally I think games like FE3H are best experienced that way because of the CYOA nature of the story and all the relationship possibilities. However, a lot of the fanfic that it rendered really do give published authors a run for their money.\n\nWhat are other such examples you think could be better experienced through another storytelling medium than its original?",

I shared that family may be visiting a coastal Mexican family resort later this year (like Cabo or Puerto Vallarta) and my parents on the phone immediately panic and regurgitate a story on one of their local news stations (Fox or Sinclair affiliated stations) about some murder or kidnapping. It's a frustratingly familiar pattern where individual \"news\" anecdotes have built in them a mindset that the world is a dangerous place.   I don't delude myself into thinking I'll change them, but it got me really curious about the history of broadcast news media in the United States and how it has changed over the past six decades. \n\nI recently read Elizabeth Williamson's Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth (highly recommended), but I'm hoping to discover some reading material that focuses less on internet-borne misinformation and disinformation, and focuses more on how broadcast news media has evolved (for better or worse) and explores its role in an era of misinformation, disinformation, and regional and national politics.\n\nNever posted here before, so apologies if the spiel was a bit too much!",

        "text": "I'd love to get some insights from people who have run a book club before and what they did in this situation. I hear lots of tips about starting a new group, but no attention for what to do at the end of a book club.\n\nIt's the usual story - people's lives are getting busy. It's a diverse group in terms of age (20s to 60s).\n\nI've been facilitating the book club for six years. We meet monthly, previously only in-person. During the pandemic, we switched to Zoom-only, then a year and a half ago to hybrid mode (Zoom option along with in-person when there's enough people showing up). Attendance has been dropping, especially for in-person, but sometimes we'll get a good-sized group and it'll feel like old times. We have about a dozen regulars and a good-sized meeting can be 6-10 people. But sometimes it'll just be 3 people.\n\nI'm getting super busy and am not enjoying it as much as I used to. I'm rushing through the books and getting frustrated with the admin side of planning (finding good dates, not hearing opinions). The group is open to new membership but I don't have the energy to look for new members.\n\nThere's no obvious candidates to take on book club planning. (I haven't straight up asked yet, but I'm pretty sure this is the case.)\n\nWe still enjoy each other's company! I'm torn since I think we could get to a decade (or more?!?) of book clubbing, laughing, and inside jokes. We have lots of fun together, but possibly nothing would happen if I didn't take charge.\n\nI'm thinking of just planning meetings every 2 months since 6x/year seems way more doable to me than 12x/year. And then evaluating next year if I still have the energy for this. I'll be sad if it does end, but I never envisioned the end of the book club when we first started.\n\nIf I/we choose not to continue... does anyone have some fun end activities ideas? What have other book club organizers done?",

Then one day an immigrant worker (i think from Ukraine) who is of legal age thinks that she too is of legal age and with his not so good english talks to her but the girl does not have the heart to correct him as he seems her type and is very caring about her and is handsome. She even confides in him about her crooked long nose but he says that his favourite feature about her is her long straight nose. Her relationship with her mum meanwhile improves and her best friend will keep on insisting her to inform him about her real age. One day she would tell him and he being shocked would immediately stop talking to her. She goes on with her life and after some years she would have nearly forgotten about the boy and she would see him with another girl and he would be smiling at his new girlfriend. Our protagonist would think she would get jealous, angry or sad but she would feel nothing but peace and gratefulness for him to have entered her life when she most needed it and would move on with her life.\n\nThis is all I remember of the story but I greatly remember it for its ending and instances of his care when he was in a relationship with her.

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI remember a beautiful picture book I got as a child from a school book fair. It was a large hardcover about a young red dragon named Igneous (95% sure this is the right name) going on a bit of a solo adventure in nature. I have vivid but maybe incorrect memories of some of the gorgeous illustrations: bird's eye view of the dragon flying above a forest and a nighttime forest scene with maybe a few woodland creatures, maybe a rocky dragon canyon. They were very sophisticated beautiful illustrations, definitely traditionally made probably painted or with aquarelle. I am aprofessional illustrator now so those childhood picture books are very nostalgic! I've looked this book up periodically for years without a trace. Anyone know it? I thought it was called Igneous and maybe had him on the cover in a rocky environment.",
