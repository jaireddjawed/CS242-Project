        "text": "So I just got off a 12-hour flight today, after an exhausting three days of nonstop walking and talking, besides which I had a moderate flu as well. Everyone on the plane seemed to be in the same boat as me, and it’s a small plane, barely had about a 100 people in it.\n\nSince the plane was so small, I could recognize many of the passengers beside me and in the terminal. This one woman, traveling with two kids and an older teenage daughter (maybe 16-18), seemed particularly stressed out. The kids behaved reasonably well, there was very little screaming or crying from the two little ones, and the older daughter seemed to be managing the younger ones quite well. I quite liked this family, until we got to immigration.\n\nThe line at the immigration counter was slow and painful, especially in my zombie-like state. The single mom family was in front of me in the line. I was happily daydreaming until there was a loud-ass yell from in front of me: “SON!! WHY IS THERE A THREAD HANGING FROM YOUR POCKET?!?”\n\nYes I thought I dreamt that line as well.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a half-dead maybe 6 year old kid, who was perfectly well-behaved through the entire flight. The last thing he would care about is a small thread hanging from the pocket on his butt. But no, this woman keeps yelling at him, at a volume louder than the engines on the plane we were on: “I CANT BELIEVE YOU TRAVELED ALL THE WAY FROM HOME LIKE THAT, HOW DISGRACEFUL!! PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE POOR!! YOU ARE ALL HORRIBLE CHILDREN I DON’T KNOW WHAT I DID TO SUFFER WITH KIDS LIKE YOU!”\n\nThen she literally sets her shit on the floor next to her, opens her huge carry-on and starts rummaging for a damn scissor to cut this tiny thread. Everyone behind her is getting pissed off, cause we’re all tired and she’s holding up the line and not letting anyone else go through. We all just stood there like sheep until she was done yelling and cutting the damnation thread off.\n\nI mean, if you’re so worried about your kids’ cleanliness, why not actually look them over yourself instead of having a screaming fit in the middle of a line full of people who really don’t have time for your shit?\n\nProbably not relevant to this sub but I needed to  rant, cause she made my time at the airport AT LEAST fifteen minutes longer than it needed to be\n\nAnd the poor teenage daughter kept trying to fix   the situation too, first by trying to calm her mom down, then slowly trying to get her to the side of the line so the other people could at least pass through, while mombitch kept yelling about her horrible kids for all the world to hear. Finally gave up on her mom and just stood to the back comforting the youngest kid, who was obviously freaked out by all the yelling, while also profusely apologizing to everyone stuck in the line. Mom doesn’t deserve this daughter.",

Although we had a reservation, it was clear from the get-go that they weren't ready for us. It took a long while to get the table ready, set up water, etc. Whatever. It's a big group. We had blocked two hours off the schedule, anticipating a bit of a wait. There were only a couple servers working, but the place was completely empty, so shouldn't be too bad.\n\nMaybe the emptiness should have been a clue.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait, someone came out to take our orders. He seemed to be struggling a bit to understand the orders, and it took a while, but hey, food's on the way. All good.\n\n30 minutes later, no food. (It'll be out shortly.)\n60 minutes later, no food. (Just a few more minutes.)\n\nYeah, we should have left. But we'd really looked forward to this particular silly team outing after some tough deadlines. We just didn't want to give up. And we were dumb.\n \n90 minutes later, the food started arriving.\n\nOne plate of Hawaiian BBQ ribs. Good.\nTwo plates of pork fried rice. Uh, who ordered the second?\nThree plates of coconut shrimp. Three?\nFour orders of chicken and peanut sauce. WTF?\nFive crab rangoon...\n\nBy the time we got to ten pupu platters, we figured out the server had prefixed each order with a number, as in #1, #2, etc... and the kitchen had read that as the number of orders to make of that dish.\n\nWell, at least we didn't leave hungry. \n\n(And no, they didn't charge us for the ridiculous amount of food served in error.)",

        "text": "Kind of long, but this happened maybe 4 years ago in a department store that sells clothing, shoes, and housewares.\n\nI was about to head out of town for a trip to an indoor water park with my four kids and husband, and while wrapping up our packing the morning before departure, I realized that all three of our girls had outgrown their swimsuits and my son had outgrown his water shoes. I headed to the store to pick up these items to complete my packing before my then 7 year old daughter and 5 year old son got out of school, and my husband was going to tackle swimwear for my 9 year old stepdaughter on his way back from picking her up from her mother. I had my 3 year old little girl with me that didn’t know how to keep her shit together in public at the time, so I went in the store with a list, a plan, and a cup of Cheerios to keep the little heathen calm. It should have been a 15-20 minute outing.\n\nWe started in the children’s department, and I located the girls swimwear immediately and grabbed a suit for my 7yo, then a few paces away we found the toddlers swimwear and got a suit for the little one. I shoved the stroller across the store to the shoes and grabbed some water shoes for the boy, and 10 minutes in... we were ready to check out with roughly a handful of Cheerios remaining in the cup.\n\nThe line at checkout was long, and I figured she’d run out of snacks and begin whining and thrashing about to try and escape the stroller, so I hoped it would move quickly. I noticed that anyone not paying with their “department store card” was filling out an application while the line continued to queue, but I remained patient until it was my turn.\n\nFinally, I’m up at the register. I will be Me, persistent cashier will be PC. My beautiful hell-spawn of a 3yo will be BH.\n\nPC: Thank you for shopping “department store”! Will you be paying with you “department store credit card” today?\n\nMe: (as BH begins screeching “more cereal!”) No thank you. Just debit, please.\n\nPC: You know you can save 15% on today’s purchases just for applying, and you get an additional 10% off when it comes back approved! That’s 25% off your total purchases!\n\nBH: *flops around from side to side in attempt to capsize the stroller*.\n\nMe: I’m not interested. Thanks.\n\nPC: You’re not interested in saving at least 15% by taking 5 minutes to apply?\n\nBH: *now shrieking*. OUT! OUT! Let me OUTTTTT! *thrashes around like she needs an exorcism*\n\nMe: Not that it’s any of your business, but my credit is shit, I don’t want an inquiry for a card I will get rejected for and won’t use. I just want these things, and I want to pay with money I already have, NOT CREDIT.\n\nPC: (undeterred) Just think of how many more things you can buy for your daughter today with the savings. You get 15% just for applying, so even if your credit is bad, you still save today!\n\nBH: *begins grabbing at all the impulse racks to brace herself for another wild attempt at escaping the stroller*. OUTTTT!!! OUT! OUT! OUT!\n\nMe: Just tell me my total so I can leave. I really just want to get this child out of the store.\n\nPC: Today’s purchase comes to $100.58. You are paying over $15 more than necessary. \n\nMe: *silently slides debit card through reader and prepares to enter my pin code and escape*.\n\nPC: Oh! Since your debit card carries the visa logo, we can use the information from your swipe to populate most of the application. Just enter your social security number and telephone number and I can have a response in under a minute and get you that 15% in savings!\n\nBH: *now red-faced from straining, I have removed her and am holding her on my hip as she tugs at my hair and wipes snot on me, because she was about to break the damn stroller*. Eye! Eye! *And she’s poking me in the eye with snotty fingers*.\n\nMe: No. Just process the card I swiped and give me my receipt.\n\nPC: *into a radio*... I need a key turn. I hit the card application key on the customer’s swipe, and she’s changed her mind and just wants to pay and leave. How do I back out of this?\n\nMe: I didn’t CHANGE MY MIND! I said NO repeatedly!\n\nPC: *ignores me and the 30lbs of snotty screaming child on my hip*. If you just enter the info on the screen it will go faster.\n\nMe: For the love of GOD, NO! *sets heavy ass kid down, and she immediately flails about on the floor like a fish out of water*.\n\nPC: *hits one button without any guidance from whoever was on the radio with her, and the screen switches from asking for my ssn to asking for a card swipe again*. Ok, it’s ready for you to swipe for $100.58, which is about $15 more than what you would be spending if we had finished it the other way.\n\nMe: *enters pin code, while hoisting my child back onto my hip and getting jabbed up my nose by snotty fingers*. Thanks, receipt please?\n\nPC: *Cheerily says to the back of my head as I’m dragging a stroller and bag with one hand and holding my kid with the other*... Maybe next time you can shop while your daughter is with the grandparents, and we can finish that application and save you some money!\n\nMe: *turns, sets screaming child on the ground again, because I’ve fucking had enough*... Her grandparents all died before she was born. Thanks for reminding me! *and out the door we went*\n\nBH: *having exorcised her demons on the floor of the department store, returns to the adorable angel she was literally everywhere except public*... Hey mommy, can I see my new bavin’ soup (bathing suit)? Why did that lady make you say sad stuff about dead people?\n\nI emailed their corporate offices and got a canned response and a fucking 15% off coupon that I never used, because I have not set foot back in that store since. BH has, however, learned how to keep her shit together in public these days... so there’s that.\n\nTL;DR: Cashier lady tries to force me to apply for a credit card while my child is actively engaged in a demon possession/exorcism on the floor in front of the register.",

Waiting in line to return barstools at generic bigbox store in the USA. I live in a very small town with another big box store that is currently closed down. I actually worked the closing as the front end service desk manager. This is important. \n\nSo.. waiting in line to return a box of bar stools and this older lady walks up in front of me. I know the CSM she’s just broken me in line to get to, and both of these ladies recognize me from when i was at the closed store. \n\nOld lady says “oh, i just have a question hon.” And puts her hand up to me and the other customers who have been patiently waiting. \n\nI immediately said “great, and i JUST have a return and these people likely JUST have questions and returns of their own. Get in line.” And i moved my cart right in front of her. \n\nShe continued to try to talk so i just talked right over her and said “hi how are ya (manager), long time no see! I’d just like to see if i could exchange these as there are pieces missing.” \n\nAnd she ignores the old lady and all was right in the world as she slinked to the back of the line. Im aware that i was rude in doing this, but i have seen my fair share of people who wait in line only to be broken and it makes me so dang mad. Wait in line. That’s what the rope is there for. As a former CSM myself i feel like it’s officially my duty as a customer to stand up to these line breakers. It is so dang rude. I’m sorry you’re 86 years old but I’ve waited in line to get my own question answered so you can too. It’s annoying. ",

        "text": "Hi I'm a first time poster on this sub but had quite the experience the other day that I thought you guys might enjoy reading about. I apologize in advance for grammar\n\nSome background before I get into anything:\n\nI work in the wine industry in a tasting room. I work in an area where we have over 50 tasting rooms and about over 30 in just the downtown area. The wine industry people here are very nice to each other. I get industry discounts which means I can get free tastings. Recently on my lunch breaks ill walk to a tasting room in town and bring 2 for 1 coupons that they can pass out to their customers in exchange for a stack of their 2 for 1 cards. Its great I get to network try new wines that I can recommend to my clients. You get the point.\n\nSo I decided to taste where Iv heard the man running it is.. not as friendly. None of my coworkers have been and none of the other tasters from other rooms that I have talked to have gone. So I decided to take one for the team out of my own curiosity.\n\nSo I grab my business cards, 2 for 1 cards, and some cash to tip and walked across the street in to the tasting room.\n\nI'm greeted by an older man who is the owner of the shop. \n\n&gt;Him: Hello what can I help you with?\n\n&gt;Me: Hi I work across the street at [Winery] and have never been in here before and wanted to try your wines! Do you comp tastings for industry?\n\n&gt;Him: Yeah I can do that for you\n\nSo far so good. Seems like a very nice man\n\n&gt;Me: Wonderful thank you! I also brought a stack of our 2 for 1's from [Winery] and wanted to bring back a stack from you guys if you guys do the 2 for 1's as well.\n \nI had barely pulled the stack of cards out of my pocket before this man attitude completely flipped. He began YELLING at me.\n\n&gt; Him: I will never do 2 for 1's for my business I think they are the worst thing this industry as done. I refuse to make them for MY business let alone pass out any for any other business.\n\nI'm completely in shock at this point\n\n&gt;Me: ....okay\n\n&gt;Him: Those are such a waste of money you would have to be STUPID to give those out to people I would never accept any kind of coupon like that.\n\n&gt;Me: okay\n\nAt this point my head is just racing. Is this man really yelling at me? I cant really \"fight\" back I'm representing the Winery I work for. Do I walk away? Do I try to steer the conversation in a different direction? Chang the topic? More importantly WHY IS HE SO ANGRY?!\n\n&gt;Him: Tell me do those actually make you money?\n\n&gt;Me: Well-\n\n&gt;Him: How many people who use those ACTUALLY end up buying a bottle of wine ? huh? You loose more money then you do gain anything from them. \n\n&gt; Me: We.. get new clients in with those\n\n&gt; Him: Yeah well how many actually come back after or sign up for the club? (wine club)\n\nAt this point I realized It wasn't worth trying to defend since he seems like just an overall angry man. I then pointed at the tasting list and asked about the wines and he completely changed attitudes and we began talking about the wines. I stayed and tasted and he never brought up the 2 for 1's though he did criticized where I parked. (idk y 2)\n\nI thanked him and left with out tipping and carried on with my day. I told my experience with my coworkers, owners and winemaker and they where all shocked by this guys behavior but they also noted that they too have heard he was a not so nice guy. My manager told me that shes had customers who have come in after tasting over there and have said that he was a rude grumpy old man. So safe to say I wont be sending any one over there.\n\nPart of me kinda feels bad for him. He seems just like an unhappy old man. ",

Last week, I was checking out at the grocery store and the cashier (who had been kind of slow and difficult to understanding, mumbling low and slow with her face downward so I couldn't hear), asked if I would like to donate a dollar to some summer camp.  \n\nCool, whatever, not a big deal.  \n\n\"No thanks,\" I say figuring that's it.  I had only bought maybe a half dozen items, we were done ringing them up, it was on my way home from work, I'm tired and stressed and the store is busy and I'm just wanting to pay and go home.\n\nInstead, she decides she needs to ask me 4 more times, guilt tripping me, telling me it's only a dollar, surely I could spare a dollar, they're almost at their goal, one dollar would really go a long way, yadda yadda.  The whole time, speaking barely above a mumbled whisper, not looking at me, just sort of fazed out and ignoring me as I keep saying no.  \n\nI laughed a bit the first couple times I said no, again whatever.  But dang, by the end, I didn't even know what to say anymore.  I finally just shoved my card in the card reader and stopped responding.  She hit a couple buttons and told me I had to take the card out and do it again.  \n\nI made sure to check my receipt and luckily no charge.  But dang, lady.  I know you've been pressed to ask for the donation, but take a hint.  ",

A store on the corner of small and untidy was having an online only sale where it made it much cheaper to shop online.  I don’t tend to shop online for this kinda stuff but I thought screw it.  It says I can return items to the store if I don’t want them.  So I purchased 4 or 5 small hair care items.   \n\nI ended up needing to return all of them.  All were unopened.  I discovered the curly girl method in the meantime and none of the products were on the approved list. Anywho. \n\nI enter the store at the corner of judgmental  and understaffed.  I get in line and my turn comes up.  I place the opened box with items and  packing list on the counter.  The cashier (C) snatched the packing list.  She’s maybe in her mid to late 50s.\n\nNote: the hair care items are individually shrink wrapped so it’s obvious I haven’t used them.\n\nC: Huff.  Smacking the paper “what’s *this*?”\n\nMe: “oh.  It’s the packing list/receipt for the items I bought online.  I just need to return them”.\n\nC: bigger huff.  Starts inspecting my items and the list. “Well what am I supposed to do with these?” Obviously annoyed.\n\nMe:  how the fuck should I know.  What I actually say “it said I could return items from online to the store”.  I’m actually worried I misread the return policy.\n\nC: calls supervisor over\n\nMeanwhile a huge line is forming.  I’m feeling embarrassed and dumb.\n\nSupervisor (S) shows up and tells me to move over to a different register.\n\nI explain the situation.\n\nS:  “you’re returning *all* the items?”  Like I purposefully did it just to fuck with them.\n\nMe: “yes” feeling even more like an asshole as this point and am planning my move to another country.  \n\nS starts hitting some buttons and doing stuff.  I can tell he’s getting frustrated by the whole thing.  Clearly no one has any idea how to return an online order.  He starts picking up my items one by one.\n\n“You’re returning *this*?”  It was hair clip I bought to put me over the amount needed for free shipping.  Stares at me waiting for an answer. \n\nMe: “yes” at this point my embarrassment is turning to anger.  I’ve been really apologetic up to this point.  I understand that this probably doesn’t happen often so it’s a bit of scramble. My patience is starting to wear very thin.\n\nS realizes he has no idea what he’s doing and calls over the store manager(M).\n\nS explains to M in a somewhat snide way what’s going on.  M smiles and apologies for the hassle.  I’m again asked about returning everything with some attitude but he gets it done.  \n\nI leave and never return to that store ever again.  In fact I still actively avoid the entire chain unless absolutely necessary.",

        "text": "I had been selling books, hundreds, online so I went to this place you ship from quite often over several weeks. There were only two employees (both older gentlemen) there in the evenings when I went and we'd chat and such while they were getting everything entered, so we had a nice rapport going.\n\nThe next to last time that I went, I was running late and I had hurt my leg earlier that day so I was in a fair bit of pain and had a bad limp. I had 7 large boxes of books and a few various sized envelopes. I'm trying to get everything into the lobby, dropping things because I'm rushing so I don't make them stay late, and they just stand there watching. Not very polite, but whatever.\n\nI finally get all of the packages inside. About 3 of the big boxes and all of the smaller packages we're ready to go, so I got in line and started working on the others while I waited. There wasn't anyone in front of me so it wasn't very long before one of the employees finished with the customer they were helping and called me over.\n\nI had separated the ready packages from the others and let him know that he could start and by the time those were finished the rest would be ready. Keep in mind, I've been doing this for weeks, I know how long the process takes and he knows that I know this as he recognizes and comments on how much I have this time versus other times. He agrees and is about to start working on it when the other employee whispers to the guy helping me, \"Hey look, there is that girl you like to flirt with.\" He looks up, sees her just as she's walking in, looks back at me and says, \"I'm sorry, I'm going to need all of these ready before I can start,\" then proceeds to yell, \"There you are beautiful, come on up here!\"\n\nI look at him in disbelief and tell him that by the time he gets to the ones that aren't yet ready, they will be, but he ignores me to talk to this lady that's probably 40 years younger than him and they both ignore me as I move all of my packages to the side.\n\nI'm pretty frustrated at this point, but I just get everything boxed up as quickly as I can and then the other guy is ready. I lug everything over to the opposite side of the counter and he starts. He's looking through everything and says, \"I'm going to need you to step to the side and write the addresses on all of these boxes before we can start.\" I'm thinking that this has to be some kind of joke but he at stands there. I say, \"Are you serious? You print labels and cover the addresses any way, this is a waste of time.\" But he won't back down, despite this being something that I do on occasion. The guy I started out with chimes in and says, \"Don't worry, we've got all night!\"\n\nI quickly escalated from frustrated to downright angry. I've been here for 20 minutes, I'm in pain, and these guys are being jerks. So I sit there writing everything out, steam probably rolling out of my ears. When I'm finally finished the place has already closed and I end up back with the guy I started with. He starts trying to talk and joke with me like everything is all good and I just stare at him...I literally cannot believe what's happening. He has the decency to look at least a little ashamed and asks if everything is alright. I tell him that it's not and just stare at him with a look of fury. It was enough to shut him for the rest of the transaction. ",

Would you have tipped or no? I normally tip like 20% but I was just frustrated because of the shit service I got over the phone.\n",

        "text": "Obligatory Disclaimer: Happened about 4 years ago\n\nThis happened roughly 4 years ago. My friend, his family, myself, and my family decided to go shopping together. Now, my friend and I are both 18 and legal adults, and this is important later on. My friend and I decided we we’re going to go for a walk around the stores of the outskirts of the mall plaza, roughly a 5 min walk from the Red Circles store our families were at. In the outskirts of the plaza there are about 8 or 9 other stores. In order, since its important, there was Schticks, Floormart, a hair cutting place, a 6 Up store and Dock 2 Exports, and a restuarant. \n\nMy friend and I decided we were going to go into Schticks since he needed a new basketball. We got about 5 feet in and there was a group of employees there, I’d say 4 or 5 give/take 1 or 2. They all stop talking and start staring. One steps forward oozing managerial swagger and says “what can I get for you today” instead of a pleasant greeting. I say “were doing alright. Just grabbing one thing” and my friend and I go off to the basketball section. \n\nMy friend picks up a couple of balls so he can make his decision as to which he wants and accidentally drops it onto the floor. He picks it up and we walk away to browse some more. As we leave the section, I catch the guy who greeted us before watching us from a couple aisles away. Coincidence, perhaps that he was cleaning up or stocking that area. \n\nWe move on and go upstairs in the store to the outdoor wear section and start looking at hats and jackets. We decide to move to another section and we put the hats we were looking at back onto the rack neatly. Again as we leave I see the employee from before. He goes over to the rack and knocks it all over and takes a picture with his phone. I don’t say anything yet. \n\nWe end up in the fishing section when were approached by store security, two guys in standard security outfits. “We need you to clean up the mess you made at the hat rack and then leave the store” is what were told. “We didn’t knock anything over. We placed everything on the rack neatly. This gentleman right here,” I point to the employee who was following us, “Knocked the whole thing over and took the picture that he probably showed you”. \n\n“Look. We’re not here to discuss who did what. We just keep the store safe and prevent theft and keep out idiots like you kids. Since you’re making a scene, I’m going to search you.” Says security 1. My friend proceeds to tell the guy how to pleasure himself utilizing the baton on his belt as we head downstairs to the door, dropping the basketball in a bin, walking away from them. \n\nWe leave and head to Floormart. As we round a corner towards the rear corner of the store, the manager from Schticks is standing there with the manager of Floormart. Surprise surprise, we get asked to leave after being in the store for less than 10 minutes. \n\nWe got to both 6 Up and Dock 2 Exports and get the sane response. Each time the guy finds us and has the manager for that store kick us out. \n\nWe head back to where our families were, thinking that he was just going to stay at his little strip of stores. Turns out he followed us to the main part of the mall plaza. My friend turns around and says “If you don’t stop following us, I’m calling the police on you and pressing stalking charges.” \n\nHe turns and walks away, sent back to his strip. \n\nWe find out later, from Mall Security, that he would do that to a fair amount of people and that they were actually investigating\n",

        "text": "So a couple friends and I decided to head to a bar downtown that's known for having 40-50 board games you can play while eating your meal.\n\nWe get there, grab some board games from the front and are taken to our table on the upper floor of this restaurant by a nice waitress in her early 20s.\n\nWe spend about an hour and a half there, just catching up and playing some games. The beer was overpriced, the food was awful (like the vegetarian burger I got didn't even have a proper patty, more a deformed mush of unknown vegetables). Not really related to the story but come on, you would hope a restaurant can make a patty that doesn't fall apart.\n\nAnyways, it's time to pay and so far, the waitress has been normal - just classic North American slightly fake nice service, nothing special. So I'm the first one up, paying debit. I go through the instructions on the machine and to my surprise, there is no tipping screen. I finish paying and as I hand back the machine to the waitress, start saying \"I'm sorry there wasn't a tip option on the machine and I don't have cash, is there any way I can tip you otherwise\"\n\nShe probably looked at the receipt real quick, seeing no tip, and halfway through me explaining what happened, proceeded to turn around towards my friend and stick her left hand out until her palm was an inch away from my face. She didn't say a single word to me.\n\nI was taken aback and didn't know what to do and my friends all looked at me with a \"wtf???\" look. My friend explains to her how rude she is being and that the machine isn't giving a tip option and she just walks off. Comes back with a different machine and now the tip option is available. But it wouldn't have mattered anyways because none of my friends gave her a tip. She glared at each of them and we got out of there as soon as the last payment was made. \n\n",

The coffee shop is located in a large general store. I was waiting at the collections desk to pick something up I'd ordered online. In front of me was a foreign gentleman who clearly didn't speak a lot of English. He was holding a laptop in a box, brandishing a £20 note, and trying to hand the note over to the two half perplexed/half amused members of staff.\n\nThis is how the conversation went:\n\nFG (Foreign gentleman): Take, £20 please. Here, take. Pay. \n\nSM1 (Staff member 1): No Sir, the laptop is £299. Not £20. \n\nFG: No, £20. It say, £20! Here, take please. £20. \n\nSM2: Sir, the laptop is £299. We can't take £20 for it.\n\nFG:  No, it say £20! Here! On box! \n\nHe points to the box where it does indeed say £20...discount for Microsoft Office. \n\nSM1: No sir, that's £20 OFF Microsoft Office when you buy this laptop. The laptop is £299. \n\nFG (starting to look a little deflated): But, £20. It say. \n\nSM2: I'm sorry sir, it is not and we cannot sell you a laptop for £20. That's not what it says. \n\nFG: Not...£20? \n\nSM2: No sir. \n\nFG: Oh, okay. \n\nHe hands the laptop to them and walks away, staring down sadly at the £20 note in his hand. \n\nPoor guy. ",

We mention to the waiter that today was her father's birthday but we didn't request for anything special like cake or for someone to sing the birthday song. After we finished our main courses, he brought a dessert listed from the menu, lit a candle, and said happy birthday. I'm not complaining at all, this was a very nice gesture by the waiter but when we got the bill, we saw a charge for the dessert. There was a general look of shock on everyone's faces at the table because we've never been in such an awkward situation. A very nice waiter did something to acknowledge my girlfriend's father birthday but at the same time, charged us for it. \n\nNow, I don't know how it is at other restaurants, but usually that gesture is free. You get a dessert on your birthday if you politely mention it to the wait staff or at the very least, you get a greeting from the waiter/waitress. We brought this up to the waiter who said \"I thought this would be a nice way to celebrate your birthday.\" I think the situation bothered our family because this is basically a scenario where we're being charged for something we didn't order.

Perhaps 40 years ago it was, but nowadays it's a renovated double hallway of various stores that sell things like jewelry, cell phones, collectibles, upholstery, books and comics, clothing, furniture, musician paraphernalia, and a handful of dollar-type stores where nothing's a dollar.  There's also a bunch of food vendors including a hot pretzel place, a clam bar, a couple Mexican food vendors, a couple pizza places, an Amish bakery, a British importer, and a meat market/mini-grocery with deli.\n\nI hadn't been to this establishment since last March - but it's the last, the meat market with deli - that this story is about.\n\nPreviously, it used to be a walk-up counter with a huge selection of various pork, chicken, beef, and alternate meat options, plus a small deli counter.  Since it was remodeled, it's now a tiny mini-grocery, with an actual register lane, several aisles of canned and dry goods, a few freezers with a decent selection of meats and cheeses and pre-packaged foods.  \n\nYesterday I was \"in line\" at the deli counter getting some cheese sliced.  This is funny for the singular reason that I've had the worst luck with deli slicing lately.  But \"in line\" is presented \"in quotes\" because I was the only person, actually the only *customer*, within twenty feet of the deli.\n\nI'd ordered a pound of Colby Jack cheese, sliced thin, and the young man behind the counter looked at me funny.  I thought he'd not heard me, so I repeated my order, because I didn't actually see the cheese in the deli case.\n\nHe stated, \"no, no, I heard, it's just that, well, I'm not sure it'll slice thinly...\"  And he held up the round of cheese for my examination.  To be honest, it did look a little crumbly.  \n\n\"Do whatever you can,\" I requested.\n\nWhile he worked, I leaned up against a support pole right in front of the counter, trying to choose the rest of my order compared to what remained in the fridge at home.  I realized I didn't need anything other than that single pound of cheese.\n\nA man walked by me, ignoring both me and the deli counter entirely.\n\nThe deli rep weighed my cheese.  I apologized to him.  \"I'm sorry, I hadn't realized it would have that consistency, it's not what I'm used to.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he replied, \"it's a new brand for us too.\"\n\nAs he finished wrapping my order, that other customer who'd walked past me just a few moments ago came back up to the counter and inspected the number-dispensing unit.  He was an older man, dressed in Sunday nines, a golf cap, and a windbreaker.  He stabbed at it a few times while the deli guy handed me my cheese and gave me \"good day wishes\".\n\nI hovered nearby to examine their beef jerky offerings, in a tiered rack at the end of the deli.\n\nThe deli guy turned to the next customer and said, \"How can I help you sir?\"\n\n\"Th-ain't no number,\" he started.\n\n\"No sir, you don't need one.  How can I help you?\"\n\n\"You can help me by fixing this damn number machine,\" he replied, slamming his fist on it.\n\n\"Sir you don't need a number, I can take your order right now.\"\n\n\"I need to be in order with a number!\"  He was really starting to get agitated and slamming his fist on the top of the counter.\n\n\"Alright sir, I'll be around in a moment to help you by fixing the machine,\" the deli guy said.  He made a show of stripping off his gloves and made his way out from behind the counter.\n\nIt only took him four seconds to walk around the counter in full view of the other customer.\n\n\"You know what, fxxx it,\" the customer said.  \"I just want a number so I can wait in line.\"\n\n\"Sir, there was no line, I was done,\" I offered, and even moved away from the deli counter entirely.\n\n\"NO!\" he started to yell.  He slammed the ticket dispenser with his fist one more time, causing it to pop open and the roll of tickets to dislodge and almost fall out.  \"If you don't want to give me a number to wait in line, I don't want to wait in line!  Screw this shit, I'm going to the other deli here!\"\n\nHe bodily pushed past the confused deli guy and totally ignored me as he stomped out, drawing stares of the small handful of customers who'd entered during the exchange.\n\nThere is no other deli...",

I was already upset by this. \n\nI finally started to eat when my phone went off about an account of mine getting hacked, thankfully I was able to take care of the situation but needed to message a support member about it. The waitress came by to check on us as I was doing it and tutted at me, then grabbed my phone and tried to take it from my hand and said. “get off your phone and eat your food!” \n\nI was extremely pissed off, and already knew I was going to speak with the manager. I hate to be that person but I work in retail, I do a lot of customer service and I know that you don’t do things like that. \n\nShe came by with the bill and to ask about dessert but said to me, “I’m not asking you,” then asked my mom and brother, who declined, then turned to me and said, “now I’m asking you.”\n\nThe manager seemed pretty horrified so I’m hoping it got handled but I definitely would have been better off staying home. \n",

Murdered her firstborn? Had group sex with her husband? So when she finished her tirade and stalked away I asked what on earth had happened. They had charged her 10p for an additional butter packet that she had asked for with her toast. \n\nI don't have the words. ",

I enter with two of my friends. This one was slightly busy, but only had a few people.\n\nWe go to the fridge where the drinks are, which is about 3 meters long (about 10 feet), the same length as the shopkeeper's desk opposite.\n\nThe entire shop is about 5 meters wide, and 10 meters deep, so quite small, but bigger than the other shops.\n\nI can't decide which drink to buy, so I move to the side to choose quickly, as this shopkeeper gets triggered if you stay for more than 10 seconds.\n\nThe shopkeeper also only allows three people at once in the shop, for some bizzare reason.\n\nLet's make the shopkeeper SK, me as Me, and my friends as A and R.\n\nSK: (after 5 seconds of being in the shop) Come on, kids, hurry up! Move it!\n\nMe, A, R: (totally ignores him)\n\nSK: Hurry up! I'm going to kick you all out if you don't move it! Hurry up! (shouts) HURRY UP!\n\nHe's literally not serving his (single) customer, stopping to tell us to move it.\n\nI take my drink (a bottle of Coke, £1), A takes his, and R takes his. We walk up to the shopkeeper, to ring up our drinks.\n\nHe rings mine up first, and I give him a £2 coin, and gives me 50p change. \n\nI wait there, assuming he ran out of £1 coins and wait there for my remaining 50p. \n\nBut he moves on to A, leaving me there, 50p short. I point out, before he rings up A's drink, than he left me 50p short.\n\nThe shopkeeper literally goes apeshit, shouting how he gave me the correct change, and to get out. \n\nI stood there, saying that I want my remaining change. He eventually gives me my 50p change, shouting as I leave how I've been banned from the shop, and how he's going to report us three to the school, etc., etc.. \n\nA: I don't think I'll be needing this anymore..\n\nA storms out with me, money in hand and drink at the desk.\n\nR does the same thing, and walks out.\n\nPeople outside, waiting to go in, say to me, \"Don't worry, we know how it feels. Leave him be.\"\n\nIt just really annoys me about how he gets annoyed and makes me wonder how he even runs business.",

One list was from my mother in law, one from my husband. I did all my shopping, no problems, then we got to check out. I went to self check out since I was doing two seperate transactions and didn't want to confuse any cashiers, but I had trouble scanning some socks so I called over an associate for help.

        "text": "So I'm from the UK, and was in NYC for a week. I'd forgotten to pack my ear plugs, and since it's tough for me to sleep without them, I figured I'd use the errand as an excuse to check out the local area.\n\nI head into a nearby chain pharmacy, and after a brief unsuccessful search I ask employee #1 if they have any ear plugs. He told me he would 'go check' for me, and walked into the back. It was pretty clear from his dismissive tone and body language that he wasn't actually going to check anything, but whatever, maybe he's just tired. I just shrugged and asked someone else, employee #2, who walked me to the display immediately.\n\nSo I'm standing in front of the display trying to figure out which ones I want, taking my time since the brands are all unfamiliar. 5 minutes goes by, and employee #1 emerges from the back. It's a fairly small store so we make eye contact, and he approaches me.\n\n\"Sorry sir, we don't carry ear plugs\"\n\n\"They're right here mate\". I gesture to the display in front of us.\n\n\"Oh\". He's taken by surprise and a little embarrassed, and isn't sure how to respond.\n\n\"I'm sure you tried your best though, when you were in the back. Thanks for all the hard work\".\n\n\"Go fuck yourself\".\n\nNow it was my turn to be surprised. I was giving the guy a hard time, sure, but it wasn't malicious. I actually just thought the situation was funny and was simply pushing his buttons to mess with him. I could have been a lot more of an asshole considering he deliberately wasted my time.\n\nAfter this though, things got a little out of hand.\n\nEmployee #2 pokes his head around the corner. Turns out he is not just employee, but is also the manager on duty. He hadn't gone very far since showing me to the display, and had heard everything that just happened.\n\n\"What did you just say to that customer Daniel??\"\n\nCue an argument between them so loud and intense that it almost ended in a fistfight. Hooooly shit. I guess Daniel had a lot of pent up frustration. Finally he throws his scanner to the ground, spits at me, swipes a whole row of shampoo off the shelves and stamps out. The entire store has frozen with everyone looking at us, and I'm just standing there with a dumb look on my face not sure how to react.\n\nI got free ear plugs out of it though, so that was pretty cool.",

        "text": "I feel like this story might be polarizing but I figure I'll toss it out there and let ya'll be the judge.\n\nA few years ago I was living in the city and my roommate loved everything Korean, especially Korean BBQ. I'd never had it before so she decided to take me to her favorite spot. I like all kinds of food and love trying new things so I was down. We took a few trains and buses and get to the restaurant.\n\nWe get our drinks and all is well. My roommate suggests we order a meal where we'll cook our own meat and get a dozen+ sides. Sounds good, we order.\n\nThe cooking apparatus comes out followed by the food. There are probably 15-20 small bowls stacked on each other maybe 3 or 4 high so most of the food is being touched by the bottom of the bowl above it and all the bottom bowls are resting on the raw meat. I was immediately concerned which grew as the waitress (roommate later informed me she was the owner) put the bowls one by one on the table. Turned out half the bowls were for my roommate, the other half for me so there were 2 bowls of each item. The waitress mistakenly put 2 of the same item on my roommates side, grabbed the mistaken bowl, put it back on the meat, then placed that and some other bowls in front of me.\n*for clarity only the meat was to be cooked on a small open flame grill, not the sides which were things like slaw, kimchi varieties, veggies.\n\nI was appalled. I asked her if she noticed what she had done and it became clear there was a language issue. We spoke it out best we could and she ended up offering to bring us fresh meat but knowing what she did in front of me made me uneasy about their practices behind closed doors. So I said no thank you and did my best to clearly explain to her that I would not be eating or paying for the food that was brought to me. She took the food in front of me back to the kitchen, not a bite eaten.\n\nMeanwhile my roommate is happily eating what she received. Like I said, she loves the stuff.\n\nSo when she's done we get the bill and my food is on it. I talk to the waitress/owner about it and she's pissed - I'm thinking I wasn't as clear as I thought in our earlier conversation. She would not adjust the bill so eventually I just left without paying (roommate paid and tipped). Of course I never went back but I'm sure the roommate did haha.\n\nI did feel bad about the miscommunications or whatever had happened but I wasn't about to eat or pay for that experience.\n\n*I just noticed I forgot to mention in my story - my roommate told me that was the norm at these kind of restaurants which is why I thought this might be polarizing.",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster, standard apology for formatting and all that jazz. Never thought I’d have something to submit here- but I do now.\n\nToday on my lunch hour (11-12AM) I decided to stop by a store I will call Red-Letter-Mart because its name begins with a single letter, ends in –Mart, and uses the color red in their logo. Now, I almost never go to Red-Letter-Mart because the one in my town never has anything in stock, it’s run down, it *smells*, and the customer service is non-existent. But all I needed today was a new pillow, so I figured I’d be in and out in five minutes, tops. \n\nI go in, grab my new pillow (50% off FTW) and head to check out. It’s 11:15 AM, so there’s only one lane open. I get in line behind a mother who I’d guess is about 29, who is buying groceries and stuff with her 2-3 year old daughter in the front seat of the shopping cart. The cashier is this at least 70-year-old-woman who looks like her last ‘good’ day was some time during the Nixon administration. The daughter, as sweet as can be, nudges her mother on the side to get her attention, then points to a pack of M&amp;Ms on the rack opposite the register and says “Please, mommy?” The mother breaks out in a huge, happy smile and says something along the lines of “Of course, since you said please.” She takes the packet of candies and places them with the rest of the things she’s buying. The witch at the register decides now is the time to pipe up. “You shouldn’t feed your children that stuff. You’ll make them fat.” She says, her voice carrying about as much derision as I’ve ever heard someone speak to a stranger with. The mother glares at the cantankerous old crone and politely explains “This this the first time she’s ever said ‘please’ when asking for something. I want to teach her that being polite pays off.” The old bag at the register replies with “That’s just lazy parenting.” The mother gives the cashier a look and says “You’re being awfully rude.” The cashier just rolls her eyes and starts bagging the mother’s items. The mother looks at me, aghast, and asks “Am I wrong here?” \n\nNow; I know I shouldn’t get involved. I usually don’t. But this woman was looking right at me, so without thinking, I say “No, that was pretty uncalled for.” Now the old bat at the register’s attention shifts to me. She gives me a sour look that only old ladies can pull off and says “SOME people should learn to mind their own business.” This wrinkly sack of unsolicited opinions has the gall to chastise a stranger’s parenting, then tells ME to mind my own business?! Really? I simply said “You first.” In reply. \n\nThe old lady at the register gives me a toothless snarl and returns to her job, ringing up the mother’s items. Her register beeps, and this old bat’s face twists into the sourest, most vindictive expression I think I’ve ever seen. She GLARES at the mother and her daughter and, through pursed lips, mutters “Congratulations, you’ve won our daily cash give-away.” It took everything I had not to laugh as the sour old itch-with-a-b handed the now smiling mother a 15-dollar gift card. \n\nI checked out quickly, avoiding eye contact with the leathery old bat, and went up to the customer service desk and asked to speak to the manager on duty. I told the manager what happened, and he sighed and said this “wasn’t the first” complaint she’d received, and that it “would be handled”. I very much doubt anything will happen to the old crone, but who knows? \n",

So when I come across this cheese brand I simply looked at the date, and surprisingly the one I picked up had the date 9/3/2018, so I took it not paying any more attention to it. Later when I returned home I gave the groceries to my mom and she started setting up breakfast, just to find that the cheese I picked up had this greenish brown mold in the middle, she asked me to go replace it, to which I oblige. As soon as I got to the store I asked the cashier where I can go to get it replaced and she led me to the managers office, do note that I do infact have the receipt which was only 2 hours old at this point, and the product has that day's date on a sticker that contains the store's logo, and the store does actually offer refunds &amp; replacements. So I enter the manager's office with the cheese inside it's packet exposing the mold, I explain to him the situation, and he's in complete denial, he continued questioning me if I bought the cheese from their store, I showed him the proof: the receipt from 2 hours ago, the date on the cheese packet, their logo on the sticker, yet he said that I was attempting to scam their store by attempting to replace an item I bought from another. Yes I understand that many try to scam stores using a similar method and all, but I literally had all the proof they required to make a replacement, so after a while he leaves and gets me a new packet of the same brand and then follow up by showing me that it wasn't moldy and handed it to me. When I wish it ended there but it didn't, he told me he'll let it slide this time around, and banned me from the store, to which I replied \"I would never shop at a place with a manager as stubborn as yourself\", and proceeded to leave the store. I seriously don't understand what his problem was, and I probably never will, and it was all for a pack of cheese that was worth 2$ which all I asked for was a replacement.\n\nNote: I don't like nor understand how cheese works, and so I am not sure whether the packaging was falsely advertising an older product masking it as newer one or whether or not cheese molds quickly.\n\n**EDIT**  \nNote 2:  \n* The cheese had 2 dates printed following the European date format (dd/mm/yyyy) as I don't live in the US.  \n* The dates were P: 09/03/2018, and E: 15/03/2018.  \n* The cheese was bought from a small local store that didn't own a website nor an official way of contacting the owners, as everything was left up to the manager to decide.  \n* This store doesn't belong to any chain and so there isn't anyone I can contact about this.  \n* No, my mom doesn't know about me getting banned and I prefer that she doesn't cause any scenario as they could call the cops on her any they wouldn't be affected.  \n* No, I am not gonna sue them for this, as I simply can't (I am under 18) and I don't want to deal with lawyers during an examination session.\n",

        "text": "Hi TalesFromTheCustomer,\n\nI wasn't aware this sub existed until today, but man is it a trip.\n\nAnyway, this story is about 2 or 3 years old now.\n\nI had driven down from a certain homicide-problem-having-city in the Midatlantic region to visit my dad in a small town about an hour outside of a certain run down steel city in the South.\n\nSo this town has a single traffic light that's on flash most of the day, and there's one popular sandwich shop as its only national chain. To go to a big hardware store, you have to drive into the next county. We're talking *backwoods*, here. \n\nMy dad wanted to make orange pancakes (you use OJ instead of milk, a redneck invention when we ran out of UHT milk on a camping trip in the desert of a certain everything-wants-to-kill-you continent/country in the 90's). Little bit of family nostalgia, that's cool. The problem arises when we realize we're out of orange juice at the house.\n\nMy dad is retired, and lives a quiet life at home, and I'd just driven about 800 or so miles to come see him, so what's a few more to go pick up some orange juice?\n\nI know where the town grocery is, so I hop in the car and drive down the road through town, a whole two minutes to the other side of town. \n\nI walk in, and it's like time stopped. I'm wearing an Oxford cloth button down untucked with khakis; it's not like I walked in wearing a torn up Ramones shirt and ripped jeans with Doc Martens. I know, I'm in the South, I keep moving. Walk right over to where the juice is, because I'm familiar with the store after a few visits over the last several years.\n\nI pick up my orange juice, and a 12 pack of my dad's favorite soda whose name reminds one of fresh droplets of water on a grassy hill, and go wait in line.\n\nI get to the checkout, and the cashier, a mid-40's ish woman, is just staring at me. It's at this point I realize that it's because my collar is unbuttoned (I have tattoos on my upper chest) like a normal person would wear the shirt without a tie. She's also staring at my small number of earrings.\n\nShe tells me my total, which is like 3 something. I hand her a $5 bill.\n\nShe looks at the fiver. She looks at me. Back to the fiver. Back to me. Steels her expression, turns around towards the register...\n\n*and grabs the fucking counterfeit-marking pen, and stares me down while marking my FIVE DOLLAR BILL.* The pen marks the bill.\n\nApparently, having satisfied herself that I'm not a drifter hitting small towns for their orange juice and soda as part of an international racketeering scheme, she takes the money, gives me my change, and without a word spoken the entire time aside from my \"hi, how are you?\" turns to her next customer.\n\nNice bit of Southern hospitality, that.\n\ntl;dr: down-in-Dixie cashier is suspicious of my orange juice/soda purchase and counterfeit-marks my five dollar bill.\n\nEdit: that's a lot more reaction than I expected. Thanks everybody\n\nEdit 2: As some of you have surmised, anonymizing *everything* was done for humorous effect.",

        "text": "So this isn't my story, and sorry if the format sucks, FTP, LTL and am on mobile.  I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit, but I felt it may fit. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo a little bit of background. At the hospital I got to, they have different \"clinics\" for the different insurance companies (the major ones at least), so if you are covered by that insurance you don't have to wait in the ER. Now they keep the same triage nurses on rotation in these clinics, so if you go there often (I got many sport related injuries and went every couple of weeks or months) the nurses get to know you, and you know them, which is nice. \n\nSo I was about 18 when I had gone once, and one of the friendlier nurses remembered me and started chatting while taking my temperature and blood pressure etc. She asked who I came with and I mentioned I came by myself, and she was like \"Ah! You are so mature! I have 20 something year olds still being brought in by their mums!\" \n\nI looked at her like \"are you for real?! \", and she proceeded to tell me a story about how a couple of weeks back, a 22 year old girl was brought in by her mum, and the girl was attending one of the local universities. So the girl told her her symptoms, she got sent to the doctor, the doctor gave her meds, and they went on their way, normal protocol. A couple of days later the pair return, saying the symptoms have gotten worse, and the meds aren't helping. \n\nSo the doctor sees them again,and orders some tests which the nurse must do. The nurse suggests a pregnancy test before performing the other tests, as they were more invasive. The doctor agrees. \n\nKeep in mind I live in Kenya, where something like 84% of the population are devout Christians, and pre marital sex is hiiiighly looked down upon. \n\nSo the nurse tells the girl and her mother that she wants to perform a pregnancy test first, if it is negative, then she will proceed with the other tests. The mother goes on a rampage saying how daaaare she accuse her baaaby of having sex, and no she refuses to let her do the test,her insurance won't even cover it, now the nurse wants her to start spending more money, the nurse isn't even a doctor, who does she think she is, blah blah blah. \n\nThe nurse really feels that the symptoms are a side effect of a pregnancy,and is trying to save them money by not doing the invasive tests. The nurse calmly pulls 1000ksh ( $1 = ±100ksh) out of her purse, looks at the mum dead in the eye and tells her \"Here, go buy a pregnancy test. I am telling you now, I refuse to do anything else for your daughter until she takes this test.\" \n\nThe mother grabs the money, goes and gets the test, lo and behold! The test is positive! The nurse is then able to prescribe some other meds for the daughter, the mum quietly tries to hand money back to the nurse, who refuses to take it saying she doesn't need it, at least she was able to help her patient. The mother doesn't apologise or anything, grabs the daughters hand (who looks terrified might I add) and walks out of the hospital. \n\nTL,DR: Nurse suggests a pregnancy test for a 22 year old female brought in by her mother in a highly religious country. Mother gets offended, yells and insults nurse, who then proceeds to give her money for the pregnancy test,which turned out to be positive. ",

Didn't get the call so just came to pick up my car before they closed and saw that it was still in the same spot and they didn't look at it.  I did not make an appointment so it would've been completely fine if they told me at any point in the day that they were too busy but to not receive a call at all was disappointing.  Also a month prior about 6 hours after dropping off my car I get a call from the same shop that they looked at my car but it was too late in the day to fix it.  (I dropped my car off 2 hours after they opened and I scheduled this in advance)  They did fix the issue the following week, but it took 2 visits and it appears it will take 2 for them to fix this one as well.  At least I got a call the first time but ultimately in the span of 1 month I waited 2 full days for service only to not get any.  So I'm not thrilled or pissed.  Just befuddled.\nIs this normal when dealing with a car shop?  I know I can take my business elsewhere, but I have come here for years and have not had this happen.  Waiting all day for service is the norm for me (which I have no issue with), but not getting service 2x in 1 month seems unusual.  I clearly understand that car shops are busy, but would've been nice to at least get a phone call when they said they were going to.  I'm not a complainer so just want to get an opinion on this and ultimately not have to waste future days.",

When you turn 18, you can buy whatever you like.\n\nMy sister is 17 and has a driver’s license.\n\nS = Sister\nC = Cashier\n\nShe was having a wonderful Friday and was (is still) excited for tonight.\nShe and her friend had picked: A bottle of sour shots (16,4%), some cheap white wine (10,5%), x2 6-packs of beer (4,5%), and 8 small ciders (4,5%).\nThis following exchange happened when she went to pay.\n\nC: Can I see your ID, please?\n\nS proceeds to hand over her driver’s license.\n\nC: It says you’re only 17.\n\nS: Yes? I know how old I am.\n\nC: You can only buy alcohol over 16,5% when you’re over 18.\n\nS: I’m very aware, but what is the problem?\n\nC: Your alcohol is over 16,5%.\n\nS was very confused by this since you obviously go for alcohol under 16,5% when you're under 18.\n\nS: I believe you are mistaken. Nothing here is over 16,5%.\n\nC proceeds to add together the alcohol percentages right in front of S. \n\nYes, you read that right.

That’s not how it works at all.\n\nC: I’m sorry, but that’s the rules. You can't have any of the 6-packs. You can either have the shots, 3 ciders, or the wine and a cider.\n\nIf you have done just a little math in your head by now, you'd know that a 3-liter wine was fine, but more than 3 small ciders? You better be in jail.\nS didn't have much time on her hands and was very embarrassed by the situation since there were other people waiting in line. She chose not to pursue the matter further.\n\nS: I.. I guess I'll have the wine and a cider.\n\nC: Anything else?\n\nS was still baffled, but she paid for her items and exited the store.\n\n\nSometimes you just don’t have the patience to deal with stupid.\n\nTL:DR: Want to buy 3 liters of wine? Be my guest. Want to buy 3 small ciders? Go to jail!\n\nedit: typo",

        "text": "So my bank has one of those ATM things where you slide your card and go into a room to use the ATM. I used to work at a bank when I was in college and we just had the regular standard atm outside and people always complained how unsafe it was since we were in a sketch area so I can see the value in these atms \n\nAnyway in my years of using these atms , I AlWAYS wait outside the room when someone is using it. Always . I never once have tried to slide my card and go in there. For one from working at a bank , I’ve seen various emotions from people related to money from happiness to paranoia and stress .. something like that could make someone go bonkers .. for 2, what if someone is pulling out a couple grand in cash? Some people do that , use multiple cards at one atm to pull money out . I wouldn’t want you 2 ft from me so I won’t do that to you out of respect . Anyways I’m in the room yesterday putting my check in when suddenly the door bursts open behind me!!!!!!\n\nI turn around super confused . Since I’ve never slid my card when someone is in there , I assumed it looks or something once it knows someone is in there . To my surprise , a lady in sunglasses and a scarf around her head covering her face Bursts inside \n\nI stare at her confused and I say something like “ wait the door opened ? How did that happen ? “ she was like “yeah it did it let me in”\n\nSo I am a little upset because of her lack of privacy but she was also pretty covered up so I didn’t want to let the situation get weird. So I simply tell her “ honestly I always just wait until the person is done doing their business , I’m surprised it even opened “ \n\nShe was like  “ohhhh well hmmm it’s really cold outside I just couldn’t stand there “\n\nSo I finish my business and I debate telling her “look so I’m pretty chill that’s why I didn’t make a big scene but I worked in banking for 7 years . I’ve had people scream in my face for giving them 20s instead of 50s. I would be careful bursting inside a Private atm room until the person is done , I just wouldn’t want someone to go biserk on you because I’ve seen it all “\n\nBut I didn’t say anything , it’s my not responsibility to guide her but it was very odd and bizarre . Had she walked inside the branch they would have made her take her sunglasses off ... that is standard in any bank they need to be able to see full faces for the cameras 🎥 \n\nThis was just odd to me , maybe she thinks it’s ok to barge in while someone is in a private room doing atm business but I felt it was super rude . The bank should have a sign or something ? \n\nAgain I might sound like a cry baby but I worked in banking . I’ve seen people be irate over nothing so that could set someone off ",

        "text": "So first off, I am 27/yo and look a bit young,but i have worked as a car Salesman for a year. So i have been researching and reading about this car for a year now and i decide to buy it.The car is the Alfa Romeo Guilia Quadrifoglio and i already have the Bmw e60 m5 but i'm tired of it giving me problems and besides it's kind of old.\n\nAnyways,I do my research reading every fact I could.I also dress up nicely so i can get a good deal. I wanted to test drive it first. So as soon as i pulled up to the parking lot in my car, No one looks. Pretty busy day i guess. So I walk inside and saw the car in all it's glory staring at me.So I look at it from every angle and after 15 mins,still no salesman approaches me so i head over to the reception and ask her to send a salesman if they're free. So after another 15 mins a Old guy comes out and right away i can see he's pissed. Without even asking me who i am he begins with what i want.So i shrugged it off and told him i'm looking for the Guilia. He then proceeds to show me other cars which i get cause he want's that commission.Anyways after wasting 15 mins i ask him to test drive the car. He then proceeds to show me cheaper cars like the BMW 3 series. Finally i say \"Can i test drive this car or can you send me any other Salesman which can do it?\" Then he begins to ask for my licence and half heartedly leads me outside. We get in the car and I drive around for barely 3 minutes. Then he says he would drive me back.After that when we get back to the dealership and he sends another Salesman to assess me. This one wouldn't shut up. He would list all wrong figures about the car and wouldn't tell me the price. After that he begins to tell me that this is indeed a +90 horsepower v6. I tell him it's a 503hp car and what he's talking about! then this idiot begins to tell me that the 90 degree written on it is +90 horsepower more. So i politely tell him to send over another Salesman as i begin to explain him that i'm not an idiot and that the 90 degree v6 is the V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. here's how the conversation goes then.(Asshole is A and i'm Me)\n\nA-\"It doesn't matter cause you can't afford it anyways\"\nMe-\"What!\"\nA-\"Stop wasting my time,I know you Millennial's only test drive exotic cars and click a picture of it and show off!\"\n\nThat moment i call the manager(M for Manager)\n\nM-\"what seems to be the problem sir?\"\nMe-\"Your salesman over here tells me i can't afford the Guilia and begins to tell me that how I a Millennial will just click pictures of me driving it and not buying it.\" \nM-\"I'm sorry sir I'll call another Salesman\"\nMe-\"No need for that,As i have decided to buy it from a dealer a mile away from here where Saleman don't Abuse Customers and i had also come here to for a downpayment of 20,000$ but i guess the dealer over there would enjoy it.Thanks a lot\"\n\nThen the manager begins to plead me to stay but i just walk outside and now the asshole looks at my car in shock as I drive off\n\n",

The last time i had whip cream smashed in my face it caused me to break out all over my face and got in my contacts and caused me to not be able to see very well. I am currently in college and have to drive an hour back to school so I really would rather not have my vision impaired you know for safety reasons. My mom says she will just let them know not to do that and I even remind people not to let it happen when we get there. We all know what's coming next.\n\nAt first I see the workers coming up to sing which is fine until I see the worker with whip cream in his hand. I look him directly in the face and say please don't do that to me. Not really sure he heard me but then my mom, three sisters sitting around me, and my aunt all tell them not to do the whip cream. So they start singing and I notice that the whip cream starts to come towards my face and my reaction, as anyone who doesn't want something in their face, is to swipe the arm away from me. I turn around and instead of the man who had it at first it's a woman. I say \"I told yall not to do that\" and she says \"well you didn't have to throw it back at me but that's fine\" and throws the plate down and stomps off. Now I have worked in customer service and even if the customer does something wrong you don't say that to their face especially when you are in the wrong. \n\nI just don't understand when someone tells you repeatedly not to do something to them you try and you do it anyway, you then get pissy when they retaliate? Needless to say my family sat in shock for a minute afterwards and I was pretty aggravated for the rest of the meal, until I saw the video one of my sisters took and see my other sister's face next to me after it happened.\n[Birthday Mishap](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqit5xn37scdehc/birthdaymishap.3gp?dl=0)",

        "text": "My grandfather passed away last week. And due to the business he owned(he rented jukeboxes, video game cabinets and back in the day cigarette machines to bars), he had a lot of personal relationships with bar and restaurant owners, and one of those owners offered a buffet lunch and any drinks we wanted for after the service which was on a Friday. So when we got there the tables were still set up for dinner service and we wanted more family style, so we started to move some tables since a good chunk of us have worked in restaurants and bars, when one of the servers started yelling at us to not touch the tables and she would move them, ok whatever, probably some liability so we all grabbed some drinks at the bar while she did that. \n\nWhen we were all seated she took the rest of the drink orders, most took ages to get to anyone(like I waited 20 mins for a coffee but there were 20 of us, so I understand it can take some time). After we got our drinks the owner popped in apologies that he couldn't stay but had to run to his other bar, but gave a toast to my grandfather and said some stories about how he helped his dad out of many tight situations and was a good guy, then he left.\n\nNow the food, the options were pretty simple, salad, rolls, steamed salmon with hollandaise, chicken marsala, penne and mashed potatoes. I was like the 3rd person to get food, I skipped the salmon because I don't like cooked fish when the server was all \"What no salmon? It's lent. Everyone should be eating fish\" when I told her I'm not religious and don't eat cooked fish she huffed and plopped the chicken on my plate and some potatoes. While seated I heard her basically say the same to my other older cousins and brother(ages 22-26). At the table, my dad and I laughed it off at how I got fish shamed and he didn't, probably because I'm younger. Got a couple beers while waiting for dessert, which also took ages to come out...and it was ALL chocolate cake, so when she offered me some I said \"no thank you\", my mom was next, she also refused cake because she's always on a diet, and then the server looked and my mom and I and went \"Why the hell did I cut so much cake if no one is going to eat it\". Thankfully we're pretty good at laughing things off and now have a new inside joke in our family, but I am still in disbelief that she was so vocal to a family that was mourning the loss of someone.\n\nSo that was the time I was shamed for not eating fish after my grandfather's funeral.",

My Name Is” for the new puppy. The total for everything came out to $68.15 and I handed you a hundred dollar bill. The change back was $31.85\n\nWhen you opened your drawer, you noticed you had no tens and no fives, so you had to give me a twenty, and eleven single dollar bills. You apologized up and down, and at that point, another gentleman had stood behind us in line. \n\nI looked in my wallet and noticed I had a ten dollar bill in there so I came up with a solution to try to make it easier but I ended up making it way worse: I give you a ten dollar bill, making the change add up to 41.15 and you that way you can just hand me back two twenties and only one single dollar bill, and hey look at that! You’re technically no longer out of tens! \n\nI could see the look of confusion and panic spread over your face. We had to explain it a few times to you until it made sense, to the point where the gentleman behind us got involved and he assured you we weren’t trying to short your drawer. The whole time, you kept apologizing and smiling, explaining you were really bad at math. Eventually we worked it out and we went on our way, only after noticing we had made the line grow quite a bit after our shenanigans.\n\nSo to you, my sister-friend, who loves animals and keeps your cool when strangers make your life confusing, I say keep your head up, and thank you for being you! I am ***SO*** sorry we made that situation harder than it needed to be. Life is hard enough, but it’s especially nerve wracking when you’re working with money that doesn’t belong to you, and your job depends on keeping a money drawer balanced (bartender here).

You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar, right? \n\nI hope you have an amazing day, and that your manager puts more small change in that thing! \n\nSincerely, \n\nu/shmatelyn",

        "text": "So, I've just spent the past 10 minutes trying to get this xposted from Tales from your server and it hasn't worked so....here I am copying and pasting this. Either way, FTP, only just heard of this sub.\n\nAnyway, this took place at around 8pm at night, on a night where the laziness kicked in and I didn't want to cook anything. As I wandered into the establishment, I found a pair of customers, one had already ordered, and the other, whom I shall call Steve (he doesn't fit Kevin, I know him from a previous job where I served him)\n\nSteve was ordering a meal and was told by the server that they didn't have enough ready to go for him to have it, but if he was willing to wait 5 minutes he'd be more then happy to cook some up. This to me sounds reasonable. Can't have an endless supply after all.\n\nSteve: oh come on mate, this is stupid. Your [blank] and you don't have anything. Server: I'm sorry, all I can do is ask if you'd be willing to wait for us to cook some. Steve: nah mate, this is stupid.\n\nThis went on like this for, I swear, 5 minutes. it got to the point where the other customer was jumping in to try and help Steve (she was getting served) I was stood behind them just watching this thinking how stupid the pair were. Steve eventually makes an order that he can get near enough straight away, but then asks to see the server's manager.\n\nThe Server walked to the back, grabbed what I'm presuming is his manager and lets him start talking to him in the background...and by background I mean 'one corner of the near empty floor'. I'm not even paying attention at this point, starting my order and actually have a pleasant conversation with the server.\n\nMy order actually involves the items that he would have to cook....\n\nServer: If you can wait 5 minutes we can have some ready for you. Me: that's perfectly fine, mate. I'll just grab a seat and wait if that's alright with you? Server: sure thing.\n\nHe gave me a small smile at this point, and we actually kept chatting while he worked.\n\nUntil Steve came back in. I heard the tail end of his complaint.\n\nSteve: ....so he's just talking instead of serving customers. what kind of place are you running here?\n\nwhat?\n\nthe Manager looked between me and the server, and I could tell from how he looked at us that he felt Steve was just playing up the issue for the hell of it. Sadly where I live (country wise) it's more customary to take the easy way out, apologize and compensate them for it. He didn't get a free meal, but he got one of the items on his order for free. he got to choose.\n\nHe choose the cheapest thing there, then tried to complain that they didn't explain it well enough before I told him bluntly 'I understood it perfectly and I'm not even in the conversation.'\n\nHe stomped out with his order. I was sat there another few minutes having a drink and I see the manager and the server quickly talking to one another, enough so I couldn't hear. when my order was finally done, he offered me a drink on the house for my patience (this one is actually company policy apparently. I don't buy it but hey, not gonna complain) and when I got back I found out that they'd actually upgraded my order to, effectively, the next size up for EVERYTHING.\n\nI have a lot of respect for people in roles like this. It's a thankless job most of the time and often seen as a very low level, low skill market. It takes a lot to deal with the shit thrown at you and continue to serve with a smile, not to mention that, despite being on the tills, they're still human.",

        "text": "My best friend and I were doing a little shopping at a large discount store because that's what you apparently do for fun when you're boring and in your late twenties. I was buying a good number of things, a bunch of unexciting grown up stuff and a movie.\n\nWe got up to the cash registers and hopped in line as we were buying alcohol and they have to scan your ID. There was a middle aged lady in front of me with her daughter and she told the cashier that she wanted her items split into two purchases. The cashier missed this though, because while she wasn't speaking, she was watching a coworker who was busy talking to another customer. She did notice she had a line though, as she began ringing up the customer's items.\n\nOnce her coworker was done with their customer, she started talking to them about going on break. While doing this, she rang up the customers items as one purchase. The customer's daughter, a young girl of maybe 7, loudly asked her mother why the cashier hadn't separated the items. The cashier did not notice. The mother loudly and passively aggressively complained about it, but did not actually make an attempt to ask the cashier to fix it. And the cashier didn't notice.\n\nThis should have been our cue to maybe pick a different line. Instead my friend and I just sort of smirked at each other. Then it was my turn, and the cashier was still discussing something or other with her coworker. I didn't really care, I didn't need any special attention or anything so I figured no big deal. We managed to get her to pay attention long enough not to charge me for my friend's things, so that was good.\n\nThe total was higher than I expected, but I figured I'd bought quite a few things so it made sense. Not to mention I really hadn't been keeping track of a total while shopping.\n\nLater that evening I glanced at the receipt before I went to throw it out, and I was glad I did. I discovered why the total seemed a little high; I'd been charged twice for my movie, which was $25, being a new release.\n\nAt first I panicked, wondering how I would get my money back. I had no proof except I suppose security cameras that showed I only left the store with one movie. I finally decided I'd just take the receipt back to the store and explain what happened, and if worse came to worse I could try to contest part of the charge with my bank.\n\nSo I went back to the store, took my receipt to customer service and explained what happened. She looked suspicious and informed me she had to call a manager over. Okay, fair enough, so we wait for the manager, he comes over and she explains the situation to him. He too looked suspicious, but they processed the refund.\n\nMy friend and I ended up wandering the store again and I picked up another movie. As I was leaving the customer service desk girl caught my eye and glared at me until I was out the door like I'd gotten away with some master plan.\n\nI don't go to that store anymore. I get that shit happens, I work customer service, but come on man. You have a customer in front of you. That's who you pay attention to. Worry about the other shit later. I wonder how much money that lady has cost other customers, or the company.",

        "text": "FTP - been lurking on this sub all day and had to post my experience with a certain retail bank as a cathartic release. Sorry it's long, it's fueled by two-years of grudgingly driving past and wishful thoughts of what could have been. \n\n\nTo set the scene, this took place a couple years ago when I was living at home for a summer internship in a major city. We live in a pretty nice area along a main road which has your typical suburban amenities: pharmacy, grocery store, library, banks, etc. On this particular day, I figure I'll run to the bank quickly to make a deposit, and then continue on with my other chores. \n\n\nThere are two bank branches close to me. I usually head to the branch down by the affluent waterfront area since its nice and usually empty, but it takes about 15 minutes. There is a closer one that is in a slightly rundown area between my home and the waterfront. I've had a couple poor customer service experiences there before, but figure I'll shave off ~10 minutes. Boy, oh boy, I was wrong. \n\nI head into the bank and do the typical retail banking deal: wait in line, get to the counter, push my debit card and deposit form (thank god for mobile banking now) under the 1 inch plexiglass window and talk to the teller through the poorly orchestrated speaker system. Even if I wanted to, there's no way I could have reached anything on the teller's side of the wall. Since its a rundown area, there's also security guards at the ATM area who I passed on the way out. \n\n\nI head to the library and as I'm parking, see a call coming through. Don't answer since I don't recognize the number. I knew something was up when the voicemail notification came through. Turns out, its the bank teller who looked up my profile information, stating he's instigated a police investigation as I've stolen $2,300 from him. He's yelling to come back to the branch immediately so they can search me. \n\n\nAt this point, I wasn't jaded from living in the city and dealing with boneheads on a regular basis. I'm working for a certain 3-letter agency which required a background check, and am probably about the most honest and usually friendly person a customer service rep could hope to encounter on a given day. I call the number back and attempt to reason with him about how this must be a mistake. \n\n\nHe's irate, screaming about how I need to drive back immediately with every penny of the money, and how the police are on the way to arrest me. Looking back, none of this checks out, and I should have immediately escalated to a branch manager and asked them to review their video tapes. Lucky for this asshole, I was kind enough to drive the five or so minutes back, super stressed that I might be on the hook for something I clearly didn't do. \n\n\nKeep in mind this has all taken about 10 minutes at this point. I pull up and hop out of my car, noting that there is no police presence at the bank. I walk in and make a beeline for this teller. Somehow in the 5 minutes since our call, he's cooled off and looks calm as a cucumber. I'm freaking the f out, and start in on him, like \"Hey, there must be a mistake, I've come all the way back. Here's my receipt from my transaction, etc.\" \n\n\nThe asshole has the audacity to look me in the eye and shrugs, \"Oh, I found the money. My coworker moved it under a piece of paper while I was doing your deposit.\"\n\n\nTurns out, instead of using any rationale or logic, he just assumed I'd stolen the money and called me up with threats before even doing a prelim search. He didn't even bother to apologize for accusing me of robbing the place, threatening me, or for making me drive back. I was so shaken and upset I just retreated back to my car. I can only hope he's done something similarly idiotic again and lost his job/gotten a firm reprimand. Last time I visited the nicer branch, I commiserated with the branch manager about how shitty the tellers are at the other branch (not super professional of that guy either, but at least he's not accusing me of felonies!). \n\n\nTL;DR went to the bank to make a deposit, was accused of robbing the bank by a teller who hadn't even done a prelim search to see where he'd put it.

        "text": "I worked at a local grocery store for several  years, cross-trained in a few departments, but the last few years I was a cashier. It’s a small regional chain store,in a very small town,  and it is a horrible place to work. Drama between co-workers, backstabbing by management, a general dead-end job in an toxic work environment. I’ve been out of there for almost a year and the anxiety that place caused me has all but vanished. I now have 2 jobs, in distribution, drama-free, and life has gotten so much better! But the other day, on my way home from work, I decided to do a quick grocery shopping.  And a former coworker was my cashier.  \n\nFor the sake of this story, I’ll call her Dipshit.  Dipshit has been working there for about 2 years now. Dipshit’s favorite thing to do is call out sick, usually within 15 minutes of her scheduled shift, sometimes as much as a half hour *after* she was due in. Sometimes she just doesn’t call at all.  She’s been talked to, written up, suspended, hours cut, every little retail discipline you can imagine, but somehow she’s still there. I know for a fact that Dipshit’s “sickness” is that she drinks a lot at night, and ends up hungover. I know this, because she often talked about how much she drank, many times she’d come in in the morning still reeking of booze.  After I quit drinking (16 months sober now!) I could barely stand to work with her and spoke to her as little as possible. While early in sobriety, the last thing I wanted to deal with was tales of getting trashed and being hungover. But I digress, back to the story.\n\nSo on this day, as Dipshit is ringing up my groceries, slow as shit, she decides she needs to tell me all about her struggles. She scans an item with one hand, puts it in her other hand, then starts talking, no longer scanning or bagging, one of those people who cannot do two things at once. Her one-sided conversation goes a little like this (imagine a sllooooow drawl, and every sentence ends sounding like a question…):  \n\nDS: “So…I tried to call in this morning…? (scans one item) And  Sue*  said there was no one to cover my shift….? (places the item in the bagging area) So…I don’t knooow…I mean, when my alarm went off….at 10 this morning?(picks up the next item) I just felt…like…I don’t knoooowww? Like I was in…pain? (scans item) But I mean…I don’t think she tried…? To find anyone to come in…? I mean, if I called Mary…? Do you think she would come in for me…?  Because..well, did you hear…? That Billy in produce told Sally that he heard that Sue was quitting…? I mean…”\n\nOn and on she droned, not making a dent in the $60ish worth of food on the belt. I’m currently nursing a shoulder injury and by this time it was throbbing and I just wanted to get home and slap a bag of frozen tater tots on it and pop some ibruprofen.  In my head, I’m screaming “Shut up! Please Shut up!” Now, I’m generally a very nice person, nonconfrontational, but it kinda just came out…I said  \n\n“I’m sorry, Dipshit, but I really don’t care. I don’t work here anymore, I am just a customer who would like to pay and get the hell out of here. I hated the drama when I worked here, I got out, and I *really* don’t want to hear about it.”  \n\nI don’t know if she thought I was kidding or is just such a dipshit that it didn’t register, but she kept on, complaining about how they hate when she calls out, but other people call out and they don’t care, just slow-babbling with her “poor-me” bullshit, not picking up the pace. I started one-handedly bagging what she had scanned and I just snapped, “Dipshit, I DO NOT care. Really!  I don't work here anymore, I'm not getting paid to be here right now, I dont want to hear about it. I just wanna buy my groceries and go home! Can you PLEASE just ring me up without the drama? THANK YOU!”  \n\nShe just kind of jaw-dropped for a second, but finally shut up and got going on my order. I apologised as I was paying, \"Dipshit, I'm sorry for snapping at you, my arm hurts, I'm cranky, and dude, you know how much I hate this place, haha.\" She laughed agreeably, we said the whole \"thank you, have a good one,\" and off I went.\n\nAs I'm wheeling my cart toward the exit door, Sue called me over to the service desk, wanted to know what Dipshit was complaining about now. Apparently she’s in the habit of whining to all her customers about how unfair life is, people have been complaining about it. Sue then starts, “Oh you know that customer, Bob? Well the other day, Dipshit was telling him about Billy in produce who told Sally about…” and I just turned my cart around and said “Good luck with all that; I don’t work here anymore, so it’s none of my business. Have a good one!” and I just walked away.  \n\n\n(*just random names referring to the head csm, another cashier, and other employees)",

I don’t even know how to rename it but let’s just say it’s not too high end but mid range. I went there today with my mom in law and husband-our daughter was having a good time with my parents.\n\nAnyway we were in the checkout line, had to get a couple things that were on sale, and the cashier needed change, we all tell her no problem, my husband and I both are ex retail employees. My former floor supervisor was there to pick up the change order so of course she said hi asked how I was doing before heading back to get change. This enraged old lady behind us.\n\nOld lady-speaking to young mom behind her “Haven’t they got a clue? Making US wait around while they causally talk? They should have a safe by the cash register so WE don’t have to wait for them to get change. This is ridiculous”. Luckily the cashier beside us was done with her return (floor supervisor has to approve returns) and the old lady literally sprinted the 5 feet to the other cashier. \n\nMy husband apologized to young mom about taking so long, and she just replied I’m in no hurry just getting a couple things for my kids. That was nice, she didn’t even reply to the old woman’s rant.\n\nI worked there, the money is kept somewhere us cashiers couldn’t get to, it’s locked in a safe AWAY from customers and all in total it took less than 5 minutes. I didn’t know the cashier but we told her to ignore old lady and she was doing fine. I’ve been there so many times when I was doing cashier duties. I once had to wait around 10 minutes someone tried to pay for $5 in things with a $100 bill and I was low on cash because we were swamped that morning. I’m just annoyed at the attitude of some people. ",

        "text": "This actually happened a few years ago, but I just found this sub, so away we go!\n\nI was flying on vacation with a layover. Our flight for the last leg of the journey was delayed due to nasty weather coming out of that particular airport. It was delayed about 45 minutes.\n\nNo big deal, it happens. Not like you can control the weather, right? \n\nNot this bloke. He took it as a personal affront. He was harassing the gate agents about how he had a connecting flight  to make, and he *could not be late*. The gate agent was trying to use every single second of customer service training she’d ever had to placate the guy, but he was not having it. \n\n“I have a connecting flight to catch! I have a very important meeting, I am a regional manager!” \n\n“I understand that sir, and we are making every effort to ensure that the aircraft arrives here as quickly and as safely as possible. As soon as I have an update, I will communicate it to you. Unfortunately, we had some inclement weather that was beyond our control.” \n\n“I had better not miss my flight, or I will be calling the airline!” And with that, he stormed off.\n\nI shot her a look of sympathy, and went back to playing solitaire on my phone. About an hour later, the plane arrived. The gate agent personally called the guy to the desk to let him know that the plane had landed, and we would begin boarding in about 20-ish minutes. \n\n“Why can’t we start boarding sooner?” Damn dude, have you not flown before?\n\n“Sir, after the other passengers have deplaned, we must then clean the aircraft. We want to give you the best flying experience we can, and I assure we are working as swiftly as possible to get you to your destination.” You could tell this poor woman was reminding herself that slapping people was considered assault and that she was averse to prison.\n\n“I had damned well better not be late!”\n\n“We are doing our utmost to ensure that that won’t happen, sir.” \n\nI’m sitting behind him, and I flipped him off. She actually caught it and smiled at me.\n\nAs luck would have it, we sat across the aisle from one another, where he continued his campaign of abuse at the flight attendants. At this point, I’ve had it. I’ve been up since Helios, and there’s no reason for this bullshit. I also really just abhor people who hurl abuse at people who can’t do anything but take it.\n\nThe flight attendants are giving [Mr. Regional Manager]( https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/dysfunctional-family-dinner/n11072) the same spiel as the gate agent, and he’s doing everything he can to make their lives miserable over something literally nobody can control.\n\n“It’s almost like they can’t control the fucking weather.

I don’t think he expected that but he shut up.\n\nThe flight attendant gave me a free bloody Mary, a wink, and made sure to serve Mr. Important his watered-down Sprite last.\n\nOh, and just because I can be a petty little thing, I made sure to deplane before him and move with all the speed of molasses in a blizzard and take up the entire corridor.

        "text": "Telling this story on behalf of my dad, this happened last week. I went to my parent's house for the weekend and accidentally left my hearing aid there when I came home. Yes I know I'm a moron, it happens. So I realize on the drive and call my dad asking him to mail it to me the next day. He says he will and takes it to work with him to ship from there. \n\nSide note, my dad's business has a glass front and that's where the secretary sits so she sees the whole parking lot and street from her desk. Apparently their old (FedEx or UPS I don't remember) driver has retired and they've been covered by a new, to them and the business, person. The secretary has already had to call several times because apparently if the driver has no packages to drop off she won't come in and collect either. The secretary sees her drive past and not stop. So obviously my dad is trying to take all precautions possible. Due to her instability and what's being shipped, he wants insurance on the package. \n\nI guess when you ship something and want insurance on it, the instructions are as follows: you have 2 copies of a paper, the driver signs both, the driver takes the package and 1 copy of the signed paper, the driver leaves the other signed paper with the customer. Now you both have a copy verifying that there is insurance on this. Seems easy enough for me to understand but...not so for the driver.  \nShe comes in to drop things off and picks up the package. She starts to leave and the secretary tells her to wait and to sign the papers. She has no idea what the insurance papers are or what to do with them. Secretary explains how the process works and the driver is apparently still confused. Secretary explains again and tells her to sign both and take 1 with the package. Secretary gets distracted with a phone call and the driver signs 1 copy and takes it and the package with her, leaving the unsigned copy at the desk.  \n\nSecretary realizes what happened after the driver leaves and calls my dad up. My dad takes the paper and tracking number and calls (FedEx or UPS) because not only is the driver dumb, but now there's no proof of the insurance on the package. He is on the phone for OVER AN HOUR with a guy who clearly isn't listening to the issue at all and keeps giving him advice that isn't relevant. For example, he keeps telling him he should have printed the papers before it was picked up, and that there should have been 2 copies, and just a lot of other nonsense that proves he wasn't listening to my dad and didn't understand what the problem was.  \n\nI love my dad, he's an amazing man but I also know that when he finally snaps it has been earned and...you will know the moment. So after an hour of this guy condescending to my dad about it being his fault, my dad finally gets the guy to understand that he did print both, he did get insurance, he did put both copies out, he did explain to the girl what to do, etc. She didn't do her job correctly! The guy finally gets it, but then starts rug-sweeping about how \"[he's] sure it'll get there fine\" and that the driver might have messed up but my dad shouldn't worry since \"this isn't a big deal, hardly anything bad ever happens anyway\".  \n\nWith my dad, that is the moment. He yells at the guy, \"That is my fucking kid's hearing aid, do you understand that?! I'm not shipping a goddamn stuffed animal, I'm shipping a medical device that costs thousands of dollars! I followed your instructions, I did my part right. Your driver has no idea what she's doing and you're trying to convince me it's not a big deal that my kid might not get their goddamn hearing aid! If anything happens to that fucking thing, you can bet you'll buy a new one! Don't you fucking dare tell me it's not a big deal again!\" \nThe man sort of stammered out an apology and said he'd call the driver right away to mark the package and take the insurance precautions. 3 days later I had my hearing aid and all was well. My dad knows he shouldn't have yelled at customer service guy but it was the one thing that finally got something accomplished. Not to mention I don't think I'd ever tell someone the issue they were calling about wasn't a big deal, but maybe that's just me. No matter how old I get, my dad will still go to bat for me.\n\nTL;DR Delivery driver is bad at job, customer service is even worse",

        "text": "I hope this goes here, since it's about a nightclub and not a typical box store experience. \n\nWhen I was 18, I went to a local nightclub and danced like an idiot for hours with my then-boyfriend. I know I looked kind of young, maybe 16-17, but I had my ID and the bouncer let me in after checking it because it's legit. All was well, at least so I thought.\n\nIt was great, we had an awesome time, and I was sober the whole night because I was straight edge and didn't like breaking the law. We went back to the car and I patted down my pockets, realizing my ID must have fallen out  while we were dancing. (I didn't want to carry a purse the whole night, so I just shoved my ID and debit card into my pockets and called it an evening. A bad habit, in retrospect.)\n\nWe went back in and asked the bouncer if they'd found it, but were told to wait in the entry area. We complied, since we weren't doing anything wrong.\n\nHere's where it gets crazy because a big, bulky looking man (found out later it was the owner) comes CHARGING out in a RAGE. He was so angry that my anxious little 18-year-old self instantly thought \"fuck, what did I do wrong?\" He was so mad it was like an angry parent yelling at me, seriously. Looking back, it was so unprofessional, and he had me feeling small and nervous as hell.\n\nHe's AO (Angry Owner), my then-boyfriend is BF, and I'm Me.\n\n&gt; AO: How old are you?!\n\n&gt; Me: (truthfully) 18\n\n&gt; AO: Horseshit. Don't lie to me, little girl. How old are you?!\n\n&gt; Me: (terrified because I can't stand people yelling at me): 18. You have my ID right th--\n\nNow, all of the employees are pausing their cleanup, staring at this insane exchange and their angry boss, thinking they're about to watch shit go down and the cops get called. My BF is as shocked as me, because this all came out of left field, and I guess at this point he's quiet because even he's still processing this special brand of crazy.\n\n&gt; AO: You're lying right to my face, and it's pissing me off. Be honest with me and I'll go easy on you, but if you lie to me one more damn time, I'll-\n\n&gt; BF: Look at the ID.\n\n&gt; AO: I'm talking to her, kid, not you.\n\n&gt; BF: Look at the damn ID! She was born in [year]. It's currently [year]. That makes her 18.\n\nThe manager looks at the ID, does some mental math, hands me the ID without looking me in the eye, and retreats into the back room. I stare after him, completely shaken up from being verbally accosted, and my boyfriend is just beside himself at this moron. It totally ruined my night, and I was shaking on the way home.\n\nUgh. What an asshole.\n\ntl;dr a dumbass nightclub owner verbally assaults me because I look young and he's unable to do basic math.",

I was at the point of bursting out crying, I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. He wanted me to come with him so he could call the police. My grandma was standing next to me but she was old and didn't understand things the way they were, so she didn't say anything. \n\nME: \"I didn't do anything. I didn't. I was helping my grandma\" \nAfter a few minutes of saying it wasn't me who did it, this man left to watch the security camera and I walked away to try and find my mom. I started crying and told her everything. She was mad as hell. Few seconds later the same man walks up to me and my mom and starts apologising to me. He said that it wasn't me on the security tapes and he was very sorry etc. My mom lost it and starts saying things like \"how dare you accusing my daughter\" and \"watch those tapes before you do anything\". \n\nTo cut short I left with free bags of candy and my mom almost had this man fired. After all these years I can still remember how confused/scared I was but my mom screaming at this man making him regret his life made it quite alright. \n\nEdit: the store was really crowded and I was not the only kid there. I just entered the store and wasn't even close to the candy aisle. \n\nEdit: grammar mistake",

        "text": "Sigh, where to start with this one...\n\nSoooo sometime last year (not around Christmas time, mind you) I was just in a huge depressive slump. I worked a lame job and I lived far away from my friends in a really shitty place (the kind of situation that I should post in bad roommates if anyone checks out that sub). So basically on my time off, I spent most of my time in my room away from my roommate. To keep from getting bored, I would marathon tv shows. Like The Simpsons.\n\nI had pretty much all of the good The Simpsons seasons on DVD (1-10 and season 12) but I was missing season 11. After enjoying watching the first 8 seasons, I decided that I should try to find season 11 to add to the collection. Well, I did find it on the website for The Blue Store with the Yellow Price tag (again, don't know if you guys frown on using establishments by their name so going with that).\n\nI added it to my checklist to buy but then I realized that one of my discs for season 9 was somehow scratched. One of my favorite episodes was skipping like crazy. I tried washing it and trying to fix it but the damn disc still skipped. Sigh. So I thought maybe the website has season 9 available too. I looked it up and since it came out a loooong time ago, they had to backorder it and they wouldn't be able to get it sent to me for at least a month. Okay no biggie. I just wanted it to complete the collection I had. So I checkout my orders and leave it be.\n\nThe next day I'm on my email and see that I not only got a tracking number for season 11 but also one for season 9. I thought that was odd since they said they wouldn't have it for at least a month. Guess they found a copy in stock after all? So the few days pass and finally I get my packages. I open up the first one and find a perfectly wrapped season 11. I open up the second one to find.... Kathy Ireland Christmas movies. Two of them, wrapped up cheaply together..... What the fuck???\n\nSo at this point, I'm wondering what the fuck I do. I've never really returned any product before online. I see a note inside that says 'take it to your nearby store if you need to exchange or refund it!' Great, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo I go to my nearby store and get to the customer service desk. There's this girl there who seems kind of overwhelmed with the amount of guests she has. When it's my turn I explain what happened and tell her I need this refunded. The girl seems confused at first and then says that they can't do that there and you need to send it back and get in contact with them yourself. I told her the package said to just exchange it here and she said 'no we don't do that here.'\n\nI was pretty suspicious of this. My package didn't come with a return sticker like some other companies do for easy return. They expect me to pay to return the freaking movies I didn't want? And on top of that it said in the note in the package just take it to your nearby store to exchange it. I didn't want to negate the girl and call out that she didn't know what she was doing but I also didn't want to waste my time doing something I didn't have to.\n\nI walked away from the desk, got on my smartphone and found the number to call about returning products you bought online. A voice recording gave the only option- take it in to your nearby store to exchange it. Fuck.\n\nSo I went back over to the desk where the girl was with another woman and said 'look my package said to exchange it here and so did the website so there must be some way you can refund this for me.' The other woman said without hesitation that of course they can and took the DVDs for me and started the process. The other girl walked away. Smh.\n\nSo I asked the woman if they could still get me the season 9 Simpsons DVD. She said that they couldn't do that, all they could do was refund my card and if I wanted to try again, I could order the DVD online again.... Yeah no. Hard pass. Don't want to end up getting THREE Kathy Ireland Christmas movies next time. ",

        "text": "I have some very strange food sensitivities to some fruits and vegetables (and all nuts except peanuts) that can make it hard to eat healthy. For instance, raw bananas and apples cause my lips and throat to swell up - but I can eat them cooked or baked just fine. Carrots are also one of those foods. My sensitivities aren’t so severe that I need to request the kitchen watch for cross contamination (I can eat something that has touched a raw apple, for instance) but if something I’m sensitive to is in a dish I’d like to eat, I ask the server if I can have the dish without it (I don’t say I’m allergic because that’s not entirely true and I don’t need all the fuss over cross contamination that usually goes with an allergy). I’ve never had a problem til last night. \n\nWent to my favorite sushi place with a friend. It’s causal but a sit-down style restaurant with servers. I’ve been there dozens of times, no big deal. They have a great deal where you can get half a house salad, a cup of miso soup, and a sushi roll for very cheap, so that’s usually what I order. The house salad has thin slices of carrots in it, so it’s difficult to eat around them. I always request the salad with no carrots and again, I’ve never had an issue.\n\nWhen we went yesterday, we had a server we’ve never seen before, so I’m assuming she’s new. She was pleasant at first, took our drink orders, everything was fine. The problem started when it came time to order our food. I’ll be M, waitress will be W, friend will be F.\n\nW: What can I get you ladies tonight?\n\nF: I’ll have the blah blah roll, please.\n\nM: I’d like the salad and soup special with a blah blah roll, please, and could I get the salad with no carrots?\n\nHere is where W’s tone clearly changes.\n\nW: We can’t do that.\n\nM: Are you sure? I’ve been here countless times and it’s never been a problem.\n\nW: Yeah, I’m positive. We can’t take the carrots out.\n\nM: Okay...well I can’t eat carrots...\n\nW: So you’re allergic then?\n\nM: Well, not exactly, but I can’t—\n\nW: Because you can’t be allergic to carrots. I’ve never heard of that.\n\nM: I don’t really know what to tell you. If I eat them my lips swell up and it’s hard to breathe. I really can’t eat them.\n\nW: *sighs* Well fine, if you want me to pull out every carrot shred by hand...but I can’t guarantee I won’t miss any.\n\nF: You can’t just...make the salad...without the carrots? You have to put the carrots in, and then take them out?\n\nW: ...\n\nF: We’ll both take just the blah blah rolls please. To go.\n\nAnd that’s the story of how I learned that my carrot sensitivity is BS!",
