I've read in other articles that seasoning your roasts with things other than salt could leave your roasts tasting kind of funky because other ingredients (particularly those with a lot of aroma - like garlic) don't necessarily keep well.  Do you find this to be true, or does it matter if they are dry ingredients vs. wet ingredients to season overnight?",

Initially, I found it quite entertaining and insightful until I started noticing a common occurrence in the episodes that annoys me and takes away from the guest on the show.\n\nI think Ed is a great interviewer but in almost every episode he refers to/talks about seriouseats and how he made it with this website in the cooking world given the risky venture it was when he started out. I enjoy listening to the podcast to get a taste of the interviewees' special sauce and how they found their place in the culinary world. But in almost every episode he will either mention Kenji, Stella or seriouseats' success - I feel like it's a little rude to do that when you are interviewing someone (interview should be about them imo). Of course conversations can digress and topic of seriouseats comes up naturally but mostly Ed brings it up in an I, almost rude way.\n\nI just wanted to express my thoughts and see if you guys feel the same or I'm being overly critical. I love listening to peoples' stories and their achievements, its a great podcast! ",

        "text": "I just made /u/TheBraveTart [chocolate skillet cake](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/05/chocolate-skillet-cake-with-milk-chocolate-ganache-frosting.html) using Stella's recommended ingredients, Cacao Barry Extra Brute and Chocolove 70%. While the texture and moistness were great, I was really disappointed in the chocolate taste. With my eyes closed I'm not sure I could recognize chocolate. It tasted more roasty, pretzely. \n\nTo see what might be going on, I made a quick [mug cake](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/chocolate-cake-in-a-mug/?printable_recipe=84317) with the Cacao Barry and compared with my favorite natural cocoa (Trader Joe's, the one from Tumaco beans). I also thought the chocolate taste was almost nonexistent with the dutch.\n\nSo my question is... does dutched cocoa taste a lot less chocolatey than natural? Or is it that I don't like the Cacao Barry? Is there a brand of dutch that tastes more like natural? Or could I have gotten a defective/fraudulent bag (unfortunately very common on Amazon)?\n\nthanks for any insight!\n\nETA: I know Stella says I couldn't make the cake with natural cocoa, but I'm confused about why. It is leavened with baking soda, and usually soda is paired with natural cocoa and it says (even on [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/08/difference-dutch-process-natural-cocoa-powder-substitute.html)) not to pair soda and dutch cocoa!?",

        "title": "Questioning some of the \"science\" in Serious Eats articles about pectin. I'm taking you down, Serious Eats!",
        "author": "JuneberryAddict",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/8mixl3/questioning_some_of_the_science_in_serious_eats/",
        "text": "Hi chefs!  I'm trying to develop a jam recipe and I'm looking for some technical clarifications of some of the science discussed in several Serious Eats articles on making jams/jellies and food preservation. Hopefully that header can draw some attention, lol! You've been click\\-baited by the master. ~~You've been \"master baited\", one could also say~~. Pie in your face!\n\nAnyway, u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt, in \"[The Food Lab's Apple Pie, Part 2: Perfect Apple Pie Filling](https://sweets.seriouseats.com/2011/10/the-food-labs-apple-pie-part-2-how-to-make-perfect-apple-pie-filling.html)\", what's the name of this special enzyme apples supposedly have that makes pectin more heat tolerant? That article refers to America's Test Kitchen, who originally made this proposal, but I can't find any info about it anywhere online. Maybe because I can't figure out its name, as the article inconspicuously failed to mention it, which is odd considering how technically detailed Serious Eats and ATK generally are otherwise. You would think that if an enzyme like this exist, it would be more commonly used in an isolated form, like with invertase or pectinase, especially commercially. Does it affect how easily pectin can set as well? And what's the new max temperature that this heat\\-tolerant version of pectin can withstand before breaking down? Can one add some apples to jams of other fruits to have the same effect to its pectin?\n\nAs detailed in [\"From Jam to Jerky: Water Activity and the Science of Preservation\"](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/07/the-science-of-preserving-water-activity-strawberry-fruit-jam-pectin-sugar-how-to.html), and several other Serious Eats articles, if  the way that added sugar, at a high enough percentage, helps prevent spoilage and set pectin is by drawing water away from the pectin and microorganisms, than isn't this directly related to the increase in osmolarity by the sugar \\(or is it osmolality? Can never understand the difference\\). Isn't that why dextrose can be considered a \"hyper\\-absorbative sugar\"? It has twice the number of molecules per equal weight versus sucrose. In which case inverted sugar, for the same reason, should be able to be as effective as sucrose at half the amount, allowing a lower sugar content. Is this right?\n\nI'm considering this for developing a jam recipe that keeps the sugar content as low as possible, by sous vide...ing\\(?\\) the jam \\(in this case a high pectin berry called Juneberry\\) with added invertase, which requires, at 0.15&amp;#37; of a solution's weight, 60¬∞C, 4.5 PH, for 8 hours for complete conversion of any natural sucrose to dextrose and fructose, and hopefully negate the need for added sugar. I would then raise the temp to 70¬∞C \\(not sure for how  long\\), to inactivate the invertase and further develop the pectin set.\n\nAlso, I can't get a clear answer on what temperature breaks down pectin. One [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/pectin) claims \"Holding pectin solutions above 71 ¬∞C \\(160 ¬∞F\\)  in excess of 1 h is not recommended. Pectin in solution, when exposed to high temperatures for prolonged periods, breaks down \\(hydrolyzes\\)\". Yet a sous vide soft apple balls [recipe](http://www.molecularrecipes.com/sous-vide-class/sous-vide-special-applications/) calls for cooking at 75¬∞C for 3 hours. That Serious Eats [article](https://sweets.seriouseats.com/2011/10/the-food-labs-apple-pie-part-2-how-to-make-perfect-apple-pie-filling.html)  on making the perfect apple pie filling claims 84¬∞C to be the temperature at which pectin breaks down. Yet, most jam recipes call for the jam to be brought up to boiling point for longer than 1 hour to reduce water content, which takes much longer often.\n\nAny clarifications or advice would be appreciated, thanks!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nU**PDATE**: Thank's to u/THSOnline and u/supersuperduper for naming the mystery enzyme, ***pectin methylesterase***, [providing ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/8mk3mk/im_looking_for_some_technical_clarifications_of/dzoarb4)more info on how it works, and for confirming that inverted sugar would indeed be more effective at binding moisture, and therefore more effective at gelling pectin and preservation than sucrose.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I'll be testing out my idea of sous vide\\-ing the berries with and without invertase in a few weeks when they're ready for harvest, and post the details of the process and results. The plan initially is to sous vide the jam, checking the jam every 12 hours, and continue past the point that it gels, to the point that the pectin breaks down and the jam re\\-liquifies. This should give me idea of the window of time I'll have  to work with, at whatever various temperatures I'll try. This should also reveal around what point the pectin is most firm.\n\nI've also cross\\-posted this at r/AskCulinary. I go further into detail in the comments [there ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/8mk3mk/im_looking_for_some_technical_clarifications_of/dzogioq)on my goals for \"reinventing the wheel\", instead of just using low\\-sugar pectin. I think I've found some compelling reasons to try this method, and it could also apply to making jams for other fruits as well, if retaining maximum nutritional value and flavor, adding less or no sugar, and/or needing to prepare large quantities of jam is something you're interested in.\n\nAnd sorry for the click\\-baity title, lol! I hope it was somewhat amusing. I got a kick out of it, but now I know to keep my master baiting to myself, its no way to get people interested in you, my bad. Serious Eats has been my go to for years for learning how to be better in a kitchen, and I'm nothing but grateful.\n\n[Last year's Juneberries](https://i.redd.it/5x9ck86grh011.jpg)",
