That, according to 19th century nationalists such as von Treitschke, or Michelet, some people that harbor certain \"soul\" or characteristic and share a certain past, are more unique from others.

As I understand it the concept of race as the western world speaks about it today is largely a result of 1) the middle passage slave trade and 2) mid-century US Census surveys' (dehumanizing, etc.) categorization of people. This egregious definition is perhaps seen in a most pedestrian context in surveys in the U.S. where anyone of Indo-european, Iberian, and sometimes Arabic descent is grouped into a \"Caucasian\" \"ethnicity\" or \"race\" despite possibly having no links culturally or ancestrally to the caucuses: Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, etc.\n\n**What are more nuanced descriptions of these terms, and why are nationality and ethnicity talked about as being actually less of social constructs than race?**\n\nE.g. Nations are only nations so far as they are agreed upon. Likewise ethnicity is only an ethnicity so long as the group who belongs to the ethnicity recognizes their cultural practices and have a sense of group identity and the outside recognizes it as well. I.e. these are inherently \"social constructs\" despite them being concrete ideas with physically visible characteristics (e.g. physical nation state borders, types of clothing, cuisine, etc.). \"Race\" is similar in that it only exists as it is recognized, too. So what's the distinction in being a \"social construct\" or not? Each of these things exists only as it is recognized socially.\n\nClearly there are distinctions between ethnicity and \"race,\" e.g. a large number of people of African descent live in the U.S., and only some fraction of them fall into the cultural ethnicity maybe called \"African-American\" which is often referred to very specifically seriously or comedically referred to as \"black,\" e.g. see Dave Chappelle, but without a distinction as to whether this \"blackness\" applies to all \"black people\" or whether it refers to a specific cultural group. I.e. this is racialism taking a specific kind of urban culture and applying it to all people who are seen as belonging to a \"black\" \"race.\" In short, no distinction is made, and the racialisation of culture and stereotypes is wrong perhaps in multiple sense of the word.\n\n Or put another way, what is largely regarded as (and this is painting with a broad, un-nuanced stroke by its very nature)  black culture or coming out of black culture in america, e.g. hip-hop, is seen as something \"racial\" rather than of some sort of black American ethnicity which maybe not all however many million \\~\"racially\" black people in the U.S. would consider themselves or be considered belonging to. In contrast, despite people tending to view someone who perhaps fits into this ethnic group as simply \"black,\" these cultures are not at all similar to e.g. \"black\" South Africans who might be deemed \"black\" as well, at least in mainstream western culture. The same could be said e.g. of first or second generation African-american immigrants, who do not have a shared history or tradition with many black Americans.\n\n**Further, it is clearly wrong to attribute characteristics to individuals based on their \"race,\" If nationality and ethnicity are social constructs for the same reason, is it also wrong to attribute assumed or cultural group characteristics for nationality or ethnicity? Why or why not (clearly stereotypes are bad, but I'm asking at a more fundamental level)? What if cultural ethnicity necessarily involves certain cultural practices?**",

The Aokigahara Forest is a strangely, overly common place for people to commit suicide for reasons unknown. In Japanese culture lies the first instance of suicide relating to trees/forests. \n\nMoving over to Renaissance Italy, Dante Alighieri wrote his \"Divine Comedy\" in the 14th Century. In Inferno, the 2nd ring of the 7th circle of Hell is called the Wood of Suicides. In this ring, people who committed suicide are tortured by taking the form of brittle and dead trees. This creates the second cultural notion of a suicide tree/forest in an unconnected culture. \n\nThe third detailed instance I have behind this theory takes us to modern day United States. An old children's book titled \"10 Little Ni***r Girls\" features a story of ten children who die tragically throughout the tale. In an artists depiction of the story on canvas, he portrayed the girl who committed suicide as a result of societal pressures as being a part of a tree. When I asked the author if he was familiar with the works of Dante and the concept I am researching he stated he was not aware. He simply felt it appropriate to depict the suicide girl in this way. I am including this as a part of Black American Culture based on the popularity of the artist and the high quality of his work. \n\nTo recap, I believe that I have found evidence of the Suicide Tree/Forest in three separate cultures. In recent conversation, I have been informed that either the Druids or Celts of Britain include the Yew tree as a symbol of death. I have also been told that Nordic cultures may also have a similar concept. \n\nAgain, what I am asking is if there is any significance to this theory and if there are any more cultures which may share a common theme to provide me with evidence. Thank you for any help you can provide. ",

This is based on the idea that there is no ultimate standard of good or evil, so every judgment about right and wrong is a product of society. Therefore, any opinion on morality or ethics is subject to the cultural perspective of each person. Ultimately, this means that no moral or ethical system can be considered the “best,” or “worst,” and no particular moral or ethical position can actually be considered “right” or “wrong.”\" \n\nIt sounds like any society or culture can use cultural relativism to justify their actions with no scrutiny or criticism.

        "text": "From what I’ve been able to research, a simplified genetic history of Europe maintains that the original West European Hunter-Gatherers were predominantly dark haired and dark skinned (and also later, blue eyed interestingly enough), until Neolithic Early European Farmers migrating from the southeast (Near East) brought genes for lighter skin, dark eyes, and lactose tolerance with them. Later on, tall Indo-Europeans also migrated into the area and mixed their genes with that of the Europeans, making it so Europeans today have three major genetic source populations.\n\nI found this interesting quote from an article:\n\n“In the far north—where low light levels would favor pale skin—the team found a different picture in hunter-gatherers: Seven people from the 7700-year-old Motala archaeological site in southern Sweden had both light skin gene variants, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2. They also had a third gene, HERC2/OCA2, which causes blue eyes and may also contribute to light skin and blond hair. Thus ancient hunter-gatherers of the far north were already pale and blue-eyed, but those of central and southern Europe had darker skin.\"\nThen, the first farmers from the Near East arrived in Europe; they carried both genes for light skin. As they interbred with the indigenous hunter-gatherers, one of their light-skin genes swept through Europe, so that central and southern Europeans also began to have lighter skin. The other gene variant, SLC45A2, was at low levels until about 5800 years ago when it swept up to high frequency.\"\n\nSo did the people of Sweden develop light skin (aka a prevalence for SLC45A2 and A5) independently of and before the influx of Near East Neolithic farmers, as this article suggests, or was the source of the light-skinned genes ultimately derived from Near East Farmer admixture?\n\nSummary: Were the people of North Europe (Sweden) light skinned before an influx of Near East Neolithic farmers or DUE TO said influx?",

I've even known someone who claims to be able to tell the difference between northern and southern Chinese people. This is something I've heard pretty consistently from Chinese and Japanese people (and I imagine if I had more opportunities to talk to Korean people I'd hear the same from them as well).\n\nI've always been a little sceptical, however. I am aware of how little genetic diversity there tends to be at the inter-population level, so I'm just not sure there can be enough phenotypical regularities within those populations to create immediately recognisable physical traits. I also haven't really seen much in the way of anecdotal success on the part of East Asians around me at identifying other Asians either. I live in Japan now, and a Chinese friend of mine is consistently mistaken for being Japanese, for instance.\n\nNevertheless, I'm interested as to *why* this belief is so widespread. No East Asian person I've ever discussed this topic with doubts that it's possible. For many, it's second nature to assume that it is. One possibility is of course that my understanding of this is a bit flawed and that there *are* noticeable physical differences that are apparent to East Asians. If that's the case I'd be interested in hearing about it. And if there simply is no truth to this, how did this idea get so deeply rooted in so many people's minds? Was there any specific cultural event that set it off?\n\nThanks in advance for any help with this~",

My own field of study is more oriented toward statsy methods development, but I've taught its sister course in human evolution a bunch of times. Was looking to learn a thing or two about non-human primates before having to give a few dozen lectures on them lol.\n\nDoes anyone here have any recommendations for resources to help me prepare? Speaking to primatologist friends Fleagle 3E seems to be the go-to, which I reckon I'll read these next few months, but it dates to 2013 and there's been a fair bit more progress in the broader world of computational genomics/genetics since then. I imagine the morphological and behavioral stuff's probably not changed too much these last ~6y, but are there any more recent summaries of the field I should focus on? (or if any particular work should definitely be included?)? I've a fair bit of flexibility in structuring the course -- the focus historically has been on functional morphology, primate behavior, and the primate fossil record, but I'd like to expand it a little to cover more genetics and stuff too. Otherwise I'll be inheriting slides and lab activity guides, and I have a few ideas I'd like to try out, too (e.g. I can whip up a lab replicating something like [this](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6211/841.long) easily enough, with some modification).\n\nThanks!\n\n(also, sorry if this violates [rule 2.7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/93xbxz/lets_talk_about_the_rules/) here, I didn't find a weekly thread but I did find [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/9e87g5/any_recommendations_for_books_or_detailed/) recent [requests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/9f7y2i/what_anthropology_books_would_you_recommend_to_a/) for [recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/9f9342/what_anthropology_books_would_you_recommend_to_a/), so I hope my request is ok)",

        "text": "I'm not sure if I made the word up just now or not, but my idea is the process of an event becoming myth in discourse.\n\nOne of my hobbies is critical Biblical scholarship and first century Christian history, so I spend a lot of times dialoguing with Christians.  One thing that has fascinated me was how the Vatican II council has sort of turned into an underground civil war.  I imagine early discourse consisted mainly of dissenting opinions and strong disagreements, but the current discourse seems to have taken on mythic dimensions, talking about true popes and false teachings and whatnot.  \n\nThis mythic language can be found in the earliest Christian texts as well, with Paul strongly demarcating lines between true and false teachings, so the legacy is good fertile ground for mythification.\n\nI've witnessed it over here in China, too.  Ask a student who her hero is, and she will say Zhou Enlai because \"he stayed up late at night working hard for the people even though he was very sick\".  I put it in quotes to illustrate the universality of this supporting detail for anyone who chooses Zhou Enlai as his hero.  Political movements in general seem to gain this dimension, especially during Europe's foray into nationalism with the state taking on a mythic role under nationalist regimes or democracies like the United States mythologizing the battle between Socialism and \"Truth, Justice and the American Way\".\n\nOverall, I'm just very interested in how something as mundane as a meeting of cardinals, bishops and a pope gets turned into a Manichean civil war narrative and how this narrative begins to reproduce itself as those vested in the discourse become inducted into the conversation further and further away from the event's occurrence.\n\n  ",
