In theory the cook is the main character, but the show is about all of the women at the school (about 10 of them) from the trainees to the two women running the school.\n\nIt is a very small, quiet show.  Parts of it feel like a cooking ASMR video.  There is understated drama and a bit of romance.  But mostly it is about their happiness in being together and doing something they enjoy.\n\nIt is more a behind the scenes view than about being a geisha, although there is some training and performances shown.\n\nThere is no major drama, violence, mystery, love triangles, etc.  It is just a quiet, lovely show.",

        "text": "Now that The Last of Us is currently airing on HBO, it's nice to have a cool and compelling big-budget zombie show, but man, i don't think this show will ever match the feel that the first seasons of The Walking Dead had (i say this while knowing about the 2 games).\n\nThe first episode of The Walking Dead was a masterpiece in and of itself, with such an grounded, ominous and dreadful vibe.\n\nTo see Rick truly alone in that post-apocalyptic world (before and after Morgan) was so depressing but compelling at the same time, not to mention that the episode had tons of iconic scenes such as Leaving the Hospital, his first walker kill and his horse ride ending with him trapped in the tank.\n\nAnd just like The Last of Us, The Walking Dead was at its core, a drama show, with zombies in the background.\n\nTons of memorable characters (Rick, Shane, Merle, Herschel, Andrea, Lori, Dale, Michonne, Governor) in those first four or five seasons, before the show started having gimmick and caricature characters such as Negan, Ezekiel, The Whisperers, etc.\n\nI know that a lot of people disliked the second seasom (Farm arc), but to me that was a good showcase (although dragged) of drama and character interactions to develop and build future storylines.\n\nI felt for our characters when they found Sophia in the barm and i hated Shane, just like everybody lmao\n\nHerschel and his family were a naive group, but they were also gentle and humble people that wanted to help, so seeing their home be invaded by walkers and get burned to the ground was really sad.\n\nThe Prison arc (season 3 and 4) was peak Walking Dead and at the time, i didn't know if i enjoyed it more than Game of Thrones or not (at the time i didn't watch Breaking Bad), so they were neck and neck for me.\n\nSeeing them clear the prison and make a new home for themselves was a compelling plotline, so when it was also taken away from them, it felt like another gut punch.\n\nThe Governor was a terrifying and believable villain and you knew that whenever he was on screen, the story would be intense and unpredicatble.\n\nI think his presence and sense of imminent threat is what made Season 3 and 4 so great, to know that he was out there was just as scary as knowing that the walkers were byond the fences.\n\nThe Terminus/cannibals and Alexandria arcs were also really good and showed a new side to our main characters, but once Negan and the Saviours came is when the show started to really collapse.\n\nI love Jeffrey Dean but dear god, he was insufferable on this show (not in a good way hahaha), and then came the former theater actor with a pet tiger, Ninja Jesus, Whisperers that cover themselves with walker skin.\n\nBy that point it was too much over the top shit and boring side characters, so having so many solo episodes dedicated to these new and uncharismatic characters started to kill the hype.\n\nAnd it shows, The Walking Dead (although still popular) lost the enormous hype and phenomenom culture that it once was, only rivaled and surpassed by Game of Thrones itself (although i think The Walking Dead was more popular in its first 3 seasons).\n\nAfter season 5, The Walking Dead had a lot of lows, but man during those first seasons, whenever The Walking Dead had a high or a hit, it was good, it was crazy good.\n\nI like The Last of Us (games and show), but i don't love it, but damn, if it didn't remind me of how much i loved early Walking Dead.\n\nNostalgia over.",

The idea of the government being unprepared, turning corrupt and killing innocent people seems to more acceptable if it took place in an era where Republicans ruled such as the Bush era. The idea being Republicans would be okay with war crimes and torture plus lack of human rights.\n\nThe idea of FEDRA seems close to FEMA plus the post 9/11 culture of fear and distrust would amplify in an outbreak. Also the military is in Iraq at the time so it can't deal an adequate response.\n\nMaybe people would be upset if it took place in the Obama years. The idea of the world falling apart in his tenure is too much for some people. Maybe it is so all the people no longer have smartphones. That means though that they all have to have cars 20 years old now\n\nMaybe I'm just being silly.",

        "text": "I just finished **Bad Sisters**. I enjoyed it. \n\n&gt;!The weakest part of the show was the romance between Becka and Matt. I found Matt to be annoying, but that could also be because he looks so similar to Zachary Levi, who I find super annoying. But even more generally, the back and forth of their relationship was so tiring, and the show spent way too much time on it. I was hoping that one of them was actually playing the other, which would have made their relationship so much more interesting, but that didn't happen.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!JP was so repulsive. Kudos to the actor because I was disgusted whenever he showed up. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I really like that, in the end, it was Grace who saved herself and not her sisters. And I also liked that in the last episode, the show played it a little more straight. I was worried that Grace's abuse was being undermined by the at-times-comically-evil characterization of JP, but the last episode really hit home what a genuinely terrifying, cruel, and sadistic person JP was. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!What did everyone else think? Was anyone else left a bit confused about why the other sisters were acting so suspect in the first few episodes if they really had nothing to do with JP's death? !&lt;",

        "text": "Hey.\n\nHope you’re doing well.\n\nSo we know not all characters always make the right decisions because no one’s perfect and we all make mistakes, but what instances can you think of where a character whose a supposed good guy/girl has done deplorable things but tried to rationalize it?\n\nI get there are often shades of grey in shows just like in life so I don’t necessarily judge these people but I think sometimes they may go too far when I’m trying to suspend my disbelief.\n\nSorry if anyone is spoiled on anything, but these are pretty old shows and if you’re clicking this thread you have to expect some shows you haven’t seen may get discussed.\n\nAn example of this is President David Palmer in 24. He starts the show as this incredibly noble, idealistic, kind-hearted person but when he becomes President he slowly morphs into a more cynical person who resorts to doing some deplorable things. Among them is authorizing a murder. You heard that right, a murder. I was willing to overlook some of his other questionable decisions as President because I could accept he had to adjust a little to this new situation and world he was in and characters like Sherry kind of prepared him to exist in a more cynical world. However, his rationalization for authorizing murder of saving hundreds of thousands, millions of lives seemed weak because he tends to very rarely listen to anyone besides Jack Bauer and I think it’s fair to question whether he has the right to decide who lives or dies. \n\nSeason 1 David would never have even entertained this idea and even season 3 David I think it was a little far fetched to me personally giving into the demands of a terrorist especially since for all he knows the terrorist could still unleash the virus and kill these people anyway, so authorizing that murder could have still come to nought. I get he was under immense pressure like everyone on this show and a major conceit of the show was about making extremely tough choices, but it was still ridiculous this President authorizing murder.\n\nAnother example is Tony Almeida giving the same rationalization but instead giving up potentially millions of peoples’ lives for his wife and lying about it and sabotaging his organization, while the bad guy could kill these people anyway. This one was less egregious because he was acting on emotion and loved his wife and it’s a fantastically well-written TV show creating drama, but still sone highly questionable decisions.\n\nA non-24 example is Ross from Friends. “We were on a break.” He cheated on his girlfriend regardless of if he’s right on a technicality. Rachel never slept with someone else but Ross was crazy paranoid and jealous at this time and she was right to dump him. He could have just been a grownup and owned up to his mistake and accepted her decision and let her cool off and spend time thinking. Maybe his intentions were good but his actions hurt someone close to him.\n\nGreg House’s rationalizations for a lot of things were pretty weak, but listing them all would take years.😆 \n\nWhat would make your list?",

Like in Titanic: you know the ship sinks, but the film is fun anyway. But then there's Fight Club too where if one spoiled the ending for you, the film is not as surprising as it can be.\n\nMy main question is: how do I gaslight myself into thinking I will still enjoy said show despite knowing the ending? A part of me wants to believe \"it's the journey, not the destination\" but then again the other thinks my efforts to watch and react to a show is futile given that I already know what's going to happen. \n\nApologies if you feel I'm overreacting.

If no one knows the specific episode, then perhaps if someone had an idea of how I could find it faster and more efficiently, are there websites where I can watch Winging it on full speed, or double tap to skip five seconds ahead so that I can skip to the Serge only scenes. Or if there is an archive of the scripts, perhaps in pdf form so I can crtl+F the words, would be very helpful\n\nthank you Reddit, I am not expecting much but If I do find the quote I will let everyone know!",

        "text": "Ray Barone is the exact same type of husband as Josh fucking Powell!! Yes, the guy whose wife Susan went missing under mysterious circumstances, then murdered his two boys before blowing up his house, is similar to Ray Barone. Listen to The Cold Podcast (season 1 is dedicated to Susan Powell's disappearance, and details the Powell's shitty marriage before Susan went missing) to get a sense of what I am talking about. Both Ray and Josh were lazy, inattentive to their wives yet demanded their wife do everything in the house while they did jack shit. When Ray's daughter is born, he is completely inattentive to his wife as she struggles to maneuver her pregnant body, behavior which is documented by family and friends of Susan Powell regarding Josh when Susan was pregnant. Ray doesn't give two shits about his kids until he sees someone else paying attention to them. This was the behavior of Josh Powell. He didn't care if his kids were running wild in church, or running amok in a fucking shop with dangerous equipment, like saws and grinders. But the moment another adult started talking to them, then suddenly he would step in. \n\nThis show is NOT a fucking sitcom, it's a showcase in neverending gaslighting. For fuck's sake, there is an episode about weaponized incompetence! There is another episode where they go to marriage counseling, and Ray begins to behave in a manner that is antithetical to his demeanor at home, which makes Debra look like the crazy one. There is a manipulative parent who has an unhealthy obsession with butting into the marriage of family members, and tries to cause trouble at every turn. \n\nHow this fucking show was ever portrayed as a sitcom is beyond me. There is a more personal connection I have to the premise of this show. My paternal grandparents were in a similar situation to the Barones, and it destroyed their marriage. My grandma and grandpa moved right next door to my grandpa's mother and her last husband (my grandpa's biological father died at the age of 42). The family found out later she had been married about 4-5 times, when they thought she was only married twice. However, her second husband was NOT Frank Barone. He was described by everyone who knew him as a saint amongst men. \n\nWell, my grandma's relationship with her mother in law was just like the relationship between Debra and Marie Barone. My grandma's mother in law hated her precious son's wife like poison, and mistreated her daughter in law every chance she got. Nothing my grandma did was right, and my grandpa I guess felt powerless to do anything, so he drank. Anytime he tried to please one of the two, it would piss off the other, so he drank. My grandpa's work life also began to suffer, so he drank. And drank, and drank, and drank, and drank. My grandma's mother in law once asked my aunt \"what does your mother do to make my son drink so much?\" Which is such a Marie Barone-esque passive-aggressive bitch question to ask. The behavior went on until 1967 when my grandma finally left my grandpa and married a man who treated her right for 40+ years. Then my grandpa disappeared for 2 years. Turned up on skid row in Cali in the early 70s and only got clean when a doctor told him his liver was about to give out on him. He lived until 2003 and died alone from Squamous Cell Carcinoma.\n\nThis would have been a proper finale to Everybody Loves Raymond.",
