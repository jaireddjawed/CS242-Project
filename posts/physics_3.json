        "text": "I’m just starting to get into physics, having studied a decent amount when it comes to evolution, psychology, and some physics; and, based on my thoughts here recently, have a few questions relating to our purpose and what happens after death. I would appreciate any and all responses\n\nThe first question relates to our purpose: \nis the meaning of life the transfer of energy? \nLet me explain my thought process: We (as in all organisms) are constantly consuming energy throughout our lifetimes, it’s a fact of life. We use this energy to reproduce and grow, the two most important and basic facts of life as an organism, transferring said energy using biological processes. All emotions, feelings, and adaptations aid in guiding us towards the transfer of energy. They are simply byproducts of the need to transfer energy—change being one of the only constants if the universe. Adaptations, while also being a part of that change, also allows us to survive within a given environment, thus actually letting the energy transfer occur continuously. Emotions/feelings act as guidelines which provide the drive to further energy transfer and survival within an environment. \nThis is an overly condensed version of my thoughts, but hopefully I conveyed the point. \n\nMy second question relates to what happens after death: if energy is constantly transferring and changing, will the energy that leaves my body during death and, to a lesser extent, during decomposition eventually become life again—through the transfer of energy?",

I found that having to refresh my memory was such a pain since Geant4 is quite a niche topic and the resources available are not very well organised.  So I decided to take notes and collect as much information as I could to make this process easier for future me If I ever come back to Geant4. \n\nThe learning resource I made is best viewed in Obsidian due to their Canvas feature but I thought that at least 1 of you might be starting to work with Geant4 and would find this useful.

Blowing on the iron again caused the resistance to jump up to around 1.2Ω before dropping to its previous resistance and continuing to decrease slowly. After it finished cooling, the resistance returned to 0.2Ω and stayed there.

However, either there is or there isn't an independent reality (knowable or not) of what happened at X regardless of the perspective of an observer at A or B.  And one implication is that if there is no reality, nothing exists beyond yourself.  What you see and hear doesn't matter, they are just your observations.  But a box is either one foot tall by one foot wide by one foot long or it isn't.  And this applies at all locations and speeds throughout the universe.  But...if it's isn't, if observation is meant to reality, then the result is that multiple versions of the same object exist in the same space, which equals multiple realities. \n\nSo which is it?  Is something there beyond what can be observed, or is nothing?",

The teacher makes me really uncomfortable and back in 5th grade I didn't pay attention to the basics so that's why I struggle hard now. Our teacher  makes physics seem like dry food and that's why I always disliked it as a kid. However, I am incredibly interested in physics now and I feel very passionate about it . I hate it at school and i suck at it but in general, when I read books about it or when I attend to free online  courses... It makes me feel fulfilled. That's when I knew I want to study physics. Mainly because I want and need a deeper understanding of everything and I need truth. I know that I am ready to go through all the frustration and hard work and I know i have the curiosity and right mindset. I just don't know what I should expect from studying physics at uni. \n\nThe problem is that I feel uncomfortable studying it at our school. I even feel anxious. As I said the teacher makes me really uncomfortable and anxious it's almost ridiculous. \n\nSo my questions :\n\n-Is studying physics at university or college different from high school? \n-How are your professors? \n-Are you beginning from the very beginning or is it usual for students to be good at high school physics? Your experience may differ from mine because I go to a German school. Even so I'd like to hear some experiences of yours.",

Does it refer to the invariance of certain properties of the system?\n2. However, it seems that not all properties of the system remains the same after transformation. For example, if we perform a translation transformation, the position vector is changed with our operation and is therefore not invariant with the transformation. Therefore, my question is, what is a link between a kind of transformation and the properties that remains invariant under such transformation?\n3. Why does the symmetries of the inertial frames indicate that the Lagrangian of the system remains the same under transformations?",

This gasket is protected against water entrance using an acoustic vent.\n\nThis is the outcome of my design of the acoustic vent. Can you please review it and provide your inputs on its design?

It is my understanding that light is a wave of particles.  But if the universe was created by the Big Bang, then it seems to me that all particles would be expanding outwards from the epicenter, which to my mind would also mean particles of light.  So how can light from the center of the universe still be traveling towards us? On the other side, how can light from objects that are past our reference to the center of the universe be traveling back towards the center of the universe allowing us to see them? I guess my question is that if anything we see is just the reflection of light waves bouncing off objects, what starts those waves of light in the first place and where from?",
