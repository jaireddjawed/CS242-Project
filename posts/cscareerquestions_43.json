While working on one of my tickets, I noticed a bug on their apps side and during the Stand Up call we're all in, I mentioned I was noticing a bug and wanted to ask if anyone had seen it, and just to briefly describe what was happening. Before I could say anything other than hey I found this bug, my manager cut me off and said that he would talk to me about it and that I shouldn't waste time with questions like this in Stand Up. He never pinged me after and I had to remind him about it later on in the day. This is the second time he's refused to let me ask a question while working on a ticket to the other team, and just cut me off to say it's not the appropriate time. This is only my second SE job, and in my first job we would have small discussions during Stand Up about bugs and break off after if it got crazy, but it feels like I'm not even allowed to talk about it at Stand up.",

Pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Science, which would take approximately 2 and a half years.\n2. Continue networking to find a job.\n3. Resume my search and continue networking to find a job.\n\nA little about me, I have over three years of accounting and tax experience, and a bachelor's degree in accounting. I live in the greater Seattle area and recently completed a coding bootcamp. I've been programming as a hobby for the past 2-3 years, with experience in crypto development, automating my job, website management for an accounting club, and several personal projects. Despite applying to over 200 jobs, I haven't had much luck. I'm starting to think that my lack of a traditional computer science degree is a significant factor in the job market. I've been networking with senior software engineers at various firms, but I'm now considering attending in-person networking events to expand my opportunities. Although I have built good 1-on-1 connections via LinkedIn, it hasn't translated into referrals.\n\nI still have financial debt from my previous bachelor's degree and the bootcamp (totaling about $45k), and I'm considering getting a Master's degree in Computer Science to improve my job prospects. However, this would mean accruing more debt and taking about 2 and a half years to complete the degree. Due to my health issues (severe chronic gout), I can't relocate too far from my family, which limits my job search.\n\nI'm stuck trying to decide what to do next. The only job offers I've received are either unrelated to software engineering or pay very low (30-50k) from WITCH/Revature-like companies, which is a significant drop from my current living situation and salary as a tax accountant (\\~$125k). I've also applied to my boot camp's partnership opportunities but haven't heard back.\n\nI would appreciate any guidance or advice on my situation. Thank you.",

I’ve never had an issue or cared when coworkers blatantly don’t do anything, I just cared about myself, but now I can’t go a week without getting quietly ticked off that someone on my team is clearly working 10 minutes a day and making us all fall behind. I’m definitely not one of those work freaks that are producing 24/7, I’m working at max 6 hours a day (and I never go over that), but like… I get my work done and now I’m project lead and my project is consistently falling behind because of people not doing anything.\n\nI just feel like I’m on this never ending cycle of leading projects, getting ticked off that coworkers are working 10 minutes a day, and now I can’t stop thinking the project I’m leading is going to fail &amp; I want to move up.

        "text": "Hi there, I am a recent grad (front-end developer) with no \"professional\" experience. I've been applying to jobs since November on Indeed and LinkedIn and have had very little success (one or two interviews). Luckily, I went to a career fair before the fall semester ended and I \"accidentally\" discovered the defense industry. That said, I have a tentative offer for NAVAIR but I hear mixed things in general regarding defense (there are many pros and cons). Of course, I assume any experience is better than no experience. Also, I would probably rather work defense than have to settle for a retail job while I continue my search. That said, this job would require a secret clearance and relocation for 3 years of service. In other words, I would have to jump through all the hoops and give them at least 3 years of employment as a civilian. Otherwise, I'd have to pay back the relocation incentive (5k). While working here, there would be multiple 3 to 6 month long rotational assignments that I would participate in that are relevant to my skills and interests (full-stack web development). By the way, the starting salary would be around 80.5k in Ventura county. Long story short, would it be worth it to take this path or should I continue waiting for a web development role in the private realm? I understand that there are a ton of tech layoffs going around and that I am also competing with experienced developers. I figure I could \"hide\" in defense for awhile to wait things out and get my experience. On the other hand, I'm not entirely sure if I truly want a career in defense (I did spend quite some time considering the ethics of it). In short, I definitely don't plan to stay for 5+ years in defense unless I discover that I enjoy the \"chill\" nature of it. I don't even know if I'd make it to the 3 year mark at this moment. I have family helping me out, so I do have a bit of time to \"keep searching for a job\" if I really wanted to and the hiring process is slow to begin with. Although, my student debt has to start getting paid off in the summer. Overall, would NAVAIR (specifically NAWCWD) be a good starting point for a new grad? Have anyone here worked for NAVAIR before? Would I get \"stuck\" here as some like to say?",

Today the code is really messy. I never had seniors to ask questions (the company was new,  I am one of the most experienced). They always hire people out of college, so I’ll never have someone on the team more experienced than me.\n\nAlso, I have the feeling that what they do not know what they want. We are always redoing stuff. \n\nI started to practice and learn after work.  I’m learning new technologies and best practices. I’m reading a lot of books on how to write clean code, how to implement design patterns, security. It is fun when I code outside of work. But then I have to go back to code at work and it’s really hard. I do not want to.\n\nI wanted to change jobs and then all these layoffs blew off.

Is there anyone in the same boat as me?",

        "text": "I work for an extremely large and profitable tech company in the Bay Area, CA.  Approximately 10 months ago, we hired on an engineer into a senior role even though there were some red flags.\n\nThis person seemed like they had a fantastic attitude during the four interviews in which I was present.  I voted not to hire this person into this fully remote role after the second interview because their communication skills, both spoken and written, were mediocre at best.  My team scheduled two more interviews with this engineer, mainly to give me a chance to see that they were hirable and would work well on our team.  This engineer's technical acumen seemed great on paper and in certain moments during the interviews but whenever I dug into any topics in detail, their skills seemed to disappear and it seemed like the engineer was hiding behind Zoom technical issues / communication problems.   \n\nI was bewildered how my team was sold on this engineer... but they were and I couldn't convince them otherwise.  The other two members of my team are all incredibly smart, hard working, and experienced engineers.  Since I was the least experienced engineer on the team, I deferred to my more experienced counterparts.\n\nWhile the interviews weren't stellar, it seems like the engineer we interviewed and the engineer that's now on our team are two different people.  I speculate they had somebody sitting just off screen helping them throughout the interview process.\n\nMy boss asked me to mentor this engineer about 10 months ago.  Me and the rest of my team have been pulling 90% of this engineer's weight in work.  The mentoring process hasn't been going well, especially from a coding perspective.  My boss recognizes this and has been coaching me on it trying to help me grow as an engineer myself.  My boss said something along the lines today like, \"well, they have a CS degree so they should understand XYZ.\"  My boss seems to agree with me 100% that a lot of things are not \"clicking\" like they should.\n\nI was very surprised when I learned they have a CS degree and curiously checked out their Linkedin profile to find out from where.  I was floored when I saw they're also stating they have a CS Masters and 11 years of experience (including 3 years as a Security Engineer, 2 years as a Lead Network Engineer, etc., 5 years as a Senior engineer).\n\n\"Well, everyone embellishes to some extent.\" I thought, until I expanded the section to see what they've worked on in their current role on our team.  The bullet points couldn't be further from the truth.  This individual would not be able to BEGIN to explain some of the concepts they are including on their LinkedIn profile (nor are they things that the engineer, much less my team, has worked on).\n\nThe rest of their LinkedIn profile is just as bad.\n\nI enjoy mentoring engineers but this person misrepresents EVERYTHING and never wants to put the work in to learn anything new.  How should I proceed?  Is there anything I can do?   We never should have hired this individual.  Our interview process should have disqualified them as a candidate on so many levels.  It did not.",

It’s about a 50 minute commute, but with places i’ve been looking to move it’ll be about an hour. Again, not AWFUL. \n\nI have until this Friday to accept the offer. \n\nNow, I recently had a final interview with a government contractor. The work is a lot more interesting to me, pay will likely be better, and commute is also better. It’s the job i’d prefer. However, I have been informed it may be 2-3 weeks before any decision is made on making me an offer as they are interviewing other candidates. This I understand.\n\nMy dilemma here is, I am not in a position to let a job go by. I need a job and the offer I have is sufficient. \n\nAfter talking with some people, I’ve figured my best bet may be accepting the offer I have. I’d start in about 3 weeks. If I receive the offer I really want, I inform the first place I got a better offer and they cut their loses. If I don’t receive the offer I want, whatever, i’ve got a job.\n\nI can see how ethically this probably isn’t ideal but, looking for thoughts here.",

        "text": "I graduated December 2022 from a top 50 university in the US without any internship experience, no personal projects, and started my job search in late November 2022 which I know is really late. While I was job searching I definitely used this subreddit to try to find people struggling like me to feel less alone but instead it kind of just justified my anxieties related to job searching. Although I never actually used this subreddit for anything useful! My resume was built from school and getting my peers to review it and my practice for interviews was at first was yoloing my interviews to get a sense of what I should be studying for and then it was studying material I thought would be asked based off previous interviews.\n\nRegardless, my daily routine was spending around 1-2 hours everyday just applying to all the new jobs with a requirement of 2 YOE or less that came up that day and then doing some studying. I legit applied to at least 700 jobs on LinkedIn and around 100 jobs on Indeed throughout my job search. I did this because I wasn't able to get any interviews whatsoever until the second week of January which is when everything started to kick up again. I started getting 1-3 interviews every week taking literally any interview that would pop up in my email since I figured I would have to take a lot of interviews (at least for practice) before landing an offer.\n\nThe weird part was that the interview that resulted in an offer was completely behavioral and the only real technical part was a take home leetcode type of challenge. It ended up being with my favorite tech stack and fully remote as well with slightly above average pay for my area. It's not FAANG, but it is was exactly what I wanted work wise. The grind was definitely there with me treating job searching as a full time job but I think only people like me with no experience really have to do this. I definitely overapplied and wasted tons of my time filling in job applications as the offer I got was from a job I applied to in early December, but there was definitely a sense of luck to it. I would say the hardest part about was most definitely my mental health and sanity.",

I thought this was weird but figured maybe it’s automated so I reply yes.\n\nI get an email from someone saying here is my screening assessment, and attached is a word doc of basically interview questions that I am “required to fill out and send back by the end of the day”. I find this weird as well, because the email was sent to me at 7:30pm. Like ??\n\nSo I fill out the assessment literally last night at midnight. I get an email today at 6 stating I’ve been offered the position for $60/hr. I have literally almost no experience, and this seems absurd (while obviously who wouldn’t want that money but dude come on) to me. I haven’t spoken to a single person so how can I be offered a job?\n\nI can’t imagine what benefit there is to faking job offers but this has to be one of those too good to be true things. It is screaming not real to me.\n\nHere is some of the offer below\n\n“You will receive your duties everyday via email and I will be online to walk you through your tasks. You will be undergoing a 3 to 5 days online training, via Skype, immediately after setting up your mini office.\n\nWe are starting you with $60 per hour you will receive your pay weekly via wire transfer, direct deposit or check, depending on which you prefer. Benefits  include: Health Insurance, Dental Insurance, Vision Insurance, Term Life Insurance, Employee Wellness and Paid  Time  Off. You will be enrolled for other benefits after a period of 3 months of working with us.\n\nWe communicate virtually for a period of 5 days of working with us, subsequently a user and password will be given to you including an up link to the company server and a list of contact phone numbers to various departments will be sent to you including all necessary forms to fill out. Before you start, you will receive a payment(check) which will be used to set up your mini office by purchasing the office equipment and software needed to start your training and work.”\n\nAm I insane and I just lucked out or is there something very off here?\n\nMy only idea is that maybe it’s some elaborate scam that bounces the check for this “mini office” set up once you buy the company software.

My current role as a sysadmin feels more like software dev because the other people on my time work so much with python, linux, ansible, and docker.\n\nI've also had some friends advise me to learn c# and apply for a junior dev role. He also mentioned that dev roles usually are remote more often, and less on call work too. I know the basic sytax off of w3schools and sites like that. But, I'm unsure if it will take a lot longer and if it will require a lot more to get a junior dev job and if my friend is being unrealistic?\n\nBut, I have had other friends say that it would be dumb to switch to development because everything I've done so far is irrelevant, and I would not be able to get an interview even. And even if I did that I would get destroyed by leetcode and complex math algotrithm and logarithmic regression type questions. Are these things true or is this view being too negative of development? \n\nBecause even with system admin even though they don't do leetcode; I've had interviews where they focus on everything from VMware, Cisco, Cameras, SonicWall, SolarWinds, to roles that are almost programming where they want someone that knows Java, Python, and API containerization. Whereas, I feel like at least development you know what languages to learn to use for your particular role.\n\nSo, should I apply for tech support, system admin, or development roles. Considering my current certs and qualifications. And would it really take 4 to 5 years to get a coding job like the negative friend was saying?",

        "text": "I'm a junior developer. I've been in the industry for 1.5 years but unfortunately I started out by working for a shitty business, a small firm from my country. Since it's really hard entering the IT industry if you've got no background, I accepted the job, even though I saw many red flags from the start. I just thought no one else would hire me with 0 experience and little to no knowledge. I used to think I was lucky in that aspect, but now I am really burnt out and depressed and I wish I hadn't.\n\nTo start out, the environment is toxic. People blame each other for anything here. No matter how much you work, it's still not enough. They haven't invested anything in their business and employees. We still work with dated technologies and, even though newer technologies would speed up our work and reduce deadlines (like Git), the management refuses them and forces us to work with ancient stuff (then gets angry when the deadlines are not met). The firm does outsourcing, and I hate it. I hate how pretentious the clients are, I hate the feedbacks where some dumbass tells me the text is \"1px smaller than what it should have been\". I hate being so restricted in every aspect. I am not allowed to use Bootstrap or Tailwind so I have to write thousands of lines of CSS for each and every project + another thousand lines of media queries. We don't use Git, despite me begging for them to adopt Git into the workflow because it would make everything 10 times easier for everyone involved. We still use jQuery. I've been forced to work with such obscure Mageonto2 libraries that I could literally not find docs for it. I am still paid almost the same amount as someone who works in retail. I have never ever heard of someone earning such a small income in this industry, not even total beginners, and I'm already 1.5 years in. I tried bringing up a raise and I was always met with the \"you don't deserve it\" or \"you haven't proven yourself\" even though I could literally earn more money by doing food delivery. My manager once told me I didn't deserve a raise because I was in the hospital for a few days for a surgery, which apparently \"brought his business a profit decline\". I am being overworked, underpaid, and I don't learn anything here. I do the same repetitive work and they don't care about helping me develop at all. I have declined a lot since I started to work here, mentally and professionally. I am supposed to know a lot of things now, and I know close to nothing. This job has also killed all of my motivation to learn anything in my free time and evolve professionally. So I'm literally stuck.\n\n\nNow you might be wondering why I haven't found something else. There isn't demand for junior developers in my country. The \"lowest\" job openings I could find were for developers with 2+ years of experience, most of them 3-4+. I am scared that if I quit this job, I won't be able to find something else in the industry. I know that if I wait for a bit more, I could reach 2 years of experience in the field and actually have a chance at finding a job, but I cannot tolerate my current job anymore and I can't see myself not collapsing under the mental pressure in the next 6 months till I can reach that milestone. This job has sucked the life out of me and I know for sure I cannot do it anymore, nor can I search for other jobs while I work here, because I am too mentally fucked up. But if I quit this job, I am scared I will never find a job as a developer anymore and that scares me because I live in eastern Europe where there's no career choices besides doctor, lawyer, engineer or software developer, because everything else pays very, very bad. I don't claim to be some genius, I am not that good at what I do but I was also not given freedom to evolve professionally and to grow.\n\nWhat should I do? I feel like I am cracking under the pressure and don't know what to do to not regret my choice.",

By no means am not familiar with CS concepts. I want a job that involves less politicking (at least my job does) and which allows me to have a bit of creativity to reach a certain goal, which is why coding for my career sounds interesting. Another option is Data Science, as I specialised in Statistics in the end and that could help me combine skills that I have with coding. Currently doing trading at an investment bank.\n\nI've heard that bootcamps are a thing in the US but is it a complete waste of time? I've been working for 5 years now (just turned 27) -- is it too late to pivot and what's the best way to go about it? E.g. building a solid GIT repository?
