I’ve never really made a fluid simulation  before so I’m not sure where to start or if this is even doable at my skill level, so any advice would be appreciated!

The most efficient way to achieve that is by taking the shape of a sphere. In a cube, for example, the pressure in the center of the faces is distributed in a different way to how it is distributed in the corners.\n\nA planet is an immense accumulation of matter. That matter produces gravity, and that gravity produces immense pressure on the materials, say, a rocky object. The rock is strong and with low gravity like a small asteroid, it will resist deformation. As more matter is added to the clump, there will come a point where the forces caused by gravitational pressure are greater than the resistance of the rock, and the rock gives way until the pressure forces find equilibrium. That equilibrium occurs in the spherical shape and is known as hydrostatic equilibrium. In fact, when classifying celestial objects, hydrostatic balance is one of the requirements in the definition of a planet.",

(yes, in capital letters, because that's how they'll be big).\n\nWell, there would be no benefit, it would be a disaster.\n\nWith one of them between the Earth and the second satellite, gigantic tides would be caused on our planet, through the violent gravitational pull, 6 times higher than the ones we have. This would lead to the erosion of the coasts, which would lead them to be further inland of the continents, not to mention destroying coastal cities such as Singapore, New York, Vancouver and Barcelona, ​​for example.\n\nThe natural satellite between Earth and the other Moon would be the ham in the sandwich, gravitationally pulled by the struggle between one and the other. This would lead to that intermediate Moon having global volcanic activity on it, with large rivers of lava on its surface.\n\nGiven the size of the bodies, it is an unstable system, these Moons would end up hitting each other, although the collision would take millions of years. This would destroy both satellites and fragments would fall on Earth, and then the rest that orbited the planet would form a ring, as there would be a lot of material, instead of falling it would eventually form another moon.\n\nAnd what about the Earth and several moons?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8z5dd3756m0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=873921519c829b50df26467db4fbb480891a10cb\n\n \n\n*There are simulations that allow us to play with hypothetical scenarios.*\n\nHere the Earth with five natural satellites: Luna, Titan, Io, Europa and Ganymede, with different distances and inclinations.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/deknk5m66m0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26997ac023160ed506d374ed1669a54a20fdfc1e\n\n \n\n*The simulation is running and it looks like a moon lights up, (fragmenting its surface), followed by others.*\n\nDue to the intense gravitational tugs between the celestial bodies involved. The translational movement around the Earth and around the Sun leads to that characteristic spiral movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jifzibr86m0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e415dacaf046248e1ee4531d5c1d5f9f1c0fc57\n\n \n\n*This is like a domino effect, one ignition leads to another and the Earth itself raises its temperature a lot, one of its companions collided with it.*\n\nFragments of other moons also collide with the planet and in due course, the remaining companions of our planet end up escaping its pull.\n\nAs the blue planet cools, well, that color is no longer very characteristic for them, let's say: it has lost its oceans.\n\nBut hey, it is not common for a rocky planet to have significant satellites in size: Mars has asteroids probably obtained from the belt between it and Jupiter, they do not have enough mass to be like spheres.\n\nIt is already a long time that the Earth has the Moon, due to a possible collision between our primitive planet at that time and a body like Mars, Thea, which made our particular stable system and life as we know it possible.",

        "text": " \n\nThe **Kessler syndrome** or **ablation cascade** is a scenario proposed by NASA consultant Donald J. Kessler in which the volume of space debris in low-Earth orbit would be so high that objects in orbit would be frequently impacted by the debris, thus creating even more garbage and a greater risk of other impacts on other objects. As the number of orbiting satellites grows and old satellites accumulate, the risk of this Kessler cascading collision scenario becomes greater.\n\n \n\n[ Graphic representation of what could happen ](https://preview.redd.it/3kekvxkxml0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c92609a9b0fa0ebfa42e5f3b9a9d03fab7e7290c)\n\n \n\n**What happens when a satellite stops working or is no longer needed?** They do not return to Earth alone or disappear in any way. When a satellite breaks, no one goes into space to fix it. They all stay there, they stay in their orbit, moving at incredible speeds. It's hard looking up at the sky to think of anything that might hinder space exploration, but those dead satellites, paint smears, fragments of solar panels, or rockets from old missions can pose a threat.\n\nAll that space junk is moving at speeds of up to 27,000 km per hour and each object varies in direction as it is affected by Earth's gravitational field. Avoiding collisions through evasive maneuvers consumes the satellite's fuel and time, making it a less efficient instrument than it should be. Then there's the fact that most orbiting objects can't be controlled from Earth, so there's no way to interfere with debris on a collision course.\n\nThe danger posed by even a small fragment traveling at high speeds is easy to see. As calculated by NASA, **a 1-centimeter \"paint blob\" traveling at 10 km/s can cause the same damage as a 250-kilogram object moving at about 100 km/hour on Earth.** If we increase the size of the fragment to 10 centimeters, such a projectile would have the force of 7 kilograms of TNT. If we imagine thousands of objects of this type flying at dizzying speeds and colliding with each other... the landscape is truly a nightmare.\n\nFor this reason, the European Space Agency (ESA) has announced a plan to tackle this growing problem through the Clearspace-1 mission, led by a Swiss startup called Clearspace in consortium with ESA.\n\n**ClearSpace-1's primary target will be a piece of junk called Vespa,** which was dropped into orbit about 800 km above Earth by ESA's Vega launcher in 2013. It is the size of a small satellite and weighs 100 kilos. Due to its simple shape and robust construction, it is a very suitable piece for space testing. **It is a relatively light lens and easy to capture.** And it is unlikely that when the spacecraft picks it up, it will fragment. Vespa will be \"hunted\" with four robotic arms that, once in his possession, will drag him out of Earth's orbit, with which the end of both will end up burning in the atmosphere.\n\nSince this is a suicide mission for the robot, the ideal, if all goes as planned, will be **to create a permanent cleaning robot that can expel space debris into the atmosphere without having to detach from the ship itself with each cleaning operation**. It is not profitable, of course. But right **now it is necessary to demonstrate if the concept works.**",

It was first used in 1656 by John Wallis and will probably come to an end in the future, when the human species becomes extinct or begins to use other symbol systems.\n\nThat is, something can be infinite and not necessarily be eternal.\n\nThe universe is infinite in space but finite in time.\n\nIt is infinite because it has no walls or anything that limits it. Nor does it have a center, since the universe expands relative to every point in space.\n\nBut at the same time it is finite in time, since the speed of light is finite. We cannot see most of the universe because it is more light-years away than the age of the universe (about 14 billion years). Light from that part of the universe never reached us and never will because, due to the expansion of the universe, it is always \"farther away\" than light can reach.\n\nBesides, everything seems to indicate that there is going to come a point in which the universe in which the universe is going to reach its thermodynamic death or that it is going to cease to exist in other ways.\n\nThat is, temporarily the universe has a beginning and an end but spatially it is infinite.",

        "text": "I am a third year computer science student who's considering switching into a math specialization called Mathematical Physics. \n\nI know this sound a little crazy but I actually haven't done any physics since highschool. I have only watched videos and read up on topics from a, more-less, layman view. However, I struggle to see myself being content with throwing away the opportunity to understand physics and math at a higher level. \n\nIn my final year of highschool I had a great physics teacher who gave fun questions and actually explained concepts and derived equations. This is when I realized I really enjoyed questions that came within the same flavor as math and physics problems. Applying for undergrad I was still unsure what major I wanted to choose, I had no idea about the type of work I wanted to do or level of education I wanted to pursue. I majored in computer science as it seemed to be a financially safe option that still offered interesting material.\n\nLike I said, I am already regretting not studying physics and math. The CS material isn't cutting it for me and I don't believe a pure software development job will leave me with fulfillment. This semester I am currently enrolled in my schools vector calculus course. It feels good to be doing problems of this flavor again, however, I know the course is pretty simple. Next semester I am taking Introduction to Real Analysis, which should give me a taste of higher level mathematics. Unfortunately, I cannot take physics until next year since the first year intro to physics course is two semesters long. However, I have a copy of Griffiths Introduction to Electrodynamics which I intend on reading, since I have the requiring vector calculus knowledge.\n\nI put a lot of thought into this, more than what I've said in this post. It will take me an extra two or three years to graduate if I switch programs, but I don't mind. I can't switch programs until the summer before next fall semester. I am looking for advice on things I can do to become more confident about this decision. I want to self teach myself some physics before I switch degrees, I mentioned I have Griffiths ED, but I was wondering if there is any other texts and topics I should go over first. I have also never done any sort of research before but I like the idea. If I do go down this route, what is the optimal way to spend my undergrad?",

        "text": "[https://imgur.com/a/n9hxntF](https://imgur.com/a/n9hxntF)\n\nMy friends and I have been trying to figure this out for a couple days now, so any help is very much appreciated. Fraunhofer diffraction applies whenever d\\^2/lambda is much less than L, where L is the distance from observation plane to aperture plane, and d is the maximum extent of the aperture. I attached a link to a picture detailing my confusion, but I will explain here. Basically, assume that Fraunhofer condition applies. Then we have a top hat aperture (1d for simplification) extending from -a/2 to a/2, this produces a sinc\\^2 intensity distribution, using Fourier transform of aperture function.\n\nBut now we know that translation of function in x space will correspond to phase shift in the frequency space (frequency space here is the amplitude distribution on observation plane), so if we shift the top hat 6 units up for example, we will just phase shift the amplitude on the observation screen, but we are only interested in intensities so this phase shift doesn't matter, and mathematically we end up getting the same intensity distribution. How can this be, where am I going wrong? Obviously the sinc\\^2 should still be centered on axis with the top hat aperture, but according to the math, it is wherever 0, the origin, is defined to be, but I can define the origin to be anywhere.\n\nI guess you could say choose the origin where you suspect the intensity distribution to be centered around, but what if its not symmetric or what if it's a complicated 2D aperture. It seems like now with 2d apertures the choice of origin could have a large effect on where we think the intensity distribution will be. Also, for condition for Fraunhofer diffraction with d\\^2/lambda, apparently this can be derived either be looking at rays coming from aperture and seeing how far we have to be in order for them to all be parallel going to specific point. Or it can be derived by expanding out exp(iksintheta\\*r), where r\\^2=L\\^2+(x-x0)\\^2+(y-y0)\\^2, where L is distance between aperture and observation planes, x and y are points in aperture, and x0 and y0 are point on observation plane. Then expanding out, we want the x\\^2+y\\^2/2L term to be much less than pi, so phase shift due to this quadratic term is approximately zero for all points in aperture. But can't we choose origin so that x and y just become a lot bigger?\n\nThanks to anyone who can clear up any of this confusion.",

This celestial body keeps us spinning at all hours of the day; in fact, you're moving at about 1,000 miles per hour right now due to a combination of factors.\n\nWild, right?\n\nHowever, there is something strange in space that does not only affect the Milky Way. In fact, most of our observable neighboring galaxies are apparently being affected as well.\n\nSomething 150 million light-years away is pulling all these galaxies towards it, but no one knows exactly what it is.\n\nLet me introduce you to The Great Attractor.\n\nOf course, moving galaxies are not a groundbreaking occurrence. In fact, the Hubble Flow dictates that the galaxies must be receding from each other as the galaxy continually expands.\n\nThis is all fine, except for the fact that that is not what is happening. Whatever this Great Attractor is, it is so powerful that it has a mass capable of pulling millions and millions of stars towards it.\n\nOur own galaxy is moving towards this anomaly at 2,160,000 kilometers per hour. If the Earth moved that fast around the Sun, our years would only last 18 days.\n\nI'm sure you're wondering why, with all our technology, we can't identify what this mysterious force is. Well, unfortunately, the line of sight to the Great Attractor is blocked by an area of ​​our own galaxy known as the \"Zone of Evasion.\"\n\nThis area is a spooky area within the plane of the Milky Way; in the general direction of the center of our galaxy. This chaotic area of ​​space is so filled with interstellar dust and gas that it blocks visibility in the sector of the universe behind it.\n\nNow the Great Attractor was first noticed in the 70's and our technology was not good enough to see through the Zone of Avoidance. It blocks visible light, but X-ray technology in recent years has helped us piece together a few more parts of the universe.\n\nThis brings us to what scientists currently theorize the Great Attractor might look like:\n\na galactic cluster\n\nI'd like to start with the most likely solution to what this gravitational anomaly might be. The X-ray photos I discussed above revealed a plethora of distant galaxies previously known to us.\n\nNot only this, but two galaxy clusters were found: the Norma Cluster and the Shapley Super Cluster.\n\nThe first has a mass of approximately 1,000 trillion suns and is made up of thousands of galaxies. Now, it's possible that the Norma Cluster is the reason for the Milky Way's high-speed pain through space, but it wouldn't explain the motion of the thousands of galaxies around us.\n\nWhen the scientists looked deeper through the Zone of Avoidance, however, they saw the Shapley Supercluster. This giant cluster of galaxies is the largest within a billion light-years and could very likely explain the motion of galaxies in our sliver of the universe.\n\nMore than 8,000 galaxies create a mass of more than ten million suns. That is incredibly strong.\n\nMost scientists have simply accepted that the Shapley Supercluster is probably the Great Attractor since it is in the region that the pull seems to be coming from, and logically it seems to make the most sense.\n\nThere are, however, a couple of other theories as to what it could be besides Shapley.\n\nThe proximity of the Shapley Super Cluster to other groups gives some researchers pause. For many galaxies to coalesce into several clusters, openly defying the Hubble Flow, some believe that a large gravitational anomaly is a real response to the Great Attractor.\n\nThere have been theories ranging from a supermassive black hole, bigger than we could imagine, to aliens.\n\nI personally don't think a supermassive black hole is likely to be a real solution to the Big Pull. The speeds at which galaxies move do not seem to indicate this. All of the aforementioned superclusters are moving at an apparently normal rate, not one that would be influenced by a supermassive black hole.\n\nAlien civilizations are another common speculation, but I feel like it's scratched by asking the simple question of why would they want to draw all these galaxies to them?\n\nIn my opinion, I think the Great Attractor is caused by Norma and Shapley. Mathematically and statistically, these two clusters combined seem to account for our speed and that of the galaxies around us.",

        "text": " \n\nThe expansion of the universe is one of the most misunderstood phenomena in the field of astrophysics.\n\nThe expansion of the universe is, in simple terms, an increase in the distances between objects. This means that on average, objects move away from each other. However, the universe is governed by 4 interactions or fundamental forces.\n\nAtoms are held together by extremely strong interactions at the microscopic level, so the expansion of the universe does not affect the distance between atoms or between their subatomic particles. It is as if you are walking in one direction and I am walking in the opposite direction. That's not why our atoms are going to separate.\n\nGravity is another one of those 4 interactions. If two massive objects are close enough, the gravity between them counteracts the effects of expansion. For example, the expansion of the universe does not directly affect the distance between the Earth and the Moon, nor between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. The Milky Way and Andromeda are gravitationally linked and are actually getting closer.\n\nWith the expansion of the universe what changes is the *metric* of space-time. And what the hell is the metric of space-time?\n\nThe *metric* refers to the curvature of space-time.\n\nWe can imagine space-time as a kind of topography dictated by the magnitude of the gravitational fields of massive objects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsh4koxswg0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6de2f80580e19acea82e241f0378a40793e4f49f\n\nAs objects move away from each other, the intensity of the space-time curvature in the space between those objects changes.\n\nTo return to the premise of the question, the expansion of the universe is not an expansion of mass, nor is it an expansion of the space between atoms or between their particles. It is a large-scale spacing between objects that are far enough from each other that they are not gravitationally bound. So nearby galaxies may indeed be getting closer to each other, but at great distances, when gravity doesn't play a role between two objects, what you see is that on average, the objects move away.",

        "text": " \n\nThere is such a wide range of prices that it is impossible to speak of an average.\n\nFor example, you can buy a small piece of Campo del Cielo for 20 or 30 dollars. At the opposite end of the price range are Martian or Lunar meteorites which can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars per gram.\n\nMy advice is that if you are just interested in the subject, you don't want to spend too much money and you just want something cool to display in your house then buy a \"pallasita\". Pallasites are the most beautiful meteorites that exist. They are a mixture of olivine and iron crystals and were formed when the planet or planetoid from which they came was destroyed. The iron core and olivine mantle mixed during the impact and amalgamated.\n\nPallasites as they fall on Earth can be confused with any rock, but once identified they are usually cut into slices, polished and voila, we have one of the most beautiful objects that can be seen on Earth.\n\nIts price varies. There are pallasitas more expensive than others. For example, Fukang Pallasite is quoted at around 50 or 60 dollars per gram while Seymchan is between 5 and 10 dollars per gram. Both are very similar, they probably even come from the same object, but the difference in price lies in the amount recovered from one and the other, as well as the amount of olivine they have. Seymchan, for example, has much less olivine than Fukang, which is why it is cheaper.\n\nThis is a sample of the Fukang meteorite\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrc3xukspf0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3845ec9bcf8db87816edc7bd9f46cd438cf3047\n\nAnd this is a sample of the Seymchan meteorite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdhnkxxtpf0a1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3755e2609a4b307db0735345f0a35e6cb76788a\n\nThey have to be cut to identify.

        "text": "I thought I had a good grasp on the double slit experiment: when unobserved, particles exist as orbs of potential (wave function) and therefore pass through both slits and this wavelike potential interacts with itself creating an interference pattern. When observed at the slits, the orb of potential / wave function collapses to a tangible point as it’s forced to do so by measurement.\n\nSo, why do I see videos of people performing the double slit experiment at home with lasers, and the interference pattern is observed? I thought that the photos interacting with air, smoke, etc is considered an interaction/measurement and should therefore collapse the wave function, but this seems to not be the case. Clarification on what constitutes a measurement, i.e. what collapses the wave function and what doesn’t, would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",

It is located in the birthplace of China's aerospace industry - the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology in the East Highland area of ​​Beijing. Pavilion. The museum aims to display my country's aerospace science and technology achievements, spread aerospace spiritual culture, and carry out patriotic education.\n\nSince July this year, the China Aerospace Museum has launched the upgrading and renovation project of the exhibition hall, comprehensively and systematically sorting out the development history and achievements of China's aerospace industry. There are ten sections of aerospace, deep space exploration, aerospace figures, future prospects, Tianwen Shuyuan, and multi-functional halls.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the China Aerospace Museum also built a simulation platform for the transfer and launch of the Long March 5 carrier rocket in the form of a sand table, and cooperated with the large screen to demonstrate the delivery, transfer, and launch of the Chang 5 rocket, so that the audience can experience the rocket launch immersively. On the spot, feel the shock brought by the launch. In addition, space suits and digital interactive systems, China Space Station VR roaming system, and space life exhibitions are also set up in the museum. Visitors can experience astronauts' work clothes, sleeping bags and other daily necessities up close.

        "author": "rishohag",

        "text": "A light year is not a unit of time, but a unit of distance. The distance traveled by light for one year is one light year.\n\nBut conversely, for a distance of one light-year, does light really need to travel for a year? Not necessary, not only does not need a light-year, it does not even need any time, light can travel a distance of one light-year in an instant. Let alone a light-year, even traveling through the entire universe does not take any time.\n\nTo put it bluntly, light is to escape from the boundary of four-dimensional space-time. In the eyes of light, there is no time, and of course there is no space. Assuming that your speed exceeds the speed of light, it means that you no longer belong to the four-dimensional space-time and have escaped from the four-dimensional space-time. As for where you go, that is another question.\n\nAnd we often say that \"the distance traveled by light for one year is one light year\", the \"year\" here is not a year of \"light\", but our year, which we perceive as living on the earth one year.\n\nFor us, the distance traveled at the speed of light for one year is one light-year. There is no doubt about it. Such a definition is completely artificial, and you can think that it has nothing to do with light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63wboqmyrb0a1.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8a9f518b59eaa24193ed0e6f9947e3bd79256d3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the light itself is different.\n\nEinstein's special theory of relativity shows that the faster the speed, the slower the time and the shorter the space. This is what we often call the time dilation effect and the scaling effect.\n\nIn fact, the two effects are equivalent, so they appear simultaneously. Time dilation implies a scaling effect, and vice versa.\n\nSuppose you are a beam of light and you travel at the speed of light. For me who live on the earth, in my eyes, your time is still, just like a wooden man.\n\nBut for you, everything is still going on as usual, you don't feel any different from how you feel on earth, and you feel that time is passing at the same speed as on earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76lh3azzrb0a1.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfeb0a656b7c51aa6110b579b18dbfc32db0fd8c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes that mean you can still feel time?\n\nNo, it is assumed here that you are a beam of light. In fact, you can only approach the speed of light infinitely, and cannot fly at the speed of light. If you do reach the speed of light, you yourself become a photon.\n\nEven if you can feel the passage of time, this feeling is meaningless, because time and space are one and inseparable. When talking about time, you must talk about space at the same time, otherwise there is no meaning.\n\nDue to the existence of the scaling effect, for you who fly at the speed of light, any long distance is close at hand, even the edge of the universe. When you fly at the speed of light, the edge of the universe is also close at hand. You can instantly travel through the universe at any time!\n\nIn this way, time will lose its meaning to you, and you will not feel the existence of time at all, because you have crossed the universe and four-dimensional time and space in an instant!\n\nIn the end, I return to that sentence: the speed of light is the limit of four-dimensional space-time, and any object flying at the speed of light has no concept of time and space.\n\nWant to travel through four-dimensional time and space to reach higher dimensions? It's very simple, just go faster than the speed of light!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut nature just restricts us from flying faster than the speed of light!",
