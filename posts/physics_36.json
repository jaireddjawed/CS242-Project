        "text": "So today and yesterday I've been doing a lot of thinking about certain scenarios involving changing magnetic fields, and I organised 3 questions. Help on any of the questions is very much appreciated. [https://imgur.com/a/UQfdSTn](https://imgur.com/a/UQfdSTn)\n\n1. The emf is defined as the line integral of the E field, and it doesn't necessarily have to be around a loop. But the emf is more useful as a concept is taken around a loop. Is this correct? Also, we learned that the line integral of E around a loop is rate of change of flux, but then we were also told that the electrons could still lose the gained energy as they go around. But if they lose the energy to resistance, it would mean there is an E field over the resistance, so the line integral would still be zero. So is the line integral 0 or rate of change of flux?\n2. In drawing 1, there is a conducting rod moving to the right in a magnetic field. Is the integral I wrote next to the drawing for the whole loop, or from the bottom to top of the conductor? If it's from bottom to top of conductor, what is the value of the left hand side for the whole loop? If it's for the whole loop, how does that make sense, because isn't there voltage gained as you go up conductor and voltage lost as you go down resistor, so the integral should be zero. I can see why or why not it should be either of the two.\n3. In drawing 2 the whole circuit is now in the field. Does the current keep going once this transition from not fully inside to fully inside happens? This video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKbIbHl01NU&amp;t=589s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKbIbHl01NU&amp;t=589s) seems to suggest it does keep going. The same amount of flux is cutting through the whole thing, so why should there be an emf. Now what happens to the integral from before? In drawing 3 is a conductive loop. Surely if this is moving through the field, there should be no current as charges on one side pushed opposite direction of charges on other side. Why is this ideal circular loop any different from the circuit in drawing 2 though?",

Through one end of the barrel, a projectile escapes under the pressure of gunpowder gas, and a small metal cylinder can be hammered into the other end of the barrel. Let's assume that it is an iron cylinder with a height of 1 cm. The initial pressure in my barrel is 48 bar. Having calculated the pressure force for the cylinder flight and dividing it by its area, I got that it takes only 0.02 bar of pressure for this cylinder to fly out of the barrel. According to Pascal's law, the gas pressurizes all areas of the barrel and inside the barrel equally. 48 bar is much more than 0.02 bar. So, the cylinder will fly out from the other end (this end is facing you, so you can shoot yourself, if it is true)?",

        "text": "This could be Dunning Kruger effect on my part here... so please correct me if I'm wrong... But I'm under the impression people don't understand what gravity is or how it necessarily happens. There are people saying its a force... or that there are \"gravitons\" involved... like... actual particles of gravity.\n\nBut... isn't gravity just the outcome of mass distorting space-time? The more dense a body of mass is, the stronger its gravitational pull. This is because with more dense matter taking up space, the space that is supposed to be there has to curve around the mass. Since space and time are connected, this means both space and time curve around mass.\n\nOther objects of mass moving through space-time might want to go from point A to point B, but a large body of mass is in the way (a planet). Thus, the smaller object of mass moves toward the planet, and the gravitational pull of the planet is just the bending of space-time around it, so once the smaller bit of mass gets close enough, it is 'pulled in\" by the curve in space-time.\n\nBecause the mass of the planet is in the way, the smaller object basically just gets \"stuck\" to the surface, since it is not large enough to impact space-time that close to the planet. It can only get pulled toward the center of missing space-time.\n\nI know this has been demonstrated in 2D, with a sheet and some balls of various sizes, to show that smaller balls will roll in toward a ball that is pressing down more into the sheet.\n\nSo I guess my question is... why is there still confusion as to what gravity is? Isn't gravity the distortion of space-time due to mass? Why are we trying to find \"gravity particles\"? To me this sounds like trying to find \"speed particles\" or \"time particles\".",

I dunno just throwing stuff out there) would that allow for time travel? \n\nWas just thinking about it and wondered if there’s any standing for, whatever this was, in real physics.",

My problem is with the singularity that is said to have started it. It annoyed me that nobody I asked could tell me where all the matter that made up the singularity came from even though it's supposed the be the most widely accepted theory. I feel like it's the same as when I ask a theist where their God came from.\n\nThis is probably an incredibly naive question but has anyone ever proposed to use the big bang theory together with the multiverse theory? \n\nI kept thinking to myself, what if the big bang was caused by a collision or an explosion powerful enough that 2 universes were able to affect each other. One with a dense collection of matter and energy and one that was empty. The resulting phenomenon might look like what we call the big bang. Although that still doesn't explain where all the matter from that universe came from.\n\nTo me the simulated model of what happens in the large hadron collider looks a lot like what the big bang is said to look like but on a much smaller scale.

        "text": "I was watching a video about US Navy's indoor wave pool, Mask, used for testing scale models.\n\nInterestingly they explain that to achieve accurate results from tiny models it's not as simple maintaing ratios of length vs width vs depth to match that of the proposed full suze design.\n\nThe most important measurement that needs to be maintained is the Froude Number, and then for camera footage it must be also scaled by non-linear factor.\n\nIt made me wonder is there general methods for figuring out what measurements need to be maintained on scaled down models for any models of real life phenomena?\n\nDo car companies built scaled down models first to test aerodynamics or traction? what numbers are needed to be maintained?\n\nAlso trains, with such huge costs it seems it would be needed, and what are the important numbers here? Do people who make model train sets have to consider these scaling calculations? especially for models of high speed trains?\n\nAlso I read that filmmakers must change frame speed when using models to make it look natural, what is the numbers used and how is it related to size difference between model and real size object?\n\nI'm also just wondering how humans could built intricate and huge buildings, large ships, weapons that fire projectiles, long before that had a lot of the physics knowledge we have gained in the last two hundred years. Also they had extremely rudimentary methods of measurement , mostly just dimensions and time, not load capacities of different materials, or with scaled down boats they had no control of wave conditions and i imagine measuring in open water accurately is quite difficultly.\n\nSo how did they successfully build large structures without these measurement capacities or even knowledge of different forces, vector analysis etc?\n\n\nWhere all these problems solved separately or are there some general principles applicable across lots of things? but flight must be very different to driving on fixed track of limited ability to change horizontal direction , or boats subject to a wide range of conditions of waves, wind etc?",

        "text": "Making a concept simple to follow doesn't mean you have to scrap detail. Sometimes I find that I understand certain topics better from a certain pov. \n\nFor example: I watched a video about the Ricci tensor. And eventually I saw the expression d²V/d(x,y,z)² = -Ruv•V. So I was thinking.... Is the Ricci tensor just the negative second derivative of some determinant divided by that determinant? (yes, assuming the basis vector's are in some changing basis vector field).\n\nI'm still trying to find confirmation on this because it seems like the internet just refuses to answer in some way that I can understand. No amount of Google, YouTube, more Google, more YouTube, and even messing around with AI has answered this. It's always described as how volumes change (so, the determinant of some basis vector's, or the √det[g]) yet mathematically it's rarely of ever described using some familiar volume function.\n\nIt's to the point where I'm like... \"Det[e›] here is the determinant of some basis vector's, or volume. What do I do to this to get the Ricci tensor? Please!!!\".\n\nThe same goes for the Christoffel symbols. They always seem like they're just derivatives of some basis vector's, but I haven't seen them described that way, and so I feel like I'm always missing something.\n\nIf we perform some coordinate transformation from an orthogonal and unchanging coordinate system to one that does change, and if the basis vector &lt;i hat&gt; changes it's x component by 2 as it moves in the x direction, or (d&lt;i hat&gt;x/dx). Then is [gamma]&lt;i hat&gt;,x,x = 2?\n\nI constantly teach myself physics and it's very black and white. Either it goes in immediately and I understand it, or it's like swimming up a waterfall.\n\nFor example, the metric tensor is very easy to describe. You have 2D basis vector's, and so you just dot them with themselves and each other in the four possible ways i•i, i•j, j•i, j•j. These values can then be plugged into a more general form of the Pythagorean theorem that measures distances on any coordinate system. You'd be surprised how long it took me to come to that conclusion despite already knowing what basis vectors are. Everything is always pages and pages of 500 different ways to describe the same thing before you go further into the lesson, or something that's too simplified and doesn't actually show the maths behind it. And you eventually get to a confusing but kind of understandable conclusion that you're not sure about so you trawl the internet for confirmation. And then complain in a physics subreddit abou... Wait a minute.\n\nI hope I'm making sense. Bit of a rant but... Yeah. I feel like it needed to be said.",

The case is closed and we do not have any free will at all. \n\nHe speaks as if this is scientific fact. The reason for his rigid conclusion is based on reductionist materialism. If everything is made of particles including humans, and particles must follow the laws of physics, then we are nothing but these particles following the laws of nature and therefore we have no free will. Consciousness cannot interact with these particles because if it did, the particles would not be acting according to the laws of physics and that's impossible and goes against the laws of physics. Physics would have to be wrong for consciousness to be able to interact with particles. \n\nMy argument: Scientists debate about consciousness and free will all of the time and it is far from settled. If we don't fully understand consciousness and how it works then how can we come to any conclusive evidence that we do not have any free will.\n\nHis counter to that: It is not necessary to understand consciousness in order to show that we dont have any free will. Just follow the laws of particles and… continues with his same reductionist argument.\n\nMy counter: Free will is tied to consciousness so yes consciousness is very much related. Reductionism might not be the best model to try to understand consciousness and free will. Many scientists have said that it is the wrong model to approach the topic of consciousness and free will.\n\nHis counter: Ok then give me another model/perspective that leads to the logical conclusion that free will exists \n\nThat's basically where we left off. My only point was that the science isn't settled on these topics and that there are alternative perspectives to reductionism. I’m not educated on what these perspectives are but I know I have read about them in the past.   \n\nInterested to hear some good counter arguments to his. I know his position is quite common so I’m sure there are some common counter arguments. Also, please point out if any of his or my logic is flawed or misled. Thank you!",

Only people interested in it were research groups, which we all know don't have money.  \nAnyways, at the time, I wrote a comprehensive set of Latex notes on simulating all these methods at different scales. Unfortunately I didn't get to finish my notes, and now I have moved to the games industry (don't ask me why and how :D ).

For all intents and purposes, I am grossly simplifying this, don't hate me plz :)\n\nDeuterium and Tritium -&gt; squeeze together/heat up -&gt; combine into helium -&gt; energy released\n\nAs for the why:\n\nWhen they get squeezed together, they reach a certain distance from each other where nuclear force overcomes the electromagnetic force that repels them. As a result of this, energy is released due to binding energy required. Mass defect and binding energy related by Einstein's equation. \n\nNow  what I don't understand:\n\n* Where does nuclear force come from..? I've read little on this but it seems to have something to do with quarks and elementary particles that make up protons etc?\n* Every time I try to find why/how binding energy reduces the nucleus mass relative to the 2 separate nucleus, I get an answer saying mass defect. When I try to find out why/how mass defect, I get binding energy... but why/how either of those things??\n* I've read the kinetic energy analogy (although I don't actually know if its an analogy or if its literally what happens) where energy (kinetic) needs to be removed for the nucleus' to stay within the radius at which they are bounded (I believe Bohr's radius?) and that this is what the binding energy is... ok then what removes this energy? I've read that it is in removed in the form of photons (so like flashes of light?) and sometimes radiation/rays but what ACTUALLY removes it? why don't the nucleus' just keep whizzing by? what makes that energy go bye bye?!\n* Continuation of the above point, where exactly from the nucleus or atom does the energy get taken from and why? (of course if the analogy is even correct)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to use difficult concepts and thank you for any help!",

I realized that I was mid-range in ability among my cohort but still did well enough that there was never any doubt about being able to finish my undergraduate degree with honours and be accepted for post-grad study. I saw many friends change majors or drop out but I was neither the best nor the worst of my cohort and there was never any doubt that I was in the right place studying something which suited me. \n\nI was friends with some people in my cohort who were clearly much better physicists than me but that didn’t stop me from enjoying where I was and what I was doing.\n\nIn my final undergraduate year I was doing a course on Condensed Matter Physics that was right on the limit of what I was capable of passing.  It was a novel experience for me to be scrambling for the barest passing mark rather than something much better. It was the first time that I was doing a course where there was a significant risk that I would fail. \n\nOne lunchtime a friend, AD, sat across from me in the cafeteria while I ate and worked on one of my Condensed Matter problems. He was one of the stars of the cohort and was destined for the Theory Group in post-grad. While AD was talking to some other people he suddenly reached across the table and pointed to my equations, noting that I had missed a minus sign on one line of a set of work that started two pages before. I knew that AD was not doing the Condensed Matter course and was coming at my equations cold, he was seeing my tiny handwriting upside down from across a table and that I had taken nearly forty hours of work to get to that point on that one problem. I was confident he was wrong and I was right. \n\nIt took me nearly three hours of review to confirm that he was right. With the minus sign the problem would resolve in a few more lines, without the minus sign the working became unphysical and would never resolve. It solidly demonstrated to me just how different we were in ability. \n\nI have had a moderately successful, forty year career as a physicist both in Australia and internationally. I am no longer in touch with AD directly, though I have followed his much more illustrious career through his publications and the honours he received. \n\nEven with the massive gap in ability between us, we both did alright and we were both able to contribute to physics in our own way.",

Is the electromagnetic force equation F\\_em = ((n\\*i)\\^2\\*mu\\_0\\*A)/(2\\*(gap)\\^2) calculated at a single point? \n\nSo if I'm holding a 1 foot metal bar over an electromagnet, I would have to do the sum of all the forces on the bar to find the total force? Anything helps. Thank you!",
