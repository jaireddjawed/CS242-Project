        "text": "I made a thread about this a long time ago (as an AMA type thing) and wanted to take it from the perspective of finding out if I'm communicating with someone from the future.\n\n-How we communicate: She uses a form of telepathy, and doesn't \"live\" in my mind.\n\n-How do you know she's real and you're not just schizophrenic or something?: I suppose that's pretty hard to determine, but as Susan put it, how do we know anything is real outside our minds?\n\n-What is Susan's society like?: thanks to technology (e.g. replicators, robotics) most people don't have to work and there isn't as much of an economy as we have.\n\nHere's the form I always see Susan in:\n\nAlmost exactly like this http://www.panhost.xyz/pfs-t-i.png but eye colors and the age she appears to be may vary.\n\nI would be willing to start a whole community/subreddit dedicated to Susan and her people if you are interested in that.\n\nSusan: Mostly just variations of what pangaea said. Though many in my world would do a lot more like turn their skin blue or even have extra artificial parts. We're not true shapeshifters in that sense but we can do some pretty crazy things. Our skin natural colour is a very pale white due to the lack of light on our planet.\n\n-Does Susan have a native language? How do her people communicate?: they use a form of telepathy which basically involves sharing thoughts, emotions, and ideas through a telepathic link.\n\n-How does her peoples' government work?: She said this for the other thread: \" you could say our government is a cross between a confederacy and a republic (probably more of a republic or direct democracy) in your terms. We have a council of leaders elected regionally whose sole purpose is to carry out things people petition, basically anyone puts up something to vote and if enough people vote for it the council must implement it. If a leader fails to deliver, anyone may start a removal vote.\" Also, all jobs except engineers, politicians, and artists have pretty much been replaced by technology or rendered unnecessary.\n\n-Another thing she said: \"In my society, we have a single culture and a single country so there is no need for war. I think this could only result from allowing cultures to mix and diversify. This happens inevitably, the easier it is to travel and communicate. I feel it also allows for individualism in a constructive way where people have no choice but to accept it.\"\n\n-How long have you known Susan?: For most of my life, since elementary school\n\n-How old is Susan?: Hard to say. Her people live to be older than us (a couple centuries, often 3+ nowadays) but she hasn't really bothered keeping track of her age. But we're sure she is older than me.\n\nWe will try to respond to as many posts as possible. We'll try to mark Susan's responses with \"Susan:\" but occasionally I may forget.\n\nIf she is from our world in the far future: she lives thousands of years after a \"great war\" where humanity nearly killed itself with powerful chemical weapons and much history lost. There were two major powers who were probably fighting over resources. I also have a theory that she could be an admin of \"the matrix\" just bored and wanting to talk to me for some reason in which case she could still be describing her society.",

I checked again last week with Shaun and checked while sober, and these were definitely full grown oak trees.\nSecondly, over the summer I've been staying with my dad since I live on campus during the school year, and Shaun comes to visit for family stuff sometimes. But, the first time he stopped by (after I'd told him I finally posted about this) we went back in, like I said, sober this time, and the clearing is still gone. I said in my comment that I'd ask my father if he remembers it and, hoo boy, I've got a story.\nI asked him, and low and behold, he remembered the clearing as well. He also remembered our overly superstitious mother who apparently had a \"bad feeling\" about the woods and would only voice it to our father rather than outright telling us not to go in there. She never exactly said why apparently, no ghost stories or native american burial grounds, just that the place felt weird. Maybe it has something to do with all of this.\nLastly, my dad called me last night, and this is what's really sparking this new post. He found a box in our old office space/junk room absolutely full of old ass tapes and Polaroids that might have pictures/video of the clearing. I feel like this could finally settle weather this is a glitch or some mass hallucination. I also have plans to visit my mother in the nursing home she's in and ask about this, as well as maybe ask some of the neighbors. Sadly, I'm back on campus right now and I don't have a break for a while, so I'll try to update this as soon as humanly possible.",

        "text": "So late Thursday morning I very narrowly avoided a potentially horrible car accident. I still don't know how I even avoided it. I saw a large landscaping truck heading toward me on my drivers side. It came within six inches of hitting me when another car's horn distracted me. It sounded like it was coming from my right side. I looked in that direction and when I returned my attention to the direction the truck was approaching me from, the truck was about 2' away. It was still a close call but I was able to use my own horn to get the driver's attention and the truck stopped. \n\nEver since then there have been a couple of instances where reality doesn't match my perceptions. \n\nThe first strange occurrence happened that evening. After work, I went to Five Below to pick up a lightning cable for my daughter's iPad. I picked out a white cable, since that's the only color cable I have ever purchased (I am strangely particular about things like this). As I'm driving home, I thought to myself that I should have bought a blue cable because my daughter wants to redo her bedroom in an aquatic/marine theme and I thought it would match nicely. I debated on turning around and exchanging the cable but I was tired and wanted to go home and relax.  I went home and took the cable out of the bag and gave it to her... And it was blue. I didn't consider or even think about buying anything other than a white cable while I was in the store or before. \n\nLater that evening I was going through the mail and I noticed the mail sent to my husband had the middle initial \"R\" in his name. My husband's middle name is Michael, or at least I thought it was. I asked him what his middle name is... he immediately said Ryan. I wasn't even close. I tried to look back through old documents and even our marriage certificate. All said Ryan. I really started to feel insane. My husband told me to relax, I've just been under a lot of stress. \n\nThe most recent occurrence happened Friday morning. I went out to pick up some eggs to make breakfast and a sign in front of a volunteer fire station caught my eye. \"Got Crabs? We do! All You Can Eat: $25.\"  I thought that was a great price for all you can eat crabs and a great cause so I made a mental note to suggest we go to my husband. On my way home from the store I looked at the sign to note the date and this time it said $15 instead of $25. I stopped so I could look at both sides of the sign and both said $15. Nobody was at the firehouse or around the station, and the time between the first time I saw the sign and the second time was ~5 minutes so I have a hard time believing someone changed the signs while I was in the store, and it wasn't a digital sign, it was the kind with the plastic letters/numbers so it couldn't have been modified remotely. \n\nPart of me wonders if this is a result  stress from the accident messing with my head, a nervous breakdown, or even an actual dimensional shift. As a side note, my mood has been fantastic since it's happened and a lot of really great things have happened in my personal life since that happened, and I had been in a bit of a slump before that. I don't know if that's relevant, but everything just sort of feels different to me. ",

        "text": "So, maybe not so much a glitch in of itself, (the real thing happens further down, this is mostly explanation) but more of a 'deja vu' thing, has happened to me more than a few times over my life. I have a dream a few months, sometimes years beforehand with seemingly little meaning in it (i.e. I'm cooking and talking to some friends, or putting a table away with someone I don't know at the time).\n\nThese dreams are the ones I can remember when I wake up after very briefly, but over the course of months are nothing special, in the grand scheme of things. But almost like clockwork, I get these occurances where the exact time, dates, faces and places etc. line up as in the dreams, and I get the sensation I've seen it all before. \n\nBut, it's not like these things I'm doing are things I've done before, or a regular things. They're all unique, even the conversations are about topical and timely things that didn't matter or happen at the time I had them in the dream. So it's not the perfect alignment with what is known as deja vu, at least in the definition I've know of.\n\nThe most recent occurance of this was around the 14th of July, if I'm remembering correctly. I had a dream where someone was knocking on my door whilst I was hosting a house party, around 2:30am (checked the watch in my dream when I was in the pantry, and it was 2:34am). I and some others were occupied with sorting out some more drinks and food for people, so my friend went to see who it was. \n\nThe door opened but I went to get some bread from a pantry in another room in the house, so I didn't see who came through the door. The dream ended whilst I was in the pantry getting the bread loaf.\n\nSo, fast forward to 2 weeks ago. Exact same scenario, exactly the same time. I'd gone to get bread from the pantry, and thus was out of sight when the person came in. As I stood for a second there remembering the dream, I went out into the kitchen and asked my friends who came in through the door. They said I did, and pulled a face like I was pulling a prank on them. They even said that I'd brought the bread under my jacket from the pantry after going outside.\n\nI suddenly realised I hadn't brought the bread back from the pantry due to my realisation of the dream, and whoever came through that door was me with the bread. It troubled me the whole night long.\n\nSo, what do you guys think about the party experience? Doppelgänger or OBE? I can't possibly imagine this was real, else there would be a feasible possibility that I could see the future and have a duplicate of me walking about. ",

        "text": "Oh my god, I've never looked at this subreddit before, and I'm glad I found it, because I have quite the story.\n\nThe first time I was left home alone I was 11 years old. My dad, mom, and sister went to Wal-Mart, and I stayed at home to play on my laptop in my room. I always keep my door closed, and so it was closed then as well.\n\nAfter being home alone for maybe an hour, I hear the front door open. I heard my dad walk in with bags in hand, and I heard my sister talking to my mom, and so I decided to go out and say hello to them. When I do, there's no one there at all. The door's closed, there's no cars in the driveway, and my dogs are asleep on the couch.\n\nI thought it was a bit odd, so I went back into my room. My mom called to ask if I wanted anything from McDonald's. I tell her I do. A few minutes later I hear the door open again. I wait for a bit. I listen to my sister jabber on about some doll, and I hear my dad ask her to carry bags. I listen for a good amount of time before I decide to go out again. Once more, there's nothing there.\n\nSo I'm getting a bit freaked, and I'm in my room again for a few more minutes until I hear the backdoor open this time. There's no voices, just creaking footsteps, and I'm scared out of my mind at this point. I tell myself if there WAS anyone in the house, my dogs would be barking at them, and so I dial 911 and find the courage to leave my room. And there's no one there.\n\nI run back, shove a number of things in front of my door, and I call my mom, asking her when she was going to finally be home. She said they were almost back. And sure enough, a few minutes later the front door opens one more time, and I hear my family, and I go out to finally see them there, my dad carrying in groceries and my mom and sister talking.\n\nThis is only one of many weird things that have happened to me. Any idea as to what was up?",

He lived in a 17 floor student housing flat, It was cramped but he was cool and I crashed there for about 2 months.\n\nOne weekend he left to visit his parents and I stayed there in the flat gaming a bit and chilling. So one night while alone in the flat I go to bed and fall asleep...\n\nI have this weird dream, I'm standing in front of the flat at night with two friends. I'm in conversation with them about something when all of a sudden I see an amazing bright light high in the sky moving in irregular patterns. I point up at the light and suddenly fall backwards with my arm outstretched forward still pointing... I wake up.\n\nI'm laying on my back on a mattress on the ground and I notice immediately I can't move, a slight panic sets in. It feels as if my arm is still pointing forward (straight up now that I am on my back) but i also feel my arm pushing against my side, I can't open my  eyes. \n\nBefore I can panic I feel an arm pushing under my back as if someone is trying to lift me into a sitting position, I feel myself rise and feel the chest of somebody kneeling left of me against my arm. It feel comforting until it talks. It sounds like a voice speaking a language but it is no sound a human can make (no. not even the police academy dude!). It's hard to explain how it sounded. \n\nAnyway, I begin to panic. I'm still paralyzed and I fight with all my might to be able to move, I strain my mind and body to overcome the paralysis. All of a sudden I gain control of my right arm and with all my might and fear I punch the thing that is holding me in a sitting position where I hear the sound coming from (presumably it's face). \n\nI suddenly wake up (again) on the mattress in the same room still feeling my arm pointing at the the ceiling/sky for at least another minute or two. I'm terrified the thing is still in the room. I turn on the light and nothing is amiss in the room, adrenaline still pumps through my body. I get back to sleep after about two hours laying awake, wondering wtf just happened...\n\nI know how this sounds, But It definitely wasn't just a lucid dream. This might be the strangest experience in my life.",

I tell him that there was a mechanical one and that there was one electronic one and he says I must be mistaken. I concede  that I might be wrong because my girlfriend handled what I thought was the mechanical key the entire vacation.\n\nSo I come home and tell my girlfriend about it and she swears it was mechanical. The key changed after we returned it along with my fathers recollection of the key. \n\nWhen I gave my girlfriend the key I gave her the mechanical one because I (like anyone) can be slightly douchy and chose for the comfort of pushing the button instead of inserting a key, I'm saying this because it was a conscious choice. Than my girlfriend used that key for over a week, Actually inserting it into the lock over and over again. There where definitely no buttons on it... And then my father, bought the car and has been driving it for years has a different recollection of the key he gave us and both keys on the table are electronic....\n\nBlows my mind...",

Not a bite was taken, and my phone rang. I walked to the adjacent room. Answered the phone, and after a quick conversation, I headed back to the kitchen. \n\nThe sandwich as well as the plate was gone, I checked everywhere. The cabinets, refrigerator, drawers, the rooms of the house, you name it. I still to this day do not know where the hell my sandwich or plate went.\n\nI know I made the sandwich, and I was quite mad (and still am) that it never showed up. It was the last pieces of bread in the loaf, and I was a day away from payday. I ended up going to bed hungry, so I know I didn't eat it. \n\nI also don't have any animals that could leap up and eat it, more or less hide a plate. \n\nI'm just waiting to it to return, and when it does, I will eat it just to spite it's travels. \n\nHas anyone had items disappear on them unexpectedly?

        "text": "Okay guys, here's another strange story I cannot explain, and has been witnessed by several friends of mine, as it has occurred at a party I hosted. \n\nSix years ago, I hosted a house party, there was roughly ten people in attendance, activities for the night were mainly drinking and mingling, since I was hosting, I was mainly jumping between conversations with guests and being social. We all were gathered on the back porch, for the most part, and everything seemed going smoothly. No one was out of hand, and despite drinking, everyone appeared sober and in control. I had only one drink at this point, as to stay in control and clear mind as a host. \n\nI ended up having to use the bathroom, so I headed inside, to the bathroom to do my business. Here's where it gets strange. I couldn't have been gone for more than a minute or two. \n\nMeanwhile, on the back porch, guests recall seeing me walk from the side of house, open the door onto the porch, and walk into the house, into the kitchen, and down the stairs into the basement. Not saying a word, not making any contact. \n\nMy friend, let's call him H, went inside and proceeded to stand in the kitchen, along with my friend C, and D. I then at this point make my way to the kitchen, to go outside. H, C, and D at this point stare at me and look kind of pale. \n\nI ask them, what's wrong? H, C, and D, tell me what happened, and ask me several times if I was outside, and did I walk into the basement/how did I come from where I came from? At this point I'm confused, as I have been gone for less than five minutes, and have only been in the bathroom. \n\nMy house is a raised ranch, it's not very big, there's only one way to the basement, minus the garage door out front. The bathroom is not in the basement. \n\nI explain to them where I was, and I decide to ask the rest of the group outside if they saw the same thing, everyone did, and thought it was odd when \"I came from the side of the house.\" \n\nAt this rate, we are moderately concerned. My friends aren't the prankster type, and I've never been lied to by them. H, and me decide to go into the basement to \"see if I'm down there.\" \n\nWe head into the basement, down the stairs and look around, in laundry room, garage, etc. nothing, no trace of anything amiss. Just strange. We all found it to be odd, but decided to carry on the night like nothing happened. \n\nThey all still remember it to this day, and nothing has reoccurred. Just a standalone incident. What do you think it could be? Doppelgänger or glitch? ",

I was talking to friends on ventrilo, and after playing many rounds, I grew tired. I said goodnight to my friends, logged off and shutdown the computer. It was roughly 3-4 AM. \n\nI walked up the stairs, into the kitchen, made a right into the living room, and walked down the hallway to my room.   Upon opening the door to my room, I saw myself asleep in my bed, startled, I screamed. I then awoke in my bed, screaming, facing the doorway, and proceeded to have a panic attack. \n\nOnce I calmed myself down, I gathered the courage to walk back downstairs and check on the computer, afraid that I was just going to be stuck in a loop, constantly sneaking up on myself. Quite the opposite. I checked the computer, it was off, left as I remembered it. I then headed back to bed, still afraid I'd see myself again. Nope, everything appeared as normal, and I fell asleep.\n\nI am 29 now, and I have had no reoccurrences of this happening since. Is it a glitch? Or maybe just a complicated OBE? I still to this day, can't explain it, nor know when I fell asleep. \n\nMight be a post for r/nosleep. I'd love to hear your ideas on this. ",

        "text": "Please excuse this post if it's in the wrong place, I just didn't know where to post it, so bare with me. \n\nAnyway, on to my occurrences. So, I have my alarm clock in my room, and it's set fairly loud. It's on a table right next to my bed by my head, so it's fairly close meaning I'd hear it for sure. I set my alarm clock every night even though I know I don't have to, I just really like getting up early. However, sometimes in the mornings I wake up 3 hours later than its set, and it's turned off. Now, you may say it's me turning it off, but I'd surely remember waking up and turning it off, I always do. You could say a family member turns it off for whatever reason but: I live with my grandmother, grandfather, and father. My grandparents don't go upstairs very often, where I sleep. The stairs aren't regular stairs. They're kind of steep, so it couldn't be them. My father is the only other \"bedroom\" upstairs, but I know it's not him. He goes to work before my alarm clock is set for. He has no business turning my alarm clock off anyway, he's not like that. Now, this has always bothered me, but I didn't think much of it. \n\nSometimes though, instead of it being turned off, I wake up late with it turned off, and I check the sound to see if it was loud enough, and it's ALMOST MUTE! There's no way I'd do that, ever. \n\nAnd finally, the day that put me the most on edge to post this, this morning. I woke up 3 hours after my alarm clock. I woke up in a daze, my head jerking to my alarm clock to make sure. My alarm clock was STILL SET. Remember, my alarm clock is definitely loud enough for me to hear. And even then, it continues to beep every 10 minutes after the alarm goes off. It's got me really freaked out. But this only happens on weekends/summertime. School is fine, I hear it and I wake up. \n\nNow before anyone asks, I'm not a heavy sleeper, and to my knowledge I don't walk in my sleep, someone would've told me. I would've woken up to my alarm clock. It's frustrating, confusing, and a bit scary now. Thought I'd post it to see what you guys have to say. ",

My great aunt, being the sweet older lady that she is, would often take myself, my brother, and my two cousins on short overnight trips to the mountains.\n\nOne afternoon, we had returned from one such trip and I was playing outside at her house in the country. I remember standing underneath a large oak tree in her backyard, and it began to sprinkle rain. Now, my grandparents live in a house adjacent to that of my great aunt's. There's a walking trail connecting the two properties together, with the view being skewed from my aunt's backyard by a row of Leland Cyprus trees that she had planted some years prior.\n\nHowever, from underneath the oak tree I could clearly see down the extent of the trail and my grandparent's house further down the hill. I remember that as it began to rain, I experienced a strong desire to go visit my Grandparent's. In synchronous timing, I saw my grandfather walking up the trail to my aunt's house. He was wearing a blue t-shirt, and was walking briskly as if to get out of the rain and find shelter more quickly.\n\nI ran around to greet him, my view being blocked momentarily by the row of Cypruses, and to my surprise as I expected to greet him there was no one there. Confused, I went down to my grandparent's house and knocked on the door. I was greeted by my Grandmother and my Grandfather was fast asleep on the couch. He was not wearing a blue shirt and there's no way he could have been where I saw him.\n\nI don't really have an explanation for what happened, and it has been something that has stuck with me throughout the years due to the vividness of the event and seeing him there, only for the apparition to disappear.

At the same time I hear an electric noise (a kind of sizzling you hear when electricity is buzzing in the air) only it was soft at first and grew loud then stopped. The creepiest part? When the noise stopped and just before the light when away I heard a voice. It was like through a megaphone. It said, clear as day, \"Wake up.\" Then the light was gone. I opened the curtains, nothing. No cars, no people on the street, nothing. Silence.\n\nI am pretty shaken up by this.

Sorry if this story doesn't quality as a glitch but I'll share it in case it does.\n\n\nAbout 8 or 9 years ago when I was around 17 my friend came over to spend the night. We stayed up late and walked to a convenience store a bit after midnight and went to bed a few hours later. The next morning I woke up and decided to take a shower while my friend was still asleep. About 5 minutes into the shower a dime was thrown over the curtain and landed in the shower. I immediately thought it was my friend screwing with me and I laughed out loud. The weird thing is I did not hear the door open or close. When I got out the door was still closed with no signs of being opened. I went back to my room and he was still asleep. I should mention at this point that nobody else was in the house when this occurred. When he woke up I asked him about the dime. He seemed very confused and swore up and down that he was not responsible. To this day he is adamant he did not throw a dime into the shower. And no it probably was not a gas leak or anything like that since I picked up the dime and put it on the sink and proceeded to show it to a few people afterward.\n\nWhat are you guy's thoughts on this?\n\n",

So I have a brother who is 4 years younger than me, and I live in a small suburb outside a City in the Midwest. I prefer not to specify just for privacy concerns.Anywho, There was a boy who was in my brothers grade named Daniel. He lived in the town next to mine, and from the time I was 12 until about 15, my friends and I would walk around my town and his and see him riding his bike alone everywhere and we'd call out to him all goofy, being preteen girls and he'd bike away, or throw things at us, or shoot nerf bullets at us. My whole point with this being Daniel was kind of a townie, always alone and outside and one of the only kids you'd see to wander completely on his own throughout the two small towns my friends and I hung out in. He was notable not only to my friends but other people who lived around me.\n\nMy brother wasn't great friends with him, but he'd invite him to group hangouts with his friends like Halloween, and his birthday, so I knew his face and he's been in my house a few times, just an odd kid I guess. \n\nWhen I was 16, his family moved to Australia for one of his parent's jobs(I don't know which one).He came back two years later to our town to visit his grandparents who lives remotely near my town , visited my brother and his friends and said they were coming back to the U.S and moving to Kentucky and that's where he'd be going to highschool, and I didn't see him again.\n\nFast forward to this summer. I am 19, and I have a boyfriend that I have been newly dating for 3 months, his best friend has a lake house near St. Joseph's, Michigan and invited me and my boyfriend up with a group of their high school friends up for a weekend this July. \n\nWe went to the beach, and I was sitting in a booth, waiting in a Jimmy Johns for my boyfriend to get his wallet from the car while I start eating my sandwich and I turn around to look and see if he's coming. That's when I see Daniel. I was dumbfounded, first, because he looked much older, second because he was with a group of younger kids and I don't believe he had younger siblings, and how did this kid, who moved everywhere and anywhere end up in the same restaurant as me in Michigan. \n\nBut that wasn't the glitchy part. So I sneak a snapchat of him and send it to my brother and say \"Oh my god!? Isn't this Him??\" Met with an equally confused response. I set my phone down, and see My boyfriend walking up to my booth after having come in and ordered, and I have my feet up on the bench and he goes \"Damn, Daniel!\" \n\nThis is not a reference he's ever made to me. Ever. Not once. I wasn't wearing white shoes. We don't watch vines. it made no sense. \n\nI say \"Why did you say that..!? How did you know that's his name??\"\n\nHe didn't. We've only been dating 3 months. I had no explanation.\n\nMy brother answered me half hour later and Daniel was more or less disturbed as to how my brother knew where he was. So I guess he didn't recognize me. To be fair I look a lot different than I did at 16.\nThat's my story! Hope y'all enjoyed it.",

I thought it was odd, especially because my phone was on silent. I forgot about it until I got home and checked my phone and saw it was still off. I turned it back on and messaged Sam saying something like \"sorry I didn't answer your call, I was in church\". She responded \"oh? I didn't think I called you? My phone doesn't say I called you\". So I checked my phone, there was no sign of any incoming calls from earlier that day. No face time, voicemails, nothing.\n\nTldr: My phone rang in church while it was on silent and it shows no trace of receiving a phone call that day.",

        "text": "So, a little backstory.. this is a story my dad has told me maaany many times. Id forgotten all about it until recently, and although I cannot vouch 100% for its authenticity, I have heard witnesses back it up. \n\nWhen my parents were much younger, they had a friend (David) whos family owned some property along a local creek with camping lots on it. Since David owned the whole place, he and my parents and his other friends had access to the best lot which featured a particulary deep fishing whole (well over your head, 6+ feet deep).. the other lots would be rented out in the summer.\n\nIve heard dozens of humorous and semi-paranormal stories about their antics when they were younger, but this story has always been told with a degree of solemness. \n\n\nOn one particular occasion, my parents, David, and others walked out to their usual spot to the dock that extends several feet out over the water. Someone had left behind a large fold-up bowie knife stuck into the dock.. \n\nDavid (being angry that campers were tresspassing onto his private lot) took the knife and tossed it into the deepest, murkiest part of the creek. The company joked about it as kids do and carried on through the rest of the night, fishing and partying. \n\nThe next day they all came back to clean up the lot and retrieve their left-behind gear.. \n\nOnly, the same exact knife was stuck into the same exact spot in the dock. \n\nNow.. its totally plausible that someone dove out into brown, murky, WV waters to retrieve their lost knife and stick it back into the wood.. in the early hours of the morning.. but who would do such a thing?\n\nMy dad says they left it there and eventually it disappeared or someone retrieved it..\n\nThis story might not be as shocking as some others, but whenever I ask my dad to retell it he turns totally solemn and swears it to be the truth.

I immediately began thinking \"Wow, it's FF7 Advent Children!\". A couple of minutes later, I quit watching because it was more boring than watching paint dry and I was so confused because it had nothing to do with the game. Years later, I found out I was actually watching The Spirits Within.\n\nThe problem:\n\n1. The Spirits Within released in 2001.\n2. Advent Children released in 2005.\n3. I wasn't even aware of the Final Fantasy series until the year 2006, when I got Final Fantasy III DS for Christmas, so there was no possible way for me to have known about the movies or FF7 prior to this year.\n\nNow, I know this truly happened, because why else would I have hated Advent Children for being boring and totally unrelated to FF7 if I had never seen it?",

I told him to make sure he didn't pocket mine when he left, so we decided to each use our own lighters rather than pass one back and forth with the bowl.  We get buzzed, and he goes to leave. We both make sure we have our lighters, he leaves, and I put mine in my pocket.  \n\nA little while later, I take a break from Black Ops to smoke a cig. I open my pack, and my blue lighter is inside with the cigs. That's normal, so I dont think anything of it, light my cigarette, and suddenly I realize...wait...I thought I put my lighter in my pocket.  I reach in, and pull out a baby blue Bic lighter.

She was skilled reader and i often seen her with some book.\nIt was summer and hot so window in the living room was wide open.\nAnyway my mother eventualy falls a sleep because of that heat. About an hour later she wakes up and the book was gone. So she take a look around on the floor in case she droped it.\nBut nothing. So she went check on us if we are allright and perhaps explain the missing book, we might took it for fun. But the book wasn't there. After searching flat for rest of the day, the Book was gone.\nNo one else came home because it was locked and the keys from inside to prevent anyone to unlocke from the outside.\nShe figured that we might toss it out of the window or strong wind might play a role. So she went outside and check for the book, ask neighbores if they seen it. But nothing.\nThe search would not be so extensive if the book wasn't from library.\nThe book never resurfaced.\nThe library was sending us reminder with a fee every month for a few years. They eventualy stopped, no one returned the book and no one paid the fee.\nThis story was told many times but over time everyone forgot what was the name of the book.\nWhen i was teenager i was often in that exact library and once i asked the staff about my mothers account if there is some unresolved things. There was nothing unresolved. Strange, my mother stopped visting that Library after she could not find that book. \nMy mother didn't remembered plot, not a single page.\nSometimes i mention this story to my family and i am curious if we eventualy forget about that book. So far everyone remembers the search for it. But no know remembers the book itself. No name, no color no shape like the book was just an item called a book.\nEveryone in my family remembers how she was giving a detailed description of the book, but no one remembers a single word from that description.\n",

You can have sex with who you want, make celebrities appear and disappear, but there's something in our basic human instincts that immediately wants to defy what we understand of physics to fly. \n\nElon Musk believes we are living a similar world, a matrix. He has publicly stated this and given very logical reasoning. I'm surprised that no one has written on how this belief could be a huge driving factor in his success. If the world isn't real, and more importantly, if like a lucid dreamer you're one of the few people who can realize this, wouldn't you immediately take advantage of this knowledge to hack the system to succeed? This belief opens up limitless possibilities. You can learn more than you think, sleep less than you need, and push the boundaries of knowledge.\n\nI don't think it's a coisidence SpaceX is making such great leaps to help us fly.\n\n\n\nEdit tl;dr   If you're a Sim that knows you're a Sim, it's going to be a lot easier for you to find a way around a fucking chair placed in front of you in a hallway.",

Flying around in patterns that bugs would except they are a pink color that I can barely explain and bright like tiny balls of light. Like VIBRANT neon pink. I guess \"glitter in the wind\" would be somewhat of a way to describe it too?  I see them at the least once a month at random. I can look all around and just watch them. Its mesmerizing and I get super calm. \n\nWhen my oldest daughter turned 13 she came to me freaking out about seeing lights all around her one night but bright yellow. I immediately knew what it was and at that point thought maybe something was wrong with my eyes and it was genetic. I had read that similar things can happen with retinal detachment and/or floaters although floaters are not rainbow colors. \n\nI made us both optometrist appointments shortly after. We and our eyeballs checked out fine and our eye doctor had no idea what the hell i might be talking about. \n\nIts been 3 years since my daughter has been seeing them now. She loves it as much as i do. Its almost like a treat. They last about 30 seconds and then slowly fade out until im following one around. \n\nIn my life I have tried to see if this happens more in certain situations or areas. I would say 80% of the time im alone in the shower. But the other 20% I can be anywhere in any climate at any time of day. My daughters is completely random. She hasnt noticed any pattern to hers whatsoever. \n\nMy other 2 kids apparently dont see this. I have never brought it up and I'm sure if they saw it they would tell me. \n\nAnyone have ANY ideas? As a kid i just KNEW this was me seeing my \"spirit guide\" but the older I get I just dont know. My mom always called it angels. At this point in my life i am not sure where i stand on the religion front. I feel im spiritual and connected though. Are we seeing something we shouldn't? Through the veil so to speak? Would love to hear thoughts! \n\nTL;DR my daughter and I see neon colored lights or glitterly whatever that resemble fireflies at random times in the air. Its cool as shit. My eyes are fine. I dont do drugs. Im currently having a beer. ",

Same thing, my reflection is wearing a plain black t-shirt.\nI take another step forward, pause again, look down to make sure I am wearing the shirt I knew I put on that morning.

        "text": "This happened about one year ago and unfortunately I will never forget it. \n\n\nI had fallen asleep as normal one night and slept without waking through the night for once, I remember having a terrifying dream though. I was staying at what appeared to be a large manor style house with my boyfriend, his niece Amber, his younger sister Ella and her girlfriend Courtney. My boyfriend was sharing a room with his older brother while Ella and Courtney had their own room and I shared a room with Amber. I remember hanging out with Ella, Courtney and Amber that evening and Ella told a story about the house. \nThe story was when you turn off the lights if you see the girl you're going to die. Freaked out but just thinking it was a story everyone went to bed. I turned out the light in mine and Ambers bedroom and that's when I saw her. Immediately turning the light back on I turned around to look at Amber laid in bed. \n\"Please tell me you saw that?\" I whispered. \n\"Saw what?\" She asked puzzled. \"Did you see her?\" Her voice was shaking now. \nI ran to Ella's room and pounded on the door telling her what was going on. She opened the door with a concerned look on her face. \n\"The story isn't real Zara, it was a joke\" she looked at me horrified. Then the dream ended. \n\n\nI awoke to a loud bang downstairs. I opened my blurry morning eyes and noticed my door was open, this confused me as I always close my door on a night. I rubbed my eyes and quickly checked my phone for the time. 7am. I swung my legs over the side of my bed and sat up my eyes closed as my body ached badly (I have an illness in which my body hurts constantly) I sat there for a moment considering going back to sleep, but as I opened my eyes again I was met with the destruction of my room. All of my drawers were open and everything in them had been thrown all over my floor. \nAll of a sudden I heard another bang that sounded very close, I knew where it was coming from. \nI jumped up and ran to the top of the stairs where I stopped dead in my tracks and stared down at the mess. \nWe have a small cupboard in the corner at the bottom of the stairs full of old VHS tapes and to my astonishment they were all over the floor too. \nI turned around to run into my grandparents room to tell them someone was here and that's when I noticed their door was already open and I could see the light of day shining into their room. \nI walked in to find no one, a freshly made bed and the curtains wide open. At that moment I remembered it was Sunday, they wake up early to get ready for church... but it was 7am! They usually wake up around 7, grandad goes to a church meeting then comes home at 9 and they leave about 9.20am. \nI panicked and immediately thought of my grandma (who is very ill) my first thought was if there was an intruder in the house my grandma would be downstairs alone. I ran downstairs as I heard movement in the kitchen. I walk into the living room slowly peering around the door at my grandmas chair then towards the conservatory and lastly into the kitchen. My grandma wasn't here, no one was here. That's when I stepped completely through the door and started walking into the kitchen. \nThere, stood by the front door, was the woman from my dream. She looked at me and smiled a sickly sinister smile. Startled I jumped back slightly. \n\"You're her\" I barely managed to say. \nShe continued to smile. My whole body became overwhelmed with fear and helplessness. I've never felt so close to death in my life. \n\"You're not going to let me leave are you?\" I stared at her evil smile. \"Am I going to die?\" I asked. My eyes filled with the sting of tears welling up. I refused to close them. My entire being felt as though it was being taken over, like I was losing my grip on life, it is so hard to explain. Almost like I was slipping away and I couldn't stop it. Tears fell as she nodded at me. This is it, I thought. I don't want to die, my mind kept repeating. \nI closed my eyes as I accepted my end and this is the part I cannot fucking fathom for the life of me... \n\n\nI woke up and to my disbelief my legs were hanging off of the side of my bed. \nIt was as though someone had grabbed my legs and put them in that position. My back was aching from this position, I must have been laid like this a while. I was laid on my back and my torso twisted to the right as my legs drooped over the side. \n\n\n\nI freaked out as I remembered I had sat up on the edge of my bed the first time I thought I had woken up. Immediately I pulled my legs back under the covers, tight to my body and looked at my phone. 8am. \nOne.. Hour... Later. \n\n\nI know what happened was real. I cannot explain to you how I know this, it's a feeling I have. It's almost as if I experienced it and they have tried to make me believe it was a dream. \n\n\nI don't know how to feel about it and I still feel unsettled on a night. Just typing this has overwhelmed me with those feelings again, but I needed to share this. \n\n\nI don't know who she was or what she wanted. I don't know the purpose of it all, but I remember it as though it happened yesterday. \n\n",

Saturday night, I went out with my friend from college, A (not my best friend I mentioned earlier, who I will call D for all intents and purposes from this point forward). Since I'd moved out of the city, I hadn't actually gotten to see D in almost two weeks, and his presence was sorely missed--but, I was out on a Saturday night with this college friend, and not really thinking about him in any other capacity but, \"Oh my GOD the stories I'm going to tell him about these people I met tonight.\"\n\nA and I smoke a bowl, it's pretty good weed--the kind that makes you think you're really clever, if you know what I mean *at all*. Once home, I pass out on the couch--nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nMy dream, however, was...if only, because it was *so very ordinary*. In my dream, D and I are hanging out, and it's night time. We're doing what we always do when we hang out at night--going around, from house to house and bar to bar, just visiting with people. At some point in the dream, D even decides to pick up a substance from some guy he know's house, and I have to awkwardly sit in the living room with his roommates while he talks to some guy. It was all very, *very* normal for what I would find out to be a Sunday night.\n\nI would find out that it's Sunday because, in my dream, D has now said that he had a \"fucking *crazy* Saturday night.\" He kept repeating it, over and over. \"Last night was crazy. It was *fucking crazy* for a Saturday.\" Stuff like that. What's odd, is that in a dream, phrases repeat over and over again and you normalize it. Things flit in and out of realistic, and you don't realize, you just rationalize it at the time, because you don't know it's a dream. But, at the time, I remember thinking, \"that's odd, he's repeating that a lot. I get it, dude, it was *fucking crazy*.\"\n\nAnd he kept repeating stuff about a wedding. *Wedding*. *This wedding should have been planned*. I didn't know what he meant at the time, it sounded like he was talking to me through a phone--all of a sudden, he was talking to me through a phone, in the dream. It was like, blacking out while drinking. And at the time, I was drinking. Because, remember, dream-me was partying with my best friend. It was exactly how you lose time in real-life--suddenly, you're somewhere else, doing something else, and it's not weird at all, because you were actually conscious that whole time, you just don't really remember it now. It wasn't like a dream-skip, it was a drink-skip...dream-me had reasoned. I was talking to D through the phone, as he said to me how he \"started a new contract in the morning\" (he's a P.A. in the film industry). I told him to come pick me up, because I needed to come home, and said he couldn't and he'd catch up with me later...but, \"don't forget, my Saturday was *fucking crazy*.\" Yeah, *okay*.\n\nAnd just like that, D was no longer in my dream. It was seriously *exactly* how your drunken night out might go--lose contact with your friend, and don't see him again. I decided to just keep walking through the landscape of my town at night, in my dream. Everything beyond this point got really specific, and I would interpret it to be normal dream-stuff that told me something about my life as it stands at this point...but one other detail would stand out. Dream-me ran into a long-haired British guy, with a really cute smile. I told him in the dream that his accent was \"really charming.\" He thanked me, with a laugh. It's odd that anyone interesting from another country would live in my city, since we're not really a mecca of activity, but I did not question why he was there, sitting on a porch in the dream landscape of an up-and-coming neighborhood in our town. He looked at me and said something about how one of my friends had added him on Facebook, so I should easily be able to find him. Following that, he marveled at how it was \"so easy for the guy to find me, yeah?\" and \"you wouldn't believe the bother it is to add people from another country on Facebook. If you have mutual friends, *sure* it's doable, but Jesus it's difficult finding someone from another country on Facebook when you've no mutual friends.\"\n\nWaking up gave me great pause. While I glean wisdom from dreams often, this was an odd one. Why would I know anything about adding people from Europe on Facebook? I have a few friends from other countries on Facebook, but we *do* have a lot of mutual friends. I had never really thought about it but, *yeah, I guess it would be a pain to find someone from another country on Facebook*. \n\nThis brought the whole hangout with D back. In my real life, it was now Sunday morning. In my dream, we were hanging out on Sunday night...but, he would talk about Saturday night being crazy, and about \"starting a new job in the morning\". I had no real indication of time of importance, or anything at all...but I thought to myself, *I'd better call D*.\n\nIf you've had a dream about a friend, it usually merits a phone call to your friend to tell them about how fucking *wacky* it is--but, D knows I have wacky dreams. The reason I called him at all, was because it was *frightfully normal*. Weed has given me vivid dreams, but this particular incident was some downright crazy normalcy. Just a dream where I walked around the city at night with my best friend, then he went home for work in the morning. I stayed out, now I woke up. I told him the details, and made a point of bringing up how he made a *point* of saying how \"fucking crazy his Saturday night was\"\n\nThere was a long pause. He laughed, \"you must have been *supposed* to call me, because last night *was* fucking **crazy**.\"\n\nHe starts off into this long tirade about DJ'ing a party, how he went somewhere with his one friend to assist at a reception. He's droning on about some details that I, honestly as I feel like a terrible friend to admit, tuned out until I hear him say *this wedding should have been planned,* and I had to talk to the wedding planner! Why would I have to do that?\"\n\n**Back up.** \"Did you just say wedding planner?\"\n\nEverything clicked. His Saturday was fucking crazy, he was telling me how *fucking crazy* Saturday night was, and now D's in-dream rambling about wedding and wedding planning made sense--in the real world, he had to deal with a wedding planner on a wedding he wasn't even supposed to be DJ'ing in the first place. He tagged along to help a friend, and ended up having a wacky night...but why was that even included in my dream? How did I know that ahead of time?\n\nSo I ask what he's doing, maybe we can hang out?\n\n\"I can't, I'm on a new contract today. Standing in my new office. It's weird, I wanted to call you, because this is honestly terrifying--I've never had an office before. I'm really glad you did first.\"\n\nThis dream led to us talking on the phone for like two hours while he set up his new office--we hadn't been out of contact for that long before, so it was odd that we went two weeks-ish without talking...and now this conversation was off and running. D called me his \"cosmic buddy\" for the rest of the day. (lol)\n\n...So, /r/GlitchInTheMatrix, I have no idea what to make of any of this. It's almost like we hung out in an alternate dimension where his contract started on *Monday* instead of Sunday, or where the time I spent sleeping--since I got home at 2am, would have been us hanging out in the city instead, in the wee-hours of Sunday morning. Why did I know he had a crazy Saturday and went to a wedding? I wasn't on his Facebook, I saw no mention of it. When he and I discussed it, he said it was super-last minute and he hadn't planned it.\n\nDoes this mean I'm destined to meet a random British dude with a charming accent who will rant at me about Facebook? Time will tell.\n\n**TLDR: I dreamed that my best friend and I just had a normal hangout, where he told me about his Saturday night, mentioned a wedding planner, and his new job contract. Woke up and called him--those three things turned out to have actually happened, and I have no idea how I managed to know about it without talking to him. It freaked him out a lot (in a good way) and led to us finally having a long phone conversation to catch up.**",

        "text": "My family decided to up and move to Denmark when i was 11, due to my dad being Danish and missing his family. We moved there part way through the school year so i had only been in the country and learning Danish for around 7 months when we had to go on a end of year class trip for the weekend. I was not exactly a fit kid, i preferred to sit somewhere and read a book or listen to some music so i wasn’t exactly over joyed that i had to take part in a five hour bike ride out to some lodge with a load of kids i couldn’t speak to or understand due to the language barrier of me only speaking the most basic Danish and them the most basic English. \n\n We started off from the school at 8AM on a Friday, just as the rest of the school was going in for their normal classes. I met up with a friend, Henriette, who spoke slightly better English than everyone else, in the bathroom and we went out to the back of the school where our bikes were to meet up with everyone else. The teachers gave us basic instructions on where we were going in case anyone got separated and then we got going. \n\n I fell behind pretty much immediately. It was hot and up until moving to Denmark I’d ridden a bike maybe six times in my life. Luckily for me, Denmark is really flat so even though i was trailing far behind my class mates, i could see their shapes way ahead so i at least wouldn’t get lost. \n \n Eventually though, it got a bit much for me. I hadn’t had any breakfast and, despite drinking plenty of water, i was too hot and starting to feel dizzy and nauseous. I pulled over to the side of the road and sat down under some shade, pulling a book out of my bag to read for a bit and recuperate. This bit is kind of important, little 11 year old me was reading the third Twilight book (don’t judge me please, i was 11!) and while sat under that tree in the shade at around 10AM, i read all about Bella punching Jacob in the face, breaking her hand, and a little further. \n\nI sat there for probably about 2 hours and when i got back on my bike, i checked the time and saw it to be 12:30-ish. This meant that my class would very nearly be at the lodge so i took off at full speed, which probably wasn’t all that fast. I got to the lodge and checked the time, it was around 3:40 i remember. Everyones bikes were out front so i knew it was the right place and because it was just starting to cool down, i chained my bike up and went straight in. At the time, i kept the chain on my back packs top handle when it wasn’t on my bike. \n\n I went in the lodge and looked around but couldn’t find anyone. I checked every room, even the boys bathroom (the lodge was specifically for school so half was for the boys, half for the girls). No one was there, no ones stuff was there, apart from the furniture it was completely empty. Confused, i headed back outside where i saw that all the bikes, including my own were gone. At this point in my ‘wtf’ moment, i see my class riding towards me, one of the teachers wheeling my bike along next to her. \n\nI asked her what she was doing with my bike and they said they found it at the side of the road a few hours into the ride and assumed i’d gotten a ride off someone or started walking. I just shrugged and pretended that had happened because i was confused and not really enjoying the attention i was getting from my whole class. The teacher asked a few questions about what i had been doing, who had given me a ride, and then i squirmed away. \n\nAs everyone chained their bikes up i checked my phone (a hand me down nokia from my older brother that only had phone call and text functions, no internet and that snake game that i adored) only to see that it was 1PM. I also realised in this time that my bike chain had vanished. \n\nI was obviously as confused as i could possibly be by that point, i had only started riding towards the lodge at 12:30 and when i had started i had only been two hours tops into the trip. In no possible way did i do a 5 hour ride in half that time. I followed all the other girls into the room and found my bed, the pulled my book out to start reading again. I had only read maybe two sentences when i realised my bookmark had been way back in the book where i had left off the previous night before bed. It was as though i had never stopped to read earlier on. \n\nEventually we were all called to eat lunch and then we did normal school trip things. Played games, chatted, had a camp fire, and eventually went to bed. It was only as i climbed into bed that i realised the entire time i had been at the lodge, i had been speaking flawless Danish to everyone. \n",

It's not been all bad though because for better or worse the majority of my old gang still lived in town. I should add when I say gang I mean the guys I spent my teens playing D&amp;D and bumming around with not like a street gang lol.\n\nI arranged a drink with everyone and we met up in the same bar we used to frequent. I swear the place hadn't changed in the years since I left, in spite of many laws requiring it to. It was nice though I caught up with everyone and we got talking about old times and before we knew it we had all had a skinful it was time to leave. We stumbled out into the street and said our goodbyes, wished each other well and said we'd do it all again next week. Nothing strange at all as I walked off making as straight a path as I was able to home. \n\nAs I was walking I heard someone running up behind me and turned to see Matt, one of my friends, trying to catch up to me. I stopped and waited for them and when they caught up they told me they had decided not to stay at our other friend’s house so was going to walk back with me as they lived close to my new place. As we got near our houses he stopped me and asked if I want to go chill and talk about the family stuff that brought me back. I told him I'm fine but then he says we can go and hang out at the park up the road. \n\nI froze up when he said this. I wasn't sure what to say or how to respond and I think I got as far as stuttering out \"but\" a couple of times before he told me it doesn't matter if I don't want to talk and changed the subject. I was drunk and I was really confused for the rest of the short walk home and barely managed to say goodnight when I headed into my house. I need to add at this point that I have no desire to go near that park area again and as far as I knew neither should any of my friends.\n\nIt's a very long story but I'll try and condense it as best as possible. The park in question backs onto some fields and has a path leading into a forest. It's basically the edge of the town. Growing up I remember the kids telling stories about the park, that at night the swings would swing by themselves and that after dark the park belonged to ‘them’. We never really asked who ‘they’ were but over the years the stories became more detailed and people would say that the forest up the path was home to some kind of spirits or fairies and at night they played on the park. \n\nI won’t bore you with all the details of how it came about but one weekend in our teens we decided we would all go up the path to the forest at night and investigate. So in the dead of a Saturday night a bunch of D&amp;D playing dumbasses armed with sticks and a pair of nunchucks sat around on the town side of the park trying to build up the courage to walk up the path. I should mention that the swings on the park genuinely were swinging on their own at this point but we had blamed this on the wind.\n\nEventually we began to make our way up the path. The path is very claustrophobic at the best of times as it is bordered with tall plants that lean over totally blocking out the sky at some points. And it should go without saying that we were very uneasy as we made our way along. We started hearing strange sounds around what we called the witches pond. I’m not sure why it’s called that but honestly it’s just a ditch that’s usually filled with water at the side of the path with an old mostly dead tree sticking out the middle. We brushed off the sounds as just the old tree creaking in the wind though none of us really believed that and carried on up the path. Things lightened up a little as the path opens out to fields on one side before you get to the forest.\n\nWe spent another few minutes in that area stood staring into the forest just shining our torches up through the small gap in the trees that was the entrance to the forest. We made our way in and I the thing I remember most about this part was the silence. From the moment we set foot into the forest it was as if someone had muted the ambient sounds, I was on edge and my senses were working overtime yet I couldn’t hear even the faintest rustle of leaves in the breeze. The silence was only broken by the occasional twig or branch broken underfoot as we made our way into the forest.\n\nWe knew the forest pretty well as we had walked around during the day to prepare for this and we made our way to a little sort of hut that used to sit in the middle. We were probably about half way there when everything just went crazy. James, who was at the head of the group suddenly jumped back falling into everyone. He was making a quite sort of gasping sound that was basically him trying to scream but being too afraid. Those of us who he hadn’t knocked over quickly pointed our flashlights to where he had been looking and barely managed to keep it together ourselves. In the middle of the path was a figure standing with their back to us. They looked around 5 and a half feet tall and were wearing a blue hoody with the hood up and jeans.\n\nI think at this point we would have ran were it not for the fact that we were all in some way or another holding on to someone else, or lay on someone else for the people who James had landed on. We froze for what felt like hours before realising that the figure hadn’t moved despite having torches trained on him. I’m not sure who spoke but one of our party managed to splutter out “hello?” Another few minutes passed and everyone was back on their feet when Matt unable to deal with the tension any more started making a wide circle around the figure asking what they were doing. He got no response and when he got in front of him his face changed to mixture of relief and confusion. \n\nHe beckoned us all to come closer and as we began to walk over the figure collapsed to the ground. We all had our torches trained on it at this point as after it fell we realised it was just clothes stuffed with leaves. We all felt that same sense of relief and confusion although the relief was short lived as after staring at this pile of leaves for a few moments there was another sudden sound as someone turned around and took a sharp breath. I was still looking at the pile at the time but I looked up as I felt someone rapidly tapping on my shoulder. Everyone was in a state of panic at this point as our torches were just flashing around the tree line at the edges of the path and we could see all around us a few feet off the path some standing in the open some seeming to lean out from behind trees, all dressed in clothes and all looking like they were made of leaves.\n\nWe were all in a panic and these things seemed to be moving, I know I saw one that was leaning out from behind a tree was stood in plain view after I moved the torch away and brought it back to it. I’m not sure how long this went on for but as they seemed to be getting closer the terror took over and we ran, total self-preservation took over and it was every man for themselves as we barrelled back down the path to where we had come into the forest. As I ran I stupidly looked back and when I turned back forward planted myself head first into a tree. I was totally dazed but somehow managed to get back to my feet and follow the others out of the wood. \n\nThe guys had waited for me in the open area by the entrance and I re-joined the group and still dazed the guys helped me as we all rushed back down the path to the park. It was all downhill and we made it back to the park pretty quickly and could see the street lights. We started to feel safer until we realised that sat swinging on the swings in the park were two small figures and shining the torch over we saw two sets of children’s clothes clearly stuffed with leaves. \n\nWe ran once again. Heading up the road back into town. Now under street lights I realised what I thought had been sweat I was wiping off my head was actually blood. We were a little way into town and everyone re-grouped again though before we could really talk about what had happened I started to feel faint and someone called me an ambulance. I ended up getting 6 stiches and a lovely scar. When we did get a chance to talk about it none of us could really come up with anything like a rational explanation for what had happened. \n\nAnyway I hope you can understand now why I would be so confused that even years later one of us would want to go hang out at that park at night. Now here is the actual reason I’m making this post. I met up with the guys again the next week and I brought up what had happened that night and none of them knew what I was talking about. I thought they were joking but they were dead serious. They kept telling me they hadn’t even heard any stories about the forest or the park. They remember other night adventures we had like exploring the local graveyard or the abandoned house and even remember us going up to the forest in the day but they all say we never actually went up there at night. I brought up that I got my scar on that night but all of them said they weren’t with me when I got the scar.\n\nI just don’t know what to think I feel like I’m going or have gone crazy but I even went through some old stuff from around the time and found one of my old note books where I wrote down what had happened and I have notes from a few days later about what they guys had said about what they saw/experienced that night.\n\nIf anyone has any experiences like this or any idea what I should do now I would greatly appreciate some advice.\n\n\n**tl;dr** - I had an intense paranormal experience with some friends when we were young, and now no one but me seems to have any memory of it.",

This involves me taking a single card and bringing it above my head in an exaggerated act. However, this time I practiced it, it dropped it out of my hand and down the back of the couch. I can't see behind it well, and even with a torch I couldn't tell if it was there.\n\nSo, tonight, now that I have the time and energy (I was ill), I moved the entirety of the couch, which is quite big, so I could crawl under and find my card. Yet after about 30 minutes of searching, I couldn't find it. I even checked and double checked in between the pillows and parts of the couch, without finding it.\nIt's gone. Seriously, there's no getting it back. I also cleaned behind and under the couch too, so there's no way I could've missed it.\n\nSo I've just come to the conclusion that I accidentally performed real magic for an invisible audience. That, or it was most certainly a glitch.",

After watching all of them, I was always talking about GOT and how excited I was for the next season. \n\n\nI thought that there were more than 10 episodes for seasons 1-5 and that they were reducing the number of episodes to 10 for season 6. \n\n\nBefore season 6 started I remember bringing up the fact that we ONLY have 10 episodes this season. This was a topic of conversation from time to time when I would talk to my friends that watches the show.\n\n\nI also constantly listen to the radio at work and I swear I remember even the radio hosts talking about how there were fewer episodes this season.\n\n\nI would always complain when the subject came up that we only get 10 episodes this season and we have 13 over the next TWO seasons coming up.\n\n\nFast forward to today, I was at the break room having lunch and started talking to a coworker that's a GOT fan. I remember bringing up that we only get 13 episodes over the next two seasons and that it was only 10 this season. He then tells me that it has always been 10 episodes. I get confused at his nonchalant answer. He says GOT has 10 episodes as if he's saying that the sky is blue. I disagree with him, knowing for sure that I'm right. He says he could be mistaken but he sounded confident enough. \n\n\nWhen I looked it up though, sure enough there are only 10 EPISODES per seasons for 1-6. EVERY SEASON has ONLY 10 episodes.\n\n\nI am in a state of awe, but I SWEAR I experienced watching 12 or 14 episodes. And I remember having conversations in the past with multiple people who AGREED and confirmed the episode amount.\n\n\nThoughts??",

Now I actually live in one.\n\nSo I've traveled quite a bit and have toured a great many Victorian homes over the past 18 years.   \n\nEvent:  My husband and I were married 7 years ago in a Victorian Mansion.  I had toured that mansion with him 4 times before we were married, but after we were married we hadn't returned since.  2 weeks ago I wanted to go back and take the tour for nostalgia purposes.  During the tour I expected to see a tour of the Kitchen because I specifically remember a Victorian Cast Iron stove/oven specially made for the lady of the house who was in a wheel chair towards the end of her life and needed it shorter to the ground.  I remember being told this on the tour - of what I thought was the mansion I got married in.  But too my surprise the kitchen is NOT on the tour Never was, and my husband doesn't remember it.\n\nWeird aspect of this memory is I can visualize the kitchen.  I remember closely leaning in to inspect the stove because it was so unique.  I remember physically being there. But now no stove EVER existed.  And the rich woman was never wheel chair bound.  And their Ancestry changed from once being Irish to now PRUSSIAN which makes no sense what so ever since the Mansion is decorated with CELTIC motifs everywhere.  Even the Mansion has green men and Celtic gargoyles carved in stone on it.\n\nSummary:  I have experienced hundreds of Mandela Effects now so it's not a surprise.  The fact that my memory claims that the Mansion never had a kitchen in his memory is of no surprise.  What  is messing my mind up is - WHERE did this memory come from.  Because now that I've thought about this for a while I don't believe it ever existed on that tour, even though I expected to see it 2 weeks ago.  MIND BLOWN!\n\n- I now KNOW that this stove and kitchen never existed in that Mansion, even with the ME's.  Even though I fully expected it to be there.\n\n- This memory is from within the past 10 years and I've only visited 5 other Victorian houses since and double checked them in my photos album.\n\n- This memory is so disconnected from anything else I don't remember anything else about the house with the small Victorian oven.\n\n- I have a very high IQ and Photographic memory.\n\n- I now believe this memory happened to me from a different dimension ",

We used to mess around with spells, ghost hunting, future sight etc.\n\nI also have always suffered from sleep paralysis and night terrors, which have gotten less severe with age. Some were vivid, like demons on my chest threatening me, hearing and seeing ghosts and shadow figures in my home, my brother and I had a violent incident with a shadowfigure once. But that's a different story for another time. But back to the task at hand.\n\nOne day I was hanging out with her (my female friend) and a male friend of hers, we played around like kids do. She taught me this silly game that was basically a pillow fight where one person hides behind a bed and the rest toss pillows at them. I don't remember it too well. Well, what happened after was the weird part. When it was my turn to be behind the bed, I have distinct memories of there being a type of cubby or crawlspace that I hid in for more cover.\n\nNone of that is really important, just some background information. The strange part happened the next day at school. I was talking to the female friend, and she completely denied that I had been there, or her other friend. She told me that there had been two others with her and she was beyond confused that I knew about their game. I found this really odd, and began to imagine I hopped dimensions.\n\nLater in life, when I was in 7th or 8th grade (we had a seperate middle school in our town), another incident happened involving the same girl. I was looking in her direction during lunch, and I noticed she was wearing a blue shirt with white horizontal stripes. Next moment, after blinking, her shirt was pink, with the same pattern. I confronted her afterwards, and she claimed she had always been wearing a pink shirt. I noticed that things in my life were a little different after...\n\nWhat do you all think happened?",

Anecdotal evidence is usually crap, and so I've always tried applying that skepticism to my own experience.\n\nBut, here's the thing, I really can't explain away this certain childhood event.\n\nSo it's around 2002-2003, in the midst of a terrible heat wave living outside Glendale, Arizona, in one of those low cost suburbs that the great desert of the American Southwest is known for. Now being around 10 years old during those times meant a lot of playing outside to not burden the parents with my presence, and that meant getting into all sorts of mischief in the neighborhood with kids from around the block.\n\nWe were all inventive little shits, and would fill our days and nights fighting (fight club style), pranking neighbors, racing on bicycles, and terrorizing each other through an assortment of ridiculous amalgamations of standard childhood games (Charlie Horse Tag, anyone?)\n\nOne day, in particular, me, my brother Derek, and our friend Archie (names changed for anonymity) were all playing hide-and-go-seek on the block, as normal, yelling at each other and overall just trying to weather the day until bedtime.\n\nWhen all of us turned and looked to the top of a house at the end of the street and saw this absolutely MASSIVE bird - easily as large as the house it was perched upon. It was light and dark brown, with tan streaks in its feathers; had an elongated neck like that of a vulture, but the head of a kinda turkey/hawk mix (beak and forehead of a hawk, with that weird whatchamacallit testicle looking thing hanging under its beak like Turkey). \n\nNow, we were all running around when Derek kind of screeched, with me and Archie turning around just as it seemingly landed (its wings were moving in a downward motion as if it was cushioning a fall). It lifted its wings temporarily AND THEN FUCKING DISAPPEARED. Almost in an instant.\n\nWe stood there in shock for a solid minute contemplating what the hell we just saw.\n\nNow I am all for thinking it was a hallucination brought on by heat exhaustion - but, then, how did all three of us see the same thing?\n\nTo this day it is an unexplainable event that screws with me.\n\nAnd that's 'muh story.",

But recently, I've experienced one of my own. \n\nFirst, some background. I live alone, so there is no chance of somebody messing with me. I am android all the way, so I have no apple chargers (like the ones that fit iPhones and iPads). I haven't had any guests over that have apple products in the past 3 weeks. I have just a normal black mini usb cable plugged into the wall next to my bed, tied to my bedpost so it doesn't fall.\n\nNow for the glitch. I was minding my own business, like normal, get home, eat, shower, and netflix &amp; reddit. Then, as I'm about to go to sleep, I reach over to plug my phone in because it's dead. I grab the cable and try to plug my phone in but for some reason it won't go. So I flip the cable, jiggle it around, and keep trying to plug in my phone. I get frustrated and turn on a light to see whats going on and so I can resurrect my poor phone, when I see something that amazed me. In my hand, what should have been a normal black usb cable, was a black off-brand apple cord. The funny thing is, my usb cable was just laying on the ground next to my bed. But keep in mind that nobody thats been over to my house (that I know of) has an apple product. So... yeah. I somehow ended up with an apple cord even thought I don't have any logical explanation of how. But the good thing that came from this was I got an apple cord for free. No use for it though.\n\nTL;DR: black usb cable turned into a black off-brand apple cable",

        "text": "Hey guys first time posting on here. So this happened Christmas Eve of 2014. At the time I was living in a house with 6 guys in college. It was Christmas Eve, so this house was empty besides one other roommate because we both had to work. \n\nI had to get up early to work retail on Christmas Eve, so I went to bed early. Before doing so I told my roommate to lock everything up. He said he would so I said ok and went off to bed. In the morning after I got dressed and went downstairs to head out, I noticed the front door was open but figured my roommate had gone out momentarily and left it open. I thought it was odd, but didn't set off any alarms. Once I got to work I got some frantic texts from him asking if I left the door open. I told him no and he informed me that we had been robbed. I asked him if my watch that I left on the coffee table, or my laptop which I left next to the couch were still there. (The laptop was placed on its side against the wall in a space about four inches wide and about two feet deep) He informed me that neither were there nor was his macbook or our xbox controllers. He said the backdoor was open and there was an xbox controller and some other stuff on the ground on our backyard. He called the police and had them check the house while I was at work and both of them checked the place where I told him my laptop was. It was in a place where you'd see it and it was there or it wasn't. It was a very small and easy to see spot next to some outlets. They did not find it and neither did I when I got home. I looked all around the living room for the laptop in case I left it somewhere else, but I was confident that I had left it there and that it was gone. It wasn't really a big deal as it wasn't an expensive laptop and had a cracked screen. Fast forward a month later and I was walking past the corner where I had left my laptop and it was there on its side against the wall just as I had left it. Nothing else from that robbery ever reappeared. I've gone over this many times over the past year and a half and haven't come up with any reasonable explanations. Let me know what you guys think",

        "text": "Not 100% if this is meant for this sub or not but\n\nMost nights i know that im dreaming and can wake myself up, i guess its lucid dreaming. Last night though, i went to sleep around 12 with the intention of waking up for work at 5:15 am. My bed was really messy and I ended up falling asleep around 12:30. I had a dream that felt extremely real, thinking back about it more real than most dreams. In the dream i was basically about to go to sleep and I went upstairs. However there were some small but not so huge differences that i was able to tell i was in a dream. I went to my room and saw my sister sleeping on my bed, normally i wouldve asked her to wake up but i guess my bed was dirty (even before i went to sleep my bed sheets were a bit messy in real life) and I decided to go sleep on her bed in the dream. So I get to her room and notice how my brother is charging his phone in her room over the night, now sometimes he leaves his phone charging around the house but never overnight but in the dream I didnt think much of it. I noticed that on his phone screen he was getting notifications from my contacts, people who he never talked to in his life. so i was confused about that in the dream but decided to just go to sleep on my sisters bed. So I laid down and I guess I fell asleep, but the next thing I know i wake up in my own bed in my own room. Because i remember my dreams well I was very confused because even in the dark I knew this wasnt my sisters bed, where i assumed i was. I had woken up because of my alarm, which right when i woke up i thought was my sisters ipad alarm (she sometimes sets it early in the morning for fajr prayer). Then i noticed that i wasnt on my sisters bed, where i assumed i was because i just fell asleep there right? So initially I was really confused but after a few seconds I guess i realized that it was a dream but definitely one of the trippiest moments of my life. I immediately think back to inception and tbh i didnt even feel like i just woke up, if felt more like i switched dimensions i dont know how to describe it. Because i literally felt like i was in my sisters bed one second and in my own bed the next, i woke up thinking i got no sleep, its kind of hard to explain.",

        "text": "I went to the same summer camp from when I was around 5 up until I was 12 and had a group of friends who also came back every year. There was a pair of twin girls that both had a deformed left arm. The arms were much shorter and had two fingers at the end rather than five. No one ever bullied the twins for being different, but I hags distinct memories of BOTH of their arms and various situations in which they both couldn't do something because of this. I can vividly remember both girls staying out of the deep end of the pool when we were younger and not doing the monkey bar races etc.\nSo I come back to camp at around age 10 for the summer and only one of the girls has a deformed arm. I was absolutely baffled and couldn't believe what I was seeing, and I was so convinced that they both had deformed left arms that I even asked another friend privately if the one twin had gotten surgery or something to fix it. She looked at me and said something like \"what are you talking about only -other twin- has the arm\". \n\nTo this day I have no idea how I was convinced for YEARS that they both had the same condition when apparently only one did. I EVEN REMEMBER THEM JOKINGLY HIGH FIVING WITH THEIR DEFORMED HANDS AND EVERYONE LOVED IT.\n\nIt disturbed me so much that I actually had trouble being around them without internally freaking out. Still don't know how the fuck this happened ten years later.",

        "text": "I'm a musician. I play 3-4 gigs a week all over the north east with an acoustic duo. For my guitar, I have what's called a feedback suppressor. It's a round rubber piece that fits in the sound hole of my guitar, to prevent feedback from the stage monitors. 6 months ago, we played a set at this really huge/locally famous BBQ joint in New York. We had a full band, the show was awesome, tons of people, the \"dream gig\" kinda night. During sound check, my guitar was having problems so I took out the suppressor from my guitar and put it in my guitar case. Guitar was still giving problems, so I packed that one away and used my back up guitar. Flash forward to later, I had packed up after the gig, and when I went home and unpacked, I noticed my feedback suppressor was missing from my guitar case. I couldn't find it anywhere. Must've been lost in the shuffle. I looked all over. My gig bags, crates, back at the venue, my car and everything. And mind you, I've cleaned my car many times the past few months and would've seen it at some point. Alas, it never showed up. So, I went and bought another one after giving up hope.\n\n     Flash forward six months, I'm playing at the same venue tonight. And mind you my suppressor replacement has never left my guitar ever since I bought it a few months ago. The gig went well, and as we pulled up into the house after the show, I went to unpack my car. I picked up my guitar, and laying underneath it was none other than...the feedback suppressor. That doesn't make sense...I checked my guitar, and sure enough the new one was still in it. And there was the old one sitting in the back seat of my car as if it had been there all along, but it couldn't have been because I clean my car every couple weeks and would've seen it laying in my back seat. I'm kind of freaked out and confused. It's either I'm living in the Twilight Zone, or I just experienced a Glitch in the Matrix...",
