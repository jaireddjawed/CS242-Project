        "text": "So about a year ago I was going through sorority recruitment at my university. I wanted to join because I just always had a hard time connecting with people and I wanted a group of girls on campus like me. So I’m usually pretty quiet and shy around people I don’t know. \n\nWhile standing in line before going into the different houses we stood in alphabetic order. The girl in front of me I shall refer to as Claire. Claire was racist, homophobic, and had something nasty to say about anything and everything. \n\nEvery time we would leave a house she would say something bad such as “that girl I talked to was so freaking ugly I couldn’t concentrate” or “I had to talk to a n****”. Just really horrible things which really bugged me. \n\nShe made remarks about my looks constantly and acted like she was better than everyone else. So I was invited to join a sorority but she wasn’t.\n\nSo recently during recruitment I saw her going through again. I explained to the president of my sorority of how nasty Claire was the previous year during recruitment and my president told all the other houses. None of the sororities want her now. It was her own fault. \n\nEdit: I go to school in the south",

As I am waiting in line, this little kid and his rude ass mother were all in my personal space.\n\nSo much so that the kid stuck his damn lollipop to my dress pants. (I work in an office so this isn't good either way) I tell the parent what happened and she just looked at my now sticky, stained pants and said for me to not stand so close to her or her child.\n\nLike what bitch? There's someone in front of me. I can't go anywhere else and if I do then I will be in HIS personal space. Clearly, I didn't have the energy or time to argue with this Whale and her rotten kid so I go pay for my gas and as I turn around to walkout, her kid get's my pants again with the bullshit candy.\n\nI am not in a place where I can think of a great way to get my petty revenge so I had to think fast and the only thing I could think of at the time was to fart on this kid. So that's what I did. Is nose being level with my asshole, I made sure I invaded his personal space and deliberately put my ass crack on his face and let one loose. It was audible. Everyone heard it. Everyone could get a whiff and I didn't give a shit. (I almost gave a shit, right on his face).\n\nOnce I was done, the mother looked horrified while everyone else was laughing. \"Why the fuck would you do that to my son?. haven't you heard of personal space?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't and neither has your shitty kid.\" *friiip* I let another one off as I crop dusted their ass on the way out.\n\nFuck you fatty.\n\n",

        "text": "So this happened when I was younger, maybe 11 or 12. My family lived in a rented two storey house with the landlord living on the second floor.\n\n\nThe landlord had a kid a year younger than me. Now this brat was one of those really annoying kids with a massive inferiority complex, so they have to make everything worse around them and in general do a lot of retarded shit.\n\n\nThis kid did everything, called me dumb names (on no provocation), cheat on whatever games we played (badminton, cricket, etc), stole my toys every annoying trick in the book. But he was also the only kid my age I knew and played with so oh well, I tolerate him while also hating him.\n\n\nI tolerated him until he developed a new way of annoying me, ding-dong-ditching. I was always the one at home to attend to a doorbell (because I was so quick), so he'd ring the doorbell and then run away while looking back and laughing at me. He did this only once a day, when he was going out to play, but everyday, religiously.\n\n\nFor some reason, I was really annoyed by this, I complained to his mother like any normal (would a normal kid do this? I'm not sure) kid would, but to no avail. One day, my quick temper decided, enough was enough.\n\n\nI waited by the unlatched open door, just as I heard him approaching, his footsteps on the stairs. Just as the little runt rang the bell, I quickly opened the door before he could run away, and grabbed him by his collar. Then I proceeded to punch him twice in the face and once in the chest. That was enough to send him away sobbing, and never pulling the dumb pranks again\n\n\nI was never a bully type of kid, I mostly kept to myself but that confrontation gave me immense joy because every day I'd see the fuck running away after ringing the bell, while mocking me.",

        "text": "My cousin was born with a congenital disease that left her with a diminished mental capacity but she never let that slow her down, she was my hero. I remember one time when she was in High School, the school was making the special education students clean the school along with the janitorial staff. My cousin demanded that she get paid for her time cleaning as well and when the school refused she had her mom file a complaint with the department of labor. She never let anyone take advantage of her, I wish I had half the spine she did. \n\nMy cousin's bio dad couldn't handle a kid with a disability so he dipped out pretty early and remarried the ultimate \"Christian\" hypocrite. She already had two kids and didn't really want to deal with my cousin so they pretended like my cousin didn't exist for like 5 years. Well someone in the curch found out that my ExUncle had a child with special needs that he never saw and the gossip started flying. So when my cousin was about 7 or 8 he showed back up and demanded to have access to my cousin. He and his wife started dragging my cousin to large church events almost as some kind of prop to prove how \"Godly\" they were. \n\nSo one of the lady's kids birthday was coming up and they were having a pool party. Everyone from the church was going to be there and my cousin HAD to be there also. Even though because of her condition she couldn't swim and thus would just be sitting around watching all the other kids have fun. My cousin had alot of phisical aliments due to her condition and had to be on a very specialized diet. She really couldn't have salt, sugar, or anything processed. Well because my ExUncle and his wife were assholes they didn't have anything my cousin could eat. NOTHING. So my cousin just had to sit there with nothing to do and nothing to eat, pissed off that she was forced to be there. She waited till everyone was distracted with the pinata (she wasn't allowed to partake in that either), and then snuck up to the food and SOAKED IT ALL WITH A SUPER SOAKER she even got the cake!!! My ExUncle and his wife called my Aunt and demanded that she come and pick up my cousin early. They then started screaming at my cousin, much to the dismay of their fellow church patrons. Everyone ended up leaving early and their reputation was pretty tarnished after that. ExUncle and his wife decided to go to Disney Land as a make up birthday and of course my cousin wasn't invited. \n\nMy cousin died a year ago and I miss her so much. She was the biggest example on how not to take shit from anyone and the Queen of Petty revenge. All hail the Queen! \n\n\n**I just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words! My cousin would have been absolutely thrilled to see all these comments in support of her! She might be gone but she'll never be forgotten. Thanks for helping me keep her memory alive!**",

So I took over the table determined to kill them with kindness. I oblige every last request with a smile although I felt like they were trying to antagonize me at times. It didn't bother me when one sent her chocolate chip cookie back because it had fudge on it and she forgot to tell me no fudge. She claimed to be allergic to chocolate...not the chocolate in the chocolate chips, just to the fudge. Ok. She gets a new cookie. I didn't let it bother me when they asked for boxes, 7 different ramekins of condiments to go, lettuce and pico to go. I didn't let it bother me when they left $2 on a $50 check (after a student discount). So, when I go to clean the table I realize that one has left her to go box. Uh-oh. I smile. Since they had requested so much extra stuff to go, I knew they'd come back for it. I took it directly to the trash. About 5 minutes later one of them calls, asking if the box was still there. I had the delight of answering the phone and saying no, it had been thrown away (without an apology). Apparently the girl who called was not the owner of the food because as she relayed the message there was unintelligible yelling in the background. I laughed, said \"Have a great night!\" And hung up. Felt great.",

Stupid assholes with an attitude who don’t even know what they’re talking about. \n\n\nThey mentioned they were on a budget and trying to spend as little as possible. At the end when we finally figured out what car they had and what they needed, I noticed there were two of one of the parts they needed, they were identical in function, just different brands. One was $50, the other was $35. Guess which part I sold em? Not that great of a story, but felt good for me. ",

        "text": "   About 4 months ago we let my Fiances best friend (we will call her R) and her 2 year old move in with us and stay for free until she got on her feet. The reason for moving in was that she claimed the father of her child (J) was abusive and a drug addict.  Because of this, her family told her as long as she was with him they wouldnt have anything to do with her but if she left they would let her come home.\n\n   The first 3 months went smooth and I even helped her get a job while my fiance helped her file for child support and got her the paper work to enroll in school to become a CNA. On the fourth month (1 week ago) we find out that she told my future mother in law some unsettling things about my fiance (primarily that she was cold and rude to her) which couldnt be further from the truth. We had a sit down talk with her and she immediately held the child tight and started crying saying shes had to lie so much over the past 8 years that its become a habit. We felt bad and forgave her.\n\nWe woke up the next morning and J was picking her up and taking her back to his house 2 hours away. Shes a big girl so no big deal, she can make her own decisions. I would have left it at that honestly but her own mother and my fiances mother called to tell us what she said. Apparently I was an alcoholic who didnt work ( I wfh full time as a business analyst and rarely if ever drink) and my fiance shouldnt have children because shes neglectful and cold ( we had 2 miscarriages so this hit her particularly).\n\nNeedless to say, revenge was necessary. Apparently she told her family she was done with J. We sent screen shots of texts proving she was with him every weekend. We provided proof to her mother and my MIL that everything she said was a lie. So now her family is done with her and my MIL is done with her but that still wasnt enough. When her and J came to pick up her stuff...we made sure to let him know about the men she was with while seeing him every weekend, proved all her lies were false and showed him texts of her accusing him of drugs and abuse. \n\nAfter all that, my fiance received a text from R saying J kicked her out again and is keeping the child until custody. Also we agreed to testify for the father in the custody battle. \n\nUnderstandably this seems a bit harsh...but when I take you in, help you in every way possible and ask nothing in return and you tell horrifying lies about me and my fiance...you deserve everything that comes your way.\n",

I broke when he took a picture of me brother and captiond it with\"look at this retard\" (my brother was not a retard) with out my brothers consent. The police almost got involved. The next year he started \"bulling\" me. It was technically bulling but i didn't care and bottled it up. when we found out that we were going on a amazing school tour we all were ecstatic. Then my \"bully\" did someting stupid and the teacher said\"do much more of this and you willnot go on the tour. This is when he whent from \"bullying\" to proper bullying. So i told the teacher everything he did to me knowing that he would not go on the school tour. The teachers empty thret of not going became real and he got banned from the school tour. Now this school tour was one of the best school tour in the history of school tours. The cherry on top of this story wastge last year(my year) goes on an class trip. We went to his favourite place and he wasn't allowed to come. ",

        "text": "Years ago I was a young 24 year old nurse working in a large hospital. This creepy intern liked to come up and get handsy with young nurses. I hope you read this you asshole. He’d suddenly start massaging young nurses. He start rubbing their neck, touching their arms or shoulders while they were at the nurses station.  \n\nThe nurse would stiffen up, obviously uncomfortable and try to extricate themselves politely. He thought he was so smooth and likely thought this was a way to get a date. \n\nI was seated, in the middle of the day, in a huge busy open nurses station with 20 or so doctors and nurses and ancillary engaged in various activities all around. I’d barely managed to avoid his physical attention in the past but witnessed it daily. I didn’t see him creep up behind me and suddenly I felt him massaging my neck and shoulders. I didn’t know what to do. So I screamed at the top of my lungs:\n\n“Get your hands off me, I’m a married woman!”\n\nNow everyone in earshot was staring at us. He immediately lifted both his hands off me about 6 inches into the air and froze.\nI got up and walked away. I heard him exclaim, “I didn’t know, I didn’t know!” He never bothered me again. I spotted him at a Christmas party a couple weeks later while I was with my 6’2” husband. He saw me and practically ran in another direction. ",

We used to draw in small crowd that watched us play and enjoyed the entertainment while they waited for their parents as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was one kid that always came to watch us, he was a year or two younger than us, he was quite large for his age, bigger than me at the time since i was quite short and thin for my age.\n\nSo one day it was just him watching us as usual and i just beat my friend and we decided to pack up do something else, the kid said to me he loved watching us play and asked could he see my deck, I said of course since I was nice guy, he looked at for a good few minutes and me and my friend were talking after 2 or so mins he gave me the deck back and said thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI checked the deck to make sure everything was there, and to my surprise i saw a few cards missing, i called him back and confronted him and he said he didn't have any cards on him.\n\nI said ok and let him go, then followed him from a good distance and saw him put the cards in his backpack with his own cards and walked away.\n\nI waited a good few minutes till he was gone and then went to his backpack took my cards back and his entire yu gi oh deck that he had (turns out he also liked to play, who would have thought). I then proceeded to hide his backpack in a tree and right after my mom arrived to pick me up.\n\nThe perfect heist.\n\nHe never confronted me about it and still watched us play for some reason. I even used the cards i got from his deck right in front of his face to get a reaction but he never said a word.",

I try not to be too much of a white knight about stuff like that, so I (angrily) watched it play out before deciding there was a justification to interfere. She said \"no, no\" when he repeatedly asked for her phone number, and repeatedly asked him to stop pestering her, so I got up and went over to them.\n\nI looked for an uncomfortably long time at the guy's chest; \"that's a nice shirt.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Hey man, just saying, that's a nice shirt, I bet the ladies love it.\"\n\nThe girl started laughing, so I felt at least a little validation for my bizarre behavior. I started making kissing noises at him. \"I like how you unbutton that collar.\" I was doing the \"Prison Mike\" \"don't drop the soap\" thing, if that reference makes sense. I kept doing it until he got really uncomfortable and moved to one of the many empty seats.\n\nI thought to myself \"what the fuck did I just do?\" I didn't really see how the girl reacted; I didn't look at her again, because what kind of a weird ass person would strike up a conversation with her after that? I just looked blankly ahead and got off the bus a couple of stops later. ",

The problem was that we would get a message to gist of \"I'm a stranger with your landlords permission to bring a stranger to your house in 3 hours.\" As any normal human, I'd imagine, would agree there are many reasons that might not be ideal or at least desired. So we asked them to give us more notice. Their response was \"we only have to give you one hour, so we're coming, but as a courtesy we will notify you 24 hours in advance in the future.\" Weirdly this did not make me or my girlfriend any happier about the situation, so she called a friend who is a real estate lawyer! Turns out you can't show my apartment with an hour's notice,  or otherwise, unlesse trying to rent my apartment. So we replied that they may not come, but they can call our lawyer if they want, and they didn't even reply. Right now they're downstairs looking at the unfinished apartment like good little elves. \n\nEdit: I'm sorry for not being naked at home when they arrived internet, I really am. ",

He does everything every normal teenager in the middle of puberty does, and most of that is having a pleasure annoying others. He especially enjoys being stubborn.\n\nToday we went for a walk with my dog - me, mum and him. We drove for half an hour to a nice forest where there are a lot of trails perfect for walking a dog. When we finished an hour long walk, I was very tired since I drove there and just wanted to chill on the passanger's sit, put on some music and look outside. However, when I told this to mum and him, he said he already wanted to sit in the passengers sit, and that he will not let me do it. He smirked and in that moment it was clear to me that he just wanted to annoy me.\n\nSo, when we got to the car, he jumped in front of me the second my mum unlocked the car. He shoved me away and smiled victoriously, then said: \"Stubbornness always wins.\"\n\nWhat he didn't know was that I was in a very petty mood. The moment we sat in the car I sat behind him (mum was driving) and prepared my evil plan: stretched my legs all the way, and pressed them in the back of his sit.\n\nHe readjusted himself a few times, tried to move the chair and did not know what was wrong. He pushed back, looked around and - saw me. He realised what was going on and looked at me like he was ready to kill me. But all I had to say was.. \"Stubbornness always wins.\" He just turned away.\n\nHe kept readjusting for whole 30 minutes. Back sit felt so comfortable compared to this. \n\nTL;DR: Bro took a sit in the car I wanted just to annoy me, I made sure it was the most uncomfortable sit in the universe.",

They got a few lengths ahead of me, then stopped, on the sidewalk, to have a little chat.

I knew what I had to do. \n\nAs we pulled up to the station, and the doors slid open, I looked at him in the face for the first time. He kinda indirectly looked me, his eyes not meeting mine but his face turned toward me. \n\nAnd I sneezed a huge sneeze straight in his face. I really played it up too.

TL;DR at the end.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place for this story but it's a sort of continuation of a previous post I made on here and felt you guys deserved to stay in the loop. \n\nMy last post was about getting revenge on BT (Blonde Twat) that got me fired from a bouncing gig at a local bar. Well, this time around the owner of the bar tried to cause some problems for me.\n\nI recently got offered a job at a call center that pays comparatively well to most jobs locally but has a exhaustive background check due to the nature of information I will be dealing with. I got an email today from the company doing the background check telling me that one of my previous employers would not verify my employment. I check and, lo and behold, it's the bar. I got in contact with the owner and politely asked if he would be willing to send me a letterhead verifying my employment. All I got in response was \"Sorry can't help you with that\". When I asked why, he said because I was a bouncer and paid in cash, I was not an employee.\n\nTechnically that was the truth but he forgot the first three months i worked for him, I was a barback and paid by check. \n\nSo I apologize for the confusion and then asked him if I could instead get my W-2's for my first three months instead, since I was an employee on the payroll. Now, I know he didn't have my W-2's when I asked this and sure enough, I get emailed a letterhead with the full time that I worked there, nothing else said.\n\nTL;DR Former boss tried to screw up my chances at a new job. Reminded him the IRS could screw up his shit worse than he could screw up mine.",

As a kid I just thought it was a cool holo card and didn't know it was worth some money at that time. Maybe a few days later I went to a local tournament with two friends, and these two older kids come up to me because they saw my magic cylinder, they then ask to see my deck and both of them starting handing each other the cards to look at back and forth, I get my deck back and realize maybe after the tournament my card was missing. I was really distraught but was afraid to approach the two older kids, I then see them sitting outside of the Toys R Us (Toy store beside the card shop) as a little kid beside them goes in. Me and my friends go in to approach the little kid,who turns out to be one of the older kid's little brother and made friends with him, I then ask to see his deck and proceed to take all his holo cards, then ask him if he wants to play hide and seek and told him to count to 50, as me and my friends walk out of the store after. Looking back at that I feel bad for what I did to the kid but I wanted to get back at his asshole brother somehow.",

During some down time, it was not uncommon for coworkers and me to hang out at the local bar next to the hotel.  The chilapplebee’s had a vigorous after work business and on one evening, a cute woman in her business suit sat next to me.   Now, I’m from the Deep South and chivalry mandated polite conversation and such.  I even gave her my barstool where I was perched as a gesture of kindness.  During our conversations, we compared pagers (they were a thing back then) and bemoaned the hassle of being on call.  One thing she said was that she had worked for Shell Oil in her career.  I laughed and told her that you could send 71077345 to a pager and it would spell “Shell Oil” on the display.  Big laughs all around. \n\nAs the evening progressed, she suggested we leave chilapplebee’s and go to a better place.  I was game.\n\nAs she was local, she drove.  The next place we went was a country/western bar with a live band.  She assumed that because I was from the Deep South, I “loved” country music.   Note:  even though I was from the Deep South, I loathed country music.  And I thought I was polite when I told her it wasn’t my favorite genre.\n\nI obviously offended her, because she left for the bathroom and stranded me there.  Before we had left, she had said she’d take me back to chilapplebee’s.  So I was stuck. It was late, miles from the hotel, so I called a taxi and ponied out the bucks to get me back there.\n\nI could have dropped it, but I didn’t.  For the next few weeks, whenever I got access to a pay phone (day, night, early morning), I called her pager and entered 71077345 because it spelled SHELLOIL.  \n\nUnfortunately for her, I worked from 9 pm to 9 am.  And there were phones where I  called her pager at midnight, 1 am, 2 am, 3 am, and all hours of the day.\n\nEnjoy waking up to your pager going off all night/morning long! \n\ntldr:  hottie strands me in a bar, I call her pager at ungodly hours entering 71077345 because it spells SHELLOIL on a pager display and she had worked there during her career.  \n",

I ask her respectfully can I retake the picture since I can’t even recognize my own face but she still outright refused despite an additional protest.\nLater when coming back on base, I get fully checked at the gate and sitting in a sterile area for a bit, a high ranking SF/MP (Security Forces/Military Police) asked where I got it, I told him here (at this base) give him a description of the lady and of what happened. He had me follow him to the ID card/DEERS office and asks them give me a new one. The lady who took the original picture is super salty and is looming behind her nice coworker that was taking my picture (with the SF guy out of her view, but right next to me) said “Why didn’t you go to an Army base if you NEED a better picture?!.”  The other ID card lady does an eye roll in annoyance of her coworker; then the SF Hero chimes in with “THAT ID CARD IS UNACCEPTABLE ANYWHERE in the Department Of Defense. And Ma’am I NEED TO SEE YOUR SUPERVISOR RIGHT NOW.” I also say “I’m sure the closest Army base is Fort Irwin, California.” (Nellis AFB is in Las Vegas, Nevada) While I’m finishing up with the new ID card, I thank the new lady for my ID and her courtesy.

It was a huge indoor event as Saskatchewan in January is Sometimes a bit nippy out. It was about -30 celsius (having a shower then going outside to let my hair freeze and then shake the ice out cold).\n\nAfter the last event on the Sunday we have a big party at the hotel. The party is great but at some point we decide to head across the road to a country bar to continue the fun and do some bull riding on the mechanical bull they have.\n\nSo about thirty guys show up to drink and ride said bull. Our team Captain spearheaded this little expedition and asked them to fire up the bull. \n\n“Sorry the guy who runs the bull is not here.”\n\nCaptain “Can you get him in?”\n\n“Nope”\n\nCaptain “Dude, I know Sundays are usually slow but you just got thirty guys in here ready to spend, you might want to try and get him in.”\n\n“Nah”\n\nCaptain “Okay boys guess they don’t need the business here let’s head back. There is still half a tub full of beer back at the room.”\n\nWe are a little disappointed as we head back to the hotel. Everyone except our captain who was giggling like a school kid. I asked him why and between his giggles he tells me he turned off their heat as he went out. That got us all laughing mostly at his pettiness and also wondering how long at -30 it would take to notice it.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: so many comments about us being jerks. So,yes we were.\n\nEquation:  drinking + 20year olds + mob mentality = petty + revenge\n\nAnd if you stop and think 30 drunk guys did not start a yelling argument or worse off a fight over this. For the most part we just left a little dejected. One of the 30 drunk guys reached over and turned down a thermostat because he thought it was funny. And it was kinda funny at the time. Guess you had to be there.\n",

Due to a mix up in a taxi, I lost my wallet and had to rely solely on the provided meals (at least until I could set something up on my phone for paying). For the average person this would be fine, but I have several food allergies and am always nervous around self-serve areas and buffets because you never know what the people before you have touched. \n\nI ended up missing lunch because I was preparing for a presentation and presented at a session that was going on during the lunch period. I was able to snag a bag of chips but I was still pretty hungry. It was nearing the end of the day and there were only two short sessions left. I arrived about 20 minutes early and saw the event staff setting up the food table. They were putting out snacks such as chex mix, popcorn, pretzels, and candy. I took a look at some of the bags and saw that I could only have a few things. I was craving something sweet so I wanted to get some M&amp;Ms. Meanwhile, this lady walks in and I just get a pretentious vibe from her. You know the type - high heels clicking, super long painted nails, talking loudly on the phone, carrying an expensive purse. She cuts right in front of me as I grab a bowl. Each dish of snacks has a serving spoon. I watch as she takes the spoon from the peanut M&amp;Ms and pours some in her bowl. Next, without even putting down the spoon she sticks it right into the regular M&amp;Ms. Now I'm not allergic to peanuts but I'm allergic to most other nuts. I can eat regular M&amp;Ms but peanut M&amp;Ms may contain other nuts so she cross contaminated the regular bowl.\n\nI was pretty annoyed that I couldn't have my sweets so I took some popcorn and sat down. The lady leaves buts comes back right as the session is starting. The room could only hold maybe 40 people but she sits right next to me up in the front. I realized I was also sitting near the presenters, so each left their seat as they went up to speak and stayed up there during the panel. About 10 minutes in she left for a phone call. I got up to get a glass of water as she was gone. As I'm sitting back down, I I noticed one lone M&amp;M sitting in the chair she set her snacks on (she must've thrown the bowl out on her way out). I quickly decided to steal her seat, so I sit down and push her purse over with my foot. She comes back and quickly sits down next to me. I smiled, knowing that the M&amp;M was slowly melting underneath her.\n\nIt wasn't until half an hour or so later when I realized that she was a presenter in the next session and everyone could see the little brown spot on her butt if they really looked closely. I do feel a little guilty about that. ",

She once called me “retarded” because I counted money in a different way than her. She made each staff member cry in the bathroom at least once a week. She was horrible. \n\nAnyway, M was SUPER particular about her pens. She could ONLY use a black G2 ink gel pens. She would go absolutely nuts if she couldn’t find her pen. She always put a little post it note with her name on the pen so everyone would know it was hers. No one else could even touch them. \n\nI didn’t care if she was mean to me. I worked there for 4 years. I just hated when she was mean to patients or my coworkers. So, if she was extra mean one day, I would mess with her pens. I would take them from her desk and hide them random places, and when she would freak out I would say “M, it’s right here, you must have left it”. I would take other gel pens and switch out the little ink thing. Sometimes I would replace the ink thing with one that was almost empty. On days she was really bad, I would just straight up steal her pen, take off the name tag, and use it in front of her. She could never prove I stole it, so I never got in trouble for it. \n\nI did this for about a year before I finally got a job somewhere else and left. I still have one of her pens, and left the name tag on it. On days I’m feeling spiteful, I take it out and use it to remind me about the petty lengths I’ll go to if someone treats my coworkers like shit. ",

So instead, I just stood parallel to the woman and stared at her with pursed lips for the five floors up to my office. She rolled her eyes at me, but otherwise ignored me. Fine.\n\nWell, right after I stepped out of the elevator, I threw my arm in again. And swept my hand on every damn number button I could press.\n\nFrom one bitch to another.. *Enjoy the scenic ride up to the 14th floor.*",

        "text": "Okay so this was a few years ago when I still lived at home with my family. Backstory is that my little brother is a few years younger than me and he was ALWAYS getting viruses on his computer, which I suspected to be because of watching some freaky porn, being a 14 year old teenage boy.\n\n So, one day his computer shit out on him and he told my parents that he had some homework to do online, so he needed to use my laptop, which was a $1300 gaming Asus. I objected to this obviously, seeing how he treated his own laptop which such poor care, spilling things on it and such but I was forced to let him use it. \n\nWhen I got it back the following day, wouldnt you know it, but I had something on there. Running slowly, and my malwarebytes confirmed it.Now this kid wasn't smart enough to use incognito mode on my chrome, let alone clear the history so I see he didnt actually do homework. I cleaned my machine. and was pretty pissed, but then I remembered that my parents were going to buy him a new laptop, (something cheap like his last one) and I decided to wait until he got it to exact my revenge.\n\nAbout two weeks after he got his new computer,when he wasn't home, I went on to it seeing as how this was a windows 7 machine with no password or PIN to secure it, and I went into his host file and put all the sites he had gone to on my computer into it with a loop back address. Now for those of you who aren't aware of what this would do, it essentially redirects him whenever he types those sites it to his own machine, thus giving him a 404 error. I've essentially created a porn blocker in a way I knew he would never figure out how to get rid of. This problem I've caused him is easily fixed by flushing his DNS cache, but he doesn't know a damn thing about any of this, so I knew he would just think it was busted. I also knew he would be too afraid to tell my parents that he broke yet another laptop that was meant for school. Have fun jerking off from your tiny ass phone screen. \n\nTldr; little brother gets porn blocked on his new computer for watching porn on my computer, without ever realizing what I've done. \n\n\n\nEdit: Yes, I definitely used some lysol wipes on my laptop afterwards. Also, addressing the DNS flush, you are right, but I didnt plan on reverting it anyways. ",

        "text": "This happened back when I was in Uni. There was a night club we used to frequent, and I once received a text message saying we would get 4 free beers for that night after a GBP 10 entry fee. I ended up going just because of this offer, and at the gate, after paying the entry fee, was handed some vouchers. For some reason, I looked at them (normally I would just head in), and there were basically 4 vouchers saying buy 1 get 1 free. \n\nI was pissed as I only came out on the promise of free alcohol, and since entry fees were normally GBP 5 for a student night. I asked the promoter stood there, and she just shrugged saying it was what it was. \n\nPissed, I decided to walk out right there and then, and spent the next half hour informing everyone lining up to forget about the free beer. This basically killed their night, and unknown to me, the promoters had called the police citing a 'dangerous person'. \n\nI was approached by an officer, and I explained myself, and my reason for pointing out their deception, and showed him the text message that clearly said what I claimed. The officer was understanding, and went beyond his call of duty to basically tell the promoters off, and asked them to not accept any entries for the night, or he would be back. I managed to screw up their night for half an hour, and they screwed themselves for the rest of the night. \n\nTLDR: I was refused the earlier promised free alcohol and it pissed me off.  ",

        "text": "One of the pettiest slow-plays I've seen, courtesy of my little brother. A quick background, but my little bro (LB) is a huge movie buff. He can quote the entire LOTR trilogy from start to finish, makes a point of hitting the midnight premiers of the newest Marvel and Star Wars movies, loves to read up on every latest scrap of leaked set photos/plot points he can....you get the idea. My other siblings and I enjoy those movies too, but we see them when time allows - usually a few days or even weeks after release. I think LB saw Infinity War 4 times in theaters before I saw it once. That said, LB is EXTREMELY good about keeping all spoilers to himself until everyone has seen the movie in question, and he HATES it when people give any plot points away.\n\nOn to the petty revenge set-up: LB saw The Force Awakens at an early premier when it first came out. Litterally the first or one of the first showings in the USA. He loved it, and could not stop bugging us about going to see it so he could finally talk about the movie with us. My Other Brother (OB) caves and decides he'll change his plans so he can go the following weekend with LB. About mid-week, LB hits up OB and has this conversation:\n\nLB: Dude I can't wait for you to see this movie, it's sooo good!\n\nOB: Yeah that's what I heard, but I already know what happens.\n\nLB: WHAT?! HOW?!!\n\nOB: I was on instagram and some dude commented under ESPN's post that \"Han Solo dies\"\n\nLB: SHOW ME\n\nWell sure enough, OB sent a screenshot of the comment in question. It was some random kid who probably thought it'd be funny to ruin one of the most awaited movie releases of the decade by spoiling it on a very public instagram page. LB is furious, but he had a plan.\n\nThe Petty Revenge: LB finds the spoiler's instagram account. Lo and behold, it's some highschool age looking kid with a public profile (you don't have to be friends with them to see their posts). He makes note of the username, and vows revenge. FYI this was December 2015. 2 years later, the next Star Wars movie (Last Jedi) is set to be released. What does LB do? He keeps tabs on mr spoiler's instagram account for 24 months until December 2017. LB of course goes to the very first first showing of The Last Jedi. As soon as the credits roll, LB fires up instagram and direct messages this kid all the spoilers from a burner account. A few months after that, he does it AGAIN for Infinty War. The kid made his account private after that.\n\nTL;DR - Brother waits years to spoil huge movies for a random kid who spoiled the plot of Star Wars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Well to start off this took place in middle school. When Pokemon emerald first came out my dad bought it for me, my dad didn’t have much money back then so this was like a birthday gift that I have been wanted since it was announced . I took it to school to play it on the bus. When school was over for the day we loaded back on to the bus and went home. On the bus ride there was this boy that notice that I was playing with my gameboy advance and ask what game I had. Told him I was playing Pokémon emerald. He asked if he could play the game while we were on the bus I said it was ok and let him play it on his own gameboy sp which I was ok with. After we got close to his stop I asked for my game back. \n  He then tells me that he didn’t have it and that he gave it back to me. I was so pissed because I knew for a fact this guy was about to steal my game and get away with it. I kept asking and asking and even telling him to stop playing. Well since we were the last three people to be dropped off and his stop was about to come up. I thought of a plan to get my game back. So while on the bus I crawled up 4 seats in front of me and since everyone had the habit in middle school of putting their book bags on the floor of the bus I went up unzip his bookbag and grabbed two handfuls of games as quickly as I could hoping to get my game back. I ended up coming out with 6-9 gameboy games. But not mine. But I was still happy because I think he only had 1 other game left in his bookbag after I stole his games. I crawled back to my seat clean myself off since it was dusty and played all those games that he had. I think he had my game in his pocket never again shall I let my stuff get borrowed. He had a great selection of games too. ",

        "text": "Last month I took the afternoon off work to attend a lengthy doctor's appointment. It ended much earlier than I thought, so I decided I wanted to go exploring on some backroads in the mountains and forest about an hour away from town. I wound my way through the suburbs and outlying towns along backroads and state highways before I finally got into the country, where I would shortly be merging onto the main highway between my town and the mountains. Even though it's a major highway, it's only one lane in each direction at the spot of the merge and a few miles beyond.\n\nAs I'm preparing to merge onto the highway, I notice there's a truck that I'm not going to be able to overtake. Fine, I can handle being behind a truck. Behind him, maybe about 200 feet back, was a beater Honda or something. Cool, there was enough room to merge between the two, so I eventually signal and start to merge over. I look in the mirror to find that the beater Honda has significantly closed the gap, maybe now less than 40 feet from the truck and approaching fast. I basically have to muscle my way into the lane before it ends and I hit a jersey barrier. Beater Honda then rides my ass and honks at me angrily. It's two younger dudes. The driver is a total neckbeard. In fact, I'm gonna call him Neckbeard for the rest of this post.\n\nIt was at that point that the speed limit dropped from 55 to 50 for about 5 miles before the road widens from 2 lanes total to 4 and picks back up to 55. The entire section is also a no-passing zone, which you couldn't do anyway because of how busy this highway is in both directions. You might see where I'm going with this.\n\nNow, I'm not one to stick to the speed limit. I would've been going at least 55 through that portion, probably even 60, had Neckbeard not been such a speed demon asshole and almost run me off the road. Plus, I know for a fact that cops *love* to hide out on this road a lot. On top of that, I was pulled over for speeding that very afternoon, and was fortunate enough to get a warning. So being the petty yet cautious and concerned asshole that I am, I set my cruise control at 51 MPH so that neither of us are caught speeding. After all, I don't want a ticket myself and would feel absolutely *horrible* if he got one.\n\nThe truck I was behind started to pull away slightly and eventually turns onto a side road maybe a mile before the road widens. Yet there I am still puttering along at 51 MPH on the only lane going my way. I can see that Neckbeard is pissed, but I don't really care. No skin off my nose if my drive through the forest is maybe a minute later than I would've been.\n\nEventually, the road widens up to 4 lanes and the speed limit picks up to 55. Because I'm not a *total* asshole, I drop into the righthand lane so that Neckbeard can pass me. Sure enough, as expected, he punches it up to at least 65, pulls into the left lane and flips me the bird out the driver's side window. I was expecting it, so I simply gave him a huge smile and a wave, looking like [Bob from those Enzyte commercials years back](https://i.imgur.com/iWyl4YW.jpg). I'm sure he wasn't thrilled that I knew his game, but I was happy that I mildly inconvenienced him. Maybe he won't be such an impatient douchecanoe next time.\n\ntl;dr Stuck to the speed limit through a known speed trap, causing the guy behind me to go crazy after almost running me off the road.",
