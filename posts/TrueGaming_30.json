        "text": "After watching the trailers for the Let's Go! games, I've had this somewhat contentious thought. Would the pokemon games be better served if they didn't have random battles? For context, I've played every mainline pokemon game except for Black and White, and while I love all of them, the biggest hangups I have on the games are the random encounters out in the wild. Now I'm not talking about the random encounters themselves, but rather having to battle wild pokemon in general. \n\nMost of the time, you encounter a wild pokemon, it's one that you already have or don't care to catch, you steamroll it with one of your main pokemon and you continue on. The problem is, this often takes a considerable amount of time, including the amount of time it takes for the loading screen to happen, the animations for attacks, the text boxes, and the like. I would say over the course of the game, there's really only a handful of battles that actually matter in the wild, and most of those are with legendaries. All of the other, vastly more interesting battles, are the ones with trainers. \n\nSo surprisingly, I'm coming to the realization that I would be totally fine with them nixing all the wild pokemon battles and instituting some fun way of catching them outside of weakening them and using a pokeball. That said, I don't think the pokemon go style is the way to go. It doesn't have a lot of variety, is painfully easy, and doesn't change from pokemon to pokemon. \n\nHere's my pitch: \n\n1. Eliminate all wild battles except for legendaries. Legendary pokemon should have to be battled, but their difficulty should be increased, and the only way to catch them is to defeat them entirely. Right now the process of catching them is fine, but one slip up or one unlucky critical and you have to reset your game to fight them again. That's incredibly tedious, so essentially making them boss battles would be much more interesting. \n\n2. Up the number of trainer encounters to compensate. Without the wild battles, there still needs to be a way to level up your pokemon, and the trainers are the best way to do this. Being able to fight trainers multiple times would also help if grinding is still needed. \n\n3. Catching wild pokemon should be more interesting. My idea for this is to have each pokemon in their own habitat, sort of Monster Hunter style. Catching each one would be an exercise in finding them, luring them, trapping them, basically a little mini puzzle for each one. That way, you're typically going out to find a specific one, and you can mostly ignore the rest of the pokemon. Potentially you could have some wild ones be hostile just to make the traveling more interesting, but they should be more like the fights in Sun and Moon, where there's multiple of the same monster to make it more interesting (but dear lord get rid of the \"call for help\" mechanic). \n\nOverall, I think this could help streamline the game, make catching wild pokemon more interesting, and eliminate some of the frustration of going back and forth trying to find a specific pokemon and having to fight dozens of ones you don't want in between.

        "title": "Did anyone else feel Metro Last Light was a disappointing sequel to 2033?",
        "author": "TrynaWrite",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8ntdjz/did_anyone_else_feel_metro_last_light_was_a/",
        "text": "Nearly a year after finishing Metro 2033 for the second time, I finally got around to playing Last Light. Having enjoyed 2033 immensely, the year of waiting only served to hype me up for what was largely a disappointment and a game that I never found myself really enjoying. It's difficult to nail down exactly what made Last Light, in my opinion, worse than 2033, considering how similar the two games are in many aspects, but I think I can identify some areas.\n\nTo start with, I would like to highlight the plot which I found extremely uninteresting throughout. The reason behind Artyom's journey in Metro 2033 was simple but urgent. You needed to stop a dangerous enemy from wiping out humankind. But just how dangerous is this enemy? And does humankind deserve to be saved?\n\nIn contrast, I never felt the same urgency in Last Light. I never felt compelled to chase after the Dark One, which was unfortunate, because that was all the plot was really going to give me. You simply move throughout the Metro chasing the Dark One from place to place. Along the way, you learn the Reds are doing bad stuff, but I couldn't muster the slightest bit of curiosity as to what and when I found out about the disease, my reaction was, at most, 'Well, that's the Reds for you, eh?'\n\nI just don't feel the game ever gave you a reason to care in this one. Hell, there was never a truly legitimate reason for chasing the Dark One down except for Artyom and Khan having a hunch that 'maybe he's a good guy?'\n\nAnd with the mention of a companion character, I move onto my second area of disappointment. When I first played 2033, I was surprised, pleasantly so, to discover just how much you are escorted by interesting characters who help you along the way. 2033 was sometimes billed as a survival horror, and as such, I expected to be predominantly on my own. Instead, I found that Artyom spends maybe half the game with someone and I loved this about 2033. It added so much to the world to have a companion keeping the dialogue flowing with insights into old metro stations or the shadows, etc. Bourbon, Khan, Uhlman, Miller. You got to spend time with these characters and developed a sense of camaraderie as a result.\n\nThis all but disappears in Last Light. The section with Pavel was good, but that's about it. You will spend most of the game by yourself, accompanied only by silence. Some might argue that this is more in line with Metro's horror theme, but I felt it only weakened the game, mostly because the Metro games thus far do not stand up on their own as shooters. It's playable but the mechanics just aren't tight enough. It needs something else to fall back on, e.g. world, characters, story.\n\nApart from Pavel, you get a short section with Anna, a character who was so underdeveloped, she had no real reason to exist. Her impact upon the game is minute and I think her actual screen time is likely within the ten to fifteen minute range. You meet her at the beginning where she is incredibly condescending to Artyom despite his prior achievements. You won't see her again until about halfway through the game when she is immediately captured, and then you will see her again after you have rescued her, at which point you spontaneously decide to have sex. I felt nothing for Anna and the relationship with her felt very forced.\n\nThen you have the returning characters, your old friends: Uhlman, Khan, Miller \\- all of whom are criminally underutilised. Khan comes with you a couple of times, but rarely, if ever, to fight. You will serve alongside them in the final battle right at the end, but only if you get that far.\n\nI think few would argue that the Metro games are at their best when you are in the Metro. It is within those tunnels that a whole new type of society has developed, and I may as well take this moment to say that this is one of the things Last Light does well. The excellent visual design of these stations carries over from 2033. Whether it's Bolshoi, the culture capital of the Metro, home to The Theatre, or Venice, a flooded station navigated by barge \\- the stations are always worth observing. With shanty towns and makeshift bars, and the surprisingly large amount of dialogue written for casual NPC's which you can stop to listen to or ignore depending on your mood \\(which also makes its return from 2033\\), it's honestly really cool to see how a underground station could actually be used as a home and easily my favourite part of Last Light.\n\nBut back to complaining. See, 2033 kept its above\\-ground sections short and sweet. They didn't drag, you weren't constantly having to go up and down and they were also reasonably easy to navigate.\n\nLast Light does not do this. You're out on the surface a lot more and I certainly got confused about where I was supposed to go a little more than I would have liked. The fact is that the surface is **BORING**. I dislike objective statements like that but I think most would agree. We've all seen post\\-apocalyptic landscapes and there is nothing particularly special about Metro's. It has the bombed\\-out buildings, the grey skies, the mutants, the radiation; all things we've seen before. It's underground where the uniqueness of Metro's world stands out and that's where its focus should be. Watching the trailer for Exodus leaves me somewhat nervous about this.\n\nMy final major complaint is, in fairness, one that I levelled against 2033 as well, and that is multiple endings. I find that I am of the ever increasing disposition that multiple endings are being implemented into games that do not need them, but that is a post for another day. Specifically, in regard to Last Light, I wasn't hugely impressed with ending I got \\- the 'bad' ending \\- in which Artyom and friends blow themselves up, annihilating Rangers and Reds alike. Then a short cutscene in which Anna tells their child how his Daddy saved the Metro, a statement I have serious reservations about considering the one major power left to fill the vacuum is the Nazis. Overall, I just felt this ending was a pretty shoddy way for Artyom to go out.\n\nAnd then I discover that that ending is not the 'true' ending, and that Exodus will continue with Artyom as protagonist following the other ending which is canon. What is the point in this? As far as I'm concerned, Artyom died right there and then. That is my experience and thus, to me, is the only experience. It's hugely immersion shattering to play through a game, only to be told that your version of events didn't happen. Things happened differently and you just have to pretend that they happened the same way to you. This is all made worse by the fact that I didn't even have a proper part in determining this ending and I honestly don't know how I got it. Because I killed Lesnitsky and Pavel? Two evil and dangerous men who deserved to die for what they had done? I certainly didn't go out of my way to do evil things. I left the demon defending her baby alone and saved the mother bear, yet I wound up with the 'bad' ending which, as it turns out, didn't even happen.\n\n2033 did this exact same thing and it was just as bad. If you were able to save the Dark Ones, what motivation do you have to return to the sequel where, despite your version of events, you killed them anyway. At the end of the day, if you're going to spawn a sequel in the aftermath of the effects of the previous game, just have one ending. It simply doesn't make sense to have two, only for everyone who got one of them to have it written off. The only effect it achieves is the breakdown of immersion and a lesser connection with the world as a result.\n\nI'm going to keep my eye on Exodus. The respect I built up for the Metro franchise during 2033 has not totally disappeared, but after the letdown of Last Light, I'm certainly now a lot warier than I was before.",

Just Cause 3 playing only in cleared areas where there's no gunfire was a pretty great way of teaching them about the scale of landscapes, skies, mountains, rural vs. surburban vs. urban, beaches, oceans, going underwater, etc. Plus they like the cars. Great tourism simulator.\n\nBut at what age do you feel ok letting them see people getting hit with swords, or shot with guns? Son's 6 now and I'm easing up a bit, letting him start to see watch low blood/gore violence because he's a good sensible kid. Daughter's close to 3, but I'm less concerned with what she sees because I don't think there's as much risk of girls swinging sticks around whacking other kids and glorifying aggression. So parents, how have you been handling this stuff at home?\n\n",

        "text": "Relatively recently, it was announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 won't have a single player campaign \\- instead it will focus on multiplayer and the \"Blackout\" battle royale mode.\n\nWhilst many multiplayer\\-only games are successful and popular \\(Overwatch and CS:GO just as a few examples\\), the thing about this is that CoD has traditionally been a series with a single player campaign and not just multiplayer, so in this year's Call of Duty they've decided to ditch the traditional SP to focus on multiplayer and the popular Battle Royale trend.\n\nFallout 76 has just been revealed and the fact that it'll be an online survival RPG \\(as opposed to the previous Fallout games all being single player AFAIK\\) deviates sharply from how the series used to be.\n\nThese are examples of how some games that traditionally have single player are turning in a multiplayer direction \\(at least for their next game\\).\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nI found this quote from [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/11/10/are-video-games-becoming-too-focused-on-multiplayer/#722c217d7d12) about multiplayer games, and whilst it's *not necessarily true* that every multiplayer game is created only for this purpose, developers must undoubtedly be influenced by potential profits as well.\n\n&gt;Simply put, for developers, building a multiplayer\\-only game is often a cheaper, easier experience that designing a massive single\\-player experience complete with huge linear or open world levels to serve only one player at a time.\n\nI don't think I'm informed enough to give reliable input on how accurate this statement really is, but money undoubtedly has to play a role in design decisions like this \\- why wouldn't they want to maximise their profits?\n\nThere's also the fact that multiplayer games obviously require adequate numbers of other players to play them, and in older MP games where the player count has dropped very low, the main servers usually get closed down and you can't play the game anymore unless the game allows you to host your own servers. Titanfall's player count dropped very quickly in part because of a lack of content and how it was multiplayer only without a campaign.\n\nThat said, it's clearly possible to make multiplayer only games that stay \"alive\" and populated for a very long time \\- TF2 and Counter\\-Strike come to mind.\n\nWhat do you think of this shift towards multiplayer games? Is it a good or bad thing for the game industry?\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI really enjoyed this game and was a huge fan of the first one; I also still have itches to play but decided it was best to uninstall for now. I have come to the conclusion the difficulty curve for this game is too much for me as of now.\n\n\\*\\*Examples or Absurd Difficulty Scaling:\\*\\*\n\nAt first when I pressed “x” while in the supply locker my character with a free slot didn’t learn a utility skill after two books. I then take my last book and then put it in my characters inventory, press “x” and still no utility skill is given. I get the dialogue but no learned skill after three tries with similar dialogue of “YEAH ITS NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN SOMETHING”. \n\nI think my playthrough is bugged so I just finish my legacy mission and start a new game, recruit a survivor with a free slot. I read a medicine book and it’s all great, skill learned! I then move bases and have two utility books. By this point I have two brand new characters with free slots. I put the books in their own backpacks and consume the books. The dialogue plays but no skill was learned. I was blown away by the realism of this game mechanic of secret skills. Apparently certain survivors have a fifth hidden skill that does not show up at all, you only learn them by completing certain actions or meeting specific requirements. In my situation I hypothesized that my character’s fifth secret skill is “illiteracy”. I grind a few hours to test my theory and finally find two more utility books. At this point I recruited another survivor with a free slot, put the book in his bag and the original survivor I mentioned. With the new survivor I drove away from base and pressed “x” then voila! I got the skill! For the original survivor, I drive away from my base press “x” and boom bam, my character is literally retarded! I do the legacy mission and go to my third, and current, playthrough.\n\nI’ve read three utility books, a gardening book, and a medicine book on four separate characters inside and outside of my base across multiple bases, including the starting area. This is crazy because I hear the game is too easy and I agreed partially due to the simplistic combat. However, the difficulty scales by disallowing your survivors from being able to read books due to the prolonged zombie outbreak. Moreover, when zombies are on the ground they tend to glitch in houses, walls, boxes, toolboxes, vehicles, and pallets so you cannot execute them due to your character not comprehending the evolution of the zombie virus breaking laws of physics. \n\nMoreover, there was once a survivor I had who had the secret skill known as “kamikaze” and it was a blast to discover. I was making a normal meds run in my upgraded ambulance and swerving pixel perfect through debris of broken down vehicles. My ambulance lightly taps a guard rail, spins on its headlights at light speed, blows up and my boy Goff died a hero’s life by killing a lone crippled zombie. \n\nState of Decay 2 makes Dark Souls look like a family day at Chuck E Cheese’s. I hope the developer patches the game to be more accessible/easy for those that earnestly love the gameplay loop \\(\\+40 hours of gameplay\\). I genuinely had to uninstall this game because of the extreme difficulty scaling.",

The problem is some people think the merch is *REALLY* cool.  The merch ends up making 10x more profit than the developing cost of the movie and they can make it really cheap.  You think that's cool, but you'd really like a new movie.  New movies usually come out every other year, but it's been 4 years and still no new movie, but there's new merch every other day that people love.  The developers of the movie then put out a quiet announcement saying they've mostly just been focusing all their efforts on their merch devision and it will be many years before we get a new Godzilla movie.\n\nThis is how I see games a service.  It happened almost 100% with GTA Online.  It took almost double (triple?) the normal development timeframe to go from GTA5 to the new Red Dead.  Now there have been developers who make games that I love that I just hope their next attempt at games as a service falls flat on their face.\n\nTake Bioware for example.  They haven't had the best luck with getting a good game as a service out with their attempts at putting them into DAI and Mass Effect (I think ME got a game as a service component in the last game, but correct me if I'm wrong).  Now with Anthem coming out, I'm really hoping it fails and fails hard.  If it's successful, it can only mean they'll be focusing more on Anthem and less on games I love like Dragon Age.  Even then, if they implement a successful microtransaction service into the new Dragon Age (as they've said they're interested in doing), what's stopping them from going the GTA route and abandoning development of anything else to put in kitschy cosmetics for Dragon Age 4?",

        "text": "I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm concerned that public opinion of how MMO content should typically work has changed. I've seen multiple times that people consider the leveling content to be the tutorial of the game. That it should be fast, easy to pickup, and rocket you to end-game as fast as possible. Of course leveling content teaches players how to play their character, but that needs to be a slow and methodical process. And you know what I find ironic? Those same games that do that end up running out of content to keep you busy with, OR revert to a grind to keep you interested. This weeks rerelease of Bless Online has been the most insane example I've ever seen. Players hit maximum level within less than 16 hours. \n\n\nHave players forgotten that it's all about the journey and not the destination? If you keep wanting to rush to end-game in every MMO or RPG you play, you will quickly run out of things to do. This is part of the reason why in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, the term \"content drought\" was coined. The more leveling speed increased, the more focus that was put on end-game, the more negative overall effects and impacts there was on the sense of community and overall health of the game.",

        "text": "Like many of us here, I'm a pretty hardcore gamer, and it's pretty common in our communities to have people whining about how handhold-y current games get. This is always from our point of view - it's pretty hard to feel compelled by a game when we're on our two and our pokémon catching tutorial still isn't over.\n\nIt might be merited though. I've bought a Switch this December and the more I share it with casual, phone or non-gamers, the more I see that game devs who dumb down their games have a point. I know this is all anecdotal, and I'll provide my arguments and the logic behind them in the end, but this what got me to think about all of this:\n\n* Button functions being forgotten constantly, even for the most basic of games (I'm talking about Nintendo family friendly levels of basic here). I had to constantly remind people in a group how to do stuff in Rayman Legends, despite you being able to play the game with literally only one button + the D-Pad (which you can jump with if you forget B does that).\n\n* While playing Mario Kart with my family, famously a very simple game (just three relevant buttons + steering), all members of my family (young and old alike) did nothing but drive forward and steer slightly. No item usage at all, no drifting, a lot of grass mowing for those who I forgot to put the assist on for.\n\n* Playing Fifa, they just kept running into players while holding the ball instead of passing it, shooting it, attempting to run around or anything else.\n\n* Same goes for Splatoon and any other shooter (top down, first person, anything) we tried - they ran in the direction of people while shooting instead of trying to not die.\n\n\n* Most of my cousins and my ex (21) thought Hearthstone was too confusing to get into, and there was too much stuff to keep track of.\n\n* It was agreed unanimously by my younger cousins (ages 7 to 15) that both Odyssey and BOTW were too hard, after they died a couple of times. Odyssey, the game that is constantly maligned for being TOO kid-friendly by some big names in the game reviewing scene, they especially disliked, as according to them the game was ugly and at least BOTW was pretty.\n\n* Weirdly enough, Fighting games worked out fine.Turns out you can still beat people at KoF or Tekken by button mashing or repeating a move you thought was cool over and over. The skill floor for these is really underestimated. The task at hand being simple also helps.\n\n* Even more weird, Smash of all fighting games was the most confusing because there were no health bars easily showing you how close you were to death, the camera is zoomed out and characters move in quick jolts.\n\nThese are mainstream titles, famed for being too easy or dumbed down compared to alternatives or previous iterations. It might be a symptom of mobile gaming, with all of the touch controls and direct prompts for everything. Mobile gaming might also be an issue when we consider fail states - those games avoid making the player feel like he ever failed, so fear of failing when faced with console games where that is a possibility leads people to not try, or to quit after the first sign of failure.\n\nBut if companies want to appeal to non-hardcore gamers, these are the people they have to appeal to. I didn't need an extensive tutorial when getting into Pokémon LeafGreen at 6 y/o, but *kids these days* might if they start feeling lost. And they do, often. \n\nI mean, I can't be the only one surrounded with people who look like they just got lobotomized every time someone hands them a controller. And I'm talking people who are usually very smart, college educated and all.\n\nArin from GameGrumps makes the usual hardcore gamer argument [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM), about how there are too many prompts nowadays and good game design will teach players along the way. The issue is, it won't, because modern players won't be paying attention half the time, will die, get frustrated and leave the game before they ever had the chance to learn. You cater to your audience, and if that audience has no attention span, you need to accomodate for that. \n\nYou do that by both having more prompts/tutorials, simpler schemes and more realistic graphics.The ex I mentioned beforehand who was dumbfounded by Hearthstone was a huge Uncharted, New Tomb Raider, The Last of Us and Final Fantasy XV fan. These games aren't hard to understand, there are no visual abstractions made, and for the most part they play themselves.\n\nAnother solution, which I saw in the fighting game example, was matching the goals of your game to the mind state of your player. If you're playing a game that simulates real competition (from sports games to stuff like WWE 2k18), you want players to be able to have fun in that specific mindset without a lot of experience. This worked in older FIFAs - sometimes all you needed was to run to the right and fidget around with the d-pad, or load your shots with a ton of power from outside the box to score. The casual appeal of these games is being ruined by turning them into these mini-game-like, timing-centric affairs. When I'm playing WWE 2k18, I want to feel like I'm beating someone up or struggling to get back into the fight - the older games had you be able to get out of annoying situations by mashing on the buttons, now it's all timing-based to \"reward skill\". It's another level of dissonance - if I'm getting pinned and am super crazy trying to get out, the last thing I'll be able to do well is a timing mini-game.\n\nGames are more expensive than ever nowadays, and it's starting to ruin them by introducing toxic elements such as microtransactions and lootboxes. I see handholding as another one of those things companies are essentially forced to do for fear of not being able to cover for their budget. That, and if we want games to reach a wider audience and be rightfully recognized as art, wouldn't we want them to be able to appeal to those audiences properly? What I'm saying is, is it that wrong that games hold your hand a lot nowadays?",

Doesn't matter how you get there, stopping is optional and there's never really any mystery about what may lie over that next hill or need to prepare for anything.\n\nRecently I went on a massive Tolkein binge and  read all his books.  Ending my marathon with The Hobbit left me itching for another adventure, this time in a game as I felt that type of story lends itself FABULOUSLY to games but I never see games attempt it.

        "text": "I've been playing GTA online with some friends the last few days and it made me realize something. The game is all about having millions of dollars, and all the best sports cars and jets and whatnot. But you never feel a sense of wealth or value. I think the reason is that the difference between a 100k car and a car costing 3 million is certainly noticeable, but not huge. They both take you from A to B. The only thing that felt like a good \"investment\" was a helicopter that can shoot rockets, at least so far. The Chopper was a small gamechanger because it does make you significantly more powerful and gives you new opportunities. And I think thats what its all about: How much utility something gives you determines how valuable it feels to you.\n\n I think a lot of games make the mistake of giving the player mountains of gold and jewels and epic swords of dragonslaying+3, but you soon find out that you can't buy anything useful with it, and that the sword of dragonslaying+4 is just around the corner. Some survival games are an exception to this. I really like \"The long dark\", and one of the reasons is that the game manages to make the small things matter. A rifle cartridge or a box of matches in that game feels much more valuable than any ferrari in GTA Online, and if you manage to fill up your shelter with fishes and elk and can relax at the fireplace with your rifle and axe and knife all in perfect condition, the game makes you feel like a truly rich man (or woman). \n\nDo you have examples of games that can pull this off? I think some MMOs manage to do it too, but there value simply comes from the time you had to invest to get a specific piece of gear, and for me the knowledge that it will be near worthless when the next expansion comes kinda taints that. This aspect of gaming can be hugely entertaining to me, and I think it improves any game that can pull it off. ",

        "text": "On mobile devices, there are currently many high\\-quality games, but the App Store and Play Store are also full of a lot of free\\-to\\-play \"games\" that put significant restrictions on you, or give you significant disadvantages, if you don't pay money. These restrictions can take a variety of forms, such as:\n\n**Waiting Times**\n\nThis is when you have to wait a certain length of time before you can progress or advance. For example, in a strategy game, a building may take hours or days of real\\-life time to construct, unless you spend real money for currency that can be used to skip the wait time. Some games have waiting times that can last up to 14 days just for one building to be completed, hindering the player's progress until the timer has finished. \\(Example: Clash of Clans and most mobile strategy games\\)\n\n**Energy Bars**\n\nFor example, the player could be given 5 units of energy to start with, then each mission might use up a unit of energy. If the player doesn't have enough energy left to play more then they have to wait a while for the energy to refill, or spend premium currency bought with real money to continue playing. \\(Example: CSR Racing's gas tank\\)\n\n**Pay\\-To\\-Win**\n\nPay\\-to\\-win features are often very overt in some multiplayer mobile games \\- it can be difficult to compete with other players who have spent money to get better weapons, power\\-ups and so on. What with the current loot box prevalence in paid PC and console AAA games, there are definitely some AAA games that are pay to win, but in mobile titles, pay to win can be even more overt and in\\-your\\-face than this.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nThere is a widely held negative attitude towards mobile gaming in general, because although there are many good quality games, they are few and far between compared to the immensely profitable mobile games that are using these tactics to earn money in such a way. There's also the issue that the common pricing standard for mobile games is free \\(possibly a vicious cycle in that people may not want to spend money on something that may not be good?\\) which turns people away from high\\-quality, premium, paid games in the store.\n\nFurthermore, the games that dominate the top charts tend to be the most popular and profitable games, many of which can use the above tactics to earn money whilst offering the player a very **restrictive experience** if they don't spend money. Whilst they are very popular amongst the population in general \\(Clash of Clans has millions of players every day\\), many of them may not appeal much to people who already play games on PCs or consoles and are looking for deeper mobile titles, who may dismiss them as nothing more than **money grabbing sources of income** for the developer.\n\nWhat can be done to improve the reputation of mobile gaming and draw attention to the fact that there really are good quality mobile games out there, and to show that **not all mobile games are like this?**",

I really don't like being in gold, I feel like I would do a lot better with better team mates. I am a team player, and not bad at it...\n\nAnyways. I feel like I can get to a higher rank, and thus hopefully get better games, with a bunch of dedication. Problem is, well, is that really what I want to be dedicated to?\n\nI've been playing videogames since I was like 4 years old. Calling it a big part of my life would be an understatement. But I'm 21 now, finding myself with a lot less spare time than when I was younger. I've always kinda been more casual about it, playing mostly single player games, and indie games. I guess Overwatch is the first game I've really played \"competitively\". \n\nI just don't know if I want to dedicate myself to it. I don't really gain anything, even if I climb up to the top 500 players, or whatever. I really like the game, and I enjoy it, but even though I spend so much time playing games, I don't know. I feel different about this. More like it's work, and I'm not sure if it's worth it",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8mxjse/game_narrative_vs_player_narrative/",
        "text": "So this is an idea I've been tossing around for a while. The base of the idea that while a game has its own, already formed narrative, the player will always find their own take on the game. \n\nIt is always prevelant during such games as fallout and Zelda, where the player is given choices on how to interact and where to go, so I'll quickly acknowledge that and move on.\n\nFor me, the real meat and potatoes, the interesting bit is player narrative on games which have a defines sequence of events. Traditionally rpgs/jrpgs. \n\nMy favourite and personal experiance/example comes from xenoblade 2.\n\n***Warning. Mild spoilers ahead***\n\nIn my first play through of the game, Rex, one of the playable protagonists was the scrappy underdog. Always in over his head, barely pulling through abd even then it was due to others actions, not his own. \nThis was true to the cutscenes as no matter how quickly or soundly you defeat bosses, the cutscene always has you losing.\n\nThis continues until you're midway through the game, where you start winning. \n\nThe game treats this as rex maturing and growing stronger. For me rex was still scrapping by, beating bosses first try but having to think and stratergise. Mostly because the game is very balanced so if you kill nearly every enemy you come across you will be at the right level to defeat the boss of the area. \n\nThis is combined with the other characters. Tora the tank who I had to keep a careful eye on his health, and Nia the healer. Who wasnt the best healer. The other characters dont get much on screen development. \n\nThis was reflected in the way I played the game. I rushed through area after area. Taking a short moment to ogle the amazing scenery before back to murdering whatever stood between me and the mission marker.\n\nSimulary with equipping and micromanaging my party. I barely put any effort into it as I was making by just fine.\n\nWhen you are given the choice to choose between mythra and pyra, I chose pyra, as she had been my main damage dealer, therefore most useful, therefore the one i felt the strongest bond with.\n\nI beat the game in within 120 hours and was the first of my 2 other friends to do so. \n\nOnce they had finished we talked about our experiances. One hated how Rex was always underestimated, and how good Mythra was. The other didnt use rex at all, instead choosing Zeke, and going on how strong his blade was. \n\nI was very surprised. \n\nAfter the new game plus update happened I started a new playthrough, this time aiming for completion, as the story was no longer new. \n\nThe bonds I formed, and player narrative I experianced was completely different. \n\nNow due to grinding Rex wasnt barely making it against bosses, instead wiping them out easily. \nNia was full healing the party regularly. \nAnd Tora, was now an amazing tank whose health never dropped more than a third. Also, in my head, he  was the most hated being in the universe.\n\nFor tora, I had equipped him with items which made him attain agroo insanely fast. No matter if Rex was the one who pissed off an enemy, they would immediately ignore Rex and beat up Tora instead. To my glee.\n\nAnd character relationships were different too. Pyra was great early game but platued quick, while mythra could lay the smack. \n\nNpcs had a justifiable reason to respect rex now, seeing as he could easily destroy any enemy.\n\nHowever the story which the cutscenes played was still the exact same. Yet for me it was an entirely new game.\n\nIm interested in what other people think, and if theyve experianced the same thing.\n\nThanks for reading it all.\n\n",

'3d fighters' is too broad a term. Also, I mean to include the games for which combat mechanics are highly technical and the main focus, so the 3d zeldas wouldn't be in this group since those game emphasize puzzle solving and exploration much more than combat. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nAre there any other games you guys know of that fit this descriptor? I've been trying to understand the origin, development, and strengths and weaknesses of this particular gameplay style (for instance, even though this sort of gameplay is very technical, it's usually nowhere near as competitive and balanced as regular 2d fighting games and I want to understand why), so if you all have any thoughts or opinions about that stuff let me hear it as well.

Although the monsters have their appeal, in that the fights feel epic and you feel like David vs Goliath taking down a being many times bigger than yourself. However, there's something just very innately appealing about the smaller bosses. They feel more like a duel, a fight between equals that gets my adrenaline pumping. I find that for the bigger bosses, the experience almost feels a little detached as they're so outsized - you're just running around avoiding AoE attacks and getting in a hit here and there. That doesn't mean they're not fun, and in fact, can be quite fantastic in their own right, but I just get that same personal feeling that I do with he \"human\" sized bosses. They feel like a gladiatorial duel. The fight against The Stranger/Baldur in GoW and the fight against Artorias in DS are two of the best boss fights I can remember in recent memory.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?",

I also thought maybe third-person but (as it is one of my inspirations) it might feel a little too much like a souls game in terms of gameplay (dodging, attacking with melee, and adventuring and such).\nI also though a fixed point for the camera, in a 45 degrees angle from the player (somewhere in the ceiling) (static camera where you can see the player moving from an angle).\n\n\nWhat view is the best for my game? Do you have other ideas for the perspective I could use (maybe something I didn't think of)?\n\nThanks in advance to all commenters,\nEthan\n\nEDIT:\nThe player would be able to walk, run, dodge, and attack in 3D many demons and stuff, while also being able to explore the different items in the rooms",

There are already a lot of rumors around it.\n\nWhat other \"surprises\" can Ubisoft have? A new Nintendo game like Mario+Rabbits? AC 2019 (not much of a surprise)?\n\nGenuinely curious.",
