I'll get straight to the point:\n\nI've completed my first year in my master's degree in urban planning in Montreal (in French) and I cannot find an internship in the urban planning field. I applied to over 30 summer offers prior to May and received no responses. My grades are high (GPA &gt;3.5) but I entered the master's degree right after completing a bachelor's degree in geography (also in Montreal) and therefore have no experience related to geography or urban planning whatsoever.\n\nI suspect the issue is that I've been working as a janitor for almost 4 years now to pay for school and it's reflecting poorly on my resume. Prior to this job, I have no white collar work experience to speak of.\n\nI wanted to know based off you in the community \n\n1) If any of you had a similar experience? If so, how did you overcome it? If the answer is to keep trying, trust me, I will!\n\n2) If there's any advice you can give me in relation to what kind of jobs prior to entering the field you suspect made your resume better? If they were white collar jobs, please tell which ones they were. I feel like I need something to make my resume stand out so I can enter these elusive internships.\n\n3) Is my assessment completely wrong and there's something else I should focus on doing to improve my chances of getting an internship? \n\nMaybe I'm worrying too much and the internship will eventually come but I'm trying to get my foot in the door make my degree worthwhile. If I can't even get an internship in the field I don't see how I can get an actual full-time job.\n\nThanks again for taking the time.\n",

        "text": "I'm going to start off with a quick intro to better frame my question. In 2016, I graduated from Stanford, a big driver of startup culture in the USA. In Silicon Valley, when you think of startups, you think of \"disruption\". By that definition, startups are meant to overtake incumbents in any way possible, even if that means constantly fighting with the law \\(Uber, Airbnb\\). \n\nI am not certain that this concept of \"disruption\" is the right way to go about creating optimal city solutions, even if it has been a successful model for a few big companies. Not only do cities have the resources/data to foster innovation, but they also have the ability &amp; responsibility to create policy that ensures these solutions are funded and incorporated into our infrastructure. Most importantly, cities can ensure that the benefits of tech innovation are equitable and fair to all citizens. \n\nI had the privilege of attending the Smart City NY Expo a few weeks ago, with keynote speakers such as De Blasio &amp; Rahm, and I thought a lot about the future role of private\\-public partnerships.\n\nSo, a few open\\-ended questions that I had...\n\nHow do you to teach politicians and city planners to create policies that invest in digital infrastructure and foster innovation? What are their concerns with this space and how do we alleviate those concerns?\n\nWhat role does citizen involvement play with deciding on potential city\\-wide solutions that become incorporated into the cityscape \\(i.e. LinkNY\\)? \n\nHow do you create a playpen for startups to test their urban tech solutions? What does a startup need to be successful in this space?\n\nThe culmination of these questions is this: Do you think that there could be a benefit for a sort of \"design thinking\" workshop/program/membership group, in which innovators, city planners, community leaders, politicians, engineers all come together to: 1\\) connect with each other 2\\) learn how to think holistically &amp; systemically? \n\nAs you might tell, I'm very new to all of this and I'm definitely no expert. However, it's painfully obvious that there's a need for new ways to approach urban tech solutions, as well as ways to foster communication between all of the different agents in this ecosystem. Hope to have a good chat about this and feel free to respond to me directly.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "So this might be an odd question. It also might be off topic. But I find the question quite interesting.\n\nI feel the need to have more ways to think about and understand a city. But I don't quite know how to go about looking into this.\n\nIn many fields you create taxonomies, categories and aggregates to understand things.\n\nIn finance, for example, to understand a company quickly you have revenue, profit, assets, growth rate, P/E ratios, whether a company is public, debt, and perhaps a few ratios.\n\nIn psychology, you have personality types, attachment theory, and taxonomies of mental symptoms.\n\nSometimes these taxonomies kind of have an implicit \"purpose\" in mind. For example, is your house a place to live, a financial investment, or something that you want to not fall down.\n\nSometimes this sort of taxonomy can be kind of indirect. In architecture you might understand the forces that shape how a building looks, as much as the building-as-solution itself. In some sense these forces that shape a building tell you more than the building itself, because if you understand the forces you can predict what a building looks like.\n\nWhat exists for cities? Has someone thought about this (\"the philosophy of urban planning\" perhaps), are there collections of numbers and classifications for cities.\n\nThe things that I've thought of myself:\n\n* Population\n* Density\n* Better measures of density\n* Surrounding urban areas\n* Building form (mid / low / high rise)\n* Surrounding areas\n* Weather \n* Architectural norms.\n* Grids\n* Mixed land use\n\nWhat would an ideal answer look like to me? I guess it would be something like \"there are these three ways of thinking about cities and these are the most important ways of understanding a city in these framings\"\n\nI've made some attempts to classify cities myself but have often been frustrated, and find information difficult to find. Even simple questions like *population* and *density* can be very difficult to answer in a meaningful way with the information easily available on the internet. So perhaps even if you have a wonderful taxonomy it is useless because you can't find out anything about the city without too much work!\n\nI'm aware this comes quite close to \"describe all of urban planning in 50 words\"... and yet this can be done in other fields.",

If so, how do we explain the overwhelming expansion of suburbs even in very predominately white cities?",

        "text": "One superficial answer is: whenever it's cheaper to build up than out. But what leads to this? Let's suppose I'm a company looking to build my location. High demand for land will obviously raise the price of land, but why can't I just move my company location to a less urban area with cheaper land? This location might be further away from the metropolitan area, but why would I care about this as a business? Many businesses sell services that do not require physical proximity to a metropolitan area, and even if their business is predicated on physical proximity to a metropolitan area this can be relatively easily accessed. Perhaps a business may demand a certain talented workforce (which is centered around a metropolitan area), but what does a business care if their employees have to commute from a metropolitan area to a cheaper area?\n\nAs a business, I'll do whatever makes the most financial sense. Under what circumstances would make having a skyscraper make the most financial sense? As long as I can hire qualified employees and sell all  my goods and services to my target customers (all things that it seems I can do much more cheaply on cheaper land), why would I ever build a skyscraper?\n\n\nAlso, why not build down instead of up when land prices are so high? Many cities regulate the height of buildings too, so I would expect to see more incentive to build down (yet in practice, I am not aware of many examples of this).\n\n\nAs an aside, I love skyscrapers and metropolises, and I am just an uneducated layman looking to understand the theory behind practice.",
