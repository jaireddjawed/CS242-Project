Thinking about it, I think her, Joyce Randolph, and Bob Barker might be the last ones still around. If you want to include people who were children on TV in that era, you can include Jay North, Jerry Mathers, Keith Thibodeux, and Jon Provost on the list. Is there anyone else left I am forgetting? Maybe a few of the kids on the Danny Thomas show? Sad that we’re maybe only another year or two away from the end of the first era of television.",

It starts out incredibly strong but by seasons 6-7-8 it's just so, so bad. The writing is awful, the characters weak and shallow, the plot has unforgivable holes and inconsistencies.. it's so disappointing. I was regularly finishing episodes literally angry at how bad it was.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Star Trek podcast The Next Generation, which is hosted by two film nerds who, though they love star trek, are not afraid to point out when episodes are awful and explain exactly why.

So far the jokes just aren't landing for me, personally. I can see where maybe younger females may, but so far it just isn't for me.\n\nThe whole premise is weird tbh. Leia gets drunk on the water tower (she's 14), and as a *reward*, Eric and Donna let her stay with Kitty and Redd? Make that make sense.\n\nI like Gwen, she's the most sincere character. Ozzie is kinda a stereotypical gay dude. The other 3 are kinda just there. \n\nI find Leia character to be a little weird. She seems extra horny for a teen girl, and her failed advances on guys is just cheesy. Most of the jokes are cheesy. Honestly the more I watch the more I feel like im watching a old Nickelodeon/Teen Nick show.\n\nThe best scenes involve Kitty and Redd, but it's not enough to save the show so far, IMO. The guest appearances that I've seen so far are pretty cool. It was good to see most of the old cast. The first episode so far is my favorite. Eric and Donna doing the circle up stairs with Red and Kitty was pretty funny tbh.\n\nSo far it's also little on 90s references. Law and Order? Friends? Briefly going over the internet? Try a little harder. Also the reason That 70s Show still resonates with most people is because it was written to be timeless and for a universal audience. There was something for everybody and most of all it didn't come off *cheesy all the time*. \n\nAs said, it feels like a grown up Victorious before a That 70's Show Spin Off. I'm sure this won't be a popular opinion but I felt the need to share. I'm only 5 in with 5 to go, so hopefully, it ends strong, but I don't have high hopes. \n\nWhat are your guy's thoughts?",

Honestly the more I watch the more I feel like in watching a old Teen Nick show.\n\nThe best scenes involve Kitty and Redd, but it's not enough to save the show so far, IMO. The guest appearances that I've seen so far are pretty cool. It was good to see most of the old cast.\n\nSo far it's also little on 90s references. Law and Order? Friends? Briefly going over the internet? Try a little harder. Also the reason That 70s Show still resonates with most people is because it was written to be timeless and for a universal audience. There was something for everybody and most of all it didn't come off *cheesy all the time*. \n\nAs said, it feels like a Victorious spin off before a That 70's Show Spin Off. I'm sure this won't be a popular opinion but I felt the need to share. I'm only 5 in with 5 to go, so hopelly it ends strong, but I don't have high hopes. \n\nWhat are your guy's thoughts?",

        "text": "Does anyone remember a fictionalised documentary on the UK's Channel 4 (I think—might have been BBC 2 though) shown in late 1992 or early 1993, that was a future-gazing \"history\" of the previous 30 years from the perspective of 2022 or 2023 where the world had split into three blocs, being America, \"Sino-Japan,\" and a unified EU? It imagined that the then very controversial Maastricht Treaty (which converted the EC into the EU amongst other things) was the first step to unification. The world was on the precipice of war with Russia having collapsed and the blocs sending troops into Siberia to secure natural resources. I have often thought about it as it got quite a lot of things right, in particular mass migration and fortress-like efforts to stop it. Most of the footage was repurposed news footage of military movements and the like, with some actors playing political leaders delivering \"how we got here\" retrospectives to camera.\n\nI've Googled every which way but it's in that black hole of pre-internet, but not campy / kitschy / cool, or sufficiently mainstream. Would love to see it again as in my memory it was prescient about a surprising number of things. Memorably, one of my house-mates came in half way through, and ten minutes later asked if it was the news…",

The international assassin episode was so much fun and then for Keving to go right back the next episode was brilliant!  One thing that keeps bugging me is the episode or two before that Nora leaves Kevin.  Why?  She tells him to tell him everything, makes a big deal of it.  He tells her about Patty, which is pretty fucked up,  and she's totally fine.  But the second he tells her he is seeing Patty, that's it?  She just peaces out?!  Anybody else notice that or have a good explanation?  Other than that I can't wait to start season 3 and finish!",
