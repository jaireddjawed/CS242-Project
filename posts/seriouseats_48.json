        "text": "[Recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/03/the-best-black-bean-burger-recipe.html)\n\nI LOVE these burgers. Easily the best I've had.. I'll gladly take them over most beef burgers too. I keep having issues with holding them together though. Last night I doubled the recipe, but cut down a bit on the oil used to fry the peppers/onions. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. Had to add an extra egg as they were a bit crumbly. Went to grill them and almost each one totally crumbled. Reallly had issues keeping them together, probably lost half of each burger I made. \n\nI've made these a few times before but in cast iron previously. Had similar issues but was easier to keep them together on the flat surface. \n\nAny suggestions? I had already added an extra egg so idk about another there. Would hope to not have to do more mayo. I'm wondering if it's a binding issue or a textural. Maybe I should be processing the ingredients finer, could that help hold?",

I visited over the weekend and arranged for her to teach me how to make it (the stories were right!)\n\nEverything is pretty straightforward (and very different from other pilafs like Uzbek and Kabuli) one big difference was the use of a really dark sesame oil that they bring from Dagistan called \"Kunjut.\" It had the appearance of molasses with a lower viscosity. She said that it was unfiltered/unrefined, but the color and flavor lead me to believe that it was also toasted and/or fermented. \n\nThere are a few Asian dark sesame oils on Amazon. What do they generally taste like? Usable for deep frying? She diluted the Kunjut in half with canola and deep fried the meat in it. Appreciate any suggestions re: sourcing. I'll post the recipe once I can duplicate it with readily available ingredients.\n",

        "text": "So, I swear I have made this, two dozen times with never a problem until today when I went 0-3 and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. In all three cases the hollandaise failed to thicken/emulsify.\n\nTake 1: ok, I heated the butter in the microwave, but seriously I have done this every fucking time before with no issues, I also used a cold egg yolk (i had some fresh laid eggs I was poaching but figured why use one in hollandaise so I went with store bought from the fridge) I also threw in some smoked paprika because a place I went to on mothers day did that and it gave a really nice color. End result, stick blending while I added the melted butter didn't emulsify at all.\n\nTake two: I thought two things might have gone wrong, first the smoked paprika added before blending could have screwed up the emulsifying process, and maybe I added the butter too fast. So I skipped the paprika and I added the melted butter a lot slower. Still no emulsion.\n\nTake three: ok, so the only things I can think are a.) maybe the cold yolks are screwing things up so I use a room temp fresh laid one, b.) maybe the butter isn't getting to the right temperature so I melt on the stove this time, whisking until it stops foaming, c.) maybe with smaller yolks there's too much liquid so I skip the water ( for now) and just use the lemon juice.... And still no emulsion.\n\nFool proof hollandaise has turned me into a fool. I had to make it the old fashioned way and deliver breakfast 30 minutes late. I'm still at a loss as to what went wrong though. The only thing I can think is the lemon was getting old, but not browning and still tasted fine. My other difference from normal was on the first two, where I melted the butter in the microwave I used a two cup measuring cup because my one cup I usually use was in the fridge, and maybe the change in shape/surface area affected how it melted in the microwave but that still shouldn't have fucked up the third one.\n\nP.s. I know how to thin a hollandaise if it's too thick but does anyone have a trick for making it emulsify?\n\n",

If I do, would I still use the braising liquid, and if so, reduce the amount?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "As a variation on cooking in a sealed pit, I am planning to roast some meat in a steel drum. The videos and such that I have seen on this always have the drum buried in the ground, filled with burning coals, then meat then sealed with paper or foil, the lid and then earth.\n\nTo me burying the drum: reduces the risk of it being bumped into, makes it easier to get food in and out of, insulates the outside and better cuts off oxygen. I won't be able to bury the drum so it will have to be exposed. Rental property and I can't just dig a hole.\n\nApart from the issues I listed is there anything else having the drum above ground introduces as an issue? \n\nHas anyone done this? How was your heat loss?",
