This has to do with the book \"Turning Back the Clock: Hot Wars and Media Populism\" \n\nIn the book, Eco explains the tenets of what he calls \"Neowar.\" It's mostly somewhat intuitive, but there's a part where he talks about how the enemy is behind the lines in Neowar. I see how that's possible (he uses the example of the news giving voice to enemy perspectives), but then he goes on to say that this plays the role of secret services and makes a surprise attack impossible. \n\nI also struggle to see why this is a bad thing? Wouldn't putting the enemy's logic behind the lines promote understanding of the enemy?",

Kelly's lectures on Youtube, some of Dreyfus' lectures, read much of Gelven's commentary and Polt's commentary, as well as other secondary literature. By finished Division I, I mean I read and re-read all of the sections -- some multiple times.\n\nI believe Heidegger only ever provides one definition of Being (found in the first introduction): \" that which determines entities as entities, that on the basis of which entities are already understood.\" (25-26) He uses various phrases like \"the character of Being of \\_\\_\\_,\" \"the mode(s) of Being of \\_\\_\\_,\" \"the Being of \\_\\_\\_\" and also variously says \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ is ontological\" or \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ is existential-ontological\" etc. What are we to make of these phrases with such an impoverished and unclear definition of Being?\n\nAnd he provides the following definition of meaning: \" Meaning is the \"upon-which\" of a projection in terms of which something becomes  intelligible as something\" (193 in Macquarrie and Robinson) This is the definition of *Sinn*, not *Bedeutung* \\-- since Macquarrie and Robinson reserve the noun \"meaning\" for *Sinn* \\-- which is the word he uses in the beginning \"the meaning \\[*Sinn*\\] of Being\" This means he is using the same word for both the primary question of fundamental ontology and the context in which that quotes is given (the part on understanding/interpretation).\n\nPutting all of this together, what can we say is the meaning of Being? Does Heidegger ever answer the question in this book?  I realize that I've only read Division I, and the book is unfinished in its final form, but I feel a little cheated. I'm reading Taylor Carman's book on Division I, and in his review of the secondary literature, it sounds like there isn't even a consensus among scholars as to what Dasein means, and others still disagree over what Heidegger means by Being.\n\nWhat do you all make of this? Are people making things up when they give Heidegger's answer to this question? What is the \"meaning of Being\" after all? Is Heidegger's point about the \"ontological difference\" all moot if we can't even say what Being is?",

I care a lot about transfer of knowledge and I'd be really surprised if someone tried to convince me that philosophy and \"everyday stuff\", or – as Virginia Woolf put it – \"the cotton wool of existence\" are two separate domains that have nothing to do with each other.\n\nAnd at the same time there's a feeling growing in me and an idea of devoting myself to something usually thought of as completely obscure and not necessarily relevant to my own interests. I don't mean to insult any medievalists here, but I'm not really interested in the Middle Ages nor Christianity: it's just an example, because quite a lot of people studying history of philosophy jump from the Greeks immediately to Descartes, I'm definitely not blaming them;) And at the same time I feel some urge of devoting some time of my research to, let's say, Duns Scotus or some obscure theological controversy (and being, at the same time, an atheist), finally learn Latin properly and plunge into that world. Spending years confronting myself with something that wouldn't yield any practical or at least immediate results, but dig down into the archives, read a lot and write a lot in a field that's very foreign to my practical interests. Or, in other words, become a specialist in a field which would make it terribly hard to interest anyone except for a small group of specialists. Or perhaps it's just vanity? It a bit reminds me of the main character of Huysmans' *A rebours*.\n\nSorry for a rambling post, I'm not looking for tips career-wise; it's meant as an open question of steering your research into some unusual paths, perhaps it'll yield some interesting stories ;)",

There is a lot of discussions with the rise of fast fashion (like Shein) and the increase turnover rate of trends, in which people have countered with the notion that people should try to find their own personal style and dress uniquely to themselves instead of following trends. \n\nNow in theory, I agree, especially when it comes to the sustainability and ethical aspects that comes behind the growing fashion industry. However, it seems as though people in these conversations care less about that and more on the lines of protecting their own sense of style so their individuality isn’t threatened. \n\nAnyways, the phrases “do what one truly likes” and “don’t follow the crowd” has been confusing me for a while. What we truly like cannot be an individual experience as we are social creatures and crave to connect with others. One of the main reasons fashion is so popular is so that we can relate to others and have people perceive us in a certain way, so everyone will follow trends at some point.  \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, people advocate to be their own individual and live and dress uniquely but it is, in a way, robbing us of our humanity? Can humans truly, individually be themselves or like something without some sort of previous influence? (This doesn’t have to relate to just fashion also.)",

Is it a transfer from a previous life or is it exclusive to that one body? What really boggled my mind when I thought even more was, when people ask the question ‘what happens after death’, what if the answer right now is you. What you’re experiencing right now. Your current consciousness is the result of you dying in a previous life. If that’s the case, dying is basically respawning as another person.\n\nBut then again, because you’re the only person on Earth who has YOUR conscious mind, there’s no proof that anyone else does because we cannot yet tap into other consciences. I’m imagining it as a string of scenarios - death, then everything becomes black, suddenly you see colour, you hear sounds, you experience touch, you’re now a baby. Your grow up and as your brain develops, you begin to ask this same question. If this is not possible, acquiring your current conscious mind wouldn’t be possible in the first place. \n\nTheoretically, if this was true, then you’d be able to acquire the consciousness of anything with a brain that is developed enough to experience it.

They overthink, they're very nihilistic, they are observably depressed. We've talked about it before, and a lot of their unhappiness stems from both college itself and their philosophy major. Which they've been very open in calling a \"mistake\" which they clarified was never about the money, but because they thought learning philosophy made them greatly depressed. \n\nSince a new semester is around the corner, I want to take philosophy and score some extra credits then get my diploma. It's the best option since it's to me probably the easiest to learn compared to some other courses (that I'm aware of) but I am deeply horrified by the thought I will never be the same afterwards...\n\nIf someone can provide perhaps tips on how to at least minimize the affect philosophy has on someone's mental health, that would be helpful. I need badly. I'm afraid.",

It's difficult to give precise definitions of \"material\" and \"immaterial\" substances (res cogitans and res extensa dont really explain anything... what exactly is thinking and what is extending?). Similarly, from a materialist perspective, it seems difficult to give a concise explanation of what matter is in the first place. Even if we appeal to particle physics and say that matter is at bottom elementary particles, then what are those elementary particles? Are they phenomena whose behaviour can be described by equations and laws? What exactly is the phenomenon in itself? These sorts of problems seem to crop up in any metaphysical system which deals with the idea of substance. Are there any metaphysical views which reject the idea of substance?",

        "text": "Recently I've been reading a lot of old Indian texts such as The Bhagavad Gita and The Arthashastra. \n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a great guide on handling problems which have clearly defined morally right and wrong sides. The Kauravas are objectively bad and the Pandavas are objectively right for the most part. By the time the Kurukshetra war begins, the reader is well aware of the actions of both sides and most probably wants Pandavas to succeed. \n\nThe Arthashastra handles problems which concern the King. Majorly, it is asked for the King to take logical decisions and use their frontal-lobe to tackle public issues.\n\nMy Question:-\nIs there any text that tackles problems which are highly ambiguous due to the lack of evidence. One example would be: If hypothetically, X's wife accuses his brother or some close relative of indecently touching her in private, what should X do in such a case? There can be no evidence of this occurrence which X can use to find the truth. Neither can X disprove the legitimacy his wife's accusation. The Bhagavad Gita, according to my knowledge, does not have an answer for such questions because the ill nature of Kauravas was never ambiguous. The Arthashastra too does not tackle problems where much emotion is involved. \n\nSorry if I seem ignorant on some topic, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong :)",

        "text": "In Political Liberalism, John Rawls introduces the idea of public reason. As I understand it, this means that in just public institutions of justice, the reasoning of moral people that wield political power (e.g. legislators, courts, and voters) on matters of basic justice or constitutional essentials should be based on values any reasonable member of the public could be expected to endorse. For example, it would demonstrate some balancing of the values of liberty, equality, and fairness, but avoid theological doctrines or disputed philosophical positions.\n\nThe reason John Rawls promotes this is with the idea that, even in a society where people have major theological or political disagreements, we could establish a basically stable society, and not simply have this battle where one part of society is trying to impose its conceptions on the other, at least when it comes to these fundamental questions.\n\nA common objection to the idea of public reason would be the incompleteness objection. Namely, it denies that we could ever really settle these questions of basic Justice without appealing to some disputed philosophical position.\n\nThis is also frequently discussed with regards to abortion. John Rawls himself offered it as an example where public reason can provide some insight, excluding theological questions, and instead demanding that people present their reasoning in terms of the respect for human life, the equality of women, and how just societies are able to reproduce themselves over time.\n\nIt's not clear to me what exactly this allows or doesn't allow though. The personhood of the fetus is obviously a disputed question of its own. It seems then that it should be excluded from public reason. But perhaps John Rawls thinks we could avoid that debate by simply talking about respect for human life, even if personhood is not granted. Or maybe John Rawls is saying that questions over where personhood begins are acceptable for public reason, but the kind of answer we form needs to be tempered by the fact that there are several different reasonable interpretations.\n\nThis also led me to question whether certain common arguments about abortion with qualify either as their own disputed philosophical theories, or if they are simply someone arguing for their own reasonable balancing of public values. Judith Thomson's *Defense of Abortion* seems to me like an argument that would clearly be working within public reason, and is simply presenting the best reasoning. But obviously, her argument is disputed. I could ask the same question about Marquis' objection to abortion, which presents a theory that the same reasons we consider murder bad apply to the fetus, even if it is not a person.\n\nI suppose that's the main thing I want to try to understand here. Does public reason limit the types of arguments we are actually allowed to make, when they are disputed? Or are we able to present disputed arguments, so long as these arguments are focused on values that are clearly included in public reason, like personhood and equality?",

Then he goes on to speculate on the original function of consciousness: \"probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food\".\n\nI find it interesting because **we are now reasoning about the properties and functions of x when we have yet to define what x is**. Is this warranted? If so, why? If not, then how do we reconcile the fact that many things that are measured in the sciences seem to be only indexes of some phenomenon x but not actually x itself, and where x is often poorly defined?\n\nAlthough this is most obviously the case in psychology because most things are latent variables (e.g. consciousness, memory, the concept of the self, or happiness, or an \"attitude\"), I am pretty sure it is not restricted to psychology. For example, maybe the concept of \"the economy\" is a non-psychological example.\n\nI find it to be quite problematic but at the same time important to navigate - we still should be able to investigate x even if it is hard/impossible to define x. However, without defining x, can we really be investigating it \"properly\"/sufficiently? I find the notion of a \"working definition\" to be only partly sufficient.",

        "text": "The question is a bit broad, so I'm clarifying the purpose of the comparison. \n\nFirst of all, I don't care whether one adopts a *virtue ethics* or a *consequentialist approach* to answer it, as long as the argument remains coherent. From an ethical point of view, these three activities can be considered morally reprehensible for the following reasons:\n\n1. Adultery breaks the bond of trust on which a healthy relationship is supposed to be built, it can cause serious psychological harm to the person who is cheated on (and to their children, if there are any in the equation), it can damage a person's reputation, and finally it can spread sexually transmitted diseases (in the case of unprotected sex). \n2. Pornography trivializes sexuality by turning it into a spectacle, it tends to objectify women's bodies,  and it can lead to exploitation if it is not produced in good conditions. Other concomitant factors can be added: for example, when the subject consumes pornography too regularly, he (or she) can have a drop in dopamine, erectile dysfunction and relationship difficulties. The use of pornography is usually hidden and rarely damages a person's reputation. It is likely that pornography can cause psychological harm if you are in a relationship or have children.\n3. Prostitution commodifies the sexual act and therefore trivializes it, it necessarily objectifies women's bodies, and it can lead to a form of exploitation. Prostitution can also damage a person's reputation, and it can also greatly spread sexually transmitted diseases (in the case of unprotected sex). If it becomes known that a person is paying prostitutes, their reputation will necessarily be damaged in some way. Resorting to prostitution inevitably causes psychological suffering if one is in a relationship (or if one has children).\n\nAs you can see, I spontaneously tend to rank the harm caused by these three activities in this order, going from the least to the most morally reprehensible (adultery, pornography, prostitution). I know that some measures may qualify the comparison: adultery in an open relationship is no longer really adultery, so called \"ethical pornography\" seems to be more desirable overall, and prostitution can be practiced under good conditions (I guess)... For the sake of argument, however, I simply listed all the bad things that came to mind. I would be curious to see if other redditors can argue against this classification, improve or amend it, for the sake of understanding.",

Ultimately, this is because the West had the wrong, not the correct, religion.\n\nI respect this opinion. But I'm filled up with this overconfident Intellectual arrogance by all these clerics.\n\nIn non-traditional colleges usually you're given primary sources, asked to extracted the meaning of them and provide critique of them, often with discussion seminars.\n\nIn traditional schools, as new student you're not given primary sources and asked to critique them then attend a seminar, etc, not until Masters-level. You're not supposed to question the foundational traditional logic. Even then, exclusively the theories of \"Transcendental Wisdom\" curriculums are taught.\n\nTo use the term Indoctrination and Dogmatization is light. Its truly reminiscent of Scholastic way of teaching.\n\nIslamic Philosophy long evolved above its Aristotlian-Platonic origins, but it still very loosely falls within the traditional Aristotlian parameter. It might share similarities with Scholasictism/Neo-Scholasticism, but they're not identical. Islamics still look upon Scholasticism as \"not understanding Ontology\".\n\nSadly Westerners dont engage with current Shiite Philosophy, so its hard to find material. But, what Materials I can use that help me engage critically along my education? If you're aware of \"Transcendental Wisdom\" philosophy, it'll be more perfect!\n\nTlrd: I'd like material that fundamentally critiques traditional/Neo-traditional Metaphysics, Epistemology, and Logic?

If this is the case (is it the case?) then would there still be value in reading the history of semiotics?\n\nI also have a copy of Gadamer’s *Truth and Method*. Would you recommend simply reading secondary sources on hermeneutics unless I am particularly interested in Gadamer’s thought?\n\nMaybe these works (I’m mostly referring to the semiotics works) are rejected now, but they are useful for understanding intellectual history? \n\nLast, I also have a copy of Saussure’s *Discourse On Linguistics*. Should I read it? Will reading it possibly confuse me when I go to read contemporary linguistics?",
