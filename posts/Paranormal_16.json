        "text": "Hiii I’m apologizing in advance because this is a semi-long read, but I thought I’d give it a go by posting my experience here just out of curiosity if anyone has had any similar experiences! Here goes— \n\nQuick back story: my parents divorced when I was 3 years old and my mom passed away when I was 4. My dad moved in with me and my older sister (who was 9) into the house my mom died in. She died in the master bathroom, and it obviously never felt the same. I'm only explaining that part so it's just easier to understand the awful vibe this house gave off.\n\nI was pretty young, so I'd sleep with my dad in the master bedroom until he left for night shift at midnight and he'd go wake my sister up to join me until he got home at 7. He let me do that until I was about 6, then tried to start making me sleep in my bedroom alone. I wasn't good with being alone, especially in that room. My bedroom was at the back of the house at the end of a long hallway - the other end of the hallway was my sister's room and there was a bathroom in between the two. I started to notice the uneasy feeling I'd get whenever I would walk down the hall to my room, so I started flipping on the light switch before even turning the corner to walk down (I would literally outstretch my arm to flip it before even putting my body into the hallway). I remember the first time I opened my door to it being pitch black and trying to flip my switch and nothing happening. I flipped that damn switch what felt like 50 times before getting so scared that I turned and ran back down the hallway to get my dad. The light turned on for him after one flick of the switch, of course (insert eye roll)\n\nOne of the most haunting things that still sticks with me today was the activity from my bedroom closet. Once, I was laying in bed trying to be grown by sleeping by myself (I usually couldn’t from fear so I’d sleep with my dad or sis) when all of a sudden the light in my closet flicks off - there were no doors to my closet so it was just like a small space that was always “open” so I made sure to leave the light on any time I was in there alone at night. When it happened I remember just intensely but fearfully staring into the black hole that was my closet. And that's when I heard it. My hangers started touching together, ever so lightly. I almost thought I was making it up, but I could see them swaying in the dim TV light. I was too afraid to move; I truly felt stuck but I managed to pull my covers up over my head and forced myself to go to sleep. The hangers touching together happened several times, both during the day and at night. Didn’t matter when, that shit has genuinely scarred me to this day lmao \n\nI never felt unsafe in any other part of that house. Uncomfortable, yes, but it was never to the extreme of being in my bedroom. I would get cold spots in my room, none of my friends ever wanted to go in there, things would move around or be in unusual places even though I could 100% remember the exact place I put them in, toys would turn on by themselves, etc. My furbie toy annoyed my sister so much that she took out the batteries. Days later it came back to life somehow &amp; we found it stuffed under a pile of clothes at the bottom of my closet. My sister &amp; I watched it keep talking and blinking its eyes just totally confused how this shit was even really happening since it very clearly had no batteries?! - big sis then threw it in the street lmao (RIP). We had multiple people that we rented the house to after we moved out who would say they always felt watched, could hear doors and cabinets opening and closing and always just say that they felt uncomfortable at all times but no real explanation as to why. \n\nBut what I can't get out of my head most of all, is the man who watched me as I slept (or didn't sleep). It was a tall figure in the corner of my room, who looked like he was wearing some sort of a hat and dirty shirt, and he would just watch me. It wasn't so much of a shadow as it was just a solid figure standing there. I could feel him watching me at all times. I could feel his presence every time I turned my back to my door to walk down the hallway, and even when I would dance to Britney Spears in my mirror. I saw him through my window while jumping on the trampoline during pure daylight, and he was standing in my closet behind my hanging clothes - I could see his eyes staring at me and letting me know he's watching. After about 2 years of this, he started to come to me in my dreams. It was the same dream every single time, and I still have it today. I'm almost 30 now. I would slide my hand around to flip the switch in the hallway and I'd get to my door and open up to turn on my light in my room and it wouldn't work (like it didn't in real life) and when I would turn my back to my door to go get my dad to help, he would walk into the hallway and drag me into my room. He closes the door and stands over me, then he’d start clawing at me leaving scratches all over my body. I wasn’t able to scream for help or even plead for him to stop. It felt like ages would pass and then he’d unexpectedly stop, return to his corner of my room, and continue watching me. Then the dream ends and I’m awake back in real life, profusely sweating &amp; crying/whimpering like a lunatic. \n\nLast bit! 20ish years later… I was renting the house out to my stepsister and stepbrother. They throw a party, and my stepbrother gets into an argument with his girlfriend who decides to go sleep it off in my old room with her dog. My stepsister woke up at about 3AM to the girlfriend screaming and crying in the hallway. She says that she was trying to fall asleep, but her dog wouldn't stop aggressively barking and growling, and she looks up to see a “tall man just staring at her from the corner of the room”. Y’all…that girl knew *nothing* about my experiences while living there as a child. \nWhen my stepsister told me about it, I instantly lost my shit, as someone would, after spending their entire mf life thinking they made all of these traumatic things up in their tiny lil kid brain!!! \nAnyway—I’m about to be 30, dude doesn’t come to visit me in my dreams as often these days, and after over 20 years I can finally feel a lil less crazy maybe? So things are looking up I guess. Cheers :)",

        "text": "Back in 1984 I was staying overnight at a friend’s shared flat in south London. This was on the ground floor of a large converted Victorian house. There was a narrow path at the side of the house which led to a small paved backyard which the room I was sleeping in faced onto. The place was surrounded by similar houses in a very built up area (not at all rural) not far from a busy main route into central London. I was woken up very abruptly around 2am by the most terrifying noises coming from the side and back of the house. I struggle to accurately describe them as they were so weird, but here goes: high-pitched shrieking alternating with guttural growling accompanied by, what sounded like, two hooves (note, not four) clattering around. It sounded like an animal in a frenzied state which had become trapped and was frantically running back and forth trying to escape - it was maybe about the size of a small pony, but ponies do not growl to my knowledge. This probably went on for about 5 minutes although it felt like a lot longer. It was utterly terrifying - I was sat up in bed and my heart was beating like crazy. I couldn’t bring myself to go to the window and draw the curtain to take a peek out as the picture my brain had conjured up was of some kind of demon, which I didn’t much fancy coming face to face with. \n\n\nAfter the adrenaline had subsided I eventually fell back to sleep and in the morning told my friend and her flatmates about it. They had heard absolutely nothing and I suspect were thinking I’d just had a bad dream - it definitely wasn’t a dream. There were no animals larger than a dog in the surrounding area (which were not running loose anyway) so I have absolutely no idea what the hell it could have been. This incident made a lasting impression on me and still puzzles me to this day. Creepy.",

        "text": "Hi all. I (38f) have seen different entities, for lack of a better word, for about 13 years now. We move every few years and while I haven’t seen them everywhere, I have seen them in multiple homes in multiple countries, and they didn’t have the same appearance or vibes. When we moved to our current house in Oct 2021, I asked not to see anything that might be here, as I needed a break. All good, right?\n\nTwo days ago, I remembered a ring my kiddos took and lost in the house last year. I followed the urge to look under my dresser, which I routinely look under to grab things I’ve dropped, and which I have pulled fully away from the wall to clean behind. As soon as I shone a light underneath, there was the ring against the wall- directly next to a necklace I lost as soon as I moved in, laid out nicely on the floor. Ok then. I acknowledged what happened, and clearly expressed my gratitude for their return. Fine…\n\nUntil last night. My middle kiddo (5f) was in the bathroom, and I walked out for maybe 1 minute to get her more toilet paper. Came back and her eyes were teary. She confessed that she sometimes has “morning nightmares” and had had one when I left the room. I managed to learn that she is seeing something, and it’s not a person. And that it scares her.\n\nOnce, my oldest (7f) came down the hall to read before bed after leaving to get water in the kitchen. Nonchalantly says she saw a ghost, but it might have just been her imagination. \n\nI don’t doubt that 5 is seeing something, and I’m not worried about malicious intention, but it scares her so I want it gone.\n\nI need help knowing accomplish this, and would be grateful for any advice or watching/reading material.\n\nTIA",

But I woke up with scratches alot, not like little scrapes or anything from just everyday activity, but like deep long scratches that looked almost like claw marks, usually in sets of 3 or 4. They were all over my body in random places. When I asked my parents about them they just said \"oh your probably scratching yourself in your sleep or something don't worry about it. But I kept my nails trimmed and couldn't replicate them while awake.   \nThey continued appearing until I moved out of the upstairs bedroom into the now finished basement.   \n\n\nThe second event also in the same bedroom, was I was 16 I think?  I was having trouble sleeping one night, I regularly and still do have some minor sleeping problems, but most nights I slept with my door closed for whatever reason I left it open that night, must have just forgot to close it or something. Anyway I'm tossing and turning I look at my phone its like 3:45am, I'm like Shit i gotta be up for school soon. So I roll over in bed about to go to the bathroom, and I look at my door and there was a white figure, almost looked a man with no face, wearing some kind overcoat, leaning in my door just staring at me. It scared the hell out of me. I rolled back over and kept my head under the covers, checking every so often it was still there just staring at me. Eventually I just passed out and my alarm woke me up for school and it was gone in the morning.   \n\n\nAnyway those were my experiences sorry for the long post, just figured I'd share get some thoughts and opinions. I chalk up the second encounter to lack of sleep, but the scratches I still cant explain.   \n\n\nThanks for hearing me out!",

        "text": "I'd like to share this paranormal experience i had during childhood, it's a bit of a long story so bare with me.\nBack when i was a baby my grandma suffered a stroke, she kept all of her intellect but not much of her body functions (she could walk slowly eat hold things understand everything but could not speak) so it was likely she was trapped inside her body but fully aware of everything, and since my family were having financial difficulty we moved to her place so we could also take care of her, she lived her entire life in the farmhouse she inherited from her parents, it was a old 2 flor house but the first floor oh the house was underground, like a basement but a full house with rooms bedrooms etc, but this part of the house was unoccupied ever since grandpa passed away many years before, and the stairs that led to it in the living room was blocked by copper grid and a big wooden board nailed to the flor while the outside entrance would be always locked. Now my grandma was an extremely religious person and also a very sensitive one so my parents were used to her ways and whenever she acted odd towards something her word was the ultimate one, no one would question it and i was taught to do the same. Fast forward to more or less when i was about 8 years old, i would get home from school while both my parents were at work so it was always just me and my grandpa on the house, she was always very lovely and calm towards me and everything but sometimes strange things would happen and she would completely change, like if she turns into a woman possessed trying to protect her children, things like \"i would try to sneak into the lower house to explore and she was immediately there wherever i was like if she just knew how to find me, and i would her people calling me in random places of the home and she would completely snap and grip my arm hard while looking at random places in the floor and take me to do something else, i remember one time we were on the living room siting on the couch watching TV and i heard my dad calling me from the lower house, before i could answer she hold my arm with such a strength that almost hurt me and kept staring at the tv until i quiet down and fell asleep on the couch to wake up to my parents getting home from work.   More or less at the age of 10 whenever something like this would happen i would just ignore like grandma taught me, this things stoped to happen eventually so she was more at ease, but her health was degrading fast at that time, by the time she was at the end of her life she placed an old bible she always kept with her in a little table directly in front of my room door. From that point on she passed more time in the hospital than at home (leukemia) and passed more or less 2 months after.\nSome time after our family recovered from the grieving we were preparing to move to the city so the stairs in the living room had been removed for inventory and stuff and sometimes it would be left open when they spend time moving stuff (i would never go down there cus it felt odd, like if it was a place out of place hard to explain) A this time period i would only see my father during the weekends, he was on 2 jobs so by the time I would woke up he would have already gone to work and by the time I would go to sleep he was still working. But every weekend i would wake up with he calling me from the kitchen while making breakfast and i would just run to meet him. One time i went to bed on a Friday eager to meet dad in the morning, and sure enough i wake up with he calling me in the kitchen, birds singing and morning sunlight going through the window so i ran to meet him, to get to the kitchen i would go through a hallway that my room was at the end, trough the living room and into the kitchen in the opposite side of it. I swear there was sunlight coming through the windows and i could smell the breakfast he was preparing, but when i open the kitchen door it was pitch black, completely night and empty i stood there for a second to understand the situation and i felt a terrible felling like eminent death extremely overwhelming that it paralyzed me, after a couple seconds i turned back to run back to my room and the kitchen door was barely open, but trough the tiny crevice open i could see clearly the passage to the lower room open, it was at that moment that i understood that however, whatever that was, it had lured me out of my room and away from the bible in the door. But it didn't matter because I collapsed at the door and woke up on the next morning in my parents bad with my mother siting beside me, she said i had a fever and passed out on the kitchen floor, we moved soon after and she would lock my room during the night after that. She kept that history until i was older, more or less at the age of 24 we were randomly talking about those days and she told me that my grandma once drew a hideous deformed looking human during one of the times they asked her why she wanted to keep that part of the home locked, and when my mother saw it she felt a terrible feeling, she felt the same thing when she found me on the kitchen and she admitted that she almost freaked out. She doesn't know how or or why, but she believed with all her heart that this whatever it was, was in that home a long time i my grandma always kept it at bay. Anyway if you read this all, that's my paranormal history.",

I focused my breathing and began to break the grip of the paralysis and it felt like we were mind wrestling. I focused on deep yoga power breathing and eventually broke his grasp on my psyche.

        "text": "Last week was my grandma’s birthday. She celebrated 90 years. The previous day I was at my apartment, on the sofa like a couch potato, relaxed, watching a movie (I was thinking about her though). Literally at midnight (night owl here) the shower turned on. The apartment is quite small and the bathroom is right in front of the living room (the door is next to the wall tv, and it was half open). I was a bit weirded out at first. It went on and stopped. 15min after the ‘incident’, it went on again, this time longer time (30sec to 1minute) running water. This has never happened before. I firmly believe it was my grandpa communicating (or crying) as we already had other instances of things like this happening (for example a bathroom light exploding whilst my grandma was in the shower on a previous birthday day or the ceramic I found with his face in one of my trips - its on my post history if anyone is curious). He was a “healer” person, believed in energies and afterlife and told her “he would come back to pick her up when its time”.

I pulled my phone out and my ghost vox app had opened itself. I still had my Pokemon Go running when I put in pocket. I asked if anyone was wanting to talk. The vox came back with a very clear male voice said \"Hey\". I asked what is your name and all I got was a laugh. I have never gotten a laugh on my ghost vox ever. Needless to say, I left. Ghost Vox does not have anything voice wise preloaded. There are no powerlines etc. Even close to where the cemetery is. Kinda got me. I told whatever it was that it could not follow me home. Hope it is the end of it.",

        "text": "This is my dad's story, he moved in a new studio with his wife. weird things happened to them until they had enough of it. The first encounter of the weird things that went down he was sitting on his bed and in the corner of his eye he saw a black shadow, he didn't think about it that much, but later that night he saw it again and thought nothing about it.\nDuring the night when he went to bed, he was sleep walking in his closet, he walked and heard knives being slammed on the floor. Later, he woke up in the closet since he walked back to it and his wife turned the lights on and my dad's heart was pounding really hard, he said that he felt like something was pulling him, (fyi: the kitchen was clean before the knife incident) A few days later,his wife and him are sitting down and talking,then the ac remote falls with force and it looked like someone threw it, they were creeped out by it. Then, my dad was lying down and the lights turned off and he turned them back on. Here is the best part, his wife and him are talking then his wife turns around to the door and she completely freezes without talking, she said that she saw a black male figure near the doorframe watching them. She mentions to my dad what she saw and my dad is like \"Oh hell nah\". So they have enough of that scary bs and goes to a shop that sells things for people into spirituality and he buys sage then he cleanses his place and the scary stuff never happened again. To mention something interesting, he says that when he bought the place he felt an eerie cold vibe to it. This concludes the story, bye!",

He is isn’t really invested in paranormal things and actually sometimes go through years without even thinking about it. \n\nhe has told me things that has happened he can’t explain. For example he always felt it when someone on his dad side of the family died. It’s always the same kind of feeling and he has never gotten them at any other moment. The person who died always seemed healthy or at least live for a few more years and he didn’t even think about them dying before that. He just very suddenly feels that there is something wrong even if he isn’t even near them. For example when his dad died we were on vacation and the whole morning he just felt lost. We didn’t know his dad would die and he didn’t know as well. Me and my dad went back to the car and my dad just all of the sudden felt that there was something wrong with his dad. A minute later his brother called telling him their dad just died of a heart attack. \n\nMy dad also told me that he knew when the garage at this childhood home would burn down. He was still in elementary school and would always rush to get to school to play with his friends but one day he just didn’t. He went into the garage and looked at every corner and every little thing like it was the last time he would ever see it. He never had done that before and there was no reason for it now. After that he went to school and about an hour later the garage burned down. \n\nHe also thinks or feels when there is a presence of some sort. My mom and dad always “joke” about having a ghost in our house but I know they aren’t actually joking. They have told me that multiple times at night they would see a weird light figure crawl around the ceiling in their bedroom. My mom saw it every night and would wake up my dad and my dad would turn on the light and it would disappear immediately. One night my dad decided to not turn on the light to see if he would also see it and he did. My dad is very technical and he can always explain weird lights or optical illusions but he couldn’t explain this. He had never seen something like it. Both my parents saw it. My mom and dad think it’s the ghost of my mom’s dad. Her parents died and drowned in a car crash when she was 9. Her dad immediately drowned in the car and her mom died a day later in the hospital.\n\nI just don’t know what to think of these stories and if my dad is actually very spiritual connected?",

        "text": "This happened two years ago, but i cant sleep and i keep thinking about it so im posting it here. \n\nI was 17, and my family had just moved with my moms boyfriend into a house he had just finished building. Its interesting to note that my mom and her boyfriend had been dating for two years prior to this and he was a really cool dude.\n\nMy first night in the new house sure was a night, the whole house had that feeling of uneasiness going on. Its also important to note that prior to this id never experienced sleep paralysis. But when i woke up in the morning i couldnt move, and i could hear a dog breathing in my ear and i could even feel its breath. Okay, sleep paralysis, not the vibe but its still explainable right?? \n\nWell it just got worse. Every single night i would wake up completely paralyzed with the dog breathing in my ear again. It kept escelating. One night i heard a dog running around on the floor, it was that distinct claws-on-cement sound dogs make. And then eventually it got so bad i was waking up multiple times a night to the feeling of something crawling into bed next to me and laying up against me. Id also have a reocurring nightmare of a black dog with six segments like a centipede talking to me. it became so frequent it didnt freak me out anymore lol.\n\nStill!! Its just sleep paralysis right?? Wrong. at one point the conversation came up about the history of the property, and according to moms bf a man had shot six of his dogs and then himself on the property. Thats not the vibe yall.\n\nMe and my mom discussed all of this and apparently she'd been seeing stuff in the house too. She always complained sounds would come from her room that we couldnt figure out the cause of. \n\nThe worst encounter was probably when we were sitting at the kitchen table and we heard rummaging through her closet (the closet shares a wall with the kitchen and the walls are thin). It definitely wasnt a small animal, it was like things were being picked up and moved. So naturally i get my scrawny ass in there armed with none other than a can of beans, and the second i announced i have a gun (can of beans) the sound stopped. \nThere was a box taken off the shelf and set on the floor. \n\nYou know how i said moms bf was a cool dude? Well he also started getting weird, his behavior kept escelating until eventually we learned he had been hiding cameras, tapping into all our phones and threatened to shoot us and we had to leave in the middle of the night. I havent gotten sleep paralysis since. \nDo what you will with that information!!",

I was on the 1st floor of the building and was facing North East. I dont have the exact direction but you can view it on ~~Google Map.~~\n\nI  saw a series of lights like a line of vehicle coming down the hill from  afar. A hill or a mountain. So far away and i just thought probably  some car going down. The incident occur at night but i do not recall  what time.\n\nThe next day, i notice  the sky and realised that the direction i was facing last night had no  mountain or hill. Did the alien removed a topography??? or there was no  hill or mountain there in the first place.\n\nI  do not recall the exact date because i can use the past date finder to  check the weather condition that night. Maybe i was tired from the  physical activity and seeing things??? It gives me shudder. Ever since  that incident. I should call it incident? I am being doubtful that i  question myself.\n\nI am sorry that  if my English is not good. English is not my spoken language. Trying to  explain the best i can or if someone else could.",

Beside the tv was a big and wide sliding door and I decided to look at the shadows of the leaves from the trees through the door. But one of the shadows suddenly caught my attention. I looked and I remember it looked like a puppet with a witch hat, and there was nothing attached to it like a stick or a hand to control it. It was moving around and looked like it was having some kind of conversation. I don’t remember what the other puppet shadow really looked like, but the two puppet shadows looked as if they were interacting with each other. I just sat there for a long time and just stared watching it. Then after a while my dad calls me and tells me to come and eat dinner and I try to tell him about the strange shadows at the door but he ignored it and didn’t even listen to what I was trying to say. And no one even saw what I saw. And when I went to the table to eat I saw them for the last few seconds and they just moved out of sight. I’ve never seen anything like that again but I would really like to know what it was, and I know it wasn’t a ghost or any spirit. Unfortunately I might not ever find out.",

        "text": "Here is my serious question..\nYou have hundreds of thousands of not millions of each… people who have passed away from sickness, disease, old age, accidents, murder, suicide…\nNo, I will not use the word “unalive” because it literally means the same thing and I do not understand the concept of sugarcoating something so serious when I have dealt with a close friend killing themselves before. It hurts and it sucks deeply!! So I am calling it for what it is. \n\nMy question is this… where do ghosts come from? (I have my theories) \n\nIf you believe in the Bible, there a couple of scriptures that lend credence to why a person might become a spirit banned from the afterlife. \n\nFor one, in the 10 Commandments, “thou shalt not kill…\n\nGenesis 1:26-28 announces that human beings are made in the image of God: \n\nExodus 20:7  “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain\n\n\nSo, if the Bible is correct and you murder someone, have an abortion, or kill yourself, are you banned from the afterlife?? \n\nIf we are created in the image of God and we destroy this image, are we banned to walk this planet eternally? \n\nI had what some might call an NDE a few years ago and I did not experience Heaven nor Hell, I experienced my spirit popping out of my body for a few minutes I suppose and staring at my physical body until I finally realized I was a ghost. \n\nThis was a very traumatic even that still plays on my almost three years later. \n\nSo why do some people die or have an NDE or try to commit suicide and experience a Heavenly astral plane while others experience nothing? \n\nMy friend who had an abortion in her late teens…. Has she banned herself from the afterlife even though she has since then raised three wonderful children? \n\nSo many questions that it feels like we have no real, definitive answers to. \n\nThanks for any input",

That would mean there are likely people on this thread that were ghosts at one point haunting a location or person, then eventually crossed over (shortly after death or many years or decades later).  \n\nHow odd is it realizing you could drive by one day the location you haunted for years, maybe some deja vu kicks in?  Does anyone on hear feel they could be a former ghost?",

I’ve been racking my brain for any potential paranormal experiences I may have had in the past. \n\nWhen I was a little kid maybe 5 or 6 I had a reoccurring dream about an old lady in my room. And it would usually go as follows: \n\nAn old woman, quite scraggly looking with grey stringy hair would enter my room and start tickling me but not in a fun way and it would freak me out a lot because when I woke up I could still feel a strong tickling sensation on my lower back that would take a least 10 min to go away after I would wake up. Some nights I actually ended up physically fighting her. One night I grabbed her and whacked her against my bed post “killing” her. And since then I’ve never seen her again. I’m not sure if there is a medical explanation for this or could it be paranormal? Maybe sleep paralysis? Also keep in mind I’ve never had a reoccurring dream since this happened. Any help in this arena would be greatly appreciated as I’m still quite new to this community.",

        "text": "It’s going to be a long story so get ready. \n\nI came to this house during the beginning of 2016. At first everything was fine and then months laters I felt like this house was weird. I was young so I couldn’t explain it but I was joking with my mom saying that my house was haunted. \n\nI always felt I was being watched by someone in my living room, my garage and my bed room. I does not feel safe anywhere except my mother’s bed room. \n\nMy first paranormal thing that happened is one day years ago (before covid, I think it was 2019 or 2018), it was late at night because I always go sleep late and I always take a shower before going to bed, and when I left the bathroom and I was going to climb the stairs (I also want to specify that the stairs have \"holes\" ie I can see below (I don't know what it's called) so I can see part of the stairs from below and a bit of my ground floor) and when I was about to take my first step to go upstairs I saw a man with a bit coat, a hat and a suitcase almost like if someone was going home after a long day of work. It was so realistic and the man was so chill that it was really scary. He walked the stairs below me and he was going to arrive to where was so I was so scared that I run to my bedroom. I never saw his face and never saw him again. Now I regret it because I would have wait to see his faces or anything else. But he was just so chill and it was almost like it was his house and he came back from work after a long day.\n\nAlmost feel like he didn't notice me and it was him coming back to his house after work. I heard people saying that if you see that men, it means someone is gonna die soon and my grand pa died months after this.\n\nI also have a hatch that is sealed on the floor above on the ground floor next to the bedrooms and in front of my attic, my mother has never had any info on that and why it is sealed. I will try to post a photo.\n\nI had also recently my door of my garage unlocked and opened when she is always locked. My mom thinks she forgot to lock it but trust me, she never does. \n\nDuring this summer, a lot of stings were found death in front of the bed of my mother in her bedroom. It was not just one, it happened a lot of times but then it stopped. She was never stung by one of them, she just woke up and every day for a couple of days she found death stings. Doors, windows were locked and no holes in the wall. \n\nThe people leaving in this house before were an old couple but none of them died there.\n\nI also remember to have a cold wind in my shower on my body with a shiver when my door and window were locked and it happened a couple times and then one recently. \n\nI also had a dream with my teddy bear and I think he is haunted. So in my dream, I was in an old house (it was my house that I shared with my mom and my sister) and we decided to pack stuff to throw away. We went to the attic with my mom and they were toys (old dolls (porcelain, mid 1900's) and teddy bears) and I said to my mom « We'll sort them out and throw them away » and I was looking to the left and I saw a teddy bear and his head is turning towards me, I was scared and then all the toys jumped on me and my mother and I wake up terrified.\n\nThat's not the only thing I wanna share. have the same teddy bear that I had in my dream in real life. I saw it months ago in a store and I really liked him so I decided to buy it online from the same company. But even if I find him really cute, I always had bad vibes since I had him.\nFirstly, when I was on my computer and he was on my bed I always felt like something was watching me (I never had that feeling before even with my other dolls (because I have also dolls)) and I couldn't sleep with him in my bed so I was so scared that days later receiving him, I put him in my attic. So it is related that I got attacked in an attic by the same teddy bear in my dream ? The same teddy bear is currently in my actual attic so it’s almost like it’s a meaning. \n\nAlso wanna mention that the house in my dream have two identical rooms of my real house. The ground floor and living room.\n\nIf someone can help me with this and have any advices or anything else, I will love to hear from you.",

We didnt get a chance to get in the house, as we heard sirens and it seemed like cops were coming from the right of the house we quickly sprinted down where we came from where the sirens just suddenly stopped?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third time was the time that actually made me think about this, we did some pretty illegal stuff that i wont get into because we're all going to court because of it currently, after we went in this time it seemed normal, whereas the other times was pure fear and paranoia this time it was calm, after we got out of the house we had this \"urge\" to do \"unlawful\" shit. That night we made a huge mistake (something involving vandalism, severe damage to property and not to the actual house itself) and it seemed like every time we went in there we almost always came out worse than the last time. Could this just be a coincidence or did i get cursed?",

        "text": "This is a simple story, but it’s 100% true, unembellished and happened to me. A few years ago, I was 30 years old and my grandmother had just died. My mother, aunt and I were staying in my grandmothers home in suburban Atlanta making funeral arrangements and caring for her home in the immediate aftermath of her death. It was the night after the day she died and we had all gone to bed. Each of us had our own bedrooms on the 2nd floor of the house. I was close to falling asleep when I distinctly heard two voices speaking. It sounded like two people talking downstairs. One voice was more easy to make out as a woman, the other I’m not sure. They were having a conversation at a normal volume, but I couldn’t make out anything that was being said, it was just murmuring. Strangely, I was not bothered by this at all. I was completely calm, mentally acknowledged it and then eventually fell asleep. The next morning I woke up and had forgotten all about it. Later that afternoon my mother, aunt and I were driving somewhere. We were all silent until all of a sudden, my very reserved, pragmatic aunt said only “I heard people talking in the house last night.” It was only then that I remembered. I told her that I had heard them too. My mother, whose bedroom was right next to mine, did not. We didn’t say much more about it. I think it made my aunt uncomfortable, and I didn’t want to press her right after her mom died. We never talked about it again, and my aunt herself died last year. I’ve thought about this occurrence more and more lately. Theres just no way it could’ve been actual people speaking. Her house was set back from the road up on a hill in a quiet neighborhood. The voices were a normal conversational volume could not have carried all the way from the street. What I really can’t understand is why I wasn’t scared when it happened. It’s so bizarre.\nAlso, if my aunt had not said anything I don’t think I would’ve even remembered. Even though now I can remember it so clearly. \nI’ve never had anything like that happen before or after.",

        "text": "My girlfriend had a grandmother who she was really close to her growing up. In 2014 she passed away from cancer and it took a large mental toll on my GF. Her grandmother was one of the main figures in her life providing wisdom, helping her out when she was stuck, and always looking over her to make sure she was okay.\n\nAs the years past my girlfriend said she could always sense her grandmother was still watching over her and would appear in dreams or manifest as a strong gut feeling. Having past experiences with the paranormal, I thought it was sweet and endearing her grandma was still watching over her in the afterlife. I didn’t think much more then that at the time.\n\nThe first real sign there was more to what she was feeling came in 2019. My girlfriend’s best friend and roommate at the time wanted to try Reiki (Japanese technique to reduce stress) together as they were both highly stressed trying to get jobs post graduation. During the process, my GF could sense her grandmother was in the room, but couldn’t see her. Later that night the roommate had a dream of an elderly woman saying a name.\n\nIn the morning, when she told my GF, there was silence as the woman’s description matched that of my GF’s grandma. This could have been chalked up to seeing an old photo of them together, which my GF had plenty of on her phone. The part that made indicated there was more afoot was the name. It was a nickname that the grandmother would call my GF when she visited. My GF never told anyone the nick name. That same day my GF got a phone call from a company that concluded with her getting her first job out of college.\n\nMy experience with her grandma came in 2021. It was a similar story as above where my GF was trying to acquire a position that would elevate her in her career. Her current company at the time did some major restructuring which resulted in poorer management and toxic work environments. She was praying and asking for something to show a sign that all her efforts to get out of the company and go someplace better were not for nought. She was on the hunt for the last six months and was about to give up. That night she withdrew her normal bubbly personality and was visibly upset. I told her that things do take time and the biggest piece was to keep pushing forward no matter how many hurtles are thrown your way. It did cheer her up, just in time to go to bed.\n\nIt should be noted at this point we live in a 2 bed room apartment on the third floor with large windows in the bed room that gets flooded with light from the city streets and surrounding buildings. There are curtains that are drawn across to prevent the light from getting in, but the occasional car headlight will peep through.\n\nAs we settled into bed, my mind was plagued with an all to familiar feeling I experienced once before when I chased down an old ghost story at an old tobacco barn in my home town. I couldn’t help shake the feeling that something was watching us. I first gazed over to the windows to make sure it wasn’t some person that was peaking through the gaps in the blind. It was when I scanned the room, that I noticed what appeared to be a shadow in the corner in front of the door. It was like a thick black mist with no identifying features that stood there like it was standing guard. I froze briefly before convincing myself that I must be dreaming and just laid back down.\n\nIn the morning, my girlfriend startled me awake by telling me she got a call from a large consulting firm looking to recruit her. She was so happy and couldn’t stop dancing. I was glad she got the new role that she was asking for, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what I saw right before I went to bed. I proceeded to inquire if she had any strange dreams last night to which she responded with a giddy yes. She proceeded to tell me it was about her grandma and her walking on a beach reminiscing about old stories and her grandma was parting advise to her about the future. At that point I told her what I saw and she told me “oh you saw her as well, I thought it was just my imagination”.  Now I know when ever my GF is stuck or having a hard time, expect a visit from grandma.",

This is pretty new to me, and it made me rethink something that happened to be a couple years ago. For a while I thought I was seeing a doppelgänger, but then I read more about what a doppelgänger truly is, and I don’t think that was what I was experiencing. So I have some questions for you all so I can try to clear up what was actually happening. I wonder now if what I was actually encountering was a mimic, but I still don’t know enough about them and their nature and motives. Here are my questions: \n\nDo mimics only appear in homes? \n\nCan they appear for reasons other than something sinister? \n\nIf their motive isn’t sinister, what would be some of the reasons one would show itself to you? \n\nDo mimics have any connection to parallel universes/alternate timelines? \n\nI would really appreciate your feedback! I had an experience several times a few years ago and just haven’t been able to come to a conclusion as to what exactly was going on. Trying to figure out what sub the experience might fit best in.

        "text": "This may be a bizarre coincidence or a cautionary tale about an improper way of smudging a home. If it was an improper smudging, please find a nice way to tell me I screwed up. \n\nFor two weeks, I'd been experiencing anomalous clicking sounds in my bedroom at night and was seeing a dark shadow. I eventually put some crystals in my bedroom and salt in the corners to ward it off. I also said the Lord's prayer before going to sleep. That night, I experienced no clicks and no shadows. The next morning, however, my daughter told me something was in *her* room that woke up the dog. She also saw a shadow. Okay, I screwed up and should have protected her room too. (Yes, I will always do this in the future.) \n\nThat morning, my daughter and I decide to smudge the house with sage. I ask anything that's negative or uninvited to leave out the open windows or open front door. I say the house is filled with love and light. I do this throughout the entire house. Afterward, I burn some rose incense.  \n\nSix hours later, a woman pounds on my front door, then opens the door and bursts into my house saying that my next door neighbor is trying to kill her. She's saying, \"He has a gun! He has a gun!\" I live on a quiet cul-de-sac with only 11 homes. Nothing weird ever happens here, and I've never seen this woman before. She's about 25 and is shaking uncontrollably. She can barely talk and runs into my kitchen and hides behind a wall. She asks to use my phone. I give her the phone and try to calm her down. Meanwhile, my husband calls the police. \n\nAs we wait for the police, she's still terrified and shaking, but she starts saying, \"Well, he didn't *really* threaten to kill me.\" She claims that sometime in the morning my neighbor stood over her and screamed at her. Later in the day she had a vision that my neighbor was going to kill her. Yes, a vision. That's why she ran out of the neighbor's house and into my home. She keeps repeating, \"My visions are never wrong!\" \n\nThe police arrive and tell us this woman is having a psychotic break. She tells the police she hasn't been getting more than two hours of sleep for several days. \n\nIt's the first time I've saged my house in over a year! I usually only sage the house to clean the energy when life gets stressful.  So was this a bizarre coincidence and just a random person having a psychotic break in my living room?! Or did I screw up during my house blessing and accidentally cause the thing in my house to go next door?!",

        "text": "So first of all this post is serious and not a joke I seriously need help. So I have been hearing things for a while, it first started when I shifted into my new house . First I will hear things like a train honking, which by the way there is no railway station near my house nor railway tracks. I told my family members but they said they did not hear it. I think this happened mostly when I was going to sleep. it happened like 9-10 times a month . I mostly ignored it . But I also started seeing things like in the first week of January 2023 . This one is pretty bad now, i am shaking while writing this. I was in my bed at night and I got up on my bed to go to the  bathroom while suddenly my door opened (it was like 12:30am I guess) i freaked out and jumped to my bed. I was thinking it was my sister who was sleeping in the other room. But there was no reason for her to come here, anyways because I was freaked out i covered myself with blankets and I didn't even saw who opened the door, then after like 10 to 15 minutes i hear that someone kicked the door and door opened with a creek sound, my heart beat raced because only my sister was in the other room sleeping and if she was entering the room quietly so that she doesn't awake anyone, why would she kick the door open. I was too scared to wake my mother and I wasn't even looking at this point and my eyes were closed acting like I was asleep, I was then relieving my mind that I was just hearing and seeing things , (keep in mind that I have spectacles of like -3.0 in both eyes and anything beyond 15cm is blurry) but after 15. Minutes the door closed with the handle sound and I am 100% percent sure i head that sound. I didn't tell anyone about this because they would just laugh it off. And if it was a theif then why didn't he steal anything , my house is not big like someone could hide here and there and then after this I started doing some experiments. I placed a dice on my study table and remembered the dice pattern, the way it was place and remembered the exact position where it was placed , I would check the dice here and there but the dice position changed after 1 to 2 days. I do not believe in ghost but at that night I was freaked out , but I still do not believe in ghost and I think I just forgot the dice pattern(the way it was placed.)\n\n\nAny help?",

Proceeds to tell me that the last 2 weeks she’s been seeing a grey cat walk past her/around the corners of our room/around the house. I freaked out because this week I’ve been seeing this grey cat as well. We do not own a gray cat; we do in fact have a white/orange cat. We discussed how we see the cat and we both never seen the face of the cat. Every time we see it they’re walking away or get a glimpse of their tail. Is there any possible explanation for this?",

        "text": "When I was growing up, especially when I started school at 6 years, I used to hear voices in my head. Everyone hears voices in their head but these ones were/are different because it felt like they were deeply connected to me/reality. They would tell me things, often telling me what would happen in the future. Things like, which guests I'll find when I get home after school, which person I know that has recently passed away, how certain events would change if I did some things etc. I can't remember others because there's a lot but I'm hoping to remember them as I type.\n\nI used to refer to these voices as angels or God Himself because the things they did to me were only good things and they seemed to want to protect me from everything. I remember this one time after school, a group of friends decided to grab some snacks at a nearby shop but I declined to go with them because this voice told me to go straight home after school and the same friends got robbed at that shop and one of them got stabbed in the chest, but everyone survived (thank God). Another time after school a street vendor was selling some flavored ice so I decided to buy one because it was very hot that day. However, the problem is, another voice warned me not to buy from him as something bad would happen. And it did. After I bought that ice, I forgot to give him the cash and I left, not necessarily running or anything, but it completely slipped my mind and he came after me. I was surprised why he was yelling at me because I thought everything had went well between us, and this guy pulled out a knife on me, but he didn't hurt me because I apologized profusely. I was super scared, disturbed because I was only 16 at the time and I'm relatively very small compared to my peers. I'm 22 now. \n\nThe voices kept telling me since I started hearing them when I was 6 that they'll stop talking to me once I told anyone, even my parents, that I was hearing them and that they also had enough energy to affect reality around me. \n\nSo when I was 16, after that street vendor scene, I got worried that I might be faced with something very dangerous that's trying to lure my soul into Hell, so I told my parents what had been happening to me all those years. Yes, the voices stopped revealing themselves to me but I can still feel the presence of these beings around me. They've never hurt me or anything, as it seems that their primary goal is to look after me.\n\nBy the way, my family has never been religious. Even to this day I don't know what these things are. Before 16, every time I'd ask them for identity, they never really gave me a clear answer. \n\nMay someone with an answer please enlighten me.",

I'm an architecture student, and I study environmental psychology. \n\nI used to be afraid of going to its second floor on my own. In it is a hallway, the length of three bedrooms, leading to the bathroom. No one uses these bedrooms because my brother and I slept in the master's bedroom with my mom. You can imagine the acoustics of this thing because of all the concrete and the empty spaces in between. Every new year, you could not hear a single firework when you're inside that bathroom. The further you go in, the darker and the quiter it gets. There are no lights in this hallway. You would have to open the door of each bedroom to turn the lights on. I would always anticipate the possibility that something might chase me as soon as I turn on those lights. That never happened.\n\nI was 15 and I was getting ready for school. I was brushing my teeth until I heard something whisper in my ear. I felt it, but I did not understand what it said. I just ran downstairs where the rest of my family were. I told my mom what happened and she believed me. She told be that she's been hearing whispers by the hallway.\n\nA year later, my brother and I had to live in the big city for school so we rented out the house for a family of four: a mom, a dad, a teenage girl, and a little boy. The little boy would have constant headaches and nightmares, he would bang his head against the wall. None of them use the bathroom by the hallway. Instead, they would use the bathroom on the ground floor. They lasted about a month before deciding to move out.\n\nThankfully, we were able to sell the house to a newly wed couple. Bless them. And my family now lives in an apartment in the city, because wa all know that apartment life is never haunted.\n\nI would like to visit more haunted locations to study the possible reasons for paranoia through architectural planning and design.",

I tend to rationalize it as my aircon causing textures to expand which creates the noises but how would everything make a noise. that's all that happens though. I use to sleep in another room and my closet in that room would do it.  but now im in this other room and its everything. Am I tripping ? im the only one in the house who experiences these things. nothing bad has ever happened tho, is there a spirit just living in my room with me ?. this only happens at night btw and only when im alone.",

I left the kitchen to go retrieve something from my closet. When returning to the kitchen my daughters were still playing at the bar. Adjacent to the bar is a paper shredder. The paper shredder has a switch on the top of it that you have to click three notched to the right to turn on. I was cutting around the bar to go to the refrigerator which is about eight feet to the left of the paper shredder. Before I could get to the refrigerator the paper shredder cuts on and starts whirring as it does when it is running. My daughters started to giggle because they thought it sounded funny. I walked over to the paper shredder and cut it off. This is not the first time an occurrence like this has happened in my house that I am currently living in. This house has seen a lot of trauma and has had questionable characters in it throughout the years. I have also spent years working in the ICU at nights and have witnessed many brutal deaths, especially during the pandemic. Often times I wonder if a bad spirit has followed me home from the ICU or if someone who has come into my house at one time or another has transferred a negative entity into my house. Either way this is not the first time this kind of stuff has happened in my house. It is to the point where I just shrug it off and have become unfazed when it does happen.",

Luckily, after a lifetime of these spiritual/“ghostly” experiences, this doesn’t bother me (3/4 siblings think I’m insane for this, but I’m also training to be a desairologist, so.)\n\nLast night I was laying in my bed, in the dark, watching TV on low volume.

I flicked on my bedside lamp and saw my cat, now wide awake, and staring at the door. It was almost midnight, and I know my brother would rather die than walk up to my room on the second floor at any time of day. So I kind of had an inkling of what I was going to find when I opened the door. \n\nNothing. The whole house was dark and quiet. Text my sister who was awake with her baby and her immediate reply was “ABSOLUTELY NOT.”\n\nNot that it’s super specific, but it was a little funny to remember later that the night my mom died, I was asleep with my phone on silent, so one of my other brothers had to drive to my house across town to tell me at 2 am. He let himself into my house and like thee neanderthal he is, banged on my bedroom door three times. \n\nI’ll never forget the sound of those knocks, so specific in such a time of tragedy.

        "text": "A month ago, I had to deal with probably the hardest passing I have had to deal with up to this point in my life. My once best friend and ex-fiance overdosed on fentanyl and passed. We broke up a little over 5 years ago due to his addiction (I am not one who ever has or ever will use drugs but sadly he fell down that path). We did not end things on a bad note, however, after years and years (6 years to be exact) of attempting to help him get over his addiction (including but not limited to rehabs, clinics, therapists, support groups, etc) I could not take it anymore. I could not stand the lies. I could not stand the bullshit. Most of all, I could not stand watching him kill himself. It was his addiction that really helped me understand the famous saying \"If you truly love someone, sometimes you have to let them go\". That is exactly what happened. I was afraid I was enabling him by saying if things don't change, I have to end things and not acting on it.   \n\n\n**A little background:**  \nRight before we broke up, I gave him an ultimatum, which was either make a real effort to change by leaving his triggers behind and work towards bettering himself emotionally, mentally, physically, and professionally (which I will support) or respect that this not the life I want and it is time that we end things.  \n\n\nHe gave me the most honest answer any addict could give which was \"I want to change, but I can't promise you I can, and I understand where you are coming from and will respect your wishes\". As hard as it was to end things, we did. At this time, I was living 100 miles away from him because I was in college and though he had a lot of his property in my apartment, he stayed with his parents because he had a bar job there (which really was where he would get drugs). He drove down to have this conversation but it was after midnight when he arrived. I asked him to take his cat home, gave him my ring, and said I would pack his stuff and arrange from him to come pick it up. He agreed. We cuddled for about 30 minutes, talked a bit, he then grabbed his cat and left. One of the last things I told him before he left was to never let me get the call that he died, he laughed and told me that would never happen.  \n\n\nAfter that, I never saw him again. His mom called me a few days later and said he went to inpatient and would be coming down to grab his stuff when I was ready for her and his dad to do so. His family and I got along wonderfully (and we still do), so I was happy to have them come down and we arranged for it to happen. As I was loading their truck, his mom and I were talking and she thanked me for everything as well as reiterated that she did not blame me one bit for leaving. She prayed that he would get clean and live a full life, to which I agreed. I told her I don't ever want to get back with him, but I want to see him live and happy full life and hope that we can be best friends again one day.\n\nWe both moved on, I met an incredible man at school, who I am still with today. He met another sweet woman whom he had a kid with. Sadly they did not work out, however, he dated multiple sweet ladies, including the lady he was with when he passed.   \n\n\nI would periodically get texts from him, and though I would reply, I was definitely not the talker between the two of us because I never wanted to give him false hope that we would get back together, and I would hear through the grapevine periodically that he was still using (which his pictures on social media supported because I could see it in his face).   \n\n\n**This is where things got weird:**\n\nOn December 16, I got the call I always feared. Our friend from Hawaii (where we lived for 4 of the 6 years we were together) called me to tell me he overdosed and was in a coma (what was crazy was that I turned off my Facebook messenger notices a few weeks earlier because I was getting so many notifications yet before this call came in his brother and sister-in-law tried to message me on there). I of course lost it. Our friend said he was flying out to stay with his family and go see him so I told him we will talk when he gets here.  \n\n\nThe next day, our Hawaii friend texted me and said his mom said there was no sign of brain activity but they had more tests to run. It was this night when things started to get weird. I woke up around 2:30 AM from a dead sleep and I felt him leave. It was a feeling I never felt before, and I knew right there and then he was gone. I knew he was not coming back.   \n\n\nThe next day, I called a few other people who we knew in Hawaii that did not know what had happened to tell them he was in a coma and we were not sure if he was going to make it. As I was talking to one of these guys, I suddenly felt that I was about to get that call that he was officially dead. Within 2-3 minutes, I had another call come in, it was his brother-in-law. I answered and said \"is this that call?\" and he mumbled through his tears, \"yea, I am so sorry\". I said \"Okay, thank you, I love you bro\" he told me he loved me too and we hung up.  \n\n\nThat night I woke up at 3:30 AM from a dead sleep and heard his laugh clear as day in the living room (he had a very unique laugh that I could recognize).  I could not go back to sleep. I was in tears, I knew he was there.   \n\n\nLater that day, my boyfriend and I started to pack for a trip we were getting ready to go on the following week for Christmas. My boyfriend had his Spotify on, and it eventually started to play random songs that were similar to his playlist. 3 of my favorite songs that my ex would play (he was a musician) came on in a row. It tripped me out so much that I went and restarted the playlist midway through the 3rd song.  \n\n\nThe next day, I went to the store to grab a couple of last-minute gifts and toiletries for our trip. As I was in the store, the same 3 songs that were played the day before in the same order started to play. When the third song came on, I dropped my items and left.  \n\n\nThat night, I woke up from a dead sleep at 3:30 AM but this time is was because I felt someone sit on the end of the bed. I knew he was there.   \n\n\nThe next day, my boyfriend and I flew out for our holiday trip. We landed in Vegas because it was the closest airport to our destination. I had never been to Vegas, so we toured the strip before departing to our destination. I was having so much fun, then guess what starts playing in one of the casinos THE SAME 3 SONGS IN THE SAME ORDER! I was completely freaked out. I could not believe it.   \n\n\nThings settled for about a week, with the exception of waking up EVERY night at 3:30 AM precisely. This time though I would not hear, sense, or see anything, I would just wake up.   \n\n\nThe day we were getting ready to head home, my boyfriend's brother was driving us to the airport, and guess what comes on the radio... THE SAME THREE SONGS IN THE SAME FREAKEN ORDER! By this point, I already accepted it was him.  \n\n\nHis funeral was the day after we got home. Which I went to. His family was happy to see me, our friend from Hawaii was happy I was there, and many of our mutual friends were there and were very happy to see me. All and all, I was glad I went, but it was hard.  \n\n\nI had a couple of nights where I slept through the night, then he started to appear in my dreams. The first few I shrugged off as my grief. The third time he appeared in my dream, I could not dismiss it as grief. He kept telling me that I need to try Hard Cider with Whiskey as we sat in a recording studio with two of our other friends who passed years prior, I kept trying to tell a group outside of the room something through a loudspeaker something but kept getting interrupted by my ex and our other deceased friends. When I woke up, I could not stop thinking about the drink. I reached out to my friend from Hawaii who was staying on his family's farm later in the day and asked him without any context \"do you all have a thing with hard cider with whiskey?\". He laughed and was like \"ya bro, why?\". This was not a thing I knew about, and it was definitely not a thing when me and my ex were together. So I was mind fucked, but was like \"okay\".  \n\n\nAfter this, I started to wake up every night at 3:30 AM until LAST NIGHT.  \n\n\nLast night, I had the craziest dream of them all. My ex and I were in this random hotel room in Vegas talking. He then started to ask about my current boyfriend, but not in a way that was uncomfortable, more like he wanted to know more. I told him how happy he and I were and that I think we were the best thing that ever happened to each other. He smiled and told me he was happy for me, and that all he wanted was for me to be happy. He asked me if I would lay down and cuddle with him though. I said I would but nothing sexual because it was not fair to my boyfriend. He said okay. We did. He whispered in my ear and told me that he will always love me, always be happy, never give up, and to change the world. Then I woke up.  \n\n\nToday has been rather crazy. I have been presented with three incredible opportunities out of the blue (one academic and two professional) all of which I am considering and taking the next steps to apply for and all of which would allow me to build on my life-saving research project. In addition, I got a random message on LinkedIn from someone asking me if my current employer is hiring, which I verified they are.   \n\n\nI cannot say that this was him or if it was all in my head. But somehow I feel a sense of peace. I know that he always cared for me, and I always cared for him, but we were on two different paths in this world. I don't feel scared, and I no longer feel alone. I have my best friend back, I have part of my old group back, they are just spirits, which I am totally okay with (and in some ways almost happier about because they are always there).  \n\n\nI know some may dismiss this, but maybe my story will bring a sense of peace to others. Death is not the end, it is just another form of life. I do not understand it, but I do not fear it. All I know is that having my spirit homies is badass and though it sucks that they died, I am glad they are around me.",

        "text": "So my son is 8 and has been seeing these energy shadow beings. He called them demons at first bc they were ugly, no one looking exactly the same. But they are not harming him more so helping him. He says they watch him when he sleeps, two in the same place every night. He explains them as having a cold rush of air when they pass by him and when many are around it makes the room very cold. He will have constant vivid dreams where they communicate with him, not with words they make a noise he said that sounds like when you spin a stick fast in the air, sometimes they whisper. His dreams often have pyramids, the moon and the all seeing eye in them. This experience of his seems to be getting stronger and stronger and sometimes they lead him place’s particularly to dark or shady places as they do not like bright lights (most of them) and are very active at night. The thing is he is blind and when he feels their energy he can focus and tell what they look like in his head. These beings do not like bad energy they hate his brother who yells and is aggressive also as also is his dad often. Most of them leave if you yell or are mean. He’s started to place crystals around the house and they are attracted to them he says it keeps them from following him which he does not like sometimes esp when this one in particular stares at him at night. A few years ago he was in a freak shooting and actually got shot through the head, I think these things protected him through this situation as he should had does but only when blind. Which is prob why is 3rd eye is so strong. Although it had been his whole life. He’s a very special kid and won’t talk to anyone about these experiences bc he know ppl will think he’s crazy. I have many videos of him speaking in great detail about them. Anyone had anything similar happen to them or have any info on this type of thing or what to do with it?\nThanks!",

I spent alot of time with my friends driving around at night. One night my friend A was driving me home, we were having a good time listening to music and talking. My house was in this neighborhood that was literally a full “rectangle” so in order to get to my house you would just take a right, left, left, and boom my house would be in the middle to the left. \n\nSo my friend is driving and she takes a right, and at the very end of the street was this tall, lanky, gray, hunched over creature, but its running. While its running it turns left down the next street. At this point A and i look at eacher and ask eachother what the hell that was, but she continues to drive. She took the next left and we see it again but further now taking another left towards my house. We both begain to flip out not knowing what it was, creeped out, but also curious. \n\nAs we make the final left turn towards my house it was no longer there. We took a couple laps around my block to see if we could find it again but nothing and nobody was there. \n\nIve heard of skinwalkers looking like that but it also looked like the werewolf from harry potter with the way it ran, still creeps me out to this day. Does anyone know what it could have been or has seen something similar?",

        "text": "So I was at work doing a late evening probably around 7pm and I started to smell smoke. Now I work on a till and the computer tower that runs it is in a cupboard underneath. Presuming it was the box of toll roll either getting hot or beginning to burn I opened the cupboard and moved the box (that wasn’t warm) away from the tower about 6 inches. After 15 minutes the smell was still there and I was a little confused in all honesty. My intention was to tell my manager the next time I saw them as they was no smoke anywhere or any signs of fire. It’s also worth mentioning that none of the fire alarms were going off either. Anyway, my manager comes walking down to where I am and before I can say anything begins asking if I smell burning. I tell her I’ve smelt it the last fifteen minutes and even moved the till rolls. At this even more colleges walk down to me saying they’ve smelt it in the rest of the store. Now just to note this building isn’t small. Probably 150ft by 150ft so more of a big warehouse. For about another 15 minutes we all go around smelling everything and everywhere. Even in the cash office behind a big armoured metal door you could smell smoke which made no sense. At this point customers begin to say they can smell it too so we seriously considered evacuating. We gave the alarms a check and nowhere registered smoke (note each portion of the store is split into sections). At this we decided there was no need and were all very confused to say the least. For about another five minutes (a total of thirty five minutes now) we all smelt it still with some people saying it was gone in a certain area. When I went over it was gone, then when I came back it was still there where I originally was. Overall this was a very strange experience for everyone. \n\nIt’s also worth noting I know full well the building is haunted as I’ve heard other things such as footsteps in the stock room when I know nobody is there and I have gone to check. Tape that I have just placed down has flown off the desk I’ve been stood near. Also 2 other employees 1 of which is still there has seen 2 full bodied apparitions both at the same time and cold be seen looking in the same direction on camera even when there was nothing there. They said they had seen a little girl and a woman in black coincidentally right where the tape came off of the desk I work at. \n\nI mainly just wanted to know what smelling smoke means and if it’s good or bad?",

They are Dominican and we live in a German speaking country.\n\nHe started having physical pain in his chest, wrist, his neck and the back of his knees.. his best friend died in a tragic carcrash a few years ago and ever since his death, my boyfried gets rashes in those exact areas.. so there seems to be a connection there. When his pain started, after a while he realised he had this experience with intense pain in those areas, once a year, ever since his friend died. Always at the end of January.. and it stops after he visits his grave. \nAfter a while he started struggling really badly and said he was feeling all sorts of emotion and that they weren't his emotions though. He even cried and he never cries.. my boyfriend couldn't remember a lot of the evening and what was said. He said it felt like a dream from the time we ate dinner to the time he had a shower, it's all very blurry to him. When he was out of it he said he missed his mom.. right after he said that he snapped out of it and said, when l'm crying, it's not me. What did l just say, when l was lying there? And l told him about the mother thing, because he couldn't remember it, even though it was less than a minute ago. \nAnother time he said, he wanted a cigarette, he just wanted to smoke. I gave him a cigarette but he couldn't light it, he said the light of the fire was too bright for him. When l lit the cigarette for him, he seemed satisfied and exclaimed, when have l smoked the last time? In a scence of it's been ages.. and said thank you for letting me smoke.. (my boyfriend has been smoking all day) he kept repeating that it was too bright in our room, even to it was rather dark. There was a green light on and some coloured bulb lights.. it was really dark actually. \nWhich leeds me to believe that wherever his friend is stuck, it's really dark there and he's not used to light anymore.. \nEverytime my boyfriend snapped back, he said he thinks his friend is hurting, feeling alone, he wants to talk to me and that he really misses his mother but is also a bit mad, because his family doesn't upkeep his grave.. \n\ndid l really speak with him when my boyfriend was out?

Horror story in itself.  Anyway we spent a lot of time in a few different hotels recently.\n\nI realized that I cannot sleep there.  It’s not that anything particularly creepy or sinister happens in the hotel itself but my dreams were so weird.  I saw many different people in my sleep and woke up feeling completely drained.  I felt like I had been talking on the phone all night or something but I don’t remember the dialogue.\n\nOne place in particular there was just a man sitting and watching me the whole night.  He was middle aged and in a blue shirt.  Reddish hair.  Not super creepy but he was just there.  This is a dream, yes.. but it was -all night.-  I’m prone to weird and vivid dreams but the way they seem to manifest in the hotels are so crazy and different.  I understand that stress is a factor for poor sleep and I know sleeping in hotels isn’t comfortable because it’s not home.  I just find the way they manifest very peculiar.\n\nAnyway I was talking to my husband about this man in the dream and I remembered back when I was 19 sleeping in an old hotel in New Orleans.  I dreamed I woke up in the room (I think it was a dream at least but def was one of those dreams where you feel awake).  I was surrounded by these black demonic looking faces but also kind of human.  Ghoulish may be a better word and they were all screaming so loudly.  Like they were yelling at me.  I had completely forgotten about it until recently but it was one of the scariest nightmares I ever had.  It was 15 years ago and still clear.\n\nThat hotel was hundreds of years old and we all know the history of New Orleans.  \n\nI just wonder- is it the stress of sleeping in hotels or are we picking up on the crazy energy of the thousands of people that move through them all the time? Anyone else share these kinds of experiences?",

        "text": "On New Year’s Eve my friends and I were drinking on my friend’s land. We all got a little tipsy some even drunk. However one of my friends wanted to go inside. After she left one of the guys went with her. We laughed until we got too cold to be outside since the fire had gone out completely. However this is when it got weird. No one remembers going inside. No one remembers how we got onto the topic of creatures. However my friend who went in first was having a chat with my other friend. No one remembers what was happening or even said. \n\nHowever the one who went in first (going to call her Raven and the second friend Sara) her eyes seemed dark as the conversation went on. Sara’s boyfriend seemed to become protective of Sara, but Raven looked at him and smiled and told him not to worry. This instantly put him at ease, but when it’s comes to Sara nothing relaxes him until Sara tells him to relax.\n\nThe only part that most of us remember is when Sara asks Raven “But who am I?” Raven didn’t think and just spoke “You’re a dreamer, but…” we wanted to know why she stopped but that’s when the air was suffocating. It was almost hard to breath. Sara seemed to be fine because that’s when she asked “but what?” Raven shook her head and said “nothing” she then looks at each of us and says “I’m tired, we are going to sleep now.” \n\nNo one moved, the guy who went in after her was sitting behind her. He was gonna stay the night because of her, but when she said We. Everyone knew it wasn’t about him. \n\nWhen no one moves her tone becomes more chilling and demanding “Go home. We are going to sleep.” We all said our goodbyes and left, but the second we hit the air, we could all breath again. After we left I remember everything I did and so does everyone else who wasn’t drunk. \n\nWe talked about it in the morning and Raven seemed to be the most worried about Sara. Raven went on about how that was her, but wasn’t really her. She talked about how she got annoyed when Sara asked what Raven thought of her but she couldn’t tell Sara why. We tried to press for more answers for our questions, but Raven simply changed the subject about other paranormal things. \n\nWe all felt at ease as the day went on, but Raven seemed bothered. We haven’t brought it back up since no one remembers anything at all and it stresses us out that an hour of our lives is gone.",

        "text": "I know this is a paranormal community, so I shouldn't even really be worried about sounding crazy, but I really hope that I don't. I am going to start off with a little bit of my background first in order for everyone to see the full picture, so if this gets a little droning, I apologize in advance.\n\nWhen I was 8 years old, my mother and stepfather decided that we were going to move to northern Arkansas for them to have better job opportunities. It just so happened that they chose to buy a house that was about an acre away through open fields from a late 1800's to early 1900's cemetery. There was an old abandoned hand-built church that stood on the property that was no longer in use that me and some of the neighborhood kids used to go and play in. Nothing unusual had ever happened or given me the spooks until my 9th birthday. My mom made me invite all of the girls in my class at school to my sleepover party and after we were done doing presents and everything she told all of us to go outside and play, so the first thing I wanted to do was take all of my friends over to this church house to show them around. One of the girls that was sort of a loner anyway left the group and went weaseling through the actual cemetery, which was something that my mom had told me to never do, so the girl and I wound up getting into an argument and she decided to go stomping on the graves and being disrespectful to the dead. I went and tattled, of course, so my mom made us come inside since it was getting close to dark outside anyway. \n\nWe all got ready for bed and were getting settled down in my bedroom when all of a sudden the door slammed shut by itself, which freaked all of us out and made us all scream a little, so my mom came barging through the door to see what happened and told us all to just calm down, blamed it on the air conditioning, and said we needed to get laid down. After a few moments of her walking away, we all got nestled in, but hadn't turned the lights off yet, when the door slammed shut by itself again and then started rattling/vibrating on its hinges. My mom came bursting through again to see which one of us was causing the ruckus, but we all told her what had happened again and she still didn't believe us, so she shut off the light and left the door open. Mind you, I was deathly afraid of the dark and since the other girls were there and couldn't sleep with nightlights, my mom wouldn't let me use mine; so when the door slammed shut a third time and the room was completely dark, I absolutely went berserk with sobs and panic. At that point, my mom was getting downright pissed off because she thought that it was us. She opened the door, pulled me out of the bed, told the other girls they had better get quiet before she had to start calling parents, and she made me go sleep on the couch in the pitch black while I cried into my pillow where nobody could hear me (I had gotten used to doing this since my mom always treated my night terrors with little to no empathy). \n\nNext thing I knew, I felt something pull my covers down a little, so I got stiff as a board and peeped my head up just in time to see this black, hairy-looking, fog thing slithering back down the couch toward another bigger black, hairy-looking, fog thing it was connected to that was resting on top of the entertainment center. I was frozen in shock at this point and I couldn't make a sound until this thing had gotten halfway across the living room and was almost to the couch, then I finally let out a blood curdling screech. My stepdad finally came in this time and when he flipped on the lights, the fog thing totally vanished. I was hyperventilating and shit, so he told me to come get in bed with them. I finally got calmed down, went to sleep and everything was fine for the rest of the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to the next night, everyone had gone home and it was back to my normal routine so I could get ready for school the next day. When I laid down, I felt like something was watching me so I insisted that my mom let me use my nightlight, but she wouldn't budge on the issue and finally agreed to leave the hallway light on with my door cracked instead. I did my little whimpering shit like usual, until I was finally drifting off and saw this fog thing coming towards me again, but I was too tired to wake myself back up. The dream that I had that night was one of the scariest things I've ever dreamed of in my life and it became a recurring dream for the next couple of months. I always woke up in a sweat and jolting myself up from my bed to run to my parents room. (If anyone wants to know the dream, I will share, but I'm trying to keep this as short as possible so far.) One night where the dream finally ended with me being ripped to shreds by these three little demon looking things, which hadn't happened any of the other nights, I never had that dream again, but I also have only had a handful of dreams ever since. It's like my mind decided to shut itself off from the traumatic experiences the dreams were giving me. That, or the entity decided to start hijacking my dreams from me, I'm not really sure. Needless to say, this attachment has been with me ever since, you guys. \n\nMy belongings apport and reappear in the most random obvious places (specifically keys - not just mine but people that visit as well), there's always weird noises in every house that I move to, people that I live with have witnessed it, I've gotten pictures of it (it looks like the chancellor from Star Wars and resembles a grim reaper), it throws things sometimes when it wants my attention, and it gets stronger the longer I live in one place (like if I move to a new house it weakens the entity for a while but it always manages to gain strength as it gets comfortable). It's never really done anything to harm me or anyone else per se, but it's always lurking, makes its existence very known, and gives everyone in my house the creeps. I've tried doing cleansing and prayers and all the spiritualistic stuff that most people advise, but those things don't even phase it in the slightest. \n\nWhat's even weirder is the fact that when I get upset or angry, things fall off of shelves or even fly towards me sometimes (almost like Matilda in a way) and I've even blown lights out just by touching the switch when I'm in these kinds of moods. My hair constantly stays full of static (which might not mean anything, but I find it weird that I stay so electrically charged), so much so that I literally have to use spray that you iron your clothes with to keep my hair from sticking to my face. Plus, orbs are starting to make themselves visible on a regular basis inside my home and more so all over my property, along with shadow people as well. \n\nCould it be possible that I have some kind of psychical energy or ability that I have blocked off since childhood that has now made itself into its own independent being? Or did I manifest it by suppressing my fears or something? The spiritual energy on my property is so intense, I literally don't know how to explain it to people without sounding like I've lost all of my marbles. I've done plenty of my own fair share of research into possibilities throughout the years, but have come up emptyhanded every single time. If I have some kind of ability, then I need to learn how to control it or something, because its getting out of control at this point. If anyone has any kind of information or insight, it would be so appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S. I'm sorry that this post was so longwinded! If you made it to the end with me, you're a real trooper and I'm forever grateful for you taking the time to read it! I'm just so tired of trying to figure this crap out on my own!)",

        "text": "I have had quite a few \"paranormal\"(?) experiences as a kid up until now (23).\n\nWhen I was around 4-5 years old I was in my room reading a book in front of one of those huge box tvs. To map it out, the tv was on a stand and it was pushed back all the way against the wall (as my parents recall because it is hazardous for a giant tv to be hanging off the edge) and I was laying down parallel to the shelf maybe like a foot away from the stand. I heard a loud banging sound on the wall from the hallway and next thing I knew there was a giant tv twice the size of a 5 y/o on top of me. A core memory i would say. Like I mentioned, the tv was up against the wall so it had no reason to just slide off and the fact that it fell after a loud bang, coincidence? I THINK NOT! Good thing (and strange thing) is though, I didnt have a single scratch or bruise on me after.\n\nThat happened in the first house (that i have memory of) i lived in and have not (or dont remember) anything else happening but I just know I had a lot of nightmares. \n\nThen when I was around 7, my dad who worked at a church was staying late to clean and I was with him. I never really liked this church, the people for one, and just the building always gave me the creeps. So as he was going through the building he would shut the lights off one by one after he finished an area. The first floor hallway and lobby(?) area was what he had just finished. I was in the kids room in said hallway and when he finished he had asked me to come out and wait by the front door because he was almost done. I walked out and the hallway was super dark but flushed with red from the exit sign at the end of the hallway. At the end of that hallway had a stairwell that led to the second floor and a door to the outside but nobody really used that one because it was always dark (no switch) and used as a storage area. So I left the room and looked around the hallway to see where my dad was but didn't see him so I turned off the rooms lights and started walking down the hallway to the lobby. I found my dad and he asked me if I had everything and I nodded but looked down the hallway thinking if I had left anything in the room, but mid thought my eyes caught something. At the end of the hallway, the reddest point, a black mass formed from the door and floated up the stairs. I froze in place, it was so clear. I can still picture it to this day. The top looked like the body of a man in a black trench coat, and I only say top because there was no bottom. Where the coat would end his/its body ended. Needless to say I never looked down that hallway again and shortly after my parents moved churches so it worked out. Church wise.\n\nNow I'm 12, in a new apartment with my parents and a brother (2 at this time). we lived there for around 5 years and those five years were hell. My family was in a bad place (this is where the title comes in). I have had a sprinkle of experiences here and there leading up to here but these years were the worst. My brother now tells me about how he really didnt feel safe in that apartment either. A day didn't go by where somebody wasnt yelling at somebody. Everybody was stressed and unhappy all the time. My brother still being a baby/toddler made the days a little brighter by just being around, but that didnt stop him from getting the bad end of the stick at times. It was just a bad place. With the apartment being cramped on its own, and the amount of negativity everybody was emitting did not help. \n\nI first started to notice it when every other day from the floor above my room I would hear somebody in heels walk into the room and walk over to where the window was and pause, then drop what sounded like a pearl necklace and the pearls scattering, then them walking back out the room. I didn't think much of it at first, just wondered what job they had that they get to wear heels everyday and if there was another reason for the pearls falling the floor. But it started to feel off to me once I realized there was a pattern to it. Every other day for the five years i lived there, a person in heels takes five steps to get to the window, theres silence, the pearls drop and scatter, another five steps out the door, the door never shut. I know this could be a person just having a very strict routine and the pearls could be something else, but also reading and hearing about how ghosts can relive specific moments of their lives also got me thinking. \n\nAlso in this apartment, I always had nightmares. Not a single regular dream, either no dream or a bad dream. Now this might not seem like much, but its the fact that after we moved out of that apartment and got our current house, I didn't have nightmares for a while and if I did they were not frequent. These nightmare most of the time took place in that apartment and were also continuations. Not really reoccurring though, I have had some of those. But, because of them I hated sleeping.\n\nOne more moment that sticks out more from other happenings was when I opened my eyes to a face right above me. I never suffered from sleep paralysis, thankfully, and this wasnt a sleep paralysis moment either. I was just laying in bed trying to fall asleep but for some reason, it felt like something was trying to pry my eyes open. I few years back I had watched something where a girl was talking about how people have warned her that if you feel like something it trying to open your eyes, dont give in and she passed on that warning. So this whole time thats all I could think of. I really did try with all my might to not open my eyes, even turned around in bed to see if moving around would stop it. It didnt.I eventually ended up on my back and thats when it got too much, my eyes were so irritated that i gave in and opened them. When my eyes shot open, a pale, elongated face with sunken black eyes and a gapping mouth stared at me inches from my face. I tried to close my eyes again but i just laid there frozen (this wasnt sleep paralysis coz i couldve moved if i wanted to i was just in shock) for a second before I quickly sat up and the face faded away. I slept with the lights on for a week. \n\nStuff like this hadnt happened to me since we moved out. I have heard things at times, but are easy to chalk it up to something else, but the things that happened in that apartment when my family was down under the rocks, made me realize that they really do feed off our bad energy.\n\nfurthering that point, I posted something on this sub a while back about my college experience and how while my roommates or I were in a bad spot, a lot weird unexplainable things happened. \n\nIt like a reward to them.",

        "text": "\nI was reading some true stories on this sub and I remembered that i never shared this one. \n\nIt’s not super elaborate or flashy, but it actually happened, i’d love to hear your thoughts about it.\n\nAbout a decade back i used to work at a brewery/pub. It was set in a pretty big and old building, from the early 1900’s. \n\nI worked there for a couple of years, and most of the time the it was pretty chill, but backbreaking at times. On my time working there i had two experiences that i can only describe as supernatural.\n\nThe first one, it was a particular late night and i was task with closing up the hangar/loading docks. Closing it up was making sure there wasn’t anything obstructing where the trucks would park, stacking up any loose crates, turning the lights off and locking it all up. \n\nI was about done, so i turn of the lights and as i’m making my way to the door a beer bottle comes rolling towards me from the dark between the tall stacks of crates. It wasn’t forceful or anything, it looked like someone gently placed it on the floor and rolled it towards me. \n\nI didn’t thought too much of it, so i picked up the bottle and placed it inside a half empty crate. I turned around and as i started walking another bottle comes rolling from the same place, than another one. Tired and thinking it was a coworker trying to fuck with me i shout “Hey, alright, you got me. Come on i gotta close it up” I expected to hear laughter or something, but instead i was dead silent. \n\nI waited for a couple minutes, turned on my flashlight and started looking around the stacks of crates for what I thought it would be a giggling coworker. After searching each corner and turn i gave up. I was a little weirded out at this point, but i just picked up the two bottles from the ground and placed in the same crate as the first one.\n\nI turned off my flashlight and shouted at the darkness “Alright, I’m locking up. See you tomorrow” just as a finished saying that a crate full of bottles fell from one on the stacks and landed two feet from me, glass shards and beer exploding everywhere.\n\nThe next day i told my boss about it and he said it was probably a rat. The thing is, those crates when full probably weights 20 pounds, how could a rat push it? \nTalking to my coworkers they told me that they’ve also experienced weird stuff during closing hours.\n\nMy second experience happened again when i was closing the place. This time i was closing the pub.\n\nWhen closing the pub the last thing you usually do is restock the walk-in freezer. The freezer is probably just as old as the building itself and it sits underground, right beneath the bar. \n\nI was down there filling that enormous thing with kegs and crates. Being a very old freezer from a time when safety wasn’t a big concern the thing doesn’t open from the inside, no handle, nothing. Just a flat, plain steel door.\n\nSo i did what I always did when i had to go inside that thing, i put a keg securing the door open. I was halfway through the task when i hear the door slamming shut, i rush towards the door but it’s locked shut. I started pounding on it, but the only other person there was my boss in the office, two floors above me, probably with his door closed. I tried my phone, but since I’m locked underground inside a steel and led box i had no service.\n\nI was wearing only jeans ans a T-shirt so things were getting chilly pretty quickly, my face was going numb and my hands were getting stiff, i made a blanket out of cardboard but it was doing very little keeping the cold at bay. \n\nThe only reason I didn’t freeze to death was because i had a date with a regular and she went there looking for me. She asked my boss where i was and when he couldn’t find me he went to the basement and found me inside the freezer. I was there for about 45 minuted when he found me and i was starting to consider writing a letter to my parents and drinking myself to sleep.\n\nMy boss installed a chain to keep the door open after that, but i refused to ever walk in to that death trap again. Weirdest part, the keg i had holding the door open was at the other side of the room when i got out. It was a full steel keg, not something that just slides away, let alone quietly.\n\nI stop workin there shortly after for unrelated reason.\n\nThoughts?",
