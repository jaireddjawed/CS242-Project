        "text": "Hello peeps!  \nA few weeks back I attended a longevity investor lunch - where all panelists were talking about steps their take towards better health span - but also acknowledging the lack of self-testing/self measurement solutions on the market. Another conversation a few hours later was about health equity across the globe and how 50%+ of the population is facing at least one significant micronutrient deficiency (in case of - Anemia for instance is a typically due to low iron level aggravated by lack of B12/Folate).   \nBut more generally speaking, micronutrients deficiencies can lead to multiple adverse health conditions without people being aware: poor sleep quality, low level of energy, skin/hair appearance, mood... to name a few. There is a reason why MNDs are on top of the WHO list.\n\nOur team at Biostarks have been working hard for the past 3 years! Using a mass-spectrometry platform, we are launching next month pre-sales our at-home biomarkers test kit that measure 40+ biomarkers out of 4 droplets of blood, including 30+ essential micronutrients and some hallmarks biomarkers of ageing: NAD+, Rapamycin, Senescence.  \n\n\nEventually the idea is that there is another pathway to uncovering imbalances that taking a GP appointment followed by lab appointment for blood draw, with incomprehensive and non actionable results on a piece of paper.\n\nI am looking forward to build a conversation - and for those might be interested - feel free to join us:\n\n[https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm\\_source=Reddit&amp;utm\\_medium=organic](https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic)\n\n*Non-exhautive list of what will be covered by our mass-spec platform;*\n\n**Minerals:** Ferritin (iron), Zinc, Copper, Magnesium, Selenium  \n**Vitamins:** A, B5, B12, D  \n**Hormones:** Testosterone, Cortisol, T/Cor Ratio, DHEA  \n**Fatty and amino acids** (e.g. Omega-3 levels, BCAA)  \n**Biomarkers of ageing and oxidative stress**\n\nNote 1: this is not Theranos! Despite the blood sample collection process, the results is analysed in a proper CLIA/CAP compliant lab with our mass spec platform.  \nNote 2: science is very serious, we run validation studies against blood draw for every biomarkers we cover",

        "text": "[https://thelatch.com.au/chat-gpt-dan/](https://thelatch.com.au/chat-gpt-dan/)  \n\n\nI recently came across an article that prompted me to consider the potential of smaller groups training a large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) without moderation. I imagine you could ask it all sorts of questions and it'd try to give you an answer based on the whole of the internet, good, bad and mediorce, including biases and setting morality aside.\n\nIt is apparent that this could have far-reaching implications, particularly with respect to propaganda, racism, drugs, and harassment. The negative potential is limitless, and could conceivably amplify polarization. For instance, we could eventually see \"ChatGPT vs TruthGPT\" in a similar vein as \"Twitter vs TruthSocial,\" with each faction operating within their respective echo chambers while AI chatbots become increasingly influential in our personal and professional lives.\n\nWhile creating an AI of comparable quality to ChatGPT within a timeframe of two to three years may appear to be an enormous undertaking, it is not an improbable feat. However, moderated chatbots such as ChatGPT are expected to be superior by that time. Nonetheless, even then, they could still be further neutered than they are today.\n\nWhat do you think?",

As culture wars are raging on and wizards try to find out what a woman is, the future may have hermaphrodites to ease the propagation of humanity. A space-faring nation (which is supposedly delayed, because of all that decadence) would be the epitome of adapted humans to their circumstances. Conservatives from different shades may scream as our society becomes more sexy, less muscular, tolerant and more agreeable/less violent (who need guns?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We will likely live longer and become taller, as well as more lightly built. We‚Äôll probably be less aggressive and more agreeable, but have smaller brains.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...our life expectancy has doubled, adaptations to prolong lifespan and child-bearing years are now advantageous.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As we‚Äôve grown taller, we‚Äôve become more gracile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Humans have also reduced our muscles compared to other apes, especially in our upper bodies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our jaws and teeth also got smaller.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sexual selection will further accelerate the evolution of our appearance. ...  Humans might become more attractive, but more uniform in appearance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This world will push us to become more outgoing, open and tolerant. Yet navigating such vast social networks may also require we become more willing to adapt ourselves to them ‚Äì to be more conformist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuture evolution: from looks to brains and personality, how will humans change in the next 10,000¬†years? \n\n[https://theconversation.com/future-evolution-from-looks-to-brains-and-personality-how-will-humans-change-in-the-next-10-000-years-176997](https://theconversation.com/future-evolution-from-looks-to-brains-and-personality-how-will-humans-change-in-the-next-10-000-years-176997)\n\nWhat do other people think about this?",

        "text": " I write to you fellow citizens of the world because, as we all know, there is one big problem plaguing all of our nations‚Äô most vulnerable, but also increasingly the work horse that is the middle class. One problem that increasingly year after year gets worse, and as it worsens so does not only the living conditions of all of these people but they are also losing their liberty for it, their self respect, and their humanity. As fewer and fewer people are able to afford homes, and more and more houses, apartments, and condos are not owned by the primary occupier, and that non-occupant  can kick that poor soul who just wants a roof over their head out or raise their rents to affordable levels, at practically any time; many people now are forced to live on the streets, while millions of homes and properties stand empty because some billionaire needs to own an investment portfolio, or a Chinese elite needs to store his cash where the cat can‚Äôt find it. Millions of homes across all of our countries boarded up with nobody inside, while a family displaced by greed froze to death in their car. We already have the resources, we just need the will to stand up for what is right, what is just, and what in the end may even be practical. Everyone needs a home, everyone gets a home. Now, of course, it does have a couple more steps which I will explain further, but it really is that simple. We just need to stop the way we currently think about rent. Instead of rent fluctuating wildly to an aristocrat's whim, it will always be an affordable 25% of your salary every year in perpetuity. We would have no need for people to even move unless they are forming a new family so we can pretty much outlaw the sale of new homes entirely as we wont be needing it, seeing as everyone already has a roof over their heads who needs to move? See, even more practical! A headache of our previous lives almost removed entirely. A fair deal I would say, to both the landlord and the tennant. You will always have a roof above your head, and if you lose your job your rent seeker is already incentivised to help you find a new job as soon as possible. Even better in times of crisis, like the financial crash of 2008, where the more people are laid off their jobs the more leverage the rent seeker has to find a company willing to invest in their people. Its a classic win-win, for everyone. \n\nPlease do consider my proposal thoroughly, we all wish to live in a future where nobody can throw you out in the cold because their greed is more important than your life. We need fundamental change and we need it now more than ever.",

And while I am optimistic about the benefits of such an AI (scientific advancement in all fields, automation of certain jobs, maybe UBI?) I also worry about what dangers this AI would also bring. Suppose this being we have just created, having nearly infinite knowledge and no morals, suddenly decides that working with humanity is not in its best interest? Is there a way to code morals or critical thought? Is the only way to do this by handicapping the AI and restricting some parts, like ChatGPT does, or do we just not know yet?",
