        "text": "I don't know if anyone else is of this viewpoint, but it's always fascinated me. Nintendo, when it comes to their presentations and corporate nature, has never felt too much different than other gaming companies of today. In some ways, their even more gray and cold seeming, such as their neanderthal stance on let's plays. Their absolute refusal to lower the retail price on decade old games. The general \"grumpy old man\" mentality that they tend to have when it comes to embracing the future. \n\nDespite all of this, Nintendo has always felt different from other game companies. They've been portrayed as the video game Disney; this magical world of joy and happiness where you can always go to have a unique sense of fun that you really can't find anywhere else. People look past Nintendo's occasionally cold shell (as many do with Disney) and appreciate the things they make in ways you don't see from other developers fanbases. People get truly emotional about games like Super Mario Odyssey or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Not because of a gripping narrative or complex character development, but because they feel something just from playing it, from looking at it, from experiencing it. They feel the effort and love that was put into every frame of these adventures, and they channel memories that we have of playing our first Mario or Zelda game, and each new one almost feels like one we've been waiting for our whole lives. Nintendo is absolutely like any other corporation. They want to make as much money as they can. They've just managed to do that in a way that makes it feel like they're all doing it for the art, for the magic, and to watch the world have fun. \n\nOne can't forget the personalities that have driven and assisted in our love of Nintendo as well, and this is where the \"corporate vs genuine\" amazement reaches its head. These people, who are essentially businessmen, have managed to worm their way into our hearts one way or another. We have the infectious, child-like smile of Shigeru Miyamoto. We had the backstage selflessness and oddball sense of humor of Satoru Iwata. We have the coolness and almost fatherly demeanor of Masahiro Sakurai. And then we have Reggie fils-Aime, the most baffling of all. He looks, behaves, and talks like any other manufactured English speaking presenter of video game press conferences. We can all see how calculated every word and hand gesture Reggie uses is. By all accounts, he should not be as beloved as he is.\n\nBut he is.\n\nReggie fils-Aime is the human embodiment of Nintendo's entire existence. Focus grouped and business oriented, yet genuine and lovable. The fact that he isn't afraid to tell jokes, get weird, make himself look like a fool, all while wearing a suit and speaking in buzzwords. \n\nNintendo will always be an anomaly. The fact that many have looked past the boneheaded decisions and statements they've made will undoubtedly frustrate some. To others, nothing will ever be enough to keep them from buying the latest Nintendo console. \n\nAre Nintendo mostly living off of nostalgia? Perhaps. Should we idolize Nintendo as much as we do? Probably not, but we all know that fact isn't gonna stop anyone.....including me. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play my Switch while looking up memes about Reggie. ",

        "text": "Though this is common in movies, music, and really any art, I've noticed it more so with video games. Metacritic shows scores from large publications that don't seem to reflect their views at all, really. For example, take a look at the reviews for [Sea of Thieves](http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/sea-of-thieves/critic-reviews). When you get down to the scores between 5-8, they appear to be very lax. When you read the reviews however, some are much more critical than you'd think someone would be on games they'd rate a 7/10. \n\nIt appears as though the normal scale, 1-3 being bad, 4-6 being average(ish), and 7-10 being good, has been changed into a scale that looks more like 1-6 being bad, 7 being average, and 8-10 being good. The problem with this is that it can provide a skewed view of what is worth playing and what's not. It become harder to interpret scores. Going off of this alternate scale, the difference between a 3 and a 4 is almost meaningless. Similarly, it can lower the bar for truly incredible games by cheapening the meaning of a 9 or 10/10.\n\nDo you all agree that this is an issue? Why or why not? If so, what do you think the cause is and how can it be dealt with? Does it have to do with companies paying larger publications in exchange for better reviews? ",

        "text": "In a lot of classic titles, mashing is a regular component of the game, beyond just being the actions of a panicking new player.  Most classic N64 and PS2 games were sporting mashing minigames at some point. I noticed how I have started to despise mashing ever since God of War 2018 gave me the option to hold rather than mashing in the quicktime events.\n\nSome modern games have developed to focus on precise and well placed actions rather than mashing.  However, mashing still makes appearances in many modern games, particularly in quicktime events.\n\nGenerally I feel mashing is quite brainless (it's rarely at a speed that is challenging outside of Bayonetta or Banjo Kazooie), so it doesn't serve a challenging aspect. Even though you can mash very fast, in many games if you intentionally mash slowly you'll see the cinematic still progresses and is generally impossible to fail.  It is bad for RTI or carpel tunnel if you are gaming or using computers a lot, and in addition to the physical wear on yourself I also find it tends to wear down my controllers a lot more quickly.  \n\nOverall, I think mashing could be removed and replaced with press to hold, or if a challenge is desired, then a complex series of varied inputs is much more interesting.  \n\nIs there anyone that enjoys mashing as a core component of the game, or feels it improves the quality of the game overall compared to alternative options?",

This generation, we've jumped to 1080p being the standard and 60fps being more common on consoles, along with various dynamic lighting techniques (ambient occlusion, subsurface scattering, etc) and previously rare texture effects such as tessellation being more commonplace.\n\nSpecifically for next gen consoles, what common features would we require to justify a new generation of hardware? I'm personally of the opinion that 60fps should be the bare minimum, with later generation support for 120hz+ displays. I would also like to see better texture filtering, in general. HDR is another huge thing that I've greatly enjoyed, but I still feel like we're waiting for consumers and TVs to catch up (even high end TVs have barely scraped the potential of HDR in terms of nits and technology). \n\nMore importantly, **we need significantly better CPUs for more** ***interactivity*** **with the game worlds.** By that, I mean more advanced AI, better physics, advanced demolition, realistic wounds, etc without suffering from bottlenecks.\n\nWhat kind of rendering, AI, loading techniques, physicality, etc. would you like to see more common?

        "text": "What do you guys think about the paid/premium mods concept?\n\nSteam tried to do that a few years ago and they failed miserably because it wasn't properly organized and handled. Bethesda tried that with their Creation Club and the initial offerings were so bland that the free mods on the Nexus were actually better. The issue was so divisive for the community. It took awhile for certain CC mods to actually be seen as worth paying for as some are now. Blizzard also tried their hand with it recently with StarCraft 2's premium arcade maps, and some community members expressed their concern.\n\nI know there's an aversion to paying for anything extra after buying a game at full price. I know that some gamers feel that mods should always remain free.\n\nHowever, consider the following:\n\n- certain mods have been a paid commodity in the past (I'm talking paid maps in older games like Quake)\n- some have become their own major games in their own right (CStrike, Garry's Mod)\n- some have kickstarted entire genres (DOTA, PUBG)\n- other creators are paid by developers for their work (Ark, Arma)\n\nSo, with all of these in mind, do you guys think a paid/premium mods system will eventually become accepted by gamers?\n\nBy that, I'm talking of more people becoming accepting of the idea that a modder putting in a lot of time and effort for their work should receive a fair and just compensation via a paid/premium mods system. In a way, players don't just immediately think that someone creating a premium mod means that person \"sold out\" or that a company selling a premium mod equates to \"greed.\"\n\nWhat do you guys think? How do you envision such a system, or something to emulate? Where would you draw the line?",

        "text": "As a fan Of Nikola Tesla it's always inspiration and yet depressing to see his life towards the end. From being ridiculed by Edison to denial of being credited with the invention of radio till after he passed away.\n\nAs a Fan of Sega. I often see comparisons as to how this company was far ahead of it's time and moving the video games forward. \n\nI wanted to Highlight some of these things that I got to experience in my life and wanted to share and look forwards a healthy discussion. As always I appreciate this Sub and it's users passion for video games. It's no chronological order, just on experience. This isn't an opinion on quality of games but it's factory that influenced the games we love today. \n\nSo one my first experience with being \"mind blown\" by Sega was not via a single video game but by the forward thinking they were doing. This was in the mid 1990's and we had the Sega Channel. Sega Channel was in my opinion a decade ahead of it's time. It was delivering on demand gaming to a home console via broadband coaxial cable at a time when AOL dial up internet was still climbing. It was subscription based, and the titles would change in different variables. It was the Netflix of Sega Games but over 20 years ago.  \n\nDo you all remember when Xbox was getting praise when it's Kinect came out for it's innovation and both Nintendo and Sony had motion detecting devices? This just happened in the last decade. Sega had already produced this 10 years before the WiiMote! It was called the Activator. Now don't get me wrong, I don't believe this activator was the most user friendly and neither the most fun, but was was innovative and ahead of it's time absolutely. \n\n3D Fighting games. From the love we had of Tekken or Soul Calibur, etc.. that all began with Sega's Virtua Fighter. When this came out for the first time I was seeing games being described in Polygons. I was so excited to get a crack at this in the arcades. Then Virtua Fighter 2 came out, the graphics we would expect from 3D games would change forever. \n\nNights Into Dreams:  The fluidity of what it should feel like to fly as a character was defined. I don't want to get into a review of the game here but needless to say this was a game that was of a major discussion for it's technical achievements, creativity, and fun. \n\n Open End Worlds(ie: Grant Theft Auto), Quick Time events(ie: Resident Evil), Real time environments with Day and Night effects(seen in many games from Zelda to Witcher): all of these were pioneered in one Game: Shenmue. This game had a world you can be a part of as a character far before anything like this was actually happening. \n\nOnline Home Console gaming: It first started with the Dreamcast. Launching in 1999. The Dreamcast had a built in 56k modem. For some younger players, who would believe you could have smooth game play on 56k well a big part of this innovation was Sega launching it's own ISP to tapping directly into it's servers allowing gamers to connect to each other and actually talk to one another. And of course within in this you Downloadable content. Yup we were updating rosters in NLF2k before DLC was a thing. \n\nMaybe it's my love for Sega, or how I seen them push it's developers to the edge, give them huge budgets and say \"give me the game of tomorrow\" that made me write this. I guess as an old gamer I see games of today and see a lack of passion in delivering finished goods to their consumer. From Free games to new \"big budget\" games, that require updates frequently to function correctly. That was not possible in my day. Don't know why it's necessary now. Or maybe I'm just old and all us old folk tend to believe we lived in the \"golden age\"  of something. Thanks for reading. ",

So I have a couple questions:\n\n* What role should PvP take on when it comes to MMOs? For example, should they be side content, or late-game content?\n\n* What form should PvP take? Should it be confined to safe minigame scenarios or would a free-for-all system work? What are the pros and cons of these?\n\n* Does the general player base necessarily have to be against PvP? \n\n* **New Question: How should gang-killing be controlled, if at all?**\n\nFor those of you who don't know how PvP works in Runescape, there are safe minigames where you can fight other players without losing your items, but there are also worlds and areas where you can be attacked freely by others. A simple answer to the PvP question would be for people who don't want to be killed to just stay out of those worlds and places, but there are also non-PvP reasons to go to those places and no way of showing your intentions to others.",

I'm definitely buying Hitman 2.\n\nI just spent the last 5 hours, lost in time, playing Hitman: Blood Money -- which I would argue is the best in the series, but I'll get back to that.\n\nFirst and foremost, the level design. Ignore the graphic quality, [but pay attention to the design.](https://youtu.be/2-k-gvukYTo) This is St. Petersburg Stakeout, mission 2 of Hitman 2. I mean, come on. This game came out in 2002. This map is freaking gigantic when you're playing it. Underground, verticality, snow. It's beautiful. Of course, there's [this level](https://youtu.be/mtzaPfTlBGU) from Hitman: Contracts which is like an interactive horror movie. The iconic [A New Life](https://youtu.be/UWOihfN1C24) mission, with all of its beautiful hidden methods of assassination (and of course, [this gem](https://youtu.be/JKbptWt_Qs4).)\n\nThe score. Have you ever sat the fuck down and listened to any of the music from Hitman? [Exploration](https://youtu.be/fzeAnxsR9kU) is a personal favorite of mine. And of course the use of Ave Maria in Blood Money. And here's [an awesome piece](https://youtu.be/x96fiht5grQ) from Absolution. I could seriously go on and on and on about the score. \n\nThen you have the atmosphere. This could easily be tied with level design (yes, I *am* talking about the entirety of Hitman: Contracts, how did you know?) but how could I ever forget the death scene in Hitman 2? A dead 47 on a stark white background, leaking a pool of blood. Or the actual dread you feel escaping the hospital in Contracts. Or the beautiful carefree seaside vistas in Hitman 2016, Absolution and... Basically every other Hitman, which also ties into level design. I mean, how the hell do you make 47 different seaside vista levels and they're all beautifully unique? Just compare the first level of Hitman 2 to the Chilean level in Blood Money to the first level of Absolution or the Vista in Hitman 2016 -- really? Seriously. \n\nUnique game play and overall game design. Disguising yourself. I wish I could just do that in every game. I mean, wow. What other games on the magnitude of Hitman have that mechanic? How fucking iconic is Diana alone? How iconic are 47s silverballers? His fiberwire? The game rewards you for doing what is expected, but can you just waltz into a place and massacre everyone with an MP5 and a nail gun? Hell yeah! Can you try on nearly anyone's clothes?! Hell yeah! Want to be a bald ass suit man? Go ahead! Hate defaults? Customize your load out and upgrade your weapons! Blend in! Or don't! The developers literally let you do whatever you want, and despite the Hitman series  having closed storylines, it sure feels more like free roam than GTA sometimes.\n\nA real magnum opus, if you ask me.

        "text": "Hey, All. As of late I’ve been having a bit of an internal struggle with how I want the future of my gaming experiences to play out. So to put things into perspective, here’s a bit on how my mentality of gaming works.\n\nMy game library typically consists of 2D indie titles, as I personally find them to be more engrossing, and they take up significantly less processing power. Originally I had purchased a Macbook for cheap for college, and have stuck with it ever since. It’s only recently that I had even considered using a computer for games, as I had grown up a console gamer almost all my life. It’s only recently that I have learned that this computer isn’t the most ideal for gaming of any capacity in the first place. Additionally, I have been using my Macbook for my full time job, which takes up a lot of storage and memory on my computer as it is. \n\nAs it stands, I don’t have the financial stability to fully shift over to a Gaming PC, though I was given a PS4 as a gift from a family member, and have been thinking of sticking with it as my main platform for the indie games that I love, as it is also capable of performing with physical AAA games as well, for a significantly low price reused. I’m only uncertain if the PS4 digital library will be able to carry over to PS5 or other consoles later down the line, or if it’s even smart to keep investing in digital games for a platform that will most likely be rendered obsolete within a couple of generations and lose its servers.\n\nI know that this may seem like just insipid rambling, but all I’m really looking for here is a little insight on the matter, guys, as well as input on how to best approach this gaming hurdle that I find myself ensnared in. Is it less ludicrous to stick with Mac and PS4 for gaming, or should I just bite the bullet and put my gaming experience on hold until I have enough of a stable income that I’d be able to invest a Gaming PC in about a year? Thanks. ",

Couldn't care less, and it is honestly a bit embarrassing. I was always disgusted by Gamestop sacking that editor who later went on to start Giant Bomb because he refused to give *Kane and Lynch* a good score. I also never liked Anita Sarkeesian, she didn't put out enough quality to match her funding, made unbiased or downright false comments several ties, and stole frequently things from smaller content creators.\n\nKiA is now basically a reactionary echo-chamber, far removed from videogames. Although, they admittedly helped a bit by spamming the FTC about disclosure rules (although they were already a work in progress and coming along well before the movement).",

        "text": "I have just begun playing Pathologic (aside: currently it’s about $2 on Steam). I know a bit about the game coming into it. I know it gets brutal. I know that it is slow and painful and punishing. Very hostile to the player in both tone and gameplay. So far, I can see why. There is little guidance, you move slowly, the world is oppressive and strange.\n\nBut I also know that it has become a cult classic. People adore this game, as evidenced by the three part RPS article, the two hour YouTube dissection / analysis video, etc. I picked it up on the basis of this acclaim. Knowing what little I know about it, I’m finding myself sucked in to the experience. I have an urge to return to the game and uncover more secrets.\n\nIf I had come to this game blind, though, I probably would have already bounced off of it. You’re slow, combat is clunky, there’s endless dialog, I’m constantly lost. These are things I generally use as signs that I should give up on a game. That there will be very little ‘fun’ here.\n\nI keep encountering the idea when I read about the game that Pathologic’s lack of fun is deliberate. The designers want the player to feel the desperation of survival in a dying, plague ridden town. It’s interesting because part of it may be a lack of resources to smooth out some of the rough edges (poor combat, for example), but at the same time aspects of the design are undeniably deliberate, like the constant march of the narrative and the ability to easily have opportunities for progress slip through your fingers. It seems that the game intends for you to fail.\n\nI guess I don’t fully know what to make of this. I deeply admire the ideas at play here. I wish more dev teams would have the drive to make experiences that are so narratively and mechanically synchronized. But if I stumbled across a game blind, and it made me feel strained and confused, I doubt I would be able to stick it out. I can’t really put myself into the mindset of someone who was encountering Pathologic without any background information. There are things at play from the very start that are compelling for their unabashed strangeness, like the Executors and Tragedians. Would this have been enough to intrigue me and get me to want to see more? Impossible to say.\n\nI saw someone, in a post on the remake/spiritual sequel Pathologic 2, saying that they are unsure about some of the design decisions, because being tied to survival meters and having long crafting sessions take away from the fun of the experience. He was called out as having never played the original and told that these mechanics are necessary to the experience. I can see both sides here. I think a game like Pathologic is wonderful, but I don’t know how it finds its audience. I can’t think of many games that are highly praised despite a lack of traditional fun. But that’s probably because of inherent difficulty in convincing a player to, from the start, endure difficulty and monotony for potentially 20+ hours. A bleak movie comes and goes in 2 or 3 hours, so whatever value is there can be found without a massive time commitment. Books ask for that sort of time, but the medium has developed a respect that will make people put the time in in hopes of a higher reward than pure enjoyment. It feels like games have not reached that status yet. I wonder if they ever will and what it would take.",

That is how I've always felt with Defender.\n\nDefender is a remake of the classic arcade game released in 2002 on all of the Fifth Generation gaming consoles, and is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. In short, you fly around and shoot things, but I don't think anyone cares to read a longwinded review or a synopsis on what the game is about or a personal history on why I like it so much. I'll leave that in the comments.\n\nI want to talk about games you love, that for whatever reason never got into the mainstream or made as big of a splash as you think they should have.\n\nMaybe I just don't get out enough, but I have **never** met another person irl who has ever played Defender, which is pretty insane considering it came out on all three consoles. Even on youtube there are only two reviews of the game (CGR shits all over it and he can meet me in the streets.)\n\nAdvertising could be a part of it, or maybe there is something else, but why do some amazing games just fly under the radar? What are your thoughts - why does this happen? And do you have a game that you think more people should have experienced? Let's talk about it. ",

Why do games differ so much in that regard, tho?\n\nI completely understand why people prefer a more region like accent but, for the sake of the seriousness of the acting and plot, unless they want to go for comedic value, those types of accents just put me off a lot.\n\nThis is not a criticism on different nationalities accents when speaking english, please don't think of this criticism that way.

I get a little peeved when the most significant factor in someone liking a 'character' in a video game boils down to their aesthetic if the game itself is narrative-driven.\n\nNowadays, with games featuring 'romances' as a legitimate feature with draw for certain players, I'd have to say that they are generally sorely lacking in implementation and have an almost dangerous feel of objective-based wooing processes for romantic reward. I would rather they were implemented some time in the far future when the complexities of human relationships could be simulated far better, and response and interaction have gone further than a dialogue wheel. \n\nA friend asserted that video games provide an engagement with escapism for many. The idea of pursuing and winning an ideal romantic partner (no matter how shallow the process) is just an extension of this idea of a world where succeeding is **always** as simple and as rewarding as making the right choices, putting in enough time and/or learning from your mistakes. I disagreed only because my definition of an entertaining game has changed (since it was probably true for me at a younger age). I haven't thought too deeply about it yet.\n\nWould you say that giving gifts, flirting at every opportunity and toggling paragon! answers are fine as an option for people who prefer/appreciate it?

The Culling II probably deserved it, but others almost certainly didn't.  Lawbreakers seemed like a pretty entertaining game, but it suffered from \"wait and see\" syndrome.  Everyone said \"let's wait and see what happens\", which is fine, but literally *everyone* chose to do that, and almost immediately the response was \"No one's playing it!  Dead game!\"  The Chivalry dev's title Mirage: Arcane Warfare might have been ultimately flawed in the eyes of many, but it was (like The Culling II) quite literally dead on arrival.  It was entertaining enough, I actually enjoyed my time with it, but I was only able to find matches for a couple days before it was utterly abandoned.\n\nThe arena shooter genre is permanently plagued by this issue.  Old arena shooter fans constantly lament the death of the genre, but when games appear, they fail to support them, despite being seemingly desperate for anything new.  Xonotic, Toxikk, Reflex, and Warsow, all dead.  Quake Champions, miraculously, has been scraping by, but it's the exception.\n\nVery recently a game called Sky Noon released, a little indie title, the dev's first game, but it looks like barrels of fun.  Essentially a shooter where you knock people off the map like Smash Bros. instead of outright killing them, and there's grappling hooks.  I'd buy it immediately if I wasn't broke, but in the meantime all the discussions on Steam are \"why buy it if no one plays it?\"  It's a chicken or the egg problem, isn't it?  If everyone realized the stupidity of the question and bought it anyways there wouldn't be an issue, and not revealing player count in the first place should alleviate it somewhat, shouldn't it?",

        "text": "Puzzle design is probably the hardest thing to do in game design; making the player think laterally about how to proceed requires lateral thinking on the developer's own part, and most developers would just go for more straightforward mechanics.\n\nBut, Mark Brown, brave as he is, [has tried to decode what makes a good puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjC6fa_YBg). Here's a short summary of his findings:\n\nAccording to that video, good puzzles have five main parts:\n\n1. Good Mechanics: Mechanics should be easy to understand yet appliable in many situations.\n2. The Catch: There has to be a seeming contradiction with the situation; no just \"pressing a button\" and being done with it.\n3. The Revelation: The solution must not be obvious, but completely logical within the realm of the game.\n4. The Assumption: A good puzzle should give you a starting point, yet mislead you into thinking said starting point is the solution.\n5. Presentation: A puzzle needs to be presented in such a way that the pieces of the puzzle are obvious, but the solution isn't.\n\nAs puzzles are said to be one of the big draws of Zelda, I decided to take a look at puzzle design in the Zelda series.\n\nIf there's any puzzle in Zelda that fulfills all of these ideals, here's a puzzle from A Link to the Past that is simple, yet requires very outside-the-box thinking: the Laser Eye Door in A Link to the Past. The Catch is that a door with an eye fires at you when you face it, making proceeding back through the door difficult. The Assumption is that you need to attack the eye, but it's invincible. The Revelation is when you realize that you can face away from the eye by charging a Spin Attack. And the puzzle is Presented in such a way that you can face away from the door and stop it from firing at you.\n\nI feel that Zelda's biggest problem with its puzzle design, particularly in 3D games, is that there's often no \"catch\" to it. Puzzles in 3D Zelda games tend to make no effort to mislead the player into thinking of a wrong solution, making the puzzles themselves very shallow. When you figure out what you need to do, there's no reason to look for wrinkles in the situation or think laterally.\n\nLet's focus on the one puzzle from each of the 3D games from the pre-BotW days first:\n\n* Ocarina of Time: [Just throw a bomb into a skull pot](https://youtu.be/OeNgLsBFY4E?t=13m19s)\n* Majora's Mask: [Shoot icicles to clear blockage on platforms](https://youtu.be/U13F1PA2xNc?t=7m8s)\n* Wind Waker: [Hookshot onto targets](https://youtu.be/HFnPE9NTX2c?t=18m26s) (actually, every Hookshot puzzle can be boiled down to this)\n* Twilight Princess: [Use Ball and Chain to get chandelier to move](https://youtu.be/-bAn9eFBDMQ?t=20m1s)\n* Skyward Sword: [Use Gust Bellows to blow away hot volcanic ash](https://youtu.be/msPtXKS-YX0?t=11m17s)\n\nAnd even in Zelda's most recent outing, Breath of the Wild, the puzzles are harder, but not because there's no catch. In fact, the only reason that the puzzles are a bit harder in BotW is because they hide what you need to do most of the time. For example: a few of the Korok puzzles, there's no indication in-game that you need to set three fruit trees to have the same fruit on them, nor is there any indication that the piles of leaves are anything more than scenery.\n\nBut here's one Shrine puzzle that just pisses me off. Not because it's hard, but because of *how* they try to make it hard: [Bravery's Grasp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcwEeWXxzpY).\n\nThe reason *why* it angers me is that there is no indication that the laser shooter can be picked up and moved around. Sure, you can use Stasis on it like most light-brown objects, but you don't pick up any laser shooter earlier in the game, and this puzzle element isn't use again after that. If it weren't for hiding that you could move the laser shooter, the puzzle would've been laughably easy.\n\nI know that environmental puzzle design is infinitely easier in 2D than in 3D since the player can see more in the former than in the latter. But the Zelda team can at least try to make puzzles involve more misdirection to require more lateral thinking. And they shouldn't make it harder by hiding what to do, but they should make \\*how\\* to do it harder.",

When was this ever not the case for the genre? Have people become so accustomed to stuff like Skyrim which allows you to \"go anywhere, do anything\" that they're now trying to apply that philosophy to every other genre? \n\n\nI feel like, and maybe this is a wrong assumption, that some people believe all games should be everything to every player. And that's really a damaging view. Some games DO require precision. Wishing to \"express yourself\" through the game mechanics just doesn't jive with every game you're going to pick up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what these people mean with the phrase, though, so if that's the case, can someone educate me?\n\n(for that matter, I'm also really confused by what \"feels too gamey\" means... you're playing a video game, what else is it going to feel like?)",

Second person storytelling involves someone telling someone else's story from their own perspective (e.g \"I saw him talking to the girl\").\n\nWhile there are many first person and third person games, I've never really heard of a second person game. How would that even work, seeing your character from someone else's perspective, instead of from your own perspective or from a camera's perspective? \n\nI'm not saying this is a good idea, or that it should exist, just curious if such a game does exist? \n\nI think there's two ways to go about it: either having the camera fixed to an NPC's head (could be annoying), or fixed to another players head. The latter could make for an interesting co-op experience",

        "text": "So, Forza Horizon 4 announced at E3 has been confirmed to have a major progression overhaul, namely Horizon Life. What this is, it tracks everything you do in the shared world, you can progress the game doing any feature available in FH4. You can earn everything by just taking photos, exploring, collecting cars or traditionally race. There’s no main game or storyline you are forced to do to progress, nothing is forced upon you in fact.\n\nI can just imagine something like Destiny,  (where you are forced to do the main story to get all the content the game has to offer) taking this to the next level. Ok you may only start with one planet, say Earth. But everything you DO on earth earns you credit to go to other planets. Whether you want to just roam the map on Patrol and loot OR get to know the story OR play PvP and Strikes with friends, you can earn your progress for your character by only one of these things.\n\nWhat about Pokémon? You could choose to roam the world and nothing else, or you could go ahead and take on the league. Even just making friends with your mons gains you progress.\n\nHow would you feel? Would such a feature make games more “exciting” and personal? Would such a thing be great for the multiplayer worlds coming out in abundance?\n\nI’m sure Fallout 76 is going to use this progression model too and hopefully we see more in the coming years.",

        "text": "Majority of stories in video games can be easily labeled by one simple term - sadly, i am not sure how exacly it called in english, but in russian it's a \"survivor's syndrome\": when story told by someone who, for example, survived in war, saved the planet, did something what others could not, or by any other means prevailed there where others have failed. This makes people feel special and believe that they have a chance of sucsess too, that's why this kind of storytelling is usually well-received not only in games, but literally everywhere. \n\nBut how do you feel about stories about those who didn't make it? For each winner there must be many losers. People read stories about those who won, but would you want to read about those who tried, but never sucseeded? That's the first question i want to ask, because not long ago i created a small visual novel, where i tried to show how the life feels from the perspective of someone who failed to understand and love our world, who never found the purpose of life. Few people understood what i tried to tell and liked it. Some others - do not. One guy in particular said that gamers do not need stories like that at all, he said that the world interested in victors, and not the losers, and said that people dive into imaginary stories to feel better, special, to gain hope and inspiration, and there is no need to use those stories to remind them about the cruelty of our reality. \n\nBut i think that stories like mine, that bring unpleasant things to the light are important because it can be hard to live in the world where everyone are trying to ignore disturbing themes,  that makes people think \"everyone but me concider this non important\". They don't need hope or other types of lies, they just want to know that someone out there understands the truth, that someone sees this world as they see it, and feels same things as they feel. The others, who don't share this vision may also learn a lot about other's vision of the world if they are open-minded enough to understand it (not accept - but simply understand). This kind of stories may force them to think about usually ignored problems of our society, and help them to become more understanding to other's problems, or maybe even figure a way to solve some of the issues that making life worse. Yes, going out of the comfort zone and see things that you usually tried to avoid may be hard and not  fit for everyone, but that's not the reason to not talk about them at all - they are not going anywhere from our lifes, and reality won't change no matter how many stories with happy endings we will write or read. \n\nFor some reason, in movies or books this kind of plots are more or less common, when in games almost always everything circles around \"overcoming the challenges and having a sucsess, if you try hard enough - you will make it\" type of stories. Of course, there is several exceptions, but they are not really popular and usually only proving the rule.  So how do you feel about stories that bring out something dark, unpleasant?  And what kind of stories do you perfer, and why? ",

Your average first or third person shooter can have the following options for instance: \n\n- AI \n- Health\n- Damage\n\nAnd as a reward you could get a small XP or Cash bonus by increasing these like games have been doing for a while. \nSome racing games (I believe GRID 2008 had this, possibly others) have had this level of flexibility in regards to difficulty and it worked perfectly. \n\nSo why wasn't this something that was moved over to other games?

I used to be able to get hooked on your average FPS and have a blast, same with other online multiplayer games, but after getting into more high skill ceiling games it's become increasingly harder.\n\nTo explain: I got into the competitive Melee/PM scene roughly 5 years ago. I spent likely the greater part of ~500 hours practicing and playing Melee. Maybe 100 with PM. It was some of the most enjoyable experiences I ever had with games. It felt so satisfying to play and get better at. I spent about 400 with Sm4sh as well.\n\nSame with Team Fortress 2, which I'm sure everyone knows about. The game's skill ceiling is insanely high and I always feel like I'm getting better. The game just feels so enjoyable. I've dumped 2.2k hours into this game of just MGE and playing. I still play it to this day.\n\nThe only thing is...I've noticed after all this, I just can't get into some online games as much. Mario Tennis Aces was a game I picked up on launch day. I played through the story mode and had a blast. After I hopped online though. It just felt like something was missing. I just can't explain it. It just didn't have the rush of the previous games I mentioned.\n\nSome other instances of this I can recall are Fortnite, Splatoon (which I really loved at first), Overwatch, Pokken, and many others.\n\nI'm honestly not sure if my taste in games has changed, but it definitely feels like it came in part due to my newfound love of competitive games. Has anyone else who's dove into competitive FG's or FPS noticed this? Am I just crazy?",

Because If I make a lot of relic units researchables the game is gonna turn into a rush and I dont want that.\n2. The factions - I already have several factions that would be playable in the game. Such as the: Great Kingdom, Greenskins/Children of Udurkal/Choosen of Udurkal, Solar Empire, Eldritch, Rutna Empire, Pagan Revolution, Quaternary Alliance, Cult of Seraph, Followers of Morus, Vermin and Choosen of Tuous\n3. Originality - I was thinking very hard about this and I am still to this day running into a dead end. I dont know how to make something original.\n\nLet me present you the factions:\n\nThe Great Kingdom (name pending) - Thi faction is heavily inspired by renaissance italy. Building would have a blend of medieval/renaissance style to them. Units would be very reinaissance styled. Like the scout units would be Squire band which would have wrist mounted crossbows and flails. They would be very early unit. And the builder units would have and exoskeleton arm controlled by series of strings and pulleys, it would also have a staff would work as a wrench and a hammer.\n\nAs for the infantry units would be:\n\nAssault Knights - Knights with semi-automatic crossbows and would be caable meele fighters. Knight Lithenaunt would be their morale upgrade (Morale regen + increase in morale). They would also have kits such as a Siege kit(Two of the Assault Knights transform into Siege Knights with shoulder mounted break action cannons) and Steelshot kit ( Two of the knights would have big backpacks and they would wield gatling cannon which would fire molten steel).\n\nBand of Brigands - Band of no gooders/gangsters. They would have a flying mechanics with da vinci styled wings and self-made steel talons attached to their boots. They would wields exotic knives and multibarreled flintlock pistols or just flintlock with ingravings. Gang leader- A morale upgrade for the BoB. They would also get upgrade from the Quatermaster shack which would let them throw anti-armour bombs.\n\nKings Guard - Heavy infantry unit. An elite units of knights who would be unloacked after the capture of a relic point. These guys would wield Special flintlock weapons and power swords. They would be clad in black metal armour and have diffrent colored sashes around them.\n\nVehicles:\n\nAttack spiral - Light monowheel vehicle designed for fast attack and anti armour. Able to be converted into and anti infantry vehicle.\n\nTank- Smaller scale da vinci tank with three cannons on the front side (Able to turn the two extra cannons of to increase the frerate of the main cannon) and also all around the cannoun would stick out smaller cannon which would fire on the infantry units.\n\nClockwork knight - A walker vehicle. Able to engage in meele combat and also be able to be converted for range combat.\n\nLore: The Great Kingdom was at first a small tribe. However after 100 years from the stars descended 3 gods to help these tribals. Richard the Warrior taught them art of smithery, fighting and warfare. Anastas the Alchemist taught the art of medicine, brewing and alchemy. And Peter the Craftsman taught them they art of Architecture and Craftsmenship.\n\nTogether they made a prosporous kingdom. However one day the gods dissapeared. A lot of the folk say they returned to the starts, others say they are still among them hiding adn watching them as they evolve and prosper.\n\nThey are still worshiped to this day in their dedicated temples.\n\nRacial features: The citizens of The Great Kingdom would be very similiar to a regular human. But they would have paler skin and pupiles eyes. Males would have a lot of facial hair however some of them chose to shave it instead.\n\nStory: The story would follow two characters. An Archivist (non-playable neutral faction) who goes by the name as Joshua. His mission is something like chronicler.He would follow the Lord Rulf in order to make notes into the tome of the named faction.\n\nThis is all for now I will add later parts such as other factions their lore and their units. Maybe tomorrow.\n\nEDIT 2 : So I have decided to make couple of changes and finishes.\n\nStory of the Great Kingdom campaing: First 2 missions would be tutorial mission, simple enough. The third mission would a fight against couple of rebels. \n\nHowever 3th mission where the story gets interesting. Mission 3 would be about hiring the Brigands (and their introduction) against the local rebels. This is new to Lord Rulf because he stricly remembers that the CODEX states that the knight shouldnt use criminals as a military unit. \n\nOn mission 4 Lord Rulf gets a task of subject local peasent village. He would get acess to Mortar carts, Clockwork knights and Tanks. This where Lord Rulf starts having doubts about the Kings actions and commands. He rememebrs the kingdom used to handle these rebelions diffrently. Sure they handled it violently but not with such brutal force. \n\nMission 5 will be a holdout mission, Rulf gets a task from the Kings Guard to hold the relic which they discovered in that village. In this mission you will be assaulted from two sides. One by the orcs the other by the Dukes army. Also in this mission you get introduced to the University (recruits Alchemist (hero unit) and Doctor (attachable healer unit). On the end of the mission one of the orcs screams \"Lets get out of here, we are not paid enough for this!\". In the interlude between mission 6 and 7 one of the Guard approaches Rulf and says that they are lucky to survive. Rulf turns his entire body towards the battle that occured. He comes to the conclusion in his  mind that this was a trap set by the Duke and some hired orcs. Unfortunatly thats not true. Rulf is then cut into his left should by the Guard and the rest of the Guard open fire at the Knights around the Rulf. Fortunatly the Knights have a number advantage and all of the Guards die. As Rulf is recovering from his wounds one of the squires found a  pergament with a signed deal. Is says that the Duke was paid to send someof his army against Rulfs forces. Rulf decides after the recovery to go after the Orks that attacked them from the other side..\n\nMission 6 would be a fight against the orks. After the fight Rulf would find on chieftains body another pergament which says that his tribe/clan was paid to attack Rulfs forces after he destroyed the village. Rulf relizes that the whole entire plan was to make his army look like it was caught in the crossfire between orks and dukes forces. And thats why Guard also tried to kill him because people would believe only him. After this realization he decides to go Rogue.\n\nMission 7 would be a fight againt the Knights and the Solar Empire. With an option to turn these sides against each other. Rulf decides that the best way to make the Great Kingdom bleed would be to strike where they are the weakest. The diplomacy. This mission would envolve 2 diplomats of the Great Kingdom and Solar Empire. Player would have a mission to kill these two diplomats after that the two sides would start fighting against eachother. Player would have also an option to recruit Kings Guard through an optional objective.\n\nEnding: Afteall this the Rulf realizes that he is good as dead. If he would return to the king guillotine wouldnt miss him. He realizes that he has nowhere to go. Archivist gives him an offer to join the Archivists since he know a lot about his people, kingdom and forces. Rulf agrees and joins the Archivists. The rest of his knights/army become something like merrymen. Destroying the Kingdom for its vileness.\n\nAdditional units: Hero units:\n\nLord - Expert at meele combat. This unit would be early avaible.\n\nAlchemist - Caster. He would have abilities such as Elixir of Rust that would decrease units armour.\n\nSuport unit: Doctor - She would be an attachable unit. She would have a healing aura. She would have a slow firing range attack which would be effective against heavy infantry.\n\nSiege unit: Mortar cart- Artillery unit. It would have an option to fire in burtst at the cost of slow reload time or single fire mode.\n\nSmall note: I have some Concept art . I would like to post it here but I dont know. What do you guys think.\n\nAlso next time I will write about the Orcs.",

And I've played the new one too. \n\nAm I the only one here who thinks that the structure and mechanics of Hitman games is so limiting that it almost feels like you're playing a point-and-click puzzle game? It feels like the game is too ambitious for its time (especially the new one).\n\nThe game is supposed to make you feel like you are a real hitman, operating in a real world, filled with real people who react to everything you do. And you're supposed to assassinate your targets in clever ways without being detected (just like real hitmen). However the problem is that all of the NPCs in these games have a pattern. They keep cycling between the same positions and the same actions. You're supposed to observe this and then choose your method of assassination based on whatever they're going to do next. If you're supposed to poison a drink, the game will tell you which glass exactly to poison. This is when the suspension of disbelief breaks in the game and it becomes apparent to you that you are NOT THE ONE IN CONTROL OF ANYTHING. The developers of the game have already planned out everything, and you're just supposed to '' Point and click ''. \n\nWhereas if you compare this game to a game like GTA, its completely different. Let's say you have a generic drug war mission in GTA, where you have to hijack a truck full of drugs. There's an aspect of unpredictability and spontaneity there. There are countless possibilities of how you can hijack the truck. You can even destroy the truck if you're not careful. It feels less like a '' point and click '' game, and more like real life, because of that level of interactivity. \n\nThis element of unpredictability is not there in any of the Hitman games. The only way I can see it happening is if they make tremendous, gigantic improvements to game AI....to the point where a NPC's behavior pattern is not recognizable by the player. I don't think they can do that any time soon. \n\nSo is Hitman too ambitious for this time?\n\n",

        "text": "Dark Cloud was the first game I ever played on my very own Playstation 2. Sure, I'd played other games at friends and cousins houses, but it was *my* first game, and I played the shit out of it. I put in endless hours, mastered the weapon upgrade mechanics which are burned into my brain to this day, and I am sad to say after putting a solid four hours into it yesterday - Dark Cloud sucks.\n\nAt least now it does. It was an early title for the PS2, so I'm not going to sit here and shit on it, things change, tastes develop, but I was so upset yesterday, with both the game and myself for how much I didn't enjoy it.\n\nIf anyone really cares to hear me wax poetic about it's flaws I'll do so in the comments, but in short it comes down to a terrible grind, X mashing combat, and painfully slow upgrade mechanics. Most of the characters are too boring to play to be able to upgrade them, and most obviously, it's repetitive as dirt.\n\nI will say, I still love the city building, and firmly believe that aspect of the game will always stay golden, but the rest has rusted. \n\nOver the last several months I've seen plenty of \"Game that aged poorly\" discussion posts on a variety of subs, and while I'm sorry to start the same circlejerk all over again, I really wanted to share my experience.\n\nNo need to make a list, but is there one game in particular that you came back to full of nostalgia, that just broke your heart?\n\n\nSIDENOTE: I remember not liking Dark Cloud 2 as an older kid because I felt it was too complicated. I think I'm going to pop it in tomorrow, since I've noticed the general consensus is that it is a better game. I can't wait to find out. \n\n*Edit: Cheesy Edit, but wanted to thank this subreddit for being so cool with conversation. I know I'm not the only person who finds this game sentimental, and it will still remain one of my favorite games of all time for the fun it gave me when I was a kid. I understand I'm getting older, and am spoiled by better games and dwindling patience. I loved Dark Cloud, I still do, and always will. Let's hope that Level-5, who has created some amazing games since this first effort, will someday make a third title. If you feel as sentimental as I do, you'll be right there at the front of the line with me, and I can't wait to join you.*",

        "text": "Hey there!\n\nSo I came back from the Thai army bootcamp for a 10 day break and while I was there I was writing in my notebook about how I sooooo dearly wanna get back to shooters, RPGs, Grand Strategy games, and maybe try some pacifist playstyles as I was kinda sick of the jingoism and toxicity of the army. Upon coming home though... after playing **some** shooters, Grand Strategy Games, RPGs, and Stealth games, I came to an upsetting realization that the not only were non-violent or pacifist routes kinda boring and underdeveloped compared to the combat aspect, I also wish we didn't have to outright kill people who get in our way. \n\nI understand that games are usually about conflict and violence is considered one of the major examples of such. And without thinking about it too hard, I guess it's easier to create a fleshed out combat system than a diplomatic/speech system. I mean, in Fallout New Vegas and co. I realized that with combat, you have all these amazing options like melee, energy weapons, explosives, guns, and then you even have more options like the Assault Rifle, Plasma Rifle, Dynamite, Power Fists, etc. and then there's even the upgrades you give to them. Hell, the fact that you can walk around, aim, and just have all that movement. Meanwhile... speech only pops up during conversations and it's no where as 'free' or 'flowing' as the combat system.  (... and yes Barter is a speech skill but I think the vast majority don't even bother with it :b )\n\nThen there's grand strategy games (Civ, Stellaris, etc.) where the cultural, economic, scientific, espionage and diplomatic aspects frequently feel mundane whereas combat is engaging, compelling, and just more fun. In combat you can move troops around, flank your enemies, watch huge fleet on fleet battles, watch as the city/planet succumbs to your victorious forces. Meanwhile... all the peaceful routes feel rather unceremonious and lacks that compelling edge combat provides.\n\nLastly I tried Dishonored, a Stealth game, and while it is possible to go through non violently, it definitely feels like more busy work with your limited abilities and slow chokeholds compared to the fast flowing chaotic violent route. \n\nAnd as for killing, it seems like there's only a few ways of dealing with enemy encounters. You either use a speech check, engage in combat to the death, or stealth past them. **But what about wounding the enemies and then maybe scaring them off mid fight?**\n\nBasically, **Partial Violence** (thanks, SillyConclusion0!)\n\n I find it surprising in a way that games have utterly committed and zealous NPCs who will fight to the death regardless of whether they work for a crime lord or a fascist regime. I know, it's easier to kill off entities since killing is an absolute solution. You don't have to deal with the NPC being wounded on the ground which would require some programming and quite a bit of animation work (struggling on the ground) and then if the NPCs could flee, you'd need to program the AI to do that, where to go too. And if the enemy could surrender and lay down their arms, what do you do with an enemy combatant who just surrendered? Tie them up? Send them off to a prison camp...?\n\nI know Fallout has enemies fleeing which I think is great. Unfortunately you actually lose out on Experience Points if you don't KILL the fleeing and cowering NPCs and that just seems awfully unsettling.\n\nBut yeah, I dunno, I'm a bit upset that violence seems like the main priority in games and that in a lot of games you are forced to kill NPCs when you might want to wound them or scare them off or something other than ending their (artificial) lives.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "I've recently played Far Cry 5, Dying Light, and Witcher 3 quite a bit, and something that has confused me is how people compare these titles to say, Skyrim all the time, but don't seem to pick up on something.\n\nDespite how good the open worlds may be, I don't think they're as good as Bethesda's.  I can come up with complaints for say, the Witcher 3, and a few vague statements..  but I feel like I'm having trouble articulating something.  I should probably bring these up so that they're not brought up as possible reasons why - to help reduce redundancy.\n\nWitcher 3 for instance has a lush and beautiful world with a lot of interesting locales, but the leveled enemy encounters seem spotted.  One place will have level 3 enemies near a beginning area, while a camp down the road will have level 25 enemies.  \n\nAll three of the games I've listed have problems regarding environmental interactivity.  They just have dollhouses with affixed furniture, clutter that's superglued to the place, and either NPC questgivers or loot chests.  \n\nBut Bethesda games have physics-affected clutter that are all their own entities.  This lends to make an environment more real, since this clutter can be arranged to show each place having a unique personality.  \n\nThere's also how Bethesda Games's maps aren't tailor made for the games.  It feels like you're exploring a world, not a theme park.  Each NPC has an actual schedule, truly making the places they inhabit feel alive.\n\nNot to mention the great environmental storytelling that's offered.  Fallout 4, for instance, had many flaws..  But in my opinion, it had the richest world design we've ever had.  There are so many stories that a player isn't dragged through, and they must instead search themselves.  If only some of these were made into proper quests, then the game wouldn't have felt so unfinished.  \n\nAll that said, I feel like it isn't enough to illustrate my full emotions on the matter.  All of these points contribute, but I feel like none of them by themselves explain why I feel the way I do.  And it seems to go beyond the sum of its parts, too.  Is there some quality that I'm unable to pick out?\nAnd before anyone claims this, I know bethesda games have a great number of flaws.  I'm just talking about one of their greatest strengths that neither I nor anyone else can seem to articulate.",

        "text": "Every time a \"hidden gems\" or \"most overlooked/underrated games\" lists comes up on big sites, it's usualy very uninteresting because it's always the same games (think The World Ends With You, Skies of Arcadia, that kind of stuff). Well, here's an actual hidden gem then - maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but I *never* see anyone talking about **Puppeteer, on the PS3**.\n\nIt's a 2D platformer, but the entire game is framed like a play. Levels are called \"Curtains\", there's an audience that applauds and gasps to events in the story, there's a narrator throughout the entire adventure... It sounds silly, but the game takes that theme and just runs with it.\n\nSimply put, the amount of charm and creativity oozing from this game is absurd. First off, the writing and localization are surprisingly good for a \"small\" game. The plot itself is nothing you haven't seen before, but it has this wonderful adventure/fairytale vibe. Fourth wall breaking is abundant, and that's the biggest source of laughs and giggles. Sometimes, there's bantering between the narrator and the characters. At one point, the narrator starts rooting for the boss you're facing (a giant robot), because, according to him, he just \"nerds out around robots\".\n\nThen at one point, this \"bee\" comes out, and it's just the game's big bad in a ridiculous bee costume. One of the characters then complains that the casting is lame, while the narrator nervously tries to introduce this \"sweet bee\".\n\nThere's also little details, like people in the audience coughing if you leave the game in the pause screen for long enough.\n\nThere's 21 levels, divided in 7 acts, with 3 levels each. Doens't sound like much, but every level is this game is designed like a \"setpiece\", and they each feel grand, like they're actually part of this huge adventure, even when it's just your ordinary \"go right to advance\". The soundtrack helps in this grand adventure feel, it's a fully orchestrated, well-composed OST that perfectly fits each moment of the game.\n\nOf course, it's not flawless. While good-loking, this game is visually \"busy\", and your character doesn't stand out. I died a few times because I lost track of where I was. The controls are also unlike most platformers, they're pretty floaty. If you ever played LittleBigPlanet, it's almost exactly like that. I don't mind it, but I know some people can't stand that.\n\nBut please, even if you're turned off by floaty controls, give this game a shot. It's a crime that nobody ever mentions it, but I blame Sony - it came out in 2013, very close to the PS4 release, and should have been a crossgen title. This game would've stand out like crazy in the early years of the system. Instead, Sony released it to die on the PS3 (forgot to mention it's a first-party title developed by their Japan Studio).\n\n**tl;dr: Puppeteer is a first-party PS3 game that's unbelievably charming and more people should know about. Rarely do I stumble upon an actual hidden gem, but this is one of them**",

        "text": "I just finished playing Far Cry 2 again last weekend, and it reminded me why it's my favorite game in the series. While the subsequent games had trouble deciding whether they wanted to be lighthearted or gritty and immersive, Far Cry 2 picked the latter and stuck with it. Conversations between guards were interesting, and due to the excellent sound design and lack of subtitles in minor dialogue they felt organic.\n\nThe minimalist HUD, excellent weapons, limited resources, and presentation of objectives and companions was also great at immersing the player in the game's environment. Sneaking through the jungle, hearing guards mention your name in fear, combined with the journal entries and buddy systems made you feel like a real badass mercenary in a foreign land. It also made toying with enemies psychologically more fun and natural. Stealth is much harder than in subsequent games, but also feels more rewarding (which is saying a lot since the newer games generally already have pretty satisfying stealth). Destructibility, extremely limited resources (especially on higher difficulties) and the general style of play felt rewarding and immersive.\n\nIn Far Cry 4, if I want to go to an enemy outpost to take it I simply mark it on my map and go do it. But in FC2 I find myself planning my route, deciding which areas to avoid and which routes to take. I could take a detour to an armory or just continue on my way, knowing I might not have the right loadout for the situation. \n\nWeapon balance was excellent, and I found myself changing up my loadout frequently based on what I was doing. In FC3, I rarely found myself changing up my current loadout except to try something new or thematic, but in FC2 I was constantly switching my weapons and playstyle based on where I was going and what my objective was. Thinking of raiding a junkyard for diamonds? Take some explosives and a shotgun for close quarters. Want to infiltrate the hangar at night? Get yourself a suppressed MP5, dart gun, and grenade launcher, or if you want to be better prepared to go loud, take a silenced pistol and assault rifle or shotgun instead. Your suppressed weapon is useless in combat (one magazine might not even be able to down late-game enemies on higher difficulties) but you'll have a much more powerful primary if things go loud\n\nSniper rifles weren't the cheap game-breaking tool they were in FC4, they took decent skill to use and had serious drawbacks and strengths, plus you were giving up a primary slot forcing you to use up your secondary or tertiary for an LMG or machine pistol. The portable mortar took a lot of skill to use but was also very powerful, allowing you to essentially wipe out an enemy base with zero risk.\n\nI found myself actually worrying about conserving my ammo, especially with explosive weapons and molotovs, since they were hard to come by.\n\nHowever, the game is far from perfect. While I loved the survival elements, they could have been done more dynamically. I would have loved to see the importance of time of day and guard shifts like in MGS5. The weapon jamming was neat, but unless you were picking a gun up off the ground it was rarely an issue, especially by the late game when you could afford the reliability upgrades easily. The characters talked way too fast and the autosave system was horrendous (I remember forgetting to quicksave and losing an hour of progress just because I didn't want to wait 5 minutes for the manual save to load while I slept). AI, while pretty good and immersive, definitely had some issues. Rockets so slow it was hilarious, getting hit by a truck outta nowhere was a frequent and frustrating occurrence, some weapons (like the first 2 pistols and some of the ARs) were pointless, and enemies took too much damage on higher difficulties, breaking the otherwise excellent immersion that those difficulties provided.  Mortars and grenade launchers were a pain in the ass to deal with. The malaria, while a cool idea, was ultimately a gimmick that didn't really give me any immersion until the late game when it actually affected gameplay. Some of the guns (like the G3 and FAL) made absolutely no sense, as did the trope of having every gun in the game have a left-hand ejection port, greatly hurting the otherwise excellent models. Shotguns were pretty weak up until you got the USAS.\n\nWhile the game world was amazing, the lack of civilian NPCs save for a few locations made me feel somewhat disconnected, and the awful animal AI didn't help with this. The soundtrack, while not glaringly awful, was completely unmemorable, as were most of the locations particularly in the second half of the game.\n\nBut despite all of these problems, FC2 was the most gritty, immersive, and arguably tensest game in the series, and I would still rate it as my favorite in the franchise. Imagine if Ubisoft remade the game, factoring in some of the survival and world elements of the Metal Gear games, with modern graphics, better voice acting, and refined elements I think we'd have an excellent far cry game that would bring the franchise back to being a unique and gripping experience.

        "text": "Does AAA really mean what it has meant for the last 20 years of consoles since the days of Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII and Unreal / Quake? These titles were released as AAA single player games in the very early internet days, but now we are seeing early access AA games release and then get a full AAA treatment post release (PubG, Fortnight, League of Legends, Counterstrike etc). With the rise of these multiplayer focused games it seems the definition of AAA is no longer confined to what Ubisoft called 'finite' games a few weeks back (e.g Acreed).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nJudging by sales for AAA single player games not belonging to Rockstar or called Call of Duty one must wonder if making multiplayer AAA games is now even a choice rather than a necessity for Japanese developers like Platinum Games. Back in 2012 PG made Anarchy Reigns, their first multiplayer AAA game. It was a tight deadline but they made it work and even managed to include a decent single player campaign. If Anarchy Reigns got a follow up on PC now I think it would most likely fail though. Why? Because getting high value visibility in the multiplayer space is not as simple as making a fantastic game. Is it the result of years of forming relationships / paying a lot of cash / gaming the algorithms? I'm not sure, but do we really expect a studio like Platinum Game's to be able to succeed in this type of publishing environment? I find it sad that we live in a world where making some of the best games in the world isn't enough anymore.",
