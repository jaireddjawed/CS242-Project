My question: How should I communicate to the professors that I'm emailing their colleagues as well?\n\nMy specific situation is that I emailed a professor, Prof A, and had a great Zoom call with them about a month ago. They are taking students and we both think the research fit is great. Prof A also suggested, as a passing remark, that I can consider Prof B as a co-supervisor. I would now also like to email Prof B, and I'll be mentioning that Prof A suggested them as a co-supervisor (unless otherwise told not to do this). But how should I tell Prof A that I'm emailing Prof B? Should I even bother?\n\nIf it matters, I have outside funding. The program encourages applicants to contact professors before applying. I also posted on r/gradadmissions but thought I should ask on a sub with more professors.",

I have suffered the psychological abuse, humiliation, belittling, emails in the middle of the night, messages on my phone, stalking my social media and taunting me on front of group meeting for something personal I wrote on my social media. \n\n\nMy current research is now the second revision in the highest impact journal, the reviewers said my research topical for the field and very interesting. From the beginning I was faced with how this idea is bullshit everyone else is doing great except you in front of everyone mind you with I am the only one made to this journal ( I have evidence, emails) when I got this far they were shocked, they helped nothing although we set the problem from the beginning, they didnot expect the solution I don’t know we have meetings two times in a month and always explain, I don’t know what else I should done.\n\nThere is always nothing enough for them, stealing my work and presenting as if it is their in the conference I was furious.\n\nNow I have data for another design they want to publish and it could has a potential and this current paper that’s journal be submitted again for the journal.\n\nThe last straw was when I was at my holiday and doing scientific activities has nothing to do with my research whatsoever, I have been doing it before joining for couple of years. This activity gives me connections with top researchers, companies, and it gave me a lot of opportunities in weekends, evenings, for my supervisor they don’t believe in evening or weekends and work always.\n\nWhile I was in the event they were furious that I was in a big event and got a lot of attention. When I confronted that this has nothing to do with research they stopped and waited four days and send a message humiliate me again that I am not good enough and there are doubts blah. I will not go more on this because it is extremely toxic and demoralising. I was hospitalised at the beginning of the year because of panic attack, and although it is psychological, my heart became affected. I talked to ombudsman and nothing happen.\n\nI secured a job in industry which I enjoy but deep down I would feel failure to quit but I would never want this person to be my supervisor and I want to change them but this tricky in my university.\n\n\nThey are extremely aggressive and I am afraid about myself, the dispute would be on data, how can I take them if I am the the one who came up with these ideas.\n\nIf I failed to change them I have no option rather than quit I cannot stand them anymore the thought of opening emails or my phone it terrify me to the point I bought a new phone. I just cannot it killing me and my spirit.\n\nI would appreciate to know if it is right to contact the editor and let them to know the situation. If I quit eventually how to overcome the fear of failure, I want to prioritise my health, also I am not in twenties anymore, doing this all over again isnot appealing.\n\nI love research but I feel shame about my situation",

        "text": "Hi, so I'm a prospective postgraduate looking to finish my undergrad very soon. My main interest as of now is in the cognitive science of culture, particularly in language (the Whorfian hypothesis and all that).\n\nSince I am quite enchanted by the theme already, I thought that I specialize very early starting from my masters or doctoral education. But I thought that super early specialization in this niche topic might harm me in the future career-wise (especially in my country), so I'm thinking of focusing on general cognitive neuroscience instead and hope that it have enough transferrable skills for future specialization.\n\nYet I do think that if I work to specialize very early I might get better admission chances, better performance in grad school, and get highly focused education to dive deep into the topic. Also, I have a much much bigger passion for this specific topic instead of cognitive neuro in general.\n\nIn the end I'm still leaning towards not specializing early, though I'm still really upset. But what are you professors' take on it? How do you weigh the pros and cons of early specialization?",

This is considered cheating on our student handbook but she didn’t go into detail about the exam. Just said to know the labs (which the professor told us during lecture), and animal bites aren’t in the exam (the professor told us on our question day that she won’t ask about them). I remember starting this conversation and just asking how hard it was and how they broke up the exam since 23 ?’s were over 5 PowerPoints that had over 50 slides. The teacher later told us that they would be broken up evenly so basically the girl reiterated what the professors said. Didn’t really tell us anything helpful or new. Another girl asked her how they asked questions and she said it was similar to the other two exams we’ve previously taken.\n\n• We we’re sitting in the nurses station talking about how our teacher reacted to some peoples kahoots username. Her teaching style and how we feel about it.\n\n• Again sitting in the nurses station talking about food and everything under the sun.\n\nThe girl who told us about the exam didn’t get an email. The dean is having all three of us come in at the same time after our exam. The dean also said it shouldn’t take longer than 15 minutes.\n\nI also wanna add that we were sitting at the nurses station because our nurses we were shadowing were documenting and eating. We were busy af during the beginning of our clinical rotation. We weren’t just sitting there the entire time.\n\nI’m nervous bc idk what the clinical site could have called about and complained about. \n\nI’m thinking they’re going to suspend or expel us but why would the dean let us take our exam?

That’s why I’m concerned.\n\nEither way, I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I need a backup plan or two.

While much of the program is online, there is a residency requirement of 6 months for the duration of the program. \n\nThere are 2 reasons I want to do the program online. First is cost. It will be significantly more cost effective for me to stay at the uni where I am currently teaching and do the PhD part time. The second is access to research participants. Because I’m teaching at a uni abroad and the students are the target demographic for my research, having immediate access to this target demographic will be logistically much easier than if I’m in the UK. We all know how difficult it can normally be to find participants. \n\nAll that said, I’m a little worried about how a part time and partially online degree will be viewed by employers once I graduate. Or will they care more about my publications and prior experience? Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

I have a Master's in Natural Resource Management and now just about 3 years of work experience, with 2 years working at a non-profit before this.\n\nSince I graduated, most of my work days have been either searching for academic papers, reading academic papers, writing synthesis reports and literature reviews on a bunch of papers or contributing to and writing academic papers.\n\nAnd honestly: for the incredible amount of valuable research in environmental, geo and climate science I scour everyday, only a tiny fraction of it seems to really be used, implemented, applied, etc. I am starting to go crazy with the world of academia and research institutes, where the primary measure of \"impact\" is simply how many citations a researcher has on their papers, how much press coverage their last article got, or how many government funded projects a department has received in the past year. It's like nobody is paying attention to whether any of it is ACTUALLY USEFUL, or even understandable to the outside world.\n\nLike \"hey, has anyone checked to see if any of our local governments have actually applied the findings in that last paper on the nitrogen cycle to the upcoming discussions on agricultural subsidies?\" \"Has anyone actually talked to local city officials about the latest paper on the heat island effect and asked them what they're going to do to implement some of the recommendations?\"\n\nThe answer is usually something vague about scheduling a \"workshop\" or a \"webinar\", but little else. Because that's not our job, we just \"research\", we just \"present findings\". And after so much resentment towards this building up in me, I've realized the problem isn't that the work itself is bad, the problem is that maybe I'm just not cut out for the work.\n\nI've realized I need to DO something. I need to APPLY things to the real world. I've thought for a while that I might like working in local/city government actually taking findings from research and applying them to local environmental issues and communities.\n\nWhich got me wondering: is it actually part of policymakers' job to just read new research and determine how they can apply it to policies? Does such a job exist in governments (local or otherwise) where someone is literally just paid to comb through new research and determine what findings can be applied to local problems, at what cost and what would be the trade-offs? From where I'm sitting in academia, it certainly doesn't seem like it given the limited interaction my department seems to have with anything related to policy, but maybe we're just really that isolated.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for such jobs, either you already work in one or know of an example of one, I would really love to hear it. I feel in desperate need of some inspiration so I don't end up hating working in this field.",

        "text": " Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I'm in my 2nd year of a Humanities MA.\n\nI've always intended to make the jump from MA to PhD. When I started in this program, I made my interest clear to the faculty I wanted to work with. I also made sure to ask about letters of rec early, since I have two classes + a teaching load of 50 students this semester and knew I would be busy down the road. I'll admit, I haven't had the easiest semester due to financial and personal crisis that dotted the first three months of the semester. I didn't have time to start on my SOP and writing sample revisions until early October.\n\nNothing *seemed* to be wrong though and I caught up with my tasks: my professors who are writing letters were all supportive. That is, except for my advisor. I'm currently taking their class and revising a previous paper as a unilateral seminar paper/writing sample/final defense project. They're a \"tough-but-fair\" type. Our communication throughout the semester has been okay, I worked to set perimeters for the projects early (these writing pieces weren't urgent, according to our earlier meetings), but my advisor become harder to reach until October. \n\nWe've gone back and forth on edits with the SOP and writing sample, but oftentimes, it takes a week+ for a draft to come back with a just few corrected typos or grammar issues (often ones my professor has added in earlier edits). By this time, I'd already made major changes to the content of the writing, and their feedback didn't apply anymore. I'm very busy most weeks, but tried to keep them in the loop. The SOP is now finished at least.\n\nI suspected from the tone of their emails that they were growing a bit annoyed with edits: this came to a head this week when I was called to their office and royally chewed out for \"poor time management.\" They had suddenly changed their expectations and wished I had finished my revisions in September, and had read all of the literature they assigned in the class \"for my paper\" much earlier, since I was \"wasting their time.\" There were a lot of airing grievances that had nothing to do with the paper: they were upset I was late to class twice (no fault of my own btw: I had my required language exam and a meeting that went over, which I had explained beforehand). They wished I'd asked their permission before joining some graduate extracurriculars, they were unhappy with the questions I'd asked one of our class visitors. They felt these things were \"warnings\" about potentially unprofessional behavior. I came away from the meeting in tears and felt blindsided by their behavior.\n\nWe still have a plan for revision- that hasn't changed, but when I mentioned starting my applications and sending my CV so that they might start their letters early, my advisor looked baffled. I left our conversation with no concrete timeline for their letter, and whether they were even writing one now. \n\nI plan to follow up soon, but am at a bit of loss on what to do/say. I have a few other professors who have offered letters, so I am not without support, but I felt unwell at the prospect of not having my advisor/major professor write for me. Should I even ask for a letter at this point?",

I met with the girls to discuss topics like “how people make friends in college”. We then privately filled out a questionnaire on the other two girls with questions like “would you want to be friends with them” and “do you think this person is popular”. We were then given the results about ourselves that the other two participants rated us on. The other two girls concluded that I did not seem like a nice person, they did not think I was popular and that they did not want to be friends with me. It was rough. \n\nThe proctor called me nine months later and debriefed me on the study. It was at that point when she informed me that it was an exclusion study to see the effects of cortisol for women under a stressful social situation. The other two girls were “in” on the experiment and their reviews on me were negative in order to see if my pH would change if I was in a stressful situation. \n\nParticipating in this study and not being debriefed immediately has caused lasting damage to me over the past 15 years. \n\nUpon reflection and discussion with others, I question the ethics of this study. I am looking for some feedback from those is the field of research and psychology to see if a debrief period with this gap is standard? I understand that the researcher did not want to immediately debrief me in fear of me telling others who could potentially take part in the study, but this just seems very off to me?

I relied on some data generated by a previous student, so myself, him, and our PI are the only authors on the manuscript. My PI suggested that I send it to this 2nd author for review/editing/comments, and then a couple of other colleagues in the lab for internal review before the PI reads it himself.\n\nThe first round goes great and my 2nd author returns great comments after a week worth of 2 back and forth. I proceed to send it to the next person, who's a post-doc turned research associate - too long of a tenure as a post-doc, he had to switch to being an RA. I get my comments back from the RA and I see that he has added himself as an author on my paper. I looked through the document and the comments/edits he's suggesting aren't any better/more thorough than what my 2nd author did. Mostly grammar/language and \"cite this please\" sort of commentary. I never discussed adding him as another author on my paper and I wasn't aware he was going to do it. From going through the document several times, I am also likely going to reject many of the edits as I don't think he fully grasped my paper and some of the comments are more confusing than helpful.\n\nI haven't told my PI yet and I'm unsure if he has looked at the document. From my personal knowledge, this being my first first-author manuscript, a person has to provide data for a figure or provide some extensive technical skill (bioinformatics, surgery) to receive authorship ... though I know this is also journal-dependent. I've reviewed/edited manuscripts from colleagues and other people on the floor before and never asked nor was offered to be an author. I am a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th author on several papers and for all of them I personally did work and provided data for a figure or several to guarantee authorship.\n\nIs this normal to grant authorship to somebody because they reviewed/edited a manuscript during internal review? Especially when this wasn't discussed before and the reviewer in question simply put their name on the manuscript without consent.",

Although this was my first choice in this university, I had thoughts of shifting after the previous semester but I thought that maybe I just had difficulties because my first year was purely conducted online and this year wasn’t, so I thought that maybe, I could give it a go.\n\nI wasn’t one of the bright or skilled students when it comes to programming and I’m well aware that I am way behind other students. I retook one major class and I barely passed calculus on my first year. Right now I already sent an email to one of my professors how I was having doubts and uncertainties about myself and my career path. I also emailed to schedule an appointment for guidance counseling since I feel so lost, I really do. I just feel disappointed at myself.\n\nMaybe I just wanted to vent out a little bit since I do not have a “support group” in college.

        "text": "I recently looked at my Google Scholar and noticed a new citation on one of my journal articles (published in 2019). It led me to a recently submitted PhD thesis at a top institution in the US (top 10). The person's site of study is similar to my own PhD (finished in 2021 from a top UK university), but the topic is different and in a different field (though both are in the social sciences).\n\nSo I went through the thesis and this person cited me in a few places without quotes, but I noticed that at least 4 pages altogether have been taken from my published journal article as well as my thesis (available from my university repository, if requested) word for word. The person did not even care to change my British spelling to her American one (which features in the rest of the thesis). \n\nI noticed also that she copy/pasted my entire Bibliography in its exact same formatting and simply added and removed references relevant to her topic, though the bulk of the references are mine - in my exact formatting. She also used my exact font, which is neither Times or Ariel or those generic ones. What really bothers most even more than the blatant word for word plagiarism is that she copied the EXACT style of my writing, the way I introduced and concluded chapters, and even copied my style of description and imagery - for example, if I used certain phrasing to explain how I reached the site of study (it's an ethnography so the description is quite vivid), she also used similar phrasing. The way I explained my positionality, she somehow also found a way to similarly explain hers. The topic may be completely different, but the nuances of my writing style have been copied completely. \n\nI'm just completely shocked and appalled that such a top institution doesnt use Turnitin minimay for PhD theses?! Because if they did it would pick that 4 whole pages have been lifted from my published work. I've contacted the university's Student Conduct office, but do you think I have a case even though the actual plagiarism is only 4 pages out of 100? When I write my complaint report, can I add in points about copying my Bibliography word for word and copying the style of my writing?\n\nIs it even worth putting in a complaint? I feel disgusted by this person, especially since they've now gotten a prestigious postdoc fellowship and I'm sure will continue to advance well in their career with a PhD from a top institution. \n\nWould love to hear any thoughts and advice.",

        "text": "Hello all. Posting from a throw-away account.\n\nI need some advice with my situation, please.\n\nI am a female brown post-doc currently in, what I perceive to be, a very hostile lab environment in the US. In the last one year that I’ve been in the lab, there have been several incidents of name-calling, bullying, racist and sexist aggressions, yelling, condescending comments, etc. Most of these are from a brown male PhD student, who acts respectfully with White people in the lab, but is very derogatory when it comes to dealing with me. Some of the condescending remarks are also from a White male postdoc. \n\nI have complained to the lab PI twice, both times through email, and he’s been supportive and has dealt with this by asking said student to take training modules to overcome implicit racial biases, etc. (but interestingly, no action was taken with the postdoc) This has decreased the overt aggressive behavioral issues from the PhD student, however, now I’m being subject to covert passive-aggressive behaviors from him – i.e. dramatic sighing and eyerolls when I enter the lab space, shutting me down in group meetings whenever I make a comment or ask questions (and nobody – not even the PI – intervenes and asks him to stop), addressing and making eye contact with everybody in the lab but me – i.e. giving me the silent treatment as a form of “punishment” for complaining to the PI, and waiting for opportunities for me to make mistakes to sneer at, ridicule, or outright demean. The postdoc continues bullying and using condescending language on a daily basis. This has increased to a point where I find myself avoiding going to the lab space during normal work hours. But this comes at a cost to my productivity, collaboration with other folks in the group (and they understandably don’t want to take sides or participate), and my overall mental health is being slowly destroyed.\n\nThe PI is supportive in private, but whatever he’s doing isn’t helping in a major way. Plus, he’s a “nice” guy – won’t confront anybody for anything ever. So whatever micro/macro-aggressions take place in group meeting settings or in the lab is neglected, unless I complain. And I’m not sure if I should keep complaining. At this point, I feel like I am the “trouble-maker” because nobody else has a problem, and I’m the only one who’s subject to this behavior.\n\nAnd hence, I’m looking for advice. As I see it, I have the following options –\n\n1. Complain to the PI yet again – and be the trouble-maker? \n\n2. File an official complaint to HR/DEI Office? Talk to the University Ombuds? \n\n3. Ignore the behavior, focus on my exit strategy, and move to another work environment? I have been here a year, and after a whole bunch of delays and equipment failures, I’m on the verge of getting good data and 2-3 high impact publications. Plus, my projects involve other PhD students from other Universities, and I don’t want to leave them hanging, especially since they’ve put a lot of effort in our projects together. Finalizing data, analyses, and writing up the manuscripts to submit will take another 5-6 months at minimum. So I’d want to be here at least until then. \n\nAt the moment I’m inclined towards option 3 and will consider option 2, if needed. I’m truly perplexed as to how to deal with this situation without going crazy. I have never encountered anything like this in my PhD and workplace before. Any advice will help.\n\nThank you all, so much!",

I graduated from undergrad in 2020 and ended up moving back in with my parents and, due to the pandemic, quarantining almost the next two years. During this time, my mental state became very very bad; I will spare you details but things became seriously scary. However, things have been improving exponentially since the beginning of 2022, as my period of isolation is over and I've been seeking treatment. Things are miles better now than they were at the beginning of the year.\n\nI've also just started a PhD program this fall, and it's become clear to me that my ability to function is still not all the way back to where it was. I've been missing a fair number of classes and have also had a few homework assignments late. Right now it doesn't seem like this will affect my grades, though I'm worried it might. I have talked to my professors and they've all been very understanding, but I feel as though there is something I've been unable to properly convey: that I really have great confidence that this is temporary. As I said, my improvement has been really steady for almost a year now, and the cause of this whole thing was the very aberrant conditions of the pandemic, which (I hope) will not be repeated. I expect this to stop being a drain on my performance within the year (in fact within the next quarter, probably) as I adjust to being in school again and figure out how to work around the few issues I'm still having.\n\nHowever, I'm really really worried that I'm making a terrible first impression on the department. I'm in my first quarter of the program, and I'm missing many classes and struggling to get homework in on time. I feel like any outside observer would conclude that I'm just not a very good student, or not prepared for graduate study, and that this will hurt me long term.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what to do.
