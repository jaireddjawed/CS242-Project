        "text": "For those of you who don’t know, two different bakeries supply the cookies for the Girl Scouts, based on troop location. ABC Bakers and Little Brownie Bakers, and their cookie recipes are slightly different. I’m privileged enough to live in an area where I can get cookies from both bakeries, though for those of you who don’t, you can now order online from a troop serviced by the bakery of your choice.\n\nAnyway, I’ll be reviewing two cookies between the two bakeries: Thin Mints and Trefoils. \n\nThe Thin Mints between the two bakeries are very similar as far as taste goes but ABC Bakers Thin Mints are more dense while Little Brownie Bakers Thin Mints lighter and more flakey in texture and less substantial, which leaves me unsatisfied, while the ABC Bakers Thin Mints hit the spot, so I believe a far as Thin Mints go, ABC Bakers makes the superior cookie.\n\nFor Trefoils, the Trefoils from Little Brownie Bakers is thicker so is the more substantial cookie, however the Trefoils from ABC Bakers may be more buttery. This taste difference is slight enough for me to not particularly care though and unlike with the Thin Mints, I could happily make due wit Trefoils from either bakery.",

No idea why they are even friends. \nBasically, in the canteen, minding my own business, and a wild vegan appears. \nStarts scolding me and looking at me with one of the most contemptuous gazes I've ever seen, as if I was doing the stupidest things ever.\nIn her words, people who eat meat shouldn't be eating vegan food, and that eating vegan food along with meat is being disrespectful to vegans. While I was eating and staring at her(i was mildly interested in what she was preaching about), for around half an hour she had been there just talking to me about it while I nodded and continued to eat the tofu and meat on my plate. \nI hit her back with a \"sooo I can't eat vegetables?\"\nShe responded with, \"you can eat that cus it's not vegan\"\nI wisely stopped conversing with her and went on my way, promising her that I'd never to eat tofu ever again. \n\nAll in all, a fun experience. Her satisfied look when I agreed with her made me doubt myself. Is eating tofu as an average meat enjoyer actually a disrespectful act? \nOr am I just overthinking it\nRegardless of the answer, I think I'll continue eating tofu, since it does taste good.",

I looked at miguel, and I looked at the sweater, and I realized how silly he would look in the sweater.   \nSo hes a chunker right? I don't know why honestly cuz I dont overfeed him, I wait until hes all comfy in his bed, when hes relaxed so I dont stress him out, and I slipped it over his head, and pretty painlessly he was wearing the sweater.   \nWell hes old, hes never worn a sweater (if you dont count his fur as a sweater already), so he was a tad confused at first, he kinda looked at me, then flopped over and went back to sleep. I was worried it would be tight on him, but the neck hole is large and the sweater was larger then I thought. \n\nHes snoozing now, I think he likes the sweater, he looks quite handsome. I havent taken it off him yet because hes sleeping and seems to kinda like it",

My dad made the crab cake patties and gifted them to me (he refuses to release his recipe, but they are the best crab cakes on the planet). The soup was an amalgam of different recipes, but it used a higher-grade coconut milk from my local Asian market (where it's essentially coconut fat surrounded by coconut water) as well as a dense mushroom stock concentrate and umami seasoning (powdered mushrooms and onions). I got fresh thyme and carrots from the farmer's market and found the freshest mushrooms from my local grocer.  \nI garnished my soup with thyme and garlic flatbread crackers, crushed cashews, more thyme, and vegan parmesan.  \nI've never tasted food this good in my life--and I cooked it all myself. I'm just so freaking euphoric right now.  \nI have food allergies, so eating is often a stressful chore. It's usually a process of settling or compromising. I honestly think this is one of the first times I got to have my cake and eat it when it comes to food. (And speaking of cake, I made a mostly-vegan cake as well. Dessert is going to be a vegan Ben and Jerry's paired with the cake. So excited!!) \nAnyone else recently hit a food milestone? Or, if nothing else, what's the best meal you've ever had?",

It's difficult to influence other persons actions, but you can choose to rise above your frustration and go within and find peace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've learned to simply pretend the other person is Vader and I'm Luke.  I do worry if I'm being presumptuous trying to be Luke, I mean \\*I\\* trying to be Luke?  But, I tell myself have some confidence, why not?  Everyone can be Luke.  We are all meant to be great. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a long time I was getting frustrated at someone in my personal life, but now I've realized it's because I'm shackled in my own expectations that this person is great, that I forgot that this person is only human, and to err is human.  I've been putting this person on a pedestal, and followed them, and they kept applauding me.  Once, I did something that bothered them, and from then on they've been so angry at me all the time, and I couldn't stand to see the perfect image that I had in my mind of them shatter.  \\*I\\* was frustrated, which made \\*me\\* angry.  For a long time, I kept being angry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, I've realized that I have to let go of it.  I can't change them. Atleast not today itself.  But, I can change myself.  It is very very difficult for me to accept that they are not perfect, for it leaves a big gaping hole in me, losing my idol! I just have to face the loss for now.  I am learning that I have to rise for them, I have to become the idol that they have been for such a long time for me, and pull them out from the dark side they have fallen into. And I need confidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will stop here, I'm rehashing.

While I was all about Europe is in huge debt and all other macro economic problems they have. After that I felt bad that I don’t view things like she does and am always rational and hard on myself.\n\nShe is just so happy to live an average life of joy without worrying much about achieving much in life, it kinda scares me and makes me think back on my life goals of achieving high levels of success and if it is even worth it. \n\nAs of now she is definitely a happier person than me but I don’t know what the future holds.",

        "text": "I'll try and keep this casual but know it's a bit ranty! \n\nI was diagnosed 20 years ago, nearly 40 now and I'm finally 'legally blind' and beginning to lose my hearing and have various other health issues. I also struggle a lot with depression and anxiety. I am and always have been one to keep in touch with friends and love to organise various social events. I'm at my best when surrounded by friends and loved ones. \n\nI hid my mental health issues from most of my friends for a very long time but a couple of years ago I started to share that side of me and, for the most part, the support has been mind blowing.\n\nI'm a sociable person and have a fairly large friendship circle I do my best to maintain and I'm really lucky to have any of them as friends.\n\nSadly, since being a lot more open about my mental health and how bad my eyesight and hearing has become, it feels like few of my friends are keeping their distance. \n\nI understand life gets busy, especially at this age with work and kids, some friends are totally open with the fact they are busy but do their best to turn up to gatherings and plans I make and will reach out and make plans when they can, that's all I can ever really hope for and I really appreciate seeing them when possible. \n\nThe ones keeping their distance seemed to stop asking me out to things or making plans (except the ones I organise) and I don't know if I'm just too much for them to process or if I've done something wrong that's pushed them away. Of course, they may be having their own struggles or just busy and that's totally understandable, they haven't said that's the case (again, I totally understand that opening up isn't easy). So I keep blaming myself and worrying that I've over shared or done something wrong. \n\nLosing my sight and hearing is tough going but having friendships change like this really hurts inside. \n\nI don't want to be over bearing or guilt anyone so I try my best to give people space but make sure they hear about plans I'm organising so they don't feel left out but now I'm feeling a bit left out myself. When they suggest we hang out I'm often left on read when I follow up to organise. I also try my best to make plans with different friends each time so I'm not pestering the same people over and over. \n\nIt would be selfish of me to assume I'm invited to every single thing people do, of course they can hang out with whoever they want and do what they want, that doesn't bother me. I've just noticed that these few just don't make plans me any more and that's a big change than it was just a year or two ago. Or, as I mentioned above, plans are suggested but never followed through. \n\nTrying my best to maintain these friendships and not get consumed with worry, or worse, become bitter! \n\nI wish I could let go of some of these relationships and be thankful for the friendship we've had but I always find myself, after a few months of no contact, checking in. It usually ends with some nice messages or long phone calls catching up with plans suggested, me really looking forward to seeing them and then me eventually feeling a little let down when I try and follow up to make a plan and no date suits and no alternative is given.\n\nI keep being told by my partner that I'm doing nothing wrong and I know my depression is feeding in to this but it's hard not to feel the pain inside.\n\nIt all feels rather silly at times and I know there could be a million reasons for this but as they won't/can't communicate what those are and they do act like friends when I see them, I'm left in this vicious cycle of trying to make plans and follow through with suggestions. I hate the idea that I've done something wrong or I'm making the situation worse without realising. \n\nThe stupid thing is, most of my friends aren't like this at all and will make plans when they can, so why can't I focus on those healthy relationships and stop trying to fix the relationships that currently feel 1 way or fair weather friendships?! I'd always be here if anyone wanted to reconnect.\n\nApologies for the long, tired, depressed rant... I don't expect anyone to really read all of this or have any answers! But of course, I'm open to any suggestions or thoughts! \n\nI wasn't sure if this was classed as too serious for this sub, it wasn't supposed to be but if it is, I'll happily post there instead. \n\nTake care everyone :)",

She and I are close friends but I notice that whenever she talks or laughs with another guy that she might potentially date, I feel bad and I don't really know how to explain this feeling but it's horrible. I tried digging into it to know why I feel that way and I think it my be that I don't love myself and I'm delegating that task to other people and when these people seem to not be able to give me the affection I need, I very bad. The problem is that this is not the first time that it happens, it's already occured with other girl friends I used to hang out with. The worst part is we share the classes and I'm always overthinking and following her interaction with other boys to see if anything is happening. I feel like deep down I want her to fall in love with me so that she can give me that kind of affection and attention. It's become so crazy that I even check wether other boys are online to verify if they are chatting with her. I really want to get help on this, how to solve this problem because it's starting to ruin my life. What do you think I can do to fix this problem??? \nThanks for reading.",

Now it's 2023 and my apartment wants $1,300 a month. That's it, I've officially been priced out of the place I've called home these past 3 years. \n\nEven with me paying $1,100 + utilities a month I barley have enough to get by. I'm left with no money at the end of every month. So now I have no extra money to move out and I don't know what to do. I was late for rent this month because of some car issues I had to pay for, and after paying this month's rent I have nothing left in my bank account and no food in my fridge. I have to wait until Friday to get paid so I'm going to have to give a call to my grandparents for some food.\n\nI am a bit disappointed that someone like me who works hard every day and makes a $50,000 salary can't even afford basic living and food.

I have never struggled this bad financially in my life. I've always done somewhat okay, but now my money is losing its value as the years go by. I will keep a positive mindset and grow through this. I'm entirely grateful for my good health and sharp mind. I will change my circumstances and rise above. Just wanted to share my struggles because I'm sure someone can relate.",

We'll no longer be able to create them after March 21st. I think I speak for a lot of us who joined the talks when I say this is a bummer.\n\nThe talks were so much fun. We met new people from all over the world and talked about whatever random casual topic came to mind. Although that usually meant food, movies, TV, and sports, we also delved into other areas like interesting hobbies, places we live, our pets, and lots of other things.\n\n[You can find the previous talks here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3A%3Atalk%3A%2BReddit%2BTalk#casual-friday) if you're feeling nostalgic. If that link doesn't work on mobile, try going to the search at the top of the subreddit and looking for flair:Reddit Talk\n\nIt's not over yet, though! We have a couple of weeks left, so we should be having two more Friday talks at [6 PM ET](https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter?t=6pm&amp;tz2=New-York) and two more Tuesday talks at [9 AM ET](https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter?t=9am&amp;tz2=New-York).\n\nMake sure to join us while you still can!\n\n[Schedule Graphic](https://preview.redd.it/5jxw3kinwkma1.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a6b78b8169528d152fcd17f42a171ee78df6799)",

The pleasure I got wasn't from vicariously feeling upset for the OP, nor for the morbid pleasure of watching a car crash. I was allured by the various locations being presented. There would be a highway in Texas before going to some field in Montana. There was such a breadth of diversity in the locations, and a beauty in feeling like a part of a space that isn't your own. This isn't even mentioning the beautiful sunsets, sunrises, and illuminated streets. I think that finding this kind of beauty in something meant to illicit anger is powerful, and I wanted to share that, while also inviting you all to talk about what impact you may find in things that aren't seen as a \"traditional\" source of impact.",

The last time i had this now was November, so i have no idea what sold over December/xmas, no idea of what stock i have left and also no money for the past 4 months of sales. I have messaged twice in this time to ask for an update, and each time they have said they will have a look for me next week and then i hear nothing again. I'm aware they now have a 1 year old, so this is the reason i haven't been chasing them that much as i get family life is alot when they are that age. I'm wondering how long do i leave this for? Has anyone been in the same position? I also forget to mention this shop is on the other side of the country so i cant just pop up to see them in person. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nThank you",

Those numbers that just play hold music wouldn't work in my case since the call is picked up and it gets logged and they can play it back later.

        "text": "I think this is a super individual thing, but yesterday I reflected on my relationship with money, spending etc. - I'm pretty responsible with money, but I'm making less money now (by choice, mostly - prioritizing my mental health) which means I've been extra diligent with my spending. So of course, I've had to think about what's actually worth it beyond things like rent, bills etc. \n\nSo here are a few things I purchase regularly/singular purchases I came up with that were totally worth it:\n\n* My elliptical. I got it about four years ago for around 300 euros, and damn, this thing has definitely paid itself off. Zero technical issues and I now use it at least once a week. Living in Europe, where there are more cold months than not, having a way to do cardio easily at home without making a ton of noise or hurting my knees or back has been awesome.\n* My air fryer. Honestly, best 50 euros I could have spent for my kitchen. I bought a really pretty little mini one. Never had a single issue with it, and I use it every single day. I barely even use my oven anymore. I think my loved ones are getting sick of how often I praise the damn thing.\n* YouTube Premium and Spotify subscriptions. I use both every day, multiple times a day, and the features for both are 100% worth it to me. Every time I'm with people who use the free versions, I don't understand how they tolerate it. \n* Getting groceries delivered almost exclusively. In my area, shipping is usually relatively inexpensive, and I'd rather pay and avoid the hassle, time wasting and the potential impulse purchases I do when I go in person. I have my go-to items favorited, and I add groceries throughout the week to the app to make sure I remember to buy them. Once in a while I go in person for items I can't get on there, or change up the place I order from to have more options - but on a weekly basis, this has been totally worth it. I honestly think it saves me money, because I rarely buy random shit I don't need.\n* Extra cloud storage. It syncs up everything on my computer so I never have to worry about losing precious files, which has definitely happened before. I can also easily access anything on my laptop from my phone.\n* Kindle with Kindle Unlimited. This shit SLAPS. I can get basically any book I want to read for a cheaper price and take it with me anywhere. It's light, the battery life is impressive, and dark mode is awesome at night. Plus, I have a small apartment and I don't want to clutter it with a ton of paperbacks. I love a good physical copy of a book, but realistically this has been extremely handy.\n\nWhat are some of yours? I always love hearing how people make these choices.",
