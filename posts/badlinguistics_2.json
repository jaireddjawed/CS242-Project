        "author": "toferdelachris",

        "text": "[Here's](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/guys-gender-neutral/568231/) a tough one. This is one of those scenarios where we have to recognize the near-inextricability of language from culture, and from folk understandings and perceptions of language.\n\nIt's a pretty well-written article (including some quotes from our golden boy McWhorter). It does a pretty good job of breaking down the issues at play in the grammar, concisely addressing gender-neutral \"guys\" and various second-person plurals (\"you guys\", \"y'all\").\n\nSo while there's bits that I would want to nitpick, it's mostly pretty good. But there's one part that irks me a bit.\n\nR4:\n\n&gt;perhaps the most passionate opponent of the word [\"guys\"] is Sherryl Kleinman, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In a 2002 essay in the journal Qualitative Sociology, she wrote about the problem with male-default terms such as “chairman,” “congressman,” and “mankind.” Kleinman saw them together as “another indicator—and, more importantly, a reinforcer—of a system in which ‘man’ in the abstract and men in the flesh are privileged over women.”\n\n&gt;She reserved a special disapproval for “you guys,” which she considered the “most insidious” of these phrases, and with the help of former students made a small card that anyone could print out and, for instance, leave behind at a restaurant to communicate their dislike of the term to a waiter who had used it. “When you’re talking to a group of customers, gender doesn’t really matter, so why not replace ‘you guys’ with ‘you all,’ ‘folks,’ or ‘y’all,” it reads in part.\n\n\nOn the one hand, there's at least the one small issue with a misunderstanding of etymology. Though plenty of people certainly synchronically interpret \"mankind\" as giving precedent to males, the word [\"mankind\" has its roots](https://www.etymonline.com/word/mankind#etymonline_v_31137) in the older meaning of \"man\" as a general term for \"humans\".\n\nBut, ok, fine. All native speakers must apprehend their language synchronically, and so this word seems to privilege males. But, then, we have to fairly apply this synchronic assessment to \"you guys\". Kleinmann sees \"you guys\" as the \"most insidious\" of phrases that apparently promotes men over women. Only it doesn't. Maybe I'm just grouchy because in my dialect, my whole life, \"you guys\" has been a grammatical term for second person plural. It doesn't carry gender, and never has (for me). Certainly it has a historical association with \"guy\" the gendered term, but it is now purely grammaticalized as gender neutral, for me.\n\nCertainly it can *feel* like this word privileges men over women, and that's something I want to be sensitive toward.\n\nIndeed, maybe the card they hand out isn't as bad as I at first want to gripe about.\n\n&gt;“When you’re talking to a group of customers, gender doesn’t really matter, so why not replace ‘you guys’ with ‘you all,’ ‘folks,’ or ‘y’all,”\n\nMy first thought is \"of course, I agree, gender *doesn't* matter, which is why I'm using the only gender-neutral second-person plural pronoun I possess in my native dialect.\" But, my followup thought is \"yeah, but we often have to adopt different phrases or words that are not part of our native dialect in order to learn the standard\". Honestly, again, I'm probably just complaining because I've had it relatively easy. As a white man from a dialect pretty damn close to my country's standard, I've only ever very minimally had to adapt my dialect for formal situations. Native speakers of AAVE, Southern American English, etc. -- any number of people who speak a less standard dialect -- are probably scoffing at poor old me having to adapt a few measly words to meet the standard.\n\nI know this isn't a normal sort of post for /r/badling, but I'm mostly interested in bringing in some discussion. I have a war going on inside me: one side is the linguistic side, who grouches at [edit: obstinate] prescriptivism. The other is the civil activist who hates people feeling marginalized, and who knows some of that marginalization can come from language usage.\n\nIs there some middle ground that can help educate people on linguistics, while still attempting to acknowledge that people feel marginalized, and perhaps capitulate in order to reduce marginalization (both the perception of and the real thing)?\n\nSo, thoughts?\n\n**edit:** I should also say, I think an aspect of badling or badacademia is that Kleinmann is a sociologist -- a field very closely aligned with linguistics. They even have a shared baby field together, sociolinguistics. It seems a bit disingenuous for a sociologist to not bring the linguistic aspect into the discussion. Of course that could partly be an outcome of being quoted by an outside source, but still. I suppose my opinion is that if language policing like this should happen, it should happen with a full recognition of the linguistic facts of the matter. It should be an appeal on behalf of the person who feels slighted, not on behalf of anything to do with the language or words themselves.\n\n**edit 2:** Of course I somehow missed McWhorter's response, which basically sums up my feelings on the linguistics side of things:\n\n&gt;McWhorter, though, would not bet on the reformers in this guys debate. He thinks that the gender-neutral guys has irreversible momentum. The question then becomes, he says, “How do we feel about it? And we can express our feelings, but if you don’t want to say it, use folks or people, but everybody's not going to join you. Language changes whether you like it or not.\"",
