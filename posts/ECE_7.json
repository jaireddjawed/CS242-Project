Currently, I'm a MS ECE student with \\~3 years experience combined prior to my graduation of full time + internship experiences at a few different companies. I worked full time for a bit between my BS and MS in semiconductors in an engineering role, but unrelated to current roles in terms of job responsibilities.\n\n* Large semiconductor company (i.e one of the big ones ADI/Maxim/TI/NXP/Microchip etc.). This is an analog IC design role. Located in high cost of living area (HCOL). Expected total compensation is \\~180K with salary + bonuses\n* Consumer electronics (i.e FAANGs/Big Tech). This would be a board level design role with a focus on RF. Located in HCOL area. Offer still TBD.\n\nI'm curious to see if anyone has insights on board vs. IC level design roles in terms of career opportunities. I've also heard it's easier to transition from IC level design to PCB level design versus the other way around. I'm interested in both domains so having the option to explore both domains over the course of my career is something I am considering. \n\nIn addition, if anyone has worked in these kinds of companies and/or similar roles, I was wondering what pros and cons you have seen/experienced and any recommendations/advice for someone still fairly new.

I'm excited to do this, and I know for sure that I will work hard to get a return offer after my graduation. However, I don't want to stay an AE and will look to land a design position or transfer internally within my company. The specifics of the role aren't too clear, but I was told during the interviews and the job posting is that I'll mainly be learning to use my companies tool suites in regard to HDL, synthesis and timing, PnR, PD, and verification. \n\nAbout me:\n\n* B.S in CE graduating next winter\n* 1 prior FPGA internship this past summer\n\nHere are some routes I've thought about:\n\n1) Intern, work hard for full time return. Accept return, pursue M.S in the area (bay area) and eventually pivot to design. \n\n\\- **Pro**: income + experience while I pursue my M.S. \n\n\\- **Con**: Work + School. I heard more years as an AE makes it harder to get out.\n\n2) Intern, interview after my internship for design jobs. \n\n\\- **Pro**: design right out of graduation \n\n**- Con**: Might be more difficult without an M.S\n\n3) Intern, do a full-time M.S program after. \n\n**- Pro**: Easier to finish M.S within 2 years\n\n\\- **Con**: Not working, full time school.\n\n4) Intern, work hard for full time return, and internal transfer to design\n\n\\- **Pro**: income while I learn on the job\n\n\\- **Con**: I heard more years as AE makes it harder to get out. Unsure of internal transfer difficulty.\n\nSince I was I'm going to be getting familiar with these tools, I was thinking about PD as a career, but unsure if PD engineers with a BS are common. FPGA design was okay as I did one this summer, but I want to explore options. \n\nI like to think I'm a strong planner, so having an idea of where I can take my career and think about trade-offs helps me stay on track of my goals.

Normally I clean the solder pads with 90% isopropyl, use bismuth solder paste and hot air or reflow oven for fine pitch components. Just want to make sure that I am doing things the right way.\n\nI am looking around and found this [https://www.ipc.org/ipc-certifications](https://www.ipc.org/ipc-certifications) This appears to be the trusted and standard certification. I see that several technical schools near me offer certifications, some are IPC certified, others are just certifications from the school.\n\nWould anyone be able to just give me some insight if I am on the right path in pursuing an IPC certification? Or should I just make sure I follow the available soldering information I can find online?",

But i am kind of lost as i don't know how to job hunt when it comes to control engineering .\n\n1. What kind of job roles we have?\n2. What kind of skills are required(technical)?\n3. What (kind) companies hire control engineers??\n\nI did searched robotics however that was more oriented towards software side. I don't mind software but idk i am more leaned to hardware.\n\nPS: I am in India. Indian job market is just either medical,business or software. Large numbers of engineers also go to software so i have my eyes on Canada. Germany as well .\n\nSo any advice,criticisms are most welcomed on how do i kickstart my career in this domain.",

I made a 2nd one without some of the extra parts and no resistors, and replaced all the current mirrors with sources, now my open loop gain is around 15k and rail to rail is where it should be.... I'm so confused, is there something about resistors that multisim doesn't like when worked with these high gain circuits? Or is there something else that could be causing it to simulate different than it should be doing?",

I was hired as an electrical engineer, but they never given me any design work yet. I am trying to learn design work on my own. My boss (lead engineer) kept ignoring my design requests for a while (requested **at least 15 times so far** and kept lying or ignoring my reqs). Boss kept telling me don't worry you need to first do/finish this or that projects first or learn this or that products we build. As of now, I have tested (directly and successfully) all our major products and still my boss hasn't given me any design work and keeps changing topic when I try to bring design or anything else to the convo. I have given up on asking for design work at my current job.\n\nI think it's because I finish all my work/projects before deadline, and I am making a lot of profit for my employer (project manager told me that I am making a lot of profit). That's why they are reluctant to give me any design work (**that's my honest guess**). \n\nPlus **my salary is not that good either**. It is around **60k-ish which is easily on the bottom levels in my state/area** (Googled)\n\n**How can I learn design work on my own? What tools to do need (software experience)? how do I approach it? How can I advance my career?** \n\nI am totally seeing dead-end at my position (**small RF manufacturing company with &lt;50 employee**; no growth at my position) and I am not sure how can I get those experience to make myself more valuable for a better opportunity. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for your time.",

I'm currently working with a professor on a research paper for an electronic device he recently fabricated to imitate braille coding, and he tasked me with building a networked frontend for it, connecting the device to a signal translator, and an assembling peripheral on a scientific computer. Then from the scientific computer, I use regression algorithms to process the data, and then publish them. For extending functionality, we are now making a app-based frontend to use the device by making a reverse network, to give a virtual input for a response, in comparison to a manual one. While I have soldered the connections and the device is functional, I'm not completely understanding what I'm doing and just \"following instructions.\" He gave a lot of resources, but I'm tired of bugging a singular source. The IoT \"course\" at my university is useless and doesn't give any insights at all.\n\n\nI am kinda screwed for deadlines as the prof is expecting me to write a competent summary and research paper within the timeframe of 5 months, so that PhDs can gloss over it and make improvements/changes, to be publish-ready by June. I already have written the Regression part as I was part of publishing 2 papers during the past year based on ML but since IoT is completely new to me I have practically no idea what to write. My own notes about why I have connected what and what's their use is a bunch of gibberish and incoherent sentences which would mean nothing to a common person reading them.\n\n\nSo my request is to read/watch resources which can teach me about various connections and integrations in a way not very simple, so that I can write it in a research paper. I don't want a \"watered down\" explanation, but I also am screwed for time, because missing the deadline would make me miss out on obtaining a LoR from this guy, who seems like a very cool dude but is extremely particular about deadlines and discipline.",

        "text": "So I have a big LED driver/ballast transformer *thing*. It’s *supposed* to output 24V at a max of 4.16A (100 watts even). It was working just fine last week. Throw it in my car, drive six hours, and now… it doesn’t! No idea why - but it only outputs 20V. There’s an adjuster pot on the side that, according to my DMM, can make it output between ~19 and ~21V (now).\n\nHuge pain - and I’d really rather not buy another transformer! They’re expensive! So my question is this. I’ve also got a 5V 20A transformer. Which is also 100 watts max. If I plug both transformers into the wall (separate cords and whatnot), turn the 24-turned-20 volt one down to 19V, and join them in series, would it be okay to power my LED lights with them?\n\nI’m very familiar w/ electronics but my coursework stopped just short of power electronics (CompE). My concern is either that I may blow something up (I’ve never tried wiring transformers in series before) and/or the power won’t be clean enough for LEDs. Does anyone have any insight into this? Any help is much appreciated!!",

For my technical growth I think SpaceX or Anduril are best.\n\nAt SpaceX, though it has more name recognition outside of defense compared to Anduril, I am concerned about the work-life balance (I don't want to burn out by working 11 hour days lol). I am also concerned about being too in-over-my-head for my position, having not taken many RF, digital, or analog design classes yet.\n\nThis is of course assuming that Anduril doesn't also have similar issues with work-life balance -- this would also be great to hear about if anyone has experience with the company.\n\nI guess I would most appreciate if anyone could speak to their experience with balancing technical growth vs. work-life balance for an internship, along with the value of name recognition of SpaceX vs. Anduril for future EE internships.\n\nIf it helps at all, I plan to get my MSEE after my undergrad.

The locations are San Jose and Dallas, but I don't think it's that important since it's only for three months.\n\nI would like to end up as a digital VLSI or ASIC design engineer somewhere like AMD, Nvidia, or Intel etc etc. The roles in both positions are very similar. Would either of these companies be a better choice for my career path?\n\nThanks for the help!!",

        "text": "I am a first-year Masters student in a small predicament right now. I recently received an SoC DV Intern offer from Apple. On the flip side, I have a **return offer** from another well-known EE company. While I was there, I was on their DV team, which does both pre and post-silicon verification work and emulation. However, my main intern project while I was there was tooling (didn't learn much DV).\n\nPart of the issue is that I don't know if I want to do DV and am nervous about getting stuck in it. All my interviews this fall have been with DV teams.\n\nThe Apple team told me that I would be assigned some project that would have a \"real impact\"  on their team and be important (typical things said for intern projects). Apple's offer is about 35% more, and I imagine they pay better full-time. The company I interned at previously, knowing that I would be interested in other disciplines, said I could join any pre-silicon team I wanted, from system design to IP and rtl to physical design.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just looking for advice on things to consider in this decision. I'm inclined to take the Apple offer, just to experience a new company and get to work on Apple's ARM chips. However, the other company is offering me a chance to choose what discipline I focus on for the summer, and do something other than DV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Still talking to past company so don't really want to say who.*",

I just graduated with a bachelors in EE, but I feel like I don’t have as much hands on skills nor do I feel super confident. If there is a better idea to implement similar to this, I’d love the suggestion as well!",

I'm not really into DSP and data processing so I would like to know to general idea behind it, not the real implementation with optimization etc; so, for the sake of question, let's suppose all the subcarriers of the OFDM carry data bits.\n\nLe'ts say that the modulation scheme is 16QAM. The \"symbol mapping\" block maps block of 4 bit into a carrier, performing also a I/Q separation. 2 bits rappresent the quantized amplitude of I, and the other 2 bits rappresent the quantized amplitude of Q. \n\nThus for a N subcarrier system modulated with 16QAM, there is N parallel 2-bit stream for I and another N parallel 2-bit for Q. These enters in two IFFT with N symbol imput, one for I and another one for Q.\n\nHoping that what's I wrote until now is correct, I'm missing the exact input of IFFT. I have the general knowledge that it's a N input, but I'm missing how the exact inputs look like, starting from the aforementioned streams.\n\nFor example, for LTE 20 MHz BW I read that the N=2048. I still don't get why, since for 20 MHz the subcarrier is 100. \n\nPerhaps the sinx/x quantized function in the spectrum is in the memory of the DSP and the input bit just retrieve them?\n\nI'm having an headache on this so please help me, a numerical example with LTE number would be appreciated, for example a derivation on how 2048 is obtained. \n\nThanks!",
