The plan I came up with may work due to how humanity acts under harsh conditions. The plan is to leave earth through a rocket launcher similar to how a railgun is launched- through magnetic propulsion. A suitable area for this trek is Europa as it has many large bodies of water which can also be used for distilled fuel and the rings of the planet itself have traces of nitrogen and methane inside with some carbon . this is a perfect condition for life to exist if we harvest it correctly . Nitrogen and methane are used by methanogens and plants for fuel which then provide oxygen ",

Some all-naturalistic groups (mostly those, interested in alternative medicine and herbal remedies with an overall dismissive attitude towards conventional medicine) might choose to maintain an all natural lifestyle and refuse to fuse with machines or genetically enhance their bodies/minds. What would these individuals' place be in a transhuman/post-human society? Will they be affected by the Singularity at all? Will a full-blown segregation between transhumans and \"naturals\" occur? Or will they become more of a strange, fringe group, similar to the Amish? If a \"natural\" makes the choice to rejoin the mainstream society, would he/she be even able to function without being augmented? Will a transhumanist government deliberately pass laws against such folks and force augmentation on them? Or will it consider them a \"visible minority\" and give them a certain protected status? What do you think might happen?  ",

        "text": "Hi, I am mostly an outsider. Just want to get a more \"expert\" opinion on some writing I'm doing. My goal is not necessarily to address what is possible or not possible but address the implications of transhumanism if it is possible. Also if anyone has a synthetic Biology background I would like to hear what you think about the possibility of implanting bioreactors inside of our body that generate our food sources from algae and sunlight, and decomposes into food.\n\n\nFor the history of civilization there are certain ideas and concepts that we\nhave become accustomed to. We've come to understand that we must eat, but we\ncan't eat just anything. We have to take care of our bodies and no matter what\nwe have to die at some point. I believe it is humanly possible to reject these\nnotions and at current pace, I believe, within a 30-50 year period it will begin\nto seem silly that we once assumed that:\n\n1. We need our bodies, and our internal organs to live. Our consciousness lives\nwithin our mind. The rest of our bodies primary function is to keep our brain\nalive and reproduce. At present our organs and internal functions are\nliabilities, and we've grown accustomed to this. Ideally we will be able to\nreplace our organs with artificial devices almost at will if necessary. \n\nIt is unclear if cancer is something that can truly be cured but if we could\nreplace our organs at will with artificial organs (that cannot develop cancer) we\nwould be a lot closer than we are now. All cancer cells are not the same, so it\nseems unlikely that we will ever develop a panacea cure for cancer it self. What\nis more likely is that we will develop better early detection methods and\ndevelop ways to replace our vital organs so that cancer cannot develop and/or\nspread. \n\nresearch in this field is promising. Large numbers of people have already\nreceived artificial hearts but the majority of aritifical organs are only useful\nfor keeping people alive until they can receive a transplant or they require\nfrequent invasive maintenance that limits ones quality of life. However,\ntechnology does seem to be moving in a direction where we could conceivably have\nsustainable artificial insides that work better than those we are born with.\n\nIdeally to maintain these artificial organs we would be able to swallow the doctor,\nthat is take a capsule containing nano-robots that will monitor and reapair our \naritificial organs.\n\nArtificial Lungs:\n    1.\n    http://www.webmd.com/lung/features/artificial-lung-closer-to-clinical-trial\n    2.\n    https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537911/new-device-could-be-a-safer-alternative-to-lung-ventilators/\n    3. http://engineering.case.edu/artificial_lung\n\nArtificial Livers:\n    1. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150717142455.htm\n    2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22482522\n\n2. That we must eat to survive. First, remember my complaints about our internal\norgans? A lot of the damage we do to those is because of what we eat. It is\nmaddening to think that we must maintain this perfectly balanced diet in order to\nensure health and even then, almost everything we eat seems to have some\ndangerous side effect. It's 2016, we should be eating for pleasure, not for\nsurvival. Also food inequality is more extreme than ever globally, albeit stable in the US.\nIt is a tragedy that\nwe accept the current state as it is, where one section of the world can eat\nwhatever they want to gluttonous excess and the other survives on scraps. Its\nmaddening that high speed internet is beginning to encompass the world yet clean\ndrinking water and nutrition are only accessible to a portion of us.\n\nSecond, lets think of the economics and environmental impact of the agricultural\nindustry. Almost every square mile of land on this planet has been affected in\nsome way by agriculture. In most countries, it is nearly impossible for someone\nto easily find and reach untouched earth. Vertical farming and precision agricultural are\npromising but we don't have the ability to feed everyone easily, unless we\ntransition the worlds population to a 100% plant based diet. This holds true,\ngiven that most animal based food consumes 9 times as many calories than we\nare able to harvest from them and cattle have a significant impact on humanities\ncarbon footprint. Even if we transition to algae or insect based protein, and other plant\nbased food, the agricultural industry is still one of the leading causes of\nenergy/water waste, and environmental pollution. Not to mention food borne\nillness and malnutrition are still killing hundreds of thousands of people as we\nspeak. \n\nCompanies like Soylent, Impossible Foods, and others are doing a great job of getting us further a long but\neven then it takes significantly more energy from the sun in order to produce\nthis food than we will ever get out of it. If we think of the human body as\nsomething that exists just to power the brain and reproduce, then conceivably we\ncould power the brain and other forms of human function solely with electricity. Whether we generate electricity\nthrough biological (photosynthesis) or hardware based methods remains to be seen. But if\nwe could power a cybernetic humanoid body with electricity we would also\neliminate our dependance on our internal organs to survive. If we could reach\nthis point we would become more efficient at harvesting energy from the sun, by\ncutting out the middle man (food).\n\nSolar Power is known to be a solvable engineering problem. As for photosynthetic\nmethods in humans it is unclear if this will ever be possible. Though research\nhas been conducted by Christina Agapakis:\n\n1. http://agapakis.com/thesis.pdf\n\nAnother option, although completely unresearched, would be to have a bioreactor\nbuilt into a future android body that utilizes a symbiotic relationship with\nalgae blooms living inside of this android body to directly generate energy from\nphotosynthetic means. For something tangentially related:\nhttp://blog.mbl.edu/?p=3285\n\nRecently, A man has agreed to undergo a full head transplant. It does seem\nlikely that we could either replace much of our body with cybernetic components\nwith time or transplant our brains entirely into an android body. Also notable,\nRobert White successfully connected the brain of a monkey to the central nervous\nsystem of another monkey in 1963. \n\n3. That we must die. If we can replace our body with cybernetics and no longer\nneed to eat to survive then most if not all modern diseases are now irrelevant.\nThe only thing limiting our lifespan is how long we can maintain our brain\nbefore it begins to malfunction. There are already electrical brain implants\nthat can handle some of this but we will really need to improve the quality and\nscope of these if we are to maintain our consciousness for ever. If we can\nsuccessfully figure out a way to augment our brains then we could live for\nhundreds of years. \n\nBy extending our lifespan and removing the need for food/water, suddenly things like colonizing the galaxy, or at\nleast our solar system are much easier. Additionally the number of atmospheres\nwe can survive in skyrockets. Colonization would obviously be the next step,\ngiven that population will likely grow drastically on earth. There is still an\nupper bound for how many humans the earth could support, although without a\nneed for food or water this planet could certianly support significantly more.\nEventually space and hardware waste/recycling begins to be the limiting factor. \n\nOf course if we have eliminated the traditional concept of the human body and\neating to survive our culture will change drastically and if we augment our brain\nextensively one could argue that we may no longer be human. Going forward human\nevolution may be driven by technological increases and not by artificial\nselection.\n\n4. The idea that we must work to live. for centuries now, we have taken pride in\nour work. And we should continue to do so. But we should work out of passion,\nout of ambition, not out of a need to survive. In all likelihood there is a\ncoming wave of Artificial Intelligence and robotics that will automate most\nmenial tasks and labor. This leads us to a fork in the road where we can move to\na dystopian society with extreme unemployment rates, which is of course\nunsustainable because people will need money in order to feed the corporations\nseeking to profiteer from automation. Or we can move into a Utopian society where the\nwealth gains from AI and automation are distributed uniformly as a form of basic\nincome, freeing the lower and middle classes from wage servitude and allowing\npeople to freely work on the things that interest them most. This should, in\ntheory help society maximize its time spent on innovation and creative arts.\n\nIf we could acheive this we could drastically reduce the need for fossil fuels\nand clean water. Our energy consumption would now be harvested directly from the\nSun. We could finally escape the apocalyptic future of runaway climate change,\nand we could affectively eliminate the current unsustainable consumptive model required\nfor human survival. Space will of course become an issue, however population\ngrowth should slow tremendously given a significant decrease in labor demand.\nFor some cycle of generations humanity would still be able to support population\ngrowth through reproduction given that our consumptive model should be orders of\nmagnitude more efficient without a need for fossil fuels or food to survive.\nThis should allow us to become much more efficient with how we allocate space.\nAutonomous transportation will also eliminate the need for massive parking lots\nand free up more urban space as well. Additionally, if we are fully cybernetic\nour requirements for comfort and accomodation would be greatly reduced. For a\ntranshuman aritificial body, sleeping outside offers virtually the same level of\ncomfort as a 10,000 sq. ft. mansion. Though I doubt people will ever, or should\never reject the comforts of having our own private space. The value proposition\nof purchasing space at the highest possible premiums begins to disappear.\n\nThe major problem facing humanity at this point will be allocation of hardware\nwaste from artifical organs and parts replacements. One obvious option would be\nto eject it into space. The secondary problem facing humanity will likely be\nboredom. How we as a collective species decide to allocate our newfound time and\nabilities will be the deciding factor on whether transhumanism is the savior of\nhumanity or an existential threat. \n\nDuring a transition period from bilogical to electronic hardware, another threat\nto society will be classism and inequality. If genetic and cybernetic\nmodifications are only made available to the wealthy then two problems arise.\nFirst, There is a loss of egalitarianism, we cannot transition away from work or\naway from food and truly maximize human potential here on earth if only a\nfraction of the earths population can transition. Second, living in a world\nwhere we have split the population into altered and unaltered humans, with one\ngroup having a clear unfair advantage would create a new caste system unlike any\nthe world has ever seen. This partition of society could effectively undermine\ndemocratic function entirely. Given this, the clear path forward seems to be a\ncentrally regulated process for transition. Likely we would prioritize people\nbased on current health risks, and current access to food/water. This\nmethodology will allow for \"emergency\" transitions for those in dire need to\nserve as research so that the process can be honed. Robotic surgical equipment\ncan be developed to complete these operations and at first regulation can impose\na prohibitively high cost that in some sense penalizes early adopters (the\nwealthy). The large profit margins can be used to further fund R&amp;D and fund the\ntransitions of those less fortunate. Governments would have to regulate this and\nsee that all have equal opportunity to transition. Why would a government want\nto sponsor something like this? First government tax burdens are greatly\nalleviated in a post human society. The government will no longer need to impose\nwage floors, that may eventually carry down to consumers. Social programs for\nfood assistance will no longer be neccesary and our healthcare problems will be\neasily eliminated as the new form of healthcare will be hardware maintenance. We\nwill likely develop insurance plans and maintenance schedules for our bodies\nsimilar to what we have with modern automobiles. The government will be free of\nmedicare, medicaid, and social security provisioning. Pharmaceuticals will no\nlonger be neccesary because hardware and brain chemistry can be altered at will\nthrough software updates and modifications. Paying for transhumanism begins to\nlook like a small investment to governments. Especially given that this method\nof transition can ensure egalitarianism alongside wealth gains for all. \n\nAll of this likely seems extremely far off. I suspect that human level machine\nintelligence is very far off, but turing complete humanoid artifical\nintelligence is right around the corner. Most technology for hardware related\nadvances arleady exists. The true question is whether or not we can make our\nbrains interface purely with electical equipment. Research is already under way\non this, and plenty of electronic augmentations and implants for the brain\nalready exists. Regardless of when the day comes, this will likely be an\nexistential crossroads for humanity and policy frameworks should be discussed\nnow rather than later in order to avoid a world where technology access allows\nfor runaway equality and an eventual collapse of society.\n",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\none of the universal objectives of the tranhumanist movement, is to encourage the development of medical technology that can eradicate disease and disabilities. \n\n**Who hasn't been touched by a health crisis? Either personally, or in regards to loved ones?**\n\nUniversally transhumanists want private and public institutions to make healthcare a priority. Unfortunately, we as a society do not.\n\nHow can we as activists help this along?\n\nHow can we capture the non-transhumanist public's imagination, in order to improve healthcare via technology?\n\n*Elon Musk captured the world's attention (of course not only for this reason), by* *presenting a master plan to radically change transportation and energy* *infrastructure.*\n\n*His goal is to make electric, semi automated and automated cars standard. And to* *make solar panels/roofs, and home energy storage standard, so that homes have a* *(practically) self sufficient energy generating infrastructure. I think that is a* *brilliant, and practical vision, and I wish Elon Musk and any copying* *entrepreneurs/companies luck.*\n\nI think we need an Musk masterpan (#muskmasterplan) for healthcare, to capture hearts and inspire. \n\nI think it would be more effective it isn't based in idealism, but is based on amalgamating **current and developing** medical technology.\n\nExamples of medical technology that could radically change healthcare...\n\n*In 2016, IBM Watson saved a woman's life by identifying that she had a rare form of Leukemia. In 10 minutes. After Doctors were baffled by her condition for months.*\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ibms-watson-ai-saves-womans-life-after-diagnosing-rare-form-of-leukaemia_uk_57a849ade4b04ca9b5d381ef\n\n*Also in 2016, a computer program identified lung cancer more accurately, in comparison to Doctors.*\n\nhttp://www.extremetech.com/extreme/233746-ai-beats-doctors-at-visual-diagnosis-observes-many-times-more-lung-cancer-signals\n  \nI want a 2nd opinion from medical computer programs to become standard, ASAP. I'm sure you guys do too.\n\nI tweeted Zoltan Istvan to consider creating a #muskmasterplan, regarding healthcare. And I advised him to consult this link to do so...\n\nhttp://medicalfuturist.com/\n\nAnd I'm asking my fellow transhumanists, to either:\n\n**A) Tweet Elon Musk, and ask him to create a healthcare masterplan that** **companies and/or governments can implement to help humanity.**\n\n**Because if Elon creates a plan, governments and companies will take it seriously. It** **will also be practical, though ambitious.**\n\n**B) Create your own #muskmasterplan (I think the hastag will help give it** **publicity) for healthcare and share it online. So that it publicizes how better our** **health could be, if we gave priority to medical science and technology.**\n\nWill you take my challenge?",

        "text": "So first off, I suffer from OCD and very neurotic pessimistic thinking. I have thought about many things in transhumanism and I can't help but wonder if transhuman thought is a mistake. I know the whole thing about transhumanism is being more than human, but I don't think I would want to be anything else other than human.\n\n So many transhuman concepts freak me out, like immortality. I don't like the idea of dying, but the idea of being biologically immortal just freak me out. I can't comprehend the thought of being immortal. It just freaks me out for some reason to be living for so long. I wonder how living that long would affect me. And what if I against all odds somehow live long enough to gain god-like intellect? That I learned and mastered everything in life and understand everything about the universe. Then what? What would be the point of my existence? Would I still even be me? Or some emotionless uncaring super intelligent being that is so far removed from humanity  (like Dr.Manhattan from the Watchman series if anybody if familiar with it)\n\nOr being merged or becoming a computer, or downloading my mind into a computer. That shit really scares the shit out of me. What even would I be at that point? Am I still even me?\n\nI could go on and on about different reasons why transhumanism scares me but basically the future terrifies me. I suffer from existential depression so I don't know if that has anything to do with my views but the way I see it, I am fine with being human. I am fine with dying someday (i'm down with life extension stuff to put on some more years but immortality no) I am fine with my human limitations.\n\nI know that tech is going to advance regardless of my opinion and people should have a choice in the end but I just don't see anything good that can come out of transhuamanism thoughts. So can somebody give me a idea on why I shouldn't fear it?",
