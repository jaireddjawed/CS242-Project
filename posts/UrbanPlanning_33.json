        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am currently in the process of separating from the military after 4 years of service and am considering pursuing a degree in either Urban Design or Urban Planning from Florida Atlantic University. I just wanted to hear from the experts as to which degree I should pursue and if anyone can elaborate on the differences of the two. \n\nFrom what I've researched, Urban Design is similar to architecture, but you would be designing cities. It is also on a smaller scale than Urban Planning. Also, Urban Planning is more about policies and laws.\n\nI have a long-term goal of ultimately earning a M.U.R.P., as there is no M.U.D. program near me. I am also considering attempting to get into UF's Sustainability and The Built Environment BS program, as it seems to be pretty similar.\n\nAlso, how difficult is it to find a job in these career fields? I am unsure if I have ever seen an Urban Design job available on indeed.com. I have seen some Urban Planning jobs. I am thinking that a lot of these jobs contain skills that would be pulled from either degree and are interchangeable.\n\nThanks",

For example, American cities were largely built around freeways, whereas European cities were built hundreds of years ago around the central plaza. Thus, European cities tend to be more conducive to a happier, more cohesive lifestyle.\n\nI've seen Urbanized \\([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jpN8kI0\\-pY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jpN8kI0-pY)\\) and thought it was fantastic.

        "title": "A Nashville compromise commuter plan that voters will approve?",
        "author": "midflinx",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/8ibhec/a_nashville_compromise_commuter_plan_that_voters/",
        "text": "Many suburban Nashville voters didn't think they'd benefit enough from the rejected plan. Light rail wouldn't extend close to where they live. Even plan proponents acknowledge it wouldn't have reduced traffic for them, at least initially. What about a compromise plan that helps how they commute, while still creating a support structure for a transit network closer to the city center? The less expensive BRT part would still be included in modified form. \n\nA big caveat is this new plan assumes by the time voters approve it and infrastructure is complete by the mid-2020s, autonomous buses with an exclusive right of way all to themselves will safely and reliably travel at freeway speeds. For the following to make any sense, the autonomous part has to be accepted as likely feasible. The [actual website](https://www.intelligenttransitnashville.com/the-intelligent-transit-plan) for the plan is overoptimistic in its timeline, but I believe the concept makes sense even if it takes a few years longer.\n\nThis alternative, officially called Intelligent Transit, was presented in early April with suspicious timing. It wasn't fully fleshed out. It's missing details. However it could still have merits worth considering and discussing as a thought experiment. It has several major parts, including a futuristic implementation of BRT lacking details like the space needed for boarding islands, but that's likely solvable with study identifying suitable locations.\n\nA cornerstone of Intelligent Transit moves the Music City Central main bus terminal from near the State Capitol building to one mile southeast at the present site of PCS Metals. This is still no further than 1.5 miles from any part of downtown. A simulation shows it allows for overall better bus circulation. The location next to the freeway is crucial for the next major part. \n\nThat part being new autonomous bus-only lanes built from the inside median of six freeways. That creates the needed ROW. Some stretches of median have grass and space to spare. Other parts will need widening. The six spokes extend 25, 30, even 40 miles out, reaching and directly benefiting ten counties total. On the spokes are sixteen Transit Centers. By comparison, the plan that lost had light rail extending up to 8 miles out, and Rapid buses about 10. IT gives much more distant voters a real alternative to driving. Bringing other counties and more people into this means the proposed tax increases could be distributed and smaller too.   \n\nOn the ROW will run autonomous buses of unspecified length, but they appear comparable to articulated buses. They bring commuters to the same Music City Central terminal, now conveniently adjacent the freeway. No mention of platform length, but they could be built two buses long, or with space allowing for future doubling. Peak service frequency is described as only every fifteen minutes, but I don't see why multiples more buses couldn't be added as ridership increases.\n\nAs the buses near or reach the downtown freeway loop there's another major change. The loop is three lanes wide. 35% of vehicles on it are just passing through, entering from one side of the city and leaving on another. If those 35% are diverted, an entire lane can and will be given to the autonomous buses. From this lane buses have convenient access to the relocated Music City Central main terminal.  \n\nDepending on available space, the 35% of diverted vehicles go either onto a widened freeway lane with physical separation from other lanes, or up onto an elevated lane. Because it's for through-traffic, there will be no on and off ramps except at the outer four points connecting to the rest of the freeways. The IT website estimates 11.6 miles of this. It also estimates much lower costs per mile, but this recently built [flyover ramp](https://www.reviewjournal.com/traffic/new-flyover-ramp-at-the-centennial-bowl-interchange-opens-july-12/) in Las Vegas cost $47 million for half a mile. I hope redditors have other relevant data points about freeway expansion and flyover ramp costs? Rounding up to 15 miles and $100 million per mile, even $1.5 billion could sound favorable to voters. That's not the total plan cost, but it is the most expensive part.    \n\nAs a compromise this idea still has street-level BRT and provides ways both near and distant commuters can avoid congestion and leave their cars at home or outside of the city center. In prioritizing commuters, reaching much further out from the city, and distributing costs with low per person taxes, perhaps a greater percentage of voters would be willing to vote for this?",
