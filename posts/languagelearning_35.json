But I just keep thinking, what's the point of learning a language?\n\nLike, I'll see all these posts about how \"Oh I think in English more than I do in my native language\" and \"I'm forgetting \\[insert language\\] and I think in English better.\" Yeah, English is an important language and more and more people are learning it.\n\nSo what's the point of learning a language if everyone is learning English?\n\nI mean, I *know* the answer. I love language learning. I love the process. I love the cultures/movies/music/food/people/etc. that it opens you up to. I love the linguistics behind it too.\n\nI'm not saying that learning English is easy, but jeez am I jealous that non-native English speakers have so many resources for learning it. They can just use the internet daily and basically immerse themselves in it, because English is used (and incredibly necessary) all the time!\n\nPlus technology does everything better. Deepl can write an essay better than I can in Spanish. I just feel I'm learning all this for nothing, which isn't true, but I can't help think it.\n\nIdk. This is a bad rant.",

And so what I’ve noticed is that when trying to make sentences in Japanese, just absently, with the small selection of words I know, I find myself saying in my head or out loud things like “Wir sind nach かんこく Flügen” Which, without the kanji because I haven’t learned any yet, ends up being in half-German half-Japanese, “We’re flying to Korea”.\n\nSo, long winded explanation, but, does anyone else catch themselves doing this? Building sentences unintentionally using the language you’re actively learning, and one you already know, but not natively? Because I never do it with English lol",

But I am also interested in Thai language and culture and want to start another language soon. My plan would be to take Mandarin all four years but learn Thai intensely (or as intensely as I can) in my free time. Then when I am at a decent level, I will get my Mandarin up to par, maybe through books in Thai if possible.\n\nBut the reason I am asking is because I know Mandarin is already a challenging language for a native English speaker and adding another Asian language on top may confuse me. I do believe that since language classes offered through schools in America aren’t that intensive, I should be fine. I also picked up on the grammatical nuances of Spanish fairly quickly. But I would like to here any advice or opinions from others.",

The first word that comes to mind when I have to translate \"centipede\" is always *alipunga* (athlete's foot), then I know it's wrong so I'll think of *alimasag* (crab)*,* then *alimango* (another kind of crab), then *alikabok* (dust), and many other similar words. Then I still would not remember. I will give up after a few minutes. I don't want to search it out because I want myself to remember it. Then after a few hours, or sometimes a few weeks and months, I would suddenly remember it. *Alupihan.* I would even repeat it to myself. Then give me some time, like a few days or weeks, and poof! I will forget it again. I'm gonna go back to repeating *alipunga* and the chain of similar words until I remember *alupihan.* I keep forgetting that *alupihan* starts with alu- and not ali- no matter how many times I've thought of remembering that already.

        "text": "I always see comments that comprehending is so much easier than producing, but I was wondering if anyone else felt like the opposite? Am I crazy, lol. Like I feel like I can navigate most of my secondary, tertiary, etc language and communicate what I want to with no issues. While I could understand most of what someone else was saying if they used a glob of words I didn't know, I wouldn't be in that preferred zone of understanding completely.\n\nSo when people say they can generally understand what someone is saying, it means that they don't exactly know but can usually guess based on context? Or they genuinely and completely understand what someone is saying but just can't respond? If it's the first, that makes sense but if it's the second then that just blows my mind. I don't understand how you can fully understand someone but not be able to generate a response back. \n\nAm I the only one who feels like this lol.",

As an ESL teacher, I think some teachers are kinda just lazy, they just speak and then write down words you don't know on a Google docs but they have no method of teaching actually, and have done no preparation for the class. The class is more like a tutoring session rather than the teacher preparing material just for me.\n\nI have a lot of materials for what I'm learning now, Thaipod101 lifetime, FSI Thai, Living Languages, and Pimsleur. But honestly I feel like most of what I use can be self-studied, I just need a teacher for practice but now I feel like I am wasting money now, because most of my lesson the structure needed to be productive.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?",

I usually get home a little before 5PM, but am not free until after I walk my dog and such, and by then it’s around 5:30PM. I have homework, trying to go to (more like hoping to) sleep around 10:30PM. I usually eat dinner between 7:00-8:00PM and do homework before then. Any suggestions for how to squeeze in studying Spanish? I am self-studying, but that’s besides the point. I’m just struggling to get it done trying to balance everything while still being lively and well-rested. I’m pretty exhausted, physically and mentally, by the time I have free time in the later evening before bed though, but maybe that’s just an excuse. I’m just stumped right now with what to do. Learning Spanish is very important to me so I really want to be able to study it consistently in my life right now. This seems to be a very dedicated hobby. How do you manage to study? How do you organize your time for studying if you’re also a student or have a job? Thank you everyone for your input, I appreciate it very much.",

It's like it hits this uncanny valley in my cognition where I actually expend MORE effort trying to understand instead of less, yet also find it more difficult to remember words that were said and what I think they mean. I find it very unrewarding when I do pick up new words because of the mental strain invovlved.\n\nWhereas in beginner, it seems like my brain gives up trying to understand and just lets the meaning come to it. The problem is the meaning is highly fragmented and limited by what I can remember, what I can interpret from sensory input, and by what my novice ears can hear. I can pick up a few new words in each video and have somewhat of an idea on what they might mean, and it feels very satisfying to do so, even if my guesses are incorrect.\n\nI don't know, what do you think is the best option? Something in between? Mixing the two?",

For this game that the boys play he is going by the name Mantequilla. It took me half way or more though the episode to realize the joke here that his name is just butter in Spanish. \n\nI didn't need the subtitles at all when the Mexican characters spoke to Butters in Spanish and the word mantequilla is one I would instantly know what it meant when heard in a Spanish sentence. Yet for some reason I heard the word 5-10 times used like it was a normal word in English and I didn't pick up on it until it randomly occurred to me and I was like \"Oh duh\". \n\nThis happened when watching Better Call Saul with the company Mesa Verde, but I was a very low level in Spanish back then and now I'm more or less at a lower intermediate level.
