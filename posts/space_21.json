My question stems from an episode of ‚ÄúDoctor Who‚Äù I am watching where they mention there are three suns in the sky. That, along with Tatooine from ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù having multiple suns, has me questioning it.\n\nObviously multiple moons makes sense as we have examples of that in our solar system. And to go back to my earlier point, perhaps a planet orbits one sun but there are multiple visible in the sky? I suppose we can see multiple suns in the forms of stars. Is this all just sci-fi ‚Äúdon‚Äôt read too much into it‚Äù stuff? Or, is it possible for a planet to have multiple suns ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù (or whatever criteria it would require) to differentiate them as ‚Äúsuns‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äústars‚Äù?",

        "text": "I have been trying to figure out this pointless bit of trivia for awhile now but can't seem to find a definite answer.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nApollo 13 is the furthest man has ever been from the Earth.  400,171 kilometers when they went around the moon.  Now my question is, which of the three was sitting in the outside seat at that time?  At the exact moment the farthest distance was reached, who was just a little bit further than the others?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nIt's not an important metric at all, but technically one of the three went further than the other two.  I'm just curious as to who that would be.  I can't seem to find any detailed info on seating arrangements or that exact moment.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nCan anyone help me with this pointless quest?",
