        "text": "So I just had a kind of random thought, like how there's the cyberpunk genre that heavily features people modifying themselves beyond recognition. To a lesser extent, that's part of Sci Fi in general, like the Borg in Star Trek. A general sense of detachment from nature, for lack of a better term.\n\nAnd then of course, there's movies, shows, games, etc. that instead depict harmony with nature, embracing it. Most Studio Ghibli movies such as Nausicaa or My Neighbor Totoro are such examples.\n\nI got to thinking, what's the opposite of this? I was thinking maybe \"spiritual technology\" like what the Chozo from Metroid have. Samus for example doesn't really become a machine, but rather the machine (her power suit) becomes her, through willpower. It's technically not even separate from her body when she's using the suit.\n\nOr additionally, I suppose the opposite is just a respect for the natural order/circle of life, kind of like what the Jedi from Star Wars have. What do you think?",

        "text": "Before we start, keep in mind I am a 23 y/o male, living with my family, and still in college.\n\nI had a very major surgery about a week and 1/2 ago now. I knew about the surgery for about a month prior and of course dreaded it. The doctor told me there were many complications that could occur during the procedure that were very real, serious, could result in death. As a result, I spent the entire month before more or less coming to terms with my death, like legitimately. I cleaned my room spotless, kicked all my dirty or unsavory habits, talked with a priest and was given a lot blessing usually only performed on the very sick and dying, and made arrangements for my possessions dispersion. I even gave my financial credentials to my parents, full 9 yards. Like the doctor was going to personally shoot me in the head during the procedure lol. \n\nI looked at and experienced everything like it was my last time doing so. I also had to drop all my classes this semester, this time not due my potential death, but were I to live, recovery is about 3-4 months so school was not an option.\n\nAnyway you get the picture, and are probably thinking I was exaggerating, which in hindsight could be said, but it was legitimately a very risky procedure, to the degree that even my parents, both veterans of major surgeries, weren't really against this actions either. \n\nObviously I made it through fine. It was a weird experience spending a week straight in a hospital, but by the end I was use to it and kind of enjoying it, but for some reason I was dreading coming back home, I could tell why though. Eventually I was discharge and came home though. It was... weird. Everything was the same, just as I'd left it. It was just like any other time I came home, but for some reason it just felt odd. I chalked it up to being use to the hospital and figured I'd be over it by the next morning, but I wasn't.\n\nIt's been 4 days now, and I still almost feel like a guest here, I don't feel comfortable, and I've been depressed the entire time. I don't know why. Hospitals suck, they're scary, I could not get a single night of good sleep, I was constantly in pain, and all the rooms next to me were filled with screaming people, but I felt so much happier and at peace than I do here and I absolutely cannot tell why. It's not even a \"I liked being away from my family\" thing, my mom visited every single day and spend upwards of 15hrs there with me every time. \n\nI'm sitting in my room now and it all just feels... I don't know. I don't like music anymore eventhough I loved it before. I don't want to play any of my games, I don't want to draw, I don't want to eat, I don't want to do anything I use to love. I'm depressed and I don't know why. I use to think \"if I make it through the surgery I'll be so happy\", but I'm not. \n\nThose of you who've had major surgeries, did you experience this after as well? How long did it last?",

On the other hand, the guy's family is massive.\n\nI had an idea for my dance performance and wanted to make it interactive with the guests. For that, I needed the brothers of both the girl and the guy to help me plan it out if they were comfortable with it. \n\nWith all my excitement, I ended up contacting the guy's side brother, who I've never met or seen before, and ended up telling him my idea over a video call. I did this because the guy's side were thinking of performing on the same song as myself which I had already started choreographing (half way through it now). I didn't want the boy's side to abandon this song they wanted to do and proposed that maybe we could all perform together with my plan.\n\nThe conversation went well but I just feel a little awkward and scared if I've come off too strong onto the brother of the groom who I've never even met before. Like, we've never met, I straight up went for a video call, we've had no formal introduction through the to-be bride and groom.\n\nAm I going crazy here? Am I overthinking something which is an okay social interaction? Did I come off too strong. Please help me ease these thoughts",

It is not a country without a military.  It's right on the United States border.  The US freaked out over Cuba, we should not start a war with Mexico.  \n\nThe Last time we did this Thoreau wrote \"Civil Disobedience,\" Lincoln denounced it as a war of pure evil.  Yes, that Lincoln.  There was the largest rate of mutiny ever recorded within the US Military.  \n\nThere are also a lot of Mexicans in the United States, living where you live.  What do you think they're going to do if you bomb their country?  Not a lot of people in the United States care very much about countries in Europe, Africa, or Asia; but a hell of a lot of people have high affection for Mexico.  \n\nThis war is not about the Cartel.  The Mexican Federals just had a huge war  against the Cartels after capturing Chappo's son.  They're not secretly working with the Cartels.  This war is about Mexico, under it's current government operating as it's own agent.  \n\nThey nationalized their lithium and other mineral resources.  They're being defiant towards US Capital.  They're breaking embargos and not going along with US wars.  They're protecting other Latin American nations against US intervention.  This is about re-conquering the South.  \n\nThis is an evil war.  It must not happen, and if it does, it will destroy the United States as a hegemone.   It will lead to worse riots than you have ever seen.  It will lead to mutiny.  It will lead to the greatest economic disaster in our history.  It will lead to nothing good.  Do not do it.",

I mostly did vegetation maintenance: trimming trees, pruning brush, mowing grass. I also took out the trash every week and occasionally helped out with trail maintenance. It was fun getting to ride through the park in the gator or truck to get between jobs, or drive the riding mower. I liked that I could listen to music or podcasts while I did monotonous tasks. I liked watching people around me have fun on their bikes, and it made me happy that I was helping to make the park a nicer place to be. It was also very satisfying being able to see the results of my work and feel productive at the end of every day. \n\nI will be graduating college in two months with a degree in mechanical engineering. Although I have done very well in school, I honestly have no idea what to expect when going into the workforce. What if I’m not happy working a desk job? What if the work isn’t fulfilling? Even though I’m good at school, what if I’m not good at the professional side of things? It’s just so different from the jobs I’ve enjoyed the most in the past that I’m worried I won’t be happy doing something else. I’m also feeling extremely burnt out from school right now, so that’s definitely not helping things. \n\nI’m looking forward to being done with school and I’m overall excited for what the future holds, but I’m also kinda scared. So, what do you do for a living? Do you like it? How did you get there?",

        "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years now. We’ve been having a tough time financially this last year. Recently she has been getting these bad migraines and has been unable to sleep due to “random thoughts, like random songs that won’t get out of (her) head”. Last night, she was awake, as per usual, as 3:30 am. This time, she was sobbing and telling me she cant handle the stress anymore and wants to leave and doesnt think she deserves to be with me because im too nice and i deserve better. I told her i was not too good for anyone and i was very happy with her but that if I couldn’t make her happy, then i would understand if she really wanted to leave. But i put it in to perspective and asked if she would feel the same if we had enough money, to which she replied no. So i told her to relax a little and not to stress about it. \n\nAnyways, we stayed up a few hours and eventually i got her to go to sleep at around 5:30 am. I woke up for an interview at 9:30 am and she stayed in bed until around 12:30 pm. Im happy she rested, i was very tired though. We spent some time together and I asked her if she was feeling better which she replied “yes, but its still hard for me to sleep, which is why i had a breakdown.” \n\nHer and I had been smoking weed every day for about 2.5 years now and i stopped last month because i want to join the air force and i refuse to fail that drug test. She stopped as well out of respect. Today, i offered to get her some to see if that would help her sleep and although she said she would feel guilty smoking around me since im not smoking, i assured her I wouldn’t be tempted or bothered as long as it helped her. \n\nShe smoked very little of a joint, and we were watching an animal documentary until around 9:30 pm. I got up to play rocket league with my little brother and when i turned around to check on her around 11:30 pm, she was on the couch sleeping. The couch is more comfortable than our bed so im not going to bother and bring her to the room. \n\nIt just filled me up with joy that she is finally able to sleep without all the stress and anxiety. I understand her, i want her to feel better and i honestly had a lot of faith the weed would help her out. \n\nIm glad she is sleeping and feeling better. I can sleep peacefully now knowing she is okay and not feel guilty about sleeping while she struggles to shut off her mind. \n\nI love her a lot. As soon as I know when i will be going to Basic Training, my buddy is going to marry us. I’m ready to spend the rest of my life with this girl. Even though she thinks im too good for her, she has no idea how much she makes my days better. She’s the best thing to ever happen to me, as cliche as it sounds. \n\nA, i hope you sleep well. I love you.",

I think of insurance companies that place dollar values on human lives all the time and it is considered normal practice. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

One day my girl friends were going to watch our classmates play football/soccer (ps. I'm from Eastern Europe, so imagine everything poorly, not american movie style lmao).\n\nI never went there but decided to make an exception cause I liked a boy and it was a good excuse to see him\n\nBefore the match boys were changing their shirts for some reason, like outside near the stadium, and us girls were just chatting on the opposite side of it \n\nAnd just when I centred my gaze on my crush about to take his shirt off my friend stepped right in front of me and started talking\nCompletely blocked the view\n\nI remember getting mad, irritated and then very embarrassed cause I realised what I was doing LMAO\n\nWe we all like 13-14 years old, literal children\nI love that memory it's so funny",

Personally I would probably use Reddit a little less, I think it might still be entertaining. I don't think people will try to give advice as much and waste their time educating an AI about a fake problem, but I think just asking questions might still be interesting. Does it really matter to you in the end if the people here are real or not? Does it matter if I'm real to you?",
