Me taking pure extra olive oil and putting a cross in oil on both sides of every door in the house while saying a prayer. At that time, the demon frightened my kitten, threw a frozen package of hamburgers across the kitchen, a disembodied voice hollered in my ear after I refused to respond to the burger incident, something blew icy cold breath directly into my neck when I was standing against my bed while my roommate searched for a wolf spider under my table. Also while sleeping, I sleep with a light on, 2 early mornings in a row I woke up and it messed with my eyes. The first time my eyes were covered with a vision of a headless person in red shirt and blue pants. I blinked for 10 minutes before it went away. It took up my entire vision. The next morning early I woke up and my eyes were covered in a vision completely in black. I freaked out! Started repeatedly blinking and praying to God to make it go away. Also telling the demon I’m covered in the blood of Jesus and you can’t hurt me and to be gone! Finally it left. \n\nNow I’m being bothered by a familiar spirit again while sleeping or an incubus.  Lifting my arms and hands up and dropping them. This happened a few nights ago. And the other morning while sleeping I was having vivid dreams and the last one was me in my bed and a deeply black shadow figure standing over my bed on the side and bending down near me. By instinct I started punching the air violently thinking it was my roommate and realizing what it was and woke up and nothing there. What’s going on??",

But there was a time when I was frightened by just the idea of sleeping.\n\n It all began about 6 years ago. I went home late at night very tired to the point that I immediately fell asleep upon falling down my bed without even changing. But upon waking up, I felt so uneasy and the atmosphere of my room was dreadful. I got up but then I saw myself still sleeping on the bed. I looked around and there were pictures and paintings hanging on my wall which I didn’t have in my room.I took a closer look at the images and they were evil. I can’t really make anything out of the other pictures because they were a bit distorted, but I felt that it meant evil. I tried going out of my room but I couldn’t.\n\nMy doors and windows weren’t there. I tried to scream for help but I had no voice, and the more I tried the harder it was to breathe. That was when I realised that it was a dream. But I still can’t wake up from it. The images in the paintings got darker and more frightening the longer I stayed in the dream.  I tried so hard to open my eyes and move my hands but I just couldn’t. I don’t know how I managed to finally wake up.\n\n\n I only found out a few months later that I experienced what was called sleep paralysis when I came across a video about the same as what I've experienced.  And from then it only got worse.",

But her Sisters and brothers (10 of them) want a priest to come at her wake and did so in the back of my mother and her brothers and Sister. We were pissed they did it. Well we were not alone to be piss. About 30 seconds after the priest start to talk lights turn off. The whole building is in a black-out. We laugh at the situation and I chose to left the building with my siblings and go to my appartement at a 2 minute walk from the funeral home. All building had electricity except the funeral home. It appenratly came back just a bit after the priest left. Good job grandma.",

His favorite morning words are mom, Bob, and hello. Multiple times in the last week I've heard his meow in another part of the house, but when I look over, he's sleeping in his laundry basket and there's no way he would have made the sound. About an hour ago I heard him in the hallway, first he yelled moooom like he normally does, and then I heard him yell boooooooooooob fairly long and the way he said it, it got higher at the end and I thought to myself 'wow that was really cute, hes never said it like that before.' Then I looked to my right and he was standing very still next to my bed with his ears perked all the way up and his head tilted towards the stairwell. There is no way he would have been able to get next to me in the time that I heard the sound, from the few seconds it took me to turn my head. He obviously heard the sound too. He didn't seem scared, but he definitely seemed to be aware that something else just made his voice and after about a minute of listening went to investigate. He stood at the bottom of the stairs, staring up for awhile and then started yelling his favorite words very loudly and seemed pretty irritated while he was doing it.  I've had other odd experiences in this house, but i haven't felt uneasy like this. I've heard of weird things like mimics imitating the sound of a person's voice, but never of a cat. Whatever it was, nearly succeeded in getting me to come to it by using my elderly cat as the bait.",

He’s only called me once before after an incident and he was a little freaked out. This one was definitely different and I wanted to share and see if anyone else has ever experienced something like this. \n\nHe’s had many sleep paralysis episodes. They have always been the same. Dark shadow figure with red eyes looming over him and he can’t speak or move. He describes it as a dementor waiting to suck out your soul.  Never a fun thing to experience. \n\nHe is in the military and has had to move around a lot. He thought he had a timeline down that it would happen each time he moved to a new place. He did have an episode at his current home already so he didn’t expect to have another. Nor did he expect what happened this time. \n\nHe told me that he was having the same sleep paralysis where the figure is standing over him. But then he said all of a sudden, he was outside of his body watching it happen. He said he was mumbling in his sleep with the figure standing over him. His wife was trying to wake him up because his struggling in his sleep woke her up. All while he’s watching it. He thought to himself, I’m going to mess this thing up because it’s messing with me. So he yelled at it to get it’s attention. It turned and looked right at him. He started forward as to grab it and then just at he was reaching out for it, said he was back in his body and his wife woke him up. \n\nHe thought he was having a second layer dream. His words anyway. I’ve not heard of that term before. But this sounds more like astral projection to me. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this, especially during a sleep paralysis episode?  He’s a very normal and logical person and understands sleep paralysis. But he’s never had a dream like this or out of body experience before.",

She next day tell us how, as she was sitting there and watching tv, heared trough closed doors footsteps of a small kid in the entrance room. She heares those footsteps comming towards her but stopping in front of the closes doors.

I would notice things were strangely on the floor like a stuffed animal or her white noise machine. I know this seems rather innocuous, and it seemed that way to me too. Until I saw it actually happen. I was standing in the nursery holding my daughter when the baby monitor fell to the floor. It would actually be more accurate to say it looked like it was pushed off the ledge it sits on, and it hit the ground a few feet away, rather than directly underneath where it sits as you would expect something falling on its own to do.\nAnd just now I heard a loud noise on the baby monitor, and on the corner of the video feed you can see a large package of formula in her closet fall to the floor. The package is of tins of formula, not something that tips over easily. I'm getting concerned that whatever was happening before is back in some way. And it scares me that my baby seems to be at the center of this.",

        "text": "Obligatory english isn’t my first language, am on mobile sorry for format, yadda yadda preface.\n\n\nTo add some context, my dad isn’t a very big believer of the paranormal, not a huge skeptic but he tends to take things with a grain of salt, and looks for the logical explanation first and foremost. He’s a very straight to the point type of man, no time to add frill or useless details to things. And although he was on good terms with my grandpa, they were never really close since my dad doesn’t like social interactions and tends to isolate himself. Nevertheless, my grandpa always told me he was glad my mom had found my dad, since he knew he takes good care of her and loves her dearly.\n\n\nOn the 21st of December, my dad was standing at work while on break, he had a can of coke in his jacket’s inside pocket at chest level, and started feeling like something was constricting him a bit. Not in a “am about to be crushed to death” way, more so in a “bear hug” way. It only lasted a second or so, almost a “blink and you’ll miss it” moment, but as it happened, the coke that was in his jacket just randomly ended up bursting. He was only wearing a plain white t-shirt under his jacket, with nothing pointy or sharp that could’ve made the can burst on it, and has been putting his cans of coke in his chest pockets for years. This has never happened before. He works with my brothers, and they were both also very confused as to what could’ve caused that. He received a call from my mom who was crying on the phone about 10-15 minutes later, telling him my grandpa had just passed away. \n\n\n\nMy grandpa was an absolutely wonderful gem of a man, and I wouldn’t put it past him to do something like this, if anything it could’ve been to give my mom (who’s a very spiritual person) a physical sign that his passing wasn’t rushed, and that he got to say his goodbyes in a way? He passed at home in his sleep after suffering from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease for 7-8 years, so it really wasn’t a rushed or violent death.\n\n\n\nI’m still not really sure what to think of it to be completely honest, I guess it could’ve been a really odd coincidence, but it just feels like it was a bit more than that to me.",

        "text": "Hello all, long time reader and first time posting on here but I feel I need help piecing this together. Last night as I was laying in bed with my girlfriend and I heard a bang outside around 2:45ish. Now this is typical living in a rural area as it could have been a number of different animals. Though it was enough to get me out of bed to check just in case. The first time I walked into the living room and peered out of the door I saw nothing but a chair that was knocked over. Again nothing atypical from the norm. When I climbed back in bed I was wide awake. I decided to turn on a movie until I was tired again. I didn’t get the chance to turn up the TV when I heard it. 3 distinct taps on one of the window on the back side of our house. I was instantly hit with fight or flight. And like the fool I am, I chose fight,(for context I live with my GF, her mom, and brother. And I will be damned if I let anything happen to them) I ran outside arming myself with the chair on the front porch that had previously been knocked over and start looking for the late night predator that decided to make itself known. Barefoot and half naked I walked through our yard looking for footprints in the freshly fallen snow but saw nothing but my own. I felt vulnerable being outside with no shoes, I was in no shape for a fight I did see someone, so I snuck back in the house trying not to wake anyone else. But I decided to wake my GF to see if she had heard it but I was only me. I crawled back in bed and no more than 10 minutes later. A second set of knocks came. Once again 3 knocks this time louder than the first. Loud enough for myself, my gf and her mom to hear. I took of now prepared with clothes shoes and a golf club. I was prepared to stop this by any means necessary. I felt like a trapped dog ready to pounce, filled with fear and anger. I searched our entire property and our neighbors property (we are very close with our neighbors so I wanted to make sure they were okay too). I searched between the two properties for the upwards of an hours looking for ANY kind of tracks in the snow and found nothing. It was like it didn’t exist. No entry or exit. I know what I heard, I know something had to have knocked. I feel like I’m going crazy because I can’t find any answers. I’ve also been seeing the number 13 everywhere and I don’t know if the two are connected. I’ve read that I might be marked for death. If anyone can bring insight for me I would be truly grateful. Thank you.",

        "text": "When i was in middle school i had a couple of experiences which i've mostly just blown off but i still question them to this day.\nFirst one was when I visited this cemetery by my house with a friend at night. we snuck in and were walking around and we start feeling different presences as we are walking by graves. I didn't say anything at first but after a couple graves I hear something that sound like scratching and moaning for help. I turn around to walk away and my friend asks \"do you hear that?\" She explains that she hears someone scratching so we decided to walk around some more but we both keep feeling like someone is forcing emotions on us. We would walk by one and feel angered and another one would feel sad and grief as if we were feeling how these people felt in their last moments. There is the one grave plot that has a stone perimeter with a small black bench inside and a gate. We both hear quiet sobbing and look over and see a womens head crying into her hands. At that point we decided it would be best to leave but to leave we have to walk past that plot. When we walk past and turn around she had disappeared completely and it was silent. We start walking towards the hole in the fence faster and behind us we see different sized figures of different colors from black to white to gray and they're all walking towards us pretty fast. We run out of there and back to my house and we have never spoke of it again.\nMy second memorable experience was when I was at another friends house and her mom took us to get snacks and when we got back around 9pm we walked in the house and their very friendly shut dog has destroyed the whole house.(im talking the place looked like it got raided) as were cleaning up their front gate starts to swing open and closed then stops and starts back up again after a couple minutes and their porch light is flickering. (it was a very peaceful night not a cloud in sight and not a single breeze) as my friend and i are cleaning up her room her calls us to the living room and the moment I walk in there I feel ice cold and as if someone is trying to pull me down to the ground. I sit in the couch as her mom pours salt around the perimeter of the house (very superstitious women) she tried to get their dog to walk out the back door but she was refusing to move at all and was just staring out the door. Very quickly I see a black figure about 6'5 with glowing eyes slip thru the door into their kitchen around the corner. I decide to go home after that.\nThe third experience was when I visited my dads aunt in the nursing home for the first time. ik that she was old and almost dead so she didn't exactly understand anything but when she saw me the first thing she said was \"Amal\" (my dads father who offed himself when ny dad was 13)i brushed it off as she was old and dying but later that day we visited his grave and while my mom was cleaning up with grave a bird kept following me and would not leave me alone and once again i brushed it off as nature. About a year later i went downstairs into the kitchen to get water at around 2am and I saw my grandfather just sitting on the couch looking forward. He turned his head towards me and said \"im sorry I wasn't a better father.\" I brushed it off as me being tired and had just woken up. later in the morning when everybody was up my dad told me that it was his fathers birthday. To this day 5 years later I still haven't told him what I saw. But my grandmother later in the year visited and I overheard her telling my dad \"I had a very vivid dream of your father last night and he told me he is sorry for the way he treated us.\"\nThere are obviously explanations for all of this but these are some of my more memorable experiences which I think about from time to time and question if I was just going crazy.\nfeel free to give me your opinions because I just keep thinking about these and feel crazy. or if you can offer and solutions of explanations those are welcomed too.",

        "text": "So this situation happened about 2 years ago, it was summertime, and my dog has always been a sweet boy, but never super affectionate. He would occasionally cuddle but for the most part, he liked to be on his own. Until one day, during the night (I don't recall the time) he barked and growled to get into my room (I always sleep with the door shut), so I decided to let him in because I became concerned. As soon as I let him in he begged to be picked up onto my bed, and as soon as I did that, he started to circle around me. I recorded video footage of this because it was THAT bizarre. He would start at my chest, walk across me, circle back to my head, sit, and stare. He would repeat this process multiple times and would not leave my side. My mom had stood in my doorway just as concerned as I was, because he would not leave me alone. I was feeling very uneasy and quite worried something was wrong with him. He slept by my side that night, continuously circling my head. I eventually fell asleep due to exhaustion. \n\nThe next morning he would either lay his head on my chest, or crawl onto my lap and just sit and stare at my door. This happened for about a week or so, and it happened on 3 occassions-- all the same, lasting for a week or so. \n\nI hadn't done anything to provoke any spirits, I hadn't done anything out of the ordinary whatsoever, but it just felt like something was off. I was so worried about what he could have been protecting me from? Though I was mainly worried that he was maybe sick, so I brought him to the vet and I even called the emergency vet hospital the first night this happened telling them in detail what behavior he was exhibiting. They both had no explanation, and just insisted he was fine. I told a coworker about this, whom was experienced and gifted, she told me she saw something attached to me but couldn't tell if it was good or evil. She advised I place a cross on the inside of every door in the house, but I never did. \n\nI am wondering what your thoughts are, if any one has any experience, or has had anything similar happen to them.",

On the island, all the branches were down it was mature with trees so we always built a hut. But after a week, strange things suddenly happened. It started small Our cabins were demolished and we saw footsteps on the ground.  There were dead birds on the ground and when we went to school we sometimes saw someone standing. But on closer inspection, it was gone.\n\nOne day we went to the island with a large group. We were 20 people and we wanted to discover the island more. When almost half the people on the island were we heard a noise. 2 of the boys heard someone breathing heavily behind him. But no one was behind them. Suddenly there was a creak and we heard footsteps. Everyone ran to the branch to get off the island. We never went back to the island after that. 3 years ago the branches were sawn off so that we could no longer go on the island. Occasionally I cycle past it in the evening and I hear the rustling again and I hear cracks breaking. And sometimes in the distance, I see someone on the island but when I get closer it's gone. Often when I tell someone this story to people who weren't there, they don't believe me. That's why I put it here on this Reddit because you all believe in the paranormal and I also changed that it happened. Do you maybe know what it was?",

        "text": "This happened when I was only around 8 or 9. My father and I went to Dukes Farm in NJ for a Cub Scout event. \n\nAfter the event, we walked around the estate with a friend and his father. We were walking by the stables, and there was this mansion (now removed) behind these gates. We all decide it would be fun to see what it was all about, so we went past the gates.\n\nI started getting this anxious feeling when we entered the gates, but I presumed it was from entering a restricted area and not wanting to break the rules. \n\nAs we got closer to this mansion, I get this horrifying feeling of terror, and start crying and begging my dad to leave. At the time, I didn’t know why this was happening, and was scared for my life. \n\nYears later, my father tells me his experience from that day. According to him, he froze in fear as well. He described it as “evil entering him”, and apparently told the evil “I am a follower of god, he will protect me”. He was scared as well, but not as worried as me. We got out of there as quickly as we could, and kind of brushed the experience off.\n\n\nHe didn’t want to tell me this until a few years ago because he didn’t want to scare me as a child. \n\nI’ve never been crazy into religion, and I’m  very skeptical when it comes to paranormal experiences like this. But this experience was very real to me, and opened my eyes to what might be out there.",

        "text": "ok, i don't really care if you believe me or not, but i think i know what i saw (kinda).\n\nso i am from a small country called, denmark. also i went to a school in a forest. the buildings are over 130 years old and with a lot of history. i know the buildings were apart of an asylum that is in my city. also a tuberculosis treatment center years ago. the school has a lot of ghouls and ghosts activity. i am not the only one with stories there. my teachers and other studends have heard, seen and felt things there.\n\nat the time of the experience, i was a 11-12 year old girl. and this is not a joke, but i had to be there at 6 in the morning because my dad worked an hour and a half away and he had to be there at 7:30AM. he also didn't trust me to stay alone or have a key to the house so i had to leave the same time he did, which was around 5:45AM. the school start at 9AM, so there is alot of time to kill. volunteers and D.I.S would have to take care of me. sometimes they would forget about me (which happened alot more then it should have) when that happened i would go in to the forest and take a long walk. (my school also had dogs) and sometimes i would take the dogs with me.\n\nthat day was one of the days, they forgot about me, so i walked into the forest, without the dogs that day, it was also before i had a phone, so i couldn't just stay on that until 9. it was also in the winter, so it was dark. i knew/know the forest like the back of my hand, so i wasn't scared to do this.\n\nbut i walked into the forest and walked for about 15 minutes when i started to feel something. i felt watched. i have felt watched before but not like this. it felt strangely dark and ominous. but i didn't think much of it really, but i should have, then i felt followed, i saw a very dark shadowy thing deck behind a tree. i felt a little scared, but kept walking.\n\ni walked for another 5 minutes, that's when i heard something behind me, i looked and saw nothing, i turned back around and i saw it.\n\na man, at least 7-8 feet tall, what looked like a suit and a very pale face was staring right at me.\n\nnow i know what you are gonna say: 'how can you see that when it is dark out!?' well my dear reader, i have really good eyesight in the dark.\n\nit also looked like it was moving, but i couldn't tell what way it was moving. i also didn't stay to find out, i ran as fast as my little legs could carry me and ran back to the school, but when i ran i heard an ear piercing growl. it was not loud, but it was very demonic and dark. when i get back to the school, i kinda sat down and i cried, i had NO IDEA what i saw. this was before i heard or saw anything about slenderman. this was after 2009, when he popped up, but again, i hadn't heard anything about him before. until about 3 years after seeing that, when i read about the slenderman stabbing. i googled him and i read somethings and that's when i knew what i saw, i think i saw slenderman. but i am still not 100% sure about it.\n\ntell me what you think please!\n\ni am 21 now and i have so many experience on that school and i wanna tell them. you rarely hear about ghost stories in denmark, but it does happen and i wanna share what i have been through.\n\nanyways, have a great day and/or and night. thanks for reading!",

        "text": "So my husband and I bought some small LED Christmas lights from Walmart and hung them on the top of our wooden headboard a few nights ago. I usually keep them on throughout the night until we are officially ready to close our eyes and sleep. Well, both of us got up a few hours ago to grab some food and have just been hanging out in the pitch black, cuddling, or watching videos on our phones. Well, my husband was lying on his side facing our sliding glass door to the porch, and I was lying on my back, listening to a sleep meditation with my eyes open. Suddenly, the Christmas lights turn on. At first I didn't realize what was going on, but then I told my husband to look and explained that I didn't touch them, and that they are BATTERY OPERATED, with a soft plastic button you have to push in, in order to turn them on. I grabbed the cord to see where it led,and the battery case/button is set nicely on the shelf located on my side of the headboard, all by itself. Needless to say, I'm thoroughly creeped out, and so is my very masculine, not-easily- intimated- husband. \n  Backstory- the real-estate agent that helped our family find this house, informed my mother in law that the couple that lived here before us, would get the cops called on them ALL the time for domestic disputes, noise complaints, &amp; welfare checks. The neighbors would hear them scream and yell and act completely hateful and almost homicidal to one another. The month that the couple split up, and as far as I've been told, &amp; moved out of the house, the husband (whom was alleged as the primary aggressor) took his own life. No one other than my family has lived here since, but everyone that lives here (and some who don't) have either experienced something bizarre, noted some kind of dark energy/ mood swings/ anxiety/seen things move or turn off by themselves. \nI'm not saying for sure that the previous couple, and the UNDENIABLE bad aura surrounding this house, are related, but based off of my own experiences in the past year of living here, it's too coincidental for my liking. \nMy husband and I are newly married (10/24/22), and I'm also 6 months pregnant, but we have known each other since we were 12 and 13. (I'm 26, he's 27) We have had our differences and have obviously gotten on each other's nerves before we lived here, but since moving in, we have become different at times. The way we fight has changed completely, and it's scary. I'll spare the minor details of that for now, but I have never seen or heard my husband or myself behave in ways that we have towards each other before this. Some of that, I believe, is due to stress, but we have become aggressive, hateful, irrational, and impulsive. Just clouded with anger for no reason sometimes. I genuinely think whatever is turning my christmas lights on, is causing my recurring nightmares, making me and the man I love behave like barbarians, and maybe adding to the cause of my prenatal depression. \n  Help me. Any advice is welcome.",

I went inside it, walked around, opened some doors, and it was all empty. I went back outside and she was gone. I was confused, then I woke up. \n\nIn real life, I felt uneasy. I checked her Facebook that afternoon and found out she had died a few days prior. I was very distressed and wept. I said my goodbye by leaving a drawing on her wall, which her family used in her obituary. I took it as a sign to get out of my art block and start sharing my drawings again (she used to lecture me for being shy about it). \n\nLast night I dreamt about her again. I thought she was alive and hugged her. It felt so real and we talked. I told her how much she inspired and helped me. She mostly just smiled and listened. I asked, “how did you feel about everyone who said goodbye??” She said, “I was surprised.”\n\n\nI woke up and realized she was still gone. I cried again. I just wanted to reach out here in case someone else has had an experience like this. I miss my friend",

        "text": "I'm very confused, I don't really believe in ghosts but I wish I had an answer for what happened last night.\nAt around 3:30am, while in bed with my wife, half asleep, I heard the strings of my guitar being strummed before the guitar fell (quite heavily), making a loud noise. This guitar was leaning in an angle between a furniture and the wall, it's been like this for months and no one has touched or moved it recently so there was no reason for it to fall at this particular moment, I've had that guitar for over 10 years and it never fell.\nAnyway, I woke up and decided to go to the bathroom to get some water and the scene was straight out of a nightmare. A pipe of the shower had been damaged (I don't know what happened yet, it almost looked like too much pressure made it explode or something) and water was spraying everywhere, the bathroom was completely flooded. So I cut the water off and found the lower floor flooded as well with parts of the ceiling peeling off.\n\nThe only reason I woke up and went to the bathroom was because of the guitar's loud noise. I'm so confused, what would have happened if I hadn't gotten up? \n\nAlso, I watched very carefully the way the guitar ended up on the ground and tried to recreate the way it could've fallen. I swear, there is no way it could've fallen without some force interacting with it, especially in the position I found it. And I didn't manage to explain the strumming either, it makes no sense.\n\nI'd like to point out that I don't see how the guitar and the pipe breaking could've been linked, I was half asleep (but conscious) and felt no shaking or earthquake or whatever, and when the guitar fell the pipe was already broken for some time.\n\nWhen I woke up to go to work around 6:30, I'm pretty sure I heard some kind of music coming from my bedroom while I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth, I went to the room and there was no music, I asked my wife if she heard it or if she had an alarm on or something, she said she didn't hear anything. Maybe I just have a lack of sleep, I don't know...\n\nPlease share your thoughts.",

With that being said, this morning I was getting ready for school, as I usually do, and I heard a singular beep. I brushed it off as nothing until I heard 3 beeps, one after the other. After hearing the beeps I decided to take a look. I assumed it was our fire alarm, but as I entered the kitchen (where the beep was coming from) I noticed our fire alarms were not on the roof. As soon as I walked in the room the beeping stoped, but after about 5 minutes of searching I heard the same pattern of beeps coming from upstairs. I quickly go upstairs and the beep pattern happened in the kitchen again. I ran to the kitchen in hopes to find where the beep was coming from and while in my way to the kitchen, it beeped a singular time upstairs. I could not find the device that was making the noises upstairs or in the kitchens. I want to think that it’s my dad assuring us that he hid here with us but i’m not sure.

There have been many reports dating back almost 100 years of a \"White Lady\" that haunts the mountain, specifically a turn called the devil's elbow. The story is she and her just married husband were driving on the road when they crashed their buggy, the husband was beheaded and the wife was so distraught that she wandered into the woods never to be seen alive again. Now when people go up there, a woman in white will stop them and ask for a ride, once in the car they can see her if they look in the back, but if they look through the rear view mirror she is gone. As far as I know this is the only ghost of Wopsy Mountain.\n\nHere is where my Father's story comes in and I really just wanna see if any one else has seen it in the area or seen anything else like it in general. My father and Uncle went up on the mountain at night today to see if they could spot the white lady, they didn't. What they did see was a tall old man with dark eyes wearing a black trench coast, a white under shirt, long black pants, and striped socks. They said he looked kind of like an old stage coach driver from around the period of the white lady. Both my dad and Uncle are \"manly men\" who aren't afraid of anything, but when that creepy old man started to gesture for them to stop the car they promptly said \"oh hell no!\" and sped off. What is a bit off putting is that my dad is going for a heart surgery tomorrow, and he sees something like that right beforehand. That's not offsetting at all. \n\nHas anyone else seen something like this.",

        "text": "So this happened about three years ago during peak Covid and quarantine. I still think back on it a lot..trying to rationalize what happened. Most I could have written off as night terrors except for one detail that I still can’t explain. \n\nIt was a typical night for me. Done with work (I worked from home) I finished my nighttime routine and laid down on my back in my bed. Soon I was fast asleep. Now I do suffer from the occasional night terrors but something about this time felt different.\n\nIf you’ve ever gotten night terrors you know  the standard. Your frozen in bed while something is looming over you, getting closer, overall a feeling of terror and lack of control. But this wasn’t that. I remember kind of waking up in the middle of night to the feeling of being weightless, like I was floating. I stared up at my ceiling and it kept getting slowly closer, that’s when I realized I was floating. But I remember feeling oddly relaxed about it all…\n\nI floated up to the ceiling and then through it. Now it was pitch black, I wasn’t able to make out anything but what looked like a human skull floating over me. As I focused more on this skull is when my freak out began. Because it wasn’t a skull, it was a giant alien head. I knew it was an alien because it had your standard alien features. It’s skin was blue and it’s face gaunt. Two huge eyes protruded from the biggest head you’ve ever seen. Like it’s head was the size of my entire torso. Anyway, as soon it saw the look of realization hit my face it picked me up like a baby and puts it’s mouth on belly button, kind of like how you do to babies to make them giggle. I felt no ill intent and it seemed to be enjoying itself. The blowing didn’t last too long as I began to try to hit its head with my fists during my freak out. \n\nThen, I woke up. It was morning and this is the one detail I still can’t explain. I had grown accustomed to setting my alarm 30 min before I was required to clock in. So I would get up at 8:30 before 9:00 clock in. Just enough time to brush my teeth and have some breakfast. I had been doing this for a while and could time it pretty well if say, for example, I was doing something where I couldn’t watch the clock, my body knew how much time I had left before clocking in.\n\nSo my alarm goes off and for whatever reason and do my usual practice of starting up my laptop. My phone said 8:35 but when I turned on my laptop it was showing 8:50. That would mean I only had 10 minutes. I thought maybe it was just a glitch in the laptop and decided to wait 10 minutes to see if anyone would clock in. If it was just a laptop delay than  no one would clock in and my phone was right. Except everybody did. That’s when I realized my phone was actually behind about 20 minutes…like it had stopped for a while at some point during the night. So I clock in and check my phone again after an hour or so and realized my phone time matched my laptop’s,\nLike it caught up 20 minutes somehow. That’s the detail that doesn’t sit well with me. My phone had always been my accurate alarm, it never did this before, and  even though what happened was still kind of blurry to me, it seemed odd that my phone’s time would stop after what happened that night. I dunno I try not to read too much in to it cuz it creeps me out. If anyone has any idea as to what could have happened I would greatly appreciate the breath of relief it would give.",

        "text": "Last spring when my son was 3 years old, we drove by a big white church. This church is one that we pass often driving around town. It is also the place of his current preschool, but at that time, he attended a different preschool and had NEVER stepped foot in or talked about the big white church. \n\nSo we drove by one day and he said “oh there’s the church that I ate cereal in”. My husband and I looked at each other and I said, “what do you mean? We’ve never been there before”. We asked some additional questions but he didn’t really answer. However, he was very adamant about being there and eating cereal. \n\nThis happened during a very difficult time\nin our lives. My father in law was on hospice and dying of cancer. For weeks, we were up and back to my in laws house- this church being along the route. He said it a few more times and then never mentioned it again. \n\nFast forward to today- he currently attends preschool at said church.  He has been going since September and we love it. It is Christian though we aren’t very religious. Anyway, I got the monthly newsletter and it mentioned that next month is pajama day where the kids wear pajamas and….eat cereal. \n\nI told my son and asked him if he remembered eating cereal there before. He said no and had no recollection of saying that he did.\n\nIs there an explanation to this? It gives me chills when I think about it.",

The old lady and it's burning cabin behind my house, the girls that smells like flowers and barely lets herself seen and the shadow man that looks at me from the distance, specially from the corner of my door in my bedroom.\n\nIt's been like 2 months since I haven't seen any of this entities and at first I thought it was weird but I got used to it because the sensation of constant fear went away and made me feel happy. Now it's been a few days since I've felt really bad headaches, chills and constant feeling of chocking at night. I have no idea of what is going on and why I talk about it now?\n\nWell, a few moments ago I was preparing tomorrows lunch and my father went to get my food bag. It's gone, we can't find it even tho we knew where it was. My parents think that maybe my sister took it by accident, but my mom kept looking for it and went to the attic to see if it was there which it wasn't. When se came downstairs she said that one of my boxes was on the floor (most of my stuff is in boxes up there because when changed my room furniture and didn't have time to move all my stuff).\n\nI went up to clean it up and when I saw what box was I got the chills. The box contained all my favorite figurines: a fairy that had one broken wing, a fantastic creature I made at Arts Highschool that was a project, a potion I made for a Minecraft cosplay, pirates gold that I bought at a esoteric store,  some toy cars and a little skull with devil horns I got at a bowling place with my friends. This box is really special for me since everything on it has a special memory or meaning.\n\nThis box was located on top of 2 huge boxes on top of a cabinet, but I found the box 2m away from where it was originally. The fairy and the fantastic creature landed perfectly on their bases but both where broken, fairy had other wing broken and the arts project had one of its tails broken. Everything else was fine, even the potion which is in a cristal bottle.\n\nThis is so weird and now I have a feeling of as it something was coming for me. When I saw the broken things I had a panic attack and felts as if everything stopped for a moment, I also felt that there was someone in the attic with me but nobody was with me. I heard a voice mumbling but I couldn't understand what it said and as soon as that happened I went down with all the important stuff of the box and left it on the kitchen.\n\nI need someone to help me find a solution to this, I'm scared and it's the first time I feel like this, I've had a lot of encounters with spirits but this feels different. Not only that, my dreams and flashbacks of one of my ancestors are coming back, I mostly get them by a connection with the elements such as water or fire. I don't know if this has anything to do with this. In case you wonder what my religion is or it could help you to help me, it's viking but in my country we call it Ásatrú.\n\nPlease help me, I'm desperate to know for once and for all what's going on.",

        "text": "Me and my family recently returned to New Zealand to visit family. this was our first time back in 7 years so we planned a road trip up to a place called Rotorua. This is known for natural hot springs and motels. we booked 2 nights in a motel by the name of the 'Coachman Spa Motel'. \n\nWe arrived the first day and were very tired from the long drive the day before. This first night seemed very uneventful but we had booked the largest room at the motel which we were told could sleep 20 but we only had 6 of us on the trip. me, my mum, dad, brother, nan and my pop. I felt very alone in the upstairs of the room but despite this i still felt uneasy.\n\nFast forward to the next night and everyone had gone to sleep. We had a busy day of swimming and walking some nice hilly trails. Everyone had gone to bed and me and my mum decided to have a drink in the living room. The living room opened up to the kitchen-diner combo through a mesh door. Me and my mum were chatting away on the couch when we heard a loud crash come from the kitchen. We were caught off guard and my mum just told me that it was the dishes in the sink crashing. It sounded exactly like this. \n\nThat same night, i slept on the spare mattress in my brothers room as i felt uneasy for no apparent reason. Of a night i take 6mg of melatonin which helps me usually sleep right through but this night i woke randomly. I thought nothing of this as it happens from time to time but something was wrong. i lay in my bed and starred at the ceiling. I checked the time and it was about 3:30 in the morning. We had a long drive in the morning so i took another 2mg of melatonin. I wanted to use the bathroom but i had an overwhelming feeling of dread. I lay motionless in my bed unsure of what to do and just observed my surroundings. It was now about 4am and i hid beneath the covers until i passed out of exhaustion.\n\nThe next morning my mum came to me and asked me if anything felt off last night. We knew straight away that we had both experienced the same thing. She told me that when we were in the living room drinking that there were no dishes in the sink as she had washed up. My mum was visibly shook and told me she kept quiet as she did not want to alarm me. My mum and dad sleep separately but the had both talked to me that they too woke up around 4am and felt extremely unwelcome and as though they were being observed by another force.\n\nWriting this up now brings genuine shivers down my spine and it has been plaguing my mind recently.",

        "text": "\nThis is a true story told to me by my family who live in Tanzania. It may sound nutty and strange to a lot of people, I myself couldn’t believe it when I was told by my family, but it is true and something that still happens (a bit rare now though) in the country of Tanzania. \n\nA short brief about Tanzania and Africa in regards to the paranormal. Africans are huge believers of the paranormal, devils, demons, superstitious beings and the like. This culture has also influenced the use of magic and establishing a connection with demons and devils, many (usually smaller) African villages and towns will often have a witch doctor/wizard/witch who try to scam people for money by “predicting” their future and such. Anyway, I feel it’s important to talk about this culture before I begin the story because belief and presence of the paranormal is taken very seriously in Tanzania, it’s quite a sensitive topic. \n\nThe Mwanga people of Tanzania are a very strange group of magicians who their motives are unknown to the general public. They are quite known in the rural towns and usually villages of the country, not so much the cities. These people, are human beings, just like me and you, who have to take part in some magic/ritual in order to be accepted into the Mwanga community. Yes I say community because they are quite a few of them, enough to form a community. However, not much is known about them and NO ONE knows who they are. My aunt could be a Mwanga and I would never know. I must say, not so much is known about them because they are a very low-key group of magicians and you will never see them, if you do, then it would be a traumatic experience(i’ll talk about this later).\n\n\nNow this is where it gets strange, what exactly is a Mwanga? what do they do? Mwangas’ are human magicians who are active late at night, with the help of their magic, they are invisible, that’s why we cannot see them and we do not know who they are. I know it’s unbelievable, but yes, they are invisible human beings at night. Also, if you DO see them, they will be naked. Mwangas’ go to cemeteries and dig up, and eat the dead bodies of the buried. But their method of transportation to the cemeteries is the creepy part. \n\nThey enter homes, and perform their magic on sleeping victims. If their magic has been performed to you while you are asleep, you will not feel a thing, but will do as they command. They will command you to get on all fours, like an animal, and they will mount you like a donkey. If their magic has been performed to you, you will be oblivious the entire night and will also be invisible. Once the Mwanga has mounted you, he/she will command you to take them to a cemetery, so they can proceed to eat dead bodies. They will be on your back, as you are on your knees and hands moving like a donkey, all the way to the cemetery. \n\nOnce they have finished with whatever it is they do in the cemetery, they will take you back to your home, still mounting you, and ensure you return to your bed, and they leave. The next morning, you will feel broken and tired because of the pressure on your knees and back from the Mwanga mounting you. You will have no idea what happened, because their magic will make you oblivious. \n\nAgain, you and the Mwanga will not be seen by anyone throughout this journey due to their magic of making both of you invisible. They also ride you as they are naked. People who believe in such things will know they have fallen victim to a Mwanga if they wake up feeling broken, and feel pressure on their joints and back. \n\nThe strange part is, this is absolutely strange, even to the locals. Because, what the hell is their motive? why do they enter homes and ride people only to eat dead bodies at the cemetery? I have asked the same questions to my Uncle who has told me the story but could not get a reply. Until today, this phenomenon of the Mwanga behavior has not been explained. There is not enough information because these magicians are extremely discreet.\n\nHowever, to be accepted to become a Mwanga, some things are known by the general public. First of all, no one knows where to find the concerned person/group of the Mwanga community to request to join them, I guess if you are creepy enough and determined to join them, you will find a way. \n\nSecond, if you have passed their initiation or whatever, there are 3 strict rules that Mwangas’ must follow. The Mwangas’ are not allowed to steal from their victim or harm them in anyway. If they do this, they will be exposed by their community and either punished badly in some way or banished, I guess this abides to their motive of being very discreet. They are also not allowed to be exposed or seen by their victims or the general public, which is why they perform their magic to become unseen. \n\nAnd third, (which I find the creepiest) they are only allowed to enter their victims homes through a corner, they do not break into the home or pick the lock or enter through the doors/windows, this is for some reason prohibited by the Mwanga community. They use some sort of magic, to enter your room through any corner, so a 90 degree point in your room. I find this extremely creepy because i honestly believe in the Mwangas to some extent because I lived in Tanzania and have personally seen some paranormal shit there myself. And to know that these people use magic to enter your room non-violently and silently, has made me very creeped out.\nAlso, I would like to add that if you have a light on in your room, they will never come to you. They only come in the dark. \n\nThe Mwangas’ have been present for quite a few centuries, and the Africans who knew about them long ago, have found the secret to keep them away. They build their homes (usually small homes during those times) in the shape of a circle, which means the Mwanga has no place to enter from a corner, and thus cannot enter the home. If you look at some of the old Tanzanian village homes, and still some to this day too, some people build their little village homes (made out of mud) in the shape of a circle just for this reason. \n\nMy uncle told me a very vague story that happened long ago about his friend who once entered his mothers room to find his grandmother performing Mwanga magic on his mother, she somehow ran away (very vague explanation). Turns out his grandmother was a Mwanga and was going to take her for a ride to the cemetery that might. I believe the Mwanga magic somehow does not work in homes as he could see his grandmother as she wasn’t invisible. \n\nAnyway, I felt like sharing this story here because it really intrigued me and creeped me out. I would just like to say that Mwangas are quite rare at this time but maybe because we don’t here about them much, idk. Again, they are very discreet and strange.",

I was around 5 he was 7 I think. We would go inside and tell my parent we were playing with baby bats but I remember them being fuzzy balls!!!! But when we held them it didn’t feel like anything was in our hands. Super weird!! If soot sprites aren’t real what the heck were we touching?? Could it really have been baby bats?! I know that’s a dumb question. But what the heck!!",

        "text": "This happened to me about an hour ago. I was walking my dog and we were walking down the street of the neighbourhood I live in. I then heard an owl making their typical noise. I then walked further with my dog through the neighbourhood with the owl assumingly constantly moving, eventhough there were no real trees. I followed the sound further, because I have a personal connection to them. After many direction changes I found myself down at the forests edge. When arrived there and standing before the dark entrance the owl was gone and a creepy crawling could be heard, which was faster than it should have been and being directed towards me coming from deep inside the woods. Then I heard the owl again, hooting from the direction the strange approaching crawling sounds came from. My dog then became terrified and started threateninh whatever was lurking in the darkness. At that point, because the crawling became even more faster and unsettling I sprinted backwards around thirty meters and turn around to see if something was behind me. Then it was the owl again, as if telling me come back. When I told my dog that we will head home, after that a distorted laughter was what I heard, a laughter not human. After that I headed straight home and locked all doors. It was and is night here. \nThank you for reading and please share your thoughts on the matter.",

        "text": "This happened just over a decade ago while my husband and I were still living in his tiny 1 bedroom apartment.  \n\nWith it being an apartment, in a busy part of town, we were used to hearing noises at night.   Whether it was our back neighbor reliving his 80s rock band days, the lower tenant setting off the buildings fire alarm baking hamburgers too long, or the numerous fights between patrons of the bar next door.   We were so accustomed to the sounds of that street, that I didn't even notice the building two doors down had burned down until I saw it the next morning.   The lights, sirens, and commotion must have all blended into the background.   Prior to this one night, I would have said that nothing could wake us up.\n\nSomething did. \n\nMy dreams almost always take place in settings from my past. Like former workplaces or the house I grew up in - hardly ever in the place I currently work or live.   So that was the first thing I noticed was strange about this nightmare.   \n\nIt was short, but I remember it very vividly.  I \"woke up\" to the sound of loud banging at our apartment door.  However the first thing I saw when I \"opened my eyes\" was the sliding closet doors of our bedroom covered in scripture I didn't recognize.  It was like someone was using a projector, as it was illuminated.  I couldn't make out any of the symbols, but they looked like a handwritten, bold, mix of hindi and hebrew, and it covered the entire closet doors.   Panicked, I got up, ran to the door, which was just outside our bedroom, heard the banging again, reached for the doorknob, and then I suddenly woke up for real.\n\nAt first, I was relieved.  I was in bed, the strange text was gone, and there was no loud banging. It was just a bad dream. As I was about to lay down and go back to sleep, my husband started tossing and turning in the bed beside me.  He was making these God awful moaning and groaning sounds.  It wasn't the usual noises people make when they're being woken up in the middle of the night.  It was unlike any sounds I have heard come out of him before or since. I knew he was in some sort of distress, and that I needed to wake him up. \n\n\nI gently started nudging him, telling him to wake up.  I was half expecting him to get annoyed that I woke him, and was mentally preparing to explain that I was worried about him, when he suddenly startled awake.  Instead of asking me what was wrong, which he would normally do whenever I did need to wake him for something, his first words were \"Oh thank God!\".   I immediately went to apologizing, saying \"sorry, it looked like you were freaking out in your sleep\".  \n\n\"I was.  I had a dream someone was trying to break into the apartment and you were trying to open the door. I was screaming at you to stop, but you didn't hear me.   I couldnt move, I couldn't wake up.\" \n\n\nObviously, I told him that I had pretty much the same dream.  It was mutually decided that neither of us were going back to sleep any time soon, so we got up and started comparing notes, trying to make sense of it all.\n\nNeither of us are religious or spiritual people.  We both look for logical explanations for things that aren't easily explained.   We agree with the theory that dreams are our brains processing memories and preparing us for upcoming events.  Like when I was pregnant, I had dreams about being a mom.  I also have reoccurring dreams about working for a company that I had left on very bad terms.     We are also aware of sleep stages and sleep paralysis. Our brains paralyze us so we don't act out our dreams, and sometimes people can wake up before we fully regain our mobility. \n\nWe came to the reasonable conclusion that there was likely someone trying to get into our apartment.  Maybe some drunk guy from the bar next door mistook our apartment for one of our neighbors.    We also agreed that my husband was stuck in some stage between sleep and wakefulness, and he was trying to fight sleep paralysis while sleeping.  \n\nNeither of us have had a dream like this before or since.  I've never had a dream that took place in that apartment before or since.  Neither of us talk or walk in our sleep.  My husband has never consciously experienced sleep paralysis, or dreams where he couldn't move or interact with the people in his dreams.  \n\n\nWe can't explain why we dreamt the same scenario in the same setting. The only difference between his dream and mine is that he didn't see the scripture, and I didn't see him.",

        "text": "I'll start off with recounting the story as it happened and will give additional context after.\n\nI went to bed at 9PM last night (about 2-3 hours early for me) since I had missed a bunch of sleep the night before and wanted to recover some of the lost sleep. I woke up at 1:30AM and went to the bathroom, at this point nothing was out of the ordinary. I returned to my bed and fell asleep. This is where the story becomes paranormal.\n\nI didn't quite feel like I was fully awake, but was conscious again. It felt similar to sleep paralysis that I've experienced before, but not the exact same since I felt much more aware of being awake and conscious this time.\n\nI felt a presence right outside of my home in my driveway, (for reference I live in a two-story home and my bedroom is on the second-floor street side right above the main door) and it began approaching. The more it approached, the more I began slightly shivering. I clearly heard the top lock of my front door slide and click open, although the door itself made no sound of being opened - it was as if the entity I sensed was making sure I knew it was not a human intruder. I felt it continue to approach and climb the stairs, until it was outside my closed door and I could hear the floorboards creaking - perhaps a creak every few seconds, far more than normal. It went into the bathroom right next to my room and I heard the bathroom fan turn on. At this point, I could feel the presence was immensely strong and I was shivering more and more.\n\nI felt the presence enter my room through the door and begin approaching my bed until it was right beside my bed with my back facing towards it. I sleep with four pillows and I felt and heard it take the pillow behind me and gently toss it against the wall I was facing. The pillow slid slowly and gently down the wall, almost as if the entity possessed the pillow. I could feel the presence around my head as this happened, so strong that I couldn't move anything and my jaw went slack. My shivering became an intense vibrating/shaking I could feel reverberating so strongly within my skull, like the crescendo of the experience.\n\nNext, I felt the presence exit my room and I could tell I was no longer under any sort of sleep paralysis and could move freely. The bathroom fan was also no longer on, though I couldn't tell at which point it had been turned off. I still felt the presence waiting in the hall outside my door and I had a very strong impression that it wanted me to follow it, to show me something - I was torn between burning curiosity and fear.\n\nI didn't move for a few moments but somehow felt as if this presence wasn't malicious, so my nerves settled a bit. I continued to hear the floorboards creaking a lot in the hall and grabbed my phone - it was 3:45 AM when I checked. After a few minutes, the presence continued to wait, so I said aloud, \"I know you want me to follow you, but I'm too scared.\"\n\nHoly fuck. I got an immediate notification on my iPhone telling me to close my move ring for the day. I started shaking more intensely again, but not near the level of the crescendo. I stayed put and began writing all this down in the notes app, while the presence continued to wait. It gradually started to fade and by 4:05 AM I was no longer certain whether or not it was there. I texted my family group chat at 4:11 AM saying that I had just had intense sleep paralysis. My mom instantly texted back asking me if I was ok - she told me later she had just woken up a few minutes prior. She came to my room, we spoke and I explained my experience to her, but that was all the paranormal activity for the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT\n\nI had a lot of sleep paralysis as a kid, mostly around the ages of 8-12. This was a recurring malicious entity that would come into my home uninvited and instill fear in me. I eventually became braver and even furious at the entity and would immediately try to run at it full force, attack it, and cast it out whenever it visited. This decreased the frequency of the dream until it only happened maybe once or twice ever again.\n\nI've felt a loving entity once before, in church as a child - a similar feeling of a presence, except this was so immensely full of love, hope, and positive emotion, nothing like I've ever felt before or since. I believe it was the Holy Spirit, maybe an angel but I know angels were often described as frightening in the Bible.\n\nMy brother saw a ghost in our friend's house located in the countryside as a kid - he believed in the paranormal ever since this.\n\nOn my mom's side, she and all her siblings had lots of sleep paralysis as children. She also woke up screaming after feeling a cold hand touch her while sleeping when her siblings were playing with a Ouija and the Ouija said \"touch anon's mom\" She has felt a few presences (during sleep paralysis) come in our house in the past several years but she commanded them to leave in Jesus' name and has not had such a dream in a while.\n\nSome people on my mother's side of the family were tortured spiritually - I won't get into details, but some of it is pretty dark and abusive. I've heard that these sorts of things can be generational.\n\nMy father has never experienced sleep paralysis, but had one spiritual encounter in his life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I haven't even posted yet but have an edit. lol. As soon as I finished typing this up I tried to save it in a word document and my computer made the most ungodly sound I've ever heard. Like crazy loud demonic sound - I know these are caused by weird computer glitches but it's hard to believe in coincidence right now. When I tell you I flipped out so hard, the neighbours must've heard. Random lady in a car outside started eyeballing me when I went by a window which freaked me out, but she probably heard me to be honest and was freaked out herself. I had to call my brother to calm myself down.\n\nLooking into getting a crucifix for my room, am removing all mirrors, and getting a cover for my TV. Also practicing my all father prayer and doing a lot of research.\n\nQuestions I have for you all:\n\nAny similar experiences? Has anyone followed such an entity? What did it show you?\n\nWhat is the best way to protect myself? I know prayer and love and Jesus' name help\n\nI'm so burningly curious about what this being wants to show me but do not want to follow i",

Not knowing what was going on, i opened my eyes. There was a big Cobra crawling on me. The snake the got off the bed and i calmed down, but then, i skinny pale hand appeared on my bed, then a tall creepy looking woman crawled on my bed.\n\n   The lady stood on top of me while there was a black liquid coming out of her mouth, dripping on my face. At that point, i don't know what happened but my body was thrown all the way to the other side of the room and have hit my back inmy brother's bed. I continued seeing the creepy lady on my bed. My mom came in the room and tried to calm me down as i was crying and screaming, pointing at the monster that was still in my bed, my mother not being able to see anything. \n\n   It was not a dream since i have asked my mom, but she just said that in that night i fainted and she put me back in bed. From that day, i refused to sleep in my brothers room again. The problem is, that even after i've changed rooms, that creature keeps appearing in my nightmares, most of the times trying to kill me, other times, just staring at me.\n\n   Also, some months ago, i found a video on TikTok showing pictures of people drawings of their sleep paralysis, and one of them looked EXACTLY like my sleep paralysis. I know that because i also have a drawing of that lady from way longer before i saw thst video. It might be a coincidence but for me it just seems to much.",

        "text": "We’ve all heard that children and animals can see things that we can’t. They’re more sensitive to the “paranormal/supernatural” side of things. I didn’t really believe this at first. Until my own kids were born. They’ve all had their own experiences but this one is about my youngest daughter. I will call her Bella. \n\nMy father in law was one of those people who begged for grandchildren. Every family get together it was always, “when are you all going to give me grandbabies?” Well it happened and he was a phenomenal grandfather. He was never too tired to play, no mess was too big, and he never said “no.” \n\nBut life happened and sadly he passed from a heart attack. My girls were 2 years old &amp; Bella was just 8 months old. It shattered us. Even me because he’d been in my life since I was 14. He was a 2nd dad to me. It hit my 2 year old pretty hard but Bella, I thought was too young to understand obviously.\n\nFast forward to Bella being a little over a year old. Every time I’d hold her she’d look off into corners, walls where nothing was, and smile, wave, etc. I just thought she was being a baby doing weird things. But then she learned to talk. This is where it gets eerie. I’d hear her talking to herself when her sister would be nowhere around. \n\nI listened 1 day and heard, “I know you miss Rowdy papaw. But nana is taking care of him.” (Rowdy was his pet shitzu) I walked in to ask her who she was talking to. She replied, “papaw Troy. He misses rowdy. Oh and he said tell nana happy an-ver-sorry.” I knew she was trying to say “anniversary” because their anniversary was the next day. My mouth dropped. She didn’t know that. She was too little. \n\nOver the years Bella would talk about him working in the coal mines, the machines he worked on, his friends and their families. Things she was NOT told about. Then another big incident where we all were freaked out. He wore a set of dog tags that he never took off. When my mother in law boxed up all his stuff, she misplaced them. She was so distraught over it.\n\nShe babysat my girls 1 day and called me crying. “Bella found his tags.” I was confused. She explained that she was walking my girls around outside and her wedding rings on her finger started to feel like it was burning or tingling. She ignored this but Bella said, “Papaw is trying to tell you his tags fell into the vent in your bedroom.” \n\nThere were even times when she was “talking” to him when you could smell his cologne or almost hear him.\n\nShe went inside to look and there they were. Bella is 6 now and barley remembers these things. But I think it’s obvious that she could see her papaw.",

But I promise that these events are true and my genuine experience.\n\nThis happened about 2 years ago, I feel now like I have to talk about it maybe from trauma of what I experienced or something. It was just so much.\n\nThis experience truly begins after my mom had passed. I was truly depressed, I had been depressed before but this was rock bottom depression. Like do or die type depression, it was rough.\n\nI realized something wasn’t quite right with me though. Everyone else was recovering from there grief and I wasn’t, if anything I was getting worse.\n\nSo I did what any normal person would do, I googled it.\n\nI surprisingly ended up on a page about spirits and how if they attach to you then they will bring your mood down. I was intrigued, I actually found a prayer to cast anything off of me. I’ll admit, I was skeptical but I decided why not it couldn’t do any harm.\n\nSo I said the prayer, and I felt an entire truckload of suffocating weight lift from my shoulders. Instantly, I didn’t feel depressed anymore. I thought that was the end of that.\n\nI was so very wrong.\n\nIt started off with me seeing something dark bolt by in the corner of my vision. Then a silhouette of a shadow man on my door, and by my bedside, at night.\n\nI was too old to be afraid of the dark, I told myself. Naive.\n\nIt came to a peak when I woke up from a bad dream one night and saw this THING creeping up the walls towards my ceiling from in front of the windows filling me with an intense feeling of dread.\n\nI immediately turned on my tv. LIGHT! I was safe, right?\n\nWrong, again.\n\nNext thing I know, I was energetically knocked out. All I could see was white, I had a kind of vision or dream. \n\nIt reminded me of my moms death, which was ruled as a suicide. This vision made me rethink it, maybe my family was right to believe it was murder.\n\nWhen I came to, I realized this THING was choking me, like full on had slight marks around my neck in the morning choking me.\n\nThen it disappeared.\n\nIn the morning, I did the only logical thing I could do. I packed my bags and stayed at a friends house for a week.\n\nThat was the best decision I’ve ever made. I got into healing crystal bracelets and how to use them for protection. Energetically I felt refreshed. \n\nSo I returned home.\n\nThe first thing I saw upon entering my room was a white and black orb fighting each other.\n\nThe bracelets were a game changer though, it seems like the shadow man couldn’t get me as long as I wore them. I also adopted the habit of sleeping with a Bible.\n\nI started regularly saying prayers to cleanse my room, and self. But everytime I kicked it out it would come back a few months later really angry.\n\nI have to say I slipped up a few times, didn’t wear my bracelets, and got attacked.\n\nI woke up from nightmares and had scratches on my back. It followed me to a friends house and attacked me right in front of them.\n\nBut it all ended one specific night. It had returned and I saw it again in full this time. A black shadow figure with bright glowing yellow eyes.\n\nIt tried to attack me as I laid with my bracelets on and Bible against my chest. When it did I had a vision of pages from the Bible flipping in my mind.\n\nThen it was over for good.\n\nI actually could recall some verses after and googled them. They were accurate.\n\nI left some details out, I just didn’t know how to add them. This was an entire year long experience.\n\nI saw the ghost of my mom about a month after she died, or I have wondered if IT was playing a trick on me.\n\nShe was dressed in very old timey clothes, but the spirit was black with grey mist around her.\n\nI was also experiencing a lot of telepathy, most likely from having that thing attached to me. I once heard it say that it will kill me.\n\nIt also wasn’t rare to hear something knock on my dresser 3 times before and after this experience. \n\nI had an experience with a… um, incubus after this… I don’t like talking about it honestly.\n\nI’ll be honest, I probably need therapy just from this experience.  I can’t exactly do that though considering the nature of this experience.\n\nI need help coming to terms with what happened here. What I was dealing with…\n\nFinal note, I know I’m not crazy. I had the marks on me to prove it was real. Also I have not really had any more experiences like this since I moved out of THAT house.",

When I got out of my vehicle, I pulled out my keyring from my coat pocket, but the key for my apartment wasn't on it. I reached back in my pocket, and it was there, but how could it have come out? It's hard to take keys out and put keys in it. It tears my fingernails when I try to hold it open enough to get the key started, and it hurts. It was in my coat pocket, which I set to the side, and only put it on when I left. This is the first time anything like this has happened. Has anyone else experienced this? It seems mundane, but I can't think of any plausible explanation.",
