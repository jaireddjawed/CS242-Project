But tonight was so disappointing. To start, the first act (Moor Mother) was horrible. Then, GY!BE was so loud. Even with earplugs it hurt. Usually on album or in concert their music is full of subtleties but tonight I could hardly recognize the songs because it was almost just loud noise. After 60 minutes I had enough and i left. \n\nHas anyone ever experienced such a situation at a GY!BE concert?",

I grew up on pop music, grunge, rock and roll but mainly listen to indie. \n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar won his Pulitzer a few years ago I decided to check him out and was really impressed with his stuff. I also very much enjoyed Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers. \n\nI really like story tellers, especially when it hits close to home. Can you suggest some artists/albums/songs that I may have missed in hip hop no older than 2000?  What‚Äôs something I maybe haven‚Äôt heard yet?\n\nI‚Äôm really looking for stuff that doesn‚Äôt objectify women,  not about how much sex they‚Äôre getting, or how much money they‚Äôve got (as the main theme of the song). \n\nI‚Äôm looking for a lyrical genius.
