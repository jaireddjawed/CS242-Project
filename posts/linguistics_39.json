I was interested in the spelling bee and wanted to know if I could start training (just for fun). Then I realized that I actually enjoyed learning about words and their history and meaning. The competition part of the bee, although fun, was only secondary to the actual learning.\n\nMy question is: Is there a well-known, highly-regarded source book or website that teaches or discusses this kind of thing? I know I can look at a dictionary, but it's missing the stories and histories about the words that makes this so interesting. The stories don't have to be long. A snippet for each word would do just to get me to look further on my own.\n\nNot sure if anything like that exist. Please let me know. TIA.",

I'd love to do some further research into this area of 'Lavender Linguistics,' and - while I understand that it can be difficult to determine whether the linguistic features used in conversation are directly related to the sexualities of the speakers or not - I would be particularly interested in examining how gay men may/may not speak less 'gay' in certain contexts e.g in a work environment with heterosexual colleagues vs in private with homosexual friends. \n\nHowever, I'm having a bit of difficulty finding linguistic studies that list the salient linguistic features of 'gay speech' in the same way that many studies explore, for example, features of men and women's language (e.g their use of interruptions, 'empty' adjectives, and so on). While I can find plenty of material on the key phonological features of gay male speech, it would be extremely helpful if someone could point me in the direction of studies that describe the main lexical, grammatical, morphosyntactic, etc. features of the English used by modern gay men (if any such studies even exist). I'm aware that Lakoff claimed that many gay men use an increased amount of superlatives, but beyond that I'm slightly stuck. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

I am wondering if people have made any formal observations of the name-choosing patterns of these families. What name(s) would be used around the house to directly address the child, to refer to that child, to be used publicly, or to be used legally? As a specific example, there are a lot of Korean-Chinese mixes in both Korea and China. I once watched a [video of one girl of mixed Korean and Chinese descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4MkcNTrEts). She speaks Korean (Dad's language), Mandarin (Mom's language), and English. She is also triliterate. When she speaks Mandarin, she says her Hanja name with Mandarin pronunciation, probably because the interviewer of the video questions her in Mandarin, and so she responds in Mandarin. I wonder if these families [follow the traditional Korean naming pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBFqPects_Q) with a Sino-Korean name, in which the given name is based on Hanja characters for meaning, or a pure Korean name (without regard to how good it sounds in Chinese transliteration) and a pure Chinese name (without regard to how good it sounds in Korean).

        "text": "First, I make this clear: I am not a parent. I ask this question, simply because I have read a ton of articles on bilingual parenting, and I find this topic very interesting. My own upbringing is closer to the minority-language-at-home approach because of my immigrant parents who only spoke their native language to me at home. However, I don't think it was a conscious decision for them. At the time, my father knew enough written English to work in academia, and my mother barely knew any English. What choice did they have? The Mandarin I grew up with was region-accented Putonghua. It was not really standard Mandarin, and it was not really a regional topolect. It was somewhere in the middle - Putonghua pronunciation and tones with regional vocabulary. \n\nI am also aware of the one-parent, one language approach. But I don't know how exactly this is supposed to work. Basically, one language is assigned to one parent, and the parent must stick to this language as much as possible. The other parent sticks to another language. And the child will become bilingual and not get confused. However, what if the two parents want to talk to each other in the car? \"Hey, should we go left or right?\" \"Left.\" If one parent answers the other parent, then the children will know that the parent understands the other parent's language. What motivation is there to get the children to continue speaking the minority language if the minority-language-speaking parent understands the majority language? It's one thing to learn two languages at birth, but it's another to *keep* those two languages at high fluency in adulthood, allowing the person to pass as a highly literate native speaker in one and a near-native, highly literate speaker in another. Have people ever discussed how to deal with these kinds of situations, especially when kids refuse to speak the minority language or lose proficiency in the minority language? ",

I'm not speaking of the subjunctive mood here, but rather what sounds to my American ears as a more straightforward or even random substitution of one verb form for the other--e.g. \"she was pissed!\" instead becomes \"she *were* pissed!\" This seems to appear in both third-person and first-person constructions. The feature seems often (but not exclusively) used by working class characters (in fiction), which leads me to believe it may be used as either a sort of class marker or a formal/informal register marker in general. But as an ignorant American, I could be misreading it completely; as far as I know, we don't have that particular feature in any US English dialect. Googling inevitably just leads to unhelpful info on the subjunctive mood. Does anyone have any info on this feature? Does it have a formal name? What dialects does it appear in? In what linguistic circumstances is it used? Thanks!",

In flat, unremarkable areas with no clear center, they might as well be synonymous. In any other case, the language used is still dependent on the topography of the land in question and how urban the area is. \n\nTL;DR: it's just another way to give directions while referencing your surroundings. \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/8vn6le/why_you_should_go_to_nasslli_the_next_time_it/",
        "text": "I wanted to create this thread to encourage people who might be in a similar position as myself to attend NASSLLI and events like it. NASSLLI is the North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information. [Here is the website](https://www.cmu.edu/nasslli2018/) for this year’s event. [Here are some photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/uzoidUq) I took of where it was held, at Carnegie Mellon University. \n\nMy personal background: I’m a high school dropout who began studying linguistics as a tween and just never stopped. I started my adult life working in a recording studio (long story), and then transitioned into healthcare (funny story.) Now that I have a Big Kid Job and the financial means, I’m putting myself through undergrad at the cheapest local university in my state, studying linguistics and communication disorders. I intend to pursue linguistics into academia, but I’m kind of on the long haul budget plan. My logic professor recommended that I check out NASSLLI and try to attend if I could afford it. \n\nI am so glad I did. \n\n*ON GETTING THROUGH THE FIRST FEW DAYS:*\n\nNASSLLI does this bootcamp thing where you can take an intensive course the weekend before the main event. There were a few options I was really interested in this year, but I ultimately went with a class on topology, logic, and epistemology. On the first day, I rolled into class with my philosophy friend and we tried being our usual goofy selves only to find a room of quiet, nervous, and maybe slightly standoffish folks. Shortly after, we did the usual “go around the room, tell everybody who you are and where you’re coming from.” By the time it got to my philosophy friend and myself we were grinning in disbelief because it seemed like every person in the room had a far more prestigious standing than us - Harvard, Stanford, Brown, these people were coming from, and here we are, two idiots from a no-name university, right? \n\nWell, the good news is that our status as no-name folks helped weed out the people with sticks up their butts very quickly. It also attracted the good kind of people. In bootcamp class we met a guy who is also a second chance student studying math who we would grow close to over the week. \n\nAt any rate, bootcamp class was great for kicking our heads in gear for the week ahead! It helped that the lecturer was a superb teacher who eased us into connections between topology and epistemic logic that would be expounded upon throughout the week in other lectures. I highly recommend taking the option to get the old gears moving if you do attend NASSLLI in the future. \n\n*ON BEING AN INTROVERT, OR HAVING ANXIETY ABOUT THESE KINDS OF GATHERINGS:*\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, I went to NASSLLI with a friend, someone I met in a logic class at my no name terrible horrible state university. I’m the introvert and painfully shy, he’s the extrovert with a panic disorder. Several times, he had to leave the room during panic attacks and text me through them so that he could recover enough to return. At the end of the day, I had a bad habit of revisiting every interaction I had with other people and worrying if I came off as stupid, too silly, arrogant, etc - and he walked me through those. While it was really nice to have each other in person going through the same thing, I think anybody who struggles with social anxiety or panic could absolutely survive the whole thing with a decent support system via phone/texting. You’re honestly so busy thinking and talking and thinking some more during the day about the things right in front of you that the feelings of anxiety and imposter syndrome swell and retreat in brief pockets of time relative to the whole event. \n\nPersonally, I have mod extraordinaire /u/MalignantMouse to thank for quelling a lot of my anxiety too. When I commented in a small questions thread here asking if anyone was going, they excitedly talked up the event to me. I didn’t know what to wear, or how to approach the whole thing, and they were so helpful in getting me hyped for the event. They also recommended the BEST food and drink in the area, so we ate like queens while we were there. A hundred thousand thank you’s, MalignantMouse!\n\n*ON BEING A LINGUIST AMONG MATHEMATICIANS, COMPSCI FOLK, ETC:*\n\nAttending NASSLLI is probably the best thing I’ve done for my brain in a long time. The most rewarding things I got out of it came from discussions I had with people whose focus is in completely different areas - you’d be surprised how many of them are interested in language, or at least your perspective as a “language person.” I’m not going to tell you that every attempt to nerd out is going to go well - we experienced a touch of rude dismissal here and there - but the stimulating chats are absolutely worth taking the chance. I actually ended up eating ice cream with an epistemic logic lecturer one evening, and the next day getting lunch with a proof theory lecturer, for example - people who had no obligation to talk to some silly undergrad but were genuinely interested in my thoughts on how language intersects with other fields of study. \n\nI also found some PhD students that I could volley back and forth about philosophy and pragmatics and stuff, and we globbed together a lot of the time as people with similar interests do. :)\n\n*MY SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE:*\n\n[Here are some photos from within NASSLI stuff.](https://imgur.com/a/ffWG87K)\n\nI took the following courses:\n\n*Bootcamp: Topology, Logic, and Epistemology, presented by Adam Bjorndahl.*\n\nI talked about this above a bit! \n\n*Introduction to Pragmatics, presented by Bart Geurts*\n\nBasically Gricean pragmatics, Bart Geurts style. This class lead to some fun arguments with people about common ground and such. \n\n*From Epistemic Logic to Social Cognition, presented by Rineke Verbrugge*\n\nThis is where the Friends episode in epistemic logic photo originated! It was a very playful environment, full of games and riddles, connecting epistemic logic and theory of mind type stuff. I decided over our ice cream chat that I’m adopting Dr. Verbrugge as my auntie. \n\n*Topological Epistemology of Science, presented by Kevin Kelly and Konstantin Genin*\n\nThis is where my favorite quotes came from! Kevin Kelly is a delightfully humorous teacher who draws heavily on the history of philosophy of science to tie his work together. Genin made some fun analogies between topology and statistics with regard to verification towards the end, too. \n\n*Logic in Natural Language, Logic for Natural Language, presented by Larry Moss.*\n\nAhhh, pretty much my zen zone. Larry Moss guided his lecture from the foundations of logic into his combinatory categorial grammar. Sublime. \n\n*Proof Theory: Logical and Philosophical Aspects, presented by Shawn Standefer.*\n\nI wish this class weren’t at the end of the day, because my brain was so exhausted I felt like I didn’t get as much out of it as I could. This course was another example of very interesting interdisciplinary approach to logic and math with a philosophy lens. \n\n*IN THE END:*\n\nI’d be happy to talk to anybody who’s curious or nervous about NASSLLI. This post is already ridiculously long, but I’m happy to talk specifics in the comments or private message. It was really the best intellectual experience I’ve had in a long time, and would highly recommend it to anyone. \n\n[Bonus pictures of UPitt’s Cathedral of Learning that we visited on a lunch break one day.](https://imgur.com/gallery/pahz5pd) ",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.
