        "text": "Hi, I've noticed that olive oil is somehow seen as this luxury or uber-special oil in cooking, it's used in every dish almost, despite having some disadvantages (for example, low smoke point, strong taste, etc).\n\nI'm curious about why that came to be, so I've decided to study it and make a survey on it. I would really appreciate it if you could answer it, I will share the results here afterwards.\n\nI'd also like your opinions in the comment!\n\nThank you to anyone who answers!

I'm wondering specifically what they mean by this because I've always found produce to be generally cheap? Obviously buy fruits and vegetables that are organic or from stores like Whole Foods or Erewhon will be more expensive but as many of us know, organic does not mean healthier. Normal grocery stores like Kroger, Trader Joes, Walmart, etc seem to have reasonably priced produce. Like today I bought a few bulk carrots for $0.75, bananas are $0.19 each at Trader Joe's....which to me seems pretty cheap. I mean I don't know how much cheaper these foods can get. \n\nAnyway, wondering if someone can explain this further...the theory that fruits and vegetables are expensive. Thanks!",

Does this mean, if I bought 100 lb, it would contain 17 lb of protein?  If that's not what it means, then what does 17% mean in this example?\n\nA more specific example, I am trying to throw together an insect chow recipe, and the common wisdom is 20-25% protein for this insect.  I don't know what that means... because, when I look at various potential ingredients, they always list protein in grams, not a %... which would also be off, because I'm sure the insect's %DV of nutrients is not the same as a human's.\n\nSo... if I want to whip up a mash of sorts, and have 25% protein, does that mean 25% of the weight of the mash is protein?\n\nThanks!",

My idea is to just eat fruit oatmeal, drink a lot of water, and eat grilled chicken or baked fish for meat. I considered investing in huel or soylents along with granola bars for to-go meals, but I felt like there may be better perspectives for another approach. Side note: I am also interested in developing a new physical hobby like a martial art, dancing, or swimming so any tips for a relevant diet to that lifestyle is also appreciated.",
