        "text": " My (27M) and my friend (26F) have been best friends since college - about 8 years. She was essentially my \"Best Man\" at my wedding two years ago. Over the course of our long relationship things have sometimes been contentious but have never blown up. She moved away with her partner so I don't see her as often as I used to but I cherish the times we still get to see each other.\n\nAbout a year ago, our conversations became marked by a sort of awkwardness - it felt like we weren't \"Flowing\" the way we used to. When together in group settings she seemed to be avoidant, and not really interested in engaging w me beyond just a simple hello. To break through this tension, I kept reaching out &amp; seeing if she wanted to hang out one-on-one &amp; she kept responding that she was busy &amp; ultimately didn't seem interested in it. She also started arranging hang outs with the larger group without me - after it happened several times I felt like something was up. I asked a mutual friend if there was an issue but she told me that she wasn't aware of one. This passive-aggression went on for months.\n\nOn New Years things escalated. She asked for help with handling a mutual friend of ours who was drunk. When he became a bit more than I could handle, I asked if she could help &amp; she basically said \"just handle it\" in a curt manner. I said that she was putting me in a bad position and then she responded by repeating \"Just handle it\". Later, I calmly confronted her &amp; asked her why she did that when I told her it made me uncomfortable, and she literally waved her hand in my face and walked away without responding. Needless to say, I wasn't happy.\n\nThe next day, I asked her what the problem was. She said she felt that our relationship was no longer healthy for her and that she didn't leave our interactions feeling good anymore. She said that she felt I could be unaware conversationally (talking over people, interrupting), and that she felt she couldn't bring it up because she felt I wouldn't take it well.\n\nI know that this is a problem for me - I can get overly-excited when talking about a topic I enjoy and lose awareness of the larger conversation - its a general bad habit I have, not a personal affront to her. I still apologized for it &amp; said that I never meant to offend her but that I understand its a bad habit of mine that clearly upsets her and I can work on being more mindful of it.\n\nAfter this she seemed really happy &amp; wanted to keep talking. However, I still find myself really angry at the prolonged passive-aggression, her open hostility on New Years Eve, and the fact that she was willing to end a 8 year friendship without even talking to me. Do I have a right to feel this way?",

Of course she got her way in the end and even told me off about my behaviour. \n\nShe got really angry when i did not want to wait for her to buy her drink (that is getting restocked later) at the store when we were rushing for time. Check out my profile for the full story posted on AITA.\n\nWhenever i initiate meetups it is always with conditions like finding a restaurant to accommodate her no carbs diet, finding a restaurant that is pet friendly and near her house (she always has to bring her dog whenever i meet her), only meeting on weekdays. No problem on that. \n\nApparently during these meetups, she was unhappy/offended with some things i say? i didn't even know what things as we always ended off on a good note. she told me i am giving off negative vibes and she don't want to be around me so she has been avoiding me. On hindsight, i am the one initiating meetups (silly me). i don't know what to make of it? i will have to think through everything i say to her for fear of offending her (if i ever talk to her again)? im so depressed after this as she called me negative,  and verbally abuse? when the whole thing started after i suggested for us to go... she didn't even ask me if i'm ok to wait for her.\n\nhelp... i will definitely try to not offend her again but it's hard finding the correct thing to say.",

There was about 20 people in total. \n\nI arrived to the restaurant where two of them were already waiting for a table, I shook their hand and introduced myself. Another two came and I did the same, so did my colleague. \n\nThen suddenly the remainder of the group arrived all at the same time, about 16 people. We didn’t have a seat yet so are all standing in a small reception area waiting. My colleague started walking in a line shaking everyone’s hand and introducing himself. Something about this seemed socially awkward - perhaps because it was such a casual setting and he kept saying the same thing over and over again and sticking his hand out for a handshake.\n\nI didn’t do this, I just smiled at the group and introduced myself to the people standing beside me. When I got to the table I struck up conversation and naturally introduced myself that way. There were a few people I didn’t get to introduce myself to.\n\nI didn’t think about it until my colleague brought it up and said it was rude I didn’t shake everyone’s hand when they arrived. Now I feel like I’ve made a bad impression, but honestly I think after a certain number of people it just becomes awkward to give an individual handshake, especially at a chill dinner.\n\nSo, what do you think? Was I accidentally rude?\n\nTLDR: didn’t shake everyone’s hand at a casual dinner, colleague says I was rude.",

        "text": "I work with a good team of people. But there's this one dude who's extremely awkward (many people have been discussing it). \n\nThis isn't a criticism of him by the way, as he's a really nice guy. But he's just really, really awkward. And he makes everything awkward and can often make people uncomfortable. At worst, I find myself in cringe-worthy situations around other people that I just makes me want to crawl under a rock from humiliation.... \n\nI suppose if he just owned it the reality is people would probably be more accepting of it. But he tries to mask it and pretend like there's nothing going on (and it seems to just make people talk about it more). \n\nBut he keeps going on about how lonely &amp; desperate he is (and I think all the women at work can tell). Meanwhile, there are women he's interested in he who he's noticed give me a lot of attention (but seemingly ignore him). And he keeps going on about it and saying things like, *''What do you have that I don't?... I'm handsome too (at least my mom tells me so). We're pretty similar. Same style, same look, same vibe, we're basically the same guy.''*\n\nI don't know how he expects me to take this, but it's just so odd to listen to because he's Samoan and my parents are from Russia. And we have next to nothing in common. And have entirely different personalities. \n\nI've tried discussing it privately with management and they all get really funny whenever his name is brought up (almost like protective). So I'm currently of the impression that he maybe has some kind of disability that isn't publicly disclosed. \n\nBut not knowing, I have no idea how to deal with him. Any suggestions or advice?...",

Firstly, we've only been talking for a few weeks/a month, and even though we've shared plenty of personal conversations, I wouldn't want them to be uncomfortable meeting someone that is still technically a bit of a stranger, even though they were the one that considered me a friend first. Secondly, if they told me no, or gave an otherwise \"no\" response, I fear the conversation will die due to it. Thirdly, I am afraid they will see me as creepy for asking to hang out. This one isn't the most rational worry, but I do fear it a lot.\n\nIf I were to ask them, I would say the following: \"you should totally come to \\[my town\\] if you ever have the chance, because of \\[reason/thing\\]\"\n\nShould I take a chance and ask them to hang out, or let it be for now?",

        "text": "So like the title says, I’ve been having some trouble with engaging in conversation with my friends and their other friends. Just last week I was meeting with a friend(let’s call her G) I hadn’t seen in about a month and we were gonna hang out at an event my university was having. To my knowledge it was gonna be me, G, our other friend(let’s call her S) and G’s roommate. For context, me, G and S are in the same friend group and have been friends since we were 15. We are 19 now. We aren’t super close but I wanted to become closer to them. G and S are also besties and have been since 6th grade. Back to the story. I was fine with that because although I didn’t know the roommate I knew both G and S since we’re in the same friend group and it wouldn’t be so awkward. \n\nFast forward to the event, we all met and it was ok but I was having trouble participating in the conversations they were having because they kept speaking about things I didn’t know about. While we were waiting in line for an event to start(for about 10 min), I didn’t say one word because I couldn’t figure out how to insert myself. I felt super awkward and embarrassed because they just kept talking and I felt really left out. We ended up going to get something to eat and all of a sudden more of G and S’s friends show up to join us. I’m talking like 4-5 more people appeared. At this point I was feeling very annoyed and uncomfortable because to my knowledge it was supposed to be just us 4. \n\nI didn’t have a problem with the friends that showed up because we all went to the same high school together but I just wasn’t friends with them. We sat down for dinner and everyone was talking to each other and I was the only silent one. I didn’t know what to say and I was so embarrassed that I wanted to cry. I ended up making up a stupid excuse that I had work soon so I could leave. I’m very socially awkward/anxious so it’s hard for me to genuinely make connections with other people. Literally all the friends I have now are friends I made in middle/high school. I was much more confident and carefree back then. I was really looking forward to catching up with my friends and this really discouraged me. \n\nTo make matters worse I felt really jealous about the fact that G’s roommate is closer to my friends than I am. She’s even closer to G and S’s friends and I’m not even though I’ve known them much longer. I’m not sure how I could’ve done a better job in that situation. It’s like my mind went blank and no one said anything to me. What could I have said to join in on the convo? I would have loved to be friends with G and S’s friends because they are genuinely cool people but we just don’t hang out unless G and S are around. I hate feeling like the odd one out.",

        "text": "I (22F) am a senior in college and until a few months ago, I was a part of a larger friend group (around 6-8 people) who were people that I either know from class or met through work. Around October-November of last year, a few of them kinda stopped responding to my texts and stopped inviting me places or to hang out. I would see them on social media or in the dining hall, but they clearly had a more established internal friend group that I wasn’t a part of. When I have gotten dinner with them, they rarely talk to me or they will talk over me. There are a few people in the friend group that still talk to me/text me, but the group as a whole doesn’t really invite me anywhere or include me in group activities. My first thought was that I had done/said something wrong, but I don’t know what and they won’t tell me (I am also scared to ask so it’s definitely not all their fault). This has been going on for a few months now but it felt very sudden and I have been driving myself crazy trying to figure out why.\n\nI am currently in therapy and have spoken about this with my therapist, who has basically told me that I should steer towards my other friends that aren’t in this friend group. I’ve been trying to do that, but since I am still friends with 1-2 people from that friend group (let’s call them A and B), I will see the group hang out without me (around campus and on social media) and it always makes everything feel worse. I don’t want to ask A and B to drop the other people in the group since they have both expressed to me that they do not want to be middlemen in this situation, which I want to be respectful of. However, I also want to be included with my old friend group and want to have someone else in my metaphorical corner.\n\nInitially, I thought it was because a lot of the group are in similar classes/majors in college so they are more likely to see each other and make spontaneous plans in person. I have tried to text them and make plans, but they rarely respond. I asked if I could come and hang out, but they brushed it off/dodged the question and I have seen them hanging out together without inviting me. B in particular has responded with “I have plans already” and then I would see them in the dining hall and the plans in question are plans with the rest of the friend group. B has since told me that this was to avoid hurting my feelings. Theoretically, since I used to be friends with everyone in the group, there should be no issue with also inviting me to come as well, but I only hang out with A and B separately from the rest of the group. Both A and B have acknowledged that I am being treated differently, but they don’t want to get involved and I don’t want to make them. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I’m trying to stop asking to be involved with the people who have been ignoring me and focus on other friends who haven’t been treating me badly, but it hurts to see the group walking together or hanging out and having a good time when they barely talk to me anymore. I’m very introverted and I don’t do well with confrontation, so I’ve put off asking most of them about it directly.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I want to brush it off and hang out with other people, but a lot of people in this group were people that I would’ve considered to be my best/closest friends and those types of relationships are hard to develop, especially since I’m a senior. How do I deal with the sadness and anger of loosing a whole friend group?",

I struggle to understand basic social skills so this place has been a godsend for me.\n\nAnyway I ask this because of a specific situation with someone at work but I’ve noticed it with other people too.\n\nBasically one girl at my job always looks into my eyes when we’re in a group and she laughs. Like the other day me and this guy were talking to her and we were both on one side and she was facing us. She’s the type to hold eye contact with whoever she’s talking to but he made her laugh and her eyes immediately darted to me where she looked into my eyes for a few seconds then back to him cos he was still talking. I’m not the most confident guy and have never been good with eye contact so this makes me feel a bit weird.\n\nIs this a bad thing, because it feels weird that every time she’s laughing when I’m there she looks at me, or am I just being paranoid here and overthinking. \n\nSorry if this sounds stupid but I just wanna know if this actually means anything or if it’s just nothing.

I glanced around and see her watching me, her head was turning me as i was moving closer and she was leant against the door like she was waiting to get out. I happened to park close to her, and I looked away and kinda glanced back to see if she was still looking and she was, so I kept looking straight ahead. Right when I get closer to her car before I could pass her she gets out and starts messing around with something in her trunk.\n\nShe never made eye contact with me while she was out of her car though. Before that when i was at a 4 way stop in the parking lot, she was on another side, and I was kinda zoned out but kinda looked at her too see if she was going to go first. When she looked back she gasped and started digging around in her bag up front and took off kinda fast.\n\nToday, I'm still in my parking space and she turns and glances at me while she passes me and a bit afterwards when I pick up my friend I drove past her and accidentally looked in her direction and she was already staring and didn't looked away, I turned my head forward after that.\n\nI wouldn't mind saying hi to her but I don't if this is how a girl would act if shes uncomfortable or if shes just shy. Is this avoiding behavior? I am interested in her.",

The people in my flat are also in each other's rooms constantly but since I moved in late I'm not close enough with them to just knock and walk in. One of them just told me to leave the other day so they could have time together. He apologised the next day but I do feel they don't really want me there.\n\nI don't know how but the way they talk is just different. There were times when we were going out, on the bus or watching netflix and they just seem to pull these funny things to say out of nowhere. It's like they speak a different language. I don't have as much of this problem being with my actual friends, and in the one group I'm in I'd say I'm relatively outgoing. But even then I say more 'obvious' things instead of the sort of thing those guys seem to be able to conjure up. \n\nAny ideas what I should do, and what kind of things do those guys say?

It’s more like my way of inciting a chill conversation. In my mind, I would expect my friend to respond like, “Yeah man. This traffic is pretty bad.” And then we move onto wherever the conversation leads.\n\nLately though, I’ve been meeting people who don’t seem to understand my way of speaking. When I ask questions like that, they give quite a literal answer such as, “Well it’s 4:30 and we’re in the X part of town. Or there might be an accident down on highway Y….” You get the idea. Sometimes it aggravates people, especially older men and they mistake my questions for ignorance.\n\nAll of this irritates me because I’m not actually seeking a literal answer. I’ve always seen it as being chill and having a laid back conversation. When certain people respond this way to me, it makes me feel like they’re just waiting for chances to stroke their ego, and it makes me feel like I’m just talking to a wall. It also gives people the wrong impression and they think I’m an idiot.\n\nDo I have weird social skills that I need to change, or are these people just being uptight? Is this just a matter of adapting to different social settings? I’m genuinely curious to know if anyone else feels this way…",

        "text": "I guess I’ll just ramble here. I have Asperger’s and have posted here several times looking for advice to the crisis that is my social life. Never to any avail though. People have given me advice and tried to help but it just feels like I’m a lost cause.\n\nI have exactly one friend who I talk to on a regular basis and who I hang out with, although being at college now I don’t hang out with him. I have other “friends” I talk to, mostly in classes, and other people I used to be close friends with who I text every now and then.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, my only in-person real socialization is with people in my classes. I’m not bad at talking with other people, at least not when we have a full on conversation and I’m somewhat comfortable with them. For example, in my lab group in class there’s a girl and two guys and I make them laugh, smile, and I love talking with them and listening to them. But that only lasts for an hour and a half twice a week, and that’s the most socialization I do in a week. I enjoy it, and I look forward to it, but I can’t figure out how to do that outside of class. It’s like a world of difference.\n\nSome days I become so lonely and crave socialization so much that I’ll go to the grocery store, I’ll go to the gym (sometimes even twice a day), and heck even taking a shower sometimes makes me feel better in this regard. But afterwards it really doesn’t make much of a difference. Even going to the dining hall, where I always sit by myself. But it’s all only temporary relief.\n\nI’ve decided to start improving myself, too, which makes me feel better about myself and makes me happier. For example, I’ve started working out, taking care of my acne, doing more for my oral hygiene, et cetera. And it has put me in a better place mentally and physically, certainly. But it still doesn’t solve my social life, or lack there of.\n\nI’ve posted in the Asperger’s subreddit to see how others deal with this, but that only ever disappoints and saddens me. They all seem to believe that there is no solution and with Asperger’s we’re cursed for a life of isolation and loneliness. I don’t want to believe that. I want to believe that I can find at least one person at the very least to share my life with.\n\nAnd I know it’s possible, and that’s partially why I’ve started working to improve myself. I want to become a person who can be happy alone so that I can bring happiness to other people and make and strengthen relationships. I’m not a bad person, I’m not an ugly person, and I’m not an unhealthy person, but I have to admit that I am lonely no matter how hard I try to be able to be happy alone.\n\nBut I don’t know how. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to improve this facet of my life. I can improve everything else but no matter what advice I’m given, I can’t seem to improve it. And while I can find motivation and discipline in myself to improve myself and be happy with myself, I want more than that, I want to share, love, and grow with other people but that is the impassible obstacle I’ve struggled with and likely always will.",

If I can’t even start a conversation with people in my university lectures, because I have terrible self-image and I’m self-conscious and fear rejection, then how can I expect to perform?  \n\nOn the rare occasion where I happen to talk to someone, I almost always feel really good and human despite being introverted. I clearly remember nearly all interactions I’ve had with people. In general, I crave that conversation, or even just a few words exchanged, with other people but I keep shying away and living in the shadows.  \n\nCurrently I feel like a rain cloud. People often feel miserable at their sight, and wish they’d disappear to bring back clear skies. But I don’t know how to stop appearing miserable because of my ugly and unapproachable appearance. Instead, I’d like to be that ray of light people see whenever I walk by.  \n\nSo I guess a lot of my problems stem from my view on my appearance and how I wish I didn’t look this way. It sucks because with my creative hobby, it does feel like a waste of time if I’m not sharing what I’ve been learning/creating with anyone. Sure I could post on the internet, but I prefer to show people in person even if I have bad social anxiety.",

Most people do not interest me at all. I can work a room for networking if needed but I struggle a lot with small talk mentally because most of what people have to say bore me. I know this is coming off badly but I’m being honest so I can get help or advice. \n\nI’m very observant so I know who likes me and who doesn’t by just observing body language or observing consistency in behaviour to see how I’d like to befriend. My intuition never fails me too. However, with people I like I can talk and laugh for hours. \n\nI find work to be challenging at times. I like to go in, do my work, have limited small talk and keep out of trouble. I think some of this is rooted in me being a PoC and understanding that the rules are sometimes different for us and I also am not interested in being the class clown. Maybe I take myself too seriously but I when I speak people listen, they take it seriously and it’s usually to add value or answers. But, I know this makes me come off as intense. However, when I loosen up or show them another side of me they cross boundaries. As a person, I don’t enjoy small talk that leads to gossip, excessive complaining (just focus on a solution) or mean spirited behaviour but this is the currency at work. I also can’t fake liking someone too. My body automatically freezes towards them and my walls go up. I’m also very by the book too. I don’t enforce it on anyone because I’m quite to myself but I do hold people to a standard mentally. \n\nI must be the problem because I’ve never felt like I fit in anywhere (professional or personally - but I do have a good network of friends but not a core group). I get on with colleagues fine but never in the core group or whatever but I’ll have 1-3 colleagues I really click with. I just can’t fake it lol. Even when they crack a joke I I’ll sometimes force laugh because its either not funny or I don’t get it. How can I work on my social skills and stop being so intense? Or do I just accept this is who I am? \n\nI suppose after awhile it’s not about being seen as reliable/respectable but likeable.\n\nYes - I’m in therapy 1-2x a week.",

        "text": "If you were like me, you struggled to connect, to go deeper in a relationship. Sure, you make acquaintances and are surrounded by wonderful people but it's difficult to go deeper. \n\nWhat I've discovered is that making friends is a bit like whipping out the old watering can to grow the seed of a relationship. But instead of water, you pour what I like to call “feel-good particles” (FGP). With enough FGP, the seed of a relationship will sprout and grow. \n\nThe total FGP a seed gets over its lifetime is called the lifetime feel-good value (LFG). \n\nA connection = **LFG** (Lifetime feel good value) \n\nYou could meet and talk with someone for 5 years and still not be close to them.\n\nYou could meet and talk with someone for 1 minute and become very close to them.\n\nThe difference lies in the LFG you have with these people.\n\n**The higher the LFG you have with someone, the more likely they’ll care about you and want to talk and hang out with you (if possible).** \n\nWhat should you do then to make close friends? Make someone feel good with your words like no other and the rest will fall into place. \n\nBe authentic, be honest, be awesomely you.",

Pretty extreme for something idek ive done. Am i being super rude without realising it or something? Any advice?",
