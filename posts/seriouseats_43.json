Anyway I had a few other things to order on amazon so I added the book just got it on thursday and already I love it.\n\nMade the asparagus with walnut vinaigrette, extra crispy sweet potatoes, and sous vide hangar steaks with the marsala mushroom pan sauce switched for a red wine mushroom pan sauce. (Kenji, don't you love when people change things in your recipes then tell you how terrible they were)\n\nEverything was amazing, but beyond the recipes I can't say enough about how informative and easy to read the book is (even if the sucker is heavy enough to club a seal). I even caught my girlfriend who only makes reservations flipping through it.\n\nI've heard for the past few years people raging about sous vide, but always chalked it up to some lazy trendy bullshit. How can meat be better sitting in tepid water than over some charcoal. It's an assualt on my maniless to not be out there in the rain cooking meat over fire.\n\nBut still, I am at the store and see a great deal on hangar steaks, I look up hangar steaks, and bam, sous vide hangar steaks with chimichurri (which i substituted for a pan sauce because who plans ahead to buy fresh oregano, really).\n\nI have a cooler in the garage, a candy thermometer that cost me five dollars, and a water heater turned up enough to scald satan himself, let's see how this works.\n\nThose hangar steaks were definitely top 10 of any steak I've ever eaten at a fraction of the cost, the tenderness of filet, the meaty flavor of a rib eye. And 7 bucks a fucking pound. I had barely finished eating before I started looking up immersion circulators on amazon.\n\nAnyway, I've just taken the first steps of what I'm sure is a long kinky journey, but I'm already completely happy with my purchase. If you don't own this book already you need to buy it. \n\nOh, and I would have never thought microwaving asparagus could be so good, so fast and so easy. I definitely used to be in the crowd that saw the microwave as a way to heat up water in your dorm room to make a cup o noodle.",

This is because many of his recipes involve letting the dough rise in the fridge for three to five days for the best gluten and flavor development. After that however, it needs to get to room temp for stretching and then baking. He then also mentioned in his ask me anything in /r/pizza to [\"make sure that the dough rests at room temp for long enough before you stretch it.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/595f2r/hey_rpizza_were_j_kenji_l%C3%B3pezalt_and_ed_levine_of/d97bgr2/) \n\nMy problem isn't waiting too short a period of time, it's that I want to wait longer. By the time I get home on a weeknight I don't have two hours to wait for the dough to rest at room temperature. Does anyone know if it's alright for me to leave the dough covered on my counter during the day while I'm at work? It would be there for probably about 10 hours or so. He does state \"at least two hours\" in step three of his New York-Style recipe, but I wanted to get confirmation before I tried anything. \n\nEdit: clarified that this two hour resting period would be *after* the dough has risen in the fridge for a few days.

Being that this is my first time using a pressure cooker (and I'd like it to go well), I was hoping I could get some advice on how to translate this recipe into an instant pot recipe.\n\nFor example, for step 1 should I be using the sauté function? For step 2 how long should I run the cooker for b/c in the comments they say that 40 minutes is much too long? And should I use the slow release even though Kenji says to use quick release + cold water? Etc etc etc. and any other advice you might have for this recipe/pressure cookers in general\n\nThanks and looking forward to hearing what y'all think. I'll be sure to update this post with pictures of my successful (hopefully) stew",

But whenever I use one, I have to spend a ton of time trying to clean it, brushing every square individually with a bottle brush and then still sometimes having to make a second pass, especially near where the feet are. I don't have a dishwasher, but I suspect I'd still have stuck food on there. \n\nAre there any decent alternatives or tricks to cleaning them? If its relevant, the rack I have is the ATK recommended CIA one. If someone made one with just horizontal bars (i.e. running parallel to the short side of a half sheet pan) sufficiently closely spaced and maybe clamped onto the sides of a half sheet pan to be kept in place, that would cut down a lot of the complexity of cleaning. But as far as I know, nobody does this (possibly for strength/cost reasons?)",

I seared the chilled breast on a skillet with oil and was really impressed with the overall taste and texture (as far as boneless skinless chicken breast goes). Does anyone else do this? I can't think of why there would be but are there any health reasons not to use this method?\n\n",

        "text": "I'm cooking the food for a party of 30-40 people and having a taco bar sounds to me like the best option for cooking a lot of food in advance where I don't have to do much during the party. Ground Beef and shredded chicken shouldn't be much of a problem but I was hoping to be able to adapt the [carnitas recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/no-waste-tacos-de-carnitas-with-salsa-verde-recipe.html) to Sous vide as I would likely be doing around 15 pounds (what you get from sam's club) where this recipe is for 3 pounds.\n\nMy plan would be to cube the pork as in the recipe and toss with some salt, granulated onion, granulated garlic, a bay leaf, and a small amount of cinnamon. Skipping the orange as the citrus would have an adverse affect on the texture of the meat. Cook the pieces at 165 for 24 hours as is recommended from the sous vide pulled pork recipe. \n\nI'd then put the pork in an ice bath and refrigerate until I was ready to start putting out food for the party. \n\nRemove the pork as needed and place into casserole dishes or cast iron skillets, shredding the chunks as needed. Take solid pieces of fat from the sous vide bag directly back with the pork. Put all the juices and jells into a saucepan to warm up to proceed with the salsa verde, skimming for fat once more and readding that to the pork. Maybe putting squeezing some orange juice back into the pork as well. Broil the pork as directed in the recipe. \n\nAny suggestions for how this might be improved?",

It really wasn't necessary to have such a nice box though.\n\n* They are bigger than what I expected with a bit of heft to them.  They're not too heavy and the heft seems as though it will be a really nice.\n\n* They fit my hand perfectly.  My hands are a bit larger than average with long fingers and I will be able to use these without cramping.\n\n* The edges are very sharp.  I cut a few things and really liked how the edge had a nice glide.  The edge was consistent.\n\n* The handle really is something else.  My hand just falls around it and sticks.  I'm not worried about slipping.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm pretty pleased with the knives and I like them.  The price was good so that's nice, but I hate that they took so long to get here.  I don't think I'll do any more Kickstarter campaigns for anything I really need at that time.  Regardless, I now have two very nice knives at a great price.

        "text": "So I'll keep this short. I've recently become obsessed with making refried beans at home as a filler to help keep our food budget down, and since I'm lazy and forget to soak the beans I've been making heavy use of my pressure cooker. But here's my problem.\n\nIn the [\"Pressure Cooker Refried Beans Recipe\"](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/pressure-cooker-refried-beans-vegetarian-mexican-recipe.html) by Michael Natkin the author explains how adding salt before cooking will toughen the bean skins.\n\nSimultaneously, though, in Kenji's writeup for [Quick and Easy Pressure Cooker Black Beans with Chorizo](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/10/how-to-make-quick-pressure-cooker-black-beans.html) he explains that adding salt is fine, and does not cause the beans skins to toughen - rather the opposite occurs.\n\n/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt can you help me out here? Trying to figure out which way is right, and then maybe the \"incorrect\" recipe can be edited so there's uniform advice on Serious Eats.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "So I got tasked with cooking a prime rib for my sister's birthday this past weekend, and I flubbed it. I was shooting for somewhere between medium and medium rare, but it was medium well. I think there are several places where I could have gone wrong, but maybe you all can help me decide what exactly it was.\n\nI followed Kenji's [Perfect Prime Rib recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/12/perfect-prime-rib-beef-recipe.html). I had a 9 pound USDA Choice bone-in rib roast. (I would have sprung for prime, but it was twice the price and I wasn't footing the bill, plus my family aren't the most discerning eaters anyway.) So I put it in at 200F. I had a Thermoworks ThermaQ leave-in probe to alert me when the roast hit 130F. I judged the time it would take to cook incorrectly, so an hour before I needed it to be done, I cranked the heat up to 300F. Then I got it out of the oven as soon as it hit 130F, ran it in the car to my mom's house, which took about 30 minutes, and used her 500F oven to crisp it up. But when I carved it, my heart immediately sank. It was mostly grey, the temp had climbed to 150F, and I felt great shame.\n\nI think there are several possibilities for what I did wrong...\n\n1) Obviously, I shouldn't have cranked the oven up to 300F. Could that higher heat have made the carryover cooking greater? 20 degrees seems like a lot of carryover. \n\n2) Could the amount of fat in the roast also have affected the carryover cooking, since it was Choice instead of Prime? I know leaner meats cook faster than fattier meats.\n\n3) For the car ride over, I put the roast in a crock pot. No lid, just aluminum foil loosely over the top, but could the crock pot have radiated heat back to the roast to keep it cooking? Or perhaps it just didn't let it rest properly, so when it went back in the 500F oven it started cooking basically where it had been already?\n\n4) I know it's possible my thermometer was off, but I don't think so. I've only used it twice before and it worked fine both times, and hasn't suffered any damage since.\n\nOr is there something else I did wrong? Thanks in advance, everybody. Help me not ruin good meat next time.",
