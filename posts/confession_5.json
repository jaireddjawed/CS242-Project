The prizes were honestly pretty sweet.  $1,200 RC cars, Tool sets, Guitars, Smokers, pellet grills, etc.  All quality name brand stuff, too.\n\nWhen it was a really nice prize like I mentioned I'd keep a very keen eye on the tickets or whatever people had.  I'd make a list and go over it to see who deserved it the most.  I always picked guys that were really putting in the work, giving me business, driven, etc.  I wanted to reward people for their hard work and let them feel like things were going well for them in life when they worked hard.  I didn't want the assholes to win by chance.\n\nIt felt really good to give a kid a $5,000 toolbox that was working his ass off and really trying to learn, and when you get a guy so excited he hugs you in such a masculine environment it's a win.",

So I decided to wager a author battle between me and chatgpt (I just switched who wrote which) and my friend off to be judge. \n\nHe read Chatgpt's(orginaly mine) and said it was the most creative story he has ever read, he loved the characters and their way of speaking along with their unique abilities. I laughed to myself \n\nI present mines(originally chatgpt's) and he went off on an insulting spree and telling me how the story is too complex and he dosen't understand anything. \n\nThis is all too humorous for me that I knew if I said the truth he would have called me a liar.

Cleaned some airbnbs because our housekeeper had an emergency came home did paper work till 630 and then had to get “right” just to calm down.  Not sure what I’m asking for in this confession.

        "text": "I met a guy on a therapy app a year ago back in October 2021. He had a problem which related to sex etc and his family. He was a bit older than me so i just remained anonymous and lied to him about my age, nationality and my life so that he would accept me and let me be his friend and support him. I was feeling very down and lonely at the time. Days went by and we talked more and more on telegram than ever and in January 2022 he confessed that he liked me and so did i. Even though i still kept hiding my true identity because i knew soo well that I wasn’t good enough for any man and that i was a horrible girl. I just wanted to be here for him and love him since he felt alone and struggled most of the time and he did the same to me as well which i am very thankful for. Months went by without me telling him about my true identity and we would talk almost every single day and flirt and be romantic with each other and send love letters and some fake pictures i had. I was soo in love with him and at a state were i was very depressed and numbed because i knew that i will never be able to make him my love partner accepting who i truly am. In may 2022, we had a little argument about him talking with another girl but then that was it i just felt very heartbroken from him but gradually tried to move on and forgive him because he needed a second chance and because he meant and still does mean the whole world to me. One month passed, and at the end of june. He finally knew that i am younger than him. He is 22 now. And that i live in a different place and look much uglier.. yea.. he was initially shocked and a bit hurt which i totally understand. I explained to him and apologized repeatedly for weeks and weeks about it and explained that he wouldn’t have talked to me if he knew who i truly was from the beginning and that i liked him from the first few times we spoke. He had something very unique and amazing about him. I find comfort with his talks and i feel very safe even though we never met. I made soo hopes on us but nothing worked. I was desperate to be loved because i never have been. I was surprised he really felt in love with me. So that made me ashamed to tell him who i am. This is my first ever time venting because i never talk about my problems to anyone ever. He stopped chatting with me much in august and since then he barely talks and is soo distant i tried to make it up soo many times. I feel ripped. Every single day crying and sobbing because i feel ashamed of me being me. If i was a different girl with much decent looks and background he would’ve met me. But it is my fault. I feel soo heartbroken because our love is gone. It’s been around 7 months now since he properly spoke to me. I am having suicidal thoughts, barely getting up to do things everyday. Just hit the gym to take away the pain. I want a solution.. i tried to move on because i am soo shocked from him suddenly moving away like this. Even though after the incident in june 2022 he spoke to me all the time for 2 months then suddenly went off. He no longer wants me. I barely think of anyone but him and even got into porn addiction to escape the depression and loneliness i am currently in. What in the world can i do anymore ..? I love him from the bottom of my heart and still write about him and dream of him all day.. i am soo in pain. I know it is my fault. I feel soo guilty. My hopes are soo unrealistic anymore..",

At the end of my shift, she said that I could have the pizza if I wanted it.\n\nAs I ate this pizza with my roommate, I came up with the idea that he could order a pizza right before close and just “not answer the door.” The next week, he called in an order with our address about 30 minutes before close. I drove there and we smoked a bowl and then I went back. And just like I planned, we got free dinner. We did this several times over the next couple months until I switched jobs. I wouldn’t feel bad if it was a big chain like dominoes but since it was a mom and pop shop I felt bad.",

        "text": "Just to put it clear. No I am not self harming in terms of cutting or slitting, I am purging my body by making myself throw up. I have been having issues with my boyfriend where it feels like I’m nothing but an annoyance to him. Every time I do something wrong or even when I feel like I do something wrong like annoy him or say the wrong thing or anything negative, my mind goes in this state of attacking myself by making me feel like I’m the reason to every wrong thing to exist. I feel like to need to punish myself by starving and throwing up. I am recently been trying to become the skinniest I can by restricting my diet extremely knowing very well I can possible suffer heart problems. I want to almost see how far I can go. It’s scary, it’s probably also important to mention that I am bipolar, so I can’t stop my impulsive actions.\nWhen I feel like I upset my boyfriend I will make myself throw up and starve myself as well as just internally beat myself up in my mind. I used to be scared of reaching an anorexic state but I don’t think I care anymore because I feel like i ruin everything. It’s scary how aware I am of my actions but not scared of the consequences.",
