One of our drivers is cutting and I find him sorting through pizzas trying to figure out why the ticket says 8 pizzas but 9 were made. I find a strange incorrectly topped supreme and put it away and check off all the pizzas on the order. As Im doing this a customer enters and asks for the order. I hand it off to her and read through the order, easy. 2 hrs later she calls back. Area manager and Franchisee are in store. Really don't want to attract negative attention here.\n\"I ordered 9 pizzas where is the 9th!?\" I find her previous ticket.\n\"Uh sorry maam, your ticket only says 8\"\n\"No thats incorrect I definitely ordered 9, but I paid for 8. The 9th was another meatlovers\" \nTicket has 1x meatlovers \nAt this point I consider whether climbing in the oven or disconnecting the gas line would be the fastest death.\n\"Okay maam well since you didnt pay for the 9th I can set that up as a paid delivery\"\nI can hear her telling a friend in the background that she totally ordered 9 but paid for 8.\n\"I am a teacher at a school and there are kids that are hungry because you didnt give me 9 pizzas.\"\n\"Sorry maam but we just made the order as we recieved it and it was paid for, is it too late to take a delivery order for the kids?\"\n\"I guess next time I'll have to order more\" and hangs up.\nProbably not the best solution, but we made no error. At least she didnt want to escalate the issue and at least admitted her fault.",

        "text": "This happend last year, as I just recently found this subreddit. (And it's also my first time posting on reddit, yay!)\n\n\nI used to work for Joey's Pizza in germany, wich does now belong to Domino's. \n\n\nOne day I had a delivery to a apartment building, including a pizza, pizza buns and garlic dip. I took the heating bag out of my bike and rang the main door. When I was opened, half way up the stairs I noticed that I had forgotten the garlic dip. I remembered that the protocol expects me that if I make a mistake I should act in a way that I will have more work but not that the customer gets his meal any later than necessary. Plus, I would have to ring the bell a second time and the costumer would ask why. So I decided to go upstairs further. When I arrived at the costomers appartment, I handed him the pizza and the pizza buns, cashed and told him that I would be right back because I forgot his garlic dip in the bikebag. He said okay and I quickly descended to the ground floor. So that I wouldn't have to ring again, I put my cap inbetween the lock of the main entrance. I went to my bike, took the garlic dip, took the cap out of the lock and rushed up the stairs, as I know that I am already wasting time. At maximum one and a half minutes passed since I talked to the costumer. I rang the bell of this appartment, and nothing happend. \n\nI rang again.... nothing. \n\nI knocked.... nothing. \n\nI stood there for about 2 minutes, ringing and knocking, I knew that I didn't have time for this. \nSo I put the dip in front of his door, rang two more times and went back to the store.\nAbout an hour later, my shift was going to end. I was already checked out and only had to leave the room when the phone rang. Since everybody was busy, the PM asked me if I could pick up, although I was already checked out. \n\nI did it, because I quite like picking the phone and taking orders. \n\nI picked up and responded with a shockingly nice version of \"Welcome to Dominos, this is [me], how can I help you.\"\n\nA womans voice answered. \n\n\"Yeah, hey, uhm... my boyfriend recently ordered a pizza and pizza buns, but the driver forgot the garlic dip. He went down getting it, but never showed up.\" \nI was suprised, as I had nearly already forgotten it. \n\"Wow... yeah... that was me. I rang at your door but you didn't open.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I placed your dip in front of your door, as I had to leave at some point.\"\n\n\"WHAT!? What kind of IDIOT are you that you fail such a simple task!?\"\n\nI started talking in a serious, defending voice, almost getting a bit loud. \n\n\"Wait, no! This is NOT my fault! I DID rung! You didn't open!\"\n\n\"Yeah, maybe we didn't open because we are tired of seeing you.\"\n\n\"wha.... what kind of B****HIT is THAT? This is no valid argument!\"\n\n\"What counts is, that we now have to eat your cold sh*t because we thought you would show up at some point.\" \n\nI tried to calm myself.\n\n\"I am sorry for the inconvienience, but it was definitley not my fault! And why do you call so late?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I can see how you're sorry. I thought you would get your job done at some point! Thanks for nothing! Bye!\"\n\nI was about to drop the phone back on it's charging station, when I noticed my boss (the leaderess of the store, not the PM) standing beside me, having heard all. (Well at least, heard what I said) \nI supposed some commentary like \"Don't let you get down by this, some people are assholes.\"\n\nBut instead she said \"Have you gone insane? You can't talk to a customer like that! What were you thinking!?\"\n\n\"You didn't hear what she was like. She just talked nonsense and insulted me.\"\n\n\"I don't care what she told you! If we lost this costumer, we lost a four-digit amout of money! The average costomer spends about 5000â‚¬ in his life at our store!\"\n\n\"That value sounds rediculus, honestly. And no matter what you say, I will not be friendly to someone insulting me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you will! This discussion is over now! P*ss off before I decide to hold you liable for the lost income!\"\n\nIt was the only time I cried at home because of work. \n\nEDIT: Added double Line breaks, as it seems to be necessary for formatting on some devices\nEDIT2: Changed some spelling errors, turning the cosplay convention back to normal people\n",

Get there, give the person the pizza and the bag. Easy. I come back to the store and my manager says\n\n\"Yo these people just called and said they didn't get their salad can you run it out to them?\" \n\nAnd I'm like \n\n\"What the fuck, that's bullshit I'm CERTAIN I gave em their salad what a bunch of cunts. Like they're literally lying what the fuck.\" \n\nAnyway I took the new salad out to the car and it turns out the original salad slid out of the bag and was sitting on the floor in the back. Not sure how I missed that when I gave them a saladless bag but I ended up just giving em both salads to make up for my incompetence. \n\nYou guys ever had any situations like that, when you were pissed at a costumer/coworker and it turns out to be entirely your fault? \n\nEDIT: they were also dressed up in funny costumes. \n\nEDIT 2: The last edit was a shitty joke based on my typo.

        "text": "Remembering stories as I'm on vacation.\n\nSo I'm working as a morning driver and I get an order to take one medium pepperoni pizza to a house by one of the elementary schools.\n\nStandard order, pepperoni pizzas are always shitty because you're never going to get a good tip on those, especially when its a medium. But it's morning driving so meh.\n\nDuring this time, we had an hour long delivery time when they placed the order. There were about 4 orders on the screen, but the second driver came in, and I took a double pretty quickly, so we managed to get the screen clear with just that one order in about 20-25 minutes. \n\nGood for us, we get to deliver it early.\n\nSo I drive my little dinky ass pepperoni pizza to this house in a very okay area, and I knock on the door. No response. So I go through my usual, double check the address, knock again, call with no message, knock again, and then I call a second time.\n\nA young girl with a thick Ethopian accent answers the phone.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Hi, this is CDFReditum from Pizza Hut, I'm here with your pizza\"\n\"no\"\n\nbitch what do you mean no\n\nSo we go through the predictable conversation when people assume that the expected time means that we'll come exactly in 60 minutes rather than \"we say 60 to be safe\"\n\n\"You said 60 minutes on the phone!\"\n\"Yeah, but we managed to get things done quick so we got here a little early (A little admittedly being about 30-40 minutes early)\"\n\"Well we're not home we're at church\"\n\"(&gt;wednesday morning) Oh okay! Well when will you be home? I can wait for a little bit!\"\n\"30 minutes!\"\n\"a\"\n\". . .\"\nI knew that I had to pull the plug. I knew that I had to do what I hated doing.\n\n\"Okay so I'll head back to the store and bring it back in about 30 minutes.\"\n\nNote that I don't really get extra mileage for taking back a pizza. Sometimes my managers will be able to get me the extra mileage by CSing the 1st order and re-entering the order as a separate thing (which is also nice because it doesn't screw up delivery times). But I guess I have to do it.\n\nSo I pop back to the store and we're hitting the usual stride of orders on a wednesday early afternoon, which is like an order every 20-30 minutes. Good, I can make the delivery order, deliver it, come back, and pop over to that other house.\n\nThe phone rings\n\n\"Hi welcome to Pizza Hut, will this be for delivery or carryout!\"\n\"HELLO WHERE IS MY PIZZA\"\n\nMy time has come.\n\n\"Oh you must be the house I called earlier! It's sitting hot and ready in our oven right now, and I'll be driving it to you right now\"\n\"You guys said 60 minutes!\"\n\"*re-explaining the situation*\"\n\"Well we won't be home for another 45 minutes!\"\n(NOTE: It was about 10 minutes before the order was due, which is pretty standard delivery when things are on time).\n\"O-Oh.\"\n\nidk why we have this pizza. idk who wants to eat this pizza. It's an hour old in this oven, it's a single pepperoni pizza, and apparently the daughter ordered it for herself.\n\nBut man my manager can't do anything about it. I have to take this. This has become the brunt of my day. By god, it is my solemn duty to give this Ethiopian girl her medium pepperoni pizza delivered to her.\n\nOf course when I go in they're not ready to do anything. It almost seemed like a surprise that they were getting a pizza, they had no money on their person, took forever to find their purse, some 3rd unrelated person ended up paying for it, the usual stuff when the world is in the mood to give me no tips.\n\n$2 tip.\n\nPlease, for the love of god, when you purchase a delivery, please be  home. If you want it delivered at a certain time, then do a future order. (Arguably you could say that they might have wanted to do that but couldn't because of the hour long wait time, but they weren't home at that time either so ???). If you REALLY REALLY REALLY want to go out before your pizza comes, I'd say that your safest bet is to order the pizza 10 minutes before (MAYBE 20 minutes if the delivery time is high) you get home. It takes 10 minutes to make a pizza.\n\nPlease\n\nI know you want to be smart and beat the system and have a fresh and hot pizza waiting for you from a very attractive delivery man 2 minutes after you get home, please don't. It won't work. It will never work. (NOTE: This actually worked twice where I was doing my first or second knock and they pulled up and got home, running up and handing me money with usually a good ass tip. But I've had many more situations like these.) Primarily if you don't even fucking know what time you'll be home, don't order something from a time sensitive business.\n\nAt least they had money when I showed up. . . unlike some other person I drove to. . . (which is a story for later)",

        "text": "We had a substitute manager recently who switched our Pepsi deliveries to every other week for no known reason. So of course, now we only have two drinks 20 oz bottle varieties that are actually listed on our website, and we're low on those. We got a customer who ordered four bottles of Diet Pepsi, but we only had three.\n\nInstead of using our entire stock of Diet Pepsi 20 oz bottles, we decided to give him two 2 liter bottles (with six cups) because we had a bunch of those and each big bottle is actually 67 fl oz. When I get to his town home, he's waiting just inside the door, which he opens as I approach. As soon as I start explaining the drink situation, he starts shaking his head.\n\n\"That won't do,\" he says, \"I need the four bottles.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I begin, putting a cheery note in my voice because he already seems mad at the world, \"well, we actually didn't have enough twenty--\"\n\n\"I don't care. It's that there are four people drinking it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I brought cups!\" I reassure him, turning the bad to show him.\n\n\"No. I need the bottles.\"\n\n\"It's actually--\"\n\n\"I don't care about the amount. I don't care if you're giving me more; I need the bottles.\"\n\nNow keep in mind that we run out of the smaller bottles every once in a while, so I've had to bring two-liter bottles several times, and the customers aren't just understanding, but they usually at least pretend to be glad to be receiving the equivalent of almost seven bottles for the price of four. Not this guy.\n\n\"So...you want me to bring you the four bottles instead?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" comes the gruff response.\n\n\"Well, we only have three left, so I would have to stop at a store to get another,\" I return, hoping he'll just take the better value.\n\n\"Then just give me a regular one,\" he grumbles.\n\n\"Do you mean the two-liter?\" I ask, doubling down on the hope he'll be reasonable.\n\n\"No, give me a regular Pepsi.\"\n\nWell, we didn't have any of those, so let's just skip the rest and say that it ended with my manager making a note in this guy's account.",

        "text": "So we were pretty slow last night.  I had a single delivery to an apartment complex.  I go there, knock on the door; no answer.  I ring the doorbell, no answer.  I call the phone number, straight to voicemail.  I leave a text message, no response, so I leave.\n\nI get back to the store, and about 10 minutes later they call, wanting to know where they pizza is.  The girl on the phone sounds high AF.  I tell her I already went there, no one answered the door.  She says I must have went to the wrong apartment.  I confirm the apartment, and then describe exactly where it is in the building (it was an end apartment, so easy to describe.)  I ask if she wants me to bring it back out to her.  She says yes, then claims it can't possibly still be hot.  I tell her that it's only 30 minutes old now, and it was in a hot bag or under the heat lamps since it was made, so it's still hot.  She complains again, I tell her that if she had answered the door when I was there 15 minutes ago it's would be really hot, and again asked it she still wanted it.  She finally said yes, she paid for it, she wants it.\n\nSo I make the 4 minute drive over there, and two girls answer the door.  The first one (the phone one) is actually pretty nice, apologizes for the mix-up, and then the second one suddenly starts in on me.  She says I didn't have to be so rude on the phone.  I tell her I was just trying to figure out why they didn't answer the door the first time, to see if the problem was on our end or their end.  I then recite the phone number on the box and ask them if the phone number was correct.  The first girl immediately says, no, I must have screwed up when I entered it online.  I then tell them that it's aggravating when I have to make return trips, and the second girls is like, \"That's your job\".  Then I retort that answering the door when we arrive is YOUR job.  The first girl then finally admits that they 'might have been' walking the dog the first time I came by.\n\nI was like, \"So you WEREN'T here the first time I came by\" turned around and left.\n\nSo they called me incompetent and rude; turns out they gave the wrong phone number and were not at the apartment.",

For months now I've been putting up with shit from a shift manager, being spoken to like crap, treat differently and given ALL the dodgy delivery addresses and accused of lying all the time. Heck I have to get up recent calls and prove to them ive called a customer if I've returned to the store after no answer. I stopped calling the store before returned too as they'd demand I took a photo with myself stand in it. I've been accused of going on long journeys for no reason even though I explained it's not a long journey, I just don't come back the same way I went, especially after being mugged twice.. At most it's a 2 minute extra or sometimes shorter journey. Fuck I even get accused if needlessly filling up with fuel. The scooter only takes at most Â£4 worth of fuel and having to go flat out on a 50cc little thing with a big fuck off box on the back means I gotta fill up before every shift. I've now gotta let this specific manager inspect the tank before I go. He's also made me add him on Find My Friends on ios so he can track where ever I am, even though the scooters have a tracker built in for upper management to view.\n\nI got setup by a customer last week who distracted me whilst his friends stole the delivery scooter. Every bit of it was on CCTV and the bike was recovered after being chased by the Police. Not once did I get asked if I was okay, instead I was accused of being involved or lying. It's all on camera for fuck sake!\n\nAnd the final straw ontop of all of that was coming into work after two days off to find someone had cut the cable on my own personal helmet that I use (their helmets don't fit my head, plus it's Bluetooth so I can listen to music and satnav) and pissed inside of it before putting it back ontop of my locker.. Fucking pissed inside of it! \n\nStore Manager doesn't give a fuck, Area Manager doesn't give a fuck, nobody seems to give a fuck. Its not asif I'm a terrible driver too, I'm in the top 5 of highest performing drivers in the area. I'm fed up of coming home and just crying from all the stress. I've loved delivering pizzas, getting out on the road and meeting some interesting customers but I'm looking for a new job as fast as I can!\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just needed somewhere to rant  :/.\n\nTL;DR, shift supervisor pissed inside my helmet, left it in a hot room for two days and now it's fucked.",

I go through the spiel and get the customer's info and when I get to the order screen I see his last order.\n\nMe:\" Your last order was 1 large pepperoni, 2 large Italian sausages, and 1 large bacon, everything with ranch base.\"\n\n\nCust:\" No im gunna order something else, your 4 pizzas for 8.99 each.\"\n\n\nMe:\" Alright sir (clears entire order) what can I get you?\"\n\n\nCust: \"I'd like 1 with Italian sausages, 1 pepperoni, wait make that 2 with Italian sausages, and a bacon pizza and all of them with ranch instead of red sauce.\"\n\n\nMe:\"...ok...\"\n\nI read his order back to him, quote him the time, hang up and tell my coworkers about this idiot. Atleast he was nice.",

        "text": "This is mostly dealing with some garbage that happened earlier this week and my boss's response to it. It's really months of frustration hitting a boiling point, though. I'll break it up into 2 parts for convenience.\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\n\nI'm the senior-most driver where I work, with over a 3 year tenure(christ). I enjoy my job, because I'm usually pretty good at it and I get to drive around listening to Slayer all day. I do basically everything besides making pizza and rolling dough, because we have dedicated people for that. I pride myself on trying not to be a moocher; I'm worthwhile to employ, beyond my job description and I follow the philosophy of making sure everything gets done properly outside of what's specifically expected of me.\n\n\nMy boss is the owner(We'll call him Ray), he's there pretty much every day. Other than that, we usually have a cook and 2-4 drivers per shift. None of these people are a problem save a single driver that is a straight up leech(We'll call him Peter). He fits descriptions of what others have complained about on this sub: only in it for tips, hounds the dispatch and memorizes what everyone tips, throws fits anytime things don't go his way, straight up sabotages the store to try and get the best deliveries, does the bottom line with everything, refuses to do any closing work besides dishes and his lack of work is secured by the fact that he's shitty to a point where you don't want him doing it anyway. Peter's saving grace is that he is fairly fast at delivery(he is only faster than my, because his fucking dad pays for a toll road pass for him, which shaves as much as 20 minutes off of a delivery under certain circumstances, this guy is like 33). Working with him is so draining that I remember every shift I've ever done alone with him, because they're the only times I've considered just walking the fuck out.\n\n\nObviously I stand diametrically opposed to this Peter, because I give a shit about work ethic and he doesn't. The kicker here is that he gets away with it, because society will always make room for moochers. My effort is rewarded with higher expectations, whereas he works to keep his expectations at rock bottom in every area save delivery. This is where my real issue begins: he doesn't get reprimanded for fucking anything he does. Last week, he told a regular never to order again, because he was far and only tipped $3. *Boss didn't care.* Few months back, he told off a customer and used a fake name(of a former driver, actually) to avoid anyone finding out. *Boss didn't care.* Last year, he intentionally shorted a 13 year old kid change, so he'd get a tip and his parents noticed and complained. *Boss didn't care, covered for him, actually.* The guy takes shots of vodka with one customer every time he delivers to him. *Boss doesn't know, but I can probably guess what wouldn't happen if he found out.*\n\n\n\n\n**Events of This Week**\n\n\n\nI do Monday and Tuesday with just Ray and one other driver(not Peter), so if it gets a little busy, things slow down very quickly. This Tuesday we were fairly slammed, both of us were taking triples all day. Somewhere around 7, I dispatch on a triple that included 2 in one city(Pink) and one out of the way in a different city(Green). The Pinks sandwiched the Green in the order, the Green was on the way to the Pinks direction wise. They were weekly customers and had an order close to $100, while the other 2 were pretty small. We were running behind anyway and I decided to do them out of order, delivering the Green first, then the Pinks after words. At most, it added 7 minutes(or so I thought) to the delivery time for the pink that was intended to be delivered first. \n\n\nThe result was the first pink losing his shit, calling my boss, yelling at me. His words: \"*Dude this pizza is an hour and a half late and your manager doesn't give a shit, so I'm not gonna eat your fuckin' pizza.*\" I walk down, flustered, call my boss: \"*You're so stupid, it was supposed to go first and you took it last!*\", which wasn't true, but okay. Third delivery went fine. I was pissed that I was pinned for this, because all the orders were late, this guy ordered online(doesn't give you proper delivery time), and I was put in a position where I either choose which customers to satisfy properly or play /r/maliciouscompliance and inefficiently take them in the dispatch order. **Side note: Shit wasn't even my fault. The guy orders online and his ticket sits there, not entered into the POS for at least 30 mins. I've been specifically complaining about this for months, it happens a lot and we finally had a cancellation due to it.**\n\n\nI wrote down my justification, because I didn't feel like explaining it while we were both mad. Gave him the note and that's the last that was said until today.\n\n\n\nToday was a shitshow, Rey decided I'm not qualified to take triples at all. Took 2 extra hours to clear the dispatch. I'm normally off by 8:30, but today had me on until after 10 all to punish me(it's true his punishment made me extra money, but he's also aware that I don't care about that). This is beyond me, because last week fucking Peter intentionally lost a customer, I do the same thing on accident and it's not even my mistake and it's the end of the world. I called him out on having a ridiculous double standard and all I got back was something about how he gave me extra chances when I was new. I became a better driver over time, Peter has been garbage since day one(in fact he's been doing this shit for 10 years apparently) and he never changes his behavior. I make honest mistakes and he deliberately does stupid shit to benefit himself and sabotage everyone else. What it comes down to is that absolute flawlessness is expected of me, which I am totally fine with, but it's endlessly frustrating to have the fucking free loader getting away with shit in front of me every day.\n\n\nI know this post is probably drenched with bias, but I'm sure others have similar stories. I'm out of this place in a few months, when I'll start posting my ravings on /r/talesfromtechsupport, but this summer is going to bleed my dry. I feel like shit. It fucking sucks, because I like my job and I respect my boss, but I have a really hard time reconciling this double standard garbage. I think it's more of a philosophical thing, how do you deal with the fact that putting in more effort doesn't actually gain you an advantage over the moocher? I think I hate myself less, but what's that worth if I feel like this as an alternative?\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Get shit done overall and get treated with standards for my performance miles higher than another driver that does nothing at all and gets preferential treatment for being fast.\n\nEdit1: Sorry for this godawful wall of text.",

        "text": "Happened about two years ago when I was working for Papa Johns. I can't remember if I took the delivery initially but I clearly remember what happened after. My manager had stopped me and asked me to go to the customers house (my delivery initially, or I was heading that way. Don't remember.) apparently when they ordered they said no seasoning packets (for the thin) because someone in the house was allergic to it. Whoever took the order must have forgotten to tell the rest of us. Well, the customer called, irate. Wanted us to come and pick up the packets, and take them back. The store was terrified of getting bad reviews so the manager sent me on my way. I get there and the guy opens the door about 5 minutes later, frowning but doesn't say a word. Just gives me the two little packets because he couldn't be moved to throw them away himself. \n\nBonus story: before THAT I worked at another pizza place. I delivered a salad and a pizza and cheesesticks to an older lady just down the road. She called back before I even got back to the store, bitching about getting the wrong sauce. The receipt said ranch but really what she wanted was blue cheese or whatever. Okay... So I drive out there with the new sauce, get to the door, and she answers she's absolutely pissed. There's a young girl behind her with a forlorn look on her face. Older lady bitches while I give her the sauce, and hands me the sauce we originally gave her. It's in a bag it didn't come in, she's all snooty at this point, tells me to do whatever with it, claims the cheese sticks didn't have enough cheese on it and slams the door in my face. ",

        "text": "One of my favorite parts of being a delivery driver is getting able to see all the dogs people have.\n\nSo we have this regular customer, Kaleb, at the place I work at, he orders multiple times a week and ALWAYS right before I'm about to leave, causing me to stay and delivery it. If anybody else were to order a pizza for delivery so late, I'd get pretty pissed, but this guy is pretty chill and doesn't live that far from the restaurant so I usually don't mind.\n\nAnyway, Kaleb lives behind a chain link fence that never opens, so every interaction I've had with him had the fence between us. Every time I deliver to his place, his little brown chihuahua always runs up to the fence and starts barking at me followed by Kaleb yelling at the dog to \"shut the fuck up.\" I've never seen Kaleb with anybody else before besides his dog, I'm positive he has friends, but he only lives with his dog. \n\nEarlier this week when I delivered to him, he showed up by the fence alone, without the dog. I greeted him, \"Hey how's it going, man?\" \n\nHe says \"what's up\" back, but shortly after he says, \"My dog just got hit by a car, man\"\n\nI immediately gasp, and ask if the dog was okay, he then tells me he was found dead on the side of the road just two hours before. He told me that the dog is usually chained up, but somehow got out and escaped the fence. \n\nKaleb seemed really bummed, and every time I told him I was sorry he would reply, \"It's all good, man.\" But you could tell that it wasn't. \n\nI never even pet the dog before, I didn't even know the dog's name, but it made me so sad that I almost cried. It was there every single time I delivered, but now it's dead. \n\nI wasn't thinking at the time, but I really should have paid for his meal.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this experience that kinda fucked me up for a bit. Anybody else have stories about dogs they have encountered on deliveries?\n",

        "text": "Today was pretty slow since most everyone had blown their pizza money last night watching the Warriors edge out the Cavs in what was all around a very interesting basketball game. Deliveries were few and far between and orders were being made with impeccable accuracy thanks to us getting them pretty much one at a time. We get an order to that's to an address we don't really recognize partly because they comically misspelled a major street but we're able to figure out where it's supposed to go. It's one pizza and one order of wings to make the absolute minimum one needed to get food delivered to them. Lucky me, I ended up getting that delivery\n\nI go to what I assumed was the correct address if you weren't a complete imbecile who spells the name of the street they work on wrong and for a moment I genuinely think it might be a set-up since the parking lot is deserted save for 2 run down looking cars. I decide against my better judgement to cautiously make my way in and beyond the first door and lo and behold it's a weed shop; the saddest excuse for a weed shop that is.\n\nFor those of you that don't have any sort of weed clinics in your neck of the woods let me tell you how they usually look and compare it to this shithole. For starters, clinics are cash-only businesses thanks to the legal limbo they're in right now (at least here in California) and often have at least one armed guard posted outside the door with the gnarliest looking guns that the state of California will allow a private citizen to own giving off as much of a do-not-fuck-with-this-place vibe as they can. The \"Guard\" they had here had a nappy looking rent a cop uniform, a small canister of mace, and a leather cell phone pouch positioned to look like to was a magazine pouch that wasn't fooling anyone. I was significantly better armed than this guy with a pocket knife and a general sense of alertness. Secondly, weed shops will have a sort of screening area with tempered glass you have to go through before entering the luxurious showroom filled with the goods; think large jewelry shop but with drugs instead of diamonds and you've got it. this place had a thin wall with a window-hole in it and a flimsy door sporting a sign that said \n&gt;\"just push doornob[sic] doesn't work\"\n\nI didn't end up going in but I caught and eyeful of what it looked like on the inside and was surprised considering the investment needed to get so much as a permit for this kind of business. inside an otherwise barren 1500 square foot office space was one 8' glass display containing maybe half a dozen mason jars full of what looked and smelled like very cheap, low grade marijuana. As a point of reference my sister worked as a Bud-tender in what would be considered a typical clinic down in Santa Ana. By the standards that clinic set I'm not even sure that this place could be called a weed shop.\n\nSo I get approached by the security guard who asks me how much it is and then starts rummaging through his pockets trying to get to $17. he only comes up with $7 and starts literally jumping up and down trying to see if he has any change. The girl who I guessed was the clerk/bud-tender/whatever who the nicest word I can think to describe her is... unwashed comes up to help pitch in. All the while I'm waiting for them to scrap together the money for this. all the while they're asking me for forks, free ranch, pepper/cheese (which for some reason our chain charges for now) plates, napkins, anything they think they can get for free from us. They even ask for goddamned spoons. After telling them that we don't carry those things unless paid for in advance or asked for before the driver leaves the store the security guy and the girl throw a little fit and the guard goes on about \"how he was gonna tip me but not anymore.\" Bruh I'll be fucking surprised if you even scrap together enough cash for me to hand over this pizza. they eventually do after a while and I hand over the pie and the chicken so I can get on with my life.\n\nAs I get back, *what a surprise*, the girl from the weed shop called to complain about not getting the wings she wanted which the manager who received the call knew was a bold faced lie since several people checked the order and now there's a remake in the delivery queue. Of course there's now an added comment containing a long list of free things they'd like us to bring (some of which we don't even stock), yet the street name is still horrendously spelled wrong. I was slotted to take it but I flat out refuse, opting instead to take a delivery to the far fringes of our range to a high rise apartment. The AM doesn't stop me and tells me how rude the weed shop lady was over the phone. Someone finally ends up taking the remake but not without taking another order since it's known that they have no money to tip with and they're extremely rude to boot. The driver only takes 2 plates and some napkins to satisfy their lust for freebies (pretty much everything else they asked for was something they had to pay for anyway).\n\nThis is actually kind of sad considering that a business that should have a fuckload of cash on hand can barely scrap together 17 bucks after a trip to someone's car. I almost think that maybe this clinic was started by some poor sucker who heard that \"modern day green rush\" ad on the radio and got roped into a near-predatory business loan based on some program that features numbered steps and being a member of some \"team\". Maybe those two losers were the only people that this person is able to keep on their payroll. That's not my problem though. Lucky for my fellow drivers and I we have a feeling it's going to be a while before they can scavenge $17 to cover another delivery order.",

With that said complicated orders late at night spawn minor mistakes.\n\nStory: Steven places his order, \"large thin 'supreme'. Add pineapple, jalapeno, sliced sausage, and left half no onions. Piecut.\"\nI tell my closing driver to not fuck the order up otherwise we'll be here all night making this asshole free pizzas. \nHe makes the pizza and I pull it out of the oven to find he didn't add the sliced sausage. \nI then make the pizza and pull it out.

It took a little bit of coaxing but I got the dog to come over to me. Before somebody says that I shouldn't have tried this, keep in mind I've done this multiple times but only when we're not super busy.\n\nAs the dog is approaching me some idiot in a giant lifted pickup truck with LEDs as bright as the sun pulls up next to me. He screamed out his window as loud as he could, \"Hey Papa John's do you have any free pizzas?\" This scared off the dog causing him to scramble into traffic again. \n\nHere's the issue: I don't work for Papa John's, he's screwed up my attempt to save this dog comma and of course we don't have free fucking Pizza in our car. It would have been so simple for this asshole to just not say anything. Plus, this dude had three teeth, a Budweiser trucker hat, and both of his eyes were pointed into different directions.

Now fortunately he had it in his car, so few extra seconds and everything was peachy.\n\nBut I was curious, if he had left it in the store and had to make another trip to get it, would it have been bad form to get $5 back from his tip?  I wasn't gonna take all of it, but instead of 7 and change it would be 2 and change.\n\nTo me I feel it would have been justified.  I mean he would have forgot an entire item off my order.

        "text": "[Previously...](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/63hasf/that_one_time_there_was_a_crazy_huge_storm/?st=j3m4t44i&amp;sh=25d5d9e7)\n\nBack in January we had this crazy huge storm that ended up flooding most of the streets in out area and making the already intense amount of deliveries we had for football semi-finals a herculean feat. During that night someone who probably shouldn't have been hired in the first place but he got in on another employee's endorsement and literally begging to the GM was fired for having a meltdown. I was meaning to post this a while ago but things kept on happening concerning this dude and his inability to move on with his life and leave us alone.\n\nA few hours after the big storm had cleared and we were closing shop, our AM sent a message to the now-defunct driver group chat congratulating us on our perseverance in the face of a screwed up situation. This driver, who we'll call LawBoy, blows up the group chat with a rant that is probably longer than this whole story will be about how we're all \"heartless monsters\" and how \"he was sick and tried to open his feelings to us\" and we just rejected him with \"inhuman cruelty\". The AM responded with something along the lines of of 'even if we're as evil as you say we are, that doesn't excuse how you treated us last night and you're still fired.' A few other people who witnessed LawBoy's meltdown chimed in to back up the AM and it was the last we heard of it... for the time being.\n\nThe next morning I was scheduled to work with the GM who had convinced the Franchisee to rush order LawBoy's final check so we wouldn't have to deal with him anymore since he always seemed more than a bit on the unstable side. I was out on delivery when LawBoy came in to turn in his shirts and collect his check but the GM and the other driver filled me in on what happened. LawBoy shuffled into the store and placed his dirty shirts on the counter. Our GM begins to hand him his check wordslessly but then LawBoy mumbles,\n\n&gt;\"Do you know the law?\" \n\nThe GM replies,\n\n&gt;\"Yes, we are an at-will employer and your actions-\"\n\nThe GM is cut off by Lawboy\n\n&gt;\"No, I said do you know the LAW?!\"\n\nGM isn't having it\n\n&gt;\"look if you want I can give you my supervisor's contact info and you can take it up with him. You want you check or what?\"\n\nLawBoy Persists \n\n&gt;\"DO YOU KNOW THE LAW??\"\n\nGM stands his ground in the face of about 130lbs of red-faced angst\n\n&gt;\"So you want my supervisor's number or what?\"\n\nLawBoy mumbles something else, takes his check and shuffles out of the store. The phrase, \"Do you know the law?\" becomes an in-joke at my store and a de-facto reply to whenever you didn't get your way over in some petty matter. For example, \"My good sir, I'm on over duty right now, do you know the law?\" or \"The lady at KFC almost gave me original chicken instead of the extra crispy. Does she even know the law?\" And as the joke died down we thought that was the end of LawBoy... Or so we thought again.\n\nA couple months later I'm unsure what to get for lunch on my day off so I press the resturants button on Google Maps and I notice my own store pop up. I click on the reviews out of morbid curiosity and the first one I see when I sorted by recent is by none other than LawBoy (using his real name in the review no less) giving us a scathing 1 star review talking about how we were awful people and this and that, even mentioning that he worked here. I took a few screenshots of this review and sent it to the GM as so we could have a few laughs before reporting it for conflicts of interest. We later learn from another driver (not the one who got LawBoy Hired) who happened to rent a room from LawBoy and his Parents (surprise, surprise, LawBoy lives at home) that he *was* working for Uber Eats now but he washed out. He is the first and only person I've ever heard of to not make the cut for Uber Eats. He had also quite another job about a week and a half in because his arms were sore. And that was the end of LawBoy's involvement with out store... or so we thought, for the third time.\n\nA month or so later I come in for a shift to find the GM, the DM, franchisee, and someone who looked like he might have been some form of advocate for the franchisee looking concerned about something. I mind my business and later on when everybody who didn't have some sort of daily task to be at the store left the GM told me that LawBoy had filed a formal complaint with the department of labor and was trying to do everything in his power to get back at us. At the point Lawboy had been fired for over 4 months and before that he had only worked with us for about 2 and a half months before that. According to the phone call from the representative of the Dept of Labor LawBoy claimed that we refused to give him breaks or rest periods and that we were a hostile work enviorment, blah blah blah...\n\n**BULL. SHIT.**\n\nLawBoy was always sitting on the unfolded boxes in the back munching on reject pizza weather or not it was appropriate to do so and whenever he wasn't he just followed around the guy that got him hired trying to be his Multi-Level-Marketing wing-man. Once the guy who lives with LawBoy comes in and learns of this development he tells us something interesting. It turns out that this is just what LawBoy and his family do: Whenever they're even slightly wronged by any organization they romanticize their plight, go get a flea-bitten, second rate attorney, and try to sue their so-called tormentors into the dirt. Lucky for us, LawBoy has made every mistake possible in trying to use the legal system and before he's even filed the actual court papers we had a 4-pronged defense. We had the accounts of the AMs who he lost his shit at that fateful night, we had the end-of-shift sign off sheets from his every shift that he signed started that he had gotten all this proper breaks and whathaveyou, we had my screenshots of the review which showed how LawBoy was just on some sort of delusional warpath to being us down any way he could, and finally we had another driver who LawBoy had told that he had spent the whole night smoking tons of pot and playing video games which lead to him being in the state he was in that rainy night. The other driver seemed to be okay with helping in the defense of the store so we were feeling pretty good about our defense. I decided to explain to the guy that lived with LawBoy just how bad it would end for LawBoy if he tried to pursue this and asked him to at least try to explain to LawBoy and his family that this wasn't a good idea, and that he should really consider withdrawing his complaint with the Dept of Labor since we had hard proof to discredit everything he'd said, which could mean a whole lot of bad things for him. I didn't exactly like LawBoy by any stretch of imagination but a libel lawsuit or maybe even prison time was the last thing he needed in his life.\n\n Days went by, then weeks, and now here we are in June with not a peep from LawBoy or anyone representing him. Maybe that was the last we'll hear of LawBoy... or so I hope.\n\n...\n\nYup, I'm pretty sure LawBoy's group chat rant was longer than this post.",

Will provide proof to mods if needed.\n\nSo we pretty much all can agree that sometimes customers waste our time. Sometimes it's just a little, but it's probably adding up to a lot. \n\nYou know how it goes: They give the wrong address or forget details, they don't know how to buzz you in so they slowly make their way down to meet you, they order when they aren't home for another 15 minutes, don't hear you knock cuz they're in the basement blasting Skynard, takes them 3 minutes to come to the door cuz they're looking for money, forgot to turn their ringer on, they don't answer unfamiliar numbers even though they requested a call, and on and on. \n\nFor those of us who work for the very cost-conscious places (ones who find every way possible to keep their employees busy every second of the day to get their money's worth) this seems like an obvious waste of labor money that could be addressed. If we drivers could cut down on our waiting for the customer time, we could make more runs and get more money, so win-win situation! \n\nI'm thinking that one way to combat this is to have the company give customers a very clear message (especially those with online ordering enabled) about being ready to receive their delivery. My big 3 shop has a 5 minute rule for when you can leave if you are unable to reach the customer, but I am trying to figure out how to reduce all the \"time inefficiencies.\" \n\nSo, what would a good, clear, professional, short(!) message be for a customer who has just placed (or is just about to finish placing) their order on a website? \n\nHow to say \"For fucks' sake: don't waste our delivery drivers time! Have your shit together, come to the door promptly, make sure you didn't fuck up your own address, turn your ringer on and answer your gawddamn phone.\" like corporate would? Probably with fewer curse words, for a start? :)\n\nThought this might be a fun discussion!\n\nCustomers who lurk here especially welcome to advise on what they would think might work or would like to see!\n\n\n\n",

There's people with invisible addresses, people who don't turn their porch lights on, various apartment complexes..\n\nLast night I had one that damn near drove me crazy.. So the city I'm delivering in has a numbered grid system.. All the address numbers coincide with the nearby cross street.. So if you're on say, 170 St and the most recent cross street is 60 Ave, all addresses on that block will be 60__.\n\nFor the sake of customer privacy, though I've not named the city I'll change the numbers for this story.\n\nWe have a pretty decent rush going, so I take 2 deliveries, one is really close tp the restaurant so I think to myself this one will be easy its super close.. Was I ever wrong about that.. \"4530 102 St #127: Back door\" I was thinking townhomes or a subdivision based on that instruction but as I'm coming down 102 and pass 45 Ave I dont see the number yet. I cross a named street (streets that don't conform to the grid, diagonal or curvy are named rather than numbered and do not change the block number)\n\nI couldn't see the number anywhere and I finally figured out where it was, a huge tree branch blocked the address.. It was an apartment with two doors, however there was no indication whatsoever that you could go around to the back door.. Right next door was the subdivision which is fenced off from the apartment, after many u turns and observation I found a driveway (the only driveway, the \"front\" had street parking only) around the other side on the NAMED street.. Thanks a lot you braindead city planners.. If you're going to make the only driveway on ******* Crescent, try making the address there rather than assigning the address to a pedestrian only entrance.. ESPECIALLY in a city designed more for vehicle traffic rather than pedestrian traffic.\n\n/end rant\n\nTl;Dr. Building address did not coincide with actual entrance.",

This leaves me, and my buddy as the only drivers. We're fucking slammed, taking 5 deliveries at once, phones beeping, managers screaming at cooks and everybody, you get the picture. I'm off on another run with a metric fuckload of pizza in my back seats. One of my slips is to the resident asshole customer of our store, so of course I take it last. This dude always gives drivers a literal fucking penny and acts all snarky. I pull up to his McMansion and grab his bag with 3 pizzas and a 2 liter. Knock on the door, nothing. Knock again, a minute later he casually opens the door in a fancy bathrobe with a smug look on his face. \"Good evening sir, your total is going to be ___\". As I expected, he opens his stuffed fucking wallet with a few hundreds in there, casually shifting through to find the exact dollar amount. He then says \"one moment\" and goes back to bring his fucking change jar back to count out exact change, and of course, he gives me one penny on top and says \"there you go, I'm sure it will help\". I'm already fucking pissed off and stressed from how busy we were and that I had to deliver to this guy, so I just completely blew my lid. I chucked the pizza boxes through his fucking door and took the change he gave me out of my pocket and tossed it at him yelling some expletives. I walk back to my car and he yells some shit about calling corporate as I slam my car door shut and drive back. Of course I got fired, but it was worth it, I'm tired of dealing with stupid fucknuts like this. ",

Everyone loves to joke around and have fun and of course we all work hard as well. People are always laughing and the customers are nice as heck too. Hell even when they somehow get a slice of pizza missing from their pizza they act pretty cool about it. \n\nMy boss is also super freaking cool. The dude thinks wayyyyy too highly of me and is already getting me ready to be a shift lead. He also treats all of his employees so well. Only manager I've seen that would act just like your best friend would. And of course he's harsh when applicable and disciplines workers so don't go off saying he's soft. \n\nI've been with Pizza Hut for almost three months now and I'm so glad I finally have a job that I don't completely dread showing up for. Although that might actually be because we're not a busy store so things are super slow ( today we only had like 90 tickets! Our store in Caldwell has twice that by 6 usually).\n\n\nI hope other people out there have Hut as great as mine is. Sorry for the rant but I really fucking love my job for once and ended to tell somebody.",

        "text": "Hi everyone!  It's been over 20+ years since I've quit delivering pizza, but I had some good experiences I'll share as I can remember them. I used to work at Round Table Pizza (a West coast chain) in Northern California as a delivery driver and shift supervisor. \n\nThis story is about the worst day I ever had on the road.  At the time I was driving a 1974 Mercury Cougar XR7, your basic big ass tuna boat. Now keep in mind this was before the days of cell phones, just pagers.  Cells were around, but only the well to do had them.  \n\nI was on the way to the Solar System with a pair of deliveries (the name for a subdivision where the names of the streets were all astronomy related), when all of a sudden I heard a loud bang and lost steering, as in it took all my strength to turn the steering wheel. Smoke started pouring out from under the hood and I could barely see. Well, I managed to get myself to a gas station and got to a pay phone to call my shop.  They had another driver come get my pizzas and take them (which sucked, because where they were going were guaranteed $ 5 - 10 tips each - again, this was around 1994-95, so 5 bucks was more than my hourly wage).  Thank goodness I had a nice manager.  I had to go off the clock and start my repair.  As it turned out, the power steering pump return line had blown a hole in the line, thus dumping all of the fluid all over the engine block, making the smoke.  I had to walk to Napa Auto (the closest auto parts store - about 3 miles away) to get a replacement hose, walk back, replace the hose, refill the system, and get the car going again, all while still wearing my uniform and somehow managed not to get it dirty.  It took about a total of 3 hours with all the walking and repairs, and somehow I was still able to get back onto the clock and complete my shift.\n\nNot a terribly exciting first story, but it still sucked big time.\n",

And as I go there, it already sucks since it is super far from theatre so my delivery times get fucked. Anyway so I get there and wait. I do my first knock and I hear movement. Which is a good sign, I should be all good to go! Just wait for them to do what they can to get ready and open the door! Because of this, I wait a little longer before knocking again. This time, it hear giggling. It's the worst thing you can hear anywhere, not just for a delivery, but anywhere in life. So I obviously see that they're home, and for some reason not door because god knows why. So I figure that I'm not going to call and just leave. Of course, wouldn't you know it? The second I reach my car, some little ass kids run out screaming \"wait wait!!!\"\n\nHell is on earth\n\nSo I've now been here about 5 minutes as they finally go and get the pizza. I'm visibly annoyed. Their reasoning s \"oh the wreath on our door blocks the view\" (it's like March or April at this time)\n\nFine. Go sign the fucking thing. I give them the receipt and pen and kind of just stare at them with a look of. . . Not a scowl, but a look of \"you're fucking wasting my time\"\n\nI guess they decided that right around then was a good time to bust a nut or something because it turns out that it took a another 5 minutes for them to sign the damn thing. There was a mom there who eventually came out and signed for it, but still, what the fuck?! This mom handed me the card and I think I got like a $3 tip idk. Whatever, it's a 10 min drive back to the store, I'm fucked anyway. \n\nWhat the fuck was their goal? Even as she was giving me the thing the kids were like \"you should have seen the look on the pizza guys face!!\" And shit like that.\n\nI go back to the store and tell the shift manager, and he's just like\n\n\"Yeah I think I delivered there before. The kids just laughed at the door and would run out later to waste your time. But when I delivered there I just drove off when they ran outside. Their parents called back and after I explained the situation she apologized and we brought it back\"\n\nWhich just kinda made it funny but also worse! How the fuck do the parents allow their kids to do this shit twice! And she was there! There's no excuse!\n\nSome peoples kids, man. . .",

The receipt said 1900 X# apartment. 1900 is the office building, which usually happens when people order online from apartments. I called to see what the BUILDING number was and asked him to go look in the middle of the building, because there's no way it's 1900 if the apartment number is X#. I even explained that the apartment buildings start at 1901, but the kid insisted it was 1900. I repeated that's not possible and asked how to get to him. He said oh just take 2 lefts and a right and I'll be outside. I tediously followed the microscopic apartment number signs (which led me to a completely different direction than what he said). I was expecting a light on or someone outside, but the apartment had no porch light on, and he wasn't outside. (It took me maybe a minute after the phone call to find the place). I knocked on the door and when he answered and he goes \"What took you so long I told you where I was\" WEW BOY. I calmly said yeah see the number on the building? That's 1938, not 1900. Then his dad walked out of his room and told me to come inside and \"get out of that fuckin rain young man\", I said nah it's fine I've been in it all day. He then told his son \"you better tip this man for that.\" Guess what. Kid's bill was 27 and change, handed me 30, and asked for the EXACT change back. Told him sorry bro I don't carry coins. Got a 9 cent tip ;) I wish I had the father's number. If my dad knew I did that I'd get an ass whooping from here to there.",

The thing is, these encounters are typically few and far between, so I've never been all that bothered by it.\n\nUntil now.\n\nI don't know why, but in the last two or three weeks I have delivered to children four times. And when I say children, I mean LITERAL children. Like, 8-12 years old, apparently home alone and with access to a credit card. I have no idea why this is suddenly a thing (and I would love to ask questions about why elementary school kids are being left unattended, but that's another topic). I'd contribute it to summer vacation having just started, but in my three years of delivering this is a first.\n\nBut yeah, of those four child customers, only one of them gave something even resembling a decent tip. With the others, I was lucky to get 25 cents. If this is going to be a thing now, so be it. But, on behalf of delivery drivers everywhere, I ask any parents reading this: \n\nIf you're going to let your children order for delivery, please teach them what a tip is. I'm not asking they even tip WELL, but believe me, when we drive to the edge of our sectors only to be greeted by a ten year old, we'd rather drive away with an extra buck or two instead of nothing at all.",

Granted, I PREFER being tipped, but I'm not going to like bust a nut on their pizza because I didn't get tipped. It bothers me to get stiffed but meh. . .\n\nWhat BOTHERS me though is when people obviously live in nice homes, and have money, and DO decide \"Let me tip\" but decide to be cunts about it. It's even worse than being stiffed, because at least you can think \"oh maybe they forgot\"\n\nSo I'm going on a month long vacation this month, and I was working my last day until July. It's been an okay day, but the kicker is on one of my later deliveries. I pull up to a decent looking house with a decent looking order (I think 2 pizzas? I honestly don't remember). It's a cash order too, which is a danger zone. I'm either going to get a pretty good cash tip that is distinctly separated from the cash, I'm going to be able to have them round up to $25 and they're like \"keep the change\", I'm gonna get like a 15 cent tip to round up to the next dollar, or I'm gonna get exact change.\n\nToday was none of those.\n\nThis kinda Urkel kid walks up to the door and gets the pizza. He's pretty friendly, I guess, but not in the \"Oh how sweet\" kind of friendly but more in the \"Friendly dorky kid that would probably spend 40 minutes to you talking about Hearthstone in great detail even though you have no idea what it's about.\"\n\nSo I give him his order and I'm like \"yea so that's $21.40\"\n\nHe smiles and hands me the change and says \"Allright! Here's 21 dollars, and here's 50 cents! You can keep the change as your tip!\"\n\nBesides the Little Caesar's story I posted, this is the only time where I've really \"broken character\" in front of a customer. I'm not entirely sure to describe the sound that I made, but imagine it like someone's voice cracking while doing a scooby doo impression. But I'm just like \"O-Oh b-BOY, T-THANK YOU!\" and was on my way.\n\nLike fuck man just stiff me lmao don't make me feel like shit lmao. Probably thought his bitch ass was being generous too.\n\nLike if it were a carry-out order like yeah okay cool thanks, I don't think any cashier would give a shit, but it would help with our cash count if some change went missing or whatnot.\n\nLuckily this is the only time where someone had verbally made me aware that they were giving me a shitty tip (but I've had plenty of tips under a dollar too so)\n\nhelp",

First off, I figured it was a little odd that I'd get a phone call asking about this (seeing as, if we did have a \"hot and ready\" area, it could change from the driver over). But I told her we don't causing her to simply give an annoyed sigh and hang up.

My manager is making me clean so I run to the phone to get a break. Same woman again, only this time she seems to be more cooperative. She asks me how long it would take to make a pizza, so I give her our 15 minute wait time. I figure she either didn't want to drive down to Little Caesars (which is in our delivery area so it's not TOO far), or someone really wanted Pizza Hut but with Little Caesar rules. She asks me how much one large pizza would be. I tell her about our $10 deal.\n\n\"But Little Caesars sells them for $7\"\n\nWell damn get some Little Ceasars then lmao. I'm not entirely sure what she thought she was going to get out of that. Maybe she figured we had some \"Price Match Garuntee\"\n\nLike \"oh golly miss, you're correct! I'll go ahead and adjust that price for you!\"\n\nBeing insanely nice on the phone, I just kind of went \"Y. . . Yup.\", causing her to just hang up.\n\nwhy do people do this\n\nyou're not even home\n\nIf you just make the phone call before you get ready to leave, it'll PROBABLY be ready by the time you get here. \n\nLike Little Caesar's is doing the lord's work in cheap ass pizza but still please don't assume that every store is like that.",

I forgot their soda with the order..'. \n\nFor example, here's my story.\nI was delivering one very rainy, night and had so many deliveries (only driver for the night) at once that I had'm stacked in my front seat and not in the warming bags. Well the short story is that without the bags to also keep the boxes dry, a few orders were crushed under the weight of other orders due to the boxes being soaked. Not only did I get drenched making the original deliveries but also had to go back shortly later and deliver a few again due to the pizza being a mess. Then I had to stand there (still pouring rain) and count out the refund of the full amount.\nIt was the worst night of my life as a delivery person.",

        "text": "I am a delivery driver but this is also more widely related to driving in general. One of my biggest pet peeve out on the road is about not using something that comes standard on every vehicle out on the road, requires the smallest effort to use and I have yet to see someone pulled over for, ever: blinkers/indicators/turn signals.\n\nAll day, every day. \n\nIt's not like I'm out on a casual ride and I get to choose where I have to go. Sure I can adjust the chosen road to get to my destination to a point but at the end of the day I have many different addresses to get to, preferably faster than not, and I have to deal with so many inconsiderate self absorbed drivers that it just gets to me and I end up saying out loud, in the car, by myself the quote I used as a title.\n\nMy \"favorite\" is coming out of the place's parking lot where most of my outings have me make a left onto the street out front. Across the street, diagonally to the left, is one of those coffee shops, the largest chain in Canada. Most of its traffic comes there from my left as I wait to enter traffic. Way too often I sit there waiting for a car to cross in front of me as they don't have a turn signal on only to see them make a left into the coffee shop's parking lot/drive through lane without ever using the turn signal which would allow me to make my left and enter traffic safely while they make their own and go about their business of filling their caffeine addiction.\n\nAnd I don't need to tell you about all the lane changes and other situations where indicators should be used and are not. We've all seen it time and again.\n\nPeople who don't use turn signals are just assholes the way I see it. It requires too little effort to be dismissed as anything else of a reason not to be predictable out on the road, help out other drivers and road users and just be safer.\n\nThoughts, comments ? \n\nThanks for reading.\n\ntl;dr: title.",

There's 3 sides and 3 floors of each building so you basically have to walk up and down each one trying to figure out where your room in this shitty ass layout is. Like floor 1 would be 1000, floor 2 would be 1400, shit make NO sense. So anyway this complex has 0 parking spots available ever, and the only places you can park are in front of garages. 99% of the garages never have cars in front of them so I didn't think it was in issue to park there instead of walking a mile. I walked up and down 9 flights of stairs because the numbering of this place makes 0 sense at all. (no tip on a $55 order btw.)\n\nWhen I got back to my car I saw some biker lady trying to fucking break into my car, I said \"HEEEY I'm a pizza guy, sorry if I took your spot, I didn't know anyone needed this spot!\" in a friendly tone. She started screaming at me for being an asshole, I can't park there, don't ever do that again, etc. Her boyfriend or husband or baby daddy or whatever got off his bike and started talking shit too. At this point I was ready to throw hands. But I explained again that I was a pizza guy and that's why I took their spot. He actually felt bad, apologized and actually sounded sad and threw me a $20. This was the weirdest delivery of my life. Had about a 20 minute conversation about him and his life. Shit was weird.",

        "text": "These are all from this past winter, if you didn't know then this year the NE and Midwest got a horrible winter between melting and freezing and horrible snow, sleet, and ice storms. I deliver in a VERY rural area with the store being in a ~2000 town but I am from the ~800 person town that is within range. So there is an intersection of two state highways (not freeways) in the 2000 town and one of those in the 800. All other roads are just your 55 or in town 25 roads. Didn't get as bad here but that also mean't we had to deliver and sorry to those in the NE that did during these storms. Also sorry for the long read as I didn't want to spam the page so if a certain story looks good below just \n\n**Summaries**\n\n1) Someone angry with us taking long in a snowstorm when only two drivers are available AFTER telling them it would be over an hour and we couldn't promise a time.\n\n2) Someone angry with us for not delivering that far during a sleet storm.\n\n3) A steep driveway\n\n4) The unmarked house with 6 in. of snow on the ground.\n\n**Actual** **Stories**\n\n1) It was snowing very heavily and being Wed. we only have two drivers and the Manager. We have no luck contacting any other staff as they are 45 - 1hr away during excellent weather and we would be short staffed anyways due to the staffing at the time. Due to the storm we get hit hard and we are telling customers over an hour. After 1 hr I get a call from one of the people and I tell them it is coming out now and should be there within 30min-1hr. They huff and whatnot then hangup. The driver turns onto their street ~30min later and cancels. Sure enough they leave a fun [review](http://i.imgur.com/QPKvuJ1.jpg) (Name blocked out obviously and sorry for potato edit) I could understand if not for the storm and the fact that 1hr 30min or even 2hr is more than 1hr.\n\n2) It was sleeting and roads were so slick that we reduced range to 2 miles with orders from the owner. The trailer park 5 miles away calls and my manager answers to get passed to the entire household to be yelled at for not risking the other driver and I's lives. Bless that storm as they never tip anyways.\n\n3) There is a house on a private drive where about 1000 ft. from the house there is a dip with ~30 - 35 degree slope above a creek. Considering it had melted then frozen with some powdery snow and blowing frigid I had come prepared to get stuck with high grip insulated snow boots, a trapper hat, mask, and gloves. Not wanting to get stuck in that I gear up and shield the bag and walk it. They said they could drive me back down or call me next time I decline the drive as I slid on the way there and didn't want them to get stuck or hit my car. I made it back but man was that cold and I was surprised the pizza stay hot when I checked it at the porch.\n\n4) Another storm with heavy snowfall we had 4 inches on the road as the plows couldn't keep up with 6 on the ground and increasing at a rapid pace. Visibility is also very low and it is night. I am delivering to a close place however I cannot see the driveway and just start binary guessing. First stop led me down to a service drive to a pole as I was thinking perhaps a long driveway. Was able to just turn around with tires spinning and get out. Second guess was an ATV trail and was unable to turn around so fortunately one side gets traction flipping me around and I am able to floor in 2nd out of there. Finally they answer the phone and they have no driveway, just a field with no mailbox with a trailer and car... At least they tipped decent.\n\nOn the bright side deliveries are more frequent with better tips on non-holidays during the winter. ",

        "text": "The setting: I'm delivering to an apartment building that has parking only on the far end from the side I need to go to. BUT, there's a strip of concrete that is perfectly sized for a car that goes down to the other side of the building, lined with 'no parking' signs and a handicap parking sign at the end. \n\nNaturally, I drove straight to the end of the concrete strip, threw it in park, and hopped out quickly. Just one pizza, no drinks, no credit receipt, no nothing else. I knew exactly where I was going, I had had to call for the apartment number before I left the store so she was expecting me:, honestly the most quick-and-easy, clear-cut delivery possible. \n\nAs soon as I was out of my car, I heard some old dude behind me: \"Ah he's from Florida, must not be able to fucking read.\" (Sidenote: I have out-of-state plates). \n\n*And you must not be able to fucking see,* I thought, but said nothing as I jogged into the building. I knocked; she answered immediately. She handed me what she said was $20 but was really $19 (the difference between a $1 tip and a stiff), I handed her the pizza and I was jogging back to my car with a pizza bag under my arm. Didn't even count the money, which I normally would've, because I just knew Mr. Parking Police was waiting. \n\nAnd waiting he was. I saw an old guy standing next to my car with his phone out to dial. Before he could say anything, I said what I have always wanted to say in a situation like this:\n\n\"Yes sir, I can read. Call a tow truck.\" \n\nI then jumped in my car, threw it in reverse, and zipped off. \n\nOh, but the story doesn't end there. He called to complain. I love when people call to complain about my driving. I have laughed in the face of managers who have told me about it. I think it's hilarious. Apparently, the guy said, \"He's lucky he's so fast or I would've broken his jaw,\" along with saying he was a disabled vet about half a dozen times. So apparently parking in a no parking zone is punishable by breaking people's jaws? \n\nWatch out, fellow drivers. You've been warned. ",

This incident happened last night, but I wasn't able to post it since I fell asleep.  \n\nI was going on a standard delivery to this one house. It was a clear night, barely anyone on the roads. All in all, a relaxing drive there. I didn't recognize the address that I was going to until I pulled up on the house. It was *that* house. The last time I had delivered a pizza to that house, there was a kid that was pointing a laser pointer in my eyes as I walked up to the front door. After I knocked on it, he took forever to come down the stairs, too. The mother opened the door and told me to wait as she shouted for him. It was some fifteen year old high school kid. By the way he was acting with the laser pointer, I assumed he would be nine, but no. I read him the total, and he handed me a wad of cash. The mother looked at him and asked, \"Does that include the tip?\" He said, \"Yeah,\" and took his pizzas out of my hands and ran upstairs. As I got back to the car, he started to shine the laser pointer in my eyes again as I started to count the wad that he had given. Technically, he did include the tip into the wad of cash; a whole two cents.\n\nThis last encounter flashed through my mind as I put my car in park and got out. *Well, at least there's no laser pointer tonight,* I thought. I walked up to the front door again and knocked. The mother opened the door again and called for the kid. He came down the stairs and I read him the total - $19.98. He gave me a single $20 bill, grabbed his pizzas and closed the door. I started on down the drive way when I heard the front door open again and a female voice shout \"Pizza guy! Come back here!\"  \n\nI immediately tensed and ran over the itemized list in my mind. *Oh, crap. Did I forget a two liter or something? I don't remember there being a drink on the order...* I turned around, puckering my butthole as I walked back towards the door expecting a reaming for something that I thought that I had forgotten. As I got to the door the mother was there. She looked at me and said, \"How much did he give you?\"  \n\"Uh... $20.\"  \n\"How much was the order?\"  \n\"$19.98.\"  \n\"That's what I thought.\" She yelled upstairs for the kid to come down and to wait at the door. She went back into the house for a minute and came back. She looked at her son with one of those \"you're in deep trouble\" mom looks and asked him, \"Why didn't you give him a tip?\"  \n\"Uh... I did.\"  \n\"Two cents? That's not a tip. I told you to give him five. Why didn't you give him a tip?\" The kid just darted his eyes between me and his mother. \"Apologize to him.

Didn't tip the second time and his mom called me back to the door. Dressed down her kid right before my eyes and handed me a $10 tip to make up for the last time. ",

        "text": "Prefacing this: If you order a pizza and then bitch about the price when I'm standing in front of your fucking door rather than when you order it, please stop.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to order one pizza for delivery, do not. If you do, do the $7.99 deal online. I can't tell you how many people will spend $20 on just one pepperoni pizza. It physically hurts me inside (especially because usually they're shitty tippers too)\n\nSo I'm taking a delivery. It's a pretty okay Wednesday afternoon, still tired since I had to open, but meh. I take a single pizza delivery to a house that's really not that far (Technically maybe 2 streets away but there's a busy intersection so it's not always such a quick delivery). It's some really weird ass pizza, like half supreme, half cheese.\n\nI get to the house and I get out of the car. Luckily, the woman was already standing outside, which USUALLY is a good sign. I don't have to wait, I can just hang out by my car and do everything super quick, pop back to the store and. . . idk make some boxes or something, it's wednesday (my dudes).\n\nSo she's like \"ARE YOU THE PIZZA GUY\" and me, being in my full pizza hut uniform carrying a pizza bag, reply \"yup\"\n\nSo she walks towards the door, when she starts aggressively pounding on the door. Like, I figured she was trying to break it or something. At this point all I could just do was stand and stare. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on, if she was like locked out of her house or what. I thought later that maybe she was trying to get me in trouble by having her husband open the door and being like \"your driver knocked very aggreesively and rudely please give us free pizza\". But eventually two kids opened the door after like 3 minutes.\n\nThat was weird, but I gave her the pizza. Immediately she asks for the total, and I tell her (its' like $18.35 idk). Immediately she's like \"why would you pay that much for a pizza\"\n\nMentally I'm like \"fuck idk maybe you should have thought about that before buying it.\" but I'm just like \"ya uh sorry that's the price. We even applied this coupon to bring it down.\" So she kinda goes off about that for a bit but she eventually is like \"whatever\"\n\nThe kid hands me the wad of cash, but the mom immediately snatches it. She then proceeds to count every single bill, straighten it out, and put it in my hand. I'm not entirely sure why, because honestly I just eyeball it and as long as it looks fine it doesn't matter, nor do I care if the bills are given to me in a giant crumple. But she did, and I started getting a little antsy because I just wanted to leave. And she gives me exact change because god is dead, and I'm on my merry way. . . somewhat. \n\nI'm sitting in my car, and I hear \"EXCUSE ME SIR!\" I figure maybe she's gonna ask for cheese and peppers or something, so I roll down my window and ask her what's up.\n\n\"This is not a large pizza\"\n\nI'm dumbfounded. Never before in my life did I think I would be confronted with this question. Especially considering I cut this pizza, I knew that this was a large pizza. Usually, I have answers for stuff like this, but for this, I was just lost.\n\nSo I get out of the car, and she tells her kids to give me the pizza.\n\nI look at it\n\nIt's in a large box\n\nIt's a fucking large pizza\n\nI had to go into the details of \"yeah our large is 14 inches and this is the 14 inch pizza so yeah\" but she wasn't having it. She was like \"I paid $18 for this pizza and I deserve to get a large pizza, bring this back and give me a large pizza\"\n\nSo, me being me, I gave her her money back and I'm like \"I'll see what I can do but I'll call you when I'm back at the store, and I'll give you the money back just in case you wanna cancel it.\" For some reason she claimed she gave me $18.50 but fuck i didn't give a shit lmao.\n\nSo I get back to the store, and I am laughing. Actually laughing, wheezing as I have to tell my manager that this large pizza is not a large pizza.\n\nHe's just like \"what the fuck\" and is pretty much like \"yeah call them and tell them that this is a large\". Of course they don't fucking pick up because that would make things too easy. So I have to drive back out there and explain the situation to them.\n\nGranted, one of the older drivers was like \"yo man space out the pizza so it looks bigger\" and I shit you not I have never seen a man craft a pizza with so much tender care as I have with that man fixing up that pizza.\"\n\nSo I drove back, and in classic \"person that gets angry at me\" fashion, she just kinda gives me the money and doesn't say anything.\n\nTechnically, since she gave me back the two quarters I gave her, I made myself a 15 cent tip. Woohoo.\n\nI'm tempted to carry a ruler in my car now so I can be like \"that's 14 inches bitch\"",

One of the managers said that I was going to get an extra dollar an hour for my training inside. Well he said he was going to take care of that and time went on and it never happened. I ended up going to the owner about it and he said that he knew nothing and that I should talk to that manager because he does payroll anyway. Well I mentioned it and he said he would get around to it. Well around Christmas my friend was told he'd get a dollar raise and so would I. Well here recently I was able to see a form that showed our pays when a manager left the computer on and saw that I didn't get the raise and my friend only got half he was promised. The issue is that we only just found out because our job doesn't make it easy for us to view our pay stubs but requires us to use direct deposit. Any advice?",

You can turn on do not disturb mode on among other things.\n\nPs: If you have an out of area number you can get an in-area number so customers are more likely to pixk up",

I surveyed my options as it rang. I had my money on the hair salon. Usually it's good to deliver to salons or barber shops. After a few rings:\n\n\"Thanks for calling Cricket Wireless, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Thanks, that actually answers my question. I'll be right there.\" I hung up. \n\nA few moments later, I walked into an empty Cricket store. The head of a black female twenty-something peeked out the back, terrified for a split second, then she burst out laughing. She looked back into what I assume was their stock room and said, \"it's the pizza guy\" (still laughing). \n\nI was also laughing at that point; so was the girl in the back. We laughed the entire time I was in the store. We all laughed as I handed her the clipboard and she signed over a $3 tip. We all laughed as I walked out.\n\nMoral of the story, give your whole address :P",

Once in advance because of a hospital appointment, and the other two because my bikes back wheel literally came off and I had to get it repaired and call out \n\nNow, the first shift back I get ready for work, and I notice a little headset icon in my top screen. I think nothing of it abd start my shift.\n\n3rd delivery of the night and I'm making good time. The directions are a little vague but I think I find the place, the app confirms this for me - a university hall, sixth floor.\n\nI arrive and tell the app so. All I have to do now is hand the order over and swipe \"delivered\" and I can continue.\nBit I get no answer. Nothing on the doorbell, nothing by knocking.\n\nI call up the customer, they pick up and I get no answer. I call rider support and receive the same thing.\n\nI figure out after some messing around that my phone still thinks a headset is plugged into it, and is trying to direct audio through non-existant input and outputs. They cants hear me and I can't hear them.\n\nI spend some time trying to text the customer instead. No response.\n\nI look back at the app to check again that I'm in the right place. It's been 15 minutes. But, somehow, the \"delivered\" button is already checked and its buzzing angrily at me to move into the next order.\n\nI try calling anf texting over and over trying to figure out what's happening.\n\nDeliveroo starts calling me. They must have received a complaint.\nI'm getting calls from other numbers too, doesn't appear to be the customer, but I don't know. It's been 25 minutes.\n\nI panic. I text my boyfriend and I'm relieved when he replies back. He tries calling the customer for me, but gets no answer.\nHe calls rider support and speaks to then for me. Keeps me updated. It's been 50 minutes by the time they hang up to call the customer.\n\nIm panicking. The app keeps removing me for inactivity, and I'm pretty sure that counts as me removing myself from the shift. Which meand I don't get paid.\n\nI can't just leave the order here. I can't just take it with me and complete orders- it takes up most of the bag!\nIt's been an hour and a half by the time I post this- it's helping me keep calm but in pretty sure I'm going to get fired or something.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, looking at my file, I imagine someone seeing more shifts 'skipped' than completed, who's just grabbed food and ran with it, quitting the end of her shift. Im pretty sure I'm not getting paid, and I wouldn't be surprised if they fired me. \n\nI've been crying in the hall, it's been well over an hour and a half. My shift is going to be over soon if it technically isn't already.\n\nI don't know what to do. This is a disaster and I'd love some support.",
