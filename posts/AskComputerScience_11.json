I'm taking Physics (lecture +lab), Calculus II, and Data Structures altogether this semester. I've never been particularly good at math and these classes seem really intimidating. Does anyone have any tips that would help me pull through this semester? I've been in community college way too fucking long, and these courses (plus a couple more major prep classes) are the only things left for me to get my AS-T to transfer.\n\nI'm on a waitlist for a Discrete Mathematics class as well, and would end up dropping Data Structures to take it instead - as it meshes with my class schedule a little better. If I got into that class, would it be easier to take it simultaneously with the other courses listed above over Data Structures, or vice versa? I have to complete both courses either way.\n\nThanks in advance",

Do they actually get compressed, get left unchanged, only compress when you have multiple of the same type of file in the folder?

(K is the standard box modality) Shouldn't it be O(||M||^2 x |φ|) instead of O(||M|| x |φ|)?  For instance, consider the formula KKp.  Its subformulas are p, Kp, and  KKp.  It takes O(||M||) time to label each state either p or ~p (given that you can label an individual state in constant time). It takes O(||M||) time to label a single state with Kp or ~Kp, since in the worst case you have to look at every state in M (I take this to be what the last sentence of the proof is saying).  But  you must do this for *every* state in M, and so labeling each state with Kp or ~Kp takes O(||M^2 ||). \n\nIn other words, the worst case is checking a formula like K...KKp--for each modal depth, for every state you must possibly check every other state. Hence O(||M||^2 x |φ|).\n\nWhere is my reasoning going wrong?  Or is this not the algorithm the proof is sketching? ",

From what I have seen so far, you are only able to scrape what said person has posted; for example, if someone had tweeted an email address 3 years ago, you are able to scrape everything containing \"gmail\" on said person's twitter. I know it is used as a way to save time rather than going through to look for all the information you want yourself or getting other people to do it.\n\nI was wondering if you are able to scrape the emails used to make the accounts rather than emails stored in bio's or that have been tweeted out. I know when you enter someone's username and click forgot password it gives you a starred out email, but I am not sure you'd be able to scrape the whole thing. Is this possible?\n\nMany thanks",

        "text": "I'm a intermediate level coder with some experience in Linux but no experience in cloud. I need to deploy a private cloud in my server and for that I searched and found openstack.** I tried to install it on a virtual box with 2gb ram, i5 processor, 50gb hdd, Ubuntu 18.04 using conjure-up but it stuck on \"waiting for the services to settle\" for like almost 3hrs**. When I read the docs to install it I couldn't understand them. I looked for tutorials but couldn't find any. I have a few questions regarding them.\n\n1. Is there any other way to implement private cloud on a server?\n\n2. What are the minimum requirements for running a test openstack deployment within my system for testing?\n\n3. Where can I find a good tutorial for deploying it?",

I would like to write a programm that removes the greenscreen/makes the green pixels transparent. Although the photos are well-lit, some green bleeding occurs, meaning that some green is reflected by the actual object in the photo (only close to the edge of the object and the greenscreen). \nThe program should be able to not only remove the greenscreen but also to \"fix\" the edges without removing parts of the image itself.\n\nAfter some research I found that there are many libs/frameworks that could be useful to achieve this like e.g.: openCV, marvinproject, imagemagick. \n\nI am not hestiant to learn something new but before I start I would like a recommendation / pointers which technology to use / where to start.\n\n(I work as a softare engineer but only have little experience in computer vision)\n\nI am grateful for any input :)",
