Almost all of the praise for black culture such as these historical comparison compliments come off so boring &amp; unenthusiastic. and character development is too comonly handled by announcements in conversation. all the black people I've ever met never had a robotic delivery during conversation. when there are action scenes, the acting comes off natural. but when there's dialogue too often is it simply expositional and feels like a dump of informaion. the character's convo's are on like \"ready, set, speak\" mode. there's very littl authentic consciousness or reaction to speech at times. human beings do not communicate like such. there are occassions, often with Will &amp; Carlton or Jazz where the dialogue feels real and is extremely charasmatic. i just wish, they could take a 2nd edit on their dialogue to make come off more naturally spoken.

I loved most of the plot lines, characters, etc. it was awesome.\n\nBut I swear to god, ever since Twyin died, the show just seems so lost. \n\nSeason 5 was terrible and boring. The only highlight of that season was Jon snows arch. Everything else was awful. Aryas sub plot sucked and was so boring. Kings landing felt boring with this cult running things. Sansa and the Boltons lasted way too long and was so boring. \n\nThe worst part was the anti climactic stupid Stannis Baratheon plot line. All of that buildup for the writers to just have lazy writing and have a lackluster final battle and have the weather be the biggest “hurdle” \n\nJon snow dies which sucks because he’s my favorite character, but then to be revived two episodes later. \n\nLike, it’s disappointing. And from what I’ve seen so far, it doesn’t get better. 7 and 8 are supposedly horrible. \n\nI know this sounds like a ranting post, but I’m just disappointed. Seasons 1-4 were so good. But to have this huge giant time commitment and then just the loss of quality is frustrating to say the least. \n\nShould I just finish season 6 and be done with the show?",

I have an interest in these shows but not a lot of time to watch everything. \n\nDo you think it would be enoigh to cherry pick the \"objectively good\" episodes by some guide or imdb ratings and just watch these + other important ones like character introduction episodes?

        "text": "Having finished House of the Dragon recently, I was in the mood for more of that kind of stuff. Going through my collection I came across the Blu Ray copy of S4 of GOT, which is the only GOT-related physical media I own. I'd never had the urge of watching it since the show ended but for some reason I thought why not just try it and see how well it has aged.\n\nSo I only watched GOT S4 this past week and that season of television is something else. Absolutely incredible from start to end. Of course that excellent buildup from the past 3 seasons helps but still S4 rises the highest among GOT seasons. Post S4 the writing starts to decline as the source material isn't either there or isn't followed too closely. And while seasons 1-3 are great in their own right, Seasons 1 and 2 have noticeably weak production design. \n\nSeason 3 is right next to S4 since both cover the best book of ASOIAF called Strom of Swords, but S4 just has much more drama. S4 is packed with tension, betrayals, unexpected deaths of heroes as well as villains, tragedy, love, battles, duels, courtroom drama, politics &amp; dying on the shitter.\n\nS4 is the season of the Lannisters who easily have the best actors and the most complex villains in Joffrey, Tywin &amp; Cersei. Tyrion gets our sympathy as he navigates a way out of the mess he gets into after the Purple Wedding with a fan favorite supporting act from Pedro pascal's Oberyn Martell. \n\nThe run of the final 5 episodes has banger after banger, each better than the last: The Laws of gods and men, Mockingbird, Mountain and the Viper, Watchers on the Wall &amp; The Children.\n\nThe Watchers on the Wall is the special episode of the season (EP 9) as it's all set in one location and features probably the most well thought out battle of the show. From Pyp and Grenn's emotional deaths, Sam showing character, Alisser Thorne being a hard badass, Ygritte's sad death to Jon Snow finally taking a long awaited charge and running the show, Watchers is a masterpiece.\n\nAdding very good production/set design, cinematography, score &amp; editing to the story, characters and acting, you get a stunning season of Television that can stand against the best of them imho.\n\n**My rating: 10/10**",

Crime is usually a darker version of a drama, whereas action often has thriller elements, depending on how strong the protagonist and antagonist are.\n\nRomance is also technically a subtype of drama, I think.

Is there something about our current era that's making people long for attach themselves to this type of storytelling? Pedro is also the perfect guy to lead those of those, he looks so much like an old school Western actor (and a lot like Burt Reynolds, who himself was a guy that would've been the #1 western actor a few decades earlier an ended up doing the same stories more in a car, but still did some horse westerns too I think)",

The season was bloated, too many boring episodes, and the good ones were only good. I watched all 20 odd episodes sustained by the concept alone. I really wanted \"more\" from the show, and there were so many hints that it was nearly there.\n\nThe first episode of the second season gave that. (It's the one where she impregnates that dude 💀) Extremely absurd. Very unsettling. Funny and gruesome and you can't help the schadenfreude. I thought, yeah, this is what the show needs to be, it needs to push the boundaries a lot more, it's what the concept deserves. I even thought because they had reduced the number of episodes that that meant the quality would be sustained.\n\nNot sure why that wasn't the case. Went downhill. So many boring episodes, and a pointless attempt at wider intrigue. Writers need to be more comfortable with letting a show just be episodic.\n\nI wonder if this is an unpopular opinion",
