        "text": "February 25. As I am writing this, the clock hitting 4 in the morning, I’m in bed next to my girlfriend at her house. She’s sleeping peacefully with her breathing almost unnoticeable. Me on the other side am trying my best to not shake out of fear and wake her up. It is unknown to me if my mind is playing me or if what I have noticed is real.  \n\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for more than a year and things between us have gone serious. We both think have found the one and engagement is on our path. For our anniversary which was a month ago I gave her a little mirror to keep it in her room as she hadn’t one and had to go to other rooms to do her make up. Two days ago we were hanging together like usual and went to her house to chill. We took a nap to recharge before hanging out with friends. When the time was due I got ready faster than her and sat next to her patiently watching her do the make up while chit-chatting.   \n\n\nNow I am a huge fan of scary stories and while believing into the paranormal it is my judgement that there is a veil separating our worlds. A veil which is not tress-passable unless we in this world try to (witchcraft, etc). So I don’t believe a demon, ghost or something else can disturb you if you don’t try to disturb them in the first place.   \n\n\nMoving on to our story. As we both were chit-chatting I noticed she kept the little mirror on the desk in front of her bed with the mirror facing and reflecting the bed. Jokingly I asked her in what position did she keep the mirror when she went to bed to sleep. She stopped blushing her cheeks and looking confused with a smile on her face she raised an eyebrow as to what did I mean with that question. Not letting me explain my joke she answered immediately after \"of course facing the other side of the room as to not have to do with demons.\" Laughing and glad she got my joke we moved on to other discussions until she got ready and we both went out.  \n\n\nLater that night when we got back and went to bed right before my sleep got me, I noticed the little mirror in the dark facing towards us. Although dark, I noticed it was facing us because on top of the bed there is a little blue light and that little blue light was being reflected on the mirror. Not making much of it I went to sleep.   \n\n\nNext morning my girlfriend had waken up before me and was busy making us breakfast when I woke up. The first thing I noticed after clearing my eyes and sight was the mirror in an angle facing the closet and not the bed. Instinctively i thought that is how it was last night to and being in that state half wake half asleep my mind saw it incorrectly. Nothing much happened that day until late that night. Along with friends we had decided beforehand to go clubbing. We were getting ready while the time was around eleven o’clock. As per usual I did get ready faster and sat next to her watching her doing the make up which had become a habit of mine.   \n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the time we were getting ready was around eleven, a time which on other plan-less nights would have found my girlfriend asleep. As I was watching her reflection on the mirror, I caught a glimpse of the reflection to its side of the bed with my girlfriend sleeping in it. Instinctively turned my look to see the bed which unsurprisingly was empty and turned again to see the bottom left of the mirror reflecting the bed which was again unsurprisingly empty. Not having the time to process what I saw, I raised my eyes to see the reflection of my girlfriend face and catching me off-guard she was staring at me while doing her eyeliner.  \n\n\nShe wasn’t giving me that confused stare as to question my sudden move (unconsciously while moving my look to the mirror-bed and then mirror again I moved my whole body. No, she was giving me that “I got you red-handed” stare. Smiling nervously I asked her what? She didn’t answer but continued to stare at me like that for a second then frowned at moved her eyes to meet her reflection and continued with her eyeliner.   \n\n\nAll this happened in the span of 5-10 seconds and all while not stopping doing the lines on her eye. I asked again what, she stopped moving the eyeliner and looked at me through the reflection of the mirror confused. \"You were staring at me\" I said to which she replied negatively while turning her body towards me with a playful ironical glance on her face, \"How could I've been doing the line so perfectly if I was staring at you instead?\" She was right as I do remember her not stopping the hand holding the brush.   \n\n\nConcluding that my mind did me a trick and I should stop reading much into paranormal stuff I didn't make much of what happened. Until that night while we were sleeping. Before we went to bed and turning off the lights I did take a last look at the mirror and it was facing the closet and went to sleep. Now, my girlfriend sleeps so peacefully, I notice it because almost every time it is me who goes to sleep last. She almost doesn't move at all, all night, except the times when she gets up to go to the bathroom or to drink water, and every time me waking up because of the moving.   \n\n\nI know it is her waking up to drink water because I can hear her drinking water, and I know it is her going to the bathroom because I hear the door opening and closing. That night after the strange event occurred, and that I did check and make sure the mirror was facing the closet, she did wake up and woke me up because of the moving. But like any other nights I didn't hear her drinking, nor did I hear the door being opened. I stretched my head to see what was she doing. Almost as she was sleep-walking she moved something on her desk, what it was I couldn't notice in the dark.   \n\n\nShe then turned to the bed and I could see she had her eyes opened although her movement and stare were like she was asleep. Shutting my eyes and pretending I was sleeping while she got into the bed again and proceeded to sleep again, I was praying she didn't noticed me following her movements. After some minutes I couldn't resist the temptation to find out what she had moved. I opened my eyes and to my astonishment I caught the reflection of the blue light that was on the top of the bed. She had moved the mirror so it could reflect the bed.  \n\n\nA chill went down my spine though I was more confused than scared. Thinking it is all a prank she's playing on me since I made that joke the other day I tried to go back to sleep. But I couldn't. I tried to get my head under the coverts but to no effect. The idea the mirror was facing us was making me nervous. So I got up and moved the angle of the mirror until the reflection of the blue light vanished.   \n\n\nWhen I turned back I saw my girlfriend had gotten up, half sitting in bed, watching me. I could notice or more I could feel, she didn't have that half asleep confused look, or that bothered look she would have given me for waking her up with my movements. She was giving me the exact stare she did through the mirror earlier that night. Just staring at me, not saying a word.   \n\n\nI smiled nervously and asked her \"what is wrong why are you not sleeping, honey?\" and took a step forward to the bed. At that moment I felt as if a hand grabbed my wrist. Terrified I turned back and saw nothing. No hand no other items that could have felt like grabbing me. I mean I was already shook by the sudden movement of my girlfriend and my mind could have easily make me see or feel every other illusion. One thing I couldn't get behind was that it felt like that hand had gotten out of the mirror.   \n\n\nWhen I turned back towards the bed right after I checked there was nothing there, I noticed my girlfriend was still sitting in that position, but now she was smiling. A very creepy smiling. As if she did know what was going through my mind and what had just happened. I was trying to gather my strength to ask her why was she smiling like that when she said \"You are bothering me\", and her smile vanished from her face. \"Bothering you?\" I replied \"with not letting you sleep by making noises with my movements?\" She didn't reply, instead sighed. I said \"right?\" as to confirm she meant that.   \n\n\nHer face featured than took a surprised look as to why was I standing there in the middle of the night. Not making much of it she said \"come to bed\", which I did eventually though I am terrified right now. I was scrolling through my phone to take my mind off of these events but to no avail. That is why I am on reddit right now documenting what had happened and will try to document future events, if any occur.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit. I want to apologise in advance, as I am an old fart who is bad with computers and my English is not that great. I used both Google Translate and some help of my grandson to write this text. From 1978-1987, I was the observer of the Nightcaller Unit, a secret unit of the fire department of the small village of Vijvergem, Belgium. Even though it was very scary and dangerous, it was probably the most fascinating job I have ever had in my life. And I want to share some stories about this job with you. I will first give you a little bit of a backstory. \n\nI grew up in Vijvergem, a little village near the city of Ypres, Belgium. Just like any other small village in Belgium, Vijvergem had brick houses, a church, some stores and a pub. As a kid, I loved growing up there. In the summer, my friends and I would play in the grain fields, steal corn cobs, dig in the earth for war relics or ride our bicycles to Ypres for ice cream. During the winter, the ponds would freeze over and turn into ice patches on which we ice skated. Vijvergem also has a fascinating history. It was founded in 1919 by Alfred Vandenvijver, a Belgian farmer who decided to build his new farm on top of a former WWI trench system after his old farm got bombed by the Germans. The fields surrounding his new farm turned out to be very fertile, which allowed the farm to bloom and grow into the lovely farming village that I know today. Vijvergem however has a dark tradition. It’s the reason why you can’t find it on any map. We call our tradition ‘Nachtroep’, roughly translated to English as ‘Nightcall’. \n\nWay back in the summer of 1919, when Alfred Vandenvijver first started building his new farm, he began to notice strange things happening around the farm. For example, every couple of days, he would find scorch marks in his grain fields. Sometimes, his cows would go missing, only to be found later that day in a tree or on the roof of one of his buildings. In very rare cases, he found his animals back dead. Apart from those strange occurrences, everything seemed normal in Vijvergem, until 6 June 1925. That is the day of the first attack.\n\nAround midnight, people started reporting strange noises, like growling, hissing and a faint whistling. Some people also noted feeling warm wind and smelling a burning smell. Suddenly, about two hours after the first reports, a human-like creature rose out of the murky water from one of the ponds. This creature, nicknamed ‘Groote Fritz’ (or ‘Big Fritz’ when roughly translated to English) by us, was first sighted that same night by Marie Vanacker and Jef Vandeschelde, a young couple who were abruptly disturbed during a naughty session. Jef, trying to defend Marie, unfortunately became the first of many victims that night. In total, Big Fritz took the lives of 13 people and laid 4 houses in ashes. \n\nThe description of Big Fritz given by Marie is still the most detailed we have to this day. She described him as a human-like creature, about 2 metres in height. His skin is as black as coal and has a ‘molten’ texture. His face, if he even has a face, is hidden by a WWI German gas mask. The filter of the gas mask is smudged with blood and dripping a murky type of slime. He wears a ring-shaped device on his back, which constantly releases a hissing noise. Later reports and observations confirmed this device is a Wechselapparat (or Wex), a WWI German flamethrower.\n\nBig Fritz would appear around once a week at night in an irregular pattern and often from a different pond. There are 12 ponds in total in Vijvergem, so it was very hard to predict from which pond Big Fritz would appear. Most of the time, Big Fritz would walk around aimlessly and do nothing. But, when he noticed a light, he would go towards it and look at it for hours. If there were people around, he would become angry and use the Wex to burn them to death. After 3-4 hours of walking around, he would go back to the pond he came from. \n\nAfter the third attack on 17 June 1925, Alfred Vandenvijver found the ‘Nachtroepers’ (or ‘Nightcaller Unit’ when roughly translated to English), a group of three firefighters whose job was to control both the creature and his destruction. The Unit consisted of three members: the observer, the warden and the extinguisher. The observer sat high in a watchtower. His job was to map out the path Big Fritz took every time he showed up. He also tallied how many houses he burned down. The warden went around and made sure everyone in the village was inside by 1 o’clock sharp. He also made sure all doors and windows of each house were locked and all lights were out, as any source of light attracted Big Fritz. After that, he drove around the village in a car and made sure all doors and windows were kept closed and all lights were kept out throughout the entire night. The extinguisher had probably the most dangerous job of the three. He first had to switch on a bright light in a field far away from the village. Next, he had to follow Big Fritz from a distance and try to extinguish any fires he started. Extinguishers got the highest pay, but often quit the job after only a couple of years, because they were either too traumatised, too wounded or dead.\n\nI myself was the observer of the Nightcaller Unit for 9 long years. I started in 1978, right after the big attack of the 12th of July. It was probably one of the worst attacks I have ever seen in my life. Somehow, Big Fritz managed to burn down the watch tower, which not only killed the observer, but also allowed the fire to spread towards the village. In total, 5 houses burned down and 8 people were killed, including all members of the Nightcaller Unit. The next day, three new Nightcallers were chosen. Me, being 18 years old and dumb, volunteered to become the observer.\n\nMy hands are getting tired from typing, but I would love to tell you some of my stories. I will try to type out a couple of them as soon as possible. Thank you for reading and understanding.",

        "text": "I was a process server in PG County, Maryland. I had to serve a subpoena to a car insurance agent, whose office was in this very old office building. Its surrounding area is what I called an \"empty shell of a suburbia'. It looked like a neigbhorhood from far away, but there's no neighbors since it never recovered from housing crisis way back. All the stores in the nearby plazas were closed down. There were barely any cars. The townhouses near by were probably all empty. \n\nThe building had no front desk and no security guard, only two elevators in the middle of a dirty blank wall.\n\nThe elevator was old, the kind that had a thick dark brown colored door that slide to one side instead of opening up in the middle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe numbers on the elevator buttons was the first red flag I ignored. There was no L for the lobby, only 2, 6, 10, 12, 16, and 20. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI figured it was one of those, “even number floors only” elevators (even though 4 and 8 were missing). And the other one was probably an “odd number floors\" only elevator.  I assumed 2 was the lobby, and I knew I had to go to the 6th floor, so I just told myself to not think too hard and pressed that button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ride felt a bit short for going up 6 floors, I thought to myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe elevator opened at one end of the corridor. It was very narrow. Two people would not be able to walk shoulder to shoulder. There was no window. All the doors to the offices are grayish brown. No noise seems to be coming out from any of them. It was so quiet I wanted to turn down my own heart beat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knocked on the door of the insurance agent’s office, and no one answered. Typical. The air was thick and the narrow corridor was suffocating. I hurried back to the elevator and pressed the arrow down button next to the elevator to get out of there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe elevator door opened. I went in and the numbers were all different. 3, 5, 11, 13, 17, and 21\n\nI was annoyed, this was probably the “odd number floors” only elevator. I pressed 3 because I wanted to go down. But nothing happened. It didn’t light up. I pressed again, no light. After the elevator doors closed, I was shocked that I was going up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was going up? Did someone call it up? Why did it open on my floor, since no one got out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt opened to the 13th floor. There was nothing there, just an open plan office that seemed to not have been used for years. Cobwebs and dust covered everything. Who called it up here? I started to get nervous. This was all very eerie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called the elevator again, hoping for the even one to open. At least I was more familiar with that one, and I assumed that pressing 2 would get me back to the lobby. It was the odd one, again. I pressed 3 and it took me down this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt went down very far. It opened up to a short narrow hallway with just a door. There wasn’t another elevator next to me, only the one I came out of. I was surprised. \n\nJust one elevator… one long hallway… to one door. \n\nI walked out to push the door but It was locked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned around and I saw something that made my heart sink to my feet. The button for the elevator was taken out. It was just a hole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door was locked and I couldn’t call the elevator. How was I going to get out of there? I went to the door again. I tried to peek outside through the foggy small rectangular window on the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw someone sitting on the ground at the other side of the door. I tapped the window. The window felt so thick, so I didn’t know if he could hear me. I started banging very loudly. The legs moved. He heard me. The man got up and walked towards the window.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy relief disappeared when he had this eerie grin. That man, who was quite old, like late 50s, pointed at me and laugh. I was pissed off. How is this funny? I mouthed, open this door, please. \n\nHe continued to laugh. He clapped his hand above his head and jumped up and down, like a child. And he was also very tall, at least six feet. In the middle of his laugh, he said \"you will never get out of here!\" \n\nIn a flash of anger, I screamed, open this door right now! His face turned angry and he started slamming the door with both his hands, hard. He slammed it so hard, I was so startled. I thought he was going to break it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy was beyond mad. He started kicking the door. It was obviously not going to help me. I was horrified that he was going to come in and strangle me. The elevator door suddenly opened and I ran back in.\n\nWhat is this place? I thought to myself as the door slide to close. My heart was beating so fast I couldn’t hear myself think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, if this is 3, then let’s go up one, which is 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went up to 5, all the while thinking about the obsessive look of that angry man. Something about him does not appear human. It was as if he was something pretending to be human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 5th floor was a similar-looking narrow corridor, like the 6th floor. I exited the elevator and headed to the stairway. I walked down only one floor and it was just a door. And the door was locked. I looked through the window and I saw someone. A middle-aged cleaning lady.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so happy I found someone, and I was about to call out to her, I noticed her facial expression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cleaning lady just stared blankly out the window. That was the first window I saw in the building by the way. Then, suddenly, she snatched a pigeon from the window and began devouring it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe chomped on it hard. The pigeon was almost as big as her head, but she kept chomping and chomping. She then tilt her head up and tried to let the gravity help her swallow it. I then saw the shape of her teeth. They weren’t human. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the bird’s wings were flapping and its legs were twitching, she took one more big chomp which sprayed blood all over. As soon as she slightly turn, I quickly duck down. To be honest, I almost crap my pants. What is this place? I was so scared now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran back up the stairs. I figured, if I’m 1 floor underneath 5, and  I run up two floors, then I should be on the 6h floor, right? I got out and saw the sign, 2nd floor. I was so frustrated and scared I wanted to cry. Isn’t the 2nd floor the lobby? Why was the 2nd floor above the 5th floor? This ‘2nd floor’ was a long corridor without any office doors this time. Just an empty corridor with nothing in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a deep breath to think. So far I operated as if this building had a rule that can be understood if tried. But it was clear to me now that the building was designed to confuse or even trapped people. The fact that none of the floors had windows was by design. And that the more I tried to escape using normal logic, the worse it becomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also just realized something. In the lobby, the elevator was in the middle, yet when it opened up to each floor, it was always at one end of the corridor. That meant the building was divided in half. And that there are actually four elevators. Only two lead to the exit and the other two lead to nowhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to look around for the camera. If there were any, they weren’t obvious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood in front of a pair of elevators in front of me and think. I pressed down. An elevator opened up. This one was an odd one, and also a decoy. Because, the other elevator was on the other side of the even elevator in the lobby. I entered this one and pressed it to go up, then exited the elevator, and pressed down again, hoping to summon another one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe elevator next to it opened up. This one was even. It was the first one I rode. The lowest number on the button was 2. I pressed it, nothing happened, which made sense in a twisted way because I was already on 2. I pressed 6. And it went down instead of up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though there was a chance that there could be no exit, at least I’m doing something the designer of this maze did not expect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe elevator door opened and I was back on the 6th floor, where the insurance agent’s office was at.  remembered when I came up from the real lobby it didn’t take me that long to reach this floor. I went to the stairway of this floor and walked down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I saw it. The lobby. I could see it through the door. But it was locked. I was not having it at that point. I know the building was not going to play fair, so I am not going to play fair either. I smashed the window. Just as I was getting one foot out of the small rectangular hole, I heard the door opened loudly from above, and heavy footsteps rushing down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking that the only two people I had met in this building were the pigeon-eating lady and the angry man, I did not want to find out which one was coming down, I quickly climbed out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a few cuts on me but because I wore long sleeves I was mostly fine. I looked back into the hole and there was nothing. No more sound of footsteps. It probably stopped following me when it knew I got out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hurried out of there. I got to my car. Somehow I expected the tire to be slashed or something but they weren't. They were probably confident I wasn't going to escape. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven as I was driving away, I knew it was going to be a while before I see another person around there, because of how isolated this place is.  It was a trap from the start.",

        "text": "I finally burst into a clearing and had a glimpse of freedom… until I saw the tall and foreboding cliff jutting hundreds of feet above me. I spun around towards the monster… no, monsters closing in on me. There were two. Now three, and four? I turned back to face the cliffside and started to ascend. Instead of pursuing me the entities just opened their mouths. There was no inhuman scream or stereotypical monstrous noise. Instead, the emergency ringtone of my phone rang out in the clearing.\n\nI woke up with a start to a bright room. *Must be the full moon,* I thought. It was much brighter than usual though. The emergency tone was still ringing as I got groggily out of bed. I went over and checked my phone. The emergency tone was an official government broadcast. On the screen, it read,\n\n***GOVERNMENT BROADCAST:***\n\n***PLEASE REMAIN INDOORS. LOCK ALL WINDOWS, AND DOORS, AND TURN OFF ALL WORKING LIGHTS. DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON. REPEAT DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON!*** \n\nThe message was unsettling. I decided I’d just heed its warning and head to bed. Upon dismissing the notification I was bombarded with notifications. \n\n***\"You should come outside, it's so beautiful!\"*** Read one message.\n\nYet another said, ***\"The moon is so lovely tonight, you should take a photo!\"*** \n\nI was beyond confused at everything going on so I decided to check what the hubbub was about. I got onto my feet and took a singular step before another message notification pinged on my phone. It was unlike the crazed moon worshipers in the sense it didn’t mention the moon. It asked a single question.\n\n“Do you see what's going on outside? People are goin crazy!” \n\n“No, Finn, I haven't, what's happening?”\n\n“I think it's just easier to send a video…”\n\nIn the video, crowds of people stared at the sky, at what I presumed was the moon. After a few moments of just staring at a rogue, hulking specimen of a person stirred from his hypnosis. The man crashed through the scattered crowd like a knife through butter. He was fast approaching the camera, and soon he veered away to the left. The man stood before a car standing at least 2 feet over it. The man tilted his whole body back, and with a jolting motion slammed his head into the window of the car. The window immediately shattered, and upon pulling his head back, blood trickled down his face.\n\nIn the video, crowds of people stared at the sky, at what I presumed was the moon.

People snapped out of their trance and quickly rushed towards anything remotely weak enough to be demolished. Windows were shattered, doors were kicked down, and cars swerved into households. Blood soon followed the rampage. It flowed onto the street. For every shattered window there was a corpse. \n\nThe bloodshed seemed to slow for a moment until all at once, every still living person turned towards the camera. There was a glazed look in every pair of eyes, whilst their blood became a mascara for those who dared to pay a price to obtain it. I soon realized to my dismay that they weren't looking at the camera, but past it. All the entranced humans flocked to where the camera was held. Screams ensued before the camera’s feed quickly cut off.\n\n“What the *hell* was that?” I texted.\n\n“That's the situation almost everywhere right now. Apparently, if you look at the moon that happens. The military is too afraid to go outside in fear of becoming one of those things so we're just stuck in our houses for the foreseeable future.”\n\nIce ran down my spine. “Do you know how many people have been outside that we know?”\n\n“Not too many of us, but I know Frank went outside before the warning was sent out, and I haven't heard from him since, so It's safe to say he's part of *that* group now.” \n\n“Hopefully he's okay. Are those moon people attacking people who're inside?” \n\n“They might be, all I know is a friend on Facebook had heard something inside his house. Since then I haven't heard back. To be safe you should hide somewhere safe inside your house.”\n\n“Okay, thanks. To be safe I’m getting off my phone. I’ll message you when I get out of this.” \n\n“Okay, I also need to get off for a bit. I think there's something in my house so I'm going to hide.\n\n“Okay, stay safe.”\n\nI turned my phone off. Stupidly, I sat there just contemplating for a while enduring this storm of craziness. Some things were brought up in my mind. *When did all this start? How was the moon affecting people so strangely? Why was the moon just now affecting people?* \n\nLike Nascar, my mind was racing; but, there was a wreck. The crash from downstairs echoed in my brain. I was quickly jutted into a state of panic, my heart rate spiked. Had those people gotten into my house? What had happened? I'd locked all of the doors, and windows, and turned off all the lights, so how had the people known I was in here? How had they gotten in?\n\nMy phone lit up as I fumbled with the closet door. \n\nThe message on my phone read “There're creatures on the inside too. They're everywhere, nowhere is safe…”\n\nI was about to respond, but just then I heard a thud outside the closet door. Something had struck my room door. The sound of scratching soon followed. The sharp appendages of something slowly reach up to the handle of my room door. The door handle rattled as it turned, the hinges screamed as the door swung open, and my breath hitched as it walked in.\n\nIt scuttled through my room desperately trying to find something. I sat with bated breath trying to figure out what to do. Could I kill it? It was 2 feet tall. The size of an infant. I’m sure I could punt-kick it into oblivion, but what could it do? The spines hinted at a defensive evolution, but what was it doing here? There was too much to think about, and luckily that helped to calm me down; however, that’s why the creature caught me off guard when it shattered a glass jar in my room. I jolted making the slightest noise, but it was enough.\n\nIt looked towards my hiding spot and I gazed into the eyes of this situationally fear-inducing foe. At that moment the radio plugged in downstairs shattered the tense moment as it blared a radio message from the government. I could barely hear what it said, yet some words were still audible.\n\n***THIS IS AN URGENT BROADCAST FROM THE US GOVERNMENT:***\n\n***ALL RESIDENTS ARE URGED TO STAY INSIDE,***\n\n***A DANGEROUS SITUATION HAS OCCURRED OUTDOORS,***\n\n***FOR THE SAFETY OF YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVE,***\n\n***STAY INDOORS!!!***\n\nThe noise immediately sent the humanoid creature scrambling for the stairs to find the source of the noise. A buzz came from my phone and I looked down to see another text message. The radio played the broadcast on repeat for a while, and it gave me time to check my phone.\n\n“I think the government doesn't know what's happening. I just found a video of a person in a situation with the new creatures. Do you want me to send it?”\n\n“Sure. I need to know what I just saw in my room.”\n\n“Wait, there was one in your room?!?” \n\n“Yes, I saw it from my closet. It was about two feet tall with spikes on its back.”\n\n“You're lucky, that's not even the worst of them. Maybe you could just stay hidden and they won't find you.”\n\n“What do you mean that's not the worst of them? What did I just see?!”\n\n“Yes, do you want me to send the video?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nAgain soon I got a notification of a video being sent to me. I soon noticed that it wasn't the only notification that came through though. I was reading through all my notifications and ice coursed through my veins.\n\n*“WE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE”* Read one.\n\n*“WE’RE COMING FOR YOU.”* Read another, but the last one was the worse.\n\n*“THAT CLOSET CAN'T HIDE YOU!”* \n\nWith that last message, I started to fear for my life. What should I do?\n\nAnother message came from my friend. “What did you think of the video?”\n\n“They know where I am.”\n\n“They do? You need to run! Get outside! run away! Whatever you do, don't get caught, and look at the moon.”\n\n“Okay. I’ll text you when I make it to safety.”\n\nAt this point staying seemed futile, so I got ready to make a break for it. I took a deep breath and slowly opened the closet door. The thing, whatever it was, was still downstairs most likely toying with the radio. \n\nIt was dark and spooky, which I guess is the best description I have. Trees were whizzing by me as I ran. Why did I run in the middle of the night? you might ask. I was being chased. It was unseen but fast, and was gaining on me. I looked to my left and right to find a better path to run on, but only saw trees. Leaves crashed against my face as I ran. Stinging branches slapped my body causing me pain. I just hoped that was the only thing that would cause me pain tonight.  \n\nThe radio soon shut off as the sound of metal ripping came from the kitchen. A familiar pittering noise came as the monster started walking towards the stairway I came from. I quickly ducked around another corner as the imp strode up the stairs. When the door to my room squeaked open again I made a break for the back door.\n\nGetting to the door, I turned the knob and quietly slipped out the door. Everything was going smooth until I felt a tingling sensation on my neck. Red eyes stared out at me from the 2nd story window of my house. It knew where I was... so I ran. I ran out of the town, and away from my house.\n\nThe moon was bright enough that I didn't need a flashlight. \n\nIt was dark and spooky, which I guess is the best description I have. Trees were whizzing by me as I ran. Why did I run in the middle of the night? you might ask. I was being chased. It was unseen, but fast and was gaining on me. I looked to my left and right to find a better path to run on, but only saw trees. Leaves crashed against my face as I ran. Stinging branches slapped my body causing me pain. I just hoped that was the only thing that would cause me pain tonight.  \n\nI finally burst into a clearing and had a glimpse of freedom… until I saw the tall and foreboding cliff jutting hundreds of feet above me. I spun around towards the monster… no, monsters closing in on me. There were two. Now three, and four? I turned back to face the cliffside and started to ascend. Instead of pursuing me the entities just opened their mouths. \n\n*\"Honey, why are you running?\"*  One asked. It was my mother's voice\n\n*\"We know we haven't been around much, but we are now.\"*  Now my father's voice.\n\nThey sure as hell were good at mimicking voices. \n\n*\"Stay with us, Edward.\"* Even the voice of him. The one voice I'd always wanted to forget.\n\n*\"I'm sorry I left you, but it wasn't my choice.\"*  A drunk driver made that choice for him. He'd left so early in life, but he was right, it wasn't his choice. I wanted to stay with him, and I knew he wanted me to. I knew I still had a choice, and I wouldn't disappoint him. \n\nSo I kept climbing. I knew if he were actually here he'd want me to keep going. He may not have had a choice, but I do. I knew of a cabin in the woods that not even my closest friends knew of. I'd be safe there for however long I could stay, I think. I ran for a few miles finally getting to the cabin and hopefully a safe place. \n\nI opened the door and heard nothing but silence. The clock I saw on the counter read 4 a.m. The night was almost over, but it was a start. I then started to relax. My body was slowly starting to realize I was no longer in immediate danger. I then checked my phone for any new messages.\n\nA message from my friend read “Hey! You haven't responded for a while, are you okay?” \n\nAnother had been sent a few minutes later. “Hey. I'm getting worried, are you okay?”\n\nFinally the last desperate text. “Answer me! Are you still okay?”\n\nAfter an hour of his waiting, I finally responded.\n\n“I'm fine, I got out.”\n\n“Where are you?” \n\n“Somewhere safe, are you still at home?”\n\n“Ya, but never mind me, where are you?”\n\nThis caused me to pause. Why did he need to know? I set my phone down for a second to think, then it hit me. I had told him I hid in the closet. Less than a minute later the creature had come into my room. I had said I was running away and coincidentally the creature knew exactly where to look to spot me. Something was wrong.\n\nMy phone pinged again. “Hey, where are you?”\n\nAgain? He didn’t have this bad of a memory.\n\n“Why do you need to know?” \n\nThere was a long wait before he messaged back.\n\n“I don’t, it’s just better to know you’re somewhere safe.”\n\n“Then why keep asking where I am? I’ve told you I’m safe.”\n\nThere was no reply so I replied again. “Finn. How did they know where I was? The closet? They even knew exactly when to look out of the window to see me running.”\n\n“I don’t know…”\n\n“Tell me. Tell me why every time I message you they know exactly where I’m going. Why you’re so adamant about knowing my location.”\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n“They’ll find you.” \n\n“And I’ll wait till them. The weapons I have here can hold off an entire armada.” This was a bluff, but they didn’t need to know that. With that last text and lie sent, I passed out.\n\nI woke up around 6. It was still dark, yet notifications from my phone lit up the room I now lie in. Every message was from others asking, 'where are you?' They should know I wouldn’t respond. It was ridiculous how little thought was being put into the texts anymore. I felt safe until the last text fell into my inbox.\n\n***Found you!***\n\nI looked around the cabin noticing nothing strange. No scuttling, no scraping. I decided to go to the window to see if the scout was outside, and to my dismay my tracker was. It wasn’t alone either. Several of those monolithic and uncanny creatures stood outside. Stygian red eyes burned in the night like laser sights on a gun. They had found their prey. I didn’t know what else to do, so I hid. I tried finding a great place to hide as the sun began to rise. I was surprisingly ready for the end. I had no weapons. I couldn’t go out with a bang, but with a whimper. \n\nA violent end was not the answer, however; because, for some reason, a benevolent god decided to save me. As the creatures approached the house the sun in turn followed them. At first, they didn’t notice, but soon discomfort seemed to creep up on them. Upon realizing their discomfort’s source they tried to flee. It was all in vain though. \n\nAs the sun struck their skin the creature's bodies hissed. Agonized wails filled the night air; a symphony of every pained voice in the world. Soon these creatures, and their cries melted into the ground with nothing to show of themselves but a burnt crisp on the ground.\n\nI was safe for today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!!!

        "text": "  \n\nThe greatest, and at the same time, most horrendous year of my life was when I was fifteen. The forest behind my neighborhood was an idyllic setting for adults who stared out their kitchen windows while washing dishes or sat on their decks grilling out and smoking cigarettes, but for the kids it was an escape from the world. The forest was a different universe with rules of its own, offering inscrutable signs of something deep and mysterious hidden from everyday reality. The farmer who owned the land was too old to farm anymore. He had no family, or at least none of them that he cared about, and he decided to sell the land. The land would be developed and an apartment complex with only six units would be hastily thrown up where once stood trees, hills, and the best damn bike trail in the world. No one wanted it. Everyone hated it. At every stage of its development we, the neighborhood kids, were there to tear the shit out of it. It was frustrating to lose something we loved, but I have never had so much fun in my life, with the opportunity to cause so much destruction for something I hated so much. The parents knew what was happening but never mentioned it, nor even acted like anything was happening. They were content to let the mayhem continue without any interference. In the end, the dragon of chaos was uncontrollable, as it always is, and we were faced with a terrifying realization that we unleashed it and gave it the momentum it had been craving.  \n\nI lived near a dead-end street, where all the neighborhood kids hung out. Most of my friends lived there but some of us migrated from other parts of the neighborhood. It was the perfect place to live and play. Most of the people that moved there did so because of the somewhat rural feel of the environment. The bulk of the forest lie behind that dead end street. It was nestled right behind my best friend Steve’s house. He had a tiny back yard, with a small creek running through it. On the other side of the creek was the forest. I often envied Steve, with his bedroom window looking out over the wooded landscape, near to everything we admired about life- our clubhouse, the miniature Grand Canyon, and our bike trail. Years later though, I felt sorry for him, being so close to that icy nether world that would forever haunt our memories. Beyond the forest was an open field, with some hills and lonely isolated trees. There was a dirt path that ran the length of the fence line that separated the forest from the farmland and the property across the field. Steve had a small motorcycle that we would push through the woods and through an opening in the barbed wire fence, that we had cut ourselves. We had to take turns who would go first because it wouldn’t be long before the farmer would start up his tractor and chase us out of there with his shotgun and rock salt. To the west of the woods, was a medium security prison facility, with a vast array of buildings. It was a good distance away from our neighborhood but sometimes we would get so bored and curious that we would walk to the facility, not daring to come too close to the fence. \n\nThe first sign that we were losing the forest, were the survey markers. We had been throwing rocks off the cliff that we called the miniature Grand Canyon, when Karen, spotted an orange flag waving in the wind. \n\n“What is that?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I responded.\n\n“Those are for marking the land to be cleared for construction. Damn.”\n\nSteve knew a little more than most of us. “But I’ll ask my dad about it, just to make sure.”\n\nIt was as we feared. Most of the parents had already known about it. They were unhappy, but there was nothing they could do. We decided otherwise. We went and talked to Chuck and Gary, two other friends, brothers, that lived on the dead end, and they agreed that we should do something about it. So that afternoon we went and pulled up every survey marker we could find and threw them in the creek. Chuck and Gary were a little older than the rest of us and they invited us back to their house to celebrate. Up to that point, celebrating to me was cake and ice cream, but they had graduated to something a little less childlike. \n\n“Who wants a little whiskey? Coalton?”\n\nOf course, he had to ask me, and with Karen there. \n\n“Sure, why not,” like it had been a while since I had tied one off. \n\nChuck poured a little in a glass and I sipped it down. I started coughing and wheezing, my throat burning like fire. Why do people drink this stuff? Of course, after a while I would find out why, and then the next morning I would be asking the same question as before. Everyone began laughing, especially Gary. He could barely breath he was laughing so hard. \n\n“You dumb sum bitch! You got to throw it down fast. We ain’t wine tasting here!”\n\nEveryone kept laughing for several minutes and at first, I was a little embarrassed but after a few proper shots, I began to see the humor. \n\n“We got a mission,” interrupted Chuck, always the serious one. “They ain’t gonna build this shit. Not if I have anything to do with it.”\n\nWe all agreed, but over time you forget things, other matters more important, like building the perfect ramp, impede upon your previous plans. A month passed and the machines moved in. They knocked down the barbed wire fence and cleared a portion of the forest. Chuck was furious. We let this happen. He motivated us to do more, to keep our promise. So, we cut hydraulic hoses, busted windows out of the office trailer, and routinely stole equipment. After a while, the foreman hired a security guard, and we backed off yet again. \n\nAnother month passed and three units had been framed and sidewalks poured. Every now and then I would go and tear something up or write some profanity in the drying concrete out of a sense of duty and obligation. I admit it was fun, as long as it was every now and then, and the coast was clear. Chuck wanted more though. He wanted something done every day and he wanted some major shit done, tires slashed, more windows broken, so much more than what we were doing. He was a teenage terrorist, I swear. He drove us crazy. \n\nAnd then one day it stopped. Chuck had stopped caring. He had gotten a girlfriend. Amy, a beautiful red head, long and slender, with the cutest voice I had ever heard. I didn’t blame him one bit and so the mission lagged more than ever, and three more units were framed. \n\nOne winter day it snowed, and the construction site had an eerie look. Two-story skeletal buildings dotted the land, incomplete, mired in mud and snow. The security guard had not been seen in a while. Maybe they felt they could save money now that most of the vandalism had died down. It’s amazing the influence one person can have. Without Chuck, the developers could somewhat relax. I mean somewhat because the rest of us weren’t angels. We didn’t stop everything. In fact, we enjoyed hanging out in the half-finished units, especially at night. We would climb the unfinished wooden stairs to the second story and go to the edge where no walls yet existed. It was dangerous but exciting. We would tear some foam insulation from the walls and make huge “paper” airplanes and toss them from the buildings, seeing who could engineer the best design. We also upgraded our clubhouse with stolen supplies. We took plywood, nails, shingles, and even some carpeting. Well come to find out later, Gary had ripped that up from a house that was for sale on an adjacent street. Our clubhouse would have been the envy of the neighborhood if we would have let anyone in, but we didn’t, because everything in it was hot, burning with felony charges. \n\nOne Friday night we were in the clubhouse when Chuck made an appearance. He was filthy stumbling drunk. Amy had broken up with him. The mission was back on. \n\n“Nice playhouse, you fucks. Instead of doing what I needed you to do, you decided to make a little penthouse in the woods.” \n\n“It’s over,” said Steve. \n\n“Yeah, man. Just calm down.” \n\n“No Gary, you calm down.”\n\nChuck stumbled in with a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey. He slumped down in the far corner, dragging mud all over our carpet. It was a rule that you had to take your shoes off before you came into the clubhouse, but we let him slide because he could beat the tar out of all of us by himself. He didn’t say much after that, just stared off in the distance. \n\nEveryone was getting a little bored and sleepy. I was about ready to go home myself. It was after one in the morning, and I would have to sneak back into the house through the back door, hoping my parents wouldn’t hear me. We were all in agreement, but Gary was a little hesitant. He didn’t know how he would get Chuck home.\n\n“Wait a little bit longer. He’ll get better. Let him sober up a little bit. Don’t leave me here with him, please.”\n\nWe agreed, but I was getting nervous. I needed to get back home. Outside we heard some footsteps approaching.\n\n“Shhh… someone’s coming,” whispered Karen.\n\nMy hands started sweating. I heard it too. We were dead still. I looked up at Steve. He had a worried look on his face. \n\n“Amy. Fuck you Amy” Chuck started mumbling. \n\nGary clinched his teeth in anger, but he dared not go near Chuck in this mood. I could see the hatred in Gary’s eyes. The footsteps got louder. We had a shower curtain hanging over the entrance and I could see underneath a pair of tennis shoes. There was stillness, nothing moving for about a minute. I pointed at the door. Steve looked and then the curtain snapped back. \n\nWe had two lanterns in the clubhouse. They were bright but they cast long shadows and the light was only focused in a small area. Standing in the door was a short man with choppy black hair, as if he had cut his own hair, and with no skill whatsoever. He wore a long button up shirt, blue jeans, and a blue jean jacket. His clothes looked to be three sizes too large. His face was painted with heavy amounts of cosmetics, and he was wearing cotton gloves. \n\n“Can Charlie come in?” he asked. \n\n“Well yeah, but we were about to leave. You can hang out though,” I offered. \n\n“No! Come on in Charlie. We have a mission. Do you want to join our mission?”\n\n“We need to get home Chuck.”\n\n“Shut the fuck up Gary. Charlie, these apartment buildings don’t belong here. We got to tear this shit up. Are you with us Charlie?” Chuck had revived, and unfortunately, taken a shine to this weird stranger at our door. \n\n“Oh yeah, Charlie likes tearing shit up.”\n\n“I like you, Charlie. Let’s go. Everyone now. War, we’re at war.” Chuck shuffled out the door and past our new comrade. Charlie followed willingly with excitement. He skipped along like a child on a playground ready for the chaos that was about to ensue. The rest of us were not so willing. Wanting to stifle my fear, I grabbed the bottle of whiskey and gulped down as much as my mouth would hold, swallowing fast and hard. The rest of the group did the same. \n\nWe put on our shoes and trekked through the woods for about a minute, coming out in the open only after I had tripped through a thorn bush. Karen giggled, but I could tell she was scared; it was a nervous laugh. This felt different. This felt like a drunken rage on top of a heart-rending breakup. This was careless, not carefully planned. We were just along for the ride. We got to the first unit. Chuck didn’t hesitate. He punched right through the insulation and then kicked at the two-by-four framing. He was a madman, but it was fueled by alcohol and heartbreak; it was artificial. Chuck could be abrasive, but he could also be reasonable. Charlie was legitimate. He was a real mad man. He pushed Chuck to the side and barreled into the building. We heard a crack and then saw a two-by-four fly through a glass window. He let out screech and a laugh. Even though we were still outside, we could tell where Charlie was inside because he was punching and throwing things through the windows as he made his way down to the other end of the unit. He wasn’t quiet either. He would yell and laugh, saying, “Charlie likes this,” over and over, as if that was the only words he knew. \n\n“Charlie! That’s my boy! Tear it up Charlie.” Chuck had gotten riled up with Charlie’s enthusiasm. He ran inside the building, and we could hear him ripping through wood and glass. At that point, the rage was contagious and the rest of us went in and did the same. I grabbed some insulated wiring and ripped it out of the electrical enclosure. I saw Steve doing the same on the opposite wall. Gary was kicking at some framing. Karen was tearing down insulation and at one point she ran outside and gathered some rocks. \n\n“Here.” She handed me some rocks and I followed her outside. We started throwing them through the windows. It was invigorating. We were lost in the mayhem, not realizing that a security guard had pulled up in a truck. The green lights were flashing. I finally noticed it and motioned towards the truck. Karen looked at me in confusion and then turned her head towards the truck. She started fast-walking back towards the clubhouse, picking up her pace as she got further away from me. I could see her waving me to follow her. I ducked in the building where Steve and Gary were. \n\n“Hey, security guard. Let’s get out of here.”\n\nWe all made our way back to the clubhouse, except for Chuck and Charlie. \n\n“Coalton, do you think they got caught?” asked Karen. \n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nWe waited for about thirty minutes when Chuck and Charlie entered the clubhouse laughing. \n\n“You chicken shits. Oh well, it’s alright because I’ve got Charlie now. You should have seen the damage he did. This dude is a monster.”\n\nChuck sat back down in the corner and handed a beer to each of us. He swigged on the bottle of whiskey and then handed it to Charlie. \n\n“Only the best for Charlie. Here’s to a good year. A good year for drinking and a good year for getting high.” Charlie pulled out a joint. He lit it, puffed, and passed. We all took a hit. It was my first time, probably all of ours, except for maybe Chuck and Charlie. \n\n“A good year for friends,” said Karen. \n\nEveryone held up their beers in agreement. \n\n“A good year for fucking,” said Steve, immediately ashamed of his outburst. \n\nCharlie snickered. “Ain’t none of you got laid. Don’t lie to Charlie. Little kiddies.” There was an awkward silence and a little bit of embarrassment. We took another hit, and I was feeling good. I broke the silence. \n\n“A good year for vandalizing.” It wasn’t a very profound line, but I guess the weed had taken effect. We all laughed our asses off like it was the greatest thing anyone had ever uttered. Charlie especially enjoyed it. He was throwing his head back as he laughed and I didn’t know if it was the beer and weed, but I thought I saw two rows of teeth. \n\n“You damn right Coalton. Couldn’t have said it any better.” I was proud that Chuck liked what I had said. For all his faults, it was him that most of us were trying to impress. “Time to get home and to bed. Ready to do it again tomorrow night.” A part of me was ready to do what Chuck wanted, but the other part of me was scared of Charlie. I went home that night and made it inside without my parents noticing. I laid in bed, not able to sleep, worrying about this stranger. \n\nSaturday night rolled around, and I had put on dark clothes. I thought about painting my face for camouflage but then I wondered if Karen would think that childish. We met up at Steve’s house, all of us except for Chuck.\n\n“Where’s Chuck?” I asked.\n\nGary sighed, “He’s with Amy. I guess they’re back together.”\n\n“Just like that.” I was sort of relieved. The more I thought about the mission, the more I realized it was hopeless. Those apartment buildings were going to be built no matter what we did. \n\n“Well, we should postpone tonight.”\n\n“No Coalton, let’s do it. I have some tools.” Steve pointed towards the garage door and leaning against it was a sledgehammer and a pickaxe. I was surprised by his willingness to trudge on through without Chuck. I was sure he was losing faith like I was and ready to be done with the whole affair. I should’ve walked away and took Karen with me. \n\n“Well, let's go to the clubhouse first,” responded Gary. “I left a hammer and some pliers there.”\n\nSteve led the way, followed by me and Gary. I was angry at Steve, for pushing this thing forward. Karen was behind me and as I jumped to the protruding rock that helped us to cross the creek, I slipped and splashed down into the water, hitting my elbow against another rock. Karen laughed. I swear I did more dumb shit in front of her than anyone else. My elbow was bleeding profusely. I had a deep gash, split open and throbbing with pain. \n\n“You, ok?” she asked, stifling more laughter.\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine.”\n\n“Hold up, I’ll go get a bandage. It won’t take long.” \n\n“No don’t worry about it. Let’s go.” I had three shirts on, and I just took off one of my shirts and tied it around my elbow. I was a little chilly before my plunge into the creek, but now I was absolutely freezing, with uncontrollable shaking. \n\nWe made our way through the woods then took the westward trail that led to our clubhouse. Steve had one of the lanterns lit up as we made our way. I remember looking up at the light and shadows dancing in the treetops, forming diabolical shapes and figures. I imagined they were dancing demons, an audience hungering for violence, anticipating with joy the further demise of our innocence. \n\n“Do you think Charlie will be there?” asked Karen.\n\nSteve stopped, we all stopped. The thought froze us. “Shit, I hadn’t even thought of that.” It was a long pause, and I was hoping that Steve had changed his mind. “I don’t think so. He’s got better things to do than hang out with us.” We resumed our course, and now that I think back, there were so many opportunities for me to speak up or walk away. Regret is a master analyzer of everything you should have done, diagnosing to the very tiniest detail the fucked-up decisions you made. \n\nWe were about fifty yards from the clubhouse when we noticed a flickering of light coming from inside. When we got to the shower curtain, we could hear Charlie talking to himself. Steve pulled back the curtain and there he was crouched down in front of a fire he had built on our new carpet. \n\n“Mission time.” He looked up from the fire he had so intently been staring at. \n\n“Charlie, you don’t have to come. We don’t want you getting into any trouble because of us,” Gary reasoned. \n\n“No, Charlie want this.”\n\nGary went and got the hammer and pliers from a toolbox that was sitting in the corner. \n\n“Charlie smell blood.”\n\n“Yeah, I fell in the creek and busted my elbow.”\n\nCharlie smiled and nodded his head, as if in approval, a predator realizing there was a weak one in the fold. He unnerved me. I shouldn’t have said anything. Now I was the zebra without any stripes, the young cripple foal without a mother. \n\nWe made our way back through the trail heading east to the clearing, ready for battle, but this time Charlie was leading the way. Steve had the sledgehammer, Gary the pickaxe, I had the hammer, and Karen had the pliers. We left the units closer to the woods alone. Those we had already defiled and mutilated. The other three units were uphill from where we were. The complex was small, with one circular road, three units up top and three units below. \n\nWe got to the first unit. Charlie wasted no time. He ran into the building yelling as loud as he could. We all followed him inside, a last desperate charge against progress. The damage we could do now that we had tools was amazing. It’s been said that with the right tools you can do anything, and we were accomplishing some heavy-handed destruction. Steve was banging out walls, crushing through plywood, and knocking down boards with only a few strokes. Gary wielded the pickaxe in a more majestic manner, like it was Excalibur, being more selective with his shots. I was just hammering away at the windows, enjoying the sound of the shattering glass. \n\n“Give me that damn hammer! Why does the girl get the stupid pliers? What the hell can I do with these.” I agreed and handed them over. She smiled and handed me the pliers. I needed a rest anyhow. I sat back and surveyed the destruction. I thought to myself that everyone was doing a fantastic job. I wondered how Charlie was doing with no tools. He was at the farthest end of the unit, swathed in darkness. I couldn’t see him too well, but I could see his damage, and it was peculiar. He had torn down support walls, with little effort and with no tool, but the oddest thing was the marks he left in the plywood and foam insulation- they were claw marks, as if made by a bear. I saw him jump up out of the shadows and into the fading moonlight, thrusting his arms through the ceiling above. I knew the ceiling was at least eight feet tall. I noticed lying on the floor was a pair of cotton gloves. \n\n“Alright boys. Its over! Stop right now and lay everything you got in your hands on the floor.”\n\nI turned and looked back behind me into a blinding beam of light. I could see the flashing green lights pulsating through the window. The security officer had finally caught us. The mayhem was over. He started to say something else, but I couldn’t hear him. It had started to sleet, battering against the building and tumbling across the floor. \n\n“Everyone come over to where I can see you.” We dropped our tools and walked to the wall directly in front of the officer. I noticed he didn’t have a gun, just a flashlight and a radio. \n\n“Hey you down there. Didn’t you hear me? Get over here.” Charlie had never stopped. He kept on destroying as if no one was there, oblivious to his surroundings, focused only on tearing shit up. The officer walked down to where Charlie was, keeping his flashlight held out in front of him, the light illuminating and bouncing with every step. Charlie’s face finally appeared, patches of skin peeling from his cheeks, razor sharp teeth, and flashing red eyes. He leapt towards the officer, knocking him to his back, the flashlight hurled back towards where we were standing. All went dark but I could see Charlie raise his hand and swipe downward at the officer. The officer was struggling to yell for help, but all we could hear was the bubbling of blood and saliva. Charlie swiped a few more times. \n\n“Charlie vandalizing this shit. Charlie like the teeth.”\n\nWe ran out the door, sloshing our way through the fallen precipitation, barely able to see through the wall of sleet and darkness. We were almost across the complex and to the beginning of the woods, when we spotted Chuck making his way towards us. \n\n“I’m proud of you guys! You did it without me. I hope you left a little fun for me.”\n\n“Get the fuck out of here. Charlie killed the security guard.”\n\nChuck started laughing. “Gary’s already been smoking.”\n\n“No man, he is not kidding. Charlie is a fucking monster or something,” I yelled. \n\n“You guys are stupid.” We started running again, with Gary trying to pull Chuck along with him. Chuck resisted and pushed Gary away. I turned to go help Gary get Chuck out of there. They were arguing. I could still barely see. There was enough light from the neighborhood street lights to give me an idea of what was happening. Gary had his back to me, and I could see Chuck’s animated expression of frustration, hands moving with each angry syllable. From behind Chuck, I saw a pickaxe hovering high above his right shoulder, then slam down into his collar bone. Chuck fell to his knees screaming. Charlie was trying to free the pickaxe from the bone, slinging Chuck from side to side and every so often lifting him off the ground. It was effortless for him and when he finally freed the axe, he thrust it through Chuck’s throat. \n\nI turned and left Gary. Years later I would feel guilty about it but it wasn’t a conscious decision, just the fear of death pushing me to worry about my own survival. In those situations, everyone else and their needs fades from your consideration. I ran straight through thorn bushes, tree branches, and plodded through the creek, not even considering hopping across with the help of that slippery rock. I saw Steve and Karen at the top of his driveway. \n\n“What do we do?” asked Steve. \n\n“Let’s go to my house and call the police,” Karen answered. Karen lived at the top of the dead-end street, and we felt like that was a good idea, far enough from the woods to be safe enough to call the police. \n\nWe ran to Karen’s house and followed her inside. She locked the door and went to check the basement door to see if it was locked as well. \n\n“Call the police. I’m going to go tell my parents what happened.”\n\n“Everything?” I asked. “Just say there was a murder. Don’t talk about what Charlie looked like. They won’t believe you.” She nodded in agreement. \n\nThe police did respond, and bodies were found. A security officer by the name of Ronald Davison had been brutally murdered, his neck and face slashed, and all his teeth were missing, presumably pulled by the attacker. Brothers Chuck and Gary Smith were both decapitated, their remains neatly laid in a clubhouse on the western side of the forest. The assailant was never caught. \n\nMy family didn’t stick around. My parents decided that it was time to move. We would find another neighborhood, where there was no risk of development, maybe something close to a state park. Karen’s family made a similar decision. They hung around for a year. I heard they moved to Dickson and had a nice farm, with about ten acres, something her father had been saving up for anyway. Steve, on the other hand, lived there until he went to college. I called him a few years later. He told me he moved out of his room so he wouldn’t be able to see those apartments. He also said that one day he built up the nerve to walk to where the old clubhouse used to be. It was gone of course. Ironically, he noticed survey markers littered throughout the area. He also claimed that he thought that Charlie worked for the apartment complex as a maintenance worker. He couldn’t be for sure but a year later he heard some girls in the school cafeteria talking about how weird their maintenance man was. He always wore long sleeve shirts and gloves, even in the middle of summer. He had thick make-up on his face and liked to talk to himself. He would always talk about the year 1984 and how it was a good year to vandalize.",

        "text": "\nLook, I know, this is the last forum that will offer me any sympathy but please hear me out, I need your help! \n\nI started a new account posting Reddit videos on the TikTok app a few months back, mainly due to the amount of similar accounts that were on there that seemed to do well. I had previously come across a post from someone showing you how to make this style of video, it was titled ‘How to get Followers quick’. The man in the video explained how you would have access to unlimited content, to post daily with minimal effort. It linked everything from which threads to find the best posts, to which Text-to-speech to use as a narrator. Also the best games to show  in the background of the video. I uploaded my first five videos that day and was seeing real numbers in terms of likes, comments and followers. \n\nI passed 7000 followers in my first week and was posting 4-5 videos a day. I did mention the Original Poster’s username at the bottom and in the cut out of their post. Maybe looking back I should have asked for permission but at the time I felt this was enough. It would also hinder the amount of videos I could upload per day, as I’d have to wait for replies. I got to 20,000 followers in my first month, with many of my videos surpassing a million views. \n\nWithin a 3 month period I had amassed a following of 345,000, I was also making good enough money off this exposure to enjoy my nights out. I couldn’t believe how easy it was, I even started another account and did the exactly same thing. It was, at the time something that seemed too good to be true!\n\nI got the first message 2 weeks ago and this is what it read: \n\n‘Hello, \n\nI have noticed you have taken a couple of my posts from the r/NoSleep forum, my username is *******, I would kindly request you remove these videos as I haven’t given you permission to use them.\n\nThank you,\n\nOP.’\n\nI read it full of cockiness and humour, I didn’t even respond back as I didn’t see it worth my time. I deleted it and carried on making my 3rd post of the day.\n\nTwo days passed and things were going well, I had gained another 10,000 followers, the guy who messaged me’s post was getting my profile a lot of attention! It nearly had 9 million views and 800,000 likes, I credited all of the users who’s posts I used in my video anyway, why complain, I’m doing you a favour.\n\nI received a second message from that same user:\n\n‘Hi again,\n\nLook. I have tried to be nice about this but you need to remove the video of my post now.\n\nIf you do not remove it, there will be consequences. \n\nYou have been warned. \n\nYou have 24 hours.’\n\nWow I thought to myself, this guy has a real problem. I sent a message back:\n\n‘Hey, \n\nI have credited you on the video and in my caption, there shouldn’t be an issue?\n\nDon’t threaten me or I will report you. \n\nDon’t message me again.’\n\nI thought that would do the trick, how dare he confront me. Does he not see how well his post is doing, he should be flattered. \n\nI received a response:\n\n‘24 hours, remove it’\n\nI scoffed, is this guy for real? I ignored and deleted it again. \n\nThe next day, I had a knock at my apartment door, I answered it but there was no one there. I looked down to see a small package had been left on the door mat in my hall. I picked it up and took it inside, after all, it had my name and details on it. I wasn’t expecting anything, normally the mailman would buzz the intercom when I have a delivery. I tried to look out of the window to see if anyone was on there way out of the building. After 5 or so minutes I grew impatient and stopped looking, I grabbed a knife, and opened the small cardboard box. \n\nI peeled the layers of brown paper and wrappings away until a small, wood whittled figurine emerged from underneath. It looked like a monk was sat cross legged, in the lotus position. His eyes were closed and had strange scrawled writing on its body that looked like some kind of ancient script, but I couldn't make out what it said. It looked just freaky, like a bad omen you would find in a fantasy horror film. I started to have an uneasy feeling like something wasn’t quite right. I didn’t like it, so I threw the wooden ornament away in the outside trash. I wasn’t having that thing in my home, I thought, feeling relieved it was gone. \n\nLater that night, while I was going through Reddit looking for new content, I could hear quiet footsteps coming from my hallway. The footsteps were accompanied by slight creaking noises that filtered into my apartment. I muted the TV I used as a comforting background noise and listened intently. Then ‘knock, knock, knock’ my door rattling with every thump. My body jolted  as I jumped sinking back into my chair. It was 11pm, who the hell could it be. I decided I was going to ignore it, whoever it was would leave soon. A few minutes past and just as my breath had began to normalise it sounded again ‘knock, knock, knock’. This time I jumped up and grabbed a large kitchen knife from the block. \n\nI made my way over to the front door, keeping my footsteps as soft as possible. I peered through the peephole, my searching eye was met by a dark empty corridor. I undid the lock and chain as I carefully turned the handle and opened the door. I clenched the knife in my right hand, while my arm uncontrollably shook. I stuck my head out and looked both ways down the hall and proceeding stairwell. I then cautiously stepped out for a better view, there was no one there. It was all deathly silent apart from the muffled sound of neighbouring TV’s. \n\nI closed the door and locked it up once again, I felt a sudden wave of relief across my body as I walked back to my living room. This feeling didn’t last long, I stopped in terror as I stared at my glass coffee table. There sat facing my direction was the wooden figurine I had threw out earlier. This couldn’t be possible, was someone playing some kind of joke on me! I jolted my head back as I heard soft whisperings behind me, they were inaudible, but echoing from my bathroom. I hesitantly made my way down my hallway. The door was slightly ajar as I approached and for a split second, I saw a shadowy figure looking at me through the crack. I couldn’t make out any prominent features but someone was definitely in there. A fight or flight moment rushed to my head as I ran at the door. I kicked it open, the knife still clutched in my hand. \n\nI was left stood in my empty bathroom, panting from a mixture of fear and adrenaline. It was nearing midnight and I called my dad, I asked whether I could stay over, I wasn’t going to spend my night in here. I made an excuse that my heating had stopped and wouldn’t be fixed till morning. I don’t even want to go back to my apartment. \n\nOnce I had drove over to my Dads, and was all set up in my old childhood bedroom. I opened up my TikTok app, I had forgotten to post any more videos due to the night events. I decided it was too late and passed out on my bed. \n\nThe next morning I checked the app again, there was a new message in my inbox I had received in the early hours of the morning, it was from the same user. \n\n‘I warned you of the consequences, no one can help you now. ‘ \n\nI was freaked out, I tried to report the user but later that day his account was no longer there. I went on their Reddit account, it was also gone. In the few days after, I couldn’t face staying in that apartment again. So I ended the apartment lease and moved back to my dads. The strange occurrences seemed to follow me and so did that wretched figurine. I would feel my bedsheets move and tug as I slept at night, the kitchen tap would frequently turn on at random times day or night. The worst thing of all, was every time I would throw out or chuck that small terrifying statue into the nearby river, it would end up just sitting, nestled upon my pillow that same evening. I decided to shut down my accounts soon after and I even deleted the app, trying everything to make it stop. It hasn’t, if anything it’s getting worse. \n\nPlease help me, I don’t know what to do anymore and I really can’t take much more of this!\n\nPlease, a warning to other content creators, if you ever receive a message like this, please do not ignore it. \n\nJust do what it says or you to could end up with a small parcel at your front door.",

        "text": "Listen, I’m not really even sure if anyone is going to actually read this and believe me but- I have to tell someone…anyone…I feel like I’m going crazy but I KNOW I’m not and since I just recently moved…I have no one close by who I can trust to talk to about this without them thinking I am totally insane. I’d call my Mom but…she has enough on her plate right now, I don’t need her to get worried…I don’t even know if she would believe me to be honest…and the last thing I need is her thinking I’ve lost it in the new city I’m calling home, all alone. \n\n\nSo…I guess I’ll just start at the beginning, I left my hometown for the big city. No shiny, special reason for why really. I finished school, had been applying to jobs left and right and managed to get an interview via video call for an above entry level position in my field. I guess I nailed it-cause within a week I’d gotten the offer and was packing up what little I had into my parents old, dingy minivan and hopping onto the interstate. \nI moved into a new apartment in an older but more affordable area of the city, got settled in for the first month with establishing a new routine and learning my way around my new job. \n\n\nBy my second month I was at ease enough to start branching out and exploring more. I found a nice bar by my work that I began to frequent once a week for a quick drink, I found a local market by my apartment that I started to go to on the weekends for fresh produce, and I joined a nearby gym that boasted quality equipment and being open extra late at night for busy nine to five’s like myself. \n\n\nIt’s a nice gym, don’t get me wrong, the equipment is well maintained and fairly new and they recently remodeled the locker rooms-I was perfectly satisfied upon joining. I had absolutely no issues really until four nights ago, when I decided to go relax in the whirlpool after a particularly grueling session. I soaked for awhile, enjoying the jets and the hot water, thinking about nothing in particular and then hopped out and headed for the locker room-passing by a set of doors I hadn’t paid any attention to when I’d entered. I’m still learning the place so I was unsurprisingly curious and took a quick peek-one door led to the gym’s sauna, the other led to the steam room. \n\n\nI’ve sat in a sauna before, my old gym had had one that I’d tried out a few times-it was nice enough I suppose. This gym’s sauna was packed to max capacity when I looked in-and I made a mental note to check in another time for it. I redirected my gaze back to the steam room door and tried to peer inside with no luck. Steam billowed all around inside and I could barely make out the shape of another gym member sitting on the bench in the room, the steam seemed to distort the figure at times though and I couldn’t really focus well on them. \n\n\nI thought about having a quick rinse and going inside to check it out, I’d never sat in a steam room before and it wasn’t nearly as packed as the sauna was, but I was quite tired already and still had to shower and eat dinner. So I decided I’d come back the next evening to try it out. \nI really wish I had just done the damn sauna instead. \n\n\nThe next night I came back and decided I’d do my workouts first before trying out the steam room, told myself it’d be a nice way to unwind after some good exercise and something to look forward to while I sweat my butt off. Work had run a little late so I arrived a little later than usual to the gym and found it much emptier than I was used to, which I honestly appreciated. I did my usual routine, made my way to the locker room for a quick rinse and then threw on a swimsuit and headed out towards the set of doors I’d passed the night prior. I took another quick peek into the sauna, there were a few people in there-not as many as the other night but still enough that I felt even more solidified in my choice of trying out the steam room, which from what little I could see inside of-looked empty. I remember feeling relieved almost, seeing that no one was inside, I could have this first time experience all to myself and enjoy a quiet moment of steamy solitude.\n\n\nI opened the door and stepped in and immediately was greeted by a swath of moisture and heat. The room smelled kind of like pool water, and as I breathed in the air felt thick in my throat. There were stone benches up against two of the four walls of the room, and the floor and walls were an earthy colored tile. Steam swirled all around me as I made my way over to one of the benches and sat down, my whole body was already slick with sweat and water and I felt my thighs slide against the moist stone beneath me. I jumped as a loud crashing sound suddenly echoed in the room, I looked up at the source of the noise to see steam pouring out of a vent up high close to the ceiling. I realized it was just whatever kind of machinery they had next to the room that must generate the steam, and settled back against the wall. \n\n\nI closed my eyes for a little while, letting myself relax and thinking about how nice, albeit slightly gross, it all felt. Every inch of my body was very much drenched and it had only been maybe a minute or two, and while the thickness of the air had been off putting at first I was quickly growing to like how it felt-like I was breathing…*more* if that makes sense. \n\n\nI really was rather enjoying myself until I felt something glide along my thigh, ever so slightly, and my eyes shot open. I couldn’t see anything. I immediately looked to my left and right, I hadn’t heard anyone else enter the room but-maybe someone had? Yet, as I looked around I saw no one, the steam was pretty much a swirling, white haze at that point-and it was nearly impossible to see a foot in front of me but, I couldn’t make out any figures within the room at all-and when I called out a quick greeting there was no reply, just my voice and the steam that still billowed out of the vent above me. Was it supposed to stay on that long? \n\n\nAs soon as I had the thought there was another loud clang and the steam stopped, I let out a deep sigh, trying to ease myself back against the wall. I was imagining things, I had to be-it must have just been a set of moisture droplets running down my thigh is all, that must’ve been what I felt. \nExcept…something just felt…wrong. I couldn’t quite place it but I honestly had the deepest sensation that I was not alone in that room. I had half a mind to just leave at that point, it had felt nice at first but it was beginning to feel weird, when I tried though…it almost was like my brain and body were disconnected and I was rooted to the bench. I just couldn’t move. \n\n\nAnd then I felt it again, only this time it was ever so slight on the back of my neck before stopping, and then it started again on my right arm-much less subtle that time and I knew it wasn’t moisture droplets dripping down my skin. Primarily because droplets trickle down and this…whatever it was, was going *up* my arm. \nI wanted to let out a scream, wanted to jump up and run out of there as fast as I could, slippery floors be damned, but I still couldn’t move. I couldn’t even turn my neck to get a look at what exactly I was feeling, I could only make out what little I could see through the steam from my peripheral vision which I’m honestly kind of glad now that I couldn’t get a better look at whatever it was. I could make out some kind of darkness, some sort of vague mound of shadow, and when I directed my gaze down at my arm I felt my stomach do a flip.\n\n\nSlimy, black tendrils slithered up my arm. They were thin and stringy looking as they glided ever further up to my shoulder with ease, they felt moist and radiated heat. It wasn’t until I felt them slowly wrapping and tightening around my neck that I started to truly process what was happening. My heart was pounding, I was frozen-my body entirely unresponsive to the commands my mind was screaming at it, and in that moment I thought I was going to die as my vision began to darken.\n\n\nAnd then it all went away in an instant as the door swung open and loud voices cut into the silence and steam. My arm jerked and just like that my limbs were back in action and I could move. I looked over to see a couple had walked in, chatting about something cheerfully and barely noticing me sitting there. The steam was no longer so thick and as my mind caught up with everything happening I quickly snapped my head to my right only to see…nothing. \n\n\nMy heart was still pounding, my throat felt tight, and my legs were feeling like jelly, I got up as quickly as they’d allow me too without slipping and falling and made my way unsteadily to the door-the couple still absently chattering away with one another and not even glancing my way. \nThe rest of my time at the gym that night was a blur, I didn’t shower there like usual-electing to throw my clothes on quick and shower at home instead. I had gotten some weird looks from the staff members at the front desk as I made my way out but I honestly didn’t care how I looked in that moment I just had to get *away*.  \n\n\nI made it back to my apartment safely, thankfully, and I remember sitting down in my shower and letting the coldest water I could possibly stand cascade down on me-I absolutely did not want anything warm, or hot, or *steamy*. \nI’ve taken a lot of cold showers since. \n\n\nCall me crazy but I actually plan on going back to the gym once I start to feel a little bit more…sane I guess, if I even can, which writing this all out for others to read has kind of helped. \nThe membership wasn’t exactly cheap or refundable and I do need some sort of physical work since my job is just hours on hours of sitting and staring at screens. \nI don’t plan on going anywhere near the steam room again though, in fact I think I’m going to avoid the entire spa and pool area altogether from now on. \n\n\nIf I ever stupidly get the desire to go back in there all I’ll have to do to remind myself is look in the mirror and follow the pale red marks that slither their way up my arm and around my neck.",

        "text": "I grew up in a village on the south coast of England.\n\nI had a quiet, sheltered childhood. In the summer, I used to explore inlets and caves and pretend to be a smuggler. I’d read about these rogues and knew they made fortunes from bringing in tea, spirits and lace and paying nothing in tax.\n\nI would stand at the entrance to a cave and the driftwood I had found became the sword I would use to fend off anyone who tried to steal my goods. \n\nBack home in the evening, the seashells I had picked up on the beach were transformed in my imagination into the coins I had earned from my crimes. I would count them off and plan my next daring deed.\n\nThe winters brought storms that sent waves crashing over the harbour wall at the southern end of the village. I knew the risk of being swept into the sea by this so keep my distance. I stood as close as I dared, though, and spent hours watching as the storm raged. Then I would go home and stand in the hallway soaked wet through and dripping onto the floor as I hung my coat up.\n\nThere was precisely one shop in the village, which sold most things you could possibly need, apart from on a Wednesday afternoon and Sundays when it was closed. \n\nSadly, as I started to get older, the shine started to go off life in the village. \n\nAs a teenager, imagination was no longer enough. I wanted real action. Ideally involving drinking and girls. \n\nBut there was no way I would ever get served alcohol in the village shop. The people who ran the shop, Mr and Mrs Owens, had known my parents since before I was born, and they knew I was not old enough to drink legally.\n\nAs for girls, there was hardly anyone my age living the village, apart from Kay. We’d grown up in houses a few minutes’ walk away and had always been friends, nothing more.\n\nIt was a dire state of affairs and I felt like I was getting unhappier by the day. \n\nWhat I needed was to be able to spend time away from the village. \n\nThe trouble was the nearest town was a forty-minute drive away.\n\nAnd even when I was eventually old enough to learn to drive, I did not have a car and there was only one bus, which stopped in the village twice a day.\n\nIf you looked in the dictionary under ‘middle of nowhere’ the definition would have been my village.\n\nBy the time I turned eighteen, I was desperate to get out.\n\nOne evening shortly after my birthday, I was sitting on the beach around a fire with Kay and Tony, who lived with his divorced father in a house that had been made by knocking three adjoining cottages into one. \n\nIt was late autumn. The sea was restless and there was a cold wind which sent sparks from the fire spiralling into the air. \n\nThe wood we had propped up to make the fire crackled as the flames danced.\n\nI could feel their warm glow on my cheeks and smiled.\n\n“Penny for your thoughts?” Kay asked.\n\n“The usual,” I replied, “I can’t wait to get out of this place. Until them I’m just enjoying hanging out and trying not to freeze to death.”\n\nThe others laughed at this. We all felt the same way.\n\nTony already had his escape route planned. \n\nHis father had worked in finance before taking early retirement and one of his old business contacts had offered Tony an internship with his crypto currency company in London.\n\nKay had her plan as well. She was going to sit her exams next summer and was already applying to universities for a place. She had decided against trying to get into a London university because the cost of living in the capital was eye wateringly high. Other cities, mostly in the north of England, offered the combined benefits of a busy social life, good courses, affordable living and, most importantly, being hundreds of miles away from the village. \n\nMy plans unfortunately were still vague. I had given up studying as soon as I could and my parents only business contacts were people they owed money to.\n\nDespite this, I was determined to follow my friends out into the big, wide world. \n\nTony had borrowed – his word – a bottle of wine from his dad’s wine cellar and he opened it, while Kay handed round the plastic cups. \n\nTony poured us all a measure that almost spilled over the top of the cups.\n\nNot wanting to waste any wine, we raised our glasses carefully and touched them together gently in a toast:\n\n“To the future, anywhere but here.”\n\nThen we drank. \n\nTony poked Kay in the side while she was taking a drink, which made her laugh and snort wine out of her nose.\n\n“Such a lady,” I joked, and she reached over and gave me a playful slap on the cheek. \n\nHer cheeks were flushed and she was smiling, and I thought: *You’re beautiful*.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time I had thought this and sometimes I wished there was a way we could be more than friends.\n\nWe all sat in silence after this, watching as dusk fell over the ocean. Then it was time to head to our homes.\n\nAs soon as he got to his feet, Tony was stumbling slightly and weaving across the sand – he was clearly a bit drunk. \n\nKay and I avoided him as we did not want to get bumped into.\n\nShe looked at me as we kept our distance from Tony and said, “It’s cold.” Then she linked arms with me. \n\nAny thoughts I had of the cold were swept away. She felt so warm beside me and I could smell… I don’t know what it was. A scent she was wearing, the shampoo she used, or maybe it was just shower gel.\n\nIt did not matter. It was amazing and I was wishing we had miles to walk not yards when Tony came to a sudden halt.\n\nHe was staring up.\n\n“What is it?” I asked.\n\nHe responded by pointing his hand at the sky out over the sea. \n\nI couldn’t see what he was pointing towards at first. Then Kay tightened her grip on my arm and gasped.\n\nAnd I saw it then.\n\nIt was a shooting star. \n\nBy my side, Kay gasped and said, “That’s so beautiful. It’s a sign that amazing things are going to happen to all of us.”\n\n“Actually,” I replied, “shooting stars were often seen as portents of doom in medieval times.”\n\nKay let go of my arm. “You’re such a loser,” she said and then she walked away.\n\nMy heart sank – all the way through my boots, into the cold, lonely ground. Or at least that’s the way I felt as I watched her heading back to her parent’s house.\n\nTony was long gone but I did not care about him.\n\nI trudged home alone.\n\nI did not sleep well that night. I felt so stupid, opening my big mouth like that and once again wished me and Kay were more than friends.\n\nWhen dawn finally arrived, I felt groggy and depressed. I dragged myself out of bed and felt too sad to shower so I pulled on the clothes I had been wearing the day before and went down to get something to eat.\n\nMy parents were both in their home office, presumably making more deals that would not work out, and I made it through to the kitchen without anyone asking me what my plans were for the day.\n\nI hated it when my parents did that.\n\nI emptied the last pack of cereal into a bowl and opened the fridge to discover there was no milk.\n\nTypical!\n\nThinking how the universe hated me, I pulled on my coat and went to the village shop.\n\nMr Owens was on duty behind the counter. He was a short red-faced man whose idea of customer service was to look at you like you were about to try and steal a packet of sweets or a bottle of washing up liquid.\n\nI wandered over to the milk, but decided cereal was too much trouble so bought two chocolate bars, some sliced cheese and a can of soda.\n\nBreakfast sorted, I paid and got out of there. The weather had turned worse overnight and I had to put my head down as I walked into the wind on the way down to the harbour wall. There was a bench near there, next to the old church, where I could sit and eat.\n\nThe old church was the largest building in the village. It was no longer used as a place of worship. Like a lot of churches in small villages across the country, it had been deconsecrated because its congregation had fallen away to next to zero. \n\nIt was now for sale with planning permission to turn it into a residential property. \n\nOne developer had bought it a few years before, but they had gone bankrupt not long after starting work, leaving the inside of the old church half gutted and littered with debris. \n\nThe exterior was a mess as well. The windows were boarded up and a No Trespassing sign was stuck to the front doors of the church. They were clearly starting to rot thanks to the damp sea air and the rain.\n\nIt was a shame that such a nice building was going to ruin in this way. \n\nThankfully, it wasn't my problem. \n\nAs I passed the harbour wall on my way to the bench, I saw that the Campbell brothers were working on their boat. It was low tide and the boat lay tilted over slightly to one side in the silt. The hull was filthy and worn, much like the rest of the boat. It looked barely seaworthy. I personally would not have gone out in it.\n\nThe Campbell brothers, Tyler and John, claimed to be fishermen, but I did not believe them. I was convinced they were the modern-day version of the smugglers which I had admired so much when I was a young child.\n\nHowever, I did not admire them. I felt the opposite: I did not like or trust them one bit.\n\nThat day, they must have noticed me – we were the only people around – but they continued to work on their boat and ignored me.\n\nThat worked for me. I sat on the bench and opened the first pack of my feast.\n\nAfter I had eaten, I should have gone home and gone online to check out career websites so that I could start getting my life into gear, but instead I drifted around the village and then walked for miles along the coast.\n\nThe inlets and caves were now just places I could be alone with my thoughts.\n\nHours passed and it was soon getting dark again. I had wasted another day and started to drift back towards the village.\n\nI was about a mile away when something caught my attention.\n\nThere was a light flickering out at sea. It could only have been coming from a vessel. \n\nAs the last of the light slipped away, I focused on it, and saw that the light was flashing on and off. It seemed to be a signal.\n\nBut who would a vessel be signalling to out here in the middle of nowhere?\n\nMy answer came minutes later when I spotted another vessel slowly making its way out to sea. Even from a distance I recognised the Campbell brothers’ shabby boat straight away.\n\nMy guts tightened as I realised what was going on.\n\nThey were going to pick up illegal goods and smuggle them ashore.\n\nThat was it. It must have been.\n\nAnd, sure enough, their boat was almost at the other vessel now. \n\nThe sensible thing to do was report the Campbell brothers to the authorities, but out here I knew I would have no signal on my mobile phone. \n\nAll I could do was wait.\n\nI did not think there was any way I could be seen by the Campbell brothers from out there on the water but instinctively I crouched down anyway. \n\nAnd it was lucky I did, because, about ten minutes later, I could see the Campbell brothers’ boat was heading back to shore – and if they kept on the same course, they would come perilously close to me. \n\nI crawled backwards until I was inside a small cave. \n\nOn the plus side, this meant I was hidden from view if they should land close by.\n\nOn other side, if they brought their contraband into the cave like the smugglers of old, I was a sitting duck.\n\nThis had been a bad move.\n\nI needed to make a break for it. I could be safely home in no time if I ran as fast as I could.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nThe Campbell brothers’ boat was feet away from the beach and its engine was stuttering to a stop, and one of them – Tyler – was clambering ashore.\n\nI swore under my breath and moved further back into the cave just as John Campbell appeared on the deck of their boat.\n\nHe was joined by two people whose faces were hidden beneath the hoods of sweatshirts. \n\nThey must be the Campbell brothers’ co-conspirators in this crime, I figured.\n\nTheir presence also meant I was outnumbered now by four to one.\n\nI started to feel sick with anxiety and I was cramping up.\n\nI bit my lip and tried to stay as still as I could.\n\nThe two people whose faces were hidden were getting off the boat as well, helped by Tyler. He then turned to his brother and waved. John went back into the cabin and powered the engine back up and soon the boat was heading back out to sea.\n\nIn the meantime, Tyler had started to lead his two mysterious companions along the beach. They were heading in the direction of the village. \n\nI counted to ten then, despite my common sense screaming at me to leave it, I followed them. \n\nI kept at a distance, ready to make a run for it if they turned and saw me, but they seemed focused on keeping up a fast pace. \n\nThe only thing slowing them down was the wind, which by now was becoming vicious. I was almost blown over at one point by a particularly fierce gust. \n\nIt was the last thing I needed when I was trying to follow them without being noticed.\n\nI was relieved when they at last reached the village. They headed round to the small back door of the old church. I was shocked to see Tyler take out a key, open it and usher his companions inside. \n\nHe followed them, closing the door behind him, but leaving it unlocked. \n\nI was desperate to follow but, before I did, I needed reinforcements.\n\nI messaged Kay and Tony, telling them what I had seen and asking them to get here now.\n\nA flurry of questions followed. Then Tony told me there was no way he was leaving the house on a night like this, before adding that I was crazy. \n\nKay, though, said she would be there as soon as she could. \n\nI was still cold, windswept and on edge, but I felt better knowing Kay was on the way.\n\nAnd secretly glad that Tony would not be joining us. That it would just be me and Kay. \n\nA short while later she arrived. She was bursting with excitement.\n\n“This is wild,” she said – far too loudly. \n\nI put my finger to my lips to shush her and whispered, “We can’t do anything to let them know we’re on to them.”\n\nShe nodded and added in a much quieter voice, “Are you sure we should not just phone the police?”  \n\n“I’ve been thinking about that,” I replied. “What would we say? That one of the Campbell brothers is in the old church with a couple of strangers they brought ashore.”\n\nThe nearest police station was more than an hour’s drive and there was no way they would send anyone out all this way for something so insubstantial sounding.\n\nKay got that straight away.\n\n“So, what’s the plan?” she asked.\n\nPowered by the adrenaline pulsing through my veins, I grinned and said, “We sneak in and we get hard evidence that they are up to no good. Is your phone fully charged up?”\n\nShe held her mobile up. Its screen glinted in the darkness.\n\nI gave her the thumbs up and crept towards the unlocked door. \n\nI opened it as slowly and gently as I could. At one point it creaked. It wasn’t that loud a noise but I froze anyway and stood there while my heart beat far too quickly in my chest.\n\nBehind me, Kay giggled.\n\nI turned and gave her a stern look. She put her hands over her mouth but kept laughing. \n\nBeginning to wonder if I should have just saved the day on my own after all, I entered the old church with her close behind. \n\nIt was too dark to see much inside and for a moment we just stood and listened. I could hear voices, but they did not seem to be too close, so I chanced turning on the torch on my phone. Keeping it pointed downwards, I checked out our surroundings. \n\nWe were in a small, empty room. There was door ahead of us, which Kay walked up to, opened sligthly and peeked through the gap. “It's very dark,” she whispered. “But I can see pieces of wood piled up where the pews must have been ripped out and broken up by the developer. We’re close to the bottom of the staircase as well. You know, the one that leads up to  the balcony.”\n\nWe had both sat through weddings and baptisms when we were younger and the church was still open, and we remembered its layout pretty well. \n\n“That’s great,” I whispered back. “Can you see Tyler and the others?” \n\n“Not sure,” she answered. Then said, “Yes. They are at the far end of the church, by the front doors. Someone has just lit a candle and I can see them bright and clear.”\n\n“Ok,” I said. “Let’s try and get up the stairs and into the balcony. That would be a great vantage point to see what they’re up to.”\n\n“Copy that Echo-Leader-Two-Six” Kay replied with a cheeky grin that was clear even in the gloom of the small room.\n\nWe made our way slowly up the staircase. There was no creaking, and we reached the balcony without Tyler or the other two having any idea they were not alone.\n\nAnd now being spied on.\n\nUntil Kay tapped me on the shoulder, interrupting my staring and listening.\n\n“Why did they get off the boat down the coast and not in the village?” she whispered. We were almost touching, and I could feel her breath on my skin.\n\nI was tingling all over because of this as I whispered back, “If the storm had not driven everyone else indoors, they could have easily been seen if they had disembarked in the harbour. There was much less chance of them being spotted if they came into the village on foot.” \n\n“And what now?” she asked.\n\nI did not know and shrugged.\n\nA few moments later things became clearer.\n\nTyler’s phone rang. He listened without saying anything then put his phone back in his pocket, turned to the other two and said, “That was my brother. He has been listening in on the police channel. A tree has been blown down by the high winds. It is blocking the road. There’s no way we can drive you out of the village tonight. You’ll need to shelter here. You’ll be safe. No one will know you are here, and then we can take you tomorrow night”    \n\nFrom their body language, they seemed angry about this.\n\nTyler told them he would get blankets and something to eat and drink for them and headed towards the small room which led to the back door.\n\nLeaving just the four of us in the old church.\n\nMe and Kay, whose closeness to me was making me feel slightly dizzy. And the two people who had been brought here, and who we still knew nothing about.\n\nThey started to pace around and one of them pulled back the hood of their sweatshirt. I could see now he was a young man, not much older than myself. His dark hair was cropped short.\n\nAnd he was with a young woman. She had revealed her face as well. Her long dark hair hung loose over her shoulders.\n\nKay leant back in close to me and said, “Do you think they have come here to try and escape some awful situation in their country?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I replied, “But even if they have, we still can’t trust them until we know more.” \n\n“No,” Kay said, “Look at them. They are just like you and me, only they are strangers. We need to help them.”\n\nBefore I could stop her, she was standing up and walking back down the staircase.\n\nI kept my head down, cursing under my breath, while she made her way towards them.\n\nThey saw her – there was no way they could not – and stood facing her. They seemed tense, uncertain.\n\n“It’s ok,” Kay said. “Don’t be afraid.”\n\nShe was only a few feet away from them when the young man looked her straight in the eye and raised his right hand. His palm facing her, he spread his fingers and continued to stare at her. Even from a distance I could sense the intensity of his gaze.\n\nAll of a sudden, Kay’s legs buckled and she fell to the ground, where she lay unmoving.\n\nI felt myself panicking. I was losing it and no idea what to do.\n\nI could only watch as the young woman approached Kay, leant over her, and said something which shocked me to my core: \n\n“I will feed on her first, brother.”\n\nThe young man shook his head.\n\n“No, sister,” he responded. “We should not feed, not here in this small place. We do not want to draw attention to ourselves. When we reach London, we will be two strangers in a city of strangers and there can choose our prey without fear of discovery. For now, let her remain in the trance and we will be gone when she wakes with no memory of us. But be assured, my sister, we will drink her blood if the hunger grows too great. We will take that risk.”\n\nAs he said these last words, he smiled and drew back his lips.\n\nA wave of cold terror passed through me.\n\nI could see his teeth.\n\nHis long, curved fangs. They looked razor sharp. \n\nAnd I knew deep inside, in the part of me that was instinctively afraid of the dark, that he was not human.\n\nThat he was a Vampire.\n\nThe woman he had called sister was smiling as well and her fangs were revealed in the flickering candlelight. \n\nShe was like him. An evil creature of the night.\n\nAnd Kay lay helpless at their feet. \n\nI could not wait for their grotesque appetites to spiral and for them to hurt her. I had to act now. I had to save Kay. \n\nNot caring about keeping out of sight anymore, I leapt to my feet and ran down the staircase.\n\nOnly, before I knew it, I was not running. I was falling.\n\nI’d tripped over my own feet and was tumbling awkwardly done the stairs. \n\nI landed in a heap, winded and hurting in loads of places. I scrambled back to my feet and stumbled forwards. \n\nThe Vampires watched me. They both had narrow smiles on their faces. I could tell they were laughing on the inside at me. \n\nThey thought I was a joke, not a threat.\n\nWell, I would show them!\n\nI gritted my teeth and ran at them screaming.\n\nI was on a collision course and made a fist, ready to lash out, but they stepped out of the way with lightning speed and my momentum carried me into a pile of broken wood.\n\nI skidded along until I came to a halt. Pain flared in my leg. There was a piece of wood sticking in my thigh.\n\nI grimaced, took a deep breath and pulled it out. Its tip was sharp and covered in my blood. I looked away from it before I puked and turned my attention to the Vampires. “You… leave… my friend… alone,” I gasped. \n\nThey laughed out loud at this.\n\nI could feel the world around me blurring and starting to spin and knew I must be close to passing out.\n\nThat couldn’t happen.\n\nI took a deep breath and grabbed a second longer piece of broken wood and used it as a crutch to help me get to my feet.\n\nThen inspiration struck me.\n\nI put the two lengths of wood together, making a cross, which I held high in front of them.\n\n“Take that,” I yelled and waited for them to cover their faces and start hissing in agony. \n\nInstead, the man walked calmly towards me and said, “Some parts of our legend are true, others were invented by people who needed to get out more.”\n\nThen he fixed me with his gaze and raised his hand.\n\nI could not let him put me in a trance as well. \n\nIn desperation, I lashed out with the sharp tipped bloodied piece of wood.\n\nI could only hope that piercing a Vampire’s heart with a makeshift wooden stake was grounded in truth, not myth.\n\nThe Vampire looked at me. His eyes were wide with shock. His hands grasped the section of wood that protruded from his chest. Then his skin began to crack and fall away, and he opened his mouth as if to scream, but his jaws were nothing now but naked bone. With shocking speed his whole body collapsed, until all that was left of him was a pile of dust lying on the floor.\n\nI stared at this, transfixed.\n\nHis sister cried out mournfully then turned to me and said in a voice pulsing with anger, “You will die for this. It will be a slow, agonising death. Your screams of pain will be exquisite to me.”\n\nShe took a step towards me.\n\nThen gasped.\n\nLooked down.\n\nThe point of a wooden stake was sticking out of her chest. She staggered, tried to turn and see who had done this to her. \n\nThe other end of the stake on which the Vampire was impaled was held by Kay – who said, “No one messes with my friends.”\n\nThe Vampire snarled but it was too late, her body was already breaking apart and falling away and soon she too was nothing but a pile of dust on the floor. \n\nI smiled grimly and staggered over to the front doors of the church. I started to push at them.\n\nKay understood and joined me.\n\nThe rotting wood soon gave way, and we opened the doors as wide as we could, then stood and watched as the wind swirled through the old church, scattering the Vampires’ remains and making sure the foul creatures would never walk this earth again.",

        "text": "[\\[Part 1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11aqoki/i_found_a_church_thats_stained_glass_windows_show/)\n\nFor hours Amber and I sat on the tailgate of my truck smoking her cigarettes and doing our best not to look at the skeletal church just ahead of us. When I asked why she was there, she just kept repeating that she was supposed to meet me. I asked her to elaborate, but she said it wouldn’t make sense. I did my best to let it go, but the vagueness festered in my mind.\n\nShe was the daughter of Trevor Bate’s youngest brother. Since the youngest age she could remember, her family would only talk about him in hushed tones. Whenever she saw photos of him and asked her parents to tell them more about him, they changed the subject. A missing family member was always a delicate subject, but Trevor Bates had been the first of many disappearances from that damned place and the family wore it around their necks like an albatross.\n\nStories of her lost uncle followed her all through her school years as well. Children teased her and teachers seemed to interact with her as little as necessary. The girl grew up like an outcast based on small-town superstition. I nodded and smoked as she told me about those troublesome years.\n\n“I met a nice boy in high school, though,” she said with a smile. “Michael Baxter. We were only seventeen, but I thought we may get married, ya know?”\n\nHis name struck my brain like a bolt of lightning. Michael Baxter had gone missing seven years ago at Old Salem. A few high school seniors camped out probably fifty feet from where we sat on the tailgate of my truck. When the boys woke up the next morning, Michael was gone and the doors to the old church were pushed inward.\n\n*No foul play suspected*, his file had said.\n\n“I met my wife when I was seventeen,” I said through a lump in my throat. “The sting never really goes away when you lose someone.”\n\nAmber looked at me in confusion. I could tell she wondered how I knew about Michael, so I tapped my badge sitting between us to silently indicate where I had gotten the information. She smiled at me sadly and nodded before lighting up another cigarette.\n\n“I need to get going,” she said as her shoes made contact with the hardpacked dirt. “It was nice to meet you.”\n\n“Amber… Italy,” I called out as she walked back to her car. “How did you know you’d meet me here?”\n\nShe sat in her car and fired the engine. \n\n“I went inside after Michael vanished,” she said, pointing toward the church through her open car door. “Saw it in the stained glass.”\n\n“What did you see?” I croaked. My pulse skyrocketed and I could feel hot blood and the pounding of my heart in my ears.\n\n“Don’t go inside, Henry,” she called back. “I think that’s what the last window wanted me to tell you.”\n\n“What did you see?” I screamed at her, but it was too late. Amber shut the door of her car and hammered the ignition down the rough path. I watched as the pillars of dust floated into the air and her taillights broke the fallen darkness of the evening.\n\nI would find out later that like so many others, no one ever spoke with Amber again. Her blue Ford Taurus was discovered twenty miles out of town on the side of the Pennyrile Parkway. I never saw the report, but I always wondered what it said.\n\nProbably *No foul play suspected*.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nAmber had left the rest of her pack of cigarettes on the tailgate and I sat in the dark, smoking them all and gazing at the edifice of Old Salem Church. Headlights shot through the dilapidated structure from the parkway nearby giving it the illusion that dark things moved between the wooden boards of the wall. I knew I should get in my car and go home, but I wanted to go inside and see the place for myself.\n\nI wanted evidence.\n\nPulling open the rusting toolbox in the bed of my truck, I grabbed a flashlight and a crowbar. I slipped on the light and aimed it at the church, bile roiling in my guts. As I began to walk toward the door, I felt like a child scared of the darkness. There was no sensible reason to be filled with so much dread.\n\nI pushed against the door expecting some resistance from the warped frame, but to my surprise, it pushed open gently. Rows of splintering pews filled the sanctuary inside, washed in the moonlight that filtered in through the patchwork of holes in the roof. An old coat rack draped in tattered cloth leaned haphazardly against the pulpit looking like an otherworldly minister.\n\nFraming both sides of the sanctuary were ornate stained glass windows that seemed almost to glow through the darkness inside. The flashlight and crowbar tumbled from my hand as I shuffled forward in a trance. They were captivating.\n\nOn the left, nearest to the door was a scene of a young boy and a dog playing in front of the stream. It was Gilligan, my first pet. We played together every day after school until he was hit by a car.\n\nNext to it was an image of me during a high school baseball game. The number 3 was emblazoned on the back of my jersey and a bat dangled from my right hand as I watched the ball soar through the air. It was the only homerun I ever hit and the coach screamed at me to run for home.\n\nA third was of Rose and me beneath a concrete angel, kissing in the moonlight. Tears filled my eyes at the glass image of my wife, so young and beautiful in my arms. Happiness and sorrow swirled through my veins.\n\nCasting my eyes to the other wall, the window farthest away showed me a vision of myself at the police academy graduation ceremony. I was young, thin, and so proud that day. Still so unaware of how that job would keep me away from the woman I loved.\n\nIn the center, two people sat on the tailgate of an old pickup smoking cigarettes. It was the perfect image of that very afternoon as I sat talking to Amber. The white glass of her smile glinted in my eyes. I hadn’t noticed her smile as we talked, but she must have. Some happy memory in her ocean of sadness had won over her for just a moment.\n\nMy eyes drifted to the floor for a moment as the buzz of tinnitus filled my ears. The next window would be the one to show me the future. I had hoped that much like Amber, I would be allowed to leave that wretched place, unlike so many others. Truly though, I feared the window would show me what had taken so many others before.\n\nWith a sigh of horror and resignation, I looked toward the sixth window.\n\nThere was an old man, a mop of white hair swept to the side, sitting on one of the church pews. Bright reds, yellows, and oranges came together to create a wall of flames behind him. Dark figures stood in the blaze, looking down at the forlorn man.\n\nLooking down at me.\n\nI turned and ran for the door and burst into the cool evening air and soothing moonlight. My heart thundered as my feet hammered against the ground toward my truck. Fumbling the keys from my pocket, I jumped in the seat and readied myself to get as far away from that dark place as I could.\n\nThen I realized my hair had been white on the last window. It had shown me well into old age. Salt and pepper danced across my once dark mane, but it was far from white. The last window didn’t represent that day, but I felt in the pit of my soul that the horrible image would someday come to pass.\n\nIn a stupor, I got out of the truck and headed back to the bed. A dented red gas can sat near the toolbox and I pulled it over the edge. I wanted the madness to stop then and there. If Old Salem Church burnt that night, there would be no white-haired version of myself to burn there in the future. No more missing kids either.\n\nI’d gladly pay whatever price came my way. \n\nThe gas soaked quickly into the dry wood of the church walls. I emptied the entire canister and tossed it inside. The loud *clang* when the metal hit the sagging wooden floors made me wince. Without another thought, I pulled Amber’s abandoned lighter from my pocket and struck the flint next to the wood.\n\nFlames erupted quickly and I walked back to the truck and drove away. Reds, oranges, and yellows licked at the night sky in my rearview mirror. I laughed and then burst into tears.\n\n*It’s over*, I told myself. *No more disappearances. No future in the flames.*\n\nI wish I’d been right.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nI spent the rest of the night drinking scotch by the police scanner in my garage. Chatter was minimal during that night. My anxiety increased with every passing minute as I waited to hear someone report the fire on Parkway #3 Road. It had been nearly midnight when I got home and by 3 AM there still hadn’t been a peep.\n\nPart of me was relieved thinking that somehow no one from the parkway had seen the flames. Maybe it burnt so quickly that no one even saw it to call in. Even if it was reported, the blaze would have gone on so long there would be nothing of the structure to salvage.\n\nAnother part worried that the flames had gone out. I knew it was impossible, but still, I worried.\n\nSleep came hard in the early hours. As soon as I woke up, I turned the scanner volume up, but there was still no word of a fire in Crenshaw. My stomach sat heavy and a new sense of dread washed over my body.\n\nI got in the truck and drove as quickly as I could to Parkway #3 Road and down the twisting drag. There were no fire trucks or emergency vehicles. No smoke. Only the line of trees blocking the view where the church would have stood.\n\nAbove the trees like a craning vulture, I saw the steeple of Old Salem Church; unburnt and waiting for new carrion\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nWhoever finds these pages, I just want you to understand what has happened to me. I burnt down Old Salem Church for the first time in 1995. It was standing in the same spot the next day as though nothing had happened at all. I felt insane, but I came to accept that the hateful place holds some terrible grip there. Something there hungers for the lives it snatches away.\n\nI burnt it again five more times over the years, but no matter how much gas I pour or even if I stand there to watch that hellish frame crumble in on itself during the blaze, it’ll be standing again the next day. It seems indomitable. A bastion of despair and hopelessness.\n\nMy hair has long since gone white and I’m tired. Children still vanish in the area and each time it happens I slip a bit further into madness. No one listens to me when I beg them to demolish the place. County costs are too high, they say. Putting up a gated fence or sealing off the road is out of the budget.\n\nPerhaps Old Salem gave me the answer though.\n\nMaybe it just wants me.\n\nI’ve watched the place burn five times standing on the gravel drive and once in the rearview mirror of my old truck. It never works. I’ve been going about it all wrong.\n\nThe sixth window showed me sitting inside, wreathed in flames. So I’ll give that vile building what it wants. There are six cans of gas in the truck and I plan to douse the whole place. I’ll sit inside and wait for those dark figures to watch me burn. Maybe that’ll be the end of all this.\n\nIf I’m gone tomorrow and Old Salem Church is still standing, God help you all.\n\nI did what I [could.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/11aw8f2/a_note_about_my_writing_future/)",

        "text": "It was an average Wednesday morning until I got a letter from an unknown address. I carefully opened it, as I was a dangerous person, it very well could’ve been poisoned or something like this. Dozens of people wanted me dead.\n\nLuckily, it was nothing dangerous. I checked out the picture that was attached to the letter. It was a photo of a man, probably in his mid-60s with gray hair and a clean-shaven face. He wore classical clothes, it looked like a person from the 19th century. It looked a bit uncanny, I’d say. His eyes were so big, and his overall facial structure was… strange. Then I read the letter.\n\n*Dear Marilyn Hayes,*\n\n*The tales about your talent are well known to me. I’ve heard you only need a name and a few days at maximum to eliminate your target. This time, your target is Lord Maximilian, I’ve attached a picture of him. He lives in an old castle a few miles from Harwich. It’s full of servants, so you have to be careful. Kill everyone if you have to. Don’t underestimate Lord Max and his staff. As soon as he’s dead, I’ll immediately pay your well-deserved payment of 2 million USD. Good luck, Mr. Hayes!*\n\nYeah, it was nothing special. Just an average bounty hunting job. The only extraordinary thing was the payment. I’ve never got such a high-paying job. 2 million dollars is a lot, even for a dangerous bounty like this. I could afford an early retirement with that much money.\n\nSo, anyway, I made a cup of coffee, then prepared myself for the job. I found my black, hooded jacket that I usually use for this kind of stuff. It had dozens of inside pockets, I always put the necessary items there. A pistol, a throwing knife, a regular kitchen knife, a curved dagger, two frag grenades, and a few milliliters of cyanide. \n\nI was ready to go. I smiled as I hopped into my car.  It was time to get rich.\n\nIt was a three hour drive straight to Harwich. I wanted to ask the locals about this Lord Maximilian before I would try to break into his castle. I also had to find a store, ‘cause I forgot to bring my cigarettes. \n\n“Ah, yes, Maximilian,” said the guy who owned the store when I asked him about Max. “The old man is a descendant of some British count, the guy’s crazy rich, he stays in his castle all the time, I haven’t seen him since the last decade.”\n\n“Interesting,” I said while packing away my pack of cigarettes. “I heard he has a shit ton of servants.”\n\n“Those servants do anything around the castle, they probably wipe his ass, too,” the guy laughed. \n\n“Yeah, haha.”\n\nAround 9 PM, I parked my car about two hundred miles from the castle, near the edge of a forest, then walked the rest of the distance. The building was, indeed, beautiful. It was also fucking huge. There was a large sign in front of it. It was already dark, but I could still read the hundreds of years old letters. *Harwich Castle, Thirteen Colonies.* So yeah, it basically just confirmed my theory that it was fucking old. Even older than I thought.\n\nI felt like I was a dwarf as I approached the front doors towering over me. I was a bit optimistic trying to get in there, but it was an old castle, there was no other way I could break in.\n\nI was surprised when I pushed the large door and it opened. I expected it to be closet, but it was a pleasant surprise, maybe except for the fact that it gave out a loud creaking sound, so probably the whole building heard me getting in. \n\nI slowly closed the door behind me. The hallway was dark, empty, and cold. There were no lights. I didn’t know exactly what I was looking for, but I started walking slowly and quietly, maybe looking for a servant to give me information about the whereabouts of Maximilian. Everywhere I looked, I saw more and more corridors and stairs. That place was a labyrinth. \n\nI stopped as I heard someone walking on the floor above me. I checked my weapons, then approached the stairs right in front of me. I slowly walked up the stairs, trying to make no sounds in the meantime. I progressed slowly, making one step at a time. I saw light at the top of the stairs.\n\nAs I reached the top, I noticed the corridor was fully illuminated, and at the end of it, there was a guy in formal wear, igniting the torches on the wall. Probably a servant, I thought. The guy heard my footsteps and looked at me.\n\n“Uhm, can I help you, good sir?” he asked with a confused face. Strangely, he had a British accent.\n\n“Hey,” I greeted him, still walking closer and closer, so I could kill him if I had to. “I’m looking for Lord Maximilian. I’m so sorry for bothering you this late, but I suffered a puncture while I was driving here.”\n\n*I just need to get a bit closer, only a bit closer,* I kept thinking.\n\n“No problem, sir.”\n\n“Can you tell me where is Lord Maximilian right now?” I walked closer and closer. *C’mon, stay there, and don’t try to run away.* \n\nAs I got closer, I noticed those strange characteristics on the man I saw in that picture of Maximilian. Those large, round eyes and strange facial structure… *Maybe he’s the old man’s son or something?*\n\n“Lord Maximilian is sleeping,” the servant said. I noticed a little smile on his face. But as I got closer, his face became stranger and stranger. I was only a few feet away from him. “His bedroom is on the top floor, but I think you should come back tomorrow, he doesn’t like when we interrupt him during his sleep.”\n\n*Great, he’s on the top floor, that’s enough information, I don’t need this stupid guy anymore.* I grabbed my dagger from the inside pocket of my jacket, and quickly stabbed it in the servant’s neck. He didn’t even flinch. Blood didn’t come out, there was only some weird dark-purple energy vibrating around the wound. He smiled like a maniac.\n\n“Well, well, Mr. Hayes,” he said. His voice was deeper than before. “You’re rude. I want to help and you want to kill me?”\n\nHis face immediately changed into something terrible. I pulled the dagger out of his neck and jumped back. He turned into some sort of monster. A skinny creature with purple skin and red eyes. His teeth were long and sharp. I thought I’ve lost my mind. *What the fuck is happening? Is it just a nightmare, right? Right?*\n\nThe creature jumped at me with a loud scream. I rushed to another corridor and tried to open a random door, but it was locked, and I still heard it running behind me. I tried another door, and luckily, I could open this one. \n\nI slammed the door shut behind me, just as the terrible creature tried to follow me inside. I held the door with my back, but I could feel that the creature on the other side was much more powerful, so I didn’t have much time. The room I was in was large, and it had about six other doors, every one of them leading into another room. *It’s a fucking labyrinth.* \n\nIn the meantime, my mind became less and less clear. I often forgot what I was thinking about, I forgot how I got there, it was strange, and I started to panic. *Maybe I’m crazy?* \n\nSo because of that, I don’t exactly remember what happened afterward, but I think I choose a door in the room randomly and rushed inside. I think I ran through a few rooms, and the next thing I remember is jumping inside a closet to hide. I was probably in a bedroom.\n\nHalf a minute later, the creature arrived in the same room. I sat quietly in the closet, shaking, while trying to hold my breath. I heard the monster laughing outside. It walked around the room for a few minutes. *Don’t find me, don’t find me, don’t find me.*\n\nAfter a while, the sounds stopped completely. I was sure he had left the room, but I still didn’t have the courage to leave the closet. I felt safe there. And my mind still wasn’t clear, and I couldn’t tell why. It felt like I was on drugs, I was unable to focus. My heart almost stopped when I heard a woman’s voice from outside. \n\n“You can come out now, good sir. Come, I can help you. That thing is not here anymore.”\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“I’ll tell you everything. Please, come out.”\n\nI carefully opened the closet door, holding my hand on the knife in my inside pocket, ready to defend myself if necessary. It was a young blonde woman, maybe in her early 20s, in old handmaiden clothes. She had an innocent smile.\n\n“Everything is okay now, good sir,” she said.\n\n*Good sir,* I thought. The servant called me the same. I also noticed the same strange features and those big eyes on the woman’s face, but I just couldn’t focus, everything was so foggy.\n\n“What was that thing?” I asked.\n\n“A shapeshifter. Terrible, isn’t it? But it’s not here anymore, you don’t have to worry.”\n\n“A shapeshifter!? Holy shit, I must be dreaming.”\n\n“I’m afraid it’s real, good sir. But I can help you escape.”\n\n“But… but I can’t escape. I have to kill Lord Maximilian,” as soon as I said this, I almost punched myself in the face. *Fucking hell, I shouldn’t have told her this.*\n\n“I see. Well, maybe I can help with that too,” she smiled.\n\n“No offense, but I’m not sure I can trust you,” I said, but I couldn’t argue anymore. My mind… I don’t know what was happening. It felt like a dream, or rather a nightmare, but I knew it was real. *Focus, focus, focus.*\n\n“Let’s see how I can earn your trust,” she took off her clothes, slowly, then approached me. “Come on, don’t be afraid. Just lay down there,” she pointed at the bed.\n\nMy mind was still unclear, and for some unknown reason, I did what she said. I slowly walked to the bed and lay down. The woman came closer, and with a quick move, she put both of my hands into a handcuff, then tied it to the bed, just above my head. *Hey, I’m not into this kind of stuff.*\n\nAs my mind became clearer and clearer, I noticed more and more uncanny features on her face. The smile that looked so cute a minute before now looked creepy and malicious. *For fuck’s sake, that’s the same fucking shapeshifter.*\n\nI tried to jump out of the bed, but the handcuffs kept me there. The woman smiled.\n\n“Oh, now you wanna escape? How cute!”\n\nAs she said this, she transformed into the same purple-ish monster again, and then turned into an old man. Lord Maximilian. Luckily, the thing transformed itself with clothes on, otherwise, it would’ve been really awkward.\n\n“You want to kill me, bastard?” Max asked. \n\n“I’m a fucking hitman, that’s my job. But if you pay me more than my current boss, then I’ll kill him for you.”\n\n“I don’t need you to kill someone, moron. I think you need a punishment for this. Yeah, maybe your arm will do it. Don’t worry, I’ll kill you anyway after that, but I want you to suffer.”\n\n“Listen, you don’t have to- hey, hey,” I shouted as I saw him grabbing an old axe from the corner of the room. Before I could say anything, he chopped my right arm with that fucking thing. My screams filled the whole building. I think I blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up, I looked at the remains of my arm, and it looked like the old guy had taken care of the wound. *But why?*\n\n“Because I don’t want you to bleed out. You’ll suffer for months. Or even years, now where is that old saw? It should be here.”\n\nMax turned his back to me and went into the corner of the room, searching for the saw in an old wooden chest. Yeah, there was no way I’d wait for that. My right arm, or at least what remained of it, hurt like hell, but that meant only one of my arms was handcuffed, so I could move more freely.\n\nI turned to my side, so I could reach my inside pockets with my handcuffed hand. *What the fuck should I use to kill this thing?*\n\nI grabbed a frag grenade, then pulled the pin. *1…2…3!* I threw the grenade as far as I could with a handcuffed hand. It landed at the end of the room, about a few feet from Maximilian. \n\nAs the grenade exploded, a shrapnel hit my foot, causing extreme pain there, but somehow I managed to ignore it, maybe because of the adrenaline. Max, on the other hand, was full of shrapnel, his skin was torn apart by it, then transformed back into that fucking monster, but its skin was torn apart too, so it looked even more terrifying. Didn’t matter, he was still alive.\n\n“Bastard,” he screamed as he ran back to the bed and grabbed my neck. He unlocked the handcuffs, then raised me in the air, holding me only by my neck. Whatever it was, it was fucking powerful. *This is the end. He’ll snap my neck, and I’ll die.*\n\nBut he just threw me through the window, the class cut my face multiple times, and I have no idea how many feet I did fall.\n\nI couldn’t even stand up from the pain, so I crawled for at least an hour before I reached my car. Finally, it was over. I decided to retire, and never accept a job like this again. I’m not a hitman anymore.\n\nI immediately drove to the nearest hospital in Harwich. They let me out the next day. I told the doctors I stepped on a butterfly mine in the forest, which caused my injuries. I don’t know if they believed it.\n\nWhen I went home, my wife immediately greeted me. He was obviously worried. I can understand her. She was happy when I told her I’m not doing this anymore. But then I noticed it, oh, for fuck’s sake, she had those big eyes and strange features, too. Where’s my real wife? Fucking Lord Maximilian killed her… He wants me to [suffer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)",

        "text": "Here’s what I know.\n\nAll started with that old house looking down from the hillside, I’m sure of that.  Broke windows, sagging roof and holes in the walls showing the dark inside.  Sitting off on its own from the rest of the town about 10 minutes walk through the trees.  Been lying there empty since before I was even born and I just turned 33 last month. \n\nI remember when I was little the other kids used to make up stories about it.  Say that in the basement, where the stone was crumbling and the wood rotted through, there were tunnels into the mountain.  Tales got crazier from there on out but they always started that same way.  Kids just trying to scare each other, I suppose.  \n\nStill, no-one was ever brave enough to go see.  I sure wasn’t.  You would never see me further than the line of rusted metal in the grass, all that was left of the fence and gate.  I would stay right there while the others dared each other to go closer, to look inside, to go inside.  They never did.  Something about the place, you know?  Silence like a weight on you.  It wasn’t quiet like a regular thing is quiet, like a … a table, or a bike or such.  Sounds stupid now but that house was quiet like an animal.  Like something watching you and waiting for you to look away.  \n\nHell I can’t explain it right I don’t have the words.\n\nSo my momma told me she saw someone leaving that place.  Said they come right out through where the front door used to be, just after midnight.  This woulda been 3 nights ago.  \n\nShe can’t go out much now but she sure does like to keep an eye on things.  Can sit at that window for hours on end, doing her crosswords and watching.\n\n“I saw em all right.” she said to me the next morning, “Sneakin out of there all surreptitious like.  Up to no good I’d say.  Wouldn’t be hiding otherwise.  Are you listening Marshall?”\n\n“Yes momma.”\n\n“What did I say?”\n\n“You saw em sneakin.”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\nWe was talking over breakfast (bacon and eggs) then I done the washing up.  Well I’m saying breakfast, was more like 1pm but that’s when momma gets up so that’s morning for her I guess.  Me and Noah, that’s my nephew he is 3 and a half, we already ate cereal at 8am early and watched cartoons like we always do.  \n\nThat stuffs not important, is it?  I'm sorry.  I’m not too sure what is or isn’t important so I’m just putting everything I can remember.\nWhere was I at?  Oh yeah, I got it. \n\nI heard voices out in the street and peeked out to have a look.  It was Officer Winters talking with our neighbour, that’s Miss Jacobsen.  This was real unusual seeing as, far as I know, she has never before had a visit from the law.\n\nI finished cleaning up and went out to have a listen because, if I’m honest, not much interesting happens in town.  They were both out on her porch when I got there, Officer Winters standing and Miss Jacobsen sitting holding her walking stick out in front.\n\nI recall him saying “ - so you ain’t seen or spoke with any of them? Not since last month?”\n\nMiss Jacobsen, she said “Not a word. Even then wasn’t more than a hello.”\n\nHe said “Well, can’t claim I wasn’t hopin for a different answer, but it is what it is.”\n\nThen she said “Jesus H Christ.  Marshall!  You ain’t even good at eavesdropping you idiot you just standing right there.”\n\n“Ah I’m sorry Miss Jacobsen.” I replied, “Hey Sheriff.”\n\n“I ain’t a sheriff, Marshall.  Officer Winters is just fine.”\n\n“Ah yeah that’s right.  Sorry I keep forgettin.”\n\nI feel like I say sorry a lot of the time but I’m also screwing up constant so I guess it works out.  \n\nThey was done so Mr Officer Winters came to our house next.  I let him in and got him a seat in the kitchen.\n\nMy momma came in with Noah, she had been doing her puzzles and he had been pretending to help.  Took her a minute to get settled and get her breath back.  It’s hard for her to walk much nowadays, she is quite a heavy lady (she would say “stout” if she was being nice).  Once we was all ready Officer Winters told us why he was visiting everyone.\n\nHe went on a bit but the gist of it was this.  Couple of miles over there was a house looking on the lake.  It was retired couple living there, had been since it was built.  Now here I must apologize because I didn’t see them often and their names escape me.  So Mr Winters had swung by to check on them as he did every month and neither of them was home.  But their car was there.  So he tried to phone and no answer.  Dropped back the next day and still no sign.\n\n“Could be on vacation.” I said.\n\n“Could be Marshall, could be.  Odd though that they wouldn’t tell a soul, not even their families.”\n\nHe sighed and got to his feet.\n\n“Sure it’s nothing to worry about,” he said, “just strange is all.”\n\nThat’s when momma told him about the figure she had seen up at the old house.\n\n“You certain, Millie?” he asked her.  That’s my mommas name I don’t think I mentioned that.\n\n“Shit yes I am.” she said, “Was a full moon and clear sky.  Rest of me might be decrepit but my eyes is just fine.”\n\n“Okay okay.” he held his hands up in surrender but he was smiling too.\n\nEveryone liked Mr Winters even momma, she wasn’t really angry.  They had known each other all their lives I think.\n\nI remember Noah had come over and sat on my knee.  Mr Winters smiled at him and took a long look around, eyes lingering on that house through the high trees.\n\n“Okay then.” he said, “You folks just be careful, you hear?  Make sure all these doors and windows are locked at night.  I know most likely it’s nothin but best to be on the safe side.”\n\n“Always do lock em.” momma said, which wasn’t quite right because it was me does it but I didn’t say nothing.\n\n“Bye Sheriff.” I said.\n\nAnd Noah said “Bye shrf” and Mr Winters rolled his eyes but he laughed too.\n\nNot much else happened that night I don’t think.  About 8 it was pitch black out, so I said I was taking Noah up to bed for his story.\n\nMomma said “It should be you reading to him Marshall not the other way around.  Goddam ludicrous, you can read and write well enough you ain’t that stupid.”\n\n“It’s mostly just animal names and pictures momma, he can do it fine.  And he likes readin and I like listenin so where’s the harm?”\n\nShe started swearing but dropped her glass so while she was picking it up I made my escape.  She had started drinking earlier than usual, which I can tell you is not a good sign for the night ahead.  I wanted to tell her to stop but I’d tried before and I know a hopeless cause when I see it.  Figured why have the argument again.  \n\nIn truth, most nights it was nothing.  Sometimes though she would go up to my sisters old room with a bottle, that’s when it was trouble.  I’d hear her crying and I’d just stay away till she needed me cause I didn’t know what to say.  Hard for her to get up the stairs, harder to get down drunk, but she wouldn’t listen.  That’s how it’s been and I didn’t know how to change it.\n\nWhen me and Noah finished reading I tucked him into bed with an extra blanket because it was sure getting cold.  He asked me “Will it snow, Uncle Marshall?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“I think it will.”\n\n“Well you may very well be right, let’s see in the morning. Goodnight Noah.”\n\n“Night Uncle Marshall.”\n\n“You just shout me if you wake up and need anything, okay?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nI remember thinking it was amazing, just last year he only knew a couple of words now listen to him.  I thought to myself he is growing up and I don’t know if I’m happy or sad about it, maybe both.\n\nWhen I went downstairs I started my nightly list.  I have it all written down so I don’t miss anything.  Lights out, doors and windows locked, chores done.  That sort of thing.\n \nAs I was near finished I saw Officer Winters again through the window, heading up the hill with a flashlight out.  I watched that light flickering through the trees all the way up, then right around that house. \n\nI imagined myself being there with him, me in a uniform with a badge and gun helping people.  You ever do that?  Imagine another life, still yourself but where things wound up different?  I get carried away doing it, daydreaming.  Too often I think.  Always have since I was little I can’t help it.  Must be watching too much TV that does it, that’s what Suzanne always said.  That was my sister, Noahs mom.\n\nThe rain was coming on when I saw the light working it’s way back down.  I felt the cold creeping into the house too so I pulled the curtains and fixed myself a coffee.\n\nMomma had long since passed out on her bed so I fitted her oxygen mask on her and took the empty bottle and glass downstairs.  Then I got myself wrapped up on the couch and watched some old movie.  I fell asleep right there but kept get woken up, wind or some other noise rattling the windows.\n\n*\n\nI went out walking the next afternoon, this would be yesterday.  momma had been up early, said her cough came on and she couldn’t shake it so I left Noah sitting in bed with her watching cartoons.  \n\nNow, being a little thick around the midsection and having a weak chest runs in our family.  Hell even Noah has asthma.  So I figured a few years back I should start exercising.  I usually walk a big loop out around town, down past the river.  I say river but it’s only about a foot deep and 10 across.  I come back along the main street after about 20 minutes. \n\nIsn’t much of a town I suppose, not anymore.  About a hundred different reasons have shrunk it down over the years.  People don’t stay.  Say there’s nothing here for them but I don’t understand that.  I think, especially in the fall, this is just about the most beautiful place in the world.  Red and gold leaves covering the place as far as you can see, looks and feels like a fairytale.  Maybe that’s just me.  \n\nNow though, in the cold and wet with the sky all gray, most of all you notice the empty houses.  Seems like every second home has gone quiet.  Hard to even remember the families that were there before.\n\nWhen I was getting near home I saw Mr Winters and another officer getting out of their vehicle.  I went over.  \n\nI heard the other cop saying “We are in the ass end of nowhere. What do you expect?”\n\nThen Officer Winters said “Can we help you Marshall?  Or are you just gonna stand there listenin?”\n\n“Sorry sheriff.”\n\n“I ain’t a sheriff.”\n\n“Ah yeah sorry.”\n\nI’m terrible at remembering that.  I just got it in my head that he is and I can’t shake it out. Lucky he was always so patient and didn’t get angry with me like other folk.\n\n“So what you guys doin?” I asked.  I didn’t like to interrupt but I also didn’t want to be accused of eavesdropping again.\n\nThe other cop rolled his eyes but Mr Winters answered while he was getting gear from the trunk.\n\n“Well Marshall, it’s like this.  I went up the hillside to that house last night to see what was what.  And I considered going in on my own.  Except this ain’t one of those detective shows you are always watching, this here is real life.  And seein as I didn’t want to fall through a floorboard in the dark and break my goddam legs, I devised an alternative course of action.  I called the only other officer within a hundred miles of this godforsaken town, that’s Rob here …”\n\n“Hey Marshall.”\n\n“Hey Rob.”\n\n“... and asked him if he would be so kind as to meet me here this very day.  Now I will go and search that house, with backup, in daylight.  Actin on common sense is not quite as excitin but does result in less broken bones.”\n\nI hadn’t recognised Rob at first.  We all met him once before last year when the sheriff was on vacation.  Rob had come to introduce himself which was very kind of him.\n\n“So Marshall, how’s that nephew of yours?” Rob asked, “He must be what … 3 now?”\n\n“Oh Noah he is good.  And yes sir he is 3 goin on 30.”\n\n“Ain’t that him playing in the middle of the road?”\n\n“Ah shoot yes it is.”\n\nI high tailed it up the street and gathered Noah up onto the porch.  He was saying he was just bored as anything so I got us a couple of drinks and we watched the sheriff and Rob head on up that hillside.\n\nIt was real quiet in the street as we sat there, felt as if everyone had decided to just stay in for the day.  Don’t think I even saw a bird in the sky, but we both thought we saw a few flakes of snow which Noah was very happy about.\n\nUp the hill Rob and Mr Winters had disappeared inside that house.  Was around then I realized that I hadn’t seen Mr Eggers that day.  He lived across from us and was usually out front tending his plants or working in his garage with the door open.  But he hadn’t been out on his porch that morning and he was always out there at that time.  He was a man of very regular habits and I’d never known him to break them.\n\nNow the two officers, they had been in that house a while, maybe 15 minutes.  My eyes kept straying back to Mr Eggers place because it was just so strange.  I was thinking I should go and knock his door to see if he was okay when I noticed it wasn’t even closed, it was just lying a couple of inches open.\n\nI sent Noah up to his bedroom and started to go over there when I saw Rob and Mr Winters reappear.  Rob bent over at the waist, looked like he was being sick.  Mr Winters was on his phone.  Both had their weapons out which I had never seen before.  They headed back down and when they got closer I saw they was both white as sheets.\n\nThe two of them went straight back to their vehicle and, since I figured I should tell them about Mr Eggers, I tagged along behind trying to catch up.  I heard bits and pieces of them talking on their phones.  \n\nRob said “...bare minimum of ten but it’s impossible to tell …” and I heard Mr Winters say “...everyone you can get. I have never seen anything like it…”.  \n\nIn between they talked to each other about how bad the weather coming tonight was.\n\nI caught up to them.\n\n“Mr Sheriff, sir?”\n\n“Not now Marshall.”\n\n“Mr Eggers door is lyin open and I ain’t seen him.  Not since yesterday mornin.”\n\nMr Winters looked at me then over at the Eggers house.\n\n“I’ll call back.” he said to the person on the phone and hung up.\n\nHe started walking toward Mr Eggers place and I followed.\n\n“What was in that house up there sheriff?  You both look white as sheets.”\n\n“Not now Marshall.”\n\n“Is Rob okay cause I thought I saw him being sick.  Was -”\n\n“Marshall.  Not now.”\n\nBehind us I could hear Rob still talking the whole time.  Mr Winters chapped at the door and it swung back a little.  He stepped inside.\n\n“Joseph?” he called out, that is Mr Eggers first name.  There was no reply.  “Marshall, ask Rob to come in here please and you wait at the door.”\n\nHe had his hand on his holster and sounded real serious so I did as he asked with my mouth shut.  The two of them went in together a minute later and I stood there on my own in the street feeling useless.  \n\nI heard them shouting on Mr Eggers and could see them moving through the window.  I remember the door was still open so I peered inside I couldn’t help myself.  Down the hallway I could see into the kitchen at the back.  The window was smashed and I saw broken glass.  There were dark patches on the floor.\n\nMr Winters reappeared in the hall and I shrunk back pretending I wasn’t doing nothing.\n\n“Get out of here Marshall.  Go check on Noah and your mom.  Quickly now.”\n\nI didn’t argue.  On the way back home I found myself shaking a little and not just from the cold.  Night always comes quick in the winter and yesterday was no exception.  What light we had left was barely getting through the clouds.  \n\nIt had gone quiet again.  That heavy silence like I was being watched.  \n\nMy eyes were drawn to the darkest places beneath the trees, the pitch black out of the moonlight.  I had slowed to a stop and it felt like the world had too.  I stared.  \n\nThere was something there I was sure of it.  Still and silent in the dark but there was something there.\n\nThen I snapped out of it and ran.\n\nWhen I got in our front door I was soaked in a cold sweat from head to toe.  I didn’t really know what to do so I shouted momma and Noah and started checking locks on doors and windows.\n\n“Marshall what the hell are you doing?” momma was struggling down the stairs with Noah behind her, “Whats going on?”\n\n“Somethin bad is happenin I don’t know what.  Mr Eggers is missing I think and Mr Winters found something up at that house that shook them up terrible.”\n\nAs I was answering her I saw marks on the outside of the window.  Scratches on the glass and wooden frame.  They hadn’t been there the day before.  I stood there still for a second, just staring.\n\n“Marshall, what nonsense are you spoutin?  Where’s Joseph?”\n\nI was thinking about Mr Eggers broken window.  I thought about noises waking me up in the night.  Then I just stopped thinking about it because I started shaking again and I couldn’t stop.\n\nOnce I got everything locked I calmed myself down and explained it all to her as best I could.  While we were talking I looked out and saw Mr Winters coming back to our door.  In the distance behind him I could see Rob at another door.\n\n“You got your shotgun, Millie?” he asked when he came in.\n\n“Course I do.  Ain’t used it for near twenty years though.  You plannin to elaborate?”\n\n“Got some help comin but I don’t think tonight.  We got to get through tonight.”\n\n“You ain’t answerin me.”\n\n“You can stay locked in here, I won’t start forcing people to move that would be a whole other set of problems.  But if you don’t feel safe then some folk are gathering with me and Rob in the town hall, you are all more than welcome.”\n\n“Safe? What in the f-”\n\n“I’m not going talk details with anyone, Millie.  I am certain it will not be of help.  People are missing and I believe there is still danger to others.  That’s all I’ll say.”\n\nAs he was talking his eyes drifted back up to that old house and then locked in place.\n\n“What is it sheriff?” I asked.\n\nHe didn’t move, didn’t take his eyes off that house.  I don’t know what he saw but it had his attention that’s for sure.\n\n“Lock your door.” he said, then he called for Rob and they headed straight back up there. They were moving quicker this time and had their guns drawn along with their flashlights.  Not even in my imagination did I want to go with them. \n\nWhen they were both up there they stopped, one at either side of the front door.  I thought I heard Mr Winters shout something but with the wind picking up I couldn’t make it out.  Then they went in fast, one after the other.  \n\nI had went out a few steps from our porch, straining my eyes and ears to see or hear what little I could.  The wind whipped at my clothes and I felt the first touch of rain.\n\nSomeone screamed.  \n\nIt came from the far end of the street, not the hillside.  Sounded like a woman.  I looked down there but I didn’t see anyone.  So I walked out a little further, trying to ignore my heart rattling in my chest.  \n\nThen I saw her.  I think it was Mrs Edmonson, though I can't be certain.  She staggered out of her door then fell to one knee.  \n\nI had just started down the street when something else came out the house behind her.  It snatched her up without a sound, dragging her back in there like she was a rag doll.\n\nI have never been so scared in my life.  I can’t even describe it, what I saw.  The size of a man, maybe a little smaller.  Moving low to the ground, always out of the light.  \n\nIt was too much for me.  I was so frozen in place I’m not sure I was even breathing.  \n\nI caught movement out the corner of my eye, something fast between the trees.  Close, maybe 30 feet away.\n\n“Whats wrong Uncle Marshall?”\n\n“Noah! Sweet Jesus you scared the life outta me. Get back in the house come on.”\n\n“What’s wrong?”\n\n“Go go go, into the house.”\n\nI grabbed him and rushed back in, so quick I forgot to lock the door.\n\nWe heard a gun fire somewhere down the street and Noahs eyes went wide.  Could hear people shouting too.  Then more shots but this time they sounded like they were from up the hill.\n\nI started to panic and I couldn’t calm myself.  Momma was talking but I couldn’t hear her voice, just a rushing in my ears and I was hot all over.  \n\nI started thinking about my sister of all things.  You ever get that?  Something stuck in your head and you can’t shake it, looping over and over like a broken machine trying to start.  A few weeks before she passed she told me “Only takes a moment for everything to change.  Everything to be taken away.  You don’t know what your world will be tomorrow.”  I didn’t know what to say to her so I just sat there, holding her hand.\n\nI had started repeating those words over and over under my breath and it took Noah pulling on my arm to shake me out of it.  My momma was shouting at me and I felt like I was going to vomit.\n\nWhen I managed to clear my head I told her I wanted to go to the town hall but she wouldn’t have it.  She said there was no way she could walk that far or stay there all night.  The two of us were shouting at each other and Noah was getting upset.\n\nThe front door slammed open behind us and we all jumped near out of our skin.  Mr Winters was in the doorway, half carrying Rob who was barely conscious by his side.\n\nI remember he said “Need your help.” and there was a tremor in his voice I had never heard before.  His face was shining with sweat and streaked with blood.\n\nThey stumbled forward together and Rob cried out.  Mr Winters swung him down onto the floor and Jesus Christ that poor boy was torn to pieces.  \n\nI seen people hurt before.  Car accident when I was a boy, dog bite a few years back.  But I have never seen anything close to what I saw that night.  I can’t even imagine what could have done that to him.  \n\nThere must have been a dozen strips torn out of his chest alone.  Blood was pooling on the floor faster than you would believe.\n\n“What done that to him? My -”\n\n“I don’t know, Marshall.”\n\n“But what -”\n\n“Not now Marshall!  Get me water, towels, bandages if you can.”\n\nI ran to get them as quick as I could but I was shaking again and kept dropping stuff.  When I got back Rob was gasping for breath, loud like a drowning man just pulled from the water.  His face was ghostly pale. \n\nI knelt beside them with the water and that’s when I saw his left arm.  Hanging in his torn shirt sleeve, hand stripped away at the wrist with nothing left but broken bone all white and jagged.  I had to turn away as I was nearly sick. \n\nThere was so much noise, Noah crying in the next room and momma trying to quiet him.  I was muttering again under my breath and I couldn’t seem to stop.  Mr Winters was talking to Rob telling him to stay conscious and trying to press his hands on wounds but there were too many and too much blood.  \n\nRob was wanting to speak but between his ragged breaths and the wind from outside the words got lost.\n\nThen nothing.\n\nIt was sudden.  He stopped breathing, stopped moving.  So quick it shocked us all into silence. Mr Winters slumped back, bandages half unrolled in his hands.  He seemed to be fighting with himself for a second before realizing it was hopeless.\n\nA man had died right there on our hall floor.  Where Noah was playing with his toy truck that morning.  And we barely even knew him.\n\nIt all becomes a blur after that.  The hours mixed up into just the bits and pieces I remember.\n\nMomma wouldn’t go and I couldn’t make her.  She just kept saying “Take Noah and get out of here.” and she wouldn’t listen she just wouldn’t.\n\nNoah being pressed in to my arms and he started screaming for her when she pushed me back out of that door, clinging on so tight he was hurting me.\n\nMr Winters pulling my arm saying we couldn’t wait any longer.\n\nI saw shadows moving in the trees, shadows the size of people but they didn’t move like people.\n\nThere were voices shouting on Mr Winters.  I saw the big main door of the town hall was open with light spilling out and people going in.\n\nA car at end of road swerved wildly and overturned.  Another was half in the street with the drivers window smashed and no-one inside.\n\nThen we were running to the hall, me carrying Noah, rain stinging cold and getting in my eyes.  Mr Winters had wanted to get to his car first but it was sitting in the dark of the trees and he didn’t think we could make it.  I heard gunfire again but I didn’t know where from.\n\nWe went inside the hall.  I saw Miss Jacobsen there already, she was holding her arm as if it was hurt.  I think there were about 10 of us there but I’m guessing.  I can’t even remember who.  Just scared faces and I was one of them, people who couldn’t do nothing, trying to block up windows and doors and a couple holding weapons they hadn’t looked at never mind used in years.\n\nI was sucking in every breath like it was my last and I sunk to the floor still holding Noah.  He was crying and hiding his face in my chest.  A window smashed and people were screaming again.  Guns firing deafening loud in the hall and everytime Noahs body shook in my arms.  \n\nI wanted to run but there was nowhere to go.  I saw people dragged out through the windows, wide eyed and fighting and crying for help.  I don’t know what took them.  I only saw flashes, clawed hands like dark wood, fast and hissing as they moved, never in the light.  There was blood on the walls where people had been pulled out.  I saw in the windowframe closest to me a bloody fingernail sticking up in the wood.  Through the smashed glass I could see the rain coming down in sheets and movement in the dark.  Dozens of shapes, too fast to follow.\n\nI remember saying “My mom.”\n\n“She didn’t make it Marshall.” Mr Winters was beside me again, his face was bleeding and he was loading his gun.  I think we were the only ones left but I can’t be certain.\n\n“Did you see her?” my voice was trembling, “Because you don’t know, you don’t she could-”\n\n“She didn’t make it.”\n\nAnd his eyes begged me to stop asking and I knew why.\n\nThen he was pulling me to my feet and telling me to run.\n\n“What are we gonna do?” I said, “How are we gonna get out of here?”\n\n“You’re gonna take Noah and run, Marshall.  The back road across the river.”\n\n“Christ it’s raining like ice, must be 20 miles and-”\n\nI never got to finish because he pushed me hard in the back and told me to start running.\n\nThe cold hit me.  Noah cried out and I tried to wrap my arms further round his back to keep the worst of the wind off him.  I was frozen on the spot for a second, still not knowing what to do.  Then another gunshot went off and I heard movement in the trees.  So I done what I was told and ran. \n\nNoah kept saying my name over and over, “Marshall Marshall Marshall” and I didn’t know how to calm him as I couldn’t even calm myself.  Could hardly get my breath to answer him.\n\nI ran, between trees then through the shallowest part of the river, stumbling and crying like a baby myself.  I heard a gun fire for the last time and close behind us something fell in the dark.\n\nI told Noah not to look, just close his eyes and hold on as tight as he could.  I thought any second we would be caught, those hands would grab us both and pull us down and there would be nothing I could do.\n\nI fell more than once, so panicked I could hardly get my feet under me.  I just tried to turn it all off and keep going.  The pain, cold, exhaustion.  It didn't take long before I couldn’t feel my arms or legs from the cold so at least they didn’t hurt much more.\n\nWanted to stop and shelter from the rain, even for a moment.  Try to get my breath.  But I kept hearing things behind us and knew we couldn’t stop.  Noah was crying that he was so cold and shaking against me and I didn’t know what to do.\n\nI thought of my sister telling me to look after him.  Thought of my mother.  It was all they ever asked of me and I was trying but I didn’t know how.\n\nHours must of passed.  Noah had stopped crying an shaking and I didn’t know for how long, I had been almost out on my feet.  I shook him, tried to make him speak or even cry or anything, anything at all.  \n\nI stopped because there was no choice left and he was so cold and it was so dark I couldn’t even tell if he was breathing.  I took off some of my own clothes and put them round him but everything was soaked and freezing and I couldn’t stop.  \n\nDo you understand?  I thought I heard those sounds behind us again and I picked him back up and started running and I didn’t know what to do.  I told him, look Noah it’s snowing.  Look, you were right.  But he didn’t answer me.    He didn’t answer and I couldn’t feel him breathing and I didn’t know what to do.\n\nI kept running but it was too late.\n\n*\n\nWe made it here at daybreak, just as the sun was coming up through the mist.  The world all white between the black of the trees and it could have been a dream but for the weight in my arms.\n\nCouple of townsfolk found us on the road in.  They thought I didn’t want to let him go and I didn’t but it was really cause I couldn’t move my arms.  Cold and tired had locked up just about every muscle I had.\n\nI’m in the house of one of the locals here who recognised us.  They got a doctor here, dragged out of his bed to come over.  He asked me what in Gods name was going on?  The police came through here last night, he said, going at a hell of a speed and haven’t come back down.  And had I seen Officer Winters?  Because one of their neighbors is missing.\n\nI tried telling them the truth and they looked at me like I was crazy.  I don’t know what else to say.\n\nI keep imagining I hear Noah crying.  That he wakes up and calls my name.  Like I saved him.  I keep on imagining it no matter how I try to stop.\n\nOnly been two days since everything was normal.  Two days and it’s all changed, everyone I had has been taken away.\n\nWonder what the world will be tomorrow.",

The rudimentary structure was able to generate a maximum temperature of 250 degrees, resulting in a gradual death from hyperthermia. Best estimates suggest that death took 15-20 hours from the onset of heat to occur. \n\nAll five fingers on Barbara Balisha’s right hand had been recently severed. The wounds had been cauterized poorly, but the procedure was sufficient enough to prevent a level of blood loss that might have rendered unconsciousness. \n\nThe destruction of all 32 teeth was apparently self-inflicted. Scratch marks indicate that, in desperation, Barbara Balisha attempted to chew through the metal bars in her desire to escape the pain generated by the makeshift oven. \n\nHer attempts to escape were unsuccessful.\n\nBarbara Belisha was three months pregnant at the time of her death.\n\n**Notes:** Evan Belisha (34 years old) led Elm Grove Police to the warehouse where he and his wife had been held in cages. The scene was found to be as he described it, including Barbara’s fingers in and around a cup ten feet from the cage where she died. \n\nThe perpetrator, presumed to be the same person involved in a series of extreme Elm Grove crimes, remains unknown. \n\nThe Elm Grove Police Department has no suspects. \n\nUpon seeing his dead wife, Evan Belisha apprehended an EGPD officer’s service weapon and aimed it at his own head. \n\nThe bullet resulted in a lower brain injury. Evan Belisha remains paralyzed in all four limbs, but is still conscious. Since the incident, he has been less cooperative with EGPD. In lieu of a dialogue, he has chosen to repeat the same information ad infinitum, sharing the same phrase over and over:\n\n“He didn’t want to kill us. He wanted us to beg for a death we couldn’t have. He won, we lost.” \n\n-----------------\n\n\n[FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n[Listen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ?view_as=subscriber)",

        "text": "Hi Reddit, as you can see the topic of this subreddit is about creepy stuff and being a priest for the last 20 years was filled with these kinds of stuff and I have to get it out of my chest.\n\n•May 16, 2011•\n\nI was already a priest for ten years at that time and I was made an exorcist priest, I've had exorcised many people and it's not like in the movies where the ritual of exorcism are exaggerated, normally these ritual of exorcism is lighter than what you'd expect but some do get very bad that they are similar to what happens in the movies but those are the most extreme of all circumstances which I have rarely seen but those are not the ones that terrified me the most.\n\nI was doing the Divine Liturgy on a Sunday afternoon and there was nothing unusual with the day, my family, my wife, my children, and my parishioners all seem to be fine like usual, there is no drama or issues surrounding my congregation but I was still unaware of what was to come next.\n\nThe four hour liturgy was finished and I headed back to the sacristy when a teenage boy had approached me because he wanted to confess his sins and being the spiritual father of my parishioners I agreed to grant him the sacrament of confession. The boy looked depressed and horrified, his movements speak of wariness and he often looks back as if he's looking out for someone\n\nI wouldn't tell you the details of his confession due to the seal of confession but there was one thing he told me about and it's that he has been seeing a tall man in black suit for these past 2 weeks, I asked him what does his face look like and the boy was silent, he did not answer immediately and then he spoke softly to me, \"father he has no face.\" At first I was confused and asked the boy if he's joking.\n\nHe looked me in the eye and I said, \"father, I am not joking, I summoned him and he's not coming after me, help me\", I was still confused about it and asked him about the summoning. He answered me straight with an answer that today I find it horrifying, \"father, I summoned him because I want to have a friend like him because I have no friends\".\n\n\nI asked him about how he summoned this faceless man, I already know that he has already interacted with demonic elements and that this is a case of demonic oppression but I still wanted to ask him about it because of all the years in my experience I have not encountered something like what the boy is describing.\n\nI will quote the best from my memory but what he said was like this:\n\n\"Go into the mirror and chant Slender Man for thirteen times, turn the lights off and on for eight times and turn around, you'll see him but he'll disappear quickly. Ever since that day I kept seeing him everywhere except when I go near this church\"\n\nI told him to return the next Sunday and I'll give him deliverance but I told him not to go outside often and I'll visit him from time to time.\n\nA week passed and I did not see him in my church and I wondered where he went but I kept on with the liturgy and returned home after, an hour later two cops knocked on my door and asked me about the boy, I told them that I did not see him and shared a few details of out interaction last Sunday and they left.\n\nThe following week was uneventful and 2 weeks passed, news spread around town about a dead body belonging to a teenager. The police reported that the body was found hanging on a tree with strange symbols carved around the skin.\n\nThey added that the body was releasing black liquid and the official autopsy reported that their are no internal organs found inside. I looked into the newspapers and I recognized the face, it was the boy that confessed to me, I was saddened and I attended the boy's funeral. I did not know much about the thing that took the boy back then but I was determined to find out what that thing is.\n\n•April 23, 2013•\n\nTwo years have already passed since the boy's disappearance I met a young woman by the name of Elizabeth, she told me that she was a recent convert to Catholicism from occultism.\n\nBy that time I already knew a lot more about the creature that took the boy and I was shocked to know that Elizabeth knows about this thing and was even more knowledgeable than me about it but I did not really put my mind into it and welcomed her in my congregation, she was an energetic parishioner that often participates in the liturgy.\n\nShe was the hiking loving type, she loves hiking in the mountains with friends and she's the one to not miss a liturgy before going hiking, a very good and healthy individual that inspires many of my young parishioners to explore nature and not just be stuck in their computer screens, she's very helpful and very active in our parish and she does all this without asking for payment.\n\nI asked her once about why she does this and offered to pay her for her services but she refused and told me that it was reparations for her past life of being involved with the occult, she confesses often and it was a good sign of change\n\nUntil one day she came knocking on my house at 8:00 PM asking me to let her in, she was in a panic and I immediately let her in and my wife gave her water and calmed her down, she was breathing heavily and she has a few scratches on her arms and parts of her clothing was ripped by either the branches of whatever that's come after her\n\nWe sat her down on the sofa and asked her about what she saw and she told us about a moving tree that is after her, I was puzzled and confused as to why a tree would move and chase her unless she's hallucinating but she swore to me that what she told me is true, I listened to what she has to say.\n\nShe told us about walking in the woods as she was on her way home from her hike but the night came fast and it was dark when she was walking alone in the woods, she suddenly saw strange symbols carved on the trees and she felt the feeling of being watched.\n\nShe told me about hearing the whisper, \"do you think you can turn away from us?\" In the wind and she looked around the area, she saw a moving creature with branching arms rushing towards her and she ran as fast as she can.\n\nShe ran until she saw the road leading to my house and ran in the direction of my house until she arrived at my house in a panic, we tried our best to comfort her and offered her to rest in our house for the night which she agreed to and in the morning I dropped her off at her house.\n\nOne night I received a call from her asking me to go to her house because she was seeing a strange looking creature outside her house, it was pure black as she described and I immediately rushed to my room to get my stuff\n\nI took a gun, a rosary, a bottle of holy water, and a crucifix necklace with me and rushed off to go outside, I told my wife to stay at home with the kids while I go and check on Elizabeth\n\nHer house was a fifteen minute drive from mine but I pushed on the pedal and I arrived there ten minutes after, I noticed that the street light was turned off and her house's door was wide open, I had a bad feeling about it and I reached for my weapon and aimed it at the door as I walk slowly towards it\n\nI called out, \"Elizabeth!\", A scream from the upper floor was heard and I immediately rushed to it with weapon in hand, I arrived at the scene with a creature in pure black was grabbing a hold of her neck, I shot it in the head from behind and blood spilled from it.\n\nThe creature then turned it's face towards me and what I saw was a blank white head with no features, it's branching arms was all over the room and it spoke, \"your presence disgust me.\"\n\nI spoke back, \"let go of her.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I will obey a mere human like you? I know your weaknesses and sins, and I can spread it around the world to make you fall\" it spat back, \"one human for my thirst for blood and flesh and one soul to be damned, can't you priests leave us alone?\"\n\nI crossed myself and grabbed a rosary from my pockets and started praying the Hail Mary, in a quick reaction it tried to swat me away but I evaded it quickly, \"oh stop! Your prayers annoy me more than your entire kind!\" It spoke\n\n\"Release her demon\" I spoke back to it and it looked at her, it moved it's arms and wrapped around her neck, I quickly used the Holy Water against it and it twitched in agony and pain, I went for the thing and whipped it with the rosary and it let go of Elizabeth, and disappeared.\n\nI quickly went for Elizabeth and held her up, she was unconscious so I carried her off to my truck and drove back to my house but it wasn't gonna be an easy ride like I thought, the creature doesn't give up and tried to take us into disaster\n\nIt appeared in the middle of the road in front of us and I immediately stopped, I did the sign of the cross and pushed on the pedal, my truck went off in crazy speed and it disappeared as soon as my truck came near to it.\n\nWe arrive home and my wife was worried, we took Elizabeth to the hospital and told them a different story as they wouldn't believe what I saw in her house, the police investigated and concluded that a robber broke into her house and tried to kill her\n\nElizabeth was on a ten day coma and I anointed her head with oil as the sacrament of anointing the sick, she recovered pretty quickly and started to live with us on our house due to the trauma, until now Elizabeth lives with us and we became like a family to her.\n\nThat's all I can tell you right now as I am now heading in head, I'll post more of my experiences in the next coming days but I have to leave it here right now as I am getting sleepy and drained. Good night.",

It was a peaceful evening, and the only sound that could be heard was the gentle rustling of the trees in the wind.\n\nJohn and his wife, Sarah, had just moved to the countryside a few weeks ago. They had been looking for a place to start a new life, and the countryside seemed like the perfect place. They had found a small house on the edge of a forest, and it was the perfect place to call home.\n\nJohn and Sarah had been married for a few years, and they were very much in love. They had been through a lot together, and they were looking forward to starting a new life in the countryside.\n\nLittle did they know, however, that their new home was not as peaceful as it seemed. For the past few nights, John had been hearing strange noises coming from the forest. He had tried to ignore them, but they kept getting louder and more frequent.\n\nOne night, John decided to investigate. He grabbed a flashlight and ventured into the forest. As he walked, he noticed that the trees seemed to be swaying in a strange way, as if they were being pushed by an invisible force. He also noticed that the air seemed to be charged with electricity, and he could feel a strange energy in the air.\n\nJohn continued to walk until he came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a large stone circle. He had never seen anything like it before, and he was filled with a sense of dread. He knew that something was not right.\n\nSuddenly, a figure appeared in the center of the circle. It was a woman, and she was wearing a long white dress. She had long, dark hair and her eyes were glowing with an eerie light. She seemed to be looking right at John, and he felt a chill run down his spine.\n\nThe woman spoke in a strange language, and John could not understand her. He was about to turn and run when she suddenly stopped speaking and pointed at him. She said something in a language he could not understand, and then she vanished.\n\nJohn was filled with fear, but he knew he had to find out what was going on. He decided to return to the stone circle every night, and eventually he began to understand the strange language the woman spoke.\n\nHe soon realized that the woman was a spirit, and she was trying to tell him something. She was warning him of a great danger that was coming to the countryside. She said that an evil force was coming, and it would bring destruction and chaos.\n\nJohn was terrified, but he knew he had to do something. He decided to gather a group of people from the village and form a plan to protect the countryside. He and his group of brave warriors set out to fight the evil force, and after a long and difficult battle, they were able to defeat it.\n\nJohn and Sarah were able to return to their peaceful life in the countryside, and they never forgot the strange paranormal experience they had encountered. They knew that the spirit had been trying to warn them of the danger, and they were forever grateful for her help",

        "text": "Valentine's Day used to be a challenging day for me as a long term single individual. Each year, it served as a stark reminder of my solitude.\n\nHowever, this year, I opted for a new approach. I learned about a Valentine's Day gathering for singles occurring in my area and decided to check it out. \n\nUpon arriving at the event, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount  of attendees. A diverse group of singles all seeking romance. I engaged in conversations with a few individuals, but none of them piqued my interest.\n\nAs the night wore on, I began to feel more and more like an outsider. It seemed as though everyone was hitting it off, except for me. Then, I spotted her. She was standing alone in the corner, much like I was. I approached her and initiated a conversation.\n\nWe hit it off instantly, and before I knew it, the night had flown by. As the gathering drew to a close, we exchanged contact information and arranged to meet up for a second date.\"\n\nOur second date was even better than the first. We went out to a nice restaurant and had a great time talking and laughing. She was smart, funny, and beautiful. I felt like I had finally found someone I could really connect with.\n\nAfter dinner, we went back to her place. We talked some more, and then things started to get intimate. It was passionate and intense, and we were both really into it.\n\nBut then something strange happened. She started acting a little off, like she was someone else. She was saying things that didn't make sense, and her voice even sounded different.\n\nI tried to shake it off and continue, but it just got weirder and weirder. Eventually, I realized that this wasn't the woman I had gone out with. It was like she had been possessed by something.\n\nI tried to leave, but the door wouldn't open. It was like we were trapped in there together. She kept getting more and more aggressive, and I knew I had to do something.\n\nI managed to break a window and climb out. As I ran away, I could hear her screaming behind me. I didn't look back until I was far enough away that I knew she couldn't follow me.\n\nWhen I finally looked back, I saw her standing in the window, staring at me with eyes that weren't her own. I knew then that I had narrowly escaped a truly terrifying Valentine's Day.\n\nThe following days after my terrifying encounter with my possessed date, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that lingered within me. I tried to move on and forget about what happened, but I couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the real woman I had met.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I found myself feeling increasingly paranoid. I started noticing strange occurrences happening around me, things that couldn't be explained logically. Objects moved by themselves, doors would creak open and close on their own, and I would hear whispers and strange noises in the middle of the night.\n\nOne night, I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep when I heard a faint tapping at my window. At first, I thought it was just a tree branch, but then it started getting louder and more persistent. I got up and cautiously approached the window, only to be greeted by a chilling sight. There, standing on my front lawn, was my possessed date. Her eyes were pitch-black, and she had a twisted smile on her face.\n\nI quickly closed the curtains and retreated back to my bed, feeling more terrified than ever before. I couldn't explain what was happening to me, but I knew that I was in grave danger.\n\nThe next day, I decided to seek help from a spiritual medium. She performed a cleansing ritual on me, and I finally found some relief from the strange occurrences that had been happening around me. She explained that my date had been possessed by a powerful and malevolent spirit that was attracted to my loneliness and vulnerability.",

        "text": "Lightning came down from the sky, hitting the man standing in the street directly in the center of his head. His wife and children started screaming from the sidewalk a few feet away, his young toddler putting out her hands towards her father and yelling, “Dada! Dada!” The mother was carrying the toddler, and her eyes were animalistic and uncomprehending as she looked at the smoking body in the street. The six-year-old son stood next to the mother, not saying or doing anything, his eyes simply wide and shell-shocked as he kept staring at his father’s remains.\n\nThe sound of pouring rain and heavy thunder gave the world a muffling effect. All I could smell was charred meat from the father’s body mixing with springtime flowers and rainstorms. The combination was absolutely nauseating. I thought I might throw up if I had to smell that burning body smell for a moment longer.\n\nAs if in slow motion, I saw the body of the father fall to its knees, its arms hanging limply by its sides, its face a blackened, smoking mask of fused skin and blood. The body stayed there, looking like it was praying, then mercifully fell face-first onto the pavement. I was happy I didn’t have to see that face anymore.\n\nHis wife immediately put down the toddler, who was wailing, then instinctually ran into the road without looking. I was on the same side of the road as her and started sprinting down the sidewalk towards the family. As she stepped out into the road, a tractor-trailer that had been coming around the corner tried to stop, seeing a man’s body in the road, but the mass of the vehicle was far too great to stop at such a short distance. The driver twisted the wheel and, with a cacophony of shrieking metal, it began to flip. Within a fraction of a second, both the wife and the husband had disappeared from view under the ripping, shredding metal of the trailer. Sparks flew in every direction as my ears rang from all the noise. \n\nI had reached the kids and pulled them back from the sidewalk, forcing them onto the lawn directly behind it as they both put their arms out and began screaming.\n\nI don’t know what the tractor-trailer had been carrying, but it immediately began to catch fire, explosions rocking the street as I dragged the kids to the nearest house and got them safely inside. The resident of the house came running downstairs and I screamed at them to call the police.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLater that day, I was back home. I took a hot shower and tried to forget what I had seen. It had all gone terribly wrong. I had wanted them dead, but for them to die in such a graphic way in front of their own kids seemed like overkill. I dried off and dressed for the ritual, entering the basement and taking out the spellbook, “The Shadows of Solomon.”\n\nIt had been passed down within my family for countless centuries. Very few people even knew of its existence. As I took it out of the safe, I felt the leathery, black cover, made of human skin. I opened the book, and its pages shone out with their radiant whiteness. I marveled at how the book never seemed to age, the pages never drying out or cracking, the cover never needing any maintenance. It was as if it were a living thing that could heal itself. I had never seen another book quite like it.\n\nI did the ritual to bring the jinn back, drawing the pentagram with human blood and chanting the proper words in Aramaic. The stuffy basement seemed to open up into something the size of a football field as the consciousness of the jinn entered. At first, it looked like a mist was gathering in front of me, directly outside the safety of the star. But it wasn’t a mist at all, I knew- it was smokeless fire, a kind that most people could never see unless the jinn allowed it.\n\n“Awar,” I said, calling the name of the jinn, and he answered.\n\n“I am here, daughter,” he said, and his body solidified. He looked like a man and a snake had merged, floating above the ground. He had the body of a man, with legs and arms, but his skin had scales, and his eyes and nose were those of a snake. He had countless serrated teeth, and three bone-white horns extending out of his forehead.\n\n“That was quite a mess today, wasn’t it?” I asked. He simply smiled, an ear-to-ear grin that showed his dozens of shark-like teeth.\n\n“What is your next wish, *daughter of Eve*?” he said, his voice dripping with condescension and arrogance. “I have eliminated the ones your husband was cheating on you with, the neighbors of sickness. Should I now eliminate the source of the sickness, as well?” I knew you had to be very literal when speaking with jinn. If I said yes, for all I knew, he could use that interpretation to get rid of me, if he could twist the meaning somehow to make me the source of sickness. I had known for quite a while my husband was having threesomes with the neighbors. I could never look at him the same- not only was he cheating, but he was clearly not even straight. How could I have married such a man? It made me sick to my stomach to think about it, even now. And it was certainly no wonder we had such problems in our marriage. I knew he was the cause of all the problems.\n\n“I wish for you to kill my husband, without me being in any way a suspect to the police or dying as a result of whatever kills him,” I said. The jinn smiled, then his body dissipated back into a fog-like substance. The room returned to a normal basement. I was just a naked woman sitting in the middle of a bloody star in an almost totally bare basement now. Looking out the basement window, I saw a small, smooth face staring in at me. My heart leaped in my chest, but as soon as I blinked, the face was gone.\n\n“What the hell was that?” I wondered to myself. Then I heard my husband’s car pulling into the driveway and slamming the door. Seconds later, he was yelling upstairs.\n\n“Mary?” he said. He sounded as if he were crying. “Did you hear about what happened to the Palmers?” \n\nI quickly grabbed a bucket of water, washing the blood off the basement floor and allowing it to flow down a drain in the center of the room. I was just finishing cleaning up as he came down the stairs.\n\n“Mary, what are you doing down here?” he asked. I just shook my head.\n\n“Looking for something I lost,” I said quickly, and we went back upstairs. My husband, John, kept crying about the deaths. He had no idea that I knew about him cheating on me with them, however. I played the part of a supportive wife, hugging him and reassuring him.\n\n“So where are the kids going?” I asked, referring to the toddler and the six-year-old boy, the two Palmer children. John shrugged.\n\n“Luke and Jenna have an aunt and uncle a couple streets down,” he said. “They’re going to stay with them for a while.” Then I heard a soft sob from behind me.\n\nI looked back and saw the six-year-old standing there, a huge revolver in his tiny hands. He was pointing it directly at me. I froze, a wave of anxiety going through me.\n\n“Hey, now, Luke,” John said, walking towards the little boy, “put down the gun.” Luke shook his head, saying nothing. He wouldn’t even look at John. His eyes only focused on me.\n\n“She killed my parents,” he said in a small voice. John shook his head.\n\n“No, buddy, I’m sorry, but a truck killed your parents, and that was a freak accident,” John said. He put his hands up. “Please, just put down the gun and we can talk about this, OK?” He kept inching closer, then lunged for it. Luke panicked and fired a shot, which hit John directly in the center of his chest. My ears were ringing still, but I could hear John coughing up blood, the sound of fluid dripping out of his body and landing on the ground, before he collapsed.\n\nI stared down the sidewalk at Luke, putting my hands up.\n\n“We both know what you did,” Luke said, and fired. Everything went black.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up later, the beeping of hospital equipment all around me. I tried to move, but I couldn’t feel anything. My face felt flushed and hot. I turned my head and saw a nurse coming into the room. She stopped suddenly, her eyes widening.\n\n“Oh, you’re awake!” she said. I nodded. My mouth was so dry. The nurse ran out and got me some ice chips to suck on and soon, a doctor came in to talk to me.\n\n“I’m sorry, Mary,” he said, “but the bullet hit you in the spine. You are paralyzed.” I began to cry. “Also, your husband died as a result of the injury. He didn’t even make it into surgery.” The doctor shook his head sadly. “A terrible thing, really. The whole thing is just so sad.” I turned away from him, looking out the hospital window.\n\nI saw the jinn Awar there, his snake-like eyes staring in at me, his mouth a lunatic grin of pure delight. I saw him mouth the words to me:\n\n“Only one more wish for you, daughter of Eve.”",

        "text": "Such beauty. Yes, I know, I was just a hunter, yet, I always found myself in complete awe in front of nature. Sometimes, I could forget the hunting to focus on the exploring, after all, I was living near a forest that fueled my curiosity. The fresh air, the flora, the greenery and the forest sounds — which I like to call the nature's song — constituted a small part of the many things I loved about our dear planet. One day however, the exploration went too far and dire consequences followed.\n\nIt was two years ago on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. My dog Mace, a weimaraner, and myself followed the trail of an elusive deer fawn that kept on escaping us since noon. Its behavior seemed unnatural, as if it toyed with us and wanted us to understand that we could catch it. This in return fueled my resolve, with an anger that reached new heights at each of its escapes. Sunset was fast approaching when Mace suddenly dashed in a direction that was off the deer fawn's trail, but I quickly followed, trusting my dog's sharp instincts. A mix of disappointment, surprise and panic overwhelmed me when I set my eyes on the strange scenery. Mace fed on something fleshy that seemed carefully placed in front of an occult altar covered with bizarre symbols representing diverse animals. I sensed danger.\n\nOut of a nearby bush, the deer fawn emerged and I swiftly hid behind a tree, determined to seize the opportunity of ending this once for all. I peeked, clenching my rifle, ready to strike at the right moment. The deer ignored Mace, walked behind the altar and disappeared for a few seconds, but my eyes almost popped out of the sockets when I saw a tiger cub emerge from the other side. Either to protect Mace or to uncover the mystery behind all that, I immediately shot the tiger cub, knowing that they are born blind and depend on adult tigers for protection. The cub just slumped and Mace seemed to regain his senses as he lift his head up. I approached and saw the tiger lying on the ground unconscious and the altar mysteriously glowing in red. \n\nSomething ominous seemed to come our way due to the bizarre encounter, so I rapidly put the cub in a game bag and left the place before something else happened. Long was the walk home after hunting so deep in the forest, but we arrived at my brick cabin during the evening without any issues. A false sense of insecurity that preceeded the tsunami of terror awaiting for us in the dark hours. I put the game bag on a table, ready to have a little rest after almost a whole day of hunting when suddenly:\n\n\"Spen—cer.\" I heard, coming from the bag. The faint, agonizing voice of a female human being. \"Spencer, Spen—cer.\" I could not believe my ears. \n\nI crept towards the bag, ignoring the dread and opened it. I almost fell backwards when I saw that the tiger cub had transformed into a snake, agonizing on my table and calling my name. \n\n\"You— not staying— alive.\" It said, before it— laughed, as disturbing as it may seem. \n\nMace started barking at something lurking in the shadows outside. I went to a window and peeked to see many animals, from bears to packs of wolves, roaming around the cabin. I retrieved my rifle when I heard other beasts making their way on the cabin's roof until the thing on the table captured my attention once again. \n\n\"Spencer.\" It called and I looked at it, then speaking to me as the deer fawn. \n\n\"What's this? What are you?\" I questioned, aiming at the entity, but Mace jumped in front of it, growling at me, something he never did. \n\n\"I know— what you did— during the war.\" The entity said as I lowered my rifle in disbelief. \"You must— pay.\" It added. \n\nAt that instant, I heard a heavy beast charging towards the cabin while I trembled, waiting for the animal to just bring the habitat down. The beast hit the wall and shook the entire cabin, before I heard it retreating to prepare for its next attack. All the other beasts outside started making their respective and distinctive noises. It seemed that the whole fauna of the forest came after me for a deadly showdown. \n\n\"What do you want? WHAT DO YOU WANT?\" I asked. \n\n\"Whukeleto already— bargained with me.\" The entity responded as the heavy strong beast hit the wall for a second time, making an enormous crack on it. \n\n\"Who?\" I asked. \n\n\"Dog.\" The entity replied. \n\n\"Mace?\" I spoke, perplexed. \n\n\"Mace— not his true— name.\" The entity said as the beast finally tore through the wall, revealing itself to be a bear and in one swift movement knocked me out.\n\nThe next morning, Mace woke me up and I saw the hole on the wall, a testimony of the previous day strange and terrifying events. Glad that both of us were still alive, I packed up and left, with the intention of never returning to such a quiet life. I took the direction of a big and busy city, hoping that it will help me escape from the past, but little did I know that [Mace](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10aum5h/i_will_never_own_a_pet_again/) carried a fragment of the supernatural encounter with him.",

        "text": "[part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10xmbik/its_downstairs_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nIf there was one thing I have learned through these experiences, it's that everything happens without much rhyme, or reason. And sometimes, bad things happen to good people. \n\nNot saying that I’m a good person, or my roommates are good people. However, I like to think that in essence, I am a decent member of society. I have my instances where I do feel like I am better than someone, whether its because of what I have versus what they don’t. And I realize that in a sense of modest euphoria, I had a lot more than most kids did when I was younger, and there were times that I would flaunt it. \n\nI’m not denying my flaws, and I’ve worked pretty hard over the years to correct them. But this entire situation does feel like a punishment for all the hell I’ve caused.\n\nI don’t believe that my past arrogance from high school is what has caused this. \n\nI’ve tried salt. Spells, and I have a Christian friend who directed me towards her pastor and a few other people to come bless the house. At first I thought it worked. But to no avail. It’s here again. But I’m not alone.\n\nMy other two roommates are on a trip this week, which only left Sam and I to stay here with the cats. It’s no problem, obviously. They’re our cats.  \n\nI’m going to admit, I do have the senseless nerve to confront the thing. I’ve been seeing it in my dreams, each thing I read, I somehow feel like it’s commenting on the demon thing living in my home. Our home. I’m trying to make a life for myself with this opportunity. I’m trying to help my best friends make a life as well. \n\nIt’s been a hard few years to change to the person I am today. I’m not proud of my past, but I’m willing to move forward. \n\nAnyways. Sam took VTO today (Voluntary time off). \n\nIt’s been about a week. Maybe two since the thing last made any type of contact with me. Even so. I feel like the intensity of this thing is getting more erratic, and aggressive towards me, and my roommates. No one has really noticed the vibe of the house, except me. \n\nThere is a darker, thin veil of uncertainty. It’s like a rusty, morbid feeling that festers until it all comes boils over. The intensity of it is absolute. Every time I walk past that door. The door to the basement, I can’t help but stop and look at it. The fleeting sense of lifelessness soaks through the bottom. The smell has changed from a dusty cat smell, to a smell of metallic, and burnt hair. It physically makes me recoil. \n\nThe weird thing? \n\nI can still do my laundry fine. \n\nDuring the day, I can still walk down to my basement to get my clothes. I can load the machines, iron my white shirts. Fold, hang, and pull out random boxes from the basement with no impending feeling of doom or dread. \n\nHowever, walking by that door makes me so irrationally sick to my stomach, that sometimes tears come from my eyes. Like cutting an onion, but a true sense of sadness. \n\nI would be remiss to say that I didn’t want to confront it. I do. As soon as the thought springs up in my mind. I know better. \n\nIt was early when it first made its rounds. Far too early. So early in fact, that I hadn’t thought anything of it. Hell, the Dollar General down the street wasn’t even closed yet. And Sam and I went to get snacks and soda for the movie we wanted to watch. Sit on her bed with some popcorn, a cheap bottle of Pink Moscato. She was going to smoke a little bit, and I was going to lay back.\n\nIt’s bothering me to type this out. I don’t know what is going to happen. That scares me if I’m going to be frank. And to be fair, anyone would be. \n\nAs I’m writing this in my car. My roommate is currently next to me with her seat all the way back to sleep. Every time I glance over at her, I feel powerless. This is my house. A house I invited her to live in. She should feel safe, and comfortable, Sam should feel at ease. But she doesn’t. \n\nThe slam of the basement door caught me off guard the second time. Still, I assumed it was the other roommates back home from their trip. \n\nSam and I looked at each other in disbelief. \n\n“What the fuck was that?” She asked quietly. \n\nI couldn’t do anything else but shrug. Admittedly at the time, I was hardly paying attention. I did lean over to pull her curtains. It had to be the other roommates right? Was it the new neighbors next door?  \n\nThere were no cars in my neighbors drive, and there wasn’t a red Chevy sedan parked up front, or down the street. \n\nI look at my phone: 21:25 (9:25pm). \n\nI wasn’t ready for that shit. Sam wasn’t ready for this shit. \n\nHer room is right above the kitchen where the basement door is. You have to pass it once per day at least, especially when you’re leaving the house. The side door, and the basement door are perfectly perpendicular with each other. I pressed my ear to the door as slowly as I could. And I heard it. \n\n*tap tap, tap tap* Like a heartbeat? \n\nIt was so faint, and quiet, and I had to tell Sam to mute her TV. \n\nI listened again.\n\n*tap tap, tap tap* Like a nail tapping on the door. \n\nIt took a lot of courage to gather a few blankets and pillows for us. I knew the door to the basement was closed, and frankly, I wanted to make a run for the front door. The door was so close, you can see the door  at the bottom of the main staircase. You can look from the top, and it’s right there. I only needed to muster the courage to lead the way. \n\nThe cats weren’t anywhere to be seen. They never made it up the stairs. I couldn’t even hear them eating, or using the litter box. Drinking from the water bowl. In fact, I couldn’t hear anything. \n\nI live in a small town in Ohio. It’s technically considered a village. But we live in between two pretty major cities. I live maybe ten minutes from the Indiana/Ohio line, so traffic can get pretty heavy. But there wasn’t any traffic at all. \n\nSam was freaked out, of course. And through her questions and nervousness, I tried to ignore it. I even went as far as to open the window and put my head out. \n\nThere wasn’t any wind. No sound of leaves. \n\nMy motion sensor light that is incredibly sensitive didn’t even light up. It’s so sensitive, that even on the second floor, if you even press your hand against the window, it would light up. There’s a roof that connects underneath the window, so it could be turning on due to the vibration of my hand. So, I reached out and knocked on the roof. Nothing. It was unusual, but I was also intrigued. \n\nDid this happen every time that thing made its presence known? \n\nI waited for a car. A horn, the sound of a farm truck rolling through on Main Street. They were awfully loud things, and often woke me up. \n\nNothing. \n\nAt this point, I had to tell Sam to chill out. Not that those types of gestures or words ever help someone ‘chill out’, we can all agree. However, she got the message when I finally put my pointer finger to my lip with a shush. \n\nSeveral things were going through my head at this point. \n\nWe’re we stuck in a weird time warp? Did we cross dimensions? Did everyone stop in time, but we were for some reason still moving with it? \n\nI pulled out my phone to check the time, and sure enough, a few minutes had passed. \n\nThe basement door opened and closed again with force. And I was brought back from my trance. \n\nThe worst part was the fact that the cats were nowhere to be seen. \n\nI’m not proud of what I did next. And as I sit here typing this in my car, I take small glances at the dining room window, I’m filled with regret, and for some reason, In my mind, I am mourning them as if they’re dead. But they’re not. I can see them. \n\nI grabbed a bunch of pillows, blankets, and a phone charger. I made sure to grab some snacks too. I ushered Sam to slip on a pair of shoes with me. I made sure to grab my keys and my bag. We left the bedroom light on. We walked down the steps, and they creaked something fierce. It’s an old, unrenovated house. Even though the sound wasn’t an issue in the past, it definitely was now. Right when we reached the bottom of the steps, we heard the basement door slam open with force. So much force that I’m sure, absolutely positive that there was going to be a gash in the wall. The most frightening part was the fact that it was so close. I had never heard the thing so close before. \n\nThe worst part though, was the footsteps. \n\nIt sounded like boots, slowly stomping their way towards us. I was stuck in place. Sam juggled with the lock on the door. It was always hard to open sometimes, the mechanism got jammed. \n\nI saw the worst of it though. My blood ran cold, and my eyes widened. I shortened my breath in fear, but an overwhelming sense to also fight was there. \n\nWhen faced with certain issues, typically your brain gives you two signals to choose from. Fight or flight. The adrenaline is there to give you the energy to survive. But, in my case. There was both. \n\nI wanted to flee as soon as I saw it. But I also wanted to throw everything on the ground and fight. I’ve never been in a fight before, so I try to avoid it. But this urge to try and take it on was hot on my trail of stupidity. \n\nI stood there, in anger of my home being invaded, and my friends being tormented. But I also stood in fear. Fear of what it wanted. Fear of where my cats were. What happened to them? When the commotion started, did they hide? \n\nThe rooms are separated by a wall of course, but there is also an archway entrance. \n\nI saw a hand. A pitch black hand, slowly gripping that archway. The metallic smell that had permeated the house creeps in with it, I could hear it breathing harshly. And the fingers curled meticulously in a grip. Almost like it was taunting us. \n\nI remember when I came downstairs that I had put my own hand on the wall for support, and accidentally flipped the upstairs light switch on. The light reflected down the steps and illuminated the living room quite a bit. Even with the light reflecting to the bottom of the steps, and even a part of the dining room, the hand never got brighter. I don’t know how to explain it. Even as sleep lingers and the adrenaline is gone, I don’t think I ever will. But, it always remained pitch black. \n\nWhen I noticed this, Sam was able to unjam the front door, and she grabbed my forearm, and ripped me out the door. All the shit I had in my arms tumbled onto the front porch, and Sam slammed it shut. \n\nAs I grappled with picking the pillows, blankets and the phone charger up. Sam slammed the door closed, but again, the latch overall, has a tendency to jam. And so, instead of latching shut, the door popped open. \n\nWe didn’t look back as we ran to the driveway, and since I was the only one who grabbed keys. We ran to my car. I’m lucky in that I have a fob key, so all I have to do is pull the handle for the car to unlock. \n\nThat is where I am typing this right now. \n\nI don’t know what’s going on. How to feel. I don’t know what to do.\n\nI’ve been trying to text my mom, friends, and any family. But nothing is sending. \n\nI’ve tried turning my car on, but I can’t put it in drive. It won’t go anywhere. My car will run. So we have heat. \n\nI used the few pillows that I grabbed to block some of the windows. I even used my backseat to get into my trunk to get out the windshield cover, and put it up. \n\nSam cried herself to sleep. And I’m in a state of total shock. Occasionally, I’ll peek from the driver side window to see into the dining room, the curtains are parted slightly. And I see our cats glaring back at us. Unblinking, dead eyes. But are surely alive. \n\nIt’s been nearly three hours. And not a single car has passed. I can’t text anyone, but I can watch YouTube or read Reddit posts.\n\nI miss the cats. The fact that we had to leave them devastates me. Maybe it was too late for them though. Maybe they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe they’re gone, and they’re not our cats anymore. But instead, a husk of what they used to be. \n\nSam cried herself to sleep a few hours ago. I can still see the dried tears on her cheeks. \n\nI don’t know if I’m gonna be able to post this. I don’t know if I’m going to die tonight. I don’t know if my family is going to wonder where I am, or how my mom is going to react. I don’t know a lot. But I do know one thing:\n\nIf I get out of this hellish night alive. I will get to the bottom of this. \n\nI know this is probably going to be the least exciting story you read. But to those of you who stuck around, or who want to stick around. I will find a way to survive. \n\nSuggestions and advice are much appreciated. \n\nUntil next time.",

        "text": "As a child, I was always fascinated by my grandmother's collection of antique dolls. She kept them on a shelf in her living room, carefully dusted and arranged in a row. Each one had a story and a history, but there was one that always caught my eye. It was an old porcelain doll with curly blonde hair and a frilly blue dress. My grandmother told me it was over a hundred years old and had been passed down through generations of our family. She called it the family heirloom.\n\nYears went by, and I eventually forgot about the doll. But when my grandmother died, it was passed down to me. At first, I was excited to have it, but soon strange things started happening. Every time I looked at the doll, I felt uneasy, like it was watching me. Its eyes seemed to follow me around the room, and sometimes I could swear I saw them blink.\n\nOne night, I woke up to the sound of soft footsteps in my bedroom. I sat up and saw the doll standing at the foot of my bed, its eyes glowing in the darkness. I was frozen with fear, unable to move or scream. The doll reached out a porcelain hand and touched my leg, and I felt a cold, clammy sensation.\n\nAfter that night, the doll's presence became more and more pronounced. It seemed to move on its own, appearing in different places in my house each day. Sometimes it would be in the kitchen, sitting on a chair. Other times it would be in the hallway, staring down at me as I walked by. I tried to ignore it, but it was always there, always watching.\n\nThen, one night, I woke up to the sound of the doll laughing. It was a high-pitched, maniacal cackle that echoed through my house. I got out of bed and followed the sound to the living room, where I saw the doll sitting on the floor, surrounded by other dolls from my grandmother's collection. They were all turned to face me, their eyes glowing in the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, the room grew cold, and a gust of wind blew through the open window. The dolls began to move, their porcelain limbs creaking and cracking. They formed a circle around me, and I felt trapped, like I was being suffocated by their presence.\n\nThen, the doll in the blue dress spoke. Its voice was cold and hollow, like the wind blowing through a graveyard.\n\n\"You have taken something that belongs to us,\" it said. \"We want it back.\"\n\nI didn't know what it was talking about, but I was too terrified to speak. The dolls began to move closer, their porcelain faces twisted into grotesque expressions.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered something my grandmother had told me. She said that the doll was cursed, that it had been created by a vengeful witch who wanted to punish our family for a past wrong.\n\nI knew then what I had to do. I reached out and grabbed the cursed doll, feeling its cold, lifeless body in my hands. With all my strength, I threw it against the wall, shattering it into a million pieces.\n\nThe other dolls fell silent, and the room grew still. I knew then that the curse had been broken, and the dolls would no longer haunt me. But I also knew that I would never forget the terror I had felt that night, and the knowledge that evil can sometimes lurk in the most innocent of objects.",

        "text": "I always had an interest in haunted houses, and my friends knew it too. That's why when they found out about the house on Willow Street, they knew they had to bring me along. We arrived at the house at midnight, just as the legends said to do. It was old and decrepit, with vines crawling up the sides and a foreboding feeling about it.\n\nAs we walked up the creaky wooden steps, I couldn't shake the feeling that we shouldn't be here. But I didn't want to let my friends down, so I followed them inside. The air was thick and musty, and the darkness made it hard to see where we were going. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew through the house, slamming doors shut and causing debris to fly around us.\n\nMy friends started to panic, but I tried to stay calm. We continued through the house, and that's when I saw it – a figure standing in the corner of the room. It was difficult to make out any features, but I could tell that it wasn't human. My friends didn't see it, so I thought I was going crazy.\n\nBut then the figure moved, and my friends finally saw it too. We all screamed and ran out of the house, but something followed us. We could hear footsteps and whispers behind us as we fled. We ran all the way back to my friend's car and peeled out of there as fast as we could.\n\nBut the terror didn't stop there. Over the next few days, strange things started happening to each of us. My friend's TV turned on by itself and played static all night. Another friend's phone would ring, but there was never anyone on the other end. And for me, the haunting took a more physical form.\n\nI would wake up with bruises on my arms and legs, as if something had been holding onto me in my sleep. And then one night, I woke up to find the figure from the haunted house standing at the foot of my bed. I couldn't move, couldn't scream. It just stood there, watching me.\n\nI tried to ignore it, but it was always there, lurking in the shadows. I started to lose sleep and my grades suffered. I didn't want to tell my friends what was happening to me because I didn't want them to think I was crazy. But then one day, my friend called me up and said that she had a dream about the haunted house.\n\nIn her dream, she saw the figure that we had all encountered in the house. But this time, it spoke to her. It told her that it had been trapped in the house for years and that it wanted our help to escape. We didn't know what to do, but we decided to go back to the house to see if we could help the ghost.\n\nWe arrived at the house again at midnight, just as we had before. But this time, we came armed with information. We had researched the history of the house and discovered that it was once owned by a family who had lost a child. The figure we had seen was the ghost of that child, and it had been trapped in the house ever since.\n\nWe performed a ritual to help the ghost move on, and after it was complete, the house was filled with a blinding light. When it faded, the figure was gone, and we knew that we had done the right thing. As we walked out of the house, I felt a sense of closure. The ghost was finally at peace, and so were we.",

        "text": "One time, we were doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings on the mountain in the last couple of days. Our job was to scout out the area where mountain lions are seen to ensure they’re in the area, so we can warn people and close off the trails.  \n I was hiking out on my own in a heavily forested part of the park, with trees so dense they almost completely blocked out the sun. I’d been out all day enjoying the lush scenery of the park with no sight of any mountain lions in the reported areas.   \nIt was nearing dusk when I heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance. Now, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It’s unsettling, but far from unusual. I radioed back and let base operations know I heard one, and that I’d keep going to see where its territory started.  \n I kept trekking around the park and heard it scream a couple more times, always in the same spot. I assumed the approximate area of the mountain lion’s territory, and was about to head back before I heard another scream, this time only within a couple hundred feet of me. Of course I freak out and start heading back at a brisk pace because the last thing I want is to get mauled to death by a damn mountain lion.   \nAs I got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed me, and I broke into a jog. It continued to follow me until when I was about a mile from base ops, the screaming stopped. \n\nIt was basically night at this point, so I turned around to see if it was behind me, and I could see in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, I could see a distinct male figure in the shadows that I don’t remember passing at all. The park was closed, so there shouldn’t have been anyone on the trail at this point. I called out to him, warning him that the paths were closed, and that he needed to go back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, it seemed like he was out of breath, and just something was off. \n\nSo I started to walk over to guide him back since we were pretty close to ops. The sun had set over the horizon about 15 minutes ago, so it was getting pretty dark. As I was walking over, I pulled out my pocket knife which had a little flashlight on the keychain, so when I was about 10 feet away from him, I flicked on the flashlight and shined it on his chest (so as not to blind him) asking him if he was alright. \n\nHe cocked his head like he didn’t understand me, but he was breathing slow and deep so I wondered if he was in pain. I moved a little closer and asked him again if he was okay. I moved the light up, and something didn’t seem right, so I stopped. He kept breathing in these real slow, deep breaths, and eventually I sort of figured out gradually what was bothering me about him. It was like he was pretending to breathe, but not actually doing it. His breaths were too even and deep, all his movements were exaggerated, like his shoulders moving up and his chest exhaling. I told him to identify himself, but he stayed silent. I moved the light onto his face, and I shit you not, this guy had no face. Just smooth grayish skin. I freaked out, and I sort of fumbled with the light, and he took an impossibly long step forwards, to where before I knew it, he was two feet away from me. \n\nI don’t know how to explain it, but one second he was on the corner of the trail, and the next he was right in front of me. I never moved or blinked but it was like my brain couldn’t keep up. I stumbled back and fell back on my ass. Now that he was closer I could see this line open up on his throat. I stretched up to where his ears should have been, had his head tilted back and he let out the exact same scream I had been hearing for the past hour. I didn’t even say anything, I just turned and sprinted back to ops as fast as I could, but by the time I got back, the screaming had moved further into the woods. \n\nI never mentioned it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and we should close those paths until the animal could be located and moved.",

        "text": "I was about five years old when Andrew appeared to me. He was my first imaginary friend. I didn’t have any real friends, so I was grateful for Andrew. Mostly we just played dolls together or made up games outside. He never really want away, living with me and accompanying me to Kindergarten. The only time that Andrew didn’t follow me was when I went to church. I’d made some friends at kindergarten but not at church, so I was sad that he disappeared when we went there.\n\nI did enjoy church though. I liked the singing, I liked the people, I liked dressing up for it. Even if I didn’t have many friends there, there were always kids my age that I’d occasionally play games with after the services, so it wasn’t too bad that I didn’t have Andrew with me. I didn’t always understand the priest’s words, but I liked him and I knew that he was very well-respected.\n\nAs I grew up a bit, I became more and more of a tomboy. I got my hair cut and joined sports teams. Sometimes strangers would mistake me for a boy, which always got my parents angry for some reason, but it didn’t bother me too much. At some point I started going by the name Ash instead of my full name Ashley, after Ash in Pokémon. My parents didn’t like this, because I was naming myself after a boy, but I didn’t see how it was a problem. They always called me by my full name, but my teammates and Andrew called me Ash.\n\nI’d talked about Andrew a lot when I was a little kid, but I think at some point you’re expected to outgrow your imaginary friends, so when I was about ten years old I stopped talking about him, but he was still there and he was aging alongside of me. My parents had forced me to grow out my hair, and I no longer got mistaken for a boy, which relieved them...but I personally hated it. I liked it more when everyone thought I was a boy. My friends were split pretty evenly between girls and boys, and I always wanted to be seen as a boy around them. Most of them kept calling me a girl, but there were a few who’d call me a boy. I think they thought it was a game of some sort, and I suppose even I thought it was a game too. My parents were constantly telling me that God made me a girl and I better respect that and stay one, that girls can’t change into boys. Well, I knew that much, of course I couldn’t change my gender. I just wish I’d been born different.\n\nBy the time middle school rolled around, I still hadn’t outgrown Andrew, but I didn’t interact with him much anymore. Andrew and would only get to hang out when I was alone, and we did less playing and more talking. I’d tell him all about my day and he told me a bunch of cool facts about the world. \n\nI’m not sure where I was when I first learned about being trans. I think I read about it in a book or something. I started to wonder if that could be me. Had my parents been wrong? Was it possible for a girl to become a boy? I told Andrew before I told anyone else, and he supported me. He immediately started calling me a guy and by he/him pronouns. He asked if I still liked the name Ash or if I wanted to change my name completely, and I said I wasn’t sure.\n\nIt took longer to come out to my parents. I was really excited to tell them, but I knew it was a big change and that they might have some questions. I told them over dinner one night.\n\n“Remember how you told me that girls can’t become boys? Well it turns out they can!” I said happily, telling them all that I’d learned. But my Dad cut me off halfway into my lecture.\n\n“No. Stop with that nonsense, I will not tolerate it in this house. You’re a girl, you always have been, and you always will be, being transsexual is to be against God. It’s to say that He created you wrong, do you really believe that?” He slammed his fist down on the table. “You will not be changing your gender, it’s not possible! You can talk to Father Mason if you’re really going to be this deluded about it.”\n\nI remained strong at the table, but I stayed up for most of the night crying. Andrew kept hugging me and telling me that my parents were wrong, that everything was perfectly okay with me. But he did warn me to not tell anyone else, or at least to be careful about who I told.\n\nI became a bit more secluded after that. Andrew was the only person who knew, and although I do think some of my friends would’ve been supportive, I still wasn’t ready to tell them after the horrible incident with my parents. My friends had all outgrown the “game” in which I pretended to be a boy, so Andrew was the only person who saw me for what I was.\n\nHigh school was better in some ways. The building was much bigger and had way more people, so it wasn't too hard to make friends. I joined the Gay/Straight Alliance without telling my parents, and introduced myself for the first time as James, a transgender boy. I told them to call me Ashley in public though - I was only James during the meetings, but at least it was something. I wasn’t as involved in extracurriculars in high school as I had been in middle school, but I attended every GSA meeting. I doubted my parents had forgotten my failed coming out, so I slowly eased in to trying to present more masculine. A short haircut one month. Gradually buying a more masculine wardrobe over the course of a few more months. I really just looked like a butch lesbian with a really bad fashion sense, but I was happy, and to my relief, my parents weren’t too suspicious about it. I think I pretended it was some type of Hollywood or internet trend, to be a girl who dresses more masculine. Puberty prevented me from being “mistaken” for a boy in public anyway. \n\nI didn’t think about Andrew much at all anymore, which therefore meant I didn’t see him. I always looked back and assumed that he had been a coping mechanism of some sort, at first for my loneliness and lack of friends, and later for the transphobia that I was facing from my parents. But there will still some things about him I couldn’t explain, things that disturbed me a little - for instance, how many of you could see your imaginary friends? Like, I swear I’m not making this up, but I could *see* him. It’s possible I just had a really active imagination...but he was...*there*. It wasn’t just “I have an imaginary friend with brown hair and eyes and he always wears Spongebob tees.” No, Andrew was as legitimate as the other people that I saw every day, four dimensional and *real*. I could hear him too; he always had a bit of a high voice for a boy which I suppose, again, was some type of comforting feature I made up about him to deal with my own gender identity. But I was the only one who ever saw or heard him. For awhile I thought maybe I’d suffered from some type of hallucination in childhood, but 1.) Andrew was the only thing I saw that didn’t exist and 2.) he didn’t cause any type of *suffering*, quite the opposite. \n\nChurch remained a fixture of my life, but no longer an enjoyable one. I’m sure you’ve all figured out where my mom and dad — and, I was realizing, most of my town in general — got their homophobia and transphobia from. I can’t remember what the sermons were like in my childhood, but the ones I was attending as a teen became increasingly more bigoted. I tried not to take it to heart — I knew that the cruel words were wrong — but it hurt to hear.\n\nI don’t remember how it happened, but at some point I got outed to my family. I think they’d read my texts or overhead me talking about it to a friend from GSA. It was terrible, but they never hit me or even verbally abused me. They took my phone and computer away, and they even stopped letting me take the bus to school — they had to drive me every day now. They made me drop out of all after-school activities. Luckily, GSA meetings were held during lunch time, so I didn’t lose the small support network that I had. My parents made me grow out my hair again and I was forced to wear dresses and skirts every day. They wouldn’t let me wear pants, even if they came from the women’s section.\n\nNot only that, but bad things started to happen to me and my parents, and they were convinced that it was because I had cursed them with my “sinful lifestyle.” There was one weird thing though - every time something bad had happened, I started to see Andrew again. He hadn’t been in my life for years, and here he was again, turning up at my worst times.\n\nThe first time he appeared was a night when we’d gotten robbed. Someone had broke into our house and stolen money from our safe. How, I don’t know, but I do know this: When the police came to the scene, I could make out a figure standing in the street. It was too dark to see much, but I saw a tiny teenage boy about my age, with short curly dark hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. He looked familiar, but the person he looked like didn’t exist. I was sure he was just some nosy neighbor watching the crime scene. It had to be a coincidence that he looked like my imaginary friend from childhood.\n\nHe appeared again a few months later, during the first week of summer vacation. We were all going on a road trip across the country, and I was actually pretty excited about it. While I didn’t care to be spending so much time with only my parents, it’d be nice to get out and see more of the United States.\n\nWe never made it — we got hit on the highway and hit a guardrail. No one was fatally harmed, but the car was totaled and I even passed out due to the shock and initial pain. As I blacked out, I could see Andrew standing in the trees, watching me. I came to only a few minutes later, and he wasn’t there anymore. It didn’t go over too well with my family nor the parademics when I was screaming about seeing someone who wasn’t there, but at least I had the sense to not mention that it was my imaginary friend who had turned evil.\n\nThose were the only two major incidents, but Andrew remained in my life, and he was no longer a welcome presence. I seriously started to wonder if my theory about experiencing hallucinations was true, considering the fact that no one else had ever seen Andrew and he now had became sometjing evil. One day my whole family got sick with a stomach flu, and as I was puking into a trashcan on the couch, I could make out Andrew’s likeness reflected in the black TV screen, staring at me. When I turned around to look, he wasn’t there. Another time I broke my leg walking down the stairs getting ready for school, and I saw him in the waiting room. I learned to associate any pain or injury or suffering with Andrew, and I hated him and I just wanted him to leave me alone.\n\nA strange fact about me is I don’t often have dreams, but I still remember my most vivid nightmare. I was a child again in the dream, playing tag with Andrew, but all of the sudden the dream turned dark. Andrew, who never said a cruel word to me as a kid, took a step closer to me in the dream, glaring at me.\n\n“You need to get out of here. Run somewhere far away. No one here likes you, you’d be better off anywhere else.” I ran away to my house, crying, and when I got inside, my parents were there, but in no state that I ever wanted to see them in. Dead and bleeding out on the floor. Andrew, who had somehow beaten me home, was brandishing a knife. “You’re next, James.”\n\nI woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, turning my lights on and jumping out of bed. I was sixteen years old, no longer a child, and my relationship with my parents was, obviously, strained. But still, I expected them to come in and check on me when they heard me screaming. I ran to their room, terrified that the dream had been real, but they were peacefully sleeping — and yes, I checked to make sure that they were breathing.\n\n“It’s not worth it. I mean it. I was warning you, leave!” a voice from behind me said. I turned around, and I heard footsteps running away but I did not see Andrew or hear his voice again. Needless to say, I did not fall back asleep, and I had to be up in about two hours for church anyway, so I went downstairs and made myself some coffee and tried to forget the dream. \n\nI couldn’t tell you what happened in church that day. The pastor could’ve given the most disgusting hateful sermon imaginable, or he could’ve changed his course completely and told all of us in the pews to spend the rest of our lives advocating for queer rights — *I was not there mentally*. I kept looking around the room, expecting to see Andrew. \n\nHe never showed up, but I was way too scared to sleep that night. Luckily, that night brought the dreamless and peaceful sleep that I was used to, though due to the lack of sleep I’d gotten the night before, I ended up oversleeping and missing first period.\n\nI got called down to the office in second period, which I at first assumed it was due to my tardiness, so you can imagine my shock when I saw my parents and two officers there.\n\n“Ashley, take a seat,” the officer said, and I had conditioned myself to not flinch at my birth name, but it did make me remember something — hadn’t Andrew called me James after he threatened me? I’d never told him that name. I was only Ash to him. How did he know my chosen name?\n\nIt turns out that being late to school that day saved my life. See, I’d had this one suitor at my church, Patrick, a nice Christian boy on the surface, but deep down he was someone who’d heard the rumors about me being queer. He thought I was a lesbian though, not a pansexual trans guy, and he’d always ask me if I wanted him to “fix” my homosexuality. He was just a sleezy dude, I never saw him as much of a threat, but it turned out he’d been lingering around the school that day with an attempt to kidnap me — he also had a gun and a knife in his trunk. He’d gotten pulled over for speeding, and he confessed everything, which seemed weird to me, but then the officer made a comment that made me freeze up.\n\n“He said that someone named Andrew said that he would kill him if he did not confess. Is there anyone at your school with that name, or at your church?”\n\nImaginary Andrew had been the only Andrew I knew, but this comment made me think. Could Andrew still be looking out for me? After all, he’d threatened to kill my potential kidnapper/murderer/rapist/God knows what. But Andrew had threatened *me* as well, telling me that I was next, and I couldn’t forget the nightmare about what he had done to my parents. My former friend wasn’t a serial killer, was he? Maybe I was still loyal to him in a way, because I still couldn’t bring myself to see him as much more than symbol of really bad luck. I hated him and feared him, yes, but I still had so many years of good memories with him.\n\nLife quieted down a bit after the incident with Patrick. I put all of my energy into applying for colleges, trying to find ones that were located in queer friendly areas and were far away from my parents. I couldn’t exactly look up “LGBT friendly colleges” on the home computer, which was surely being monitored, and I still didn’t have my devices back, so I mostly relied on school computers or my friends from GSA who were in the same boat. I actually forgot about Andrew for awhile, until one more final incident, the night before I was going to sneak off to my first Pride parade. I ended up getting awfully sick from something I ate, and when I was crawling from my bedroom to the bathroom for the fifth time that night, I got a glimpse of someone sitting on my neighbor’s porch. It was only because I knew who it was that I was terrified. Had it been anyone else I would’ve assumed it was some guest that my neighbor was hosting who was taking a smoke break in the middle of the night. Stomach issues aside, I didn’t get much sleep that night, and I was way too unwell to make it to Pride.\n\nAfter that, life looked up. I got accepted with a full ride to a huge college about eight hours away, in a medium-sized hippie town in a blue area. My parents were pretty concerned about me going off to a big liberal school for reasons that I don’t have to explain, but I’m luckier than most people, because at least they still *allowed* me to go. The end of high school was a whirlwind, now that freedom was in site. I never saw Andrew again, and I truly forgot about him as I started to count the days until I moved to my dorm.\n\nCollege was much easier than in high school in a lot of ways; the workload was heavier but I could also choose my own classes and schedule, and of course, I was free to be myself in peace. Life was going great! I had a job, I was thriving in my program, and I had a great social life. I only saw my parents over holidays, which was more than enough for me. In my second year of college, I decided to bite the bullet and start my medical transition. I knew that this would surely mean getting disowned, but I could handle it. It was well worth it to be able to be me. About a year into my transition, I passed as male to most people, and even those who initially read me as a woman would be accepting once I corrected them. I got a boyfriend who not only was okay with my trans identity, but outright celebrated it. I’d gotten back into sports again, being able to play on male teams. Life was crazy, but it was also normal, all things considered.\n\nLast week though, I got a text from a number I didn’t know. It didn’t even look like an American number, but the text was in perfect English and it was clearly meant for me, as it read,  \n “Hey James! Could you meet me on the third floor of the library at 7 PM, in the computer room?\"\n\nI texted back, “sure, but who is this?” I assumed it was some project partner or classmate whose number I’d forgotten to save, but I was unsure why they might want to meet me, as I couldn’t remember lining up any study sessions or anything. I never got a text back from the number, but I made my way to the library around 7 anyway.\n\nAt first I thought maybe I’d been pranked, as I didn’t see anyone there. But a few minutes later, someone walked in, someone who looked familiar in ways I couldn’t place, but it was not a pleasant familiarity. Definitely not anyone from a class.\n\n“It’s been awhile,” the man said.”How are you doing?”\n\n“Uh…I’m alright. I’m sorry to be rude, but uh…” I didn’t know how to ask this guy who he was without coming off like an asshole.  \n “You don’t recognize me, do you?” he asked. “I’m Andrew.”\n\nAndrew. My first friend who later became someone who wasn’t that.\n\n“You mean, you were real?” I asked. I don’t know why I asked it — of course I knew he was real. I’d see him any time something terrible happened to me.\n\nAndrew smiled. “I am, but not in the way that you might think. Let me explain. I’m not a figment of your imagination, but nor am I a person proper. I’m someone who is like you, or was like you at one point.”\n\nI cut him off, I couldn’t help it. “I know exactly what you are. You don’t need to tell me you’re not a person, no person could be as fucked up as you are.”\n\nAndrew smiled sadly. “James, please just hear me out for a minute. I never wanted to cause you any pain. I’ve always been protecting you.”\n\nBullshit.\n\n“The first time you saw me again, when you first started to think me evil. Tell me about that night,\" Andrew went on.\n\nI scoffed. “We’d gotten robbed. We’d gotten robbed, and you were just there watching! Probably laughing!”\n\nAndrew smiled still, but his smile was no longer sad. “You’re right that I was laughing, but wrong that I was only watching, and surely wrong about the reason why I was laughing. It was me who took the money. Your parents had…not great intentions about how they wanted to spend it. They wanted to put a bunch of their savings into sending you to conversion therapy, James. I couldn’t let that happen.”\n\n“Conversion…therapy…” I repeated. I wouldn’t put it past my parents, honestly, but I still didn’t believe Andrew. I’d seen him too many times, in too many bad circumstances for it to make sense.\n\nHe went on, “Same when you got into that car crash. There was never a road trip or a vacation, they were gonna send you to one of those awful religious camps. The trip they told you about was a lie. I had to get you into that accident. When you broke your leg, your parents were going to send you to a private meeting with that awful priest later that day. That time when you saw me when you were sick with the flu? You’d missed church that week due to your illnesses, and Patrick was planning on inviting you to lunch after the sermon. I’m sure you can figure out his intentions. Same for that nightmare you had, and again when I warned you verbally...I meant it literally, James, that you were next. I never intended or even wanted to hurt your parents, though it did tempt me at times when I saw how they treated you. No, I chose that nightmare because I knew it would stick with you. When I said that thing to you in the dream about how no one in the town liked you, again, I didn’t mean to hurt you, I just thought it’d be something that would eventually push you to get out. The night you got sick before going to Pride, it was because your parents would’ve caught you and I couldn’t bear to think about what they would’ve done to you.”\n\nI was quiet for a few minutes, taking in Andrew’s explanation. I decided that I believed it. Andrew had been my friend all along - my protector - and I'd thought that he was evil.\n\n“I hated you, you know,” I said. “I really thought you were out to get me. I should’ve known better.”\n\nAndrew waved away my apologies. “Don’t feel bad about it. If it’d been up to me, I never would’ve caused you any pain whatsoever. If it were in my control, I would’ve had you win a trip around the world and that would’ve been why you couldn’t go to conversion camp. I would’ve given you a sweet dream of the real me, the me who loves you, where I warned you directly about Patrick’s intentions and told you how much you meant to me. But there are some things that I can’t control, and even still, fear sticks with you more than any other emotion does. Scaring you and hurting you was the only way I could make my plans work, and although I know I scared you and hurt you less than what the alternatives would’ve been, I still regret causing you any type of pain.”\n\n“I forgive you,” I told him, because of course I did. “This whole time I thought you were some sinister force, when you were really a guardian angel.”\n\n“Not quite an angel, for an angel wouldn’t have caused you to suffer at all. But I am a spirit,” Andrew said.\n\n“A spirit?” I repeated.\n\nAndrew nodded. “You see, I came from a family not unlike yours. I realized I was trans much younger than you did. I didn’t have the word for it, but I started talking to my parents about how I wanted to be a boy instead of a girl when I was just six years old. They didn’t take too well to it, but I didn’t let up. My father murdered me when I was about ten.” Andrew said it so casually, but my heart broke more and more with every word. I stepped closer to him and pulled him into a hug, not letting myself cry even though I wanted to. \n\n“That’s terrible,” I told him. “I’m so sorry.”\n\nAndrew hugged me back for a solid moment, but then he pulled away to look me in my eyes. “Do not be sorry. After I…well, you know, after I died, I came back to this world as a ghost. Not your typical ghost, though. As you can see that I’m plenty solid and capable of presenting myself as a human when necessary. What I do is, I act as a protector for other trans children in unwelcoming environments, providing them with friendship and doing everything in my power to protect them. As you’ve seen, unfortunately that protection doesn’t always look like protection, but it is what I’m doing. Remember when we were kids and I’d always tell you all of those geography facts about the world? Well, they were all based on places where I travelled, other kids I needed to protect. I still do it to this day. I always change my age to be around the same age as the kids, but if you account for my human birthday I’d say I’m in my mid-forties, age wise, though I don't age like humans do.”\n\nIt was surreal - most people wouldn’t believe it, but I believed every word. Andrew had been my friend, then I saw him as my enemy, but he’d always been my protector.\n\n“I’m very grateful for you,” I told him. “I’m so glad you appeared now, to explain yourself. I never should’ve feared you.”\n\nAndrew smiled at me again. “I understand why you did. But it’s okay, James, you’re safe now. I’m still making sure of that, I’m still looking out for you.”\n\nThis time, I smiled back at him. “Yeah. I’m safe now.”\n\n“And if you ever feel unsafe again, you have my phone number now,” Andrew said with a slight laugh. \n\nI don’t remember how the conversation ended, I just know that we went our separate ways, but it was not a goodbye. I can still feel Andrew looking out for me and watching over me, and like I said, he’s just a call or text away if I ever feel threatened.",

        "text": "Day 1 \n\nMy name is Courtney Jackson I'm apart of a strike team hired by a team of researchers to a forest somewhere in the Amazon to help research a newly discovered species of tree. We are a team of 8. 2 researchers and 6 agents. I don't know why they need an entire strike team to research a damn tree but i don't ask questions im just here for the money. Me and my team have been wandering through this forest for 6 hours now, we've set up a camp for the night so I thought I would write in my journal. I don't know why but the scientists recommend to bring things to improve our mental health so I bought a journal to write about what we find. There's not much to write about right now so I'm gonna hit the hay we're getting up at the break of dawn. \n\nDay 2 \n\nWe made it The damn thing is fucking gigantic. It's about the size of the empire state building, how the hell we didn't see the damn thing from before entering the forest is a mystery but it looks absolutely astonishing. Its a gorgeous shade of crimson red with golden leaves, and the fruit looks like giant apples. The researchers are gushing all over it, they're collecting its car sized leaves and gathering samples from its man sized fruit. Hector, another strike team agent pulled out his knife ant cut off a piece and ate it. The researchers are flipping there shit but he ignores them and keeps eating. We've started to set up base and the others are getting mad at me for just sitting around and writing in this journal so I'm gonna sign off here.\n\n\n\nDay 3 \n\nHoly shit Hector is dead his ears are missing. We all woke up to the sounds of screaming and when we walked outside we all saw Hector lying on the floor shirtless with his throat slit and a knife in his hand. I don't know if he killed himself or if we have a murderer amoug us. we've dug a grave close to the tree and buried him. I don't know what the hell is going on but I'm gonna find out \n\nday 4 \n\never since Hector died we've all be on edge. Well except for the researchers they been carrying on continuing to test samples from the tree. The area we buried Hector has already been taken over by the foliage. I knew the researchers would withhold information from us but they haven't told us anything. every time we try to ask a question we are dismissed and told we aren't paid to ask questions. I was suspicious ot them when we set out on this mission but now I flat out don't trust them. \n\nDay 7 \n\nSo much crazy shit has happened the last few days I didn't have time to write. Those bastard researchers have dug up Hector's grave and have started to experiment with it. we tried to stop them but were told our pay would be docked for any interference with research so we just let them fuck with his body. Around the middle of the night I hear something fucking with the zipper of my tent so I grab my gun and see whats going on and there is see it hectors body crucified to the tree. I march into the researchers station and confront them of this atrocitie. they all look confused and I bring them outside only to see hectors body is gone. I yell at the researchers and ask whats going on and ended up waking the rest of my team. Everyone looking at me like I'm crazy but I know what I saw. Mary another one of my team members escorts me back to my tent and gives me some water and offers to talk. I tell her I'm good and send her back to her tent. the next morning I wake up and see Mary is dead and her fucking eyes are missing. I scream and wake up everyone else. they all rush out to see this horror and start questioning me. I tell them I have no fucking clue what was going on but they say Hasan said \"we all saw me and her go off together last night\". I told them I sent her off but he didn't believe me. he drew his gun and then a researcher tells him to calm down. She says we have no proof that I killed her but we can detain me just to be safe. he agreed and had someone else tie me up while he had his gun still pointed at me. I was side eyed all day and someone even spat on me. nightfall came and they all went into their tents and I started to drift off asleep. I wake up i think an hour later and good God. I felt like someone was watching me I look up. That fucking tree was covered with eyes hundreds no thousands of blood red eyes all staring at me with blackened pupils and they look and God damn they look so fucking angry. I heard whispers telling me to kill myself. I woke up again with my teeth digging into my tongue. I think I was dreaming but it all felt so real. I didn't get a wink of sleep after that and in the morning I veggies for my release. they all said hell no and I asked can I at least go take a shit Hasan said he would take me to he grabs his gun and untied the part of the rope bound to the tree and took me off. when we were far enough away he tells me to shit and I tell him to turn around or is he into that shit. He says fine and turns around. While he's turned around I put my bound hands around his neck and squeeze. I didn't let got until he dropped and even then I kept holding him. I don't know why I did it but I killed him I think this fucking forest is getting to me I grab his knife and cut myself free I sneak back into the camp and grab my shit and leave and here we are now. I'm getting the fuck out if this forest. \n\nday 9 \n\nI haven't slept in 2 days everyone I try to I dream of the tree. It keeps telling me to hurt everyone else it wants me to kill them, slit there throats like how Hector cut it. It wants they're eyes, ears and tongues. It wants me to purify the forest and be its apostle. I just want out of this forest i just want sleep. \n\nday 10 \n\nI finally fell asleep and woke up to howling. I leave my tent and see these humanoid figures approaching my camp. there are 5 of them they have completely black skin and bare the eyes of the tree. 3 of them have these weird bow and arrows. I grab my gun a shoot the 2 unarmed ones they didn't get up so I think I killed them. The last 3 start launching these black orbs at me and I take cover. I fire back hitting 1 in its and and another in its head. The uningured one tries to drag its injured partner behind cover and I pop it in the head. I run over to the last one and it screams at me. It was so loud and ear peirceing and it nearly drove me mad. I get my knife and rip outs it tongue and stab it in its fucking head. I run away hoping reinforcements don't come I find a cave and I'm going to take refuge here for the night I don't think ill get any sleep tonight. \n\nday 11 \n\nI give up. I woke up and in the cave I see the crucified bodies of everyone that has been on the expedition. They're eyes ears and tongues are all gone. More that half of the bodies have bullet wonds and I think I know where from. I killed them, I killed them, I fucking killed them and took what the tree told me too. I don't know how it made me do it but it manipulated my mind and made me kill them. I walked back to the tree and realized that I had been walking for 2 days and I don't know how I made it back so fast. the tree opened up one large singular eye and stared at me. a hole opens up at the base of the tree and I throw all the body parts that I had collected into the hole. They tree spoke to me in my mind. I thanked me for doing its bidding as it would have taken it so much longer to make all of us kill ourselves.

It said that since I had helped it I was free to go and to never return and that I did I left that horrid place and came here to post this to let you all know that the tree has eyes everywhere and that it will always be watching.",

        "text": "First time writing r/nosleep but hey I'll try my best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found something and I regret it. I hope someone finds warning this so they might not make the mistake I did so they don't face what I discovered.\n\nMy name is Carson Lemmas, I was a police officer for the small town of Argos Indiana. In my little town we don't really have any sort of major crimes, perhaps the occasional break in, store theft, or domestic dispute but really we don't have anything major at all. \n\nI had worked as a police officer for most of my life ever since I got done with high school as the only child I never got good enough grades to really get any special career nor did I really desire to do something like that so I figured I could just go into some sort of physical job.   \n\nWhile I didn't have good enough grades to really go to any of my favored colleges I did find interest in some sort of physical work I briefly considered fire fighting but I didn't have the extreme physical strength for that. So I decided on police work. I applied and was accepted into the Fort Wayne Police Academy. So I drove there and paid my tuition and trained to be a police officer. Then started training and managed to get hired. \n\nEventually after 25 years of diligent police work I decided to apply for a transfer back to my home town and with all my outstanding work I was given the chance to transfer to the Argos Police department with my paycheck not coming from the local department but instead the county department so my hometown didn't have really any trouble paying me. One of the reasons I got the job was that I had been involved in 5 major crimes in the past 2 months or so and expertly handled the situations, one of them nearly killing me with a bullet just millimeters from killing me as I went to enter a building thought to contain the suspect.\n\nI had been in Argos for about 2 years at this point and nothing really new had happened other than the occasional normal petty disputes, theft and stopping sometimes ticketing speeding drivers.  I was making the rounds in the nearby countryside in my old beat up cruiser heading further north into some trees when I spotted what looked to be a crashed truck. \n\nI pulled over and to examine it after notifying dispatch and when i looked at and in it I noticed everything was old as if it had been there for some time. Nothing however was of interest so I went to get the license plate number and when I had written it down I went and checked the truck and area again, and there was nothing. \n\nI got back in my cruiser and started driving back doing my rounds and eventually forgot about the crash site and it didn't enter my mind again until the next week when I was doing my round again in my cruiser. When by the same stretch road I noticed the truck. It came back to me that I had found this truck and forgot to check the plate number before reporting it to see if there were any matches to who owned it so I could let them know it would be towed away soon if they didn't get it out of there. \n\nWhen I checked I found it belonged to a guy some far off the main road further into the more wooded countryside. I let dispatch know that I was going to go give the guy a warning about moving the truck after I was done with my rounds and dispatch gave their usual official version of okay. So I finished my rounds when I went to the guys house to let him know. Except when I got there all I saw was a slightly dilapidated house with a pretty similar truck in the driveway. \n\nWhen I went to let the guy know that we were going to tow his truck if he didn't get it moved. He asked for the plate number and when I gave it to him he seemed confused as the license plate number was for the truck in the driveway when I checked I was confused. So I thought for a few seconds on what to do. \n\nI decided to go talk to dispatch and get some orders on what to do as I had always been more thoughtful in asking for permission rather than doing something immediately. When I asked dispatch they told me to reexamine the crash site when I was heading back.  So I bade the man a fair evening before getting back in my cruiser to go look for the crash site. \n\nWhen I arrived back on the scene of the crashed truck I found something truly confusing, the truck was there but this time there were footsteps leading into the forest. I looked through the truck once more and nothing had changed nothing was different with the license plate it was the exact same license plate on the truck in that man's driveway. \n\nOnly one thing was new and that was there were footsteps leading into the forest. I made to contact dispatch only to find my radio was filled with static rather than the usual feedback from the dispatch assistant replying to the channel.  Confused and uneasy I tried for dispatch again the same static was there. Unsure of what to do I cautiously decided to see where the footsteps led to see if there was anyone who had thought to steal the truck or break it down for spare parts. \n\nAs I was walking with my pistol raised in hand pointing up to avoid checking anyone with a barrel unless for self defense or if I needed to make someone cease and desist.  As I followed the footsteps something made me feel even more uneasy as I kept walking eventually I opened up to what seemed like a small break in the trees only to find the same clearing with the same truck.  \n\nMy cruiser was gone however when I quickly went to turn around to check where I had come from I found only unchanged forest where there had been footsteps not even the ground where I knew I had walked was disturbed by passing through as if I had never walked through in the first place. \n\nSomething was seriously wrong and against all instinct to bolt I cautiously made my way up to the truck and when I looked around it something was inside. When I opened the truck to see what it was I found a sheet of paper but nothing was on it. When I looked up I saw that there were footsteps in the dirt, the same footsteps I had followed when I came back.  \n\nWith that I started to run back where I had come from yet as I was running back through the forest I came back upon the the same scene with the same truck only the paper in the truck this time was different on the paper was a picture. \n\nWhen I saw it my blood went cold, on it was a picture of me at the front door of the mans house talking to him about the truck only the man wasn't a man.  His twisted features were beyond imagination try to think an eldritch grey root or tentacle like being attempting to become humanoid with only the rough shape of a human body to know what a human looks like yet still be recognizable as some sort of humanoid. I can begin to only describe its eyes and expression. \n\nThe eyes were like Fog and flesh melded together and the smile was one of wicked pleasure, one that was of a predator finding its prey. \n\nWhen I looked back up I was frantically looking around as if it was near yet I saw nothing but the same empty forest clearing where the truck was although my cruiser was still missing. I started to follow the road running to get away from that clearing only to find myself somewhere completely different. I had been running the route for 2 years weekly so I knew my way around the roads in the area but I found myself in a completely different area with new intersections, roads and dilapidated houses and a fog obscuring my view about 1000 feet off in every direction. \n\nStill I kept going determined to get out of whatever I was in. Yet all I managed to find was again a completely different area from what I expected. At this point the previous fear from what I saw early was fading and only a deep unease pervaded me so I slowed down to process what I was in and what was going on around me and holstered my pistol. \n\nAt this point 2 hours had passed so I was looking for what I could do I checked the houses and all I found were a few cans of preserved foods and bottles of water so I wouldn't starve or go thirsty if I could escape whatever was happening. I was beginning to become tired after all that happened today as dusk started to set in so I decided to try to get some sleep and see if I could find out what was happening in the morning. \n\nSo before the sun fully went down I went to search for any sort of matting so I wouldn't have to sleep on hard floor and found a mattress and two blankets in one of the nearby houses and made myself comfortable in the one I found that was the most sturdy and drifted off into a dreamless sleep. \n\nWhen I woke up I woke to find myself in darkness switching on the small hand cranked emergency flashlight I always kept on myself. I found myself in the same house on the same mattress with the same blankets I had gone to sleep with but now something was different.  \n\nAs I flicked the flashlight around I saw nothing so when I moved to the windows  and checked I was greeted to pure and utter terror barely a 1000 feet in front of me was the monster in the picture. Its eyes were misty and foggy yet somehow looking almost flesh like in appearance the grin twisted up on its contorted and eldritch face. Yet I knew when I was looking at it, it was somehow looking back directly at me with its inhuman eyes. \n\nI felt fear, more fear than I had ever felt before, more fear than I had felt when my mother comforted me when i was still afraid of the dark. Fear so strong that after an eternal second I started to run as hard as i could away from that thing. \n\nAs I ran I could feel it slowly following me as I ran farther and farther away from it I hid inside one of the new houses in this supernatural area and found this paper and pencil, something tells me it knows where i am hiding and is savoring my fear as if it knows I cannot escape it and can only run as far as it lets me run. I don't know how much time left before it kills me I can only hope it lets me live for a little longer so I can finish this warning.\n\nIf you see the crashed truck do NOT stop to look at it and do NOT return. For I found something that I regret finding. Even now barely after an hour of running away from it in fear, I know I will never find a way to survive this place until I can no longer run to escape, it won't let me run for much longer after all whats the point of playing with food for so long.",

        "text": "[Grace was gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/118azzi/i_had_a_house_that_eats_the_dead_it_wasnt_the/), and no one in the world could help me. I didn’t know if I had minutes or hours, but I knew exactly how it would go if I talked to the police. \n\nI’d be bawling, telling them about the Crone, her old car, everything that had happened. And then all at once, we’d all forget Grace had ever existed. We’d look at each other awkwardly, not quite knowing what we were just talking about. And then they’d leave, and I’d go happily on with my life, forgetting I’d ever had a daughter in the first place.\n\nThere was only one place I could turn to, and it wasn’t a person: my house. I dropped Derek off with Amy, promising I’d explain everything later. Then I headed home.\n\n“I need you,” I said as I got inside. “Anything you can do. Maybe you’ve got some kind of psychic link to other houses like you. Maybe you can eat the floorboards and make letters to tell me something. Maybe you can just magically teleport me where she is. Please. Anything. For Grace. I’m begging you.”\n\nI felt crazy.. Delirious. Of course, these were all just guesses. For all I knew, the house didn’t even fully speak English or have any abilities beyond basic consumption. \n\nI had never prayed, but then, I’d never really believed in anything. But I believed in my house. I fell to my knees, begging.\n\n“Please,” I said. “Please.”\n\nI didn’t know what I was asking.\n\nSlowly, the house began to shake, little vibrations rattling from its foundation to its attic. At first the tremors were small, but then they began to grow, great heaves. \n\nAnd as the smell of bile filled the air, I realized what was happening: my house was throwing up.\n\nI walked through the rooms and halls, following the rancid waft of vomit, until I realized what I should have known all along. It was emanating from the basement. I ran down, holding my breath the whole way. As I did, the house gave one last great heave, shattering every window.\n\nI raised an arm to my eyes, trying to protect myself from the falling glass. Then, when I looked up, I saw something in the hot spot, a tiny quivering lump.\n\nWhen I approached, I saw feathers soaked in stomach acid. Then I recognized the bird. It had been the very one the Crone sacrificed to the house when she visited. \n\nNow, looking half dead and soaked in the house’s acid, the bird took a hesitant step and fell. It got up and took another. Finally, it grew steady and looked up at me with the one good eye that had made it back from the other side. \n\n“Help me,” I said. “Find Grace.”\n\nThe bird shook its feathers, a fine mist flying off in all directions. Then it flew out the window, barely making the ascent.\n\nI sprinted up the stairs and ran outside, spotting the bird as it cleared my rooftop. It was headed northwest, weaving a little through the rain, but definitely headed in that direction. I got in the car and began to follow. \n\nAs I followed the bird, I ran every red light and stop sign. I went the wrong way on one way streets. I didn’t care. Whatever kept me on course. Every second, I thought of Grace, holding onto her memory in my mind as if that very act would keep her from disappearing.\n\nI’m sure I would have hit a semi and died if I’d had to drive far. Lucky for me, the drive wasn’t far. Less than a mile from home, the bird suddenly stopped and fell from the sky. It landed in a dead lump in the middle of the street. \n\nSomehow, I’d ended up in a quiet neighborhood I’d never visited before. Two long rows of upscale houses lined the sides, leading down to a pleasant cul de sac. The neighborhood must have been filled with children: tricycles and playhouses littered the front yards, and minivans parked in nearly every driveway.\n\nNot knowing where to go next, I ran to the closest house and knocked on the door. After a few minutes, a gaunt looking woman answered it. She had a thousand yard stare, and her breath stank of wine.\n\n“I need help,” I said. “I’m looking for my daughter.”\n\n“I’ve always wanted a daughter,” she said, kind of dreamily.\n\nI looked out at her lawn at a pink bike.\n\n“Whose is that?” I asked, and she shrugged.\n\n“No one’s, I guess. Been there a few weeks now. I didn’t want to throw it out. I guess I thought the little girl who it belongs to might come back and get it sometime. But I just wait and wait and wait…”\n\n“Listen,” I said. “I need you to think. Is there an old woman that lives in this neighborhood? One that drives an old Buick?”\n\n“Oh, you mean Sara White? Such a sweetheart. Always baking treats for the neighborhood.”\n\n“Which house is she in?”\n\n“The one at the end of the street,” she said. “The one with the roses. Can’t miss it.”\n\nShe paused for a second.\n\n“Do you think that little girl will ever come back for her bike? Maybe your daughter would want it. If you ever find it. You can take it if you want. I don’t think that girl is coming back, now that I’m talking about it.”\n\nShe looked off, lost in thought again and repeated, “I’ve always wanted a daughter.”\n\nThe house wasn’t hard to find. Even pelted with rain, the Crone’s house was yellow and bright, bursting with roses everywhere. On the way there, I grabbed a hunting knife from the trunk of my car–I’d acquired a few good ones now, and had gotten good at using them.\n\nThe Crone’s door was unlocked. I opened it and walked in. As I did, the overpowering smell of cookies washed over me, and not in a good way. The air was thick with sugar, and definitely too warm, like I was in a baker’s oven.\n\n“Grace!” I shouted, and I heard a whimper from a room down the hall. Without even thinking about it, I ran toward her. Stupid.\n\nOf course, the Crone was waiting just at the side of the doorway as I entered, crouched with her own knife. I heard it before I felt it, a meaty squelch as the blade pierced my abdomen. Blood poured from the wound as I fell to the ground. The Crone backed up, practically gleeful.\n\n“You mothers are all the same when it comes to your little ones,” she said. “That’s what makes it so easy.”\n\nAnd for a second, the fear took me. I could see it all playing out as the Crone had planned. I’d disappear into nothing, then Grace soon after. Derek would be next. All of us gone forever, erased for eternity. \n\nThe blood poured from my wound, and I saw all of our futures slipping away, ready to avoid the hundred other children she’d already erased.\n\nThen I looked across the room to see Grace. She was tied to a chair and placed at a table laden with cakes and pies, cookies and candies. Her face was smeared with chocolates and crumbs. She looked alive, but half asleep.\n\n“Oh, don’t worry,” said the Crone. “She’s almost ready. Almost stuffed. And my oven… my oven is heating up nicely.”\n\nShe took a hesitant step toward me, kitchen knife in hand.\n\n“I suppose I should ask how you found me,” she said. “These houses are so funny aren’t they? They do surprise you with their… abilities. Even after all this time, I’m still getting to know mine. And we’ve been together for a long, long time.”\n\nAs she spoke, I got to my feet, knife in hand. The Crone took a step back, suddenly less sure of herself.\n\n“You’re stronger than you look,” she said. “I’ll give you that. Just how much have you been feeding that thing?” \n\nIt was true. Over the last few months, as I’d fed the house man after man, I’d noticed it was easier to lift the kids on the way to bed and that I no longer got winded on the stairs. \n\nI took a step toward her, knife out.\n\n“I’ve gotten to be something of an expert at stabbing people,” I told her. “I ever took the time to study some basic human anatomy. Now, if I were a little shorter. Say, the height of a child, that stab you gave me probably would have been fatal. Probably would have torn my liver right in half. But the the thing is, bitch, I’m not a child. I’m a full grown woman.”\n\nAnd then I lunged at her, stabbing forward. She brought up her hand to protect herself, and my blade went right through it. She drew her hand back, screaming. We were both dripping blood now. It was pooling at our feet as we assessed each other. \n\n“I’m going to kill you,” I said. “Just like the rest of them. And then I’m going to feed you to your own house.”\n\n“I told you before,” she said, holding up her blade. “Mine has very particular tastes.”\n\nI nodded at her feet, where the blood was quickly disappearing. A faint scratching sound filled the air.\n\n“Or maybe it’s just you,” I said. “Maybe there’s something vile you like to do. Something you like to blame on the house. Maybe you’re the one who likes children.”\n\nAs the words left my mouth, she screamed and lunged at me. It was exactly what I wanted. I easily dodged her swing and plunged my knife into her chest, right into her heart. She fell into a bloody lump on the floor. \n\nAs she bled out, her house continued to drink. Maybe it had been hungry for her for a long time. I’d never seen my own house eat so fast. Her body couldn’t have lasted more than a few seconds before she disappeared.\n\nI ran to Grace and untied her. As soon as she got up from the chair, she threw up everywhere. Then she looked at me with wide eyes.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “She made me eat. I didn’t even want to. She made me.”\n\n“I know,” I said. “I know.”\n\nI looked all around us. The kitchen was like nothing I’d ever seen before. There were maybe four or five ovens, a couple of them twice the size of mine at home. There were also three fridges, a walk-in pantry, and a deep fryer. \n\nI didn’t want to think about how the Crone had used everything in here. How old had she been? And how many children had she fed to the house? \n\nIt wasn’t the house’s fault. I genuinely believed that. Like Aaron had used to say, it was just a tool, one with a bad master. At the same time, I wasn’t sure who would wind up on its deed next. For all I knew, the Crone had a sister or a nephew with the exact same appetites, all ready to inherit it next.\n\nAnd so I did the only thing that made sense. I turned on every burner on every gas stove to max. And then I took the gallons and gallons of cooking oil I found in the pantry and threw it everywhere. \n\nThe house tried to slurp it all up, but there was just too much to consume. \n\n“I’m sorry,” I told it. “It’s not your fault. But you’re just too dangerous. I hope you’ll forgive me.”\n\nAnd then I threw in the match.\n\nBy the time Grace and I were halfway to the car, the house was fully ablaze. And somewhere, beyond the sounds of breaking glass and crashing beams, I heard what I could only guess was the house screaming. It was a sound I’ll never forget, like a trillion cicadas all dying at once.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the house. Because as it died, so did its forgetting. And all through the neighborhood, all through the city, a hundred moms and dads suddenly ran to their windows, screaming into the dark as the memories hit in a tidal wave. \n\nStep after step, I heard them calling out their names.\n\n“Abby!”\n\n“Pete!”\n\n“Maresha!”\n\n“Darius!”\n\nName after name screamed into the falling rain. And as I looked back into the flames behind me, I swear I saw a hundred small silhouettes looking out from the flames, watching me as I carried my beautiful, living Grace back to the car.\n\nBy the time I got Grace and Derek both home, the rain had cut through the broken windows, soaking the house to its bones. Though the wind howled, inside it was strangely quiet. I plucked a few flowers from outside and left them in a hot spot, but they didn’t wilt a bit. \n\nWhat had I asked when I told it to find Grace? What had the house given up?\n\n“Eat,” I told it, but it felt like I was shouting into a canyon, listening to my own echo.\n\nHad I killed two houses, mine and hers? I sat in a ball, holding the children, weeping.\n\n“You’re bleeding, mom,” said Derek. “You need to go to the hospital.”\n\n“I know,” I said. “I know.”\n\nAnd then I had one last idea. I walked over to the hot spot, standing right inside it, and let the blood and tears drip down. \n\n“Please,” I said. “Please.” And I waited and waited, [praying the blood would disappear.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

        "text": "Something has gone wrong. And I’m not entirely certain what to do next. I have written here before ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10unu0x/the_last_resort/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10y9aaq/the_last_resort_the_house_always_wins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11441tm/the_last_resort_murder_mystery_weekend/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) and so, I thought perhaps someone here might have some advice, some idea of what to do next. Maybe it is a slim hope, but I have to try. First, I suppose I should explain what led up to this, so you understand. \n\nI cut the engine on the lawnmower and looked over to see how Vincent was getting along trimming the hedges. Hearing the silence, he paused his work and leaned the hedge trimmers against the fence. \n\n“What do you think?”\n\nI squinted up at the lumpy ornamental tree,\n\n“What is it supposed to be?”\n\n“It’s a horse,” he crossed his arms, frowning. “Rearing up, majestically.”\n\n“Why does it have 5 legs?”\n\n“One is the tail.”\n\n“Right… Maybe you should stick to the standard cube and sphere shapes, Vincent.”\n\nHe paused to study his handiwork for a moment,\n\n“You might be right. Apparently shaping topiary isn’t one of my skills.”\n\n“Well, we can probably find you a different job to do. Maybe something that suits you better. Which reminds me, I never asked, what did you do before you came here?”\n\n“I was a lawyer.”\n\n“That is going to be helpful,” I rolled my eyes. \n\n“Well, what did you do before? You have a lot of hospitality experience?”\n\n“Oh, I’ve worked at a few hotels,” I shrugged. “Also, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, that sort of thing. I moved around a lot, took jobs where I could get them.”\n\n“What, were you on the run from the law or something?”\n\n“No, nothing like that. I guess I was just… drifting. From place to place, through life. Nowhere I went felt *right*, you know? Maybe it’s no wonder I eventually ended up here.”\n\n“Do you want to talk about…”\n\n“Maybe you can help with the bookkeeping?” I interrupted, pushing the conversation onward.\n\n“Bookkeeping?” he raised an eyebrow. “This place keeps books? Why? Do people even actually pay? Do we get audited? Pay taxes? In fact, that brings up a more important question: why is *any* of this necessary? I’ve seen this place generate space and people out of nothing. Why does it need cleaning or maintenance or bookkeeping *at all*?”\n\nI stared at him for a moment, then laughed,\n\n“Need? Obviously this place doesn’t *need* us at all. I’m pretty sure they just like fucking with us,” I shrugged. “Sometimes, I go into rooms that no one has been using, or maybe even rooms that didn’t exist yesterday, and find wet towels, chips tracked into the carpet, dirty dishes. Look, just find something to do, don’t worry about why you have to do it. It helps to keep busy, anyway.”\n\nI pushed the lawnmower into the shed and motioned for Vincent to follow, we crossed the now neatly manicured lawn, heading back towards the hotel. As we reached the pool, I saw the Masseur standing out front of the spa, staring at us. I looked away, avoiding eye contact, and made to pass him quickly, but then I heard Vincent gasp and stop in his tracks. \n\n“Jason?”\n\nI turned back, keeping my eyes on the ground.\n\n“Keep walking,” I said softly. “You shouldn’t talk to the permanent staff.”\n\n“No, that’s…” he took a step towards the spa. “Jason, when did you get here?”\n\nI grabbed his arm and pulled him back to the path,\n\n“Whoever you think that is, it isn’t. That’s the Masseur from the spa, and you do not want to follow him. Look away, keep walking.”\n\nHe resisted for a moment, but finally relented and followed me inside. Once I was sure we were alone, I turned back to him. \n\n“You alright?”\n\n“That was Jason,” he said softly, still looking back over his shoulder, back the way we had come. “I haven’t seen him since I left. Since he asked me to move out. I… need to go back and talk to him.”\n\n“The permanent staff do that sometimes. They can take different forms. Mostly, you should just try and avoid them. *Definitely* do not go back.”\n\n“But what if it was really…”\n\n“Vincent, I was standing right next to you. All I saw was the Masseur, same as usual.”\n\nHe sank into one of the lobby chairs,\n\n“Why him, though. Of all people?”\n\n“Usually, it is someone tied to why you are here, in some way. Someone important.”\n\n“Yeah, I guess you could say that,” he paused and considered my words for a moment. “Alright, I won’t go back out there, I won’t go find him. Now that I think about it, something was off. He looked like Jason, but he didn’t move like him, you know? I think I just… really wanted to see him again. There are things I need to explain,” he paused, as if he wanted to say more, but then sighed. “It doesn’t matter. We should get back to work. You were going to show me to books, right? Let’s just, focus on that.”\n\n“Alright,” I nodded. “Let’s go to the office.”\n\nI had finished showing him the computer system and was just about to open up the safe when I heard the bell. Vincent stiffened and his head whipped towards the door, it was an uncanny impression of the way a rabbit looks at an oncoming car. \n\n“Guests?” he asked quietly. \n\n“Seems like it.”\n\n“Do you think that is going to be a problem?”\n\n“It’s always a problem. I’m not sure if you noticed, but there are no ‘normal’ guests here. Either way, it’s our job to check them in, so let’s get to it. Remember, customer service smile,” I demonstrated.\n\nVincent managed to paste on a weak smile and followed me out into the lobby. There were two men at the desk. They were both clearly anxious about something, their eyes darted back and forth like animals being hunted. The taller one on the left had a stain on the cuff of the jacket that looked suspiciously like blood, and the man next to him was pale and sweaty, and he was leaning on the counter for support. \n\n“Good afternoon, gentlemen. Welcome to Ultima Resort. What can I do for you today?”\n\nThe taller man stepped forward,\n\n“We need a pair of adjoining rooms,” he spoke more loudly than I was expecting. \n\n“Of course, sir. For how long?”\n\n“It’s… open ended at the moment, will that be a problem?”\n\n“No, we just need a credit card up front.”\n\nAs he fished out his wallet, I heard a metallic clink as something hit the lobby floor, but the man didn’t seem to notice. He passed the card to me,\n\n“OK, Mr. Smith, and Mr.…” I prompted them for a name to put on the second room.\n\n“Johnson,” the shorter man mumbled, after a brief hesitation. \n\n“Of course,” I smiled and typed in the obviously fake names. What difference did it make to me? “We’ll see you to your rooms.”\n\nManny had emerged from the back by then, and he lifted the cases without preamble and headed upstairs. As Mr. Johnson stepped away, I saw the bloody handprint on the desk where he had been leaning on it. I pulled out a rag and wiped it away quickly. As I did, Vincent stepped around the counter and bent down to retrieve something from the floor. When he straightened, he deposited a shell casing on the counter. \n\n“Should we be doing something about this?” he asked.\n\n“About what?”\n\n“About the lunatic with a gun who just checked in with a guy that should be in the hospital?”\n\n“You want to offer him first aid or something?”\n\n“Maybe we should find out if he is a hostage? If the guy with him shot him?”\n\n“It really is better not to get involved,” Manny strolled up to the desk. “No good comes from inserting yourself into the problems of the people here. You just need to stay out of their way and hope they don’t drag you down with them.”\n\n“That Johnson guy was *bleeding*,” Vincent protested. \n\n“But he seemed more anxious than frightened,” I noted. “He was eager to go off with his friend, and get out from under our prying eyes. I don’t think he is a hostage, I think they are both on the run from something. Something that prevented him from going to a hospital.”\n\n“What makes you say that?”\n\n“It happens a lot here, you get used to it.”\n\nManny nodded in agreement. Vincent looked like he might try to argue further, but after a moment of massaging his temples, he finally said,\n\n“I just have a bad feeling about this.”\n\n“Yeah, no shit. You don’t need to be a psychic to figure that out.”\n\nVincent sighed,\n\n“Ok. Well… if no one else has a problem with this, I guess we should get back to work, then.”\n\n“That’s the spirit,” Manny clapped him on the shoulder. “I’ll be in the garden if either of you need me. I was just looking out the window on my way down, and something is really wrong with one of the trees.”\n\nFor several days, it looked like Vincent’s prediction was going to be wrong. The two guests holed up in their rooms and I didn’t see hide nor hair of them. They ordered room service for every meal and had it left at the door, they refused all cleaning service, and I never saw them in the halls. They certainly weren’t coming down to use the pool. On the fourth day after their arrival, I headed upstairs in the evening to check on the room, expecting to see the Do Not Disturb sign firmly in place, but I was surprised to find it absent. Maybe they finally wanted clean sheets. I knocked, but no one answered, so I used my key to enter the room. The smell hit me first. The sickly sweet odor of rot and the copper tang of blood mingled into a toxic cloud that filled the room. I flipped on the light fully expecting to find a body, but my first glance didn’t reveal one. Still, the source of the smell was clear enough, the bed sheets and towels were piled on the bed, stained with blood and greenish pus. There were bandages and other first aid supplies piled in the overflowing garbage can. It looked like at least one man, Johnson probably, must be seriously injured and they were clearly trying to deal with it themselves. I checked around the room for any sign of his body, but there was no one, dead or alive, in the room. So, lacking anything better to do, I got to work cleaning up the soiled sheets and towels and replacing them with fresh ones, and opening the windows to air out the room. \n\nOnce the heavy cleaning was done, I opened the mini fridge to restock the snacks and ice. I pulled out the ice cube tray and nearly dropped it. Tucked neatly into the tray was one of the largest diamonds I had ever seen, it was the size of the tip of my thumb and was faintly blue in color. I stared at it for a long moment, unsure of what to do next. Then, I heard the sound of the door opening. I shoved the ice tray back into the freezer and spun to find the two guests in the doorway, staring at me. \n\n“You didn’t put the sign on the door, idiot?” Smith barked at his companion. \n\nJohnson was still alive, which actually surprised me a bit, and the way he looked, I guessed it surprised him, too. I had never seen a person look so pale; he was almost green. His eyes were red-rimmed, and his hair was wet with sweat. I was guessing, based on the state of his discarded medical supplies, that he had a serious infection and was probably running a high fever. \n\n“You were supposed to hang it, don’t blame this on me.”\n\nI started to move towards the door, \n\n“I apologize if I intruded, I was just cleaning the room. I will get out of your way.”\n\nSmith produced a gun,\n\n“I would prefer you stay very still.”\n\nI raised my hands,\n\n“Please, I don’t know what this is about.”\n\n“Check the freezer,” Smith barked, waving Johnson forward with the barrel of the gun.\n\nJohnson limped past me and opened the fridge. I heard him pull out the ice cube tray and sigh in relief. \n\n“It’s here.”\n\nThe man with the gun relaxed slightly and lowered the weapon,\n\n“We won’t be needing housekeeping for the duration of our stay, don’t come back.”\n\nI nodded and scrambled from the room before he could change his mind. I heard the door slam and lock behind me. As I leaned against the wall, trying to get my knees to stop shaking so I could get back down the stairs, I could hear them arguing through the door. \n\n“I don’t think she saw it. If she had, she would have taken it.”\n\n“You don’t know that. She might be planning to come back for it later. We need to move it tonight,” Smith growled.\n\n“Tonight? We didn’t find a good spot for it, though. Where are we going to put it?”\n\n“We’ll just have to keep looking. We can’t stay here any longer. Even if she didn’t see it, I pulled a gun, she’ll call the cops on us for sure, and if they get here and find us here with the stone…”\n\n“You’re right, we have to hide it, somewhere it can’t be found and can’t be tied to us. Let’s go.”\n\n“Maybe you should rest, and I’ll keep looking. You are in pretty rough shape, Sam.”\n\n“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Make sure I don’t know where it’s hidden, so you can come back for it without me?”\n\n“The fever is making you paranoid. We’re in this together, I wouldn’t betray you.”\n\n“Right, like you didn’t betray Carl?”\n\n“What happened with Carl wasn’t my fault, I told you. He shot that guard, the guard shot back. There was nothing I could have done to save him.”\n\n“It just seems awfully convenient that you are the only one who got out of there without a new piercing, Steve.”\n\n“You wouldn’t have gotten shot either, if you’d listened to me and stayed down. I wouldn’t have left without you.”\n\n“Sure,” Sam huffed. “Look, we don’t have time for this. We need to find a place to hide it while we wait for the heat to die down, and you aren’t doing it without me, so let’s just get it done. I’ll feel better once it is out of our hands anyway. You know what they say about diamonds cut from the French Blue, right?” \n\n“Come on, you don’t believe in curses, do you?”\n\nI heard the door handle turn and I ducked into the room next door. When I was sure they were gone, I bolted back downstairs. I needed to warn Vincent to stay away from the two new guests, because they were clearly dangerous at the best of times and this place likely only made that worse. If they thought we would turn them in, or that we were after their diamond, they might kill us all. Manny would avoid them as a matter of course, so I didn’t worry too much about him. I sprinted into the dining room to find Vincent sitting at one of the tables, he jumped when he heard me, shoving his phone into his pocket and swiping his sleeve across his face. \n\n“Are you alright?” I asked, collapsing into a chair, distracted for the moment by his obvious distress.\n\n“Yeah, I’m good I just…” he searched for an explanation. “Screw it, I’m obviously not. I saw him again.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Jason. The Masseur. Whatever. I was out cleaning the pool. I tried to ignore him, but his eyes… I could feel him staring, feel his anger.”\n\n“Did you talk to him?”\n\n“No, but I wanted to. I wanted to explain, to apologize, to… I don’t know. To make it right? But I can’t make it right, can I?”\n\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know what you mean.”\n\n“Of course you don’t. I never explained. Though, come to think of it, you never asked. Which is odd. Aren’t you curious, how I ended up in a place like this?”\n\n“Manny always says curiosity is dangerous. He thinks it is better never to discuss anything about our pasts, act like everything is normal, like we are just doing a job. I guess it’s just been me and him for so long, I’ve stopped even trying to ask.”\n\n“Do *you* think it is dangerous?”\n\n“I don’t know. It might be. But it might also be dangerous to bottle it up. Maybe sometimes, there are things that need to be said. So, if there is something you want to get off your chest, I’ll listen.”\n\n“Thanks, I… maybe that will help. Where do I even start? Well, Jason is my fiancé. My ex-fiancé, I suppose. I met him in law school. We were soulmates, the perfect couple. That’s why I proposed last summer. When he said yes, I thought that was it. I had my dream job and my dream man, and my life was going to be perfect. But a few weeks ago, we had a… misunderstanding, of sorts, about money. He kicked me out. He said I broke his trust, that he couldn’t be with me anymore. He ended our engagement. But it was an overreaction, we could have worked things out. We *will* work things out, once I can apologize, and explain properly. I only used his credit cards because mine were maxed out. It was a temporary thing. I just needed 20k, hardly anything, enough to cover a few bets. They were sure things, no way to lose. And I was going to pay him back, every dollar, as soon as I turned things around. He wasn’t supposed to even notice,” Vincent shook his head, frustrated. “I can still make things right with him. I just need a way to make the money back. If I could pay him back, everything would go back to normal. That’s why it’s so hard to keep seeing him here. Because I feel like if he really was here, if I could just explain…” he trailed off. \n\nI suddenly understood why Manny was so reluctant to talk about this sort of thing. What do you say to that? That money can’t fix every problem? That some things, once broken, can’t ever be repaired? That probably wouldn’t be helpful, so I opted for sympathetic noises and a hand on his arm. There was a long, awkward silence, then finally he turned to me and asked, \n\n“Why did you come running in here, anyway? I thought you were cleaning the rooms upstairs.”\n\n“Oh! I almost forgot!” \n\nI filled him in quickly on what I had witnessed. \n\n“A giant diamond?” his eyes were wide and eager.\n\n“Really, that is what you took away from this?” I raised an eyebrow.\n\n“Do you know how much a diamond that size, and a blue one at that, would be worth? It sounds like it must have been at least 5 carats. That’s hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe more if it has an interesting history. You weren’t even tempted to just… take it?”\n\n“Of course not. What would I even have to spend it on here?”\n\n“Yeah, but when you get out…”\n\n“I am certainly not going to steal from two men who have already killed at least once for this diamond, are you insane? I told you so you would stay away from them. Besides, they said they were going to find another hiding spot. So don’t even think about it.” \n\n“Still, if we could just…”\n\n“Nope. I am sorry I ever mentioned it. You should stay away from that diamond, Vincent. You are going to get yourself shot, or worse.”\n\n“Worse?”\n\n“They said something about the diamond being cursed. That is was cut from something called the French Blue.”\n\n“The French Blue?!” Vincent exclaimed, loudly enough that I clapped a hand over his mouth. \n\nThe thieves could be anywhere right now and if they overheard, I doubted it would end well for us. He pushed my hand away,\n\n“Do you know what the French Blue is?” he asked. I shook my head. “It was owned by Louis the XIV before it was stolen during the French revolution and cut into smaller stones, including the Hope Diamond. It is one of the most famous diamonds in the world.”\n\n“And cursed?”\n\n“There were rumors of a curse. It was supposed to bring misfortune and a painful death to those that owned it. But that is nonsense, you don’t believe in curses, do you?”\n\n“I didn’t until I ended up here. Now, it seems a little but foolish to tempt fate.”\n\n“That is an excellent point, actually.”\n\n“Look, just don’t do anything stupid, Vincent. Money isn’t worth much, trapped in this place. And we don’t have any special privileges as staff, no protection, no immortality. People like us get killed by the guests more often than you would think. Just take my word on it, and do not mess with those guys or their diamond.”\n\n“You are right, of course,” he sighed. “It just seems too perfect…”\n\nJust then, the door swung open, and the two guests strolled into the dining room. They hadn’t taken a meal out of their room since they arrived, so it was a surprise to see them here, and not a pleasant one. Sam limped to a chair and collapsed into it. He was looking very unwell. Steve brought him a glass of water, but when he offered it, Sam slapped it out of his hand, shattering the glass on the floor. \n\n“I’m not touching any food you bring me,” Sam rasped. “You don’t think I know what you are doing? You don’t think I know you’ve been poisoning me this entire time? Pretending to nurse me back to health, but really just making me sicker, and sicker. Then you’ll be the last one left. You want it all to yourself, but you won’t get it.”\n\n“Shut up, Sam. You are talking crazy. No one is trying to kill you.”\n\n“Don’t deny it, I know the truth. But it isn’t your fault, Steve. It isn’t your fault,” his eyes were too bright and his tone frantic as he spoke. “It’s the diamond, you know. It’s the curse. I know, because it told me.”\n\n“There are no diamonds, Sam. You need to drink some water, you are burning up, hallucinating.”\n\n“No, no, no,” Sam grabbed his companion’s shirt, pulling him closer. “This all started with the diamond. With the heist. We stole it, so now we own it, and that means we own the curse. Don’t you see? First Carl died…”\n\n“Carl was stupid, he got caught and he got shot. He didn’t even have the diamond on him.”\n\n“Doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. The diamond knew. It knew what we were planning. Then I got shot, and now I am wasting away. You are making sure of it. But that’s a mistake, Steve, because once I die, it will come for you. We need to get rid of it. I thought we could just hide it, but it told me that isn’t enough. We need to get it far away from us, to get free of the curse.”\n\nSteve pulled himself from Sam’s grip and stumbled back, but as he did, Sam raised a hand to reveal the blue diamond, plucked from wherever Steve had secreted it. He held it aloft triumphantly for just a moment, and both Steve and Vincent stared, seeming to be mesmerized by the jewel. Nobody moved for a long moment, and then Sam jumped from his chair and sprinted from the room at a speed it didn’t seem he should be capable of. Without hesitation, Vincent and Steve chased after him. By the time I even realized what was happening and followed out into the lobby, they were nowhere in sight. I hit the button to call Manny. \n\n“What happened?”\n\nI briefly recapped what had led to the three men running off, deeper into the hotel. \n\n“So, what do we do now?” \n\n“I’m not sure there is anything we can do,” Manny shrugged. “They’ll sort it out and come back, or they won’t.”\n\n“That’s very helpful, thank you.”\n\n“I told you not to get too attached. To the guests or to the staff. Odds are they will die, or worse. You need to keep your distance.”\n\n“I’m going to go outside, maybe I can spot them from one of the windows.”\n\n“It’s dark out.”\n\n“That will make it easier to see.”\n\n“Suit yourself, Lucy. I am going to bed, I’m going to finish chopping down that damaged tree tomorrow, when the light is better. Hopefully I will see you in the morning.”\n\nManny turned and walked off down the staff hallway. I frowned at his back. It irked me most that he was probably right. I shouldn’t try to go after them, I shouldn’t go outside after dark. Nothing that happened was going to be good and I probably didn’t want to see it. But I couldn’t just leave it like this. So, I headed out the back door and into the garden. The pool glittered in the moonlight, lit from within, it was the brightest object in the night. There were also some dim lanterns through the garden paths, and I followed them out, listening for the dogs, as I made my way out to the hedges on the north corner of the hotel, looking up at the windows. The hotel was not in a cooperative mood, evidently, because I checked all 10 windows, but when I went to scan them again, there were 13. I cursed and kept checking, looking for any sign of movement in the panes that were lit up. As I circled, I passed the tree that Vincent had been working on; Manny had been trying to reshape it all week, but it was clearly dead now. The leaves had fallen away, and it had split down the middle, leaving a jagged blade of twisted wood pointing to the sky. I stared at it in the dim light for a long moment, it looked ugly and frightening in the darkness. I shuddered, and looked away, planning to move as far away from it as I could, but then, a shout drew my attention up to the roof, right above me. I could barely make out the 3 silhouettes in the moonlight, but I could hear the man closest to the edge shouting,\n\n“You’ll see. This is what we need to do. To save ourselves, to save everyone.” \n\nThe voice was Sam, panting and out of breath, but still manic. Something glittered in his hand.\n\n“Come back from the edge, you idiot,” Steve yelled. “We’ll get you to a doctor. You need help.”\n\nThe two silhouettes edged closer to the man on the edge.\n\n“Don’t do anything reckless,” Vincent called out.\n\n“I’m not being reckless. Reckless was trying to steal this cursed stone in the first place. No, now I am setting things right.”\n\n“No!”\n\nI watched as one of the dark shapes lunged towards Sam, just as he pulled his arm back and pitched the glittering shape from the roof into the darkness of the forest. The lunger was too late, they grabbed at Sam, but he jumped away and their momentum carried them to the edge of the roof. For a moment, I thought they might stop in time. They teetered on the edge, arms clawing at the air as though it could stop their fall. But it wasn’t enough, and they slipped, toppling from the roof. I knew what was about to happen. I knew, even as he scrabbled for purchase on the roof, how this would end and I tried to look away, but I couldn’t seem to close my eyes or avert my gaze. All I could do was watch as he landed on the sharp wood of the broken tree in front of me, the wood piercing through his back and erupting from his stomach. The face turned towards me, blood running freely from the nose and mouth. He saw me standing there and feebly reached out a hand,\n\n“Help me,” he whispered. “Please.”\n\nI knew it was Steve. At least, I think I did. But, in that moment, that wasn’t who I saw. And that wasn’t whose hand I was holding when I collapsed, sobbing, to the ground. Rocking back and forth, telling him it was going to be ok. He was going to be alright. When we both knew that he wasn’t. Sam reached the scene first. I didn’t even look up at him, but I heard him when he inspected the body.\n\n“It didn’t work,” he cried. “Getting rid of it wasn’t enough. I have to find it, I have to destroy it, or I’ll die, too.” \n\nHe sprinted off into the dark woods that surrounded the resort. I looked up into the vacant, empty eyes of the man impaled on the tree before me. I knew he was dead. And then, the world fell away into darkness. Not like this, not again. It wasn’t fair. It was too much. I couldn’t bear another moment, another second. I couldn’t. I could feel something crack inside me. The whispers flooded into my mind, dozens of voices, maybe hundreds. Saying all the things I had said to myself so many times over the years. \n\n*You failed him. You can’t ever take it back. Nothing you do will ever make up for it. They are lying when they say they don’t blame you. They all know it was your fault. You know it was your fault. It will never get better. You can never make it right. All you can do is bear it, until the day you finally die. How much longer is that? Wouldn’t it be better to let go? To rest? Why do you want to keep hurting like this?*\n\nAnd then I felt hands on my shoulders, pulling me up. \n\n“Lucy!”\n\nI opened my eyes to Vincent, shaking me by the shoulders,\n\n“Lucy, are you alright?”\n\n“We need to get back inside,” I managed to gasp. \n\nVincent helped me back inside the hotel, he looked genuinely worried. \n\n“What happened out there? Are you hurt?”\n\nI shook my head. \n\n“Who is Anthony?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You were crying and screaming the name ‘Anthony’ over and over. I thought that guy’s name was Steve?”\n\nI wrapped my arms around myself,\n\n“Anthony is my brother. Was my brother,” I replied softly. “I… I can’t talk about this right now. We need to get to our rooms; it is too late to be out like this.”\n\n“Are you sure you are…”\n\n“I’m fine,” I cut him off. “We’ll talk in the morning.”\n\nVincent insisted on walking me to my door. He wanted to make sure I was safe. I don’t know how to tell him I’m not. That I am not sure I ever will be again. I’m too afraid to sleep, so I am sitting here, writing this, trying to distract myself. It is hard to focus, though. Because the truth is, I’m not ok. Something broke in me tonight. And I think it opened me up to something, like a gap in a door letting in the cold breeze. The whispers haven’t stopped. They never stop. I can hear them, even now, chewing at the back of my mind like rodents. They are trying to get in, to take over. How long can I ignore them, resist them, now that they are in my head? So, I guess now we get to the advice I am hoping for. On the off chance anyone here has experience in this sort of thing, do you know how to make the whispers stop? How do you push the demons out of your head, once they already have a foothold? There has to be a way to fix this. I hope. If anyone has any ideas, I am open to trying them. For now, I am just going to distract myself with work, and maybe it will get better with time. I will write again if I can. \n\nLucy",

        "text": "In September of 2009, I was at a wine-hazed afterparty at my friend Micah’s place. I ended up sharing a bottle of white with a stranger. We’d been chatting all night, laughing at everything and nothing. We’d settled ourselves on a balcony with a ridiculous pile of blankets, sofa cushions and pillows. All kinds of cozy.\n\nOther people at the party had come and gone, but we’d stayed there for hours. She was from a small town in Minnesota, but had come to West Virginia for her master’s degree. She was just gonna stay out here in Juniper for a few days to help her friend move. We don’t get a lot of visitors out here.\n\nSomewhere around the 3 am mark, we finished our bottle. She was half asleep on my shoulder, waking herself every now and then with little hiccups.\n\n”When… whenever I get sad, like, really sad, I do this thing,” she said. ”Close your eyes.”\n\n”Sure, yeah,” I nodded.\n\n”I imagine this door. A… a white door. Can you see it?”\n\n”Yeah, yeah.”\n\n”So I open it, and there’s this… this room. But with a dirt floor. Earthy, fresh with… with rain. You gotta, like, smell it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried my best. I was enthralled by the smell of her coconut shampoo, but there was something else there. A tinge of soil, rich with morning dew.\n\n”I smell it, yeah.”\n\n”So… I take what makes me sad, and I put it into a little seed. And then I plant it. I put it away. And later, it… it blooms into this *beautiful* sunflower.”\n\n”So it’s like a big… sunflower room.”\n\n”Yeah, but they get this blue shade,” she smiled. ”Because they’re sad.”\n\n“Are you sad?”\n\nShe smiled and shook her head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stayed awake as long as I could, trying to be a good shoulder for her to sleep on. \n\nAnd by the time I woke up, she was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this was many years ago. It was one of those beautiful early adult memories that just stick with you, which you can look back on whenever life doesn’t seem worth the trouble. When my studies were too much, or I had a bad break-up, or a rough day at work, that memory was my happy place. Back on that balcony, with that gentle weight on my shoulder.\n\nNowadays, I work as a foreman at a local processing plant. Not that glamorous, but it gives me everything I need. You can’t underestimate the value of job security in this market. I certainly don’t.\n\nI have been in a comfortable position for years. I can’t complain. I’ve gotten a bit stuck in a rut, and those days of wine-hazed optimism feels like a bygone age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then one night, I got a stark reminder.\n\nIn that twilight hour between sleep and consciousness, I found myself looking up at the ceiling of my bedroom. The image of a white door came to mind. The same door that beautiful stranger had introduced me to so many years ago. A simple wooden door with white paint peeling off at the edges. A brass knocker that’d started to turn green.\n\nIn my mind’s eye, the door swung open.\n\nBeyond it, was a field of overgrown sunflowers, abandoned for years. Weeds and undergrowth thick enough to form a solid barrier. A sour smell emanated from the room, and I could hear the buzzing off flies. As I reached to close the door, a thorned tendril fell out and wrapped itself around my neck, puncturing my skin.\n\nAs I opened my mouth to scream, a blue sunflower forced itself into my mouth. Rough petals pressing against the back of my tongue.\n\nAnd I woke up, coughing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran into the bathroom, gagging violently. I had this sour taste in my mouth, and a rash around my neck. Little inflamed dots, like I’d been strangled with poison ivy. I couldn’t stop coughing, and my heart was racing. I’d had allergic reactions before, but never something that constricted my breathing. This was a first.\n\nFinally, I felt something dislodge from my lungs. I bent over the sink and forced it out of me. For a few agonizing seconds, it traveled up my throat, and left me.\n\nDozens of sunflower seeds.\n\nBlue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night messed me up. The next day I bought a salve for my neck rash, but I’d already scratched it so bad that I had open wounds. It felt like my body was trying to reject my head. I was more tired than usual, and I kept getting these strange bouts of nausea. On top of it all, and I don’t want to go into graphic detail, but there was blood in places where blood ought not to be.\n\nI took a few days off work and went to see a doctor. They did a few blood tests and concluded that I had gotten an allergic reaction, but they couldn’t tell from what. They urged me to change my sheets and try a new non-perfumed detergent. I also got a prescription for an epinephrine injector in case my throat closed completely.\n\nI spent the rest of the day cleaning, washing, and worrying. And as I went to bed that night, I tried to think about literally anything but that white door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as soon as my head hit the pillow, there it was. And this time, it opened on its’ own. They knew I was coming back, and they were ready for me.\n\nTendrils grabbed me, lifting me up into the ceiling. Towards the white door with the brass knocker. I tried to hold back, getting cuts across my arms and legs. I could feel blisters building on my skin, turning into hundreds of painful little pearls. I felt my throat closing as I peered inside.\n\nThere, in the middle of the field of forgotten flowers, I saw a woman. And as she turned towards me, I knew my heart was about to stop. A twinkle from the corner of her eye, and the sheen of yellowed teeth from a wide smile.\n\nPressure building. Chest cramping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up in a panic, having forced myself to fall out of bed. I crawled across the floor, only realizing that I couldn’t breathe seconds later. I couldn’t feel the tip of my fingers, and my chest was ice cold.\n\nI counted my heart beats as I fumbled my way into the bathroom. I reached for my epi-pen, accidentally knocking it down. It rolled across the floor, and under the bathtub.\n\nI fell flat on my stomach, reaching for it. It was all the way in the back.\n\nMy vision was fading as the bathroom floor felt colder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI flipped onto my back and tried to calm down. I had been without air for 65 seconds. I could make it to 90. I wouldn’t die before 90.\n\nI counted it down, staring at the ceiling.\n\n70.\n\nFrom that angle, I could’ve sworn there was a white door above. I could see the outline of the brass knocker, and the cracks of the peeling paint. I could hear the tendrils crackle on the other side, and I could feel the eyes of the woman on the other side firmly fixed on me.\n\n80.\n\nShe was right there. She was waiting.\n\n90.\n\nPlease, God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, a trickle of air; like breathing through a straw. I could feel my senses coming back to me. The pressure in my face faded, leaving me flushed and teary-eyed on the bathroom floor.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t risk it.\n\nFirst thing in the morning I called the doctor again, but they just reiterated the need to keep my epi-pen close. They booked me in for a blood test, and suggested I slept somewhere else for a day or two. It could be an allergic reaction to bed bugs, or dust mites.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking through my contact list, my thumb stopped over an old college friend; Micah.\n\nIt was at his party that I’d first met that girl in the first place. I texted him on a whim and, surprisingly, he was still around. He lived in town, and he was eager to meet up for a coffee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met Micah at a small café across the street from a local archery range. He’d gained about 80 pounds from last time I’d seen him, but his youthful spirit was as evident as ever. I held out a hand to greet him, and the guy just wrapped me up in a big hug.\n\nWe got a couple of bear claws and sat down by one of the back tables. Micah was eager to catch up. He told me all about his family and showed me plenty of pictures. His daughter who wanted to go to veterinary school. His wife who worked at the DMV. His twin boys, who were out camping.\n\n“They just love the wildlife,” he chuckled. “Ever heard of two 12-year-olds who are more interested in bird watching than video games?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter telling him about my life and my work, I tried to slip that old after-party into the conversation. The same one we’d been to all those years ago. He knew exactly what I talked about.\n\n“Man, you had it in for her,” he grinned. “Ain’t no secret.”\n\n“You know what happened to her?”\n\n“Why, you looking to make up for lost time?”\n\n“Come on, man.”\n\n“Alright, alright,” he smiled. “I’ll tell you what I know.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer name was Josie Fadden. She’d been the friend of a friend, and half the guys at the party had fallen madly in love with her; Micah included.\n\n“She got a lot of friend requests that night,” he laughed. “Don’t think she accepted any.”\n\n“You know what happened to her?”\n\n“Not sure,” he shrugged. “I think she moved to Morgantown to get her master’s.”\n\n“She still there?”\n\nMicah leaned back and grinned as he finished his bear claw.\n\n“You *are* making up for lost time, aren’t you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo an outsider, what I did next might sound insane. But I had a few days off work, and I had to stay at a hotel either way.\n\nI figured I might as well do it in Morgantown.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI drove up there over the afternoon. It was exhilarating. The only thing that could overpower my fear of the white door was the promise of seeing Josie again. It was hard to admit, but out of all the people who’d fallen in love with her that night, I had probably fallen the hardest. More than a decade later I could smell her coconut shampoo.\n\nStill, it was hard to take my mind off my burning neck rash. Covering it with an itchy scarf didn’t exactly help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped at a gas station to look her up. I couldn’t find her on any social media. I tried both ‘Josie’ and ‘Fadden’, together and separately, but I got nothing. No relatives, no friends, nothing. For all intents and purposes, she was invisible. You don’t see that often nowadays.\n\nI bought a burrito and ate it in the car. I pondered my options. You can’t just walk around Morgantown and hope you bump into the right person. That might work back in Juniper, but there had to be a better way.\n\nSitting there, I nodded off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world turned dark, and I heard a set of rusty hinges turn. Something carefully moving through the underbrush.\n\nA pale hand, reaching for me.\n\nUnblinking eyes coming out of the dark.\n\nIt was just a few minutes, but it was enough to send me reeling out of the car. I fell to the pavement, coughing violently. It was getting worse; there was blood this time.\n\nI counted down the seconds. My breath came back at 35 seconds this time. If that’s how bad it’d gotten from a five-minute nap, a full night’s sleep would be the end of me. I got a strange look from a couple of teens walking past. They slowed down to check on me, but decided it was none of their business. I couldn’t blame them.\n\nI got back in the car. I had to be careful, or I’d end up as a side-note in the local paper. ‘Sad man dead in parking lot’.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat, however, gave me an idea.\n\nThe paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, literal newspapers have been in decline for years; but Josie went to a very specific master’s program at WVU. Some of those student-run sites have been hosted on the same servers since the 90’s. Just having a quick glance at one of ‘em, I found news articles and interviews from 2014. I just had to dig further back and look for anything related to her master’s, and I might get some kind of insight.\n\nI sat there scrolling for the better part of an hour. I’m not much of a phone guy, and the thing was running hot in my sweaty palms. 2013, 2012, 2011.\n\nAnd there she was.\n\nJosie Fadden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn article weeks before her graduation in 2011. I could’ve recognized her a mile away; she had the same dimpled smile. She talked about her master’s thesis in invasive plant species, and the dangers of unchecked greenhouse gardens. \n\n“My favorite is helianthus cerulea,” the article quoted. “The blue sunflowers remind me of home.”\n\nThe article noted her working with a local florist to conduct further testing. I took note of the address and name of the owner.\n\n“But no matter how pretty it is, it must be contained,” the article concluded. “Locked away.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis lit a fire in me. I had a lead.\n\nI made a couple of calls and got a few names. The name of the florist lead to the name of the current owner. They, in turn, referred me to an ex-employee who’d worked with Josie. They, in turn, referred me to one of her old classmates. I didn’t get a number, but I got an address to a greenhouse just outside of town where they worked.\n\nIt was better than nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout an hour later, I’d made my way to the greenhouse. It was this large cylinder-shaped plastic building stretching across the parking lot. The thing was bigger than anticipated. Then again, I’d never been to one before.\n\nThey were about to close when I walked in, but I couldn’t see anyone matching the description I’d gotten. His name was Mark Burton. About my age, thick glasses, thin as a twig. Had a bit of a New England accent. I stopped to ask one of the gardeners; an older woman with a kind smile.\n\n“Mark?” she frowned. “Oh, I’m sorry to have to tell you this…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother dead end. This time literally; Mark Burton had died a few years ago.\n\nApparently, he’d asphyxiated from an allergic reaction.\n\nThe old woman sat me down to tell me all about Mark. She had a lot of fond memories of him, and his sudden death had affected her a lot. Apparently, one of her coworkers had found him.\n\n“Right down there,” she said, pointing across the greenhouse. “Back where we used to keep helianthus cerulea.”\n\n“Blue sunflowers.”\n\n“Ghastly things, aren’t they? Lovely smell though. Reminds me of coconut.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made my way back to my car and got back on my phone. Clouds had started to gather overhead, drowning the air with the smell of fresh rain.\n\nI found some of Mark’s old socials, which were still open as a sort of online tombstone. People posting pictures of him and expressing their regret. It was strange to think about; he would’ve been my age, had he still lived. And I might go the same way, if I couldn’t find the answers I needed.\n\nAnd there, a picture.\n\nMark, his sister, and Josie Fadden; tagged as Josephine Earle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new name. That was it. That was *her*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn hour later, I was parked outside a small black-bricked townhome. The last known address for Josephine Earle. The sky had gone dark with clouds, and the first spatters of rain were tapping on the window. It was hypnotic, lulling me back to sleep. The realization of which sent a shock through me, jolting me awake.\n\nI hurried up to the front door, my pulse planting a headache into the back of my cranium. I was too tired to yawn. My hands shook as I rang the doorbell.\n\nWhat was I even expecting? At that point, I didn’t know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took 20 heartbeats for her shadow to move up to the door. The handle turned, and light poured out.\n\nThe smell of coconut.\n\nAnd there she was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt felt so strange seeing her again. I couldn’t believe it. She was different, but it was still *her*. It was Josie, and in another way, it wasn’t. Then again, I was barely recognizable as well.\n\n“Can I help you?” she asked.\n\n“Josie Fadden?”\n\nShe just looked at me. It took her a few seconds to even register the name, and the implication. Finally, she shook her head.\n\n“She’s not here.”\n\n“It’s you, right?”\n\nShe sighed and looked away. After a deep breath, she met my eyes.\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n“It’s… complicated. I thought you might be able to help me.”\n\n“With what?”\n\n“The, uh… the sunflower room.”\n\nJosie, or “Josephine”, stepped back. She unlocked the door and opened it wide. It was strange to see her like this; I’d never seen her frown. Then again, I’d only known her that one night so many years ago.\n\n“Let’s talk.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe invited me in and offered me a cup of tea. We sat down in her living room, and she refused to look me in the eye. She was visibly nervous, shaking about as bad as I did.\n\n“Do you remember me?” I asked.\n\n“Sorry, no”, she said, shaking her head. “But we must’ve met.”\n\n“Yeah,” I nodded. “A few years back.”\n\n“So I told you about the sunflower room,” she sighed. “The white door, and the field where I-“\n\n“Where you plant your worries. And they turn blue.”\n\n“Those plants are native to my hometown, you know. Ever been to Tomskog, Minnesota?”\n\n“Never heard of it.”\n\n“Few have.”\n\nI sipped my tea. Fruity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I want to know what’s happening to me. I keep… thinking about that place.”\n\n“And it hurts you, doesn’t it? I think I can see a rash there.”\n\n“It does.”\n\nJosie finished her tea and put the cup down on the glass coffee table. \n\n“So why now?” I asked. “Why me?”\n\n“It needs new plants,” she shrugged. “If nothing new is planted, the room sort of… cannibalizes itself. Hell, it strains itself so much that some seeds make all the way over to our side.”\n\n“Is that why it’s hurting me? Because I haven’t… planted anything?”\n\n“Probably.”\n\n“Then why aren’t you affected?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosie got out of her chair and stretched. She turned to me with a smile; but it wasn’t the smile I remembered her by.\n\n“You have to plant something, regularly. At first, it’s things you want to get rid of. You plant your worries, your hate, your fear… but after a while you just… have to keep planting. You plant your dreams, your hopes, your loves… even your memories. You just have to keep planting, because if you don’t, the room will pull you back in.”\n\n“And if you don’t plant anything?”\n\n“Then… you,” she shrugged. “What happens to you, happens.”\n\n“So that’s all there’s to it? I have to plant things in there?”\n\n“You have to lose parts of yourself,” she clarified. “Today, it is worries, tomorrow… the rest.”\n\nShe took the empty teacup from my hands and placed it on the coffee table.\n\n“But you don’t have to plant your own things,” she smiled. “As long as you keep planting *something*.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see it now. There was a real difference to her. She had lost so much; everything down to the dimples of her smile, and the music in her voice. She was the gray remains of what’d once been Josie. Maybe that’s why she changed her name, to reflect the change she’d gone through over the years.\n\n“You… you lost it,” I said. “You lost all of it.”\n\n“So much.”\n\n“What’s even left at this point?”\n\n“Not much,” she admitted. “But what little I got, I’m gonna keep.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to get out of my chair, but my legs didn’t move. \n\nI tasted coconut, and my eyes had started moving on their own.\n\n“With you, I can plant… what, almost 40 years of hopes, dreams, and thoughts? And at the same time, tie up a loose end? I won’t have to think about that place ever again. I’ll lose nothing more.”\n\n“But you… you can’t just-“\n\nI couldn’t feel my tongue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. . .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDarkness.\n\nI felt a faint touch. Gentle hands, closing around my throat.\n\nAnd in the dark of my mind, I saw that white door with the brass knocker.\n\nIt opened itself to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thorned tendrils moved aside, welcoming me. The blue sunflowers towered above in a world full of green and blue. A full moon looking down, like a looming eye in the sky.\n\nThe pale woman was there. The one with the smile, and the unblinking eyes.\n\nAnd she turned to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept this time, I recognized her. I dared to look closer.\n\n*This*, was Josie. The sum of all her worries, dreams, hopes, and joys. Everything planted, put away, and stored. The little parts that made the whole, manifested into this sick-looking creature.\n\nShe barely had any hair left, and her physique and been stretched and twisted. Her skin had grown pale from years of darkness. She stared at me with wet, unblinking, black eyes. And when she looked at me, she did so with recognition.\n\nAnd smiled.\n\nWhat we’d had together was there, in *her*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout a word, she grasped my head with her hands. I could tell she wanted to help. She knew me. She recognized me, and she was regretful. Maybe she hadn’t meant for me to come here, to see this. Maybe she had just been a drunk girl sharing a secret.\n\nShe leaned her head against my shoulder with a gentle purr, then looked me in the eye;\n\nAnd *smashed* my head against hers, as hard as she could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t dead. This wasn’t over.\n\nBack in Josephine’s townhouse, she was leaning over me. Choking me. Suddenly, I jerked back awake, thrusting my head forward. I hit her square on the nose, sending her reeling backwards.\n\n“*Y-you…!* What the hell did you-“\n\nShe grabbed a cheese knife from an empty plate and got back up. I matched her movements to the best of my ability, but I was falling in and out of consciousness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next moment I was back there, looking at the dark eyes of she who’d once been the real Josie. The sunflowers were closing in. Thorns crept up my legs. Josie wasn’t giving up on me, but there wasn’t much she could do.\n\nFinally, she took a step back, and rushed me; throwing me forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAwake, I lunged at Josephine. She stumbled backwards, tripping on the edge of a carpet. She fell backwards, breaking her glass coffee table into a thousand pieces. Cutting herself on the pieces.\n\nThis time, as I collapsed to the floor, I knew I wouldn’t be coming back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd there we were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe three of us, the Sunflower Room. Being mauled by thorns and vivid blue petals. My skin punctured, my flesh stripped. And Josie, apologetically, tried to comfort me.\n\nWas this it? Was this all there was to it? Just… pain? Forever?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No!” cried Josephine. “I-I… I buried you!”\n\nJosie smiled at me, and I understood.\n\n“So… you don’t get away. Not even in… in death.”\n\nJosie shook her head.\n\n“You postpone it. That’s all you can do, whether you plant anything or not,” I continued. “That’s it, isn’t it?”\n\nThe thorns didn’t seem to bother her. She stroked my cheek gently as Josephine was torn to shreds.\n\n“You said this… this place used to be beautiful,” I reminisced. “Could it be?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosie whispered a secret in my ear, as Josephine’s vocal cords were stretched; and snapped. Countless beings, all twisted manifestations of memories and thoughts buried, stared at me from the dark.\n\nAll, with unblinking eyes.\n\nAnd as the blue sunflowers faded from my mind’s eye, and in the dark that remained, I asked a final question;\n\n“Will I see you again?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up on Josephine’s floor, coughing up sunflower seeds. A paramedic loomed over me, having driven an epi-pen into my leg. Apparently, the neighbors had heard the commotion.\n\nI’d killed Josephine. She lay dead on the floor.\n\nI’d planted her in the Sunflower Room.\n\nI’d postponed my death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlood tests found that there were drugs in my system. It was deemed an accidental death from self-defense. You might’ve seen it in the news, but it was just this local “domestic abuse” kind of story. A lot of context was lost, and there were bigger news circling the media that month. I’m sort of thankful for it.\n\nThe real Josie had been buried piece by piece over the years. “Josephine” was all that remained, and she was desperate not to lose herself further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, before I tell you what happened next, I want you to think about this with me. Really think about it.\n\nImagine the white door. An old, white, wooden door. A brass knocker that’s been turning green over the years. The door is segmented into two squares, stacked on top of one another. Try to imagine it. You’ve probably seen something like it before.\n\nAnd as it opens, it gives way to a field of flowers. Beautiful blue sunflowers, in neat rows. There, you can bury your worries, your hatred, your ugly thoughts; and the caretakers of that room will care for them, forever. Imagine the fresh soil between your fingers, and pushing something awful down into it.\n\nDoesn’t sound too bad, does it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here’s the thing.\n\nI’m *sorry*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy telling you about the Sunflower Room, you become aware. It’s a mark that you can’t get rid of. It is this fixed idea that will settle and grow. It can change things. Plant things. Take things. We can all mitigate it by just planting that one thing every now and then. If we all pitch in, collectively, I think the effect will be milder.\n\nMaybe that place is something we’ve always had. A heaven or hell, depending on how you see it. Maybe it was there all along, in the back of our collective minds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe it can be beautiful.\n\nJosie told me so.",

        "text": "I used to run a blog for dog sitters in Denver and I was scrolling through old posts and found this crazy post from a sitter a few years ago. I thought you guys might like it over here:\n\nJanuary 19:\n\nHi DogSittersofDenver! My name is Abby, and i’m a dog sitter. I’ve never posted here before, but I was hoping to get some advice for a dog i’m watching. Her name is Sadie, and she’s a supermutt, some sort of pitt bull/chihuahua mix by the looks of it but i’m not really sure. Her owner, Eleanor, went to the Bahamas and hired me to watch Sadie in my apartment. I live in downtown Denver, just below Cap Hill.\n\nSadie is pretty cute and well behaved, though she’s reactive to other dogs and some people on walks. Overall though, she’s sweet and she sleeps a lot when we’re home which is really nice.\n\nThe first few days were pretty easy. She gets a little restless at night, but usually settles down. I hung out with her at home while I worked, and then took her across the street to the churchyard to play ball every day. There’s no fence, but I let her off leash and she generally knows to stay on the grass. On the 4th day though, we were playing in the yard and a man came out of the door to the church. Sadie went nuts, running up to him and growling and barking. I was really embarrassed, and got her back on a leash and apologized to the man. He was older, probably in his mid to late 60s with a long beard, which maybe freaked her out. I’ve never seen him before, but the church is sort of a center for homeless people, so people are always in and out. I felt super bad, and apologized again. He didn’t say anything, just kind of glanced at me and shuffled away. I brought Sadie back home, still embarrassed, and decided she couldn’t handle being off leash at the church anymore.\n\nThe next day, I brought her instead to the fenced-in area of the apartment complex to play ball. I didn’t want to do that initially because I didn’t want to disturb the other apartment residents, but I figured it’s just for one day until it was the weekend and I could take Sadie out for a long hike or run to get her energy out. Everything was going well, and she played and even greeted a few residents. Until an older woman who lives in the complex came out to get to the back gate. I’ve seen this woman around and we generally nod to each other, but i’ve never really talked to her. Sadie went absolutely nuts. She ran up to the woman barking, snarling, not lunging but definitely not nice. I apologized profusely, leashed her up, and took her upstairs.\n\nI obviously won’t take her out anymore and let her off leash because I can’t be sure who she’s going to react to, and I don’t trust her at a dog park. Does anyone on here have any advice on where to exercise reactive dogs off leash in the city? I would really appreciate it!\n\nUpdate: (January 27)\n\nI didn’t get many replies to my first post, fair enough, but I wanted to update because something else started happening. 2 nights ago, so the 6th night of dog sitting, Sadie started doing this weird thing at night. She’d pass out on the couch like usual, and follow me to bed when I went. In the middle of the night though, I woke up with kind of a creepy feeling. It was dark of course, and when I opened my eyes and they adjusted, I could see Sadie standing right next to the bed, staring at me. She was completely still, tail up and stiff, just staring. I was a little unsettled, and just looked back for a bit. She’s not big, only about 20 pounds, but she has the blocky pit bull head and looks pretty intimidating. Eventually I reached out my hand, and she sniffed it for a moment before wagging her tail and jumping back on the bed. She fell asleep, and as far as I know that was that.\n\nLast night though, it happened again. I woke up around 3am with that creepy feeling again, and looked around for Sadie. She was standing next to the bed, staring at me and growling softly. I can’t really explain it, but she was completely still. You could see the tension coming off of her. I was sleepy and kind of fed up so I told her to snap out of it and go to bed. I rolled over, a little uneasy but I guess I fell asleep again. When I woke up, she was asleep on the bed next to me and acting totally normal.\n\nHas anyone experienced this before? She seems to like me, but she goes weird at night. Is this a safety issue for me?\n\nUpdate: (January 28)\n\nThank you everyone for your replies! I took the advice of a few of you and last night I left the hallway light on as a nightlight, and left out a few chew toys for Sadie in case she was getting restless. I also had a pet cam from my cat who passed away and set it up, as one of you suggested, to see if anything was happening that set her off. Unfortunately, around 3am again, I woke up and looked over at Sadie. It was really unsettling. The hallway light lit her up and I could see her standing completely still. Her eyes were wide and kind of insane looking, and her teeth were bared. She was standing off to the side of the bed, just staring at me. With the light on, this time I could see that she was shaking a little bit. Freaked out, I got up and went to the kitchen to grab some water and just calm down a little, and she stayed in the room like that. After about 30 minutes, she walked over to me in the living room acting normal. I pet her, and we went back to bed, where she curled up and we fell asleep.\n\nI rewatched the footage from the pet cam in the morning and didn’t see too much. There were some shadows from outside moving on the walls, which I assume were cars passing, and that’s when Sadie got out of bed. She disappeared from the camera view for a bit, then when she came back in she was freaking out. Then nothing happened until I woke up and went to the kitchen. While I was in the kitchen, she was still standing there, totally still with her teeth bared (i'm assuming, her face was pointing away from me). The camera did at least show me that when I thought she was staring at me, she was actually staring at the little door. I have a door sort of behind my bed, almost a utility closet thing, that opens to the outside and leads to what used to be a fire escape. But it’s locked and bolted, I don’t even have a key to it, so i’m not sure why it was triggering her. Needless to say, i’m now also creeped out by the door.\n\nHas anyone ever had a dog do this?? I could really use some advice. I don’t know, it’s pretty weird, but i’m kind of over it. I’m freaked out and not getting much sleep, but I guess i’ll just wait out the 3 days until Eleanor comes back. I'm definitely not going to dog sit her again.\n\nUpdate: (January 29)\n\nThings are not ok. I jolted awake last night because Sadie was going ape shit. Snarling, howling, snapping at the air next to my face just off the bed. I almost punched her in the face just out of adrenaline. I tried to calm her down but she just kept barking and snarling. She probably woke every neighbor up. I was scared and just overwhelmed, so I grabbed her and took her out of the bedroom and shut the door and took her to the living room. She calmed down almost immediately, it was so weird. I looked at the live feed of the camera, looking at the fire escape door. I thought I was going crazy, because nothing was there. About an hour later, I even went into the room and checked the door. It was still locked of course. Sadie and I slept on the couch, and I plan to sleep there again tonight. I know i’m just speaking to the void now, but I’m so ready for this dog sitting to be over with.\n\nFinal Update: (February 12)\n\nI really feel like I need to share this with you all. Sadie was a fake name. The name of the dog that might have saved my life is Mitzi. After I dropped her off with her owner, I went back home happy to go back to normal. As it got darker though, I started getting creeped out thinking about her growling, and the fire escape door, and everything. So for peace of mind, I switched on the pet cam, took an edible and got super stoned, and fell asleep. I usually need weed to help me sleep through the night, but I don’t take it when i’m dog sitting in case an emergency happens and I have to drive to the vet or something.\n\nI woke up the next morning feeling better. I checked out the pet cam, fast forwarding until 3am rolled around and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It felt like my heart jumped through my throat. The fire escape door opened. While I was fast asleep, it opened and someone squeezed through. I couldn’t see him too well since it was dark, but I recognized the wool hat and beard as the guy that Mitzi growled at in the churchyard almost a week earlier. He just stood over me, staring, and at one point he reached out and touched my hair. I moved a little but didn’t wake up. He stayed until 5:15.\n\nI had a full blown panic attack watching the tape. Hyperventilating, nausea, all of it. My hands were shaking so hard that it was difficult to hold onto my phone while I dialed the police. They came, and I showed them the video. It was the worst moment of my life. They were able to find the man, a homeless guy who volunteered at the church in exchange for a place to sleep. My apartment building used to belong to the church, and he somehow had the keys to everyone’s old fire escape doors. I don’t know how long he had been coming into my room to watch me sleep, but judging by the story the police got out of him, it sounds like it was at least a month or two. In his bunk they found some things that he had taken from my room, including a hair brush, 2 pairs of underwear, and an old journal that I had thought I lost. The underwear was crusted in something that I just don't want to think about. I feel so completely violated and terrified.\n\nIf it weren’t for Mitzi, I wouldn’t have installed that pet cam and i’m not sure how much longer this would have gone on, or how far that man would have taken it. The locks to everyone’s old fire escapes are all being changed, and i’m definitely not getting high before bed anymore, but i’m probably going to move. I just don’t feel safe here anymore, even with the old man gone. Every time I see that older woman in my complex, the other person that Mitzi growled at, I can’t help but wonder what she’s up to. Even with the utility locks changed, who knows who has copies of the keys?\n\nAll that said, I visit Mitzi every few days with a treat and I found good spots to play ball in the city. I will happily dog sit her again.\n\n(End of blog updates)",

        "text": "I don't know where to start with this. Even thinking about it makes me feel uneasy, like I'm inviting something dark and sinister into my life just by talking about it. But I have to share my story, because I can't keep this to myself any longer. It all started with a vintage vinyl player, a beautiful piece of machinery that I thought would bring me nothing but joy and nostalgia. Little did I know that it would lead me down a path of fear and terror. This is the story of how I encountered the unknown, and how I barely escaped with my sanity intact.\n\nI've always been a collector of vintage electronics, and one of my prized possessions was a classic vinyl player. It was a beautiful piece of machinery, with intricate brass details and a rich, warm sound that was like nothing I'd ever heard from a modern device. I was a big fan of classic rock and metal music, and I loved playing my old Black Sabbath and The Doors records on it. The deep, haunting sound of those bands was perfect for the vintage feel of the vinyl player.\n\nI had found the vinyl player at an old antique shop, tucked away in the corner of the store. The shopkeeper told me that it had belonged to an old music collector who had passed away many years before, and that it had been sitting in the store collecting dust ever since. Despite its age and obvious signs of wear, I was drawn to the machine and I knew I had to have it.\n\nI brought the vinyl player home and set it up in my living room, eager to start listening to my records on it. At first, everything seemed perfect. The sound was crisp and clear, and I felt like I was transported back in time every time I played a record. But then, one day, as I was playing a particularly creepy old record, I started to notice something strange. The music was becoming more and more distorted, and I could hear whispers and voices that seemed to be coming from the machine itself. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but as the whispers grew louder, I realized that this was no ordinary vinyl player.\n\nI tried to turn off the machine, but the power button wouldn't respond. The voices grew more intense, and I could feel a cold, malevolent presence in the room. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or even scream. I felt as though I was being watched, as though something was reaching out to me from beyond the grave.\n\nI tried to pull the needle off the record, but it wouldn't budge. The music was becoming more and more distorted, and the whispers grew louder and more sinister. I could feel the cold presence getting closer, and I was sure that I was going to die. And then, suddenly, the room went silent. The vinyl player had stopped on its own, the needle stuck in the grooves of the record. I didn't know what to do, but I was too scared to stay in the room any longer. I gathered my courage and fled the room, leaving the vinyl player behind.\n\nI locked the door to the room and tried to forget about what had just happened. But the memory of the whispers and the distorted music stayed with me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.\n\nDays passed, and I started to hear the whispers and the distorted music again, even when I was nowhere near the room where I had left the vinyl player. I was sure that I was going insane, and I didn't know what to do.\n\nThat's when I remembered the shopkeeper who had sold me the vinyl player. I decided to pay him a visit, to see if he could shed any light on what was happening to me.\n\nWhen I arrived at the antique shop, the shopkeeper was nowhere to be found. But I did find an old diary, hidden away in a drawer. As I read through the pages, I learned that the previous owner of the vinyl player had been a music collector who had dabbled in the dark arts. He had used the vinyl player to channel spirits from beyond the grave, and he had written in his diary about how the machine had become possessed by an evil entity.\n\nI realized then that the vinyl player was not just a machine, but a gateway to the other side. And I was afraid that the entity that had possessed the machine was now after me. I couldn't keep living in fear, so I made the difficult decision to destroy the vinyl player. I took it to a remote location and burned it to ashes, hoping that it would break the connection between me and the entity.\n\nTo this day, I still have nightmares about that fateful day when I played my old Black Sabbath and The Doors records on the vinyl player. I can still hear the whispers and the distorted music in my head, and I'm always looking over my shoulder, afraid that the entity will come for me again. I learned the hard way that some things are better left in the past, and that some vintage electronics are not just machines, but gateways to the unknown.",

I’m not sure why I didn’t do it sooner, but I felt better knowing it was getting picked up with our trash that day. I also resolved to talk to my mom and dad. Even if I sounded crazy, I know they’d help me wade through whatever was happening. I almost threw out Rohan’s business card too, but something stopped me. For now, it stayed folded in my back pocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I biked home after school I felt better than I had in months. I had a plan. My mom and dad were busy, but good people. I’d tell them what happened, and we’d figure this out. My stomach jumped a bit as I turned on to my street and saw Rick Marshall’s SUV in Mr. B’s driveway. The garage door was open and I knew they’d see me as I passed by to my house. I took a deep breath and kept pedaling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t get very far. Mr. B practically sprinted down his driveway when he saw me and I stopped reluctantly. One look at his flushed face and the way Mr. Marshall was leaning in the garage told me they’d been drinking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Dylan! I’m glad I caught you son” He grabbed my shoulder again, but this time in a kind way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Everything OK sir?” I asked, working hard to make myself smaller in his grip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m sure you’ve heard about Stu by now,” he began, and continued talking excitedly over my nod, “Well, as you’re aware, I am very close with Sheriff Davidson. Now this is all very hush hush son, you hear? He told me that Stu’s death isn’t being treated as an accidental death. No sir, they have these muddy footprints they found leading away from the pool-” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything after that faded out. *Muddy footprints?* I felt goosebumps break out up my arm as I thought about the footprints leading from my room to the top of the staircase in my house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Are you listening boy?” cut in Mr. Marshall, who’d staggered down beside Mr. B and I snapped back to attention. Something was off about both of them, and it wasn’t just the beer. Their eyes had this *intensity* and Mr. Marshall couldn’t seem to sit still. He paced back and forth behind Mr. B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Y-yessir, I’m sorry. I just can’t believe someone would hurt Mr. Corbett” I stammered out, letting all the fear I was feeling into my voice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B shot Mr. Marshall a look and he backed off. “Now listen son, you’re safe” Mr. B declared, squeezing my shoulder again. “You just need to let me know about anything strange that happens around here. Like that man who came by, he give you anything? Tell you how to get ahold of him?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No sir” I lied, thinking about the card in my pocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. B stared at me for a moment and said, “Alright son, give me your number, I’ll text you so you have a way to get in touch with me in case anything happens.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWanting to get away, I rattled off my number as quickly as I could. Mr. B typed something into his phone and only let me go when we both heard a message ding. He nodded to me and I wheeled my bike back down to the road, careful not to step on his grass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI checked the message as I walked up my driveway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Remember son, I’m always next door.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put my bike away and walked up to the front door. My heart began to pound. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This isn’t real*. I told myself. But it was. The package was back, with muddy footprints leading down the front steps away from it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kicked the package out of the way and ran inside, locking the door behind me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran into the kitchen calling for my dad, but stopped as I glanced at the calendar. My brain did a million forbidden curses as I remembered mom and dad  were both out of town tonight. Even if I called them to come home right now, they were at least an hour and a half away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy blood froze as a pounding came from the front door. Heart hammering, I slowly walked back down the hallway toward my front door. I jumped as the pounding came again, louder this time. I reached for the door handle and let out a scream as it flew open. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy little sister Emma burst in the front door and shot me a look. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why’d you lock the door, weirdo? I was right behind you. Didn’t you hear me call you?” She chided me as she pushed past into the house. My heart was still pounding in my ears as I sank against the wall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You scared the shit out of me.” I managed to get out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You could have brought in Mom’s package.” she replied and I realized with horror that she held the charred package in her hands. “I wonder what happened to it? It looks like they set it on fire.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Super weird, I thought it was a prank or something I guess,” I tried (and failed) to sound normal. “Just leave it in her office so she can find it.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmma narrowed her eyes at me, but shrugged and headed down the hallway. I ran upstairs to my room, and looked out my window. I could still see Mr. Marshall’s truck in Mr. B’s driveway. I wondered if they had seen someone deliver the package. Maybe that’s why they were acting so weird. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sank onto my bed and muffled a sob. I just wanted to hide in my room and be done with all of this. It seemed like every time I tried to avoid trouble, it just seemed to find me. As I thought about my problems my hand slipped into my pocket and I realized I was holding Rohan’s card again like a talisman. An idea took hold and I opened up my phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn hour later I was shivering in a nearby park with the package in my backpack. Rohan had agreed to meet me away from my house. It took $20 and a promise of a week’s worth of chores to get Emma to agree to not tell Mom and Dad I went out when I was supposed to be watching her. I made sure she locked up after me and snuck through the backyard to avoid Mr. B and Mr. Marshall out front. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor all my precautions, my gut was still rolling as I saw Rohan pull up in a small sedan. He got out and sat next to me on the bench, remarking on what a beautiful day it was. Not willing to make small talk, I pulled the package out of my backpack and sat it on the bench between us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had thought long and hard about what I was going to say. I had it rehearsed, but when the moment came, it all left my head. All I managed to say woodenly was, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This keeps getting delivered.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe paused for a moment. We sat silently on the bench for a moment. When I looked up he was looking at me with kind, sad eyes. All he said softly was “Ah.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“D’you think--” I started. Then paused for a moment, not knowing the right words. Rohan waited patiently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Do you think this has something to do with that delivery driver?” I asked timidly, I felt myself fold in when I saw Rohan’s eyes turn penetrating again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It would seem odd, considering you knew nothing about Rajat.” He responded mildly. I felt my leg start to bounce up and down, and ground into it with my elbow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Right! No, I mean--” I hated how he stayed silent while I stammered on. I was beginning to regret calling him. I felt my face flush as I stared at the blurring ground in front of me. That familiar voice in my head started up again.  *I’m so pathetic. I just need to go. I can’t help anyway, I’m useless --*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA hand touched my shoulder and the voice slipped away. The sob I’d been holding on to burst out of my chest and I lost it for a moment on that bench while he waited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Dylan,” he began gently. “I’m not sure what you’re holding on to, however I promise you the only way that you’ll be able to get rid of the feelings that are plaguing you is to talk about it. Tell me what happened. What happened to Rajat?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sniffled and nodded, trying to catch my breath. I took a breath and prepared myself to tell him everything, when a ding broke my train of thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“One second sir, this might be my sister” I muttered and pulled my phone out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I read the message I felt the blood drain from my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Dylan, what’s wrong?” Rohan sounded alarmed as I swayed on the bench.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI showed him my phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Say hi to your friend for us son. Tell him you’re both to meet us at Blackwater Pond within the hour. I’d hate to make us wait any longer with this pretty little thing.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeneath the text was a picture of Emma, trussed up and looking terrified in the back of Mr. B’s truck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[X.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingsOfEvelynReece/)",

        "text": "My husband, August, and I, Kai, live on the second story of a large apartment complex. The buildings are tightly packed and close together. Our walls are thin enough that we can hear people going up and down the metal stairs.\n\nAnother note about our buildings, the windows are a bit odd. In the apartments themselves, the windows don't quite seal properly. During big snowstorms I always find snow on the windowsills. In the hallways and stairways, there are holes for windows, but no glass in them. Wind goes freely through our building which can sometimes produce a really haunting howling sound.\n\nLast night, we were laying in bed, just talking and chatting. I made a dumb joke and he acted offended, got out of bed and left to go to the kitchen. I was laughing the whole time because he was just being goofy. I heard him rummaging in the kitchen and presumed he was grabbing a snack while he was up, so I went onto my phone to watch some tiktoks.\n\nWhen he came back, he was kind of chuckling.\n\n\"I didn't know you could whistle,\" he said.\n\nI looked at him confused. \"I didn't whistle.\"\n\nI've never been able to whistle. Not once in my whole life. I can imitate the sound decently enough to get my dog's attention, but it's never been a skill of mine. I also recently got my lips pierced, so even if I could, I wouldn't be whistling right now.\n\nHis face went as white as a sheet. \"I heard someone whistling. I thought it was you.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It's probably just the wind. It can be eerie sometimes.\"\n\nHe nodded his head, though I could tell his hands were shaking. \"You're right. Yeah.\"\n\nHe left the room and I heard him turning on the sink a couple of times and chugging glasses of water. When he returned, he just stood in the doorway looking annoyed.\n\n\"I know it's you. Please stop,\" he said firmly.\n\n\"It's really not me. I promise. Like I said, it's just the wind.\"\n\n\"Did you hear it?\"\n\n\"I heard the wind. There's no whistling.\"\n\nI stared at him, trying to get him to understand that it's nothing paranormal or odd. He finally relented. He entered our bedroom, closed and locked the door behind him and got back into bed. He never locks the door to our room. We never lock the door. We simply have no need to. The front door is locked and the windows are locked so there's no need to lock the bedroom.\n\nI gave him a sideways glance before returning my attention to my phone. He just sat uneasily and stared at the wall. After a couple of minutes, it began to freak me out, so I suggested we go to bed. It was nearing midnight anyways. He agreed. So we began our nighttime routine. Skincare, teeth brushing, plug in devices, etc etc.\n\nThen I heard it. I was climbing into bed while he brushed his teeth when I heard it. A high pitch first, then a low pitch. It was distinct and human. Something told me to open the blinds and check, but I resisted, instead, I crawled into bed and pulled the blankets tight around me.\n\nAugust joined me a bit later, after turning off the lights. I stayed still in bed. I usually gave him a kiss before bed, but something about the blinds, the outdoors, and the storm outside gave me pause. I didn't want to turn to look at the blinds.\n\n\"Kai, aren't you forgetting something?\" He teased. All the tension was gone out of his voice. It was like he had forgotten about the whistling already.\n\n\"You'll have to come over here if you want something,\" I said back.\n\nHe laughed and leaned dramatically over me to kiss me. I leaned into it, enjoying his warmth. But when I opened my eyes to pull away, I saw it.\n\nIt looked like a child, fingers curled around the top edge of our window and toes just barely able to touch the windowsill. It was silhouetted in the blinds, it's shadow only visible by the streetlight outside. It whistled. High, then low. The wind howled, rattling the building.\n\nI screamed and frantically reached for my phone. I flipped on the flashlight and shined it directly on the window. The shadow was gone. August looked at me wearily.\n\n\"You saw what's whistling?\" He asked.\n\nI nodded, still pointing my flashlight at the window. \"Please turn the lights on. Now please.\"\n\nAugust hopped up from the bed and flipped the light switch. It took it's time turning on. One old light bulb flickered on. I glanced up at the ceiling in the dim light, watching the shadows stretch out around it... almost in the shape of a person. I swallowed hard. The second bulb flickered on, destroying the shadows.\n\nI turned off my flashlight and sat upright in bed. August joined me, putting an arm around my shoulder and pulling me tight.\n\n\"I don't want to know what it is. Don't tell me, but I don't think we can sleep tonight,\" he said.\n\nI couldn't agree more. It's now three in the morning and the whistling won't stop. My dog is sleeping right underneath the window, which he never does. I think I need to open the window and see what it is. Maybe it's just cold.",

        "text": "My mom was dying from cancer. It was quick and severe. Stage four, by the time they caught it. In a matter of months, she went from healthy to bedridden, so weak she couldn’t even take care of herself. \n\nI had just graduated high school and had been planning to go to college that fall. I’d made plans to do a big road trip with my friends that summer, one last hurrah before we all went our separate ways. \n\nThen suddenly none of that was important anymore. My mom needed me, so I dropped everything and took care of her. \n\nBut it wasn’t enough.\n\nShe kept getting worse, no matter what I did.\n\nThat’s when I began to pray. I’d never been particularly religious, but I was desperate. My mom was my only family. My dad had been out of the picture my whole life, and I had no siblings. No living grandparents. No cousins or aunts or uncles. Just me and her, our whole lives. \n\nAnd I wasn’t ready to be alone. \n\nSo I prayed and prayed, just like you see on TV. I prayed morning, day, and night, pleading for God to heal her. I promised lifelong devotion. I promised anything I could think of, but none of it helped. \n\nShe kept getting worse until it was only a matter of days. \n\nSo I prayed some more, this time opening it up to whatever god would take me.\n\nWhat I didn’t realize was more than just deity was listening. \n\nThe next morning, I went into my mom’s room to get her ready for the day, but she wasn’t in her bed. I stood there frozen, not knowing what to do. She hadn’t left that bed in weeks. \n\nThat’s when I heard the singing. It was coming from her bathroom. The shower was running, and she was singing. \n\nThe water stopped, and a few minutes later she opened the door and came out, wrapped in a bright white towel. Her sallow skin was now bright and healthy. \n\n“Morning,” she said with a smile, drying her dark hair with another towel. “I’m feeling so good today!” She said it as if she hadn’t just been dying of cancer less than 24 hours ago. \n\nBut I didn’t question it. Neither of us did. She was better, and that was miracle enough. I knew not to look a gift horse in the mouth. \n\nWe spent the whole day together. We ate ice cream, went on walks, enjoyed the warm summer day. \n\nThe other shoe didn’t drop until that night. \n\nMy mom was asleep, but I laid awake in bed. Nothing made sense. The day had been amazing, but surely it wasn’t sustainable. Surely we needed to take her to the doctor to be examined. \n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of something scraping against the inside of my closet door.\n\nMy room was dark, only the light from the dim street lamp trickling in. The wind blew outside, the shadows of the rustling branches playing across my door and walls. \n\nI sat up, cocking my head to the side to listen. Then I heard it again, something sharp dragging along the closet door. \n\nSlowly, I stood up and walked to the closet. I placed my ear to the door, my breath stuck in my lungs. This time, the sound of a million tiny bugs scurrying across the wood reached my ears. \n\nI threw the door open, ready to confront whatever was on the other side.\n\nBut there was nothing. Just my clothes. \n\nI turned back to my bed, and that’s when I saw it. \n\nThe shape of a body laid under my covers, like a cadaver in the morgue. \n\nThe white sheet rested thin across the body, the points of the head and toes still visible. \n\nI crept toward the bed, my heart thundering in my chest, blood rushing to my ears. The floorboards creaked underneath me, the wood cool on my bare feet. \n\nReaching toward the sheet, I pulled it off in one swift tug. A scream surfaced to my throat, threatening to burst out, but it stayed trapped in my mouth. \n\nThere, in my bed, was the corpse of my mother. \n\nHer skin was gray and flaky, peeling off in chunks and strips. Her mouth was open in a scream, her cheeks mottled and sunken. She looked like a statue with chips of paint gouged out. Her eyes were black pits, as if birds had plucked out the soft meat that had once been there. \n\nBile rose to my throat and I clasped a hand over my mouth. This couldn’t be my mother, not the healthy women I’d just spent the day with. \n\nI stepped back away from the body, and that’s when it moved. \n\nIts head turned violently to the side, the sound of bones snapping filling the air. I could tell, even without eyes, that it was staring right at me. Looking into my very soul. \n\nI scrambled backwards as the body lifted upright, now standing on my bed and peering down at me. It cocked its head again, this time so far it was perpendicular with its shoulders. \n\nA faint rattling noise escaped its black mouth as it hunched forward to get a better look at me. \n\nThen, it began to transform. \n\nThe ratty black hair shifted, the broken skin of her face warping. It pulled back, turning into smooth, gray bone as her hair twisted upward into jagged antlers. In a matter of seconds, whatever this thing was now wore the mask of some kind of wild animal, all sharp teeth and glistening bone. \n\nRed dots burned in its eyes, and the rest of its body transformed, changing from my mother’s corpse to a gnarled mass of roots, leaves, and branches. Its body seemed as if it was made from the forest floor itself, dark and earthy.\n\nThe monster that stood before me descended off the bed, never breaking eye contact. \n\nThe smell of rotting wood and damp earth rolled over me, ancient and buried. \n\nIt moved closer, but I stayed frozen, my back pressed against the wall. \n\nIt cocked its head once more, the skull now upside down, then it emitted the rattling noise and its head shifted back, right side up. \n\nIts earthy body rippled, and a bony hand emerged, black nails sharp as talons. It reached forward, and I closed my eyes as it caressed the side of my face. Its fingers were cold as death, rough as sandpaper. \n\nIt clicked again, and although it didn’t speak, I could somehow understand it. \n\nYour mother. I have returned her to you. \n\nIt pulled back its hand, and I looked at it once more. It was now crouched forward, its face only inches from mine.  \n\n\\*I heard your prayer and answered. Now, you must make payment.\\*\n\nI remained speechless. I didn’t know what to say. The bony hand reached out once more. This time, it took my hand, running the dark nail against my palm. \n\nThen, quick as lightning, it jabbed its nail into my hand, stabbing through the flesh. Blood welled up, and I tried to pull my hand back, but its grip was tight, a vice. \n\nIt continued to dig into my hand until I was certain it would break all the way through to the other side. A whimper trembled on my lips, then the room around me vanished. \n\nSuddenly, I was floating above a street I didn’t recognize, the night pressing in around me. \n\nI sputtered and gasped, struggling to return to the ground, but I remained there, trapped in suspension. \n\nFrom my left, I heard a sound and whipped around. \n\nAn old man, wearing a tattered bathrobe and worn slippers, guided a faded and dented garbage can to the curb. Its wheels rumbled over the uneven driveway, and I called out for him to help, but he couldn’t hear me. \n\nHe just continued pushing the garbage can, his head tilted down, his back stooped in an aged hunch.\n\nI opened my mouth to speak again, but a sudden jolt of pain ripped through my skull. The clicking noise filled my brain once more. \n\n\\*This man,\\* it said, \\*made a deal with me. I saved his life when no one else would. But when I came to collect payment, he refused. You will get me what’s mine.\\*\n\nThe pain flared, and I squeezed my eyes shut in pure agony. When I opened them again, I was back in my room. Not just in my room, but under my covers. In my bed. \n\nAs if the whole thing had been a dream. \n\nExcept I knew it wasn’t.\n\nGripped in my hand, I felt something hard and bony. I pulled back the covers to see a dagger, cold and sharp, clutched in my hand. The handle was made of the same bone as the demon’s face. The blade was twisted metal, dark and somber.\n\nI let go, pushing it off the bed, and the sudden headache returned. Images flashed across my mind. My mom, dead and rotting. Me, covered in blood, my throat slit. The demon, standing over me until its body consumed my own. \n\nI let out a deep breath of air as the visions ended, the pain receding. \n\nI looked back at my hand to see the dagger there once more. \n\nFrom the closet, a darkness seemed to emanate. The clicking resumed, fainter this time, and two red dots burned from the shadows. \n\n\\*Find him,\\* it whispered to me. \n\nAnd then it gave me the man’s name. \n\nAs if in response, the blade suddenly burned hot in my hand, hungry for blood. \n\nI stood up from the bed. \n\nThe demon had made its demand clear, and I would make certain I had paid my debt.",

        "text": "Me and my friend got bored one day around 11 at night but we remembered something we could go do there was a abandoned house it must have been. Abandoned no longer then 40 to 50 years we got In after a long walk that lasted 20 minutes to get there when we seem the house. It looked really beaten up plants was over grown all over the house the red paint was almost nonexistent the wood on the door. And the house was chipped and Rowlett it looked like it was going to fall at anymoment but being dumb bored teenagers we still went into. The house first thing I felt there was something or someone was watching us and then the smell of the inside of this house hit us. It smelled like rotting food and must have been like the people who lived here didn't take anything but a few things with them before they left in a hurry the. Shoes jackets hoodies just left a few feet a away from the door and the fridge and the furniture was left and the house made creaking noises almost ever step into the kitchen and the hallway into the living room. The house looked a lot better in side then the outside wasn't as broken down we started to wonder why this place was. Abandoned than there was a sound up stairs. Sound it like something fall we looked at each other then he started walking out to the hallway then I started to follow him all the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the stairs and walked up the stairs hearing every crack and creek all the way up the stairs. It looked nowhere near as good as it did downstairs there was 2 hallways and 6 doors and we went down the hallway in front of us we went in each door we split off to one side each of the hallway. To make the looking around faster there were 4. Room 1. Bedroom 1. Bathroom 1. Spare room and 1. Master bedroom.  They looked like the hallway but just with more stuff in them but than we heard something that. Stock me to my very core it was a deep dark laugher from the hallway we didn't go down yet we went by the stairs and seem the thing that made this laugh it had red eyes. And a black figure but it didn't look transparent like a black mist it disappeared around the door way for some reason we didn't leave then and there we just had to go see. What it was we went into the room there was nobody in there no way out but the door then we heard the laugh in the hallway I seem only. For a moment before it went down stairs we wanted going to leave right then and there but it was at the. Bottom of the stairs and all I felt was a deep hatred then the laugh and it was gone just like that we didn't wanna stay there for any longer. We starting to run down the stairs out the door into town we both went home after and talked. About what happened the next day but it didn't stop there for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dreams the laughs the sounds the whispers the dreams didn't stop until my friend went back to the house when I seem him the next day he looked like a shell of himself but he wouldn't tell me what. Happened to him but after that was the last day anyone.  Had seem of him but I know he's in that house and I will get him out of there but I know that red eyed thing is not the only thing in that place.",

        "text": "-What?\n“That’s what we should call her, Zalora”\n-Why?\n“See it? She has a mark on her shirt, it looks somewhat like the letters Z-A-L-O-R-A”\n-No, I mean why do we need to treat that thing like a human, giving it a name and a gender?\n\nThat’s the conversation I had with a member of my team 2 months ago. See a computer and the human brain basically function the same, both are made of “wires”, that either have electricity or not, 0 or 1. Our science team isn’t public, we try to find out about how artificial intelligence learns so we can apply that knowledge to the human brain. Our team is one of many in our facility, we have one for text, one for sound, and our is for images.\n\nI will not list any names, nor will I talk with a lot of detail or mention my part, I admit, I am scared, that’s why I only use “we”.\n\nWe are trying to find out how brains see and remember images. We give our AI’s images and text, ordering them to make new ones, seeing what patterns are remembered. We have volunteers, we scan their brain waves to observe how they see and remember patterns in images, and how they respond to the images made by our AI’s. Of course, they can’t say anything to the public, we have them under contract. The volunteers are living in a section of our facility, most of them are poor, they don’t care if we put rods in their head as long as they have a house and a warm meal.\n\nOne day we were giving our most develop AI random text prompts. A team member gave it a prompt, “Perfection”. It surprised most our team; it showed an image of a disgusting feminine-like creature. It was pale with mostly black eyes, the facial proportions abhorrent, it had skinny arms with fingers much longer than the palms, the teeth looked like yellow piano keys with giant gaps between them.\n\nIt was like a car crash; it’s horrible but you can’t look away from it. Most people would consider that a failure, that’s why only a few people get accepted into this job. We were combining other images with it, the patterns of her face and arms remained. Sometimes new parts would appear, like clothes or legs but they wouldn’t be remembered in the long term. That’s how we gave her the name “Zalora”.\n\nWe tested volunteers with the images, all of them remembered it, everyone remembered every detail, from people with picture perfect memory to people with aphantasia. \n\nThat night I went to sleep and I swear every time I closed my eyes I saw “Zalora’s” silhouette. Sorry, I shouldn’t mention myself, I am a 3rd party, an observer, a beholder.\n\n“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”\n\nWhen you buy groceries, it’s like you can’t leave the shop without buying another item. It’s designed that way, a sort of flow for you to follow because you enjoy it, the music, the sales, the lay-out.  The “flow”, that’s what we call it. See our AI managed to make images with the perfect “flow”, for the human brain. Her face and hands followed symmetry and the golden spiral, things our brain enjoyed. \n\nIn short “Zalora”, is that perfect “flow”.\n\nIt’s ironic, our human brains cannot comprehend how beautiful and perfect “Zalora”, is so we see her as a disgusting monster, but we remember her so clearly because she’s so beautiful.\n\nWe gave the images to the other teams. They transformed the “flow”, or “Zalora”, from the images into a song and a book. We call them “Zalora’s Requiem”, and “Book of Zalora”. Every member of every team is obsessed with those, even the volunteers. But it’s still disgusting to us. \n\nThe reason I am posting this is because around 10 minutes ago an anonymous individual managed to get a hold of the images, song and book. They posted it on all social media’s and the dark net. I don’t blame them, it was inevitable. \n\nUpdate:\n\nIn just 2 weeks it spread like wild fire. “Zalora’s Requiem”, is the most listened to song of all time, it broke that record in just a week. “Book of Zalora”, has sold more copies than the bible. People are crying, screaming and vomiting everywhere, the book, song and images are so disgusting but they can’t stop observing them. After the first 3 days celebrities began to do cosmetic surgeries to look more like “Zalora”, 6 days in it was the most popular free surgery, available for all.\n\nFuck it, I can’t stand this anonymity anymore. My name is Jensen Adam, no one cares about anything anymore, “Zalora”, is the only thing that matters anymore. Our team is now trying to make lower beings comprehend “Zalora”, or the “flow”, whatever you want to call it, we want to spread it everywhere, to everyone, and to everything.\n\nSorry I know this is unrelated but I just need to vent a little, my wife wouldn’t get the free surgery to look more like “Zalora”, even though I asked, begged and negged her for multiple days, I had enough of that today so I bashed her head in with a hammer. I’m outside of the hospital in my car, waiting for the surgeons to complete the surgery, they don’t care if she consents, “Zalora”, matters more. \n\nI am scared no longer, this post is now meant to spread the word for those who do not know of the “flow”, we accidentally found, or should I call it…\n\n“Zalora”",

        "text": "Another boring, meaningless day draws to a close as I dump my barely touched takeout in the trash. I don’t have much of an appetite these days, sometimes I feel like I’m stuck where I am. Nothing really sparks an interest in me anymore, not since Sarah started making her nightly visits. I groan and trudge reluctantly towards the kitchen sink, which is filled with dirty plates and bowls caked in dried, crusted chunks of food. I had been putting them off for a week now, and I know I can’t leave them there forever.\n\nI wash them. It takes forever since my shitty rag can’t scrub anything off. I feel like I’ve been working on this for years when a sudden, numbing spike of dread drives itself into the back of my neck. I freeze, and my eyes glance at the wall mounted clock next to me. It reads 10:20 PM, and I know exactly what that time means. I tear my eyes away from the clock and focus solely on the dish mountain in front of me.\n\nDon’t turn around, I command myself. Just stay focused, ignore it.\n\nThe front door slowly creaks open, even though I am certain I locked it. I hear the sound of boots dragging themselves towards me. My breath shortens and my body tenses. I squeeze my eyes shut and pray it leaves me alone. I feel its eyes boring into the back of my head, and I only relax the slightest bit when I hear it take a seat at the kitchen table. \n\n“Hey, Jeremy,” it greets, almost casually if not for the clipped edge in its tone. “Got a second?”\n\nI exhale slowly and resume scrubbing away at a fork. “Y-Yeah,” I force out. “H-How’s it…going?”\n\nA scoff. “It’s going like shit, honestly!” it exclaims, and I can imagine it throwing up its hands in frustration. “First I wake up late for work because that goddamn neighbor I keep complaining about kept partying all night AGAIN! Seriously, I have half a mind to make a fucking noise complaint already! I caught sight of that asshole when I got in my car too. All smiles and waving at me like he didn’t give me sleep deprivation. Seriously, what a dick!”\n\nI nod in agreement, even though I know that neighbor committed suicide six months ago after his girlfriend cheated on him. Behind me, there’s a subtle shift in movement that sends alarm bells ringing in my head. The chair groans with age as the thing sitting it stretches and sighs.\n\n“So of course I get to work and my boss is just THE WORST!” it continues with a bitter snarl. “He’s saying dumb shit like ‘you made a commitment to the team’ and ‘we need every cog in order to function’.” \n\nIt’s getting frustrated. The atmosphere plummets into a freezing temperature. I see my breath condense in front of me, and it’s getting hard to breath. It feels like water fills my lungs. I grip a bowl so tight it cracks down the middle. The thing stops talking and I feel it gazing at me again. \n\n“You okay, Jeremy?” it asks, almost innocently. \n\n“…” I open my mouth but no sound comes out. It still feels like I’m choking. A sensation of cold, bitter water rushing into my throat prevents me from speaking. I almost collapse but grip the sides of the sink like a lifeline. Instead of speaking, I nod silently.\n\nA moment stretched over an eternity passes by. The thing sighs and I hear it lean back in its seat. “Anyway…” it trails off, still gazing at me. I wave for it to continue, and it does. “So now everybody is acting like the reason we’re behind on our project is ME, which is bullshit! Like hell it is, I’m the only thing keeping these idiots afloat, they’d all be clueless without me. Especially the boss, I swear he only got the job because of his daddy’s money!”\n\nIt’s true, but what I don’t say is that the boss got caught in a laundering scandal that got him fired and disowned by his father a year ago.\n\n“So I’m basically strong armed into staying in late while everybody else gets to go have fun, you know? So now I’m doing everybody else’s work like ALWAYS, except this time there’s no getting a thank you afterwards. It’s complete bullshit, you know?” It growls angrily and I hear its nails claw into the wooden kitchen table. It lets out a short, shallow breath and grumbles something under its breath.\n\n“So finally I get out at like 10:15, and I just can’t wait to get home at this point. But then just when I’m passing over the bridge, I find this asshole is tailing right behind me. And of COURSE his fucking high beams are practically blinding me! So I’m trying to speed up to get away from this guy but he just keeps following me, and then if you can believe it-“ \n\nIt stops talking. Silence hangs over us as it lets out a wet, shaking breath. “It…bumps into me,” it whispers. “And I lose control of the car and…and I…I-“\n\nSadness fills me as it struggles to comprehend what happened. I want to comfort it but I can’t bear to look at it. I’ve only caught a glimpse of it once before and I wouldn’t wish that sight on my worst enemy.\n\nPale and bloated, covered in a slimy sheen of river water. Half its face rotted away, glaring at me with eyeless sockets…\n\nA misshapen, bloated hand rests itself on my shoulder. Terror strikes me like a bullet as I realize it had crawled to me. I begin to hyperventilate and shiver intensely as a ragged, waterlogged breath caresses my ear. Shit, shit, fucking shit! It’s not supposed to be this close! Why is it on me?! I wonder if I’m going to die, if it has finally become too lonely and wishes to bring me into its eternal suffering.\n\n“It’s just not fair, is it?” it whispers to me. My eyes sting with tears as a vile, ungodly stench that reeked like cold, rotten meat permeated around me. It’s broken nails dig deep into my shoulder, drawing out pinpricks of blood. “Why did today have to be so shit? What did I do to deserve this? To live like this?”\n\nI have no answer, I can’t think of a single thing I could say to salvage this. I become aware of piss streaming down my quivering legs. This is it, this is how it ends for me.\n\n“…” Silence, until finally a deep forlorn sigh breaks the tension. The nails retract from my skin and the clammy hand pats my shoulder. “I guess you wouldn’t know,” it decided, and I feel its presence fading from my side. “Have a good night, Jeremy. See you tomorrow?”\n\nNo. No, dear God, no!\n\n“O-Of course…” I groan weakly. \n\n“Thank you…”\n\nIt’s gone, and I collapse to the floor in a heap. I shift into my stomach and upheave everything onto the floor. I’m practically swimming in my own vomit but I’m too relieved to be alive to care. I begin to sob, not only for my situation but also for what that thing that visits me used to be.\n\nThree years ago, my best friend Sarah lost control of her vehicle, causing it to crash over the town bridge, leading to her drowning in the river. Before she crossed the bridge that would lead to her death, she had sent me a text asking me if she could come over and vent to me about how bad her day was. \n\nI said yes, and she’s been coming over ever since.",

        "text": "When I got a degree in history, everyone said the same thing, why? I'd tell them about how much I loved the past. It was the one thing that interested me the most, and everyone would say the same thing, you can't eat that. Realistically, what do you do with a history degree? I told them there were tons of things I could do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I graduated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reality was there wasn't. My mom had a friend that worked at the World War 2 museum and said I should apply. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a job with their oral history department. They send me around to interview veterans and record their stories. It was pretty exciting until I realized not everyone had a Saving Private Ryan-type experience. Especially the ones that are still around. \"It was the best time of my life.\" \"Me and the fellas played ball.\" Blah blah. In my heart of hearts, I hoped for some crazy deathbed confession. Some dark story that a bunch of guys swore to take to their graves, but it never happened until today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told I would go to Atlanta to interview this old Rabbi, Abraham Eichhorn.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knocked at the door, and after a few minutes, this elderly man in a wheelchair opened it and invited me inside. There were cats everywhere, and based on the smell, I don't think he cared where they pissed. He led me into the living room and offered me a seat. My choice was a moldy sofa or an old wooden chair sticky with cat pee. I opted for the couch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis gig is pretty straightforward. Guys like this, who are alone all the time, have no one to talk to, so all I do is turn on the recorder and say \"so,\" and they're usually off and running. This guy was different. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went through the usual rigmarole, thanking him for his service, how we wouldn't be here without him, and he's the greatest generation, blah, blah. He nodded like he was about as tired of hearing it as I was of saying it. It was not a great start. I pressed record and asked him, \"so.\" He didn't say anything. He stared at me like he was waiting for me to speak. So I prodded him with a few basic questions, where did he grow up? What did he do before the war? Finally, he loosened up a bit and asked if he could smoke. I told him I didn't mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe lit his smoke and stared at the floor for a long time, and I was worried that maybe this was too much for him. It happens. He looked up and told me there was only one story he wanted to tell. One that has haunted him his whole life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to admit. I was intrigued. Was Rabbi Eichhorn finally going to tell me the type of story I'd been dying to hear? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe asked me to grab a helmet off the shelf behind me. He told me it was his helmet during the war. On the front was a white cross, and a Star of David was above it. Rabbi Eichhorn pointed at the cross and said he always resented wearing that little cross on his head until the night it saved his life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said he was stationed outside France. They came to a small village. It seemed quiet at first, but that night they were attacked. They had set up a field hospital in a barn. He had spent all night helping to drag the wounded back to the barn. The ones who couldn't be saved, he gave a blessing. Toward the middle of the night, he said it felt like he spent more time providing blessings than dragging the wounded back. There were so many dead. It was late, and he was exhausted. At some point, he lost track of where he was. He said the smoke was thick and obscured what little light the moon offered. The explosions and the constant stream of gunfire were deafening. All those faces of dead boys began to blend, their lifeless gaze staring past him into infinity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore he knew it, he realized he was no longer staring at the faces of dead Americans but the faces of dead Germans. He stopped, and looked around, lost and with no idea which way to go. He decided to try and retrace his steps. He saw some lights approach, so he hid till he could confirm if they were GIs or Germans. Before he saw them, he could hear them shouting in German, and his heart sank. He had heard stories about the camps and knew being a Jewish POW was not good. He shut his eyes and prayed. Then he could feel the light shine on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe opened his eyes and raised his hands. He said the Germans looked terrified, like he had caught them. One of the Germans pointed at his head and almost looked relieved. The Rabbi couldn't figure out what they were pointing at till one of the Germans said, \"Priest.\" Eichhorn said he was so afraid he just nodded. They grabbed him and dragged him deeper behind the line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn said the one German who spoke a little English kept repeating they needed a priest, they needed help. He wasn't sure what that meant or if they were taking him prisoner. All he knew was they didn't shoot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey dragged him to an old bombed-out farmhouse. The room was filled with maps and diagrams. Eichhorn assumed it was their headquarters for whatever they were doing out there. They took him into a back room, and he said the temperature seemed to drop so low he could see his breath. The room was lit only by candles, and the walls were covered with occult symbols. He had heard amongst the other chaplains about Hitler's obsession with black magic, but he had never seen any sign of it until that night. There were other soldiers in the room. They all looked scared. The English-speaking German dragged Eichhorn toward the center of the room, where an American soldier was tied to a chair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn said the GI looked unconscious at first. His shirt was open with symbols carved into his skin. Eichhorn said he had never been so scared in his life. The English-speaking German told him they had made a mistake. Eichhorn didn't know what that meant. Then the GI looked up and opened his eyes. Eichhorn said what he saw has been burned in his mind ever since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe GI's eyes had gone black, but his eyes weren't glassy or wet. They didn't reflect any light at all. They were like two dark voids of darkness. Eichhorn asked the man what his name was. The GI said, Aymer De La Croix. Eichhorn said he looked at the man's dog tags, and they read Fredrick Thomas. Eichhorn said he asked the GI who Freddy Thomas was. The GI said, \"there wasn't room for Freddy anymore.\" Eichhorn said, chills ran down his arms. He looked to the English-speaking German and asked them what they did. He said, \"followed orders.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn paused and asked if I knew what a dybbuk was. I told him no. He said they were souls who tried to escape punishment for their sins. The Germans had invoked this spirit into the Thomas and were now scared of what they had done. Thomas killed two of them after the ritual, and they now feared for their souls, which is funny coming from a German. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn said when he realized he was face to face with a dybbuk, he knew that one of the first things was not to show fear, which is easier said than done when surrounded by a room full of Germans. He was shaken with fear and watched as the dybbuk stretched the GI's face to the breaking point to smile at him. There was an explosion outside, and the whole house shook. The Americans were gaining ground. Eichhorn knew it would be a matter of time until he would be rescued, so as selfish as it sounded, he figured he just needed to appease these Germans. The dybbuk continued to smile at him and turned its head. Those empty dark eyes pierced deep inside Eichhorn, and he knew no matter what happened, he couldn't let this evil creature remain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Eichhorn said he invoked the name of God and addressed the dybbuk by its name, Aymer. He asked it what offenses it had committed. The dybbuk squirmed in its chair. Eichhorn said he asked it again. The walls exploded with gunfire. Eichhorn dropped to the ground as he watched some of the German's chest erupt from gunfire. The dybbuk laughed. A few remaining Germans ran out of the room to fire back at the Americans. The dybbuk sat undisturbed. Eichhorn said he saw an opportunity to run. He could have escaped through a back window with no Germans to watch him anymore. The dybbuk looked down at him like it could sense his thoughts. \"Run,\" it said. Eichhorn looked into those black holes and said, \"no.\" For the first time, the dybbuk looked scared because Eichhorn was no longer afraid of it. He stood up and told the dybbuk to admit its offenses. The creature squirmed, and the room began to shake. Whether it was from the explosions outside or the power of this evil being, Eichhorn didn't know. The room darkened, and he could hear the whispered cries of a thousand voices begin to rise. The dybbuk screamed and asked Eichhorn for help. Again, he demanded to know its offenses. The creature spat in his face and laughed. The gunfire outside grew closer. Bullets whizzed on either side of Eichhorn and the tied GI. \"Say your offense,\" Eichhorn screamed once more. The creature screamed back in the chaplain's face, \"Murder.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn said now that he knew the offense, he could call out the spirit. He opened his Chaplain kit, which contained a small portable ark. He grabbed seven of the Germans' candles and placed them around the dybbuk. The creature stomped its feet and screamed at Eichhorn to stop. It said the soul of the GI was not worth saving, to let it stay. Eichhorn emptied the portable ark and took out a small horn stored inside. He blew it seven times as the creature roared at him. The room shook again, and a crack in the wall opened. Eichhorn described it as if darkness could glow. He said it was like that pale silver light distortion when you close your eyes and still see a glow. The voices grew, and arms and heads reached from this crack in the wall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn bent down to light the candles as he heard more gunfire outside the walls. A German soldier ran into the room and fired from a window. He paused, saw the crack in the wall, and heard the screams of those trapped inside. The dybbuk cried out desperate pleas to be saved. The German soldier stood there, frozen in fear, as the wall exploded. The force blew out the candles and knocked over the tied GI. Eichhorn was blown into a corner of the room. He was dazed as he looked up at the sounds of screams. The German soldier had fallen toward the crack in the wall. Dozens of arms grabbed hold of him. Dark silhouettes of faces bit into his flesh. He screamed and reached toward Eichhorn as he was pulled into the void. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEichhorn said it was as if everything had gone quiet outside as he looked toward the fallen chair and saw the dybbuk had escaped. Eichhorn could hear it somewhere in the darkness. It called out to him. It told him to run, to save himself. Eichhorn took out his matches and crawled toward the candles. He heard the dybbuk move around the room. Eichhorn said, his hands were shaking as he tried to relight the candles. He got two lit when the creature grabbed him by his ankles and dragged him into the darkness. Eichhorn invoked the name of God once more, and the dybbuk let go and ran back. He moved as fast as he could toward the candles and almost had them all lit when two American soldiers came in with their guns raised. Eichhorn put up his hands and identified himself. He told them to leave, not to come back until he said it was safe. The dybbuk stepped out of the darkness with its hands raised and said not to listen to Eichhorn, that he needed the medic. Eichhorn told them not to listen and that it wasn't a man. The GIs didn't know what to do. Eichhorn told them to leave. He had to finish the ritual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dybbuk growled at him. The GIs kept their guns aimed at him. Eichhorn lit the last of the candles, he begged the soldier to leave, but they wouldn't. The dybbuk laughed. Eichhorn stood between it and the GIs and announced its offense. The dybbuk fell back to the ground. One of the GIs asked what was happening. Eichhorn said he warned them, but since they stayed, they should pray because he needed all their help. All light left the room as the crack in the wall reemerged. The dybbuk stood in front of this horrible dark light in silhouette as it tore into the flesh of the man it possessed. The screams and cries of those trapped in the wall clouded Eichhorn's mind as he struggled to finish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two GIs dropped to their knees and started praying as Eichhorn began the final part of the ritual, speaking the seven combinations of the 42-letter name of God. The dybbuk howled and cursed at Eichhorn. As he spoke the last word, he watched as the creatures from the crack in the wall tore the dybbuk from the GI's body. Eichhorn said he could see the cursed soul as these dark entities dragged it toward the ark. The soul reached for Eichhorn and begged him to save it. The entities threw the dybbuk into the ark and slammed the lid. He said in that instant, the wall sealed, and the voices vanished. Eichhorn said he and the two GIs stood in the darkness for what felt like an eternity. Thomas stood up and asked Eichhorn what was going on. The GIs took Thomas back to the field hospital. The three of them never discussed what they had seen or made any official report. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat back when he finished, unsure what to believe. Was this true? Eichhorn sat back and lit another cigarette. I asked him what had happened to the ark. He said he had sealed it and taken it with him. It was too dangerous to leave behind. It could never be opened. I asked where it was now. He pointed to a small box on the shelf behind him. My blood ran cold when I saw it was open. I asked, \"I thought you said it was sealed?\" Eichhorn smiled at me and said, \"oh, is it not?\"",

        "text": "I'm a senior at a decent college in the eastern U.S.(not specifying for privacy reasons) since the beginning of February I've noticed that something is definitely going on at my campus. Seemed normal at first, an ambulance or a fire truck here or there throughout the days and nights, I assumed it was just people drinking too much or doing something stupid like nuking a poptart in a microwave or the like. But it's definitely picking up now, I swear there's been 5 or so ambulances on my street throughout the day for the past week or so but that's not it. It's been very windy here, more than I'm used to really but there's something different about it, I've heard wind howling before, your normal whooshing sounds and such but it seems a lot sharper/higher pitched lately, sometimes it sounds like a girl screaming from far away. I didn't think much of it because I basically drown myself in horror media, and I assume it's just my brain doing some weird association thing trying to look for something to obsess or worry about so I turn on a fan in my room to try to drown out the noise while I sleep and don't think much more of it. \n\nThe past 10 days or so though I've noticed the fan isn't enough anymore the wind is a lot louder, especially at night. I've been sleeping with earplugs and that seems to have been doing the trick for the most part.\n\n\nI dont think it's in my head anymore. I stay up pretty late because my classes start at about noon so I normally spend that time in my room on my xbox playing through some games and so. It's about 3:20 or so in the morning on the 22nd and I hear this clicking sound. Nothing too concerning but it's pretty annoying, after searching my room for a bit I realize it's coming from outside. I open my window the most I can to hear better and notice there's a guy sitting in a ball near a streetlamp on the road. I can't really make out any details but it seems he's wearing a heavy coat and such. I'm about to try to yell down at him but then the thing uncurls. A moment later I'm looking at this big gangly thing that's almost as tall as the streetlamp. Long legs, long arms, looks skinny as hell and it's head is just a ball, no features on it at all. I'm at my window staring at this thing and it just WAVES at me. I shut my window and yank the blinds down and try to compose myself for the next few minutes, thinking I must be sleep deprived as all hell. I wait for what feels like hours until I feel brave enough to look around the blinds again, and its still there. I consider calling the police and telling them something thats sounds believeable like a man threatening me from outside my dorm. I grab my phone and as I bring up the keypad app, it just starts walking down the street. Its taking these massive steps and I'm watching it until i cant see it anymore. I didn't sleep that night. I didn't realize until a few hours later but that was the first night where there was no wind, no ambulances, nothing, in a very long time. \n\nI'm staying with a friend for a few days now, he's been asking if we can test out rooming for a few days to see if we wanna rent an apartment after graduation and I do not want to be alone right now. If anything else happens I'll update this post or make a part 2 but as it stands now I want to be out of here as soon as possible.",

        "text": "Me and my friend got bored one day around 11 at night but we remembered something we could go do there was a abandoned house it most have been. Abandoned no longer then 40 to 50 years we got In after a long walk that lasted 20 minutes to get there when we seem the house. It looked really beaten up plants was over grown all over the house the red paint was almost nonexistent the wood on the door. And the house was chipped and Rowlett it look like it was going to fall at anymoment but being dumb bored teenagers we still went into. The house first thing I felt they was something or someone was watching us and then the smell of the inside of this house had instore for us. It smelled like rotting food and must it was like the people who lived here didn't take anything but a few things with them before they left in a hurry the. Shoes jackets hoodies just left a few feet a side the door and the fridge and the furniture was left the house made creaking noises almost ever step into the kitchen and the hallway into the living room. The house looked a lot better in side then the outside wasn't as broken down were started to wonder why this place was. Abandoned than they was a sound up stairs sound it like something fall we looked at each other then he started walking out to the hallway then I started to follow him all the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the stairs and walked up the stairs hearing every crack and creek all the way up the stairs. It looked nowhere near as good as it did downstairs there was 2 hallways and 6 doors and we went down the hallway in front of us we went in each door we split off to one side of the hallway. To make the looking around faster there were 4. Room 1. Bedroom 1. Bathroom 1. Spare room and 1. Master bedroom they looked like the hallway but just with more stuff in them but than we heard something that. Stock me to my very core it was a deep dark laugher from the hallway we didn't go down yet we went by the stairs and seem the thing that made this laugh it had red eyes. And a black figure but it didn't look transparent like a black mist it disappeared around the door way for some reason we didn't leave then and there we just had to go see. What it was we went into the room there was nobody in there no way out but the door then we heard the laugh in the hallway I seem only. For a moment before it went down stairs we wanted going to leave right then and there but it was at the. Bottom of the stairs and all I felt was a deep hatred then the laugh and it was gone just like that we didn't wanna stay there for any longer. We starting to run down the stairs out the door into town we both went home after and talked. About what happened the next day but it didn't stop there for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dreams the laughs the sounds the whispers the dream didn't stop until my friend went back to the house when I seem him the next day after he looked like a shell of himself but he wouldn't tell me what. Happened to him but after that was the last day anyone.  Had seem of him but I know he's in that house and I will get him out of there's but I know that red eyed thing is not the only thing in that place.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grandpa was a hell of a guy for sure. He had a great life, had 3 sons, 7 grandkids and a loving wife. Thats all he needed.\n\nI remember when i was a kid i sometimes heard about his job back in the nineties. i was around 4 that time, maybe five. He was our town's priest. Everyone knowed and loved him. i heard roumors spreading about a girl from my school. Her name was Elizabeth if im right. Kids said that he was posessed cuz she would talk to himself, draw upside-down crosses and stuff like that.\n\nThe worst thing that he did (wich people saw) was smash a kid in the head with a rock because \"The voices in my head said so\". Her parents didn't know what to do so they called my grandpa. They said she might be posessed. I remember i was at home playing with my brother Jonathan., my grandpa came to us and said \"kids grandpa will be gone for a few days, behave well understood?\"\n\nWe said yes then he left. We didn't know where he was going but we did as he said. After 4 days he came back. But he wasnt the same anymore. When he arrived he was pale like a sheet that has been freshly washed. When we asked what happened he said \"nothing happened\". He sadly passed in 2010.\n\nNine years later my grandma died too so we had to clean out the house so it could be sold. I was cleaning the attic with my cousin Sebastian. We came across a big wooden box. It needed a key but we didnt know wich so we just smashed the lock with a hammer.\n\nIn it was a little black notebook. As we opened it we found writings of my late grandpa. It was about his stories. Like how we went to visit Lake Balaton in Hungary and stuff like that. But one thing caught my eye. It was about Lizzy (as the teachers called her). It read:\n\n1979.02.25: 8pm  \nI have arrived at the house. The girl was locked down in the basement on a wooden bed. He was screaming in a foreign language wich none of us knew about. It was strange. Her eyes were yellow, She was couching up blood, he was screaming in a mans voice. I started the exorcism. It went well for the most parts but she started having a seizure, the worst one i have seen yet in my career of being a priest. It was like she was coughing up bloodclouds. I had to call father Ryan from the neighbouring town. I felt like i couldnt do it for some reason.\n\n1979.02.26: 12am\n\n\\-Reveal thy name demon- Father Ryan said. But it didnt work. Nothing worked. All she did was scream and speak in latin as we found out from one of our friend. We couldnt translate it yet but she or should i say it said:\n\nVado ad patrem meum Et Michael. nihil facere potes quod stimulum fallas.\n\nWe tried as hard as we could to get out at least something from It. But nothing happened. Im starting to lose faith that its going to work.\n\n1979.02.27. 5am\n\nShe had another seizure this was the worst so far. She sit up Said something in latin then laid down and passed out. We couldnt get what she said. What a pity. We tried holy water, bible pages. Nothing worked. Im starting to believe we cant do anything. But we have to try. We have to save her.\n\n1979.02.28 9pm\n\nWe tried. I can't believe it. I couldnt save her. The last thing she said was:\n\nIm 'iens ut tardius accipere familiam tuam seorsum a piece piece et youll' satus tecum, vos fraudantes familiam relicto spumam\n\nIll probably never know what it said. Im going to quit. I cant take the burden. Its too much.\n\nThis was the last thing about the exorcism in his notebook. The scarier thing was the stuff he later wrote.\n\n2010.03.04\n\nI can see her. Yesterday she was floating above my bed speaking latin. Now i understand. It knows whhat im thinking about. It knows all my family member's names. I cant take it. I dont know what is going to happen.\n\nThe last phrase he ever wrote in this notebook was:\n\nTu quoque Michael. Im ' agnus dei cruciare vobis in mortem",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11b0zjn/my_mom_told_me_stories_of_me_sleepwalking_as_a/",
        "text": " \n\nMy mom told me stories of me sleepwalking as a kid. What I discovered, makes me question if I had ever been sleepwalking at all.\n\nWhen I was young, I used to sleepwalk. My mother would tell me these stories about myself that I would have no memory of.\n\nShe said it first started when I was around five or six years old. She had put me to bed one night, then, around an hour or so later, she heard a noise coming from down the hallway.\n\nShe shut the book she had been reading and went to investigate. She told me that she found me sitting at the kitchen table, pretending to eat. At first, she asked me what I was doing, and after not receiving a response, she approached, upon closer inspection she realized that I wasn't awake to respond. She stood there and watched me for some time, as she herself hadn't actually seen a sleepwalker before.\n\nShe said that I sat there acting as if I were eating, then I would stop and turn to the chair to my right. To her, it appeared like I was having a conversation with someone, though she mentioned that I wasn't speaking any words, more like slight whimpers and groans. I'd then laugh quietly in my seat, then continue eating.\n\nAfter nearly 20 minutes of this, I got up from my chair, took a few steps, and laid down on the floor. My mother then woke me up and told me that I needed to go back up to bed. Well, I don't remember this interaction, she told me I was incredibly confused as I thought I was in bed. She led me by the hand back to my bedroom and tucked me back in.\n\nA few months later, this happened again. My mother had gotten up in the middle of the night to get something to drink. As she walked into the kitchen she nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw a silhouette of someone standing in front of the window.\n\nShe switched on the kitchen light and saw that it was me, that I was standing in front of the glass, motionless. She walked over to me asking what I was doing. Of course, when she got closer, she saw that my eyes were shut.\n\nApparently, I stood at that window for nearly a half-hour, before turning and walking back to my bedroom. My mom followed closely to make sure I went back to bed and sure enough, I did.\n\nIt was odd for me to hear about these things I was doing after I had fallen asleep. The concept that my body would move when I had no conscious control over it made me, nervous.\n\nMy mother found it somewhat amusing, but I didn't seem to think so.\n\nOver the following year, I only sleepwalked a few times. Most of them just ended up with me getting up from my bed and wandering into another room, before falling asleep on the floor. My mother would usually find me the next morning and wake me up.\n\nThen, after nearly a year had passed, my mother had gotten up one night and while she was passing by my room, she decided to peek in on me. When she opened my door, I was nowhere to be found.\n\nShe wandered around the entire house but couldn't find me in any of the rooms. Then, as she was walking through the living room, something out of the corner of her eye caught her attention. She saw the vague outline of someone standing outside underneath one of the streetlamps.\n\nAs she turned to get a better look, she quickly realized it was me. She threw open the door and dashed outside. I was apparently standing in the center of the road, all by myself.\n\nLuckily, our street was on a dead-end and didn't see very much traffic after 9:00 p.m.\n\nShe called out my name as she ran towards me, but I didn't seem to react at all.\n\nAs she slowed her approach, she saw that I was gesturing with my arms, as if I were having a conversation with someone. She walked up to me and grabbed my wrist.\n\nWhen she did this, I apparently began to freak out. I started to shout and fight against her, as if she were some sort of beast attempting to devour me.\n\nA minute or two later, I had woken up and snapped out of my frenzy. When I came to, I asked my mother where I was, and she calmly explained that I had walked outside while I was sleeping. I apologized to her, and she led me back inside.\n\nThe months that followed, I would sleepwalk almost every other night. It had gotten so bad that my mom had taken me to a few mental health professionals. Each of them told my mother that sleepwalking is quite common in children, and that I should eventually grow out of it. They just gave her a list of things to be aware of if she finds me sleepwalking again, such as not waking me up in the middle of it, or gently coaxing me back to bed, etc.\n\nThese explanations didn't really put my mother at ease. She wanted something a bit more concrete. So, she kept searching until she came across a therapist who specialized in sleep disorders.\n\nIt's such a bizarre part of my life that I barely remember it. All the evidence I've had that I used to sleepwalk all seemed to come from my mother telling me such.\n\nI apparently spoke with this doctor numerous times and visited him at least twice a week for three months straight.\n\nThen, one day my mother stopped taking me to see him, and according to her, I hadn't had a sleepwalking episode since.\n\nNearly 15 years has passed since then, and it all just seemed more like a dream than a memory. As if it happened to somebody else, and I had just heard about it. Of course, I believed my mom. I doubt she would make up something like that. It just never really clicked that I had this problem when I was younger.\n\nThat was until I was helping my mom clean out some of her things out of her basement. She was going through all her storage and was getting rid of a bunch of old stuff. While I was pulling out boxes out of the rafters, something clattered to the floor. It was a thick manila file folder that hit the ground with a thud. Hoping I didn't break anything of importance, I stopped what I was doing and picked up the folder.\n\nAfter glancing at it, I noticed on the front that it had my name on it with some dates. I looked around to make sure my mom wasn't nearby, and I took the folder into the back of my pants. After finishing up, I told her I'd talk to her later, and I headed back home to my house.\n\nWhen I got inside, I tossed my jacket on the couch and pulled out the folder. As I peeled open one end and slid the large file out, my eyes darted across the front of it.\n\nIt was records of my time with the therapist. I guess he must have given my mother a copy of these to keep. All of the entries inside were each of the days I had gone to visit him. Most of them, were just logs of the sessions as well as a few notes he had taken throughout.\n\nOne of the last entries, however, drew my attention. It said that the therapist was going to conduct some type of hypnotherapy on me. He had me lay down on a lounge chair and began telling me to relax, while continuously asking me specific questions.\n\nHe asked me what I dream about, and my answer had been written down. I told him that I dreamed of my friend. Reading this, I had no idea who I was talking about. The therapist then asked me to describe this friend of mine.\n\nI told him that he was much taller than me, though for a child, that wasn't saying much. His body always seemed to be hunched over. He had long black hair that fell down to his shoulders. His arms were extremely long, like two snakes attached to the shoulders.\n\nThe therapist asked me to tell him what his face looked like, and I began to explain that his face, had a set of impossibly large eyes, and a smile, that was equally as large as his eyes, that stretched from ear to ear. When the therapist pressed further, apparently, I sat up in the chair, still asleep, and told the therapist to look at him for himself.\n\nI then pointed to behind the therapist, and when he turned, he saw nobody there. He jotted down some notes and then asked me what my friend wanted. I told him that he wants to take me somewhere far away, so we can both play together, forever. He made another note, then through a series of careful statements, he rid my mind of negative dreams. Well, that's what he wrote down anyway.\n\nSince that day, I have slept peacefully without any more sleepwalking incidents. All those memories I had from the early years of my life seemed hazy, and I've nearly forgotten about them all. Despite not knowing anything about those statements I made, I couldn't help but feel a bit of familiarity with the description of this friend of mine.\n\nAs I closed the file, I sighed, thinking about all the things I had said in the notes. I looked at the clock, which read 10:23 p.m.\n\nAs I stood up from my chair, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I turned and looked at my window. For the briefest of seconds, I thought I had spied someone standing outside. Someone looking at me, someone tall, with long arms. Someone, with a set of large eyes and an equally large smile, that stretched from ear to ear.\n\nI blinked my eyes and when I opened them again, it was gone. I wanted to rationalize that what I had just seen was just a product of reading these files. That my tired mind had simply conjured this hallucination.\n\nBut for some reason, I can't seem to shake this feeling, that those weren't simply dreams I had been experiencing when I was a kid. That they were something much more than dreams, something much more sinister.\n\nI can feel my eyelids starting to become heavier by the minute, and for the first time in my life, I'm worried about what will happen, if I fall asleep, again.",

        "text": "I’ve been a detective for a long, *long* time. Probably longer than some of you have been alive. Working in this field of work I’ve come across a lot of the gruesome, disturbing, and horrific things gods rejects have done to other innocent people. But in this case… I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m honestly at my wits end here and don’t know what to believe anymore.\n\nSo I’ve turned here. I’m sure many of you are experts when it comes to this stuff, so I want your honest opinions on this one.\n\nFor some context: a young woman (five foot three, blonde hair, blue eyes) was brought into the station disheveled and covered in blood and dust. Officers had picked her up after some neighbors called with some noise complaints. When they entered the residence she was crouched on the ground next to the dead body of her fiancé writing in a journal.  A bloody hammer laid on the ground next to her. \n\nStandard murder case, you crime junkies might be thinking, but it is so much more than that. And if my Sergeant ever found out I stole police evidence and posted it to social media I’d lose my job immediately. After taking this case though, I couldn’t care less. I’m getting up there in age anyway and this old fart would rather like to retire after this particular case.\n\nAnyway, I’ll just let the evidence tell you. Below are entries from a leather bound journal that was collected from the scene of the crime. The one the woman was writing in. It seems it was being used as some sort of diary/dream journal.\n\n***\nEntry #1 \n\n1/13/23\n\nHello Journal! My name is Lorelei Wilson and my fiancé George and I are going to buy our first house together! I’m keeping this as a log of our journey; from buying the house, to renovating, and hopefully to document building a nursery! Gosh, I feel like I’m thirteen again writing in my diary about my latest boy crush! Spoiler alert: it’s George! \n\nHoney if you ever read this, I love you and can’t wait to take the next step with you!\n\n***\nEntry #2 \n\n1/24/23\n\nI’m happy to announce that after almost two weeks of looking at houses on Zillow and going to a few open houses and some other house tours, I think we’ve finally found the one! 8374 Maplewood Drive for only thirteen thousand! I was surprised how cheap they were selling the place considering how beautiful the property is. Two story, four bedroom, two bath with marvelous wood flooring. The outside interior is a nice pearl white with a blue door that makes it pop! My favorite is the stereotypical white picket fence though, ha! There’s also a study on the first floor so I’m thinking of turning that into our office!\n\nNot only is the house itself beautiful but it has this intense aura about it, like it’s drawing me in somehow. It’s one of the reasons why it’s my first choice at the moment! I think we’re even going to put in an offer later today!!\n\nI wonder why the address seems so familiar to me though…\n\n***\nEntry #3\n\n1/31/23\n\nOkay I’m even more excited about buying this house now!!! Not only did our offer get accepted, but after I did some research, I figured out why the house’s address seemed so familiar to me! Turns out this is the house where Harriet Yarnsivick mysteriously disappeared into thin air five years ago. Oh George and I remember watching the news updates on the case when it was first sensationalized, but eventually the case went cold and I guess everyone forgot about it. How sad, I hope she’s okay if she’s still alive. \n\nThere was a lot of controversy surrounding the case too. Nobody knew how a girl could just up and disappear like that. All her belongings, purse, phone, and even shoes were still at the house. Police say there weren’t any signs of forced entry or anything either. Harriet lived with three other housemates and they were all questioned, but none of them had a motive and were all at a house party that night with many corroborating witnesses. The house was spick and span clean, just how the other roommates had left it.\n\nThis case is so interesting! I might update my true crime blog and document living in this house! (Lord knows I’ve been neglecting updating it!)\n\nI’ve always loved things like this, and Nancy Drew was my role model as a little girl. Who knows, maybe I’ll find clue’s Investigators missed and even solve the mystery!\n\n***\nEntry #4\n\n2/3/23\n\nIT'S MOVE IN DAY!!!\n\nGeorge thinks he’s quite funny. I had mentioned when we had arrived in the moving truck how perfect the house looked, how it stood proud and strong on its foundations. He said it was morbid then proceeded to ask why he was marrying me again. I gave him a good nudge in the shoulder for that last remark!  He knows very well that he likes the house just as much as I do, and found its history interesting, hell he co-signed the lease!\n\nAnyway we’re both super excited about living here and also super tired and exhausted from moving. On the plus side we had pizza for dinner! Ate on the floor surrounded by boxes and everything. Can’t wait for when we get the internet and cable in a few days.\n\n***\nEntry #5\n\n2/4/23\n\nI never really have been good at sleeping in unfamiliar spaces. I think my body is still adjusting to the move and my residual excitement and giddiness didn’t help either. Man, I couldn’t sleep a wink last night! Other than that, things have been fine. George got called into work today so I stayed home and started unpacking. The kitchen feels more like a kitchen with dishes in the cabinets and a proper dining table. After a short nap I’ll go to the store and stock up on food.\n\n***\nEntry #6\n\n2/6/23\n\nGeorge is mad at me. I might’ve snapped at him a little about the placement of the tv in the living room earlier. I get cranky when I’m tired and I haven’t been sleeping the best at night. But it’s okay because I’m mad at George too. The other night I could’ve sworn I heard someone knocking. I couldn’t pinpoint the location where it was coming from but the small, quiet, and repetitious knocks were there. I’m a light sleeper so I wasn’t able to go back to sleep until the knocking ended at around four in the morning. \n\nI brought it up to George in the morning, and since he’s a heavy sleeper and didn’t hear anything, he doesn’t believe me. \n\nAnyway, I finished setting up the study this morning. I found a picture of Harriet and her roommates stuck between some bookshelves so that was a cool find. She looked happy. There was a draft coming from somewhere in there though. I’ll have to fix it and put that on my to-do list.\n\n***\nEntry #7\n\n2/9/23\n\nTaking some advice from my friend Chelsea, I’m going to start dream journaling, and this just so happened to be the only available journal I had. I’m too tired to drive to the store and get another one.\n\nI’ve been able to get more sleep than I have in the past few days but not too much more. Every night until four am I’m lying awake in my bed, eyes wide open, as the knocks emanate through the house. George says he still hasn’t heard anything, but I know they’re there. Taunting me in their steady, continuous drumming. Maybe one of these days when I’m not as terrified, I’ll go and find where the knocks are coming from. \n\nBut when I am sleeping I’m having these crazy and vivid dreams. I’d never vividly dreamed before this so the first time it happened last night it felt super real.\n\nI can’t quite remember where I was but the space felt familiar. I remember feeling frantic, panicked, and scared. I had locked myself away somewhere, but I knew danger was right around the corner. Then all of a sudden this giant shadowy silhouette appeared and it lunged at me with a weapon, I think it was a hammer but I’m not sure. When it made contact with my head I woke up. I was covered in sweat and dazed. George woke up and comforted me when he saw the state I was in. I was a little less mad at him after that. \n\nMaybe these dreams are caused by my sleep exhaustion.\n\n***\nEntry #8\n\n2/10/23\n\nIf I’m not going to be getting much sleep, I might as well do something with that time. I’ve gone into a rabbit hole with the Yarnsivick case, doing research for my blog. \n\nSo Harriet had three other roommates, Joanne Harris, her brother David Harris, and another guy named Antonio Frump. Joanne and Antonio were an item and Harriet knew them all because she was Joanne’s good friend from college. \n\nA bunch of interviews from people that knew Harriet suspected that she and David were romantically involved and claimed David was responsible for her disappearance. According to police though his alibi checked out and there was no way he could’ve been there. There isn’t an estimated time of disappearance either. She really did just vanish out of thin air. \n\nSince there was no other information about the case available online I turned to social media.\n\nAt some point I had fallen asleep while scrolling and I had the same vivid dream from the other night. This time it was more intense, I could feel the hatred and anger coming off the shadow figure. It was angry, determined, desperate. I could make out my surroundings now and realized why it was so familiar. \n\nIt was the study. \n\n***\nEntry #9\n\n2/14/23\n\nThis dream was different from the other one that’s been playing on repeat the past few nights. It was like a movie. I think I’ve been digging too much into this case because it’s infecting my mind. In the dream I was Harriet. I was at a house party just chilling along with Jo and then her brother, David, entered the room. I think it was the first time I had seen him because it felt like my heart started racing and he looked cute, but unfamiliar. He was charming, funny. Knew how to make me laugh. I had an overall good time. \n\nThe dream ended after he handed me a red solo cup full of some liquid.\n\nAfter I woke up I started digging through my notes. Surely enough Jo and Harriet had met at a house party, but I didn’t find anything about David being there. \n\nAh shit, I forgot it was Valentine’s Day! George came home pissed while I was researching. He slammed the front door, threw a pretty bouquet of flowers at my feet, and then angrily grumbled up the stairs to our bedroom. I had accidentally stood him up. Oh I forgot I was supposed to meet up with him for dinner after his shift ended! I was too busy digging through old notes that I didn’t check my phone to see his texts or calls.\n\nLosing all this sleep has made me super forgetful. \n\n***\nEntry #10\n\n2/16/23\n\nOK either I’m fucking loosing it or the knocking has started during the day time too. It feels like whatever is in the walls is surrounding me. Knocking twenty for seven, trying to get out. My head is pounding. I begged George to believe me, to call an exterminator to check for mice, anything but he won’t. He hasn’t been home or awake, so he hasn't heard the knocking. Even when I hear it he doesn’t.\n\nI wish George would get over Valentine’s Day and just help me. He’s made me sleep on the couch for the past few days.\n\nResearching and updating my blog is all that comforts me.\n\n***\nEntry #11\n\n2/18/23\n\nWe had sex. SO MUCH SEX! We fuck like bunnies, David and I. In my dreams I mean…\n\nBut he’s so sweet and handsome though. He takes me out on dates, plays with my hair, just a genuine guy. And Joanne. My dear, sweet, Joanne. She’s so supportive of our relationship and happy for me and her brother. It’s like we’re soulmates.\n\nJeez these dreams feel so real, like I’m actually her.\n\nSometimes I like to think I am Harriet. \n\nBut the only thing that tethers me is the rumors of David and her being an item. There’s no proof. David, Joanne, and Antonio all denied them being in a relationship to the press and to the police.\n\nFuck I’m so horny. Maybe David and I can have a little fun later when he comes home from work.\n\nOops! Silly little me, I meant George. Maybe I’m actually starting to lose my marbles.\n\n*** \nEntry #12\n\n2/19/23\n\nGeorge has officially lost it! He’s having me involuntarily committed! All because he came home to a mess in the study today! \n\nSo I might’ve had a dream where David showed a notebook of poems he had written to Harriet. I woke up and remembered seeing it somewhere in the study. After I didn’t find it in the book shelves I kinda went haywire and tore up the office a little bit. But I SWEAR I had seen that notebook before. I really do need to find the source of that draft, it’s freezing in there!\n\nHe says this was his last straw. “I’m sleep deprived and delusional!” Me? Delusional?!? He’s the crazy one if he can’t hear the incessant knocks that comes from the fucking walls everyday! Me, crazy! Guess that’s why he’s sending me to the nut house.\n\nI’m seriously reconsidering our engagement.\n\nDavid would’ve made a better husband than George anyway.\n\nI’m sneaking my journal in with me &gt;:)\n\n***\nEntry #13\n\n2/20/23\n\nDavid is an abusive asshole and I wish I never fell in love with him! The red flags were there this whole time! He was super possessive of me everywhere we went, he wouldn’t let me talk to other boys, and he accused me of cheating on him every other week! Now he’s finally done it. He’s hit me! \n\nI’ve turned into his personal punching bag the past few days. I’m scared and terrified of setting him off again. And Jo! She just stands by and lets it happen. I’ve begged her to help me but she won’t, claiming that he’s her brother and she’d never do anything to ruin his reputation. Some fucking friend.\n\nI’ve started looking for other places to live. I’m going to do it. I’m going to leave David once and for all.\n\n***\nEntry #14\n\n2/21/23\n\nI’ve been released from my seventy two hour hold. They haven’t found anything wrong with me and I just slept for most of the time. I feel much better now. My head isn’t swimming anymore and I’m not tired. I think I slept for a good twentyish hours in there. George was so happy to see me, and I him. We had a nice long hug when he came to pick me up. \n\nI think things are going to get better from here on out.\n\n***\nEntry #15\n\n2/22/23\n\nITS SO LOUD! The knocking. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, KNOCK, KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! MAKE IT STOP!\n\nEver since I got back yesterday it’s been constant non stop knocking. I have a headache. Eventually I passed out due to the pain.\n\nDavid did it. He killed me. He found out I was planning on leaving him and he freaked. I was going to make my escape when they were at the house party. He somehow found out and left the party to come confront me. When he cornered me… he tried to rape me. I eventually got away and hid in the study. He smashed my phone so I couldn’t call for help or do anything. He smashed the doorknob off with a hammer. When he realized I wouldn’t go back to him he killed me! Bashed my skull in with the hammer! You want to know the worst part? I was still alive when he stuffed me in that wall. I watched as he replaced the broken door knob. Screamed in horror as he moved the bookshelf in front of the small hole he had created. I cried and cried but nobody heard me. Eventually I passed out from exhaustion and suffocated.\n\nI know where the banging is coming from. I have one of George’s hammers, and I grabbed it from his tool bag. I’m headed for the study. \n\nI’m ending it, once and for all.\n\nIt feels like a jackhammer is drilling into my ears. The knocking is the loudest in the study. I’m just so over it! My head is pounding! I’m tired, exhausted! I just want it to STOP! \n\nI was scared! David came downstairs when he heard me smashing the bookcases in the study. He yelled at me, screamed! I was so scared he was going to hit me. Kill me again. I hate David! I hate him with a burning passion!\n\nEverything was crescendoing around me! The knocking was so loud it felt like my brain was about to explode. David was screaming in my ear, grabbing me, trying to hurt me! I just wanted everything to stop. I wanted him to stop hurting me!\n\nI hit him in the head with my hammer. Then I hit him again and again until his brains turned to mush. I just have to laugh. I finally got revenge on David. Did what that fucker did to me. He’s quiet now. Quiet is good.\n\nThen I went back to hitting the wall. With every hit the knocking diminished. Finally it was quiet when the bookshelf was destroyed. It was peaceful.\n\nThere was a small hole in the wall that was hidden behind the bookshelf.\n\nI found her. I found Harriet.\n\nThere’s flashing red and blue lights outside. Good. They’ll be able to help. \n\n***\n\nI really don’t know if this journal will be enough evidence to convict David Harris for the murder or Harriet Yarnsivick. These are more like the ramblings of a madwoman than a credible confession. I don’t know if the prosecution will see this as admissible in court. \n\nAs for Lorelei Wilson, she’s being charged for the murder of her fiancé George Finch. They found him with his head bashed in. Brain matter and skull fragments everywhere. Poor guy. They found Lorelei scribbling in the journal when they entered the scene. In the wall they found the skeletal remains of Ms. Yarnsivick. Her skull had been bashed in. \n\nIt appears her assailant killed her, moved the bookshelf and created a makeshift grave in the wall where they stuffed her body and moved the bookshelf back.\n\nI have no clue how investigators didn’t smell the decomposition, or notice that the bookshelf had been moved, but the tenants quickly moved out after the girls disappearance and the house was left vacant for five years. Nobody complained of  a rotting smell in that time. \n\nAgain, I really don’t know what to believe here. It seems like Ms. Yarnsivicks ghost haunted Ms. Wilson and drove her insane until she discovered her remains. But that’s crazy right? Ghosts don’t exist! \n\nAnyway I better finish up here, it seems like someone is knocking at my door.",

        "text": "My daughter is 22 now and I am so guilty for the way I treated her. Her dad left us when she was a baby, and as a young mom in her 20’s I didn’t want or have the ability to care for her the way I should have. \n\nI used to leave her in the living room at night time while she was a baby while I would have sex with men. I would smack her as a toddler and pull her hair. I let one of my ex boyfriends bring his dog over even tho she would get asthma attacks and break out in hives. She had to go to the hospital, but after I still let him come over with the dog because I wanted the company. I didn’t do anything when my other ex boyfriend grabbed her arm a few times. I would scream and yell at her at 2 years old and leave her in a dark hallway at night until she banged on the front door for her grandmother in fear. \n\nAs she got older, I ended up treating her worse. I would pull her hair so hard, her head would have a lump. I would monitor how often she showered , and I would hide most of the food in my bedroom closet. I would yell and scream at her for sneaking food. I didn’t let her use any appliances. I wouldn’t let her shower whenever she pleased. And would only let her bathe for a few min. I let my mother buy her what she needed like bras. Soap. Personal items. I wasn’t made to be a mother. I neglected her. I let her have lice in her hair and didn’t help her. The bugs were crawling all over her face. I made her sleep and eat on the floor so she wouldn’t mess up the furniture. She would say how bad her back hurt but I didn’t care. \n\nI told her about my sex life. Shook my boobs and danced provocatively as a joke because I am a nymphomanic. She’s seen porn on my computer. Disgusting messages. I told her things I shouldn’t have. Like the number of sexual partners, what I did in college, dick sizes.  \n\nShe had a rabbit and I didn’t let her take it out of her cage. I have OCD and didn’t want it to make a mess everywhere. Over time, I wouldn’t let her put it in her room so I put the rabbit in a dark laundry room and removed the lamp so it sat in darkness 24:7. I didn’t want to pay for the light bill. She had to beg my mom to get it food. Then I killed it by accident because it was so dirty from its filth, I gave it a bath with a hose and it had a seizure and died. I didn’t know rabbits would die from being wet. I remember her screaming and yelling and I was too busy fighting with my boyfriend at the time. \n\nI would tell her disgusting things. Call her fat. Say she had a balloon face. A loser. Tell her “that’s why you have no friends at school “ “that’s why your dad left you” I also told her I wish I never fucked her dad. She was between 8-12. \n\n\nOne time, when I was having a stressful day, she was always defiant. And put a chocolate bar in my thanksgiving turkey. I was so angry I took mayonnaise and shoved it in her face. Up her nose. Down her throat. Until she threw up and cried. She always had a sensitivity with mayonnaise since she was a toddler, and I would sometimes use it to threaten her as punishment. Now she eats like a child, and has a fear of foods. \n\nWhen she ended up cutting herself, I didn’t get her help. I didn’t let her see a doctor when she had strep throat , and she almost died of an asthma attack because I was too tired to be bothered in the middle of the night. I told her to call the ambulance herself. But then followed her to the hospital. \n\nI didn’t let her get a license or a permit or a bank account because I didn’t want to be responsible for her reckless behavior. \n\nShe ended up getting sexually abused @ 14 by her music teacher who’s 23. She told me they just kissed. So I messaged him and told him to stop talking to her. He didn’t. And I found out recently it was way more than what she told me. I broke down in tears from the guilt. \n\nOnce she was about 15-16 she was running away and drinking and I just gave up on her and counted the days until she was 18 so she wasn’t my responsibility anymore. She felt the same. \n\nI told her to go live with another family member when she was 17. All she did was smoke weed and not listen or follow my rules. I have heard from her maybe 3 times\n\nI love my daughter. I feel guilty but she never wants to speak to me again. I thought since I never sexually abused her or beat her until she had bruises, it wasn’t abuse. I made mistakes. She now struggles with substance abuse issues. But Is a kind and empathetic person. She’d give the shirt off her back for anybody. She was just so hyper and bratty. And a hard kid. Maybe because of her ADHD. And I never wanted to be a mother.",

        "text": "One child, that was our plan. *One*. We could juggle a single ankle biter with our careers no sweat.\n\nBut then at the ultrasound, the cheery technician clapped her hands together, smiled, and said, “I’ve got some exciting news!”\n\nFast-forward a few months, and our dear friend Mr. Stork dropped off Darren, Deborah, and Daniel…\n\nIn that first year, my wife and I probably got a solid 20 minutes of shut-eye. Combined. Friends and family noted we’d become like the walking dead, sleepwalking through 3AM feeds, naps, and even bath time. It got so bad, Alison joked about stapling her eyes open.\n\nThe impact spilled over into our professional lives, too. I’d wake up at my office desk only to find the keyboard soaked in warm drool, whereas Alison nearly walked into an operating theatre with poop smeared across her forehead.\n\nGood thing the nurse who noticed took pity on the stressed mother and promised to keep her mouth closed, otherwise Alison might have sown it shut for her.\n\nYou won't be surprised to learn our romantic lives took a hit. However, there was light at the end of the tunnel. Surely, once our offspring got past the dreaded ‘terrible twos’, parenthood would become more manageable?\n\nWrong. It got worse.\n\nDarren never quit kicking Deborah, who wouldn’t stop tugging Daniel’s hair, who…well, I can’t really fault Daniel. He was a great kid.\n\nMaybe you’re thinking I didn’t love my children, that’s not true—I *adored* them. Darren would have me laughing so hard my ribs hurt with the little comedy shows he put on for me and the stuffed animals; Deborah could tell you the difference between the Triassic period and the Cretaceous Period with the aid of her dinosaur models; and Daniel had those big blue eyes everybody fawned over.\n\nTogether, they were just hard work is all.\n\nMy stomach did a somersault when my dearly beloved first made her suggestion.\n\n“You want to get rid of them?” I asked, struggling to pry Deborah’s fist open so she’d release Daniel’s hair.\n\n“Think of it more like…downsizing. We’d just find a new family for one of them.” Her eyes flicked down toward Darren, who she held by the arms as he twisted like a fish to try kicking his sister from across the room. “Or maybe two.”\n\nIt shouldn’t have surprised me, honestly. That cold, detached nature is what made her such an incredible surgeon; she operated with complete ice in the veins, 100% focused on any given task.\n\nAfter separating the rowing pups, we wrangled everybody into bed and went down to the kitchen, sweaty and exhausted.\n\n“Well we have to do something,” Alice snapped, already going at the wine. “Three kids are way too much trouble. We need to make this situation more…manageable.”\n\nIn the end, the discussion got sent back to the jury, unvoted on, until I returned home from my work trip.\n\nAlice’s proposal played on my mind the whole way to London and back. How could she even make such an awful suggestion? As much as I complained about the triplets, I sorely missed them whenever we were apart. I missed the way they shared their biscuits and juice with me anytime I worked from home, or how all three of them fell asleep with their heads against my chest when I read them a bedtime story, and the way I needed to slither out from beneath them without waking anybody.\n\nBack home, when the front door swung open, my gut immediately told me something was off. The silence sent shivers racing along my spine. Our Volvo sat parked in the driveway, yet the house wasn’t a war zone, why? I hurried along the hall, shouting everybody’s names.\n\nIn the lounge, my wife’s surgical gown hung from the mantelpiece, along with discarded latex gloves caked in dried, crusty blood.\n\nHuddled together on the sofa were the kids, all watching Paw Patrol peacefully. They weren’t wrestling over the remote or knocking over side tables.\n\nDarren sat closest to me, *not* kicking his sister. Had we turned a corner? Had the kids finally, finally, finally grown out of this ‘fighting’ phase?\n\nI almost cried tears of joy until my brain cogs ground to life, slowly processing the *real* reason for this little armistice...\n\nMy son’s legs were gone. Beneath his shorts, two chicken drumsticks poked through, ending well above where the knees should have been.\n\nA huge lump formed in my throat as my eye travelled towards Deborah, whose arms had gone AWOL, replaced instead with pink, rounded pencil erasers poking out of her sleeves. The room seemed to shift on its axis as I finally looked at Daniel, who licked a lollipop quite happily. \n\n“Want some daddy?” he asked, holding it out towards me.\n\nAlice stepped through the door, wiping her hands off with a damp rag. And then, I could only stand there, paralysed by fear, as she proudly explained the ingenious way she’d found of [making our children more ‘manageable’...](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",

        "text": "When my face started peeling, I thought it was the new face wash I had recently bought. My friend recommended it, and it was rated 10.0 on the best of lists on several websites.\n\nI was disappointed because the few times I used it, I really liked it, but I couldn’t chance it.\n\nI threw the cleanser in the trash.\n\nTwo days later, my face was still peeling, and it was much worse. It was so dry, the texture akin to snakeskin. I racked my mind for a possible cause but couldn’t think of any.\n\nNot only did it look disgusting, but it itched like absolute hell. I found myself scratching absentmindedly.\n\nI scratched so hard that I drew blood. I only noticed when I glimpsed my red fingertips. My nail beds were clogged with chunks of skin.\n\nI finally realized that something was very wrong when I went to get my hair done.\n\nI went to my stylist to get my standard summer box braids. When she was done, she dipped my braids into a boiling pot of water and carefully wrapped my hair in a towel so I wouldn’t get burned.\n\nWhen she took the towel away, she gasped, and my heart thumped painfully.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I asked, but she didn’t answer.\n\nI snatched her mirror off the table and peered at my reflection.\n\nI screamed.\n\nEvery braid had come out of my head. Some clung to my scalp hanging by bloody, viscous threads.\n\n I watched as a trail of dark blood slowly dripped from my skull and trickled down my nose.\n\nI slammed down the mirror and ran outside to my car. I blocked the stylist as she repeatedly called me to ask for payment.\n\nBy the time I got home, all of my hair was gone--every single strand and most, if not all, of my scalp.\n\nMy skin fell off in long bloody strips. My face formed boils that burst and spurted foul yellow pus. My eyes which have always been my best feature, were now wet with thick mucous and yellow, like the eyes of a reptile.\n\nI looked into those eyes. My once beautiful eyes and\n\nI remembered.\n\nIt was a memory I had tossed aside because I didn’t deem it important to remember.\n\nMy cousin’s birthday was a week ago. She had always been into that mystic, spooky bullshit.\n\nThe woman she hired referred to herself as a spiritualist. She told us we were going to host a seance. She ignored my laugh and the roll of my eyes.\n\nWe lit red candles and turned off the lights, and then we sat in a circle and held hands.\n\nThe Spiritualist chanted a name. I remember how uneasy the name made me feel. When I opened my eyes, the woman was staring right into my eyes.\n\nI was unnerved, but I wouldn’t show it. I had drank quite a bit, and it annoyed me that I had to sit through this shit.\n\nShe kept looking at me, and I refused to back down.\n\nAnd then she smiled, and my vision went completely black.\n\nI heard screams, and I felt flames lick at every part of my body.\n\nI tried to scream, but my mouth was sewn shut. My skin turned black and peeled.\n\nI saw her then.\n\nShe had her back turned to me. She was tall and thin and had the most beautiful black hair I had ever seen.\n\nShe looked at me, and this time I did scream. My fear forced me to wrench my mouth open. I didn’t even register the pain.\n\nShe had no face, and what skin clung to it mottled her blue, black, and gray.\n\nShe lurched towards me and tapped my forehead with a gnarled, bloated finger.\n\nShe caressed the contours of my cheeks, encircled the hollows of my eyes, and traced patterns on my lips.\n\nShe gripped the underside of my jaw, and with a surprising strength, she sank her fingers into my flesh and tore off the entirety of my face.\n\nThe world burned, and I screamed again. I never thought it possible to scream without lips.\n\nShe fit my face over that empty canvas of hers. She smiled at me, and I drained away.\n\nHell was here for me, and my body sank into its fires. I smelled burning; I heard screaming. I\n\nI awoke on the floor, dripping wet and reeking of alcohol. My cousin and her friends surrounded me. They looked confused and concerned.\n\n“What happened?” I asked, snatching the towel offered to me.\n\nMy cousin told me that I had fallen and then started screaming. They didn’t know what to do, so she, my cousin, threw a glass of water on me.\n“Where the fuck is she?” I spat. I took out my compact mirror and vigorously checked my flawless reflection.\n\n“Where is who?” My cousin asked.\n\n“That bitch,” I said. “That spiritualist! She did this. She did something to me.”\n\nMy cousin looked at me as though I were crazy.\n\n“There was no spiritualist here, Bree.” She gestured to her friends. “Just us.” She peered at me. “Are you sure you’re okay? I think you might have drank too much.”\n\nI pushed past her to grab another glass of wine.\n\n“No, the problem is I haven’t drunk enough.”\n\nSo, I drank more, and I forgot. I forced myself to forget.\n\nI don’t believe in the supernatural, at least I never used to, but now, as I was losing everything, I believed. \n\nI believed some demon bitch had taken my face and given me hers.\n\nEvery time I looked at my reflection, I cried.\n\nWhat else did I have if I was no longer beautiful? I was not known for kindness. My personality did not win me friends.\n\nI have always been an indescribable beauty. The kind of beauty that countries go to war over. And now I was a monster because that bitch had stolen my fucking face. I didn’t know what to do anymore, so I cried.\n\nMy tears burned and made holes in my skin.\n\nI’ve been holed up in my bathroom for days now. I broke my mirror with my fist and shattered it with my brittle bones.\n\nThere are shards everywhere--reflections of me. I can’t escape it. I can’t run from myself.\n\nI give up. To whatever took my face, congrats! You win!\n\nI no longer want to see what I look like. I am tired of seeing my soul reflected at me.\n\nI thought I would be able to see her. I wanted her to appear. If I saw her, I would reach out and tear off MY face. I would take back what was mine.\n\nShe doesn’t appear, though, and why would she? She’s gotten everything she wanted, and I don’t have much time left.\n\nI am so tired. I’ll close my eyes and rest for a moment.\n\nI just want to sleep because if I sleep, then perhaps I will dream, and I will get lost in the memory of my beauty.",

        "author": "the-third-person",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11aqxvh/i_died_last_week/",
        "text": "I died last week.\n\nNot for too terribly long, in the grand scheme of things. Thirty-eight seconds. That was all it took until the doctors restarted my heart and I came back. It felt like a lot longer to me, though.\n\nI never really thought about the afterlife much. If I’d been asked about it, I would have said that there wasn’t one, that it doesn’t make any sense for there to be some intangible part of ourselves that carries on after we die. That’s the only logical answer.\n\nTurns out death isn’t logical. What I experienced while my heart was stopped convinced me of that.\n\nThe experience was, in a lot of ways, shockingly generic. Everything just stopped. The world went silent in a way I’d never experienced before. The blackness around me slowly brightened into a dim grey, and I was standing in an endless plain. It stretched out all around me like an ancient sea bed, featureless and eternal.\n\nUp ahead there was a bright light, the source of all of the ambient light around me. It called to me, beckoning me forward with a sense of peace and acceptance. My footsteps made no sound as I walked toward it. I left no marks on that forgotten land. My shadow stretched out behind me, wiping away any trace of my passing.\n\nAs I drew closer to the light, I began to feel a slight discomfort. Something was wrong—not with the light, but with something the light could not see. My feet continued to carry me forward; they were moving automatically, and I don’t think I could have stopped if I’d wanted to. But I began to look around, trying to find the source of this unpleasant sensation.\n\nThere was nothing to my left, nothing to my right. The plain faded out into the darkness on both sides. There was no place for anything to hide. There was nothing at all.\n\nBehind me there was only my shadow, moving as I moved. And yet—was it mine? It was here that I felt the discomfort most keenly, craning my neck back to watch the dark, distorted version of myself dragging along the ground behind me. There was something concealed within the shadow, something disguised and disgusting. It was following me, using me to get close to the light. It would use me to get inside.\n\nI tried to stop walking, but the pull of the light was too powerful. I looked desperately around for something to grab onto to stop myself, but there was nothing. I drew closer and closer to the light. I could feel its warmth and radiance on my face, but at the same time I felt the coldness and anticipation of the thing behind me like iron nails on my back.\n\nI knew it should not be allowed into the light. I knew it was a thing of destruction. I simply had no way to stop it.\n\nIts claws dug into my back in preparation. I could feel it coiling to spring free. I flailed my arms behind me, trying to grab it, but touched nothing but air. The light was in front of me, almost touching me. I took the penultimate step.\n\nAbruptly I was awake and in pain again. Medical personnel leaned over me, shining lights into my eyes. I was back in the world, where things were loud and complicated and beautiful.\n\nI didn’t tell anyone about my experience. Why would I? Near-death experiences are so common in hospitals that they’re just another acronym, NDEs. It’s just something dying people go through,the final spasms of a brain refusing to admit that it is on its way out. A psychologist would probably have a lot to say about what I thought I’d seen, but the medical doctors wouldn’t even make a note on my chart.\n\nThey discharged me from the hospital two days later. I was fine when I went home. I nearly sideswiped a car getting onto the interstate, but I was fine. For all that it could have ended badly, it was a minor mistake. The other driver had been more attentive and all it really meant was that I should not have been driving myself. I slowed down, focused my attention and made it home safely.\n\nI tripped going up the brick staircase of my house, nearly braining myself on the baluster of the railing. I flung my hands out and caught myself in time, though I threw my keys into the bushes in the process. As I hunted for them, I berated myself for my clumsiness and swore I would get some rest as soon as I made it inside.\n\nI reached my bed without further incident, and settled gratefully into its soft and non-dangerous embrace. I tossed my clothes to the side and let the glow of the television lull me to sleep.\n\nDreams of being buried alive plagued my sleep. I woke to find the sheet wrapped around my head, stifling my breathing. It was twisted tightly enough that at first, I could not find my way free. Adrenaline spiked in my system as I clawed at my face, finally finding the loose end of the blanket to free myself.\n\nIt was too early to be awake, but going back to sleep was not in the cards, so I made my way blearily to the kitchen and poured myself a bowl of cereal. I was at the table, spoon halfway to my mouth before it finally registered that I had never opened the refrigerator. Whatever I’d poured on my cereal had not been milk.\n\nThe chemical smell rising from the bowl suddenly hit me. I looked down in horror at the spoonful of corn flakes and Drano that I had been about to eat. Somehow I had opened the cupboard under the sink instead of the refrigerator. I had not noticed as I poured toxic chemicals onto my food. I had almost eaten it.\n\nI called the hospital. They told me that I had had a traumatic experience, and mild confusion was nothing to be worried about. They said I could come back in if I was worried. I remembered the car I had almost hit on the way home, the one I had totally failed to see, and told them I’d think about it.\n\nThere were far too many cars on the road for me to even consider driving myself in this state. I considered calling for a ride share, but put the phone down with the app unopened for some reason. I wasn’t sure why. I knew going back to the hospital would be a good idea. I just couldn’t seem to muster up the energy to do anything about it.\n\nNot that I was lethargic, mind you. Despite the early hour, I could not stop thinking about all of the things that needed to get done around the house. Minor chores, like sharpening the knives, cleaning the bathroom and clearing the gutters.\n\nOr, to put it another way, playing around with sharp objects, dangerous chemicals and high spaces. I firmly put myself back to bed.\n\nI couldn’t sleep. I was antsy. I kept thinking about that light. I wanted to get back to it.\n\nMy motivation disturbed me, though. When I had been caught up in the light, it had felt pure and natural. Stepping into it would have been a gentle, inescapable act. What I felt for it now was eagerness laced with greed. It was a perversion, tainting the memory. It made me feel unclean.\n\nI took a shower to wash off the sensation. I was careful in the bathroom, checking the water several times to make sure I had not turned it to a scalding level, ensuring that I had not somehow replaced my shampoo with a bottle of bleach. Everything was fine, so I stepped into the shower and let the water wash me clean.\n\nAs I reached for the soap, my shadow slid across the shower wall. I stared at the path it had taken and slowly waved my hand again, disbelieving what I had seen. The shadow moved back, repeating what I had noticed: droplets of water were dislodged in its wake.\n\nI tried it several more times. Each time, the result was the same. My shadow had a small but undeniable physical presence. I could not feel it on my skin, but I could see its effects. Something was hiding within.\n\nI spent the rest of the day trying to make my house safer. I tied shut the cabinets with the cleaning chemicals. I locked up the contents of the medicine cabinet. I disconnected the garbage disposal.\n\nOver and over again, I thought about calling for help. I could never quite make myself do it, though. It bothered me less than it should have, which was itself a concerning sign. I am not alone in my own self.\n\nI’m glad the doctors brought me back. I don’t know what manner of creature has attached itself to me, what sort of thing could exist on that vast, unmarked plain at the end of life. I know that it should not be allowed into that light, though. It’s far too gleeful at the prospect. It has to be kept out.\n\nMy mind is wandering more and more. I found myself absent-mindedly pressing the tines of a fork into my skin yesterday. I wake up in the middle of every night with the sheets wrapped around my head. Today, I felt my own hands holding the knot in place.\n\nIt has to be kept from that light.\n\nI just don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/)",

        "text": "My hometown, Borozdino, around 40 hours east of Moscow, has been quietly removed from existence. You can no longer find it on any maps, or on the internet. I escaped, and now I need to warn you about what happened, because, I think this was just the start.\n\nI remember the small town of Borozdino as it was before the rain, surrounded by rolling hills and vast fields of crops. The town was quaint and quiet, with a population of only a few thousand people who were tightly knit and friendly to outsiders, on the extremely rare occasion an outsider ever visited. We were not exactly on anyone’s list of must-visit places. And most people who left Borozdino never came back, except to occasionally visit old relatives.\n\nThe town's center was marked by a large square that hosted a bustling open-air market. The market was surrounded by small shops and cafes, an onion-domed Orthodox Church and a Soviet-era municipal building.\n\nBut everything changed in an instant when the rain arrived, and I'll never forget the terror that followed.\n\nIt started as a gentle rain that slowly intensified until it became a deluge. The once calm streets of Borozdino transformed into rushing rivers, and the tranquil countryside became a mire of water and debris. The sound of rain hitting the rooftops and windows was relentless, and the wind was howling outside.\n\nSomething inside me told me it was best to stay inside, and I huddled in my home, seeking shelter from the relentless storm. The rain fell unabated for days, causing widespread damage and chaos. The power went out, and the internet and phone lines went down. My once peaceful hometown now felt like a place of despair and isolation.\n\nDuring those days, I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of unease. The storm seemed to have a malevolent energy to it, as if it was something more than just a natural phenomenon. It was as if the rain was trying to wash away the town, to cleanse it of its inhabitants.\n\nAfter three or four days the rain finally eased. It was still coming down, but no longer was it as thick and heavy, like a waterfall on our town. I opened my door to stand in the  doorway, and was immediately assaulted with a smell that I could not place. The closest thing I could describe it as is a mixture of sewerage and candy, one part sweet, the other repulsive. It almost smelt like it was coming in waves. The streets were covered with a layer of water, which had an almost sparkly luminance running through it. \n\nIt was then that I noticed something peculiar - the ground was teeming with new, small plants. They were fungal-like, skinny and twisted, with thorny branches that seemed to move on their own.\n\nThe plants were unlike anything I had ever seen before. I was sure they weren’t there three days ago, so must have been growing at an unprecedented rate. I pulled my jacket hood up, and stepped outside to have a closer look. \n\nThe plants had a strange allure to them. They seemed to emit a soft glow, giving off an airy luminance that added to their mystique. The leaves were a vibrant shade of green, and the thorns were a deep, ominous black and white. The way the branches twisted and turned gave the plants an almost sentient quality, and it was as if they were moving on their own.\n\nI decided to survey the damage to the rest of the town, so I set off down the street, trudging through ankle-high water .\n\nThe large square that hosted the bustling open-air market was waterlogged and muddy, with water and debris in many areas. The stalls and merchandise that were once bustling with activity were damaged, some completely destroyed, and debris from the market was scattered throughout the square.\n\nThe small shops and cafes surrounding the market also suffered damage, with broken windows, water damage, and even a collapsed roof. The Orthodox Church and municipal building was also visibly affected, with the church's exterior showing water damage and leaks and the municipal building appearing to experience structural damage.\n\nBut it was the plants that truly worried me. They were growing everywhere. And not just the ones like at my place, but all sorts. Thick, thin, colorful, black and white, and some seemed to be glowing in the rain. This didn’t make any sense. such rapid growth was unprecedented, and these plants were unlike any I had seen before. \n\nI noticed Dmitriy in his café, moving furniture around and away from the water that had come in through his smashed front window. \n\n“Here Dmitriy, let me help” I said, walking in out of the rain.\n\nI grabbed the other end of a table he was trying to lift and helped him move it on top of another.\n\n“Thanks Alex”, he said, wiping some sweat from his brow.\n\n“How long have you been down here”, I asked as we grabbed some old chairs and lifted them up to the table top.\n\n“Too long. The water wont stop coming in. I wanted to get some sandbags from Annas farm on the other side of the Obry, but the bridge has been washed away”, he grunted.\n\nObry is the name of the river that runs around our town, and the bridge is the only way in or out.\n\n“So don’t expect any help anytime soon then huh”, I said.\n\nDmitriy just laughed.\n\nAfter a few minutes of helping move more items off the floor, I asked Dmitriy “what do you make of those”, and nodded my head toward the plants.\n\nHe looked at them, then at me. I thought I saw a genuine look of fear in his eyes. “Nothing good”, was all he said.\n\nThe rain persisted throughout the night, although it was less deafening on my roof than the previous few nights. I managed to drift off to sleep more easily, but my slumber was plagued by nightmarish visions of strange creatures and extraterrestrial beings. Whenever I tried to flee from them, I found myself slowed down by the water and the plants, which seemed to grasp at me and hold me back.\n\nSuddenly, I was jolted awake by the sound of breaking glass. \n\nMy initial thought was that it could be a looter, so I cautiously made my way downstairs to investigate. However, the reality was even more terrifying than I could have imagined. Thorny vines from the plants outside had smashed through my front window, writhing and thrashing as if searching for something. And then it dawned on me - they were searching for me! The realization sent shivers down my spine as I stood there, frozen with horror.\n\nI ran back upstairs, hastily dressed, and grabbed a few personal belongings to stuff into my backpack. I then ran back downstairs and flung open the back door. I was petrified. The plants were everywhere, and so much bigger than before I bolted out into the pouring rain, taking the side path of my house and onto the street. Every step was a challenge, as I had to dodge and leap over wriggling vines that seemed to reach out for me.\n\nI looked on in horror, as the plants had spread their tentacles throughout the entire town, bursting through walls and windows. My neighbour was standing at his front door, writhing in agony as numerous vines had penetrated his skin and were moving under his flesh. As he weakly reached out to me for aid I mouthed “I’m sorry” for there was nothing I could do.\n\nThe once-familiar streets were now unrecognizable, replaced by a dense forest of thorns, leaves, and vines that choked the very life out of the town. \n\nAs I made my way through the town, I saw people and pets being absorbed by the plants, their screams of terror ringing in my ears. It was as if the plants were alive, consuming anything and everything in their path with a sinister hunger. It was a nightmare come to life, a dystopian world where nature had turned against us.\n\nI knew I had to escape, to find a way out of this horror show before it was too late. The rain continued to pound down on me, soaking me to the bone, but I didn't care. All that mattered was getting as far away from this hellish town as possible.\n\nAs I ran, I could feel the plants getting closer and closer, as if they were hunting me down. It was a race against time, a desperate bid for survival. And then, after what felt like hours of running, I saw it - the edge of the town. The plants were thinner here, as if their power waned as they got farther from the town.\n\nHowever, I didn’t slow down until I was out of town completely. I crossed the normally docile river, now raging after all the rain, and barely made it to the other side without being washed away. I collapsed by the side of the road, gasping for breath, and only then I allowed myself to relax just a little. I had made it out alive, and for the first time in days, I was finally out of the rain. Yet over the river, I could see the rain still pouring down over the town.\n\nI was alerted by a faint rumble in the distance, causing me to turn my gaze away from the town and down the road. It was then that I noticed tanks and jeeps approaching the town, and I decided I would be best to leave before their arrival. I made a hasty retreat through the fields, embarking on a long journey to the next town.\n\nFour days have elapsed since then, and I am now in the neighboring town. However, I am faced with an unsettling discovery - my town has been wiped off the internet entirely. All online records, including maps, have been blurred or digitally erased, and no information about the town can be found.\n\nTo make matters worse, reports indicate a new storm system is brewing across Europe, and it is expected to last for weeks. I cannot shake off the feeling that my town was a mere test, used to ascertain the possibility of terraforming our planet. And now, I believe it has passed the test.",

        "text": "Some urban legends have a way of weaving themselves into communities like a sparkling accent. When I was a substantially younger man, our favorite local tale was the Grapevine Angel story. A crumbling and weathered concrete angel stood vigil in Grapevine Cemetary over the grave of someone whose name had long worn away from the porous headstone. The oldtimers in town said if you kissed your true love in front of the stone figure under the light of a full moon, the wings would flutter.\n\nMy generation wasn’t satisfied with an endearing folk tale. Most aren’t these days, so it seems. No, at some point it transformed into a grim tale of terror and revenge for anyone foolish enough to cross the angel’s path after sundown. Gone were the sweet thoughts of finding your everlasting love and an angel of vengeance came in its place. Teen angst was well in place with every generation, though I think they get a bit darker every decade or so. \n\nTwo stone hands that had once reached toward the heavens had long ago broken away. Time and erosion took them if you asked the cemetery caretaker. An angry drunk shot them off in a fit of rage if you asked anyone from my graduating class. He was found down the road, they said, eyes missing and a stone hand shoved down his throat.\n\nOf course, both stories are absolute bullshit. How do I know? Evidence. I always trust the evidence. \n\nThe first version of the tale is sweet, don’t get me wrong. Who wouldn’t love to think you could kiss your girl in the shadow of a grave marker and find out if they were the one meant for only you? I’ll admit I tried. Rose Ellis and I stood in the moonlight below that angel the summer before our senior year. Those stone wings held firm as we kissed in the darkness. We got married anyway and had a lot of happy years together until a brain aneurysm took her away far too soon.\n\nVersion two is equally false and the evidence backs that up as well. No record exists of a man being found on Sandcut Road with no eyes and a stone hand in his esophagus. I’ll guess some of you think there is that outside chance it could have happened. If you’re a local, you almost certainly think I’m wrong. I get it, but the evidence is once again on my side.\n\nYou see, I joined the Madison Police Department a few years out of high school. Night shift in a town of less than twenty thousand wasn’t exactly a thrill a minute. Sure, you’d have a couple of public intoxication arrests or the occasional break-in, but a lot of our nights were spent at the station listening to the scanner and taking a call here and there. During my first year on the job, I scanned old reports from 1960 to 1990 looking for a single file to corroborate the Grapevine Angel killing.\n\nGuess what? Not a damn thing to be found. Follow the evidence. It usually won’t let you down.\n\nUrban legends, as I said, have a way of weaving into a community. The Grapevine angel lasted generations and the tales still thrive today to my understanding. I chased my fair share of high schoolers out of that cemetery in the dead of night until I moved on to a position as a homicide detective. Beat cops would still laugh around the breakroom when someone mentioned catching a batch of kids out there.\n\nI’m not here to talk about the angel, though. Sorry if you feel misled. My thoughts wander more often than not these days. Old age and cheap alcohol drag you in odd directions. Retirement has played hell on my mental health and self-medication is all I have left.\n\nNo, I want to tell you about Old Salem Church and its stained-glass windows. Amber Bates, too. I’ll try and make sense of it all, but there’s a problem. *Evidence*. That word has defined so much of my life. I flounder without it and there is so damn little here that it has driven me mad.\n\nSometimes urban legends weave into a community like cancer. It penetrates places you cannot see and chokes the life out of everything it touches. Thick roots grow and spread before you can do anything to stop it.\n\nSometimes these legends aren’t legends at all.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nEveryone around the Madison PD knew about the disappearances in the unincorporated township of Crenshaw. It was a constant topic of conversation at the water cooler or during a third round at Duke’s Saloon. With a population danging just under a thousand, Crenshaw wasn’t much more than a dot on the map, but it drew law enforcement’s attention in a way a place that small never should.\n\nPeople vanished there frequently. At least forty-five from 1966 to 2022, ages ranging from fourteen to nineteen. Primarily teenagers from Madison and other surrounding communities. Most if not all of them were related to the dilapidated Old Salem Bible Church on Parkway #3 Road. It was little more than a skeleton with a dipping roof when I graduated too many years ago and time hadn’t been any more kind to it since.\n\nOld Salem Church was a party house for teenagers. A trust had been established to take care of it, but at some point, interest waned and it fell into ruin. Gates and fencing had been installed decades before to keep trespassers out, but the same lack of care as the building brought them to ruin. As a young beat cop, I was relieved not to have it in our jurisdiction.\n\nSeeing as we were cops over in the “big city” of Madison, none of these disappearances hit our desks. The troopers at the state police and the country sheriff’s office handled investigations in the rural areas. While Crenshaw was only fifteen minutes outside of our city limits, they made it known our assistance wouldn’t be necessary.\n\nHell, even when someone from our sleepy little town vanished there, the troopers refused to share case information. What little bit we knew came from the poorly written local paper or the liquor-loosened lips of a trooper stopping at Duke’s for a few rounds before heading home. I know I may make the state patrol sound like a cluster of assholes, but that’s how it was back then. Territorial. Cases are to a detective what a bone is to a dog: it’s yours and you don’t give it up easily or without a fight.\n\nIt turns out curiosity really does kill the cat. In the mid-nineties, the city of Madison annexed unincorporated Crenshaw causing a laughable population increase of a thousand and increasing our territory a bit farther into the rural areas. While I didn’t think much of it at first, that changed quickly when Jeanie, our file clerk, rolled a dolly of careworn cardboard boxes to my desk and dropped them with a thud.\n\n“What’s all this?” I asked with a comical eyebrow arched in her direction. “Runnin’ out of room in storage?\n\n“Cases from the state police and sheriff’s office,” she replied with a tired smile. “They’ve been coming in all day and I’m dropping them off as they arrive. Don’t worry, Henry. Only one of them is yours.”\n\nMy eyes drifted to the box she slid onto the corner of my desk. There had only been one homicide in Crenshaw in the previous three decades and it seemed unlikely there would have been more than two or three folders worth of material for that. A drunk farmer named Harold McCoy had shot a hired hand for trying to teach his daughter about the birds and bees. The case was so old that McCoy was paroled and in his grave by then. An entire box seemed a bit much just for that.\n\n“Jeanie,” I mumbled, “This can’t all be homicide cases. There are more pounds of paper here than people in Crenshaw.”\n\n“Just doing as I’m told, Detective Welborn,” she replied, tossing me a playful salute. “Lots of missing person cases transferred over and the chief said to split them up between detectives. Cold cases. *Weekend work*, he called it.”\n\nI was to object further, but before I could, a young fella was yelling for Jeanie from the file room. Another load of files, I guess. No more showed up at my desk that day and that was a small relief. My workload wasn’t exactly overflowing, but I was due to testify in court three times over the following month and had spent most of those days preparing my testimony.\n\nPulling open the box, I briefly thumbed through some of the files. The papers inside were nearly as yellowed as the folders they sat in. A rolling must of mothballs and stale air seemed to waft out. It was like opening an unused barn in the heat of summer. Overwhelming. My stomach turned at the aged aroma.\n\nThe clock on my desk told me it was nearly quitting time. While most people live for the end of the workday, it wasn’t my highlight. The house was a lonely place. Just an empty box I sat in until I went to sleep. Nothing there but me and daydreams of what life should have been like. Rose had died less than a year before, and I should have been home when it happened. Maybe I could have helped. Probably not, but those intrusive thoughts like to stay for a drink when they creep in.\n\nI’d found her on the floor in the kitchen after working a double. Her eyes were open and she just had this confused look on her face. Maybe she felt the aneurysm before it ruptured. Maybe she was trying to figure out what spice she was looking for in the open cabinet before fell. I just held her and cried for God knows how long. She felt cold, and I just wanted to warm her up.\n\nMy thumb fidgeted with the label on one of the folders.  There was nothing before me but an endless night of trash television, a microwave meal, and talking to a woman who could no longer answer me. I decided to take a look at one of the missing person cases before the chief asked. Tucking the box under my arm, I headed to the car.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nA glass of scotch in hand, I read the thirty or so pages of the first moldering case file. \n\nTrevor Bates was the sixteen-year-old son of Homer and Amelia Bates. His father worked as a brick mason and his mother was a homemaker. The young man had gone missing in the summer of 1968. His friends reported that he had last been seen at a small gathering at Old Salem Church. \n\nDuring the evening he vanished, between five and eight teenagers congregated at Old Salem Church to drink beer around a bonfire. It was noted in the file that while teenagers frequently held parties there due to the remoteness of the location, they were always held outside. The church building seemed unsafe even to youth who used the property.\n\nAccording to at least three of the witnesses, Trevor smoked marijuana for the first time that evening. No one described him as out of control, but he verbally stated he wanted to explore the inside of the church. The others attempted to talk him out of entering the dangerous building, but he insisted he need to go inside.\n\nAn unidentified young woman told the investigators that Trevor confided in her that someone from school told him that if he went into the church under the light of the full moon, the stained glass windows in the chapel would show him five scenes from his past and one from your future. She showed him that all of the windows had been broken, but Trevor insisted that he needed to go inside.\n\nWhile the remainder of the group sat at a bonfire sipping beer, Trevor slipped away and entered the church. Fearful that the structure was unstable, the other teenagers called his name from outside but received no answer. Two of the young men retrieved flashlights from their vehicles and shined them into the broken windows but saw no sign of their friend.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bates reported him missing the following morning to the county sheriff’s office. A call had been made by an unidentified source that morning providing the names of others in attendance. They were questioned and released to their parents, having provided no useful information as to Trevor’s whereabouts. His pickup truck was discovered parked behind a treeline on the Old Salem Church property. A sweep of the building produced no additional evidence.\n\nAt the bottom of the final page were scribbled four strange words.\n\n*Windows are all unbroken.*\n\nIt was an odd remark to add as it contradicted the earlier statement when the young woman reported showing Trevor the broken windows. I picked at the thread with my mind but moved on when I found no solid grasp. Still, it nagged at my mind like food caught between your teeth.\n\nNo one ever saw or spoke with Trevor again.\n\nThe case was unremarkable yet. It was the sixties; the age of free love, cheap dope, and aimless youth. It wasn’t unheard of in those days for some bored farm kid to hop in an old Volkswagen van with a crew of perfect strangers and go to find “enlightenment” on the coast. A load of drunk, stoned teenagers saying he vanished in an old church was difficult to believe.\n\nBut the kid had still gone missing. Him and over twenty more. No contact. No evidence. No bodies. Just vanished like smoke on the breeze.\n\nWhile I had intended only to read the first file, I found myself sitting at the kitchen table as the sun crawled over the horizon. I’d gone through all of the cases that night and into the next morning. Sometimes a kid vanished at a party. Other times someone would disappear randomly. Days later, a friend would tell the missing child’s parents or a trooper that they were headed to Old Salem Church to see their future.\n\nThere was the occasional mention of increased patrol activity in the area. Troopers and deputies made regular checks of the place, but it was hard to keep it covered. Area funding was thin and there was barely enough coverage for the rural areas in those days. Even on the occasions a trooper happened upon a kegger at the old church, the kids would scatter to the wind before a cruiser could make it down the rutted gravel drive.\n\nAfter a disappearance, patrols would increase. But we’ve got short memories. After a tearful mother leaves the news cycle, patrols tend to be redirected to higher-population areas. It’s almost like we never learn a damn lesson.\n\nEvery disappearance led back to those damn stained glass windows. I had chuckled the first two or three times. It reminded me of the Grapevine Angel of my youth. These kids flocked to the church for the same reason I had taken Rose to the cemetery for that long-ago kiss. A possible glimpse at the future.\n\nSilly as the urban legend was to me, I had read case after case of teenagers going missing from the same place over the course of decades. Grieving parents and siblings would occasionally call our department after we annexed the township. Some of the people had been missing for two decades, but you could hear the ripe grief in their voices.\n\nI read every damn one of those case files from cover to cover at least a dozen times in the small hours of the night. Making notes on similarities, spitballing a profile for a serial killer I doubted even existed. The frustration of the drunken troopers at Duke’s made sense. There was just no damned evidence in those files.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nI had intended to go to work the following day, but I knew I’d never be able to concentrate on my work. With my best impersonation of a flu-tinged voice, I called dispatch to inform them I wouldn’t be coming in. Instead, I slid behind the wheel of my truck and drove toward Crenshaw.\n\nParkway #3 Road was only a road by virtue of its name. In reality, it was no more than a rutted gravel drag scabbed with high patches of grass. My old pickup rumbled roughly in the dips and over the sudden rises. The weathered steeple of Old Salem Church bobbed over the treeline ahead of me like a crooked vulture neck waiting for its next meal to die.\n\nA chill ran down my spine as creeping fear surged through my body. I knew I should have turned the truck around, but my foot deadened on the gas and continued to push me forward.\n\nAs I pulled around the line of trees blocking it from my view, the full church came into vision. Perched on a squat hill, the grayed wooden building looked as though it may collapse at any moment. Bright shards of colored glass bordered the window frame looking like a rainbow of incisors. It had looked that way for decades. Once a place of worship, it became no more than a flophouse for drunk kids.\n\nSitting just at the bottom of the hill on the hood of a battered blue Ford Taurus sat a young woman.\n\nI put the truck into park a few yards from the unexpected visitor, I jumped out and walked toward her.\n\n“How you doin’ today, ma’am?” I asked in the friendliest voice I could muster. Finding someone there in the middle of the day hadn’t occurred to me and her presence made me feel uneasy. She had long brown hair that framed a mischievously pretty face. Smoke drifted around her in the lazy afternoon breeze. She looked a bit like Rose and it made my heart ache.\n\n“You the cop?” she asked, and I froze.\n\n“Pardon me?”\n\nShe slid down from the hood of her car and walked in my direction. We made eye contact and the intensity of her gaze nearly made me look away. It felt like she was looking into my soul. Almost as if she knew something about me that I didn’t know about myself.\n\n“I asked if you are the cop,” she replied in a soft but serious tone. “I didn’t think you’d show.”\n\n“Why would you expect to meet me here?” I asked. “I don’t know you.”\n\n“I don’t know you, either,” she said with a smirk. “But here we are.”\n\n“I’m Detective Henry Welborn with Madison PD,” I said, slipping my badge from my back pocket. She looked at it with the intensity of a trained killer. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Italy Sky,” she responded hesitantly.\n\n“That sounds… unlikely,” I said. The young woman shrugged and looked toward the ground. “Mind showing me some identification?” \n\n“I don’t have to show you my ID,” she spat. “Haven’t done anything illegal.”\n\n“No one said you did,” I responded. “Just like to know who I’m talking to.”\n\nShe fumbled a hand into her back pocket and extended a laminated card in my direction. I took it gingerly from her hand and looked it over. *Amber Bates* filled the name line on the card next to a picture of her with the same captivating smirk.\n\n“Look,” she said. “I didn’t lie. My parents named me Italy when I was born, but changed it a few months later. But I like it. It’s unique. And it keeps people from asking me about my uncle.”\n\n“Who is your…” I began, but the words died off before I could finish the sentence. \n\nHer uncle was Trevor [Bates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ao87e/whats_so_weird_about_a_dead_body_an_invitation/",

Inside, I slammed the locks shut and backed out of my driveway in haste. As I pulled out of my street and got into traffic, I realized how tired I still was; even a surge of adrenaline could at best hold my focus for a few minutes, and at worst just guide me into an infinite amount of possible traffic accidents. I had to focus, keep my movements stable.\n\nThe sun beat down through the windshield, beckoning me to relax and take a break - open up a cold one and sit under the shade of a tree. In its simplicity, that was my favorite summertime activity. My mind devoured and guzzled any piquant thought that gave relief to the distress overstaying its welcome, and the fantasy of cold beer and soothing shade refused to unstick itself from my mind for the rest of the drive.\n\nI found a motel near one of the main roads and pulled in, my eyelids begging for release. A few times during the drive, exhaustion forced me to drift off and I swerved slightly into oncoming traffic, a few cars giving me aggressive honks and stern looks. The close calls barely registered as anything more than a pinprick that reminded me to stay awake. If I wanted to drive further, I needed to recharge. \n\nAfter I parked my car, I put the bat inside the bag, so only one end jutted out. Inconspicuous enough for a motel, I thought. I scanned the parking lot, realizing that I didn’t even know what I was looking for, and headed for the main office. \n\nI tried my best to seem normal to the clerk behind the counter. My efforts were positively in vain, as the elderly woman barely looked up, instead flicking her phone with her right index finger while holding the brick in the opposite hand, completely mesmerized by whatever comment section she was scrolling through. I asked for a single room with a bed. By the looks of it, the motel didn’t have many visitors, so she just blindly picked up one of the many keycards and handed it to me. As I handed her a wad of bills, I told her to keep the change, and I’m not sure she would’ve offered any either way. I exited the office and headed to the far end of the building, towards my unit.\n\nThe click of the lock brought on a delicious appetite for sleep. I laid the wooden bat next to myself on the double bed, and near instantly we fell asleep, clutching each other like a fresh couple during an early sleepover.\n\nI dreamed of Jacob. He was alive, but his face was still disintegrated, blood clots hanging from his chin, his tongue sticking out between drooping pieces of flesh. He laughed, which came out as a gurgle, followed by moist splatting as the air moved the flaps of flesh and blood near where his mouth used to be. Jacob took out his phone and started to take selfies, posing half-ironically, trying to make faces with whatever face he had left. He chortled and twisted his body in fresh poses as the flash of his phone went off ever more rapidly. He beckoned me to join him.\n\nI woke up to knocking on my door - the dream instantly wiped and another dose of adrenaline packing my blood vessels tight, folding my focus back into the real world. My muscles ached, and thirst and hunger immediately reminded me of their existence.\n\n“Who’s there?” I croaked through dry lips, right as it occurred to me that keeping quiet would’ve been the smart thing to do.\n\nA steady voice rifled with a fluctuating southern accent replied “It’s Matthew Irving. I mean no harm. I’m here to help, if you were to believe it.” \n\nI swallowed to clear my throat, and replied with a tinge more confidence in my voice “Are you with them? Are you with the cops?”\n\n“No sir, neither.“ the man responded, “But I got the emails as well. The instructions, y’know. I used the website and all, and if you’d like my help, I’d consider letting me in.”\n\nObviously he wasn’t with the cops, so either he was here to kill me, or to help me.\n\n“You got a gun on you or anything?” I asked him.\n\n“No sir.” he sighed, seemingly annoyed at my pestering.\n\nI pre-dialed 911 on my phone and slid it into my back pocket, unlocked. I approached the door with the baseball bat carving tiny splinters into the palm of my hand.\n\nI let the man in, and immediately after he closed the door I instructed him to stand with his arms to his sides so I could search him. He wore bright blue jeans so tight it’d be hard to conceal a weapon inside them, but I went through the motions just in case. His torso held a bedazzled country shirt tucked neatly into his pants, separated by a brown leather belt with a huge, faded metal buckle boasting bulls and lasso ropes. On his feet he had riding boots that seemed to chip at the floor every time he took a step. If he’d smelled like cow-shit or had a stetson on his sweaty head, the man would’ve seemed like a caricature of the freedom-laced Texan cowboy.\n\nI rifled through his getup with one hand, as I clutched my bat in the other. The cowboy was calm throughout the procedure and stood still. After I was satisfied that he didn’t have any weapons on him, I ordered him to sit in one of the chairs, and told him that I have 911 pre-dialed on my phone, and I’m not afraid to pummel his face in either if it came to that. As he nodded and reassured me of his goodwill, Jacob’s face flashed back into my mind. \n\n*His parent’s are going to need to identify his body. They need to look into the pit that used to be their son’s face and say “Yes. That is my son. That horrible, twisted, mangled piece of flesh and blood is - was - my very own Jacob.” Maybe they had done this already. Maybe now they’re preparing for his funeral.*\n\nI stumbled back into conscious reality and saw the cowboy staring at me, waiting. \n\n“How do you know about the emails and the website?” I asked him.\n\nSeemingly eager to give his piece, he replied “Well, I got the link to the website as well. What’s so weird about a dead body, that one. I got the when and where to my friend Rob’s house five years ago. When I went there, his guts were spilled on the floor. Part of his ribcage showed through long stretches of intestinal carnage. It looked like Pollock took a stab at being a butcher.”\n\nAfter a few seconds, the cowboy laughed heartily through a big smile and continued “So who was it for you? A friend, a brother, perhaps an old lover? How did you find them?”\n\nNot sharing the trusting honesty he seemed to have for me, but wanting to seem compliant, I replied as simply as I could. “Jacob. He was a friend. His face had caved in. That’s how I found him. But I didn’t do it, ask the cops.”\n\n“You *sure* it wasn’t you?” the man asked, grinning, pointing at my bat, “And if it wasn’t you, then why the hell’re you sleeping with a baseball bat at a motel?”\n\n“How the fuck did you even find me? Did you follow me from my house?” I replied in attempted intimidation, as I realized that I’d told no one that I’m here. \n\n“Listen,” the man said, leaning forward with his elbows to his knees, the balls of his feet balancing the thinking man’s stretch. “I get it. I went through it too, and there are others as well. We actually have a support group, believe it or not. Yeah, the Morbid Angels - dumb name, I know. But you know how it is, being a fan of the macabre brings its share of theatricality. We meet at the rec center on Fridays, so if you’d like, you can come by tomorrow. We can talk more then. We’d love to have you.”\n\nThe man got up slowly, holding his hands up halfway in a casual gesture of surrender “As for how I found you, well one of the guys in M.A is a cop. He caught wind of your case and put two and two together. It wasn’t that hard to track your whereabouts from there.”\n\nLeisurely, the cowboy walked out the door, closing it behind him. As he started to walk away, he shouted “See you tomorrow night!”\n\nFlustered and confused, I sat back down on the bed. I let go of the bat, the knuckles of my hand white and my palm scattered with tiny specks of wood. Pain joined hunger and thirst in their incessant reminder of their actuality.\n\nIf he wanted me dead, why would he come and do this song and dance? I pondered the situation for a while, finding no answer completely fitting. The rec center isn’t far off, and it’s a public space, so going there doesn’t pose a huge risk - and unfortunately, that’s the only lead I have right now. Before all that I’ll need to reply to my body and get some food and water, though, and try to get some more sleep in. I’ll reassess tomorrow.",

        "text": "Before we moved in, I couldn't wait to enjoy my new upstairs bedroom - especially coming from a small mobile home. The 4 bedroom house was a huge upgrade.\n\n\nPlus, my new bedroom had a spacious walk-in closet... The closet was the size of a large bathroom or small hallway but the house itself had an A-frame. So when you walked into the closet, after about 6 feet, there was a little nook/crawlspace, and as you walked back out, to the right was an inclined platform that led straight up to a small door into the attic. \n\n\nWhen my mom told me about the closet and crawlspace, I was really excited to have such a big closet to myself. As 6-year olds do, I fantasized about making a secret hideout, stuffed animal landslides, and sliding down the incline like I was in a playground.\n\n\nThose fantasies came to a halt when I stood in front of the closet for the first time. Something felt off about that closet. Something felt off about that whole house. It always felt like someone was watching me, like I was never alone. An overwhelming sense of discomfort coursed through my veins, and when I walked into the house, the air felt thick and suffocating. It just felt wrong. it felt unsafe. \n\n\nIf I needed to get something from the closet, I would open the door with my head turned in the opposite direction and I’d turn the light on by pulling on the rusted chain with my eyes tightly shut. I remember the sound of the chain grinding against the light fixture before the light switched on. \n\n\nI was afraid of my closet during the day - and I NEVER went into my closet at night. And I never forgot to lock the closet door before going to bed. When you touched the doorknob, it made kind of a rattling sound like something was loose inside, or the doorknob itself was just worn down. \n\n\nBut I want to stop for a second on this train of thought, because what is the purpose of having a lock on a closet door? Seriously, why would someone install a lock on a closet door? To keep people from going in? No. That can’t be right because it was a push lock. So if you turn the knob from the outside, it unlocks the door. You don’t need a special key. It just didn't make sense. But I didn't think twice about the reason for the lock at the time. I just had a gut feeling that the door should remain locked.\n\n\nAt 2:30 in the morning, I heard a noise coming from my closet. Something was scratching against the closet door. I froze. I heard the scratching again.\n\n\nI covered my head with the covers and laid staring at the door, terrified of what I was hearing. I thought to myself “Ariel, it’s just a dream. You’re dreaming. It’s just a dream. It’s just a dream. None of this is happening.” But I didn’t dare to speak or even whisper. I was completely frozen in fear.\n\n\nI laid in bed, dead silent, waiting for the scratching to stop. I kept trying to remind myself that it wasn’t real. It wasn’t real. IT’S NOT REAL. The scratching finally stopped.\n\n\nThen the doorknob slowly started to turn. Luckily, the door was locked. But the turning of the knob started getting aggressive. Something was not happy to be locked out of the room - just pushing into the door, forcing the doorknob to turn, trying to break in.\n\n\nAt that point I hid all the way under my covers, staring at the sheet covering my head, this thin layer of protection keeping me safe.\n\n\nI heard a click, and the noise stopped. But then I heard a creaking sound as the closet door opened.\n\n\nI heard footsteps approaching my bed. And I screamed. \n\n\nThe covers lifted and it was my mom. She came to check on me because she heard banging upstairs. I told her what happened. \n\n\nShe didn’t believe me at the time because this was the first encounter in the house. \n\n\nBut my closet door was open. \n\n\nShe told me it was just a nightmare. Nobody was there. It wasn’t a nightmare. She closed the closet door and locked it before going back to her room.\n\n\nAfter that night, I realized that the lock wasn’t meant to keep people from going in. It was meant to keep something from getting out.\n\n\nI wasn’t the only family member who experienced strange things in the house. \n\n\nMy mom was woken by her grandmother in the middle of the night. She told my mom to follow her into the living room because she didn’t want to wake my dad. \n\n\nMy mom followed her to the couch, where they sat together and she told my mom to pray for her. That she was in purgatory, and the clock was ticking. The clock in the living room was ticking loudly. She repeated that she was in purgatory. The clock continued to tick. And then it just stopped. My mom woke up the next morning on the couch. The clock was stopped at 2:30AM. Her grandmother had died exactly one year to the day. \n\n\nThese weren’t the only strange happenings in that house, and I still have nightmares. I wake up 25 years in the past. I look toward the closet, and the door swings open. There’s a thin, bald man, crouching in the nook of the closet. He looks at me with bright white-yellow eyes, smiles, and charges toward me. I wake before he reaches me.\n\n\nI don’t really believe in ghosts and the paranormal, and the house has since been renovated and purchased. But I have no doubt that while we were living there, we weren’t the only ones in residence.",

        "text": "So recently, I finally caved and bought an Alexa. Look, I know there are lots of you out there who preach about how the device is just a way for the government to spy on you, and to be honest, I really don't care. I just thought having a device to ask stupid questions to would be kinda cool. \n\nAnyway, I was so excited to finally get my Alexa up and running. I plugged it in and quickly got to work with setting up features and testing out voice commands. I set it up in my room for ease of access concerning things like asking for the weather or determining how long my commute would take. It didn't take long for me to fall into a routine where I would wake up, ask it a few questions, and head out to start my day. I grew accustomed to the robotic female voice and the green ring that signified a notification on my Alexa. I even started using more of the features. Whispering to the device would cause it to whisper back, which was great for not getting blasted with a loud voice after a hard day's work. I also set up a smart light to be able to turn on a lamp by just asking Alexa to do it. It's by no means a stretch to say that I was content with my purchase. \n\nBut starting about two weeks ago, my device has been acting *strange*. Things started off pretty normal. Sometimes, I would be awoken by a soft static sound  in the middle of the night. Hell, the first time I heard it, it took me a good 15 minutes to realize it was coming from my Alexa. I figured it was just some kind of software malfunction.\n\n\"Alexa, stop.\"\n\nAnd back to my slumber, I went. But Alexa was far from finished with me. Every night, Alexa would wake me up at a random time with this incessant static.\n\n\"Alexa, stop.\" \n\nEach time, my command was thankfully obeyed. I tried looking up solutions on Google or tech forums on what to do. Resetting my Alexa yielded no solution to the problem. In fact, every night, the static seemed to get louder, despite me not changing the volume setting for the device. \n\n\"Alexa, I said *stop*.\"\n\nIt was getting harder and harder to sleep, so I finally decided to just pull the plug and disconnect the damn thing. It was helpful, sure, but not worth getting startled awake by a loud noise every night. It had been two weeks of this crap and I thought to myself, \"Finally, I can get some sleep tonight!\" \n\nImagine my surprise when the damn thing blasted static louder than it had ever before.\n\n\"ALEXA, STO-\" \n\nThen the screaming started. This deep guttural scream was emanating from my Alexa device. It was so loud I could barely hear myself think. How the fuck was this device even working? I swore I unplugged it just a few hours ago. The unsettling screams from the device made me cautiously approach the wall outlet. Surely I had made a mistake and forgot to unplug the thing, right? \n\nMy heart sank. The device *was* unplugged. Goosebumps ran down my arms as my brain searched for a reason why this thing was still on. The screams weren't stopping. Every second that passed, I felt more and more vulnerable. Like at any moment, something would pounce on me from the darkness of my room. My body was yelling at me to just destroy this thing. Who cares how much it was? I complied with my instincts and smashed the Alexa to bits on my floor. Finally, the screaming had stopped. My shaking hands picked up the now jagged remnants of my Alexa and disposed of them in my garbage. I returned to bed and admittedly had a hard time falling asleep. This eerie feeling was lingering on my spine. Nevertheless, I fell asleep. \n\nI woke to the *ding* of an Alexa notification. Immediately, my eyes darted to the dresser I had kept it on, and there it was. Fully intact and fully functional. What the fuck? Was this a dream? It had to be. I destroyed this thing just last night, how could it be right back to where it was? Unfortunately, I had no time to think. As if the device had noticed I was awake, the screaming resumed. The same feelings of fear lept right back into my body. Every time I destroyed the thing, it would pop right back where I had originally placed it. Screaming. Over, and over, and over. \n\nI came to the realization today that the sounds of those screams weren't just random. Those deep and unsettling sounds rippled through my bones every second of the day that I spent at my house. I had done my best to ignore them, not give them any thought. I always watched my back at home and barely slept at all at night. That's because these screams were *mine*. My voice was being distorted in ways I didn't think imaginable. Why was it using my voice? I mean, I've never even screamed like that. It couldn't be me for real, could it?  I didn't know what to do... I DONT know what to do. As I type this, the screaming still won't stop. It's gnawing at my mind.  Shadows dance in my room, weird noises intertwine with the screams. I can't separate reality from the noise that's resonating in my ears. It feels like things are crawling inside of me. I just want it to \"**STOP**.\"\n\nThat green notification light just appeared around Alexa. God, she finally stopped screaming. \n\nSuddenly, there's a knock at my bedroom door.\n\nI live alone.",

        "text": "Teddy died when we were kids.\n\nIt wasn’t the sunniest of days, but it wasn’t the cloudiest. What rain there was washed into the creek, and the winds, strong as they were, did little to keep anyone inside. That was the way in Murkwood back then. Reckless, careless, thoughtless little children running amok around town while the threat of tornado sirens played more like a ring for a treat given upon arriving at a stranger’s doorstep.\n\nThat storm came and went a week before Halloween. When it fizzled out with the static crackling of distant thunder, Teddy and I found ourselves at the edge of town, between the Casper caves and the Murkwood lookout. It was clear someone, some people, had been hanging around the tower, maybe even in the lookout itself.\n\nTeddy said we should have left, pointing out the empty beer bottles and discarded cigarettes littered about, but he didn’t notice the unlocked door at the back of the lookout. It crept open ever the slightest and begged me to come in. No, I was never one to be afraid of the dark, but Teddy was another story. He begged us to go back to my house, but instead I went into the tower, telling my friend I would just be a second, promising him we'd play video games afterward and call his mom and dad at their Vegas hotel.\n\nThat was a long second.\n\nThose stairs went on and on, and when I made it to the top, the sun had already begun to dip over the horizon. “Teddy!” I yelled, leaning over the railing and looking down. “Look at me!”\n\nThere was no response. I yelled again, scanning the field below. No one. If the way up took days, the way down went by in a flash. I raced down the steps, at times nearly tripping and tumbling down. At the landing, I lunged at the door. It didn’t budge. I rammed it with my shoulder. It barely reacted. I kicked at it over and over. It laughed back with metallic clangs.\n\nI slumped over and leaned into the steel, panting and struggling to catch my breath, when I heard it.\n\n“Daniel,” the voice said. It came from the outside as if inches from my face, separated only by the coldness pressing into my cheek. Except Teddy didn’t have a growl in his voice.\n\n“Teddy!” I yelled, pounding on the door. It busted open, finally, and I found myself on my back and staring up at where I had stood atop the tower. \n\nThat’s when I saw it. \n\nStanding with its elbows propped on the rails. Looking down at me with dark eyes. Whistling some familiar yet foreign tune. “Daniel!” it screamed into the forest. The grating voice echoed into the woods and flushed out flocks of crows in every direction. And then the sun finished setting, and I lay there in the darkness, only realizing after too many moments that I couldn’t move. I could still feel my limbs, yes, but they were just laying there, teasing me. I was there all night, screaming for help, screaming for Teddy, screaming for anyone. Mom, dad, teachers. All the while, the shadow just stared on, only this time humming so eerily that I wished my ears were like my legs.\n\nI awoke to the sight of my mom frantically pacing back and forth while my dad sat on a nearby stump, face buried in his hands and hands trembling as if it was half as cold as it really was. It was cold, yes, but Teddy had insisted I wear two layers. It was the only thing he said that I had listened to.\n\n“Daniel!” my mom screamed, rushing to my side to grab whatever she could of me. A deputy held her back, saying it was risky to move me until the ambulance arrived.\n\n“Do you remember anything about last night?” the deputy asked me.\n\nI thought back to what had happened. The storm. The tower. The door. The … figure. “Teddy!” I shouted. “Where’s Teddy?”\n\n“Son …”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\nNo one answered. Instead, they stared off into space and then up at the top of the lookout.\n\t“What’s up there? Why is everyone looking up there?”\n\n“He’s gone,” my dad said. “Teddy’s gone.”\n\n“Where did he go?”\n\n“Honey,” my mom said, caressing my face and wiping tears from my eyes. “I don’t know how else to tell you this, but—”\n\n“He’s dead, isn’t he?”\n\n“Daniel.”\n\n“He’s dead, and it’s all my fault.”\n\nThe deputy stood over me, notebook and pencil in his hands. “What do you mean your fault?”\n\nMy dad looked over. “Not another word, Daniel. Not until Mr. Johnson gets here.”\n\n“What happened to Teddy?” I asked.\n\n“You should get seen first,” my mom suggested. “Can you feel your legs?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can you move them?”\n\n“No, but they burn.”\n\n“At least you can feel them.”\n\n“I’m scared.”\n\n“It’s okay, honey. The paramedics are on their way. Mommy and daddy are here. The sheriff will be here, too, and Mr. Johnson.”\n\nI learned later that Teddy's body was found at the top of the tower. My mom didn't let me see photos of it, and I only finally saw them last week.\n\n---\n\n\"So that's why you're here, Daniel?\" The therapist shifts in her seat and leans in, pen and paper in hand. \"You never talked about Teddy to anyone. You never talked to anyone about anything.”\n\n“Shrinks aren’t my thing,” I say, “but you’re all right.”\n\n“Thanks, Daniel.”\n\n“I didn’t talk to anyone about it, but I wrote.”\n\n“A journal.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you have that journal here with you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’d like to explore all of this more with you.”\n\n“I’m sure you do.”\n\nShe grabs a notebook from the table between us and begins to write. “Just crossing some personal things out of my schedule,” she says before setting the notebook back down. “There. Now, I do have to ask. You haven’t talked about this in what, thirty years?”\n\n“About.”\n\n“So, what changed? Seeing the photos?”\n\n“No.”\n\nShe nods and scribbles into her notepad. Pausing, she looks me dead in the eye and says, “It’s perfectly normal for adults to not address trauma for that length of time. I’m glad you came in today.” She continues to nod.\n\nIt takes a good few moments, but she stops bobbing her head, and I start talking. “What changed?”\n\n“Yes, what changed?”\n\n“Last week, I was unpacking the rest of my stuff and had the news on. There was this fundraiser event for the school, and the camera feed froze and nothing was moving, but, but one of the kids backed up to the camera, turned around, and stared.\"\n\n\"I heard there was a blackout at the station.\"\n\n\"No, it was still live. I felt it staring at me, so I moved across the room, and its eyes followed me. I went to the side of the TV, slightly behind it, and it still turned in my direction. I swear I'm not crazy.\"\n\n\"I don't think you are.\"\n\n\"And then I noticed that he had curly, brown hair and green eyes and that he was wearing a Led Zeppelin shirt. It was Teddy.\"\n\nThe shrink stops jotting down notes into her book. She uncrosses her legs and sits forward. With furrowed brows, she asks, \"Are you sure you saw Teddy?\"\n\n\"It was him.\"\n\nShe walks to the door and unlocks it. \"Mr. Gallowirz, you need to listen to me and listen very carefully. You need to get as far from here as possible. That was not Teddy.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You're not the first to see the shadow, but you are the first to see the shadow *again*.\"\n\n\"The shadow? That thing on the tower? That thing killed Teddy?\"\n\n\"That thing didn't kill Teddy.\"\n\n\"Then what did?\"\n\n\"Try to remember, Daniel. You have to remember.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" I stumble backward and trip back onto an ottoman. The shrink chases me and catches herself on the arm of the couch.\n\n\"Was there anyone else on the TV?\" You said it was frozen? Who else was there?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It was the fundraiser for the school. Probably teachers or board members. Yeah, the board was being interviewed, and the mayor.\"\n\nThe shrink walks back to the door, leans back on the metal, and slowly closes it. \"The … mayor?\"\n\n\"He was standing in the back.\"\n\nShe takes shallow breaths and stares through me. \"You saw the shadow and Mayor Johnson on the TV? In the same frame?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'd know him anywhere. He used to be my dad's lawyer, and he came over for dinner all the time. We lost touch, especially after I moved to California, and then life got really busy, and now I'm here again after all these years because my mom is sick.\"\n\nShe scurries back to her notebook and flips through the pages. \"Mr. Johnson?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Mr. Johnson is Mayor Johnson.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Daniel, that couldn't have been him.\"\n\n\"I, no, no, it was. It was him.\"\n\nShe sits hack down. \"The mayor died three weeks ago.\"\n\n---",

        "text": "The car slowly shook, making a grinding noise akin to an jet engine taking off. Still nothing. I sighed and threw myself back against the seat. *Just my luck*, I thought, *my first taste of real freedom, and my wings are clipped less than a day in*. I had begged my parents for months to let me drive over to Coimbatore, barely 8 hours away from home, to visit some old friends. But now I was stuck in the middle of nowhere in the hills, and my phone didn't even have reception.\n\nI realised have to get out and walk to find some habitation for help. I didn't relish the prospect of leaving my comfortable car and going outside, where the chilly, howling wind carried with it a light drizzle, enough to chill one to the bone. But I'd have to go soon; else the mist would set in, making it difficult for me to retrace my steps. Even though it was only 8 pm, the narrow hill road was deserted. Just my luck when taking a shortcut off the National Highway. *Maybe I could sleep in the car...*\n\nAs I was thinking, I saw a glow of light coming up the road. The glow was unsteady and rocked from side-to-side. Within a minute, I could clearly see the source. It was a wooden cart drawn by a huge buffalo, which was leisurely coming up the hill. Upon the cart was a potbellied middle-aged man with a magnificent moustache, and a young boy. Both of them were dressed in traditional clothes, expect for a beanie on their heads. As the vehicle drew closer, I could see them more clearly. They seemed dejected, for some reason. Well, I wasn't going to question it. I got out of my car and waved them down. The boy nudged his father, who started and hit the buffalo with a light wooden switch while shouting something, and the buffalo happily came to a halt.\n\n\"Ay, what happened?\" the man asked in a sort of Malayalam garnished with Tamil, the typical dialect of the Western Ghats.\n\n\"My car broke down... I was wondering if there is any mechanic nearby,\" I replied.\n\nHearing this, the man and the boy suddenly seemed to light up. The boy pulled on the man's lungi and excitedly said something, and the man nodded, pushing him aside and leaning toward me.\n\n\"Here there won't be any mechanics. You'll have to go to Kumily town, and that's 20 kilometers away. Now it's too late to travel. I'll tell you what we can do. Leave your car here, and come with us, our village is close by. You stay overnight with us, and tomorrow morning I'll take you to Kumily; I go there every day to sell my goods in the market, anyway.\"\n\nI weighed my options. The people seemed friendly enough, and the man had a son. Family men are not likely to be criminals. I shrugged and took my backpack from the car, and they helped me onto their cart.  I quickly took a photo of my car, so that I would remember where it was the next day.\n\n\"Hey, will there be signal there?\" I asked.\n\n\"Signal?\" the man asked, puzzled by the English word.\n\nI waved my phone in front of him, and he laughed.\n\n\"Ah, you're asking if your phone works!\" he said cheerily. \"No, it wont. Government never bothered setting up those metal towers here. But it's okay, because we never really asked for them. After electric lights, we didn't need any more innovations. Who needs phones, internet and all? Causes more problems than it fixes.\" So saying, he leaned contentedly on some sacks.\n\n\"So you don't contact the outside world at all?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, we have one payphone in the village. In case of any emergency where we need outside help. But we've never had to use it. See, our village is small. Maybe 30 families. But we are all one big family. We help each other when in need, and each family does a different thing. My family's job is to go sell our crops and buy supplies when we need them. Because of this, we are also the village heads, and I'm the current headman. Since you're from the city, you won't understand this community sense.\"\n\n\"So other than you, no one goes out of the village?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" he said, beaming. \"Or more accurately, they neither need to, or want to. We're content with our way of life.\"\n\nI leaned on the wooden railing of the cart. So I'd have to spend the night in a place with no chance of signal, with a bunch of loons who hadn't progressed past the 19th century, and were in all likely heavily inbred. I sighed.\n\n\"What did you say your names were?\" I asked wearily.\n\n\"I'm Venkatayya,\" said the man, \"and this is my son Beerappa.\"\n\n*Even their names haven't moved on from the 19th century*, I idly thought.\n\n\"I'm Ajith,\" I introduced myself, \"thanks so much for picking me up.\"\n\n\"No problem, it's our duty to help everyone in need.\" said Venkatayya.\n\n\"Actually, you came at an auspicious time,\" he continued, \"our festival is happening!\"\n\n\"Your festival?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes. Every year, we have a week-long festival in honour of Ekantapayyan, our village's protector deity. Tomorrow is actually the last day, so you're just in time.\"\n\n\"Ekantapayyan?\" I asked. It meant 'lonely boy', which was a strange name for a deity.\n\n\"I'll tell you his story. In the distant past, many generations back, there was a hunter and his son. Each day they would go into the deep forest, and each night they would come back. On some days they would catch a rabbit, or a deer, and on those days the son would be happy and safe. However, on some days they would return empty-handed, and on those days his father would beat him. The hunter was a man like the wind, letting his emotions flow freely over him. When he was  happy, he would pamper his son and play with him. But when he was angry, he would hurl the worst abuses on his son and beat him till he was bruised all over.\n\n\"The son wanted to prove himself to his father, and so he began to take greater and greater risks. Consequently, the number of days where they went hungry were lesser, but the hunter's rage was greater on the days when they were empty-handed. One day, the son fell off a tree while trying to shoot a deer and broke his leg. His father went mad with rage and beat him more than he ever had, until the poor son lay limp. It was now too late; the hunter was childless. He went mad with rage, and his spirit still roams the woods today.\"\n\n\"So why do you worship him?\" I ventured to ask.\n\n\"It's less of worship as you think of it, and more of propitation. I told you how we in the village are one big family. The hunter's spirit would be our grandfather. Now we have to take care of our grandfather, regardless of what he has done. In return, in his own way, he takes care of us too.\"\n\nThere was a stillness as Venkatayya finished speaking, broken only by the clop of the hooves of  the buffalo.\n\nSuddenly Beerappa spoke, for the first time since I joined them, \"Look! We're almost there!\"\n\nThrough the forest canopy, I could see a warm glow of electric lights. Venkatayya steered the buffalo onto a dirt track leading into the forest. Travelling for almost 10 minutes through the dense trees, we came into a large clearing, from which small lanes led off into rows of tiled houses.\n\nEven though a festival was supposed to be happening, the place wasn't very lively. A few youths were sitting on a bench at one corner and talking, while an old woman was leading a goat by a rope. Beerappa quickly dismounted and started calling out in a language I couldn't understand.\n\n\"What is he saying?\" I asked.\n\n\"He's talking in our village's language. Being away from others for so many years, we developed our own language others can't understand. He's telling everyone to come out here for the festival.\"\n\nThat didn't sound right. During festivals most places would have decorations up, and celebrations from the morning well into the night.\n\n\"I thought the festival was going on? Why is it so empty?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh yes, yes,\" said Venkatayya, \"but they wouldn't start till I came. As I said, we're all a big family, and I have been in Kumily for the past three days.\"\n\nThat didn't sound right, but I didn't want to prod for fear of offending him. By now, a crowd had gathered and were looking up at us in the cart. Venkatayya raised his hands and said something in their language, and they all began to cheer and dance. Someone brought drums, and they began to beat them heartily.\n\n\"Now come,\" Venkatayya said as he dismounted, \"I'll take you to my home. You must want to freshen up and change.\"\n\nI followed him along the lanes till we reached a house a bit bigger than the rest. He climbed up the stairs to the verandah and into the house, and I did the same. He called out and a woman wearing a skirt and blouse came out from one of the rooms. He started speaking to her in his language. She seemed frightened, and started to say something while glancing at me, but Venkatayya cut her off, and she glumly nodded.\n\nHe turned to me and said, \"My wife, Juhiamma. She doesn't know Malayalam or Tamil, but I've told her to take care of you. Now I have some matters to tend to, so I'll join you in a bit.\" So saying, he left the house.\n\nJuhiamma turned to me and bowed slightly, then gestured to a room. I entered and put my bag on the bed. She made a sound to draw my attention, then led me to a small shed behind the house, which I realised was the bathroom. Like many rural areas, here, too, bathrooms were kept away from the house. I nodded and thanked her, but as I turned away the caught my hand.\n\nHer eyes were fearful, and she started speaking slowly. Yet I could not make head or tail of what she was saying; I knew both Malayalam and Tamil, and their language seemed to be related to neither. I slowly shook my head. She blinked and sighed, then pointed at me while gripping her throat with her other hand. *Is she saying I'm going to die?* I wondered. Suddenly I heard Venkatayya's voice call out, and Juhiamma started. She quickly drew something out of her blouse and tucked it into my back pocket.  Before I could check what it was, Venkatayya came over to the back of the house and saw me.\n\n\"There you are! What were you doing?\" he said cheerfully.\n\n\"Your wife was just showing me around..\" I said. I didn't know what she was saying or what she just did, but I didn't like the feeling of being here. *I should have just slept in my car.*.\n\n\"Come, come, join our celebration!\" Venkatayya cheerfully draped his arm around my shoulder are led me to the village center. Now, there was a table set up at one end of the ground.\n\n\"Since I'm the chief,\" he explained, \"I get a special table. And since you're my guest, you can join me!\"\n\nWe sat at the table and banana leaves were placed in front of us. The villagers sat on the ground in rows, and they were given leaves as well. Many of them kept staring at me, then quickly looking away. I was feeling very uncomfortable, but there wasn't anywhere to go. Two young men quickly joined us and started putting food on our leaves. It comprised of some sort of millet, along with a dish of tubers, a curry made with leaves I couldn't identify, and a large, hot piece of meat. Around us, the same food was being given to the other villagers.\n\nVenkatayya leaned toward me and said, \"All this is hunted or foraged. In honour of Ekanthapayyan, we prepare our food only with forest produce during the festival. The meat is deer.\"\n\nI'd never eaten deer before, so I tried a small piece with trepidation. It was tender and spicy, absolutely delicious. In fact, all the food was good, and I ate with gusto. Venkatayya laughed and patted my back, and the food almost made me forget my misgivings about the place. The colours seemed brighter, the sounds livelier, and the tastes sharper.\n\n\\---\n\nI woke up and blinked my bleary eyes. My throat was parched. I tried to get up, but realised my  hands were tied to a pole behind my back. Patches of colour slowly arranged themselves into shapes, and I could see around me. All the villagers were silently bowed on one knee, facing downwards. Despite them being a large crowd, there was no noise. Not one cough, sniffle or even the sound of someone shifting their weight. They may as well have been a field of dummies. As I gained my consciousness further, I realised it wasn't just the people. *The entire forest was silent*. None of the disharmonious cacophony of insects, no bats flying overhead, no herd of elephants in the distance. I felt a pit deep within my stomach.\n\nI slowly struggled, and felt a vague outline of something in my back pocket. As I slowly picked it out I realised it was a small knife! That was what Juhiamma had tucked in there. I slowly began sawing at my restraints, fervently blessing her in my thoughts.\n\nSuddenly I heard leaves cracking. In the stillness of the forest that night, they were loud as a thunderstorm. Venkatayya emerged from the foliage ahead. \n\n\"Hello my boy!\" he called out with a voice dripping with sickly sweetness, \"we still have some time, so I'll tell you a story to keep you busy. I didn't tell you the whole story of Ekanthapayyan, did I? Upon losing his son, his spirit went mad and continued to roam the forest. He was in a murderous rage and would kill anyone who came in his path! So we made a deal with him, many generations ago. All he wanted is another son..\n\n\"So once a year he comes to us, and we offer him someone to keep as his son. He will take good care of you, you know? He'll teach you to hunt, to forage, to feel the forest as you feel yourself. But eventually you'll start slipping up. You'll bring home poisonous berries. A rabbit will escape your faulty trap. You'll almost drown when you swim in the wrong part of the river. And he will not like that. He will scold you and beat you. One day, he won't be able to take it anymore, and he will kill his son again.  He comes to our village and leaves the previous one's clothes. After that, we have three days to find him a new son. It was such great luck you came along!\"\n\nVenkatayya threw his head back and laughed heartily. By now I had almost cut my ropes off. As long as he kept talking, I could free myself. I also was able to perceive a new sound breaking though the forest. It sounded like someone unsteadily walking, while producing what sounded like happy weeping. I felt my ropes yield. *Finally I was free!* Now I needed to bide my time...\n\n\"He's almost here.. It was nice knowing you, son. Don't get me wrong, We're just doing what we have to, to survive.\"\n\nI could finally see a shape emerging from the forest. What I had expected was... I'm not sure what I expected, but not this. Ekanthapayyan was just a regular man, albeit a bit taller and more muscular. He was dressed as a regular Irula hunter; a loincloth on his waist and a red cloth tied around his forehead, a bow slung over his back. His tattered white shirt, contrasting against his dark skin, was the sole concession to modernity. His features were sharp and he sported a thick moustache and beard. He spoke in a cracked voice, the corners of his lips turning up.\n\n\"Son?\"\n\nWhen he said that, I realised I was frozen, I quickly stood up and fled the clearing, frantically pointing to Venkatayya and saying, \"He's your son!\"\n\nI entered the foliage and hid. Something made me turn back. Venkatayya had become a blubbering mess, backing away from the approaching figure of Ekanthapayyan. The deity caught him by the wrist and began to take him to the forest. Just before stepping through, he turned to his left, and looked straight at me. His eyes were bright and intense as a tiger's, but they had no malice. Just tiredness, the mind of a man who had to live the same life over and over again. Abruptly he turned away and entered the forest. I quickly turned and ran as fast as I could. I don't know how long I ran; the forest blurred into itself and me feet kept up the tempo of a run, carrying me along without my knowledge. Somehow I landed up at a road and collapsed on it, hugging it and weeping. That was how the forest patrol found me an hour later. \n\nThey took me to their station and administered first aid. Later, over a cup of tea and vada, they asked me what happened. As soon as I mentioned the village, they exchanged knowing looks. They arranged for me to stay another night while my car got fixed up, and I drove straight home. \n\nAll this was about a year ago. I'm writing this now because of something that happened yesterday. When I opened my window, there was a pile of tattered, torn clothes on the sill. Venkatayya's clothes. Ekanthapayyan is looking for a new son. When I think of him, I remember his tired eyes. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to go with him after all..",

        "text": "Laugh away — I know you’re thinking of the old adage that one must never eat yellow snow. We all know the crude connotations behind that advisory. But what of *purple* snow?\n\nIn these dying days of winter, I hope frosty weather is behind us for a little while. I thought it might be wise to explain to all of you why you must never, under any circumstances, eat purple snow.\n\nIf your skin makes contact with even a single flake of the hellish contaminant, you face an unimaginable fate.\n\n“Look at this funky shit,” Tyreese laughed.\n\nMy brother was proudly cradling a fluffy snowball — seemingly dyed purple — in his shivering, gloveless hand. Proud of his discovery, he triumphantly licked it.\n\n“What the fuck is that?” I asked. “Drop it, Tyreese. You don’t know what you’re touching.”\n\n“Relax, I’m fine! You telling me somebody pissed purple urine?” He laughed.\n\nBefore I could respond, Tyreese screamed. The purple ball pancaked outwards, gloving itself around my brother’s hand and worming its way up his arm. I ran over to him as he clutched at the tentacles of the living thing.\n\n“Shit! It’s digging into me!” He cried.\n\n“What do I do? What do I *do*?” I screeched.\n\n“I… No… Get away from me,” Tyreese growled in a voice that wasn’t his own. “Don’t let it touch you.”\n\nHis bloodshot eyes locked onto mine, but I quickly realised they weren’t bloodshot at all — purple limbs were slinking across his pupils, attached to something that was growing within his body. My brother’s terrifying transformation only worsened from there.\n\nHis flesh developed the consistency of rubber. Slowly, but surely, Tyreese started to sink into the whiteness beneath him. I swiftly snapped a branch off a nearby tree and extended it for my brother to grab. But when he seized the twig to pull himself out of the quick-snow, his purple tentacles started to craftily coil themselves around the branch — they were spiralling towards me.\n\n“No!” Tyreese snarled. “Let go of it!”\n\nI yelled, releasing the branch and tumbling onto my back. Tyreese’s consistency had become that of gooey, flesh-coloured liquid. What remained of his body seeped out of his furry jacket and jeans, as it started to unify with the snow. My brother unleashed one final wail of excruciating agony as he liquified into a purple pool, staining the snow.\n\nWhen the scream abated, his lips fell still — they were the final body parts to vanish into the purple pool, and Tyreese’s parting words were hauntingly serene.\n\n“Oh… It’s beautiful, Jack. I think you should dip your toes in the pool.”\n\nI fled and didn’t turn back. I told family, friends, and police officers that I’d lost my brother in the woods. He was never found. And I couldn’t see any purple remnants when I returned to the forest in the light of day.\n\nI don’t know where my brother went, and I don’t know what claimed him. I *do* know never to eat purple snow. In fact, I simply stay indoors during the winter. And when snow starts to fall, I draw the curtains, just to be safe.\n\nSometimes, on particularly icy evenings, I am certain I hear my brother’s wispy voice, billowing against my window panes. It beckons me to venture into the snow.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "We had a pre-meeting before [our talk with Daniel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/111s5u1/how_to_survive_college_i_guess_this_is_what/).  Or rather, everyone showed up when I was getting off my shift at the coffee shop for the day.  My job is… getting better, actually.  Like I was convinced I was going to get fired and was all anxious about it for like two days and then nothing happened and all that anxiety just kinda went away.  Also my manager started saying things like ‘good job today’ and ‘you’re doing great’ just out of the blue and I kind of feel it’s a little forced - like she doesn’t bother doing that with anyone else - but you know, it’s reassuring, so I’ll take it.  My self-esteem needs all the help it can get.\n\nAlso I chased off a possum all on my own the other day so I’m feeling pretty good about that.\n\nActually it wasn’t on my own, she was standing in the doorway to make sure it all went okay but she didn’t have to step in to save me so I’m going to take that as a win.\n\nHitting someone in the face with a broom is *really* cathartic, btw.\n\n(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))\n\nGrayson showed up first.  It was only about ten minutes before the end of my shift and he ordered coffee while he waited.  He looked tired, but my manager is pretty strict about not chatting with friends while we’re on shift, so I couldn’t ask him about it.  And then after I clocked out, Maria showed up.  She greeted Grayson with more familiarity than I expected, considering the three of us haven’t really hung out in a group that much.  There was the steam tunnel incident and they’d run into each other a couple times since then, but not enough that I’d expect them to fall in together like old friends.  And Maria isn’t like Cassie, who is friends with about half of campus, somehow.\n\n“I have a plan for what we’re going to say to Daniel,” she said.  “But first - how did your counseling session go?”\n\nGrayson looked first at her and then at me.  I felt my cheeks go red.  Just blurt all my secrets out into the open, thanks Maria.\n\n“It’s fine,” Maria said quickly.  “Grayson knows all about the Daniel situation.  He’s been attending the Rain - sorry - Folklore Society - meetings too.”\n\n“Since one of the professors intervened to keep it going I was worried it might have something to do with the administration and I, well, that’s important to me,” he admitted sheepishly.  “I recognized Maria so I sat with her and then Daniel came barging in all freaked out and she caught me up on what’s going on.”\n\n“Oh,” I said.\n\nWhich really translated to ‘my feelings are hurt that no one told me this and I feel like I’m being left out - or worse - excluded because you don’t actually like me and are just tolerating my presence.’  But I couldn’t say that outloud yet, because the counselor I met with on Tuesday said that I should acknowledge how I feel and that I have a right to be upset with how other people treat me but also a lot of this anxiety might be self-inflicted and she didn’t give me any helpful tips on how to *fix* anything yet.\n\n“We, uh, mostly talked about my boyfriend,” I said uncomfortably.  “My *very* ex-boyfriend.  I told her he died in a car accident the night he, uh, he hit me.”\n\nThere was a very long silence.\n\n“*Finally*,” Maria sighed.  “I’ve been hoping you’d talk to someone about that for like half a year now.”\n\nThen she went digging in her purse for a pack of tissues and handed it to me.\n\n“Did she tell you that wasn’t your fault?” Maria asked.\n\n“Yes,” I replied miserably.\n\n“You don’t sound convinced.”\n\n“I’m not.”\n\nShe took a big step and spun around so that we were face to face.  I stopped walking and she clapped her hands together authoritatively.\n\n“So it’s not your fault,” she said, “and neither is Daniel.  I get that he’s bullying you right now - yes it *is* bullying - and I think we should deal with that, but maybe after he’s no longer *literally about to die horribly.*”\n\n“Yes, that does seem like the more pressing problem,” Grayson commented dryly.  “Everything else about him will probably be a lot easier to confront once that’s dealt with.”\n\nHonestly, from Grayson’s tone… I don’t think he likes Daniel that much either.  I guess he’s only seen the worst of him though - the panicked asshole side of him.  If that was my only impression, I’d probably not be feeling very charitable either.  I’ve at least seen the egotistical but mostly harmless side of him, how he makes people feel included just because he wants to be the center of their attention.\n\nYanno now that I say that, there’s not that much to like about Daniel, is there?\n\nMaria’s plan was kind of brilliant.  Honestly, as morbid as this sounds, I think what happened to Patricia was a bit of a wake-up call for her.  She seems to be taking the time to think things through now.  Meanwhile, I’m off making bargains with the laundry lady and the devil.\n\nPlease don’t scold me in the comments.\n\nWe’d meet up with Daniel in a few days, right before the weekend.  Maria thought it best to tell him about the idea of transferring the target, but not with the intention of actually going through with it.  She was hoping to shame him into dealing with the problem himself and would tell him that she had some weapons all ready to go.  If he was still scared, we’d go with him.  And if he wasn’t able to do it, then we’d get its attention and switch its target and then deal with it ourselves.\n\n“We’ll be useless in there,” I hissed.  “If he doesn’t get his shit together, we won’t be able to do anything to help him.”\n\n“I know,” Maria replied uncomfortably.  “But maybe him realizing that will be the push he needs to act.  I don’t think we can wait much longer.”\n\nI had to agree with that.  \n\n“And if it does work?” Grayson asked.  “If you become the target?”\n\n“Then I’ll kill it,” I said grimly.\n\n“You think you can?”\n\nHe sounded skeptical.  Can’t say I blame him.  I took a breath and thought of the eyeball, how I was scared and confused but how I killed it anyway.\n\n“Yeah.  I think I can.”\n\n“Okay so that’s the backup plan,” Maria said hastily.  “We just need to convince Daniel to go along with it now.”\n\nHe wasn’t going to like this.  He didn’t want to put himself in danger.  He wanted an easy answer, one where he stayed safe and as far from harm as possible.  We’d tried telling him we’d help with his task already and it didn’t go over well.  This was essentially the same solution, only repackaged so that it’d sound like he had a way out if he couldn’t do it in the end.\n\nExcept we didn’t think the way out would work.  We just needed to get him moving.\n\n“I think I know how to convince him,” I said.\n\nThere was one moment where Daniel was willing to act.  It was after Patricia and all the others died.  He had a spark of righteous indignation, an instinctive recoiling from something so horrific, and he’d demanded that we do *something*.  There was a moment where he seemed bigger than all of his flaws.\n\nSo we just needed to remind him of that and convince him he could be that person again.\n\nBut in the meantime I was going to go find a backup plan.  In case we couldn’t convince Daniel to deal with this problem himself, like he should.  In case we couldn’t transfer the target of the creature.  In case everything else fell through and he still blamed me for not being able to save him, because I’m not sure if I can deal with that.  Look, I know you all tell me it's not my fault and I can’t hold myself responsible except…\n\nLike.  My dad *vanished* out there and everyone just looked the other way and maybe it wasn’t their fault as well but I just wonder… did they try?\n\nSo I’m trying.\n\nI went to find the devil.  It wasn’t hard.  I saw him leaning against the doors of the chapel as I approached.\n\n“You knew I was looking for you?” I demanded.\n\n“Course I did.”\n\nHe shoved off the doors and came over to walk alongside me.  The sidewalk went in a long loop around this particular patch of greenery so we had plenty of room for a leisurely stroll.\n\n“Seems kind of weird that I find you outside the chapel,” I commented.\n\n“You’ve lived a sheltered life.  I won’t shock you with details, but I am hardly the only unholy thing that’s graced those grounds.”\n\nWell that’s something I didn’t need to know.  But I didn’t seek out the devil to have my naivete ruined, so I told him about my problem with Daniel and what we were planning to do about it.\n\n“So?” he asked when I was done.  “Why are you bothering me about this?”\n\n“I thought - maybe you’d have something I could use…?”\n\n“First off, that bargain was a one time thing,” he said curtly.  “Secondly, even if there was wiggle room in it for me to assist you again, I wouldn’t.  Because it’s not my problem. However, I’m apparently in a charitable mood, so I’m going to give you some advice.  It’s not your problem either.”\n\n“I need to help him!” I cried.\n\n“No,” he said coldly.  “*You* need to do nothing.  Didn’t I tell you already?  *This isn’t about you.*”\n\nOkay, so I can’t fix it for Daniel.  I get that.  But that doesn’t mean I can’t help, right?  There’s people that help the hero in their journey, right?  I said something along those lines to the devil, hoping he’d get what I was saying and, I don’t know, give me another pencil or something.\n\n“*Fine*,” he sighed dramatically.  “I guess I’ll help if it makes you shut up.  Come here.”\n\nHe stopped walking and I turned to face him.  He took a deep breath in and stared down at me, his face pinched critically.  I stood a little straighter under his inspection until he nodded in satisfaction.\n\n“I’m going to teach you what to do,” he instructed.  “Do this in front of a mirror.  Now give me your best serious and determined face.  C’mon.  Don’t be embarrassed.”\n\nI composed myself as best as I could.  Tightened my jaw and stared straight ahead as the devil mused for a moment before nodding in reluctant satisfaction.  He walked around behind me and placed both hands on my shoulders.\n\n“Okay, now this is going to be the hard part,” he said into my ear.  “Repeat after me.  ‘No.’”\n\n“Uh-”\n\n“C’mon, you can do it.”\n\n“No…?”\n\n“Yes!”  I winced at his triumphant cry.  “Just like that!  Try it again, but with *conviction*.”\n\n“No?”\n\n“Close enough for now.  Try some variations, like ‘no, I don’t want to do that’ or ‘no, and I’d like you to leave.”\n\nI pulled away and turned around to face him.\n\n“I’m sorry, but how is this helping?” I asked.\n\n“Well, if you can’t stand up for yourself, then you need to practice.  Every night, stand in front of a mirror and rehearse all the things you can say when you’re being asked to do something that makes you uncomfortable until it feels natural.  It’ll make it easier to tell your little friend here to go fuck himself in the future.”\n\n“This isn’t the kind of help I want!”\n\nHe rolled his eyes at me.  Yep.  *The literal devil* rolled his eyes at me like he was my tweenage sister.\n\n“Oh I’m sorry, do I look like a fucking fairy godmother?  I’m the devil!  I’m not here to fix all your problems.”\n\n“You’re a *trickster*,” I spat back.  “You love meddling.”\n\n“That I am.”  He sobered quickly.  “You forget why the tricksters often get recast into *my* role, however.  Are you *sure* you want to continue asking me for help?”\n\nThere was a sharp edge to his voice.  I felt like I was teetering on the edge of a cliff and if I didn’t watch where I stepped, I’d tumble over.  This *was* the devil I was dealing with.  He’d been cordial and *helpful* even, but even if he was acting in the trickster trope… well, tricksters still get people killed.  And stories involving the devil might start out as humorous pranks but at the end he took what he was due.  Someone got hurt.\n\nI didn’t reply.  My instincts were screaming at me to be quiet and to not push it any further.  I’d gone as far as I could.  The devil waited a moment more, his expression hard, then he finally shook his head and walked away, his thumbs stuck in his pockets.\n\n“I don’t get paid enough to deal with this shit,” he muttered.  “Call me when it’s something I actually care about.”\n\nWell, it wasn’t a great plan, but I had to try, right?  I was pretty despondent the rest of the day.  Our talk with Daniel was only a day away.  Maria planned to do it right before the weekend so we could use Saturday to prepare and execute our plan.  Give him as little time to back out as possible.  It was looking like our tight timeline was going to mean I wouldn’t have any solutions ready to go in case this didn’t work, though.  It made me feel sick to my stomach.\n\nI know how he’s going to die.  And I keep thinking about it and how horrible it is and… I just want to throw up from the stress of it all.\n\nAnyway that’s why I wound up at the only place on campus that’s open until midnight, stress eating.  Nothing like making a stress induced stomach ache worse with a couple slices of greasy pizza, right?\n\nCassie was asleep when I returned to the dorm.  She has an early class and tries to get to bed at a reasonable time so she’s not falling asleep during it.  And that’s something I don’t want to interfere with *at all*, not after my own encounter with the millipedes, so I try to be very careful and not wake her up.  I crept into the room as quietly as I could and then took my toothbrush down to the bathroom.\n\nSo far there haven’t been any monsters showing up there, but I still try not to shower late at night just in case.  Having to run naked down the hallway while being pursued by the evil embodiment of shampoo is pretty high on my list of things I never want to experience.\n\nI wasn’t alone in the hallway when I exited the bathroom.  Someone else was leaning into the open doorway of one of the rooms, his hand on the frame.  I didn’t think much of it at first, until I drew closer and realized that it was leaning into *my* dorm room.  \n\nThe one Cassie was currently asleep in.\n\nI quickened my pace, trying to call out and demand to know what he was doing.  The words just kind of squeaked out at first and I took a breath to try again.  I was silently panicking - I’d shut the door!  I remembered shutting the door - right?  Cassie was going to be *furious* with me.\n\nThen I froze and my words died before they escaped my lips.\n\nThe fingers were too long.  The fingertips were flattened into round blobs of flesh.  It reminded me of a tree frog.  And at first I thought it was wearing clothing, albeit in shades of beige.  There was something amiss about that, though.  There were no folds.  No hems.  The pattern on what I thought was a graphic t-shirt made no sense and I could see the ridge of its spine protruding from one of the dark blots on its back.  The collar of the shirt was uneven, following the ridge of its collarbones.\n\nIt wasn’t clothing.  It was the patterning of its skin.\n\nCamouflage.  Like a tiger’s stripes.  So it could blend in with us.  \n\nIt slowly turned its head to look at me.  I was expecting… all sorts of things, honestly.  Sharp teeth.  No face at all.  I got… a fairly ordinary face.  There was a nose.  Lips.  But its eyes were where the resemblance to a human face broke down.\n\nThere were no eyelids.  No deposits of fat padding the sockets.  Just round, staring eyes like golf balls.\n\nI screamed.\n\nOkay, it took a couple tries, I’m not going to lie.  The first attempt I filled my lungs and all that came out was a strangled squeak.  The creature continued to *stare* at me with those peeled eyes, motionless, its elongated fingers resting on the doorframe of our room.  It didn’t seem inclined to do anything but stare and some part of my mind was screaming that so long as it wasn’t hostile, as long as it wasn’t approaching me, I should just shut up and not do anything.\n\nThat it was bad enough that it had noticed me and I had noticed it.\n\nI shouldn’t cause trouble.  I should just be happy I was *alive* because that’s more than what most people get when they run into the inhuman.\n\nBut slowly, after another hoarse attempt at yelling, it turned its head away from me.  It took a step into our room.\n\nCassie.  It was going after Cassie.  It didn’t care about me at all.\n\nIt was halfway through the doorway when I screamed at it to stop.  That’s all I said - STOP.  As loud as I could.\n\nThese things don’t like an audience so I was going to bring one down on its ugly head.\n\nAnd doors banged open.  It wasn’t so late that everyone was asleep yet.  The creature jerked back out of our room and then sprinted down the hallway.  It hit the doors leading to the stairwell and was then *gone*.  \n\nCassie woke up in all the commotion.  Our RA got involved.  (I don’t like our RA)  I cried a lot and told them I saw someone trying to break into one of the dorm rooms.  Some of the doors can be forced with a credit card and that’s what he was doing to our door.\n\nSo then our RA got campus security involved and I had to repeat the story to them - which was awful because we all know there’s something weird going on with them - and an hour later I was finally able to go back to my room.  Campus security promised to increase the patrols around our dorm for a little while and see if they could scare off whoever it was from coming back.  Which won’t do shit.\n\nCassie was still awake.  She’d talked to them as well, just asking dumb questions like if she had a boyfriend or if she had valuables in her room that people knew about.  When I unlocked the door and stepped inside, I found her standing by the window.  She was staring at the car for campus security parked outside our dorm.\n\n“Was it really a person trying to break in?” she asked, not looking at me.\n\nI guess Cassie knows by now that nothing is ordinary with me.  I told her about the creature.  How it didn’t seem interested in me.  She didn’t seem surprised by this.  Her shoulders tensed, but that was all.  And when she spoke, I didn’t feel like she was talking to me.\n\n“I guess that’s what got her, then.” \n\nThat’s all she said.  Then she crawled into bed and I didn’t try to talk to her about it anymore, because she had the covers under her head and was trying to stifle her crying.\n\nBesides, I can put the pieces together well enough on my own.\n\nThat creature might be what killed her previous roommate.  And now it’s after her.[\\[x\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)\n\n[Read the first draft of the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/t34mbv/how_to_survive_college/)\n\n[Visit the college's website.](https://alderrayne.com/)",

        "text": "I am currently typing this from the public library as even the idea of being at home sends a shiver down my spine. My mom had been diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago, but it wasnt the chemotherapy/loss of hair type of cancer. It was a tumor on her spine, pushing slightly on the base of her brain. She got really bad 3 months ago. Barely able to walk without assistance, constant pain, the pressure would build up in her head so much she could tell when and where it was going to rain even from avout 4 states away.\n\nI give you this information because last month she wanted to go camping on her own. She wanted to call an uber, have it drop her off at a camp site, and she would camp for 2 nights. I didn't like the idea of this but I only allowed it because I didn't know how long she had left and I didn't want to deprive her of a possible last source of entertainment. Before she left she hugged and kissed me with a huge smile showing her five freckles. She was still beautiful after all she went through. I wished her goodbye and told her to call me if she needs help with even the smallest thing. The car door closed as it drove off. A few days later, she came back as a different person.\n\nShe was super positive all the time, like when I was a kid and the tumor didn't exist. She made breakfast, she was active, and seemed to have her pain under control. We went to an scan the next day and the tumor was gone. She spinal cord was still slightly damaged but she could (after a few weeks of physical therapy) resume full mobility.\n\nNow this was great, the doctors had called it a medical miracle, and I didn't leave her side for two weeks. She made me breakfast 2 days ago and gave me a huge grin. I looked at her face admiring her radiant, glowing smile. Her hazel eyes, cinnamon hair, and her 3 freckles. Wait, 3 freckles? I recounted, 1, 2, 3. Where are the other two? My mom has always had 5. And that was just the first thing I noticed. Every night my mom would write me notes on the counter for me to see when I woke up for school. I hadn't seen one over the past month. I know it's petty, but, ever since my sudden sentience at the age of 3 I saw those notes. I was embarassed by those notes. I missed those notes.\n\nAnd the biggest thing that bothered me was her smell. She always had a scent of cedar wood and lavender. Now she, doesn't have a smell. She smells sterilized, like there is no sign of humanity within her. There is something living in my mother's body but it isn't my mom. My mom is somewhere, I hope, not completely lost. When I left the house to go she gave me a kiss and told be to be safe. There was this glint in her eye. She knows I know. I don't feel safe and I don't have anyone to call. I'm posting this here before I go home hoping that people may give some advice. If I went to the police they'd call me crazy, then she'd find out. I just want to know what to do, if I live long enough.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my neighbor, Lynn, who was also my best friend, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend on the sidewalk in front of her house. I guess maybe because she was my best friend, even after a year had passed, I couldn't make myself delete her number from the contacts list on my phone. Every so often, when I deleted people I no longer wanted to hear from, or no longer needed to call, or couldn't remember who they were, I would think about deleting it, but I could never go through with it. I don't know, the idea of \"deleting\" her just seemed like too much.\n\nSo one day I scrolled past her name looking for somebody else's number and wondered what would happen if I called her. The phone rang twice, and she answered. I thought I was going to faint from the adrenaline shot that exploded in my head. I said, \"Lynnie, is that you?\" She said, \"Hello?\" and I said, \"Lynnie, can you hear me?\" She said, \"Hello,\" again and I said, \"Hey, Lynnie, it's me.\" Then she hung up. I thought about calling our other friends and telling them, but I realized how crazy I would sound, and how much I might upset everybody, so I didn't.\n\nThe next day I called the number again and she answered again, and once again she couldn't hear me. I called her eight or ten times over the next few days before she finally stopped answering the phone. I kept calling--I'm not proud of it, but there you go--but after that the calls went straight to voice mail. I would've left a message, but the box was full. I finally decided, OK just one more time, and this time she answered. She said, \"I don't know who you are, but please stop. You're  scaring me.\"\n\nI felt like the biggest jerk in the world. I mean, in her last minute alive she was afraid. Of a man. And I certainly didn't want to be the guy that frightened her after she was dead. That broke my heart to even think about. I wished I could've apologized, but that would've meant dialing that number. I didn't call her again, I didn't try texting her, but I also didn't delete her contact. I just couldn't.\n\nA month or so later, when our friend Betsy mentioned Lynn one night at dinner, I asked her if she still had Lynn's number on her phone. She did. I said, \"I wonder what would happen if you called it?\" She pulled our her phone and called. She listened for a minute and then and shrugged. \"It's been disconnected,\" she said. \"What did you think was going to happen?\" I kind of halfway laughed and said, \"I was hoping she would answer.\" Betsy said, \"I get that, but, seriously, that's a little messed up,\" and that was the last time we talked about it. I haven't tried to call Lynn again, because I don't want to scare her, but I still wish she would call me.",

        "text": "Hey guys, sorry about not posting for a while. The internet went down and we had to figure out how to fix it. And yes, I said we. I will get to that, though.\n\nSince my last post you guys have given me some incredible advice. I would not be alive without you guys. I think that I will survive until the end of this. And I thank you guys for keeping me alive for that first night after my post.\n\nI have kept a journal of everything that transpired since my last post, and I will continue to update it until the snow is gone. Whether that takes months, years or even decades. This post is me copying down my journal so far.\n\nI posted my situation on Reddit with the remaining internet. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get another post out, though. However Someone reminded me that the clipboard that Mr Terry had was still downstairs, so I went back down and read the clipboard. It was a list of my family members with an X next to everyone but me. My name was highlighted in red with a note.\n\n“my son, I Hope I don't have to kill you. If you are reading this, you killed me. I hope you don't lose sleep over that fact. I'm not exactly the person I made myself out to be. I have done horrible things. My death is an overall benefit to you and everyone around you. I'm only doing this because I have to to survive. If I kill your family before you kill me, I am sincerely sorry. My boss is very strict. I hope you can bring yourself to do whatever it takes to live on. This does not need to be the end.\nLove...\nDad”\n\nIt's been a while since I read the note and I'm still shaken about that fact that he was my actual dad. He always seemed fatherly, but he was like that to everyone. The more I think about it, the more it hurts my brain, yet it makes complete sense.\n\nAfter going to sleep, I had a really creepy dream. The whole world just covered in snow with me, alone, standing in a white void. It felt way too real. I hade to convince myself that I was actually awake after I woke up.\n\nI convinced myself to go and grab my \"dad\" from the snow after someone wrote to me about the consequences of me giving up. I'm waiting for him to defrost right now. I have a camping stove I am going to use to cook him once he isn't a popsicle.\n\nOn another topic, after I find something to break through the roof with, I'm going to venture outside and find a taller building to take refuge in. I think I might be able to make it to Saint Paul where I can get into the Mall of America. Hopefully anyone inside will accept me once I get there. This apparently a worldwide thing. People are calling it the next ice age.\n\nI think the snow is thinner near the top of the house, because that's the only place I can get internet. but the blistering cold will make it difficult to get very far once I break through. I forgot to mention it, but it's been around -40 degrees for the last few days. It's not that the sun went out, because a small amount of light makes it through the snow while I'm upstairs\n\nI really hope I didn't just hear what I thought I heard. It was a scratching sound coming from the window. Sorry if this looks weird, I'm writing this as stuff happens. Freaky shit is going on, though it's not like this is a stereotypical horror story, so it can't be a monster or some shit. I'm going to go check it out.\n\nIt was just a cat. That was fucking scary, though. It was just looking for food. It was really cold so I brought it inside and let it lay on my heater. Poor thing was nearly frozen solid. I now have a companion, though. It's a cat so it might run away as soon as I get back upstairs\n\nMy dad is sufficiently unthawed, so I'm going to go cook now, I will hopefully update you all later. I'll try to just think “long pig” while cooking. Hopefully that prevents me from vomiting.\n\nUntil next time, friends.\n-Jason\n\nHey, it’s me again, Jason. I’m Sitting in a pile of snow right now with Devi. That’s what I named my cat. It’s been about a week since my last entry and I thought I might start writing down what’s been happening in the off-chance that I survive this.\n\nI made it outside and it’s really hard to navigate towards the big city when you have no point of reference, so I just started walking in a direction that felt right. Progress has been slow, but it will be worth it, right? I actually met someone today that pointed me in the right direction. Apparently there’s a full settlement in the MOA, so I was right to start going in that direction.\n\nI think I am about halfway there, but I feel like I’m being followed. And the presence doesn’t feel human. I think I need to hurry, but here I am, writing on a damn pad of paper while the… thing… could be nearby. \n\nOn a brighter note, however, my cellular data is still working. Most of my friends have texted me to see if I’m alright. I told them that I was and where I’m heading. Preston still hasn’t texted back though. I really hope that he’s alright. \n\nUntil next time, friends\n-Jason\n\nHey. It’s me again. I’m genuinely shocked that I’m alive after that encounter, though. The thing I wrote about 4 days ago caught up to me and it was DEFINITELY not human, but I can’t really say that it was an animal, either. It was digging through the snow with tendril-like arms. It’s entire body was a pale white, and it seemed to… warp reality? I’m not even sure what was happening. The space around looked like that wavy look that the air above hot asphalt has. I’m not really great at describing that effect. I think it’s called a mirage?\n\nAnyways, it emerged from the snow and just sorta… looked through me Like I wasn’t even there, but it acknowledged my presence at the same time. It looked hungry, despite not having a face. The next few minutes were a blur, I don’t even remember what happened, just that I woke up surrounded by people and both of my legs were almost completely shattered. Someone heard me scream and came to get me. I was apparently unconscious for a day.\n\nI’m sitting inside the caribou coffee shop right now. And I’m writing this after someone explained what happened to me. The creature was a complete illusion, caused by my long exposure to the snow. It was real, it can and did physically hurt me, but it is only able to harm someone after a full day of contact with what we’re now calling “pale snow”. Pale snow has a hallucinogenic property that causes the creature, which they decided to call “the snowy stalker”, to become visible to the human eye.\n\nIt cannot hurt someone unless they can see it. The Snowy Stalker is everywhere, yet nowhere at the same time. Really something that you have to see to believe it exists. Everyone sees it slightly differently, but it’s still the same premise. Long, lanky legs, short torso, tendril-like arms, no face, and its movements seem to be non-Euclidean.\n\nI just realized that it might be a beast from the 4th dimension, considering that it moves in an extremely weird way, and everyone sees it slightly differently. Riley seems to agree after some thought. I’m being wheeled to the main area to tell people about my theory. If I’m right, then things are going to get complicated extremely quickly.\n\nUntil next time, friends\n-Jason\n\nThat was my last entry since I left my house. And I completely forgot to mention that day 3 of me being outside is when the internet went out. We have fixed it though. But we did lose Daniel to the snowy lurker. Apparently once someone has seen the lurker, they are never safe when on pale snow. The difference between regular snow and pale snow is that pale snow is completely 100% white. You cannot see the terrain of that snow. Imagine black 3.0 except white.\n\nDevi is alright, and still sitting on my lap. I might lose my legs though. They really are shattered. \n\nOne more thing I should mention is that my friends are on their way. I have warned them about the pale snow.\n\nThe doctor came to talk to me about half an hour ago and yeah, I will be losing my lower legs. It’s not as bad as it could have been, I could have lost my entire lower body, but I’m still pretty emotional right now. I will try to respond to any comments, though\n\nUntil my next post, friends\n-Jason",

        "text": "I was once a patient in a psychiatric ward, and to this day, I can still feel the shadows creeping up on me. They were always there, lurking in the corners of my mind, tormenting me with their presence. I was never able to control my thoughts or actions because they were always there, whispering to me, urging me to do things I didn't want to do.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. I would see things out of the corner of my eye, a fleeting glimpse of a dark figure moving in the shadows. But as time went on, the shadows became more and more real. They would whisper to me in the dead of night, telling me to do unspeakable things.\n\nI tried to ignore them, to shut them out, but they were always there, lurking in the dark corners of my mind. And then one night, they finally took control. I don't remember much of what happened, but when I woke up the next morning, I was covered in blood.\n\nThe nurses tried to tell me that it was just a nightmare, that I had imagined everything, but I knew the truth. The shadows had taken control, and I was just a puppet, dancing to their tune.\n\nAfter that, they put me in isolation, locked me away in a small, windowless room. I thought that would be the end of it, that the shadows would finally leave me alone. But I was wrong. They were still there, whispering to me through the walls, calling out to me in the darkness.\n\nDays turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and I began to lose track of time. I was trapped in my own mind, tormented by the shadows that would never leave me alone.\n\nAnd then one day, I woke up to find that the door to my room was open. I don't know how it happened, but I knew it was a trap. The shadows were luring me out, tempting me with the promise of freedom.\n\nBut I couldn't resist. I stumbled out of my room, my heart pounding in my chest. The hallway was dark, and I could hear the whispers of the shadows echoing through the walls.\n\nI tried to run, but my legs felt like lead. The shadows were closing in on me, suffocating me with their darkness. And then I saw it, a figure standing at the end of the hallway, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.\n\nI tried to turn back, but it was too late. The figure stepped forward, and I felt a cold, clammy hand close around my neck. And then everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was back in my room, but something was different. The shadows were gone, and I felt a sense of peace that I had never experienced before. I don't know what happened that night, but I do know one thing. The shadows are real, and they will never stop tormenting me.",
