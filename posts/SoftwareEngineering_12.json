        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/z4yd9z/mobile_app_security_for_2023/",
        "text": " \n\nIn the era of technology, mobiles have become unavoidable and they are the most widely used device in the world. Mobiles are full of apps, but the security of the apps has become a concern for users. Due to the momentous rise in cyber attacks, developing an app that is completely safe to use is a crucial component in mobile app development. This ensures an uncomplicated business operation. Previously,  mobile apps are mostly used for entertainment and social media, but now the time has changed they are used for various purposes including payment processes.\n\n## Checklist to Secure Your Mobile Apps for 2023\n\nMost apps now we use collect our behavioral data in the background. Hence you need to prioritize mobile app security more than anything in your next mobile app development. So how do you keep your personal and business data protected from such cyber attacks? No worries, in this blog we will guide you about mobile app security. Below we have given the complete checklist to secure your mobile app.\n\n### Code Signing Certificate to Secure your Mobile App\n\nThe most vulnerable are open-source software. Cybercriminals have no trouble attacking these applications. By including a code signing certificate into your software, you may avoid these cyber-attacks. To make the app resistant to cyber criminals, the software code should be intact and safe, with a code signing certificate to avoid virus multiplication.\n\nHowever, it is critical to store your signing code certificate in a secure location to avoid attackers looking for the security code. You can also keep your files secure by using non-intruding and unique passwords. Symantec code signing certificate, Comodo code signing certificate, and Sectigo code signing certificate are a few well-known code signing certificates.\n\n## Multi-factor Authentication(MFA)\n\n(MFA) is one of the essential factors to secure your mobile apps from cyber attacks. MFA is an authentication procedure that requires to user to provide more than one verification factor to access the target resources. The widely used authentication process only asks the user to provide a username and password, but in the case of MFA the user to need complete additional verification factors.\n\nThis can be a combination of OTP, biometric verification, calls and security questions. It ensures no one can use your device except you and can take the required measures if a cyber attack happens.\n\n## Encrypt Mobile Communication\n\nAs the usage of cellular and wifi networks increases, cyber attacks through these channels have become very common. So encrypting the communication between mobile servers is inevitable. Powerful encryption and SSL keys like 4096, can stop the cyber attackers from decrypting the data. It is equally important to encrypt your devices as encrypting the traffic. As far as ultra-sensitive data is concerned, it is important to safeguard data from being downloaded to the end user’s device.\n\n## Runtime App self-protection\n\nRuntime application self-protection is an emerging technology that stops cyber attackers from attempting to hack your application and steal your data. RASP technology can be built into your application to prevent real-time attacks and detect vulnerabilities. RASP is capable of detecting, blocking, and mitigating attacks. This technology can protect your application from data without human intervention.\n\n## Install Tamper-Detection tools\n\nVarious technologies can detect when the app code is modified and can give warnings. Therefore, you need to develop an app in a way that can give warnings when the code is changed. The leading tampering strategy is an injection, including alteration in java code and transformation in code. These tamperings can be controlled by the tamper identification software. This software can stop malware from replicating and causing further harm to your application.\n\n## Secure Application Programming Interface\n\nApplication programming interfaces are responsible for integrating third-party services. API facilitates the systems to interconnect for data exchange and boosting functionality. An unsecured API is always vulnerable and the data exchanged can be decrypted by the attackers. To ensure the security of the application, conduct API security testing.\n\n## Static Application Security Testing(SAST)\n\nStatic analysis is a testing strategy, that is capable of analyzing application code and security loopholes of your mobile application. Static application security testing can investigate the application before the code is compiled and can discover unauthorized access. Apktool, Cydia, and App track are some of the tools used in static application security testing.\n\n## Prevent Data Leaks \n\nMobile users tend to install various apps on their devices without knowing their authenticity. It is important to isolate each app from one another to avoid data leaks. This restricts the malware from accessing sensitive information. The possible way for preventing data leaks are \n\n* Restrict screen capture\n* Watermark malicious files with usernames\n* Stop copy and paste function\n* Restrict users from downloading confidential files.\n\n## Summing up\n\nTo summarise, cyber attacks by hackers have become increasingly widespread in recent years. Even the most secure systems can be hacked. As a result, if you are intending to design a mobile application for your business, it is critical to remember that security is the most significant component in protecting your sensitive data from hackers. Consider following the above-mentioned security checklist to avoid losing your data to cybercriminals.\n\nAs you all know[ **Adhoc** ](https://www.adhocsoftwares.com/)[**Softwares**](https://www.adhocsoftwares.com/) is a leading App development company known for its unmatchable customer service and satisfaction, we implement various as we mentioned above, security testing procedures while developing an app to protect your valuable data from cyber attacks.",

        "author": "Adhocsoftwares",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/z4yazt/secure_your_website_a_complete_checklist_for_2022/",
        "text": " \n\nAs more people use the internet for many purposes, including web searches, having a safe and secure website has become more important than ever. You may think, why would someone hack into a small business’s website, but the truth is small business websites are most vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An unsecured website is always dangerous for you and your website visitors. As a website owner, you need to protect your website from hackers. Fortunately, there are a variety of things you can do to protect your website from cyber-attacks. Below, we will start with some basic steps to secure your website from hackers.\n\n## 1. Use safe and strong passwords:\n\nThe first step in safeguarding your website is to create a secure password. All of the websites are password-protected. However, the strength of the password is crucial. Choose a password that is both strong and difficult to guess. A strong and secure password includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, symbols, signs, and numbers. Tools like a password manager can help you create strong and secured passwords.\n\n## 2. Install security plugins\n\nIf you built your website with content management systems like WordPress, Magento, Drupal, and Wix, you can improve the website security by installing security plugins. These plugins are capable of protecting your website from cyber-attacks to some extent. Most of the CMS platforms come with free security plugins. Some of the plugins are listed below\n\n* Sucuri security\n* iTheme security\n* Wordfence security\n* Patchstack\n\n## 3. Use HTTPS-SSL certification\n\nHTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a security protocol used to secure websites. The lock icon next to the web address indicates that the site is secured. The site is secured with the SSL certification. SSL certification encrypts the data transfer between the server and the visitor’s browser. This accreditation is required for websites that need payment procedures and sensitive data. Search engines such as Google regard websites that lack SSL certification to be insecure. Secure your website with SSL certification if you want people to trust it.\n\n## 4. Use secure cookies\n\nThis feature adds a layer of security between the server and the website visitor. The data information in the encrypted cookies is safer from hackers. Secure cookies may only be transferred via an SSL connection, hence the website must be SSL certified to use them.\n\n## 5. Update your software and website platform regularly:\n\nUpdating your software and the operating system keeps your website running smoothly. These updates contain new security patches. Most of the updates require only a system restart and installation process. Website owners mostly ignore these updates, but this is a dangerous practice that can even lead to losing your website. Thus, you should install these updates to secure your entire system.\n\n## 6. Secure your site from SQL injection\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is a type of code that manages and allows people to search for information in your site databases. But the (SQL) is often misused by hackers. Hackers insert specific codes into your database to manipulate and steal data from your site. Hackers get in through URL parameters and form fields to damage the databases. This is called an SQL attack. To secure your website from SQL attacks set up parameterized queries and create secure forms.\n\n## 7. Limit user permission and access\n\nA website is nothing but a set of folders and files stored in your web hosting account. These are the files responsible for the proper functioning of the site. Hackers can access these files to steal sensitive data from your website. Limit the user’s permission to read, write and execute any changes in the file. Use a strong and secure password for your account. You can also set security permissions to these files and folders. Ensure every user follows all the preventive security measures before accessing these files and folders.\n\n## 8. Backup your site regularly:\n\nAll websites, regardless of size or value, are vulnerable to data theft. In the event of a website hack, the worst-case scenario is losing all of your data. To keep your website safe, make regular backups. If you have a recent backup, recovering your website is significantly easier. You could also consider purchasing an automatic backup solution. The automatic backup mechanism can back up your website without your intervention.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWith the rise in cyber crimes, leaving your website without any protection can destroy site data. Most importantly, recovering your website may cost you a lot of money. So give the most priority to secure your website especially, if you run an online business.\n\nImplement the above steps to secure your website from cyber-attacks and data breaches.\n\nAs a custom web development company for nearly a decade[, **Adhoc Softwares**](https://www.adhocsoftwares.com/) have created and implemented various security rules to protect website from cyber-attacks.

        "text": "I'm working in an agile group on a Java project that contains a lot of poorly named classes/variables, incorrect comments, anti patterns, large methods, etc. It goes against my grain to see these errors so I tend to correct them while working on other features. But that makes for large code commits and the pull request reviewers are now complaining about my \"unnecessary\" changes claiming that I'm wasting everyone's time. But I can't stand looking at these issues/inefficiencies. It's like reading a poorly written paragraph, run on sentences and all, without being allowed to correct it. I'm even getting flak for turning an \"if\" statement into a lambda expression because it's \"more confusing\". \n\nI'm sure others have been in this situation. Other than leaving the group what is the best way to handle this? At this point I'm resigned to leaving the crappy code alone and living with it. Doesn't reinforce good practices or allow for being creative.",

A possible call to the endpoint could look like this: \"/v1/orders?age=15&amp;status=COMPLETE\". The other engineer proposes the idea, since it is facing the user app in a particular context, to implement the endpoint \"/v1/getOrdersForContext\", without any parameters, since we know the parameters are exactly: age = 15 and status = COMPLETE, for now.\n\nWhich solution is better?",
