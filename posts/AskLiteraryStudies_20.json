        "text": "1. While no one knows what really brought about the strange symptoms of several children near Salem that led to the Puritan witch hunts, Miller creates the character of Abigail Williams as a very wicked (and mature) catalyst. What attitudes about women are portrayed in the depictions of Abigail Williams, John Proctor, and Elizabeth Proctor?  After all, John Proctor has initiated an affair with Abigail Williams, a teenaged servant in his home, but he's still the hero, and a reader of the 50s or perhaps even a viewer in the 90s may tend to displace responsibility for that, especially since Abigail Williams is portrayed as such a thoroughly wicked character, and Elizabeth Proctor is portrayed as so morally upright as to be somewhat boring.  Does an audience necessarily identify John Proctor's responsibility for the situation? And, if not, what statement does this make about gender roles in the 1950s and perhaps in the 1990s, even? I choose these dates because Miller wrote the play in the 50s and the screenplay in the 90s.  Would the situation be the same if, for instance, Elizabeth Proctor, had initiated an affair with an especially tempting and wicked stable boy? \n\n2. In one of the most heated court scenes of the film, Judge Danforth proclaims, \"You stand either with this court or with the Devil.\" At many other times in recorded history has such a false dilemma led to widescale persecution and/or state-sponsored violence. Besides the Puritan witch hangings or the McCarthy period, what is at least one other moment in history (anywhere, anytime) in which you perceive a similar scenario at play? Explain.",

        "text": "Please excuse the obtuseness of the title; this question is hard to make succinct. I promise you, at the bottom of it (I at least think) I'm wondering something non-trivial.\n\nI can understand writing a long poem in blank verse in a preliterate culture--without writing it's pretty hard to hold all the details of a ~100,000-word tale in your head at once. The rhythmic aspect of poetry certainly aids memorization in ways that all of you here are much better equipped to explain than I. On the other hand, writing a narrative in verse is not easy going. Sure, practiced poets and bards can improvise in verse like a storyteller can in prose, but no doubt this requires enormous amounts of effort and training to do. So a poetic narrative may be hard to construct, but has its upside re: memorization.\n\nBut in a postliterate culture, recollection isn't such a big deal. And the later it gets in history, the less practical value a long poem has. By the time we get to Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton etc., the need for memorization has decreased greatly, if not disappeared altogether (OK, excepting Shakespeare). Yet the long poem persists, and in the hands of those masters, produces pillars of the Western canon. So long poetic forms must not only aid memorization, but do something *for the poem*, not just for the reciter.\n\nThis is what I'm wondering: what good is a poetic narrative? What is it doing? What effects does it produce?\n\nI've never quite been able to figure this out. I mean, I absolutely love Homer, Virgil et al, but I can't quite explain why. And there's a greatness to the *Iliad* of Pope that just isn't there in prose translations. There's something that *Ballad of the White Horse* does that prose would not be able to do. But unfortunately I haven't got far in figuring out just what that something is. The closest I've come is to guess that perhaps the rhythm and regularity of metre produces a kind of trance effect on the audience, putting them into a different (and perhaps more open?) frame of mind. But that's a guess.\n\nAnd this is where you guys come in. Please, r/AskLiteraryStudies, I need some expert guidance here: why write a long poem?",

There's usually one significant difference between the first sequence and the second; as with characters that serve as literary foils, the similarities between the two sequences serve to highlight and emphasize the contrast.\n\nA strong example from modern film is found in Mystic River. Twice in the movie:\n\n1) Dave (played as an adult by Tim Robbins), is lured into a car under false pretenses by people looking to do him harm,  \n\n2) The man in the passenger seat turns around and gives a creepy smille,\n\n3) The the scene ends viewing the car from behind as it drives away with a terrified/uncertain Dave looking out the window. \n\nThe first time, the bad guys are child molesters posing as cops. Dave is held hostage and abused for a few days before he escapes. The second time, the bad guys are thugs working for Dave's childhood friend, Jimmy (Sean Penn), now a mob boss who falsely believes that Dave killed his daughter. This time, Dave is killed by the friend who watched as he was taken away the first time.\n\nAnyway, I would think modern literature, usually more linear in its storytelling, would have fewer examples of this than the works of antiquities. Any examples anyone could think of would be helpful, however. Thanks.",

I found Alistair MacIntyre's critique of modernist ethics seen in After Virtue to be quite compelling. I've also recently stumbled upon [this article by Karen Armstrong,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/11/terrorism.politicsphilosophyandsociety) and now I want to read some of her works. This problem, I think, extends into even pop atheism, or New Atheism, as well. Fundamentalist Christians defend what they consider a literal interpretation of the Bible while New Atheists use fundamental Christianity as a strawman to disregard religion as a whole (as she mentions in the article). What they don't seem to recognize is how similar their approaches to information are. Just from different sources. \n\nI grew up in a \"Trump is the second coming of Paul\" type Billy Graham Evangelist household, so I've seen how defensively and quickly people will play the martyr card. Mentioning the errancy of the Bible, Quran, or The God Delusion is offensive to fundamentalists, and explanations of logical fallacies or history outside of what they already believe are easily dismissed as the deceptive work of Satan. Or twisted to fit their own set beliefs. \n\nWhat is the best way to open a conversation about the subjectivity of interpretation, genre, figurative language in holy texts, ideology, genealogy, power discourse, and so forth without instigating immediate quarantine and psuedo-martyrdom from these people? I'd suggest they read up on the topics, but I know they won't. Many have pridefully told me. \n\nIn the past, I've discovered the best way of handling these matters being simply to ignore them, but in light of recent, inauspicious signs of rising fascism as well as the propaganda battles of fake news, I can't help but feel a responsibility to bringing back understandings of pre-enlightenment/poetic truth or truth based on objectivity and statistics. Of course I mean in combination with enlightenment advancements. Not to go completely back, but to recognize it as still an important aspect of understanding. \n\nAny time I try to socratically engage in these discussions, I hit a wall of conceptual incommensurability. What is a better way to approach these situations? Thank you in advance for the help. As a passionate, but inexperienced undergrad student, I always appreciate it.

One of the texts prescribed in the course is the first chapter of Gender Trouble by Judith Butler. I have been attempting slow, close reading of the text, but her prose appears to be too complicated(perhaps intentionally) and many of her concepts don't make sense. Also, she alludes to philosophy(such as ontology, Sartre, reification) which further complicated the issue for me as I do not have a background in philosophy.\n\nOne such example:\n\n&gt;For Beauvoir, the \"subject\" within the existential analytic of misogyny is always already masculine, conflated with the universal, differentiating itself from a feminine \"Other\" outside the universalizing norms of personhood, hopelessly particular, embodied, condemned to immanence. Although Beauvoir is often understood to be calling for the right of women, in effect, to become existential subjects and, hence, for inclusion withing the terms of an abstract universality, her position also implies a fundamental critique of the very disembodiment of the abstract masculine epistemological subject. That subject is abstract to the extent that it disavows its socially marked embodiment and, further, prjects that disavowed and disparaged embodiment on to the feminine sphere, effectively renaming the body as female. This association of the body with the female works along magical relations of reciprocity whereby the female sex becomes restricted to ts body, and the male body, fully disavowed, becomes paradoxically, the incorporeal instrument of an ostensibly radical freedom.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nEDIT: Looks like I'm not alone- r/askphilosophy/comments/28q9gw/does_there_ever_come_a_time_when_you_can_look_at/",

Mae is shamed into selling the loaf of bread for cheap, but then sympathizes with the migrant family and sells the two pieces of nickel candy for a penny.\n\nThe two truckers leave a huge tip, because Mae cared for another human being, reinforcing the lecture from the previous chapter. As they leave, she calls them back for their change and one trucker says, \"Go to hell.\" \n\nIs that playful banter? Is he telling her to keep the change? They were joking before the migrant family came in, which at first made me think it was that. Or is Steinbeck siding with the family and the truckers, saying these business people have lost their way? The real salt of the earth people are the noble ones? \n\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm not sure.

I have plenty of support from my parents, and I just don't want to get into a field that has to do with using my hands, because not only do I hate doing stuff like that, I really can't stand the sort of people in those professions. It feels like the only things that interest me in school is philosophy, literature (I actually have to take writing 101 and 102 before I can go onto the literature courses), and psychology and perhaps sociology. \n\nI don't really actually want to do this, but I sort of feel like I should try to get some sort of education. No one's really pushing me to do anything, and so I have just been living in this apartment that my parents pay for me. I decided that I would tell my parents that I wanted to take up some courses, and this is about the third time I've tried going to college, but I just hate school. I did terrible in high school so I have to take some classes as a non degree seeking student, so I can get credits and transfer them over into the school so I can become a full time student. It's weird and complicated. But I don't really want to do this, I'd much rather not do anything at all. \n\nI'm just sort of worn out of this whole work school live thing. At times I just feel so worn out of it it makes me feel like I'm suffocating inside of my own brain. I wish that I just didn't have to participate in society. If you knew the story of my experience all throughout 6th through 12th grade you'd probably understand how the life and will could get sucked out of a person like it did for me.\n",

I plan to focus on the description of female power in terms of sexuality (Gloria from *The Beautiful and Damned*) and the downfall of men in giving up their power by focusing too much on sex (Anthony Patch also from *The Beautiful and Damned* but I want to incorporate Don Driver's downfall from *Tender is the Night* as well).\n\nThe only problem is I need theorists to go with these ideas. I'm going to use Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic to discuss the struggle between the genders as a result of women gaining more liberties at the beginning of the 20th century, and maybe some Nietzsche in there as well. I plan on looking through Beauvoir's *The Second Sex* and Foucault's *The History of Sexuality* because both were recommended to me by a professor as being relevant to my topic.

        "text": "I read a book of Argentinian folk fairy tales written in 1940, *Las mil y una noches argentinas*, compiled by Juan Draghi Lucero. In one of the short stories (\"El mal guardián\") there is a magic duel between a young man and a witch that reminds me of the aforementioned battle (Wizard's Duel, as it's called in the 1963 film). In short, the man transforms into an animal (mouse, guanaco, dove) and the witch into another that gives him chase (cat/armadillo, maned wolf, sparrow hawk). Afterwards they both transform into snakes and fight, then into a puma and a panther and keep at it, and I won't spoil the ending.\n\nI haven't read anything from the Arthuric cycle, but I remembered the movie and guessed that the duel was based in an earlier literary version (and maybe the Argentinian folk tale too). However after a quick Google search I haven't found anything about one-on-one duels between Merlin and somebody else. It's probable that I'm missing something obvious and I hoped someone that is actually knowledgeable about it could tell me.\n\nOr maybe this kind of magic duel in which the parties keep transforming into animals seeking to trump themselves is actually an old literary topic and I just wasn't aware of it.",

In a way i guess that seems fair enough, seeing as christianity is an integral part of western history, but seeing as I'm pretty non-religious myself I guess I'd prefer something more... neutral, if possible?\n\nSo are there other, more \"neutral\" audiobooks/lectures available, or should i just ignore my friend's criticism of Mr. Markos and give him a go?\n\nThanks for your time!",

He was talking to a pet/companion of sort who hands him a nut every once in a while during the story. He remembers hating cars and warmachines so he made all of the wheels in the world square so they wouldn't work anymore. Mankind responded by creating flying machines that still brought war. This goes on with other things he changed that never worked until he had a final plan: make every cruel person in the world half their size. In the end: [he sits back in his chair and assures himself that the spell worked, but when he reaches for another nut from his pet, he finds that he no longer can grab the nut because he has become half his size.](/spoiler) \n\nI have no idea who the author is, or what the title might be.

I find that the thing I enjoy most is indulging myself in deep mental thought, reading articles all day on interesting topics and reading from a selection of my library of books in my apartment which my parents pay for. I feel like shit from not moving around much all day or really talking to anyone ever, but I hope that in spite of the fact that I have no aspiration to do anything in life and I sort of hate being alive, that I'll somehow enjoy myself in english and philosophy, because at least that will satisfy one thing that I enjoy doing, and it seems like a step of doing something as opposed to just doing nothing at all.

        "text": "Hi, my literature comprehension is lacking. I often don't understand a passage despite knowing individual words. For example:\n\n\n*But is it upon the heroines that we would cast a final glance. 'I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little girl,' says Dorothea Casaubon. 'I used to pray so much - now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have desires merely for myself...' She is speaking for them all. That is their problem. They cannot live without religion, and they start out on the search for one when they are little girls. Each has the deep feminine passion for goodness, which makes the place where she stands in aspiration and agony the heart of the book - still and cloistered like a place of worship, but that she no longer knows to whom to pray. In learning they seek their goal; in the ordinary tasks of womanhood; in the wider service of their kind. They do not find what they seek, and we cannot wonder. The ancient consciousness of woman, charged with suffering and sensibility, and for so many ages dumb, seems in them to have brimmed and overflowed and uttered a demand for something - they scarcely know what - for something that is perhaps incompatible with the facts of human existence. George Eliot had far too strong an intelligence to tamper with those facts, and too broad a humour to mitigate the truth because it was a stern one. Save for the supreme courage of their endeavour, the struggle ends, for her heroines, in tragedy, or in a compromise that is even more melancholy.*\n\nI can vaguely guess what the author is trying to say but I'm lost when it comes to specific sentences. What's the meaning of the second sentence? The third? I'm not sure.\n\nMy questions are: What does the passage mean? Most importantly, how can I improve my understanding on my own? (Also, is it possible to post here comprehension help often?) Thank you!\n\n",

        "text": "I am currently in the process of carrying out research for my literary dissertation. Primarily, I am interested in what role women have in the urban environment, and the concept of the \"flâneur\". I want to question whether or not a female equivalent, a \"flâneuse\", can truly exist, and if so does this equivalent have to be reinvented (or is it possible for a women to adopt the \"masculine traits\" of a flâneur\")?\n\nMy original choice of texts for exploring this subject were \n-Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf (1927) \n-Anaïs Nin's A Spy in the House of Love (1954) and \n-Jean Rhy's Good Morning, Midnight (1939)\n\nHowever, I am wondering whether or not I should focus on a more condensed period of time (choosing books written during the same period of time, the modernist period would be great!), or open it out to a much wider context, choosing a novel from the late 1800s (when the idea of the flâneur was first arising), one of the above novels, and a contemporary novel (most likely Kate Zambreno's Green Girl).\n\n\nANY advice at all, no matter how relevant to the subject matter of my dissertation, would be greatly appreciated. Would also love to hear if anyone has any opinions on the \"flâneuse\", do you think she can exist?",

If it wasn't confusing enough, Jessie Coulson translates it as 'aesthetically speaking, I am a louse' (pg 233, Norton Critical Edition) - which changes things somewhat. I had a look at the Garnett translation which goes for 'aesthetic louse' as well.\n\nI thought 'atheistic' would be the best fit given the theme of atheism, as it were. Also, 'aesthetic' doesn't make much sense. Obviously am not a Russian speaker though. I had a quick look on Google and nothing came up to definitively settle the question. \n\nWhat do you fellows think?",
