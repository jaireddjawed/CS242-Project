School clubs don't actually do anything meaningful so that's not on the table. \n\nIf I were to attempt a project to aid local endangered or vulnerable species by myself, could you give me some advice on how to go through with it? Any personal stories or experience you can enlighten me with? \nAlthough I'm open to going solo, I would prefer to work under someone and learn from them. Unfortunately, I don't have many connections, and don't know who I would even ask. \n\nSo if you guys know any professionals or someone in the field that would be interested in picking up an intern/volunteer, please let me know with contact info. I do live in the Southern California region so they would have to be from the area. \n\n\n",

I'm not sure right now if I'd like to work in conservation full-time, as I believe the pay is not as good as a career in CS, and I don't want to start hating the work because of the low pay. But I'd like to know your thoughts on this and if my assumptions are not right. I may switch to conservation full-time once I know I'm comfortable and stable enough. \n\n\nHere are some questions I have:\n\n* Are there any open source projects I can contribute to?\n\n* What are the kinds of jobs in the field of conservation for Computer Science graduates? Are there any specific areas where CS skills are used?\n\n* Are there any master's degree programs you would suggest looking into?\n\n* Even if I do work in the field of Computer Science, in what ways can I help the effort of conservation?\n\n\nThanks.",
