        "text": "Entropy is defined as the amount of configurations a system can have. During the infancy of the universe, all particles were spread out and atoms did not form to create molecules yet. Atoms that form an apple for example is one of the particular states those atoms could have. If the atoms were rearranged so that something else was formed, the apple would not exist physically, but it could, given the atoms are arranged appropriately. Objects that consist of atoms depend on those atoms to be in a certain state to physically exist, so in one possible state the apple exists, but in another, it doesn't. Likewise, all matter is composed of these atoms. Roads, air, you and me.. Since the universe has high entropy, it has a lot of states that atoms and other particles could have arranged themselves in, and therefor form different objects, and people. Changing the state of an object doesn't mean that state is gone forever. Cream can un-mix from coffee for example, it's just statistically highly improbable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess what I'm asking is: Since certain macroscopic objects exist due to the state of the particles they consist of,  and you can change a state, but not destroy it, is it possible that even though our current universe is already in a particular state, is it possible that the state where the moon never formed due to the atoms that it consist of not arranging exists as a possible state as well, inducing a similar, but not the same universe?

        "text": "I'm an undergraduate at a US university with a very good physics program. My university offers the standard undergraduate physics curriculum at the level of Taylor for Mechanics and Griffiths for E&amp;M/QM. There are also plenty of electives/grad classes to the point where I will never be able to take everything I want to take.\n\nHowever, despite this, the physics curriculum feels...too abstract? I feel like I'm spending too much time chasing negative signs or solving long-winded integrals with idealized problems. I can solve for the E field of an infinite line of charge, but I can't tell you if 100 microFarads is a lot or a little.\n\nI don't think these problems are useless. In fact, I believe I've gained a lot from doing these problems. But there's only so much you can cover in an undergraduate degree, and I'm worried that there's a bit of an imbalance. Especially now with computer algebra systems, it does feel like a small waste of time to be learning to latest integral trick using some obscure trig identity.\n\nDimensional analysis and order-of-magnitude physics feel totally different. From what I understand, dimensional analysis deals with finding the relevant quantities/units of a problem to derive a physical relationship you want, often just by matching units. The hardest part is finding the relevant quantities, unlike a traditional textbook problem where the exact relevant information is given to you. (One example that I enjoy: the period of a simple pendulum must only depend on g, the gravitational acceleration, and L, the length. The units are \\[g\\]=length/time\\^2, \\[L\\]=length. The only way to combine these to get a period in units of time is sqrt(L/g). This is off by a constant factor, but we can see the period scales like sqrt(L) without doing any work.)\n\nOrder-of-magnitude physics seeks to find a quantitative estimate of difficult physical problems quickly.   Rather than finding an exact answer, you make educated guesses to get within an order of magnitude. (You might use this to answer the doors vs. wheels debate.)\n\nI've almost completed the core physics curriculum at my university, yet I have almost zero exposure to these subjects in the classroom. I'm interested to compare my experience with others, including those outside the US. Namely,\n\n* Did/does your undergraduate program teach you dimensional analysis/order-of-magnitude style reasoning? Did you have an elective on this material?\n* For those of you who know about physics pedagogy more than I do, why do we study physics the way we do now? Is there any interest in incorporating more of this style of reasoning?",

Using clutches you could any off three together. The motor could function as a starter, generator, or drive the compressor for cooling or small amount of heat off grid power.  You probably wouldn't want to run the engine when you want to cool the building but if the power is out...\n\nInside the duct the air would first go through a heat exchanger with the engines exhaust. A bypass valve would exist for when not wanting to generate heat. Then it would go through a radiator for the heat pump/ac. Finally it would go through a radiator that the engine coolant would go through. Just as before there also would be a radiator outside if not wanting to generate heat. An condenser would also be placed in the engine exhaust after the heat exchanger because it would most likely be warmer than the outside air. To my knowledge cold air makes engines generate more power but be less efficient so you would want to warm it and keep in mind we are extracting heat from the exhaust so hot exhaust is good. However I'm not going to design the plumbing in my head for that.\n\nSo that is the design. However I feel like this isn't more efficient because people don't do this. If there were reasonable gains of heat for the amount of gas used even small 10% may be worth maintaining an engine and all the valves and plumbing required. The only reasons I see for why this couldn't work are: Fuel not being burned - Possible but I think efficient engines burn most of the fuel. What might be the cause would be something with pressure, I don't know what with pressure could affect the heat produced but maybe it can decrease the heat generated. The constant starting and stopping of the engine and the required reliability doesn't seem like a problem that would completely invalidate this design. Just an engineering challenge.",

I know perfectly well what an electromagnetic field applied by communication devices is to the propagation of light. But  this electromagnetic wave that is always represented as a sinusoidal that propagates in the air, how does it propagate at the molecular level? Let me explain: what happens to the molecules when this field passes? Because it has always seemed to me too abstract a concept to represent these waves with the sinusoidal traveling in the air, I would like to understand in a concrete way what really happens in the propagation of this phenomenon.

        "text": "Calling all physicists(theoretical or otherwise), chemists, biologists, geniuses, math wizards, and those with a mind for dissecting abstraction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have no choice but to start over, our physics models do not accurately represent reality. We have been trotting along knowing our theories are \"incomplete\", coming to grand conclusions without first having a solid foundation. There are numerous problems in both quantum mechanics and relativity that are well known we need to stop ignoring them, they require being rectified at the foundational level before we can make true progress. These are mistakes baked into the foundations halting all attempts at unification, we have to gut it, come together and start over.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDark matter/energy represent the difference between prediction and observation, we ignored the proof we we're wrong and doubled down folding them into the problem. If Einstein or Newton nailed gravity we wouldn't need dark matter to make up the difference in galactic behavior. It's been a century since the inception of the electron and photon, and over half a century for quarks and the rest of the standard model, Quarks have still not been liberated. No particle has ever been directly observed. All the particles rely solely on \"inference\" which is NOT evidence, this is a fancy word for confirmation bias, a preconceived notion of corpuscles leaning on a charge to mass ratio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeal states; are not useful they are the only thing hindering us, imaginary starting points within the math that have no grounding in reality. The \"inertial frame\", \"ideal gas law\", and the \"perfect vacuum\" are remnants of thought experiments poisoning the well. Time has never stopped to observe an inertial frame, frame dragging is unfounded. The \"ideal gas law\" is hiding mass in the mole unit treating all nuclear entities as equal when combinations ought to be considered greater than the sum. The \"perfect vacuum\" has not been achieved, all attempts structurally fail, we have NEVER isolated \"light\" or \"energy\" outside the medium of atoms, the medium has only been observed to be atomic. Everything happening between those collider detectors is an atomic impact proxy only, the proton has not been broken down, any \"inference\" suggesting smaller interactions is mistaken. Smashing unbreakable marbles together and observing the resulting spins and interactions does not require the invention of a new particle every decade, the particles are misinterpretations. There is no missing piece we overcomplicated the entire matter by subdividing one too many times, requiring us to jump through hoops in order to make the ideas work. These result in several logical workarounds such as probability, uncertainty, and as we extrapolate we are constantly required to make larger and longer logical bridges to cover the chasm our sinking foundations have created. The logic the math is based on is clearly flawed, or we would have answers. There is no zero in mass, there is no zero in time, there is no zero - hard stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe medium has only been observed as atomic, the answer has been staring us in the face the entire time. Light and energy are attributes of the atoms themselves, Kinetic energy, motion of mass. The atoms are already moving the speed of light in kinetic energy transfer the frequency of which is determined by the mass of the atoms in interaction, the atoms are the \"space\" and they move with the electromagnetic force as kinetic energy. The idea of electromagnetic \"fields\" needs to be adjusted to understand it's the atoms themselves that create the sphere of influence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhysical interaction, light is a displacement wave in the medium of atoms, created when combinations are made or separated. Both light and Gravity operate under an inverse square law, that is the key, a single impact between atoms(spheres), straight lines of force pyramid geometry to the opposite side of the sphere, 4 contact points with neighboring atoms 1:4. This takes place in both vectors simultaneously. Light and gravity are one, crest and trough of a physical displacement wave, propagating as single interactions between atoms cascading, equal and opposite, which has to overcome the momentum and mass of the atom being hit(photo electric effect requiring force/ and the source of electrical resistance) a physical reset of the atom, reciprocal in motion, simultaneously felt by all atoms in interaction(can't punch something without hurting your hand). Light is Gravity. Heat waves from the core pull us down, and somehow we overlooked the \"INDUCTION\" of the compass needle, which can be upscaled to useable electricity. LIGHT IS GRAVITY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou're going to need a geometry based math, which accounts for the atom moving the speed of light in reciprocal motion. An optical illusion of the atom standing still in the middle of it's effective kinetic range exerting itself in 3d as the \"space\", a kinetic range that increases the more energy is added to the system, so it travels further the bigger it is and the harder it's hit giving us a wide range of frequencies for each atom, and physical properties as the complexity of their interactions increases in combination(they get knobby and tumble). Remember there is no zero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo have at it, make your mark, write the math, fix our physics and end the energy crisis... Also when we identify the frequency responsible for all \"Brownian motion\" perpendicular to the surface, we can match it and push off as like charges, grind off the sphere of influence like Earth does with the Sun, so there is some fun and games at the end of the day. We have to stop what we are doing and fix this, bio and chem will make sense, and we can truly make progress. This is the truth. Drop your egos and get to fucking work",

Will we discover previously undiscovered physics by removing time from the equation? And replace it with something else, like causality?",
