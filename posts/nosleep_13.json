        "text": " Chapter 1: The Journey Begins\n\nJacob had always been fascinated by the idea of visiting Antarctica. As a child, he had spent hours poring over books and documentaries about the icy continent, dreaming of the day when he could set foot on its frozen shores. And now, as a college sophomore, he was finally fulfilling his lifelong dream.\n\nHe had saved up enough money to book a spot on a research vessel, which would take him to the far reaches of the globe. The ship, the SS Valiant, was a massive steel behemoth, bristling with all manner of scientific equipment and manned by a crew of seasoned explorers.\n\nAs he boarded the ship, Jacob felt a thrill of excitement mixed with trepidation. The crew was friendly enough, but there was a coldness to their demeanor that Jacob found unsettling. They moved about the ship with the brisk efficiency of people who had seen too much, done too much, and had grown numb to the world's wonders.\n\nJacob settled into his cabin, which was small but comfortable, and gazed out the porthole at the vast expanse of the ocean. He had never felt so alone, so isolated from the rest of humanity. But there was also a sense of freedom, of possibility, that he had never experienced before.\n\nAs the ship set sail, Jacob found himself drawn into the rhythms of life on board. He rose early, ate breakfast in the mess hall, and spent hours exploring the various rooms and laboratories that dotted the ship. He talked to the crew, asked them questions about their work and their experiences, and tried to soak up as much knowledge as he could.\n\nBut there was always something gnawing at the back of his mind, a sense that something was not quite right. He couldn't put his finger on it, but there was a tension in the air, a sense of unease that he couldn't shake.\n\nAnd then, one night, he overheard a conversation between two crew members that sent shivers down his spine. They were speaking in hushed tones, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of a cigarette. Jacob couldn't make out everything they were saying, but he caught snippets of words - \"dangerous,\" \"secret,\" \"unpredictable.\"\n\nHe tried to brush it off, to tell himself that it was just his imagination playing tricks on him. But the unease only grew stronger, until it became a weight on his chest that he couldn't ignore.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and as the ship made its way deeper into the icy waters, the crew's behavior grew more and more erratic. They spoke in hushed tones, cast furtive glances in Jacob's direction, and seemed to be hiding something from him.\n\nJacob tried to ignore his growing sense of unease, but it gnawed at him like a persistent itch. He began to explore the ship more often, hoping to find some clue as to what was going on. He crept through the dimly lit corridors, peered into the labs, and eavesdropped on conversations whenever he could.\n\nBut the more he learned, the more confused he became. There were whispers of experiments gone wrong, of dangerous creatures being kept in the bowels of the ship. There were rumors of mutiny, of a crew that had lost its way and was now adrift in a sea of madness.\n\nJacob couldn't make sense of it all. He didn't know who to trust, who to turn to for help. And as they neared Antarctica, the skies grew darker and the temperature dropped to bone-chilling levels. Jacob wrapped himself in layers of thick clothing and gloves, but still, he couldn't shake the feeling of icy fingers brushing against his skin. He tried to calm himself by taking deep breaths and focusing on the task at hand, but it was becoming more and more difficult.\n\nOn the third day of their journey, Jacob saw something in the distance - a dark shape on the horizon. As they drew closer, he could see that it was a research station, its metal walls gleaming in the pale sunlight. But there was something off about the station, something that sent shivers down Jacob's spine.\n\nThe crew docked the ship and disembarked, leaving Jacob alone on the deck. He could hear strange noises coming from the station - a low, guttural growling that made his blood run cold. But when he asked the crew about it, they dismissed his concerns and told him it was probably just the wind.\n\nThat night, Jacob found himself unable to sleep. He tossed and turned in his bunk, listening to the creaking of the ship and the howling of the wind. And then, he heard something else - a scratching sound, like something was trying to claw its way into his cabin.\n\nHe sat up, heart pounding in his chest. The scratching grew louder, more insistent. He realized that it was coming from the door.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, he got out of bed and crept towards the door. He peered through the peephole and saw something that made his blood run cold - a pair of glowing eyes, shining in the darkness like twin orbs of fire.",

        "text": "Ok I'm pretty confused but I have insomnia as a result of today so I'm pretty sure I'm posting in the right place. \n\nAnyone who knows about legal stuff in New England and/or Kentucky or international law about British citizens inheriting - probably inheriting at any rate - from an American citizen then please feel free to tell me what I've missed. Or y'know, suggestions for tourist things to do in Salem at the weekend, that'd be good too.\n\nI got a whole lot of missed calls last month but no answerphone messages that I could follow - lots of white noise and barely audible whispers. Now I think they were from the Attorney's office in Salem but mullered by international phone lines and the fact that my mobile never gets good signal in my house. To be fair given the amount of legalese I've heard I'm not sure I'd have followed what was said even if I had taken the calls.\n\nApparently I need to be in Salem on Saturday for a Will Reading in order to inherit.  Is that an American thing? I'm pretty sure you don't need to attend a will reading to inherit in the U.K. I know Dad had relatives in the US but I checked with my sister and my Mum and we're sure they were in Kentucky. But Dad died a few years ago and he wasn't on speaking terms with the Kentucky family, I don't think it was a row, I think it was just that way that sometimes people lose touch. Much less deliberate than the cousins who went to Australia with a whole lot of money they'd taken from Great Aunty Peggy, no one wanted to speak to them. Huh, maybe this is a scam? I don't have any money though so I don't think it can be a good one if it is.\nOk what scams involve buying a plane ticket for a random Brit to go to Salem?\n\nThe attorney's office got through this morning, I connected the landline for the first time since lockdown and it rang almost immediately. It was quite weird because my Mum has that number and my Grandma before she died but no one bothers with landlines anymore so I wasn't expecting the American accent. He told me he needed me to be in attendance on Saturday or they couldn't proceed, something to do with the needs of the blood or bloodlines I guess. Kentucky isn't KKK country or anything is it? Am I going to get to New England and suddenly get the worst kind of racist relatives in my face? \n\nWhen I told them I couldn't get to America they said they'd send me a ticket because this needs must be done before the waxing crescent is over. Which I think means there must be something about the moon phase in the will. Dad's cousins must've been really weird is all I can think - maybe they knew I was into Wicca when I was a teenager so that's why they've left me something. They asked if I had a lawyer here in the U.K. for them to correspond with in the event of my misfortune - I said not but that my sister was my next of kin. I don't think that was what they wanted really because then they asked a whole lot about when she was born - even the time! They said they needed to consult the ephemeris which is some kind of legal book I'm guessing. In anycase the upshot was that I needed to get on a plane and go to Salem and provide them with a lawyer to correspond with once I got there. I'm still not sure why I need to have a lawyer. So any ideas? I'm going to go out into town tomorrow to see if any of the law offices there will let me give their names to the American guys when I get there.\n\nMaybe I'm going to meet some long lost family too... not sure how I feel about that, bit nerve wracking really especially given that Cousin Kenny had choice things to say about everyone of the international family who didn't come to Dad's funeral. I think that the Aussies got \"bloody g---o scam artists\" and the Yanks got \"deathless bloodsucking husks\" - yeah I guess I don't need to go to the US to meet racist family. I think Kenny especially hated that he had to be polite to the French cousins because they attended the funeral. He bitched about their pale makeup even so, I think he prefers fake tan - he does live in Liverpool.\n\nRight, I need to try and sleep, I guess I'm just hoping it's not all one big scam, I should probably look up the weird legal terms they keep using just to check. Tomorrow I need to get a lawyer and then attend upon the offices in Salem for the will reading or what in American legal speak is \"the blood attending upon the compact.\"",

        "text": "Excuse how bad my writing is I've never been someone that was good at telling stories but anyways. A couple of years ago in October my parents and I went down to my grandfather's beach house in North Carolina for my birthday.\n\n His house was always my favorite to visit because it was secluded from the town and had a beautiful dock that looked out into the water. After 8 hours or so of driving we arrived at his house, it was fairly late so we all said our quick hellos and went to bed. \n\nI passed out almost immediately but was awoken from a weird sound outside my room at the ungodly hour of 2am, I didn't think much of it and just figured it was my Grandpa's old dog. 20 minutes passed and I couldn't fall back asleep to save my life, so I thought \"fuck it. \" and grabbed my bag and walked out to the dock.\n\n It was pitch black, chilly but not too bad and all I could hear was crickets and of course, the water splashing up against the dock and my grandpa's boat. I sat down at the very end, played Billy Idol on my phone and began rolling and smoking a jo!nt.\n\n After a couple of puffs I was hardcore spacing out gazing into the dark water in front of me, I don't remember what I was thinking about but I was vibing until I quickly snapped out of it when I noticed a dark mass pass by in the water in front of me, too small to be a shark but to big to be any regular fish.\n\n I had always been afraid of the ocean so it creeped me out a good bit, but I ended up convincing myself it was the weed even though I didn't feel high.\n\n A couple of minutes passed and I started to feel paranoid it felt like someone or something was watching me and I kept seeing moving in the water in my peripherals. I decided I finally had enough and was way too fucked up to be out there.\n\n So I started packing everything back into my bag and as soon as I turned off the music I noticed that it was quieter than before, the crickets seemed to have disappeared and the water was weirdly still.\n\n I remember mumbling \"fuck this\" and got up. what I saw a couple feet out in the water in front of me I will never forget. It was a head submerged up to its eyes, the dim lighting from the dock illuminating it slightly.\n\n I stood there frozen in fear, unable to fully process what I was seeing. It had the appearance of a man, with dark long hair, and strong intense eyes. I was unable to move it felt like I was in a trance, keeping my eyes locked with it's. Every possible thought and explanation ran through my head all at once, and just like a white dumbass in a horror movie I muttered \"hello?\"\n\n It then began to lift it's head out of the water revealing the rest of it's face and without breaking eye contact it whispered \"hello.\" back to me. I ran to the house as fast as I could, I was losing my mind I didn't even know how I managed to fall asleep that night. For days I was trying to figure out if it was a dream? or hallucination?, but I could remember every detail. \n\nAnd the craziest part is that I've never stopped seeing it. I see it every time I visit. I see it in my dreams, and my nightmares. I know the majority of you aren't going to believe me and I really don't blame you, I wouldn't believe me either.\n\n Everyone I've told this story too either didn't believe me or told me what I saw was a mermaid, like ariel type shit. But it felt dark, and unfriendly, yet aluring?\n\n Has anyone experienced this before? Down in the East coast specifically? I just want an explanation. But thank you for reading, if you've had any experiences similar to this or any information please let me know.",

        "text": "Hey everyone. This is my first time posting on Reddit, but one of my friends told me I should post here to see if anyone else has gone through a similar experience. I'm posting this on a throwaway account to preserve my anonymity. This is going to be long, so bear with me.\n\nFor context: I (21M) am a college student at a university in a rural area in the South, so nothing like this ever happens here. My university requires that everyone lives on campus, which is weird, I know, so all of my friends and I live within a five minutes walk of each other. Most of my friends are seniors, so they live in a separate dorm that's across campsu from me.\n\nThis past weekend, I was at a party - it was just a casual dorm party, and as the night's winding down I decide to head back to my own room, since it's such a short walk and I always prefer to sleep in my own bed. I'm walking out of my friends' dorm, shivering because the cold front had just come through and I hadn't brought a jacket to the party, when I see a man, standing against the wall of the dorm. \n\nThere wasn't any light out, so I couldn't see his face, but I could see that his body was tilted towards me. Now, normally I wouldn't think anything of this, there's always people walking around on my campus and it was a Friday night, so I would expect people to be out, plus I had admittedly had a little too much to drink, but what stopped me was the fact that this man did not move at all. I even stumbled, half from the booze and half from the fright that he had given me, and he just stood there, without movign. I shook my head, trying to convince myself that he was just another drunken person who had locked himself out of the building by accident, so I held the door open for him - stupid of me, I know, but I thought he was a student - but he did not move from the wall. \n\n\"Whatever,\" I said, probably loudly enough for him to hear considering the amount of alcohol I had drank, and I let the door close and began walking back to my dorm. As I opened the door to my building, I looked back and my heart stopped. In the darkness, just outside of the light from the streetlamps, the man was standing there. I still couldn't see his face, but I knew it was the same man. I quickly shut the door, and when I reached the elevator, I turned around again and screamed. The man reached the door, and he was stanidng right outside of it, his hand pressed against the glass, but his face was still hidden in shadow. When the elevator doors opened, I rushed inside and up to my room, and I tried to forget the whole thing had happened.\n\nThe next morning, Saturday, I got breakfast with my boyfriend, who we'll call James (20M). We've been dating for about 3 months, but I still wasn't sure if we were close enough for me to tell him about what had happened to me last night without him thinking that I was crazy. Eventually, I worked up the courage to tell him, and his jaw dropped. James, since he was young, has always had pretty bad nightmares, but recently I've noticed that they've gotten really bad. \n\nI'd tried to talk to him about them, to see what was wrong, but he only shook his head every time I brought it up, and I didn't want to push him. After I finished telling him this story, however, he told me that the same exact thing had happened to him, two weeks ago, as he was walking back to the dorm with his late-night McDonalds. He had seen a random person outside of the parking garage, but he hadn't been able to see his face, and when he had gotten to his dorm he had seen the same man once again right outside. This is what he had been having nightmares about - the man with the black hole for a face, getting closer and closer to him.\n\nI managed to push it out of my mind, to tell myself that the strange man I had seen the night before and the man from James's nightmares was all a one-time thing, until Monday night. I had an exam on Tuesday morning, so I was up late studying in the library. For some reason, the library here closes at midnight, and I lost track of time until 11:50, when the library assistant came to me and told me I had to leave in the next 10 minutes. I walked out just as the lights to the library were shutting, and when I walked out, I saw him. \n\nOnce again, he was sitting on the wall, but this time, as soon as I walked out he stood up and began to walk towards me. I ran. Anyone who's ever toured a college campus knows they always tell you about the blue lights, which you can press to call the campus police, and that you can supposedly see from any point on campus. This is not true: I was running and I didn't see anything, but I could hear his feet behind me. I screamed out for help, but with the cold everyone was already inside their dorms for the night; there was no one but me and the man chasing me. \n\nBy some miracle, I reached my dorm before him and shut the door in his face, but once again his hands slammed against the door as soon as I had closed it, though he kept his face just far enough out of the lights for me to see it. The next morning, on Tuesday, I called campus police. I told them the situation, and I asked them to help me, but they said that, without any proof, there was nothing I could do. I tried to explain to them that I had seen this man twice already around campus, but they just told me to be careful and to let them know if anything else came up.\n\nI haven't been able to sleep well since then, but thankfully, I only have one class on Wednesday, so after that ended I shut myself in my room and tried to distract myself by playing video games. James came over around 9 last night and we fell asleep together, without any sign of the Shadow Man (this is what we've started calling him). This morning, Thursday, was when it got the worst. I'm normally an early riser, but I woke up at 10am to James shaking me awake, asking me why I was still asleep. I had slept through my first two classes of the day. \n\nThis is unheard of for me - I always wake up to my first alarm at 7am, but just in case I sleep through it, I set about thirty different alarms each night to make sure. I opened my phone, confused, and saw that all of the alarms had been turned off. I didn't know how this could have happened, and as I was trying to figure it out, I saw that my room was a total mess. All my clothes were laying on the floor, and the picture I keep on my desk - which is of me and James at our one month anniversary - was missing, the frame empty. I got out of bed and went to take a picture of the room to use as evidence, and when I looked at it in my phone gallery, my heart stopped. \n\nBefore the picture I had just taken, there were about 10 new photos: all of them of James and me asleep together. The time stamp said they had been taken at 6:37, right after the sun had risen today. I don't normally lock my door - again, I know, this is dumb of me, but we're in the rural south - so anyone could have gotten in, but I immediately knew it was him.\n\nAfter James managed to get me to calm down enough to show him the photos, I called campus police again and went to their office in person. After begging them to help me, they finally looked at the security footage from last night. They didn't let me see anything, but after only about ten minutes they came back and told me that they didn't have any footage from last night. For some reason, the cameras had stopped working. \n\nI knew exactly what had happened, but I could tell they thought I was making everything up. I even showed them the picture I had taken, of the mess in my room, and of the picture of James and me sleeping together in my bed, but they just said they could not prove who had taken those pictures or who had made the mess in my room. They just told me to make sure I locked my door at night and then sent me out of the office.\n\nI have no idea what to do. Campus police obviously isn't going to do anything. Can someone please give me advice on what to do? Has this happened to anyone else before?",

They didn't let me see anything, but after only about ten minutes they came back and told me that they didn't have any footage from last night. For some reason, the cameras had stopped working. I knew exactly what had happened, but I could tell they thought I was making everything up. I even showed them the picture I had taken, of the mess in my room, and of the picture of James and me sleeping together in my bed, but they just said they could not prove who had taken those pictures or who had made the mess in my room. They just told me to make sure I locked my door at night and then sent me out of the office. \n\nI have no idea what to do. Campus police obviously isn't going to do anything. Can someone please give me advice on what to do? Has this happened to anyone else before?",

        "text": "This happened to one of my brothers on a wilderness survival excursion last year.\n\nWe were camping together at a very popular campsite in the mountains in Virginia—my brothers, me, my dad, and a few of our friends. It was somewhat of a tradition in our family to spend one night out of the week at a slightly more remote site a few miles away from base camp, where you didn’t bring a tent and had to build your own shelter then find your way back to base camp in the morning. I had done this two years ago with some friends, my older brothers each did it a few years earlier, and my dad was always super conscious of making sure we were well prepared. He just wanted us to have a good time and be “one with nature.” Y’all know what I mean.\n\nSo this year it’s my younger brother’s turn (let’s call him Dan), and he and his friend (let’s call him Ricky) are getting ready for their wilderness survival night. Of course, they’re practicing all their skills and showing off, classic Boy Scout shit like tying knots, building fires, whittling. They’re arrogant teenagers, so they’re bragging about how they’re gonna find an even more remote site than usual, and we think they’re full of shit.\n\nThe night comes that they plan to hike to their other site and they get there and set up a little lean-to all according to plan. They’ve got their fire, enough food and water to last the night, everything we prepared in advance. Then they go to sleep. At around 2 in the morning, Ricky wakes Dan up because there’s a sound like footsteps around their shelter. They’re in the Smokies, so of course their first worry is bears. But all their food is tied up in a bear bag so they think they’ll be fine.\n\nRicky sits up and looks out into the darkness and says he sees a guy at the tree line of the campsite. Dan looks too and also sees him. At this point they can’t tell whether to be relieved—no bear—or even more scared—no one else knows where they are except my dad with the map and the plans. So who is this guy? The two of them can’t tell what’s going on with this rando until he turns around and is carrying a fucking axe. They can’t see his face, but he’s wearing all black, swinging this axe around, and ambling toward the shelter at a really casual pace.\n\nNow they’re thoroughly freaked, because the only weapons they brought with them are pocketknives, and no way are they gonna be able to fend off this guy with his axe. Something’s unusual about the way this guy is shuffling toward the shelter though, almost like he doesn’t see it, or doesn’t see Dan and Ricky, so they think okay let’s just keep quiet and hide and see what happens.\n\nGuy keeps walking toward their shelter with his axe, still doesn’t see them, and stops directly in front of their fire, which is basically just coals now because it’s the middle of the night. He sits down for a few minutes and Dan and Ricky are scared shitless. They’re thinking it’s two on one, maybe they can rush him with the pocketknives and take him, but something’s stopping them from trying. Then axe guy gets up, walks over to the shelter, and looks directly at Dan through a hole between the branches in the wall. They make eye contact. Then he turns around and slowly shuffles away out of the campsite, just like how he came in.\n\nDan and Ricky immediately packed up their stuff and headed back to the main campsite, even though it was the middle of the night—which was really stupid, we told them. But they made it back and we never heard anything about the guy with the axe, not even from the park ranger.\n\nAnyone know anything about cryptids or ghosts in the Smokies? We’re not from there so we have no clue who Dan and Ricky might have seen or if this is part of the ghost lore of the area. Maybe just some creep in the woods with an axe…",

        "text": "Excuse how bad my writing is I've never been someone that was good at telling stories but anyways. A couple of years ago in October my parents and I went down to my grandfather's beach house in North Carolina for my birthday. His house was always my favorite to visit because it was secluded from the town and had a beautiful dock that looked out into the water. After 8 hours or so of driving we arrived at his house, it was fairly late so we all said our quick hellos and went to bed.\n\n I passed out almost immediately but was awoken from a weird sound outside my room at the ungodly hour of 2am, I didn't think much of it and just figured it was my Grandpa's old dog. 20 minutes passed and I couldn't fall back asleep to save my life, so I thought \"fuck it. \" and grabbed my bag and walked out to the dock. It was pitch black, chilly but not too bad and all I could hear was crickets and of course, the water splashing up against the dock and my grandpa's boat. I sat down at the very end, played Billy Idol on my phone and began rolling and smoking a jo!nt. After a couple of puffs I was hardcore spacing out gazing into the dark water in front of me, I don't remember what I was thinking about but I was vibing until I quickly snapped out of it when I noticed a dark mass pass by in the water in front of me, too small to be a shark but to big to be any regular fish. \n\nI had always been afraid of the ocean so it creeped me out a good bit, but I ended up convincing myself it was the weed even though I didn't feel high. A couple of minutes passed and I started to feel paranoid it felt like someone or something was watching me and I kept seeing moving in the water in my peripherals. I decided I finally had enough and was way too fucked up to be out there. So I started packing everything back into my bag and as soon as I turned off the music I noticed that it was quieter than before, the crickets seemed to have disappeared and the water was weirdly still. I remember mumbling \"fuck this\" and got up. what I saw a couple feet out in the water in front of me I will never forget. It was a head submerged up to its eyes, the dim lighting from the dock illuminating it slightly.\n\n I stood there frozen in fear, unable to fully process what I was seeing. It had the appearance of a man, with dark long hair, and strong intense eyes. I was unable to move it felt like I was in a trance, keeping my eyes locked with it's. Every possible thought and explanation ran through my head all at once, and just like a white dumbass in a horror movie I muttered \"hello?\" It then began to lift it's head out of the water revealing the rest of it's face and without breaking eye contact it whispered \"hello.\" back to me. I ran to the house as fast as I could, I was losing my mind I didn't even know how I managed to fall asleep that night. For days I was trying to figure out if it was a dream? or hallucination?, but I could remember every detail. \n\nAnd the craziest part is that I've never stopped seeing it. I see it every time I visit. I see it in my dreams, and my nightmares. I know the majority of you aren't going to believe me and I really don't blame you, I wouldn't believe me either. Everyone I've told this story too either didn't believe me or told me what I saw was a mermaid, like ariel type shit. But it felt dark, and unfriendly, yet aluring? Has anyone experienced this before? Down in the East coast specifically? I just want an explanation. But thank you for reading, if you've had any experiences similar to this or any information please let me know.",

        "text": "I'm a first grade teacher at a school where a lot of our students come and go from week to week. The city I'm from sees a lot of immigrants so we have many students touch base at our school and move away when they end up in a more permanent home. Last week Monday, I was told a new student would be joining my class. I didn't think anything of it because, like I said, I get new students all the time. I asked if we know anything about them, and my principal told me there was no file for her at all, but her name was Yulia. \n\nYulia joined our class just like every other student. I paired her up with a more talkative classmate with the hopes that she would acclimate well to the classroom. She was a pretty quiet kid, but I didn't think much of that. By the Tuesday, I noticed she was whispering to James, one of my students, on the playground. After a few minutes, James approached me and asked to go to the nurse, claiming his head was suddenly hurting. He ended up going home early. \n\nWednesday, right before dismissal, Yulia was standing in front of my desk, looking at me with a blank stare. I asked her if she was alright, and she just started whispering gibberish. When I asked her to speak up, she began to whisper louder, still speaking nonsense, except this time I heard her say the name of one of my students, Piper. \n\nBy Friday, Yulia was absent and I was told she moved away. \n\nWell, fast forward to this week, we are watching a video on the carpet, and I hear a shriek from the bathroom within my classroom. I pause the video and practically sprint to the bathroom. By the time I get to the other side of the classroom, Piper had opened the door and was hysterical. When I finally got her to speak, she said Yulia's name and pointed to the bathroom mirror. \n\nI peeked in and obviously there was nothing in there, but I sent Piper to the nurse just to be safe. It was a bit of a chaotic rest of the day, so I didn't get the chance to do any more investigating.\n\nWell, this morning, I get to my classroom early, so I decide to scope out the bathroom, thinking maybe there was a bug or something that had scared Piper. But, as I go to open the door, it's locked from the inside. Obviously, I'm a little freaked out by this, but I just let it go and call the janitor to open the door with the master key when he gets the chance. \n\nin classic janitor fashion, he didn't end up coming today, but out of curiosity, I jigged the handle right before I left, and it opened perfectly fine. When I stepped inside, though, it was burning hot in there, and as I walked around I saw chunks of black hair on the floor like someone had gone crazy with the safety scissors in here. I was almost pissed that one of my kids had given themselves a haircut, but then I remembered that Yulia had black hair, and I just got the hell out of there. \n\nI'm scared to go back tomorrow. Updates to come.",

        "text": "I'll preface this by saying I don't believe in ghosts. None of that supernatural stuff. I'm a person of science, and if you can see it, there's an explanation for it. It just happens to be that I haven't found an explanation for this one yet.\n\nIt was the middle of the night, maybe 2 AM or so, and my phone started buzzing. I was waiting on a response from a job interview, so even though I didn't recognize the number, I picked it up. Now, you might ask, what kind of an employer calls back at 2 AM? I have no idea. It was 2 AM, and I was sleep addled, and there are time differences, and mostly I was really desperate for this job. So I answered, and I said, \"Hello?\" And a woman started responding, with a thick, accented voice, speaking really quickly, but it was all in a language I didn't understand. I speak a decent amount of Arabic and I took Spanish in high school and I spent the summer backpacking Europe, so I'm not pretending to be multilingual or anything, but I've heard a lot of foreign languages before. This woman didn't sound like she was speaking in any of them. I figured it was a prank call or a wrong number and I hung up.\n\nThe next night, around the same time, the phone rang again with the same number, and again, I picked it up. The same thing happened, but this time, I blocked it. I was a college student. I didn't need any unnecessary phone calls interrupting what little sleep I was getting.\n\nBut the next night, the phone rang again. And it was the same number. I didn't even understand how that was possible. I picked it up, confused, checking my Blocked list to see if I had somehow deleted it. The number was still Blocked. The woman started talking again, and I said, \"Excuse me, but I think you have the wrong number. I'm going to have to ask you to please stop calling.\"\n\nAnd the woman screamed into the phone, at the top of her lungs, a violent, wordless, blood-chilling howl. I jolted and dropped the phone, scrambling to pick it up and end the call, but right before I could, she said in perfect English, \"I'm watching you, Sarah.\"\n\nI was scared shitless. I left my phone in my room and went down the hall to my boyfriend's apartment. My heart was pounding out of my chest. Nobody called me Sarah except for my grandmother, and she had died years ago. I went into his room and woke him up, insistent that I didn't want to sleep alone that night. Now, I hadn't mentioned any of these phone calls to him, or to anybody else. But as soon as I shook him awake, he sat up in bed, eyes wide and breathing heavy. He told me had just a horrible dream about me. I asked him what it was, and he said, \"There was a woman standing over you with a knife. She spoke really fast, in a different language, and she was going to kill you. She kept calling you Sarah.\"",

        "text": "My daughter is 22 now and I am so guilty for the way I treated her. Her dad left us when she was a baby, and as a young mom in her 20’s I didn’t want or have the ability to care for her the way I should have. \n\nI used to leave her in the living room at night time while she was a baby while I would have sex with men. I would smack her as a toddler and pull her hair. I let one of my ex boyfriends bring his dog over even tho she would get asthma attacks and break out in hives. She had to go to the hospital, but after I still let him come over with the dog because I wanted the company. I didn’t do anything when my other ex boyfriend grabbed her arm a few times. I would scream and yell at her at 2 years old and leave her in a dark hallway at night until she banged on the front door for her grandmother in fear. \n\nAs she got older, I ended up treating her worse. I would pull her hair so hard, her head would have a lump. I would monitor how often she showered , and I would hide most of the food in my bedroom closet. I would yell and scream at her for sneaking food. I didn’t let her use any appliances. I wouldn’t let her shower whenever she pleased. And would only let her bathe for a few min. I let my mother buy her what she needed like bras. Soap. Personal items. I wasn’t made to be a mother. I neglected her. I let her have lice in her hair and didn’t help her. The bugs were crawling all over her face. I made her sleep and eat on the floor so she wouldn’t mess up the furniture. She would say how bad her back hurt but I didn’t care. \n\nI told her about my sex life. Shook my boobs and danced provocatively as a joke because I am a nymphomanic. She’s seen porn on my computer. Disgusting messages. I told her things I shouldn’t have. Like the number of sexual partners, what I did in college, dick sizes.  \n\nShe had a rabbit and I didn’t let her take it out of her cage. I have OCD and didn’t want it to make a mess everywhere. Over time, I wouldn’t let her put it in her room so I put the rabbit in a dark laundry room and removed the lamp so it sat in darkness 24:7. I didn’t want to pay for the light bill. She had to beg my mom to get it food. Then I killed it by accident because it was so dirty from its filth, I gave it a bath with a hose and it had a seizure and died. I didn’t know rabbits would die from being wet. I remember her screaming and yelling and I was too busy fighting with my boyfriend at the time. \n\nI would tell her disgusting things. Call her fat. Say she had a balloon face. A loser. Tell her “that’s why you have no friends at school “ “that’s why your dad left you” I also told her I wish I never fucked her dad. She was between 8-12. \n\n\nOne time, when I was having a stressful day, she was always defiant. And put a chocolate bar in my thanksgiving turkey. I was so angry I took mayonnaise and shoved it in her face. Up her nose. Down her throat. Until she threw up and cried. She always had a sensitivity with mayonnaise since she was a toddler, and I would sometimes use it to threaten her as punishment. Now she eats like a child, and has a fear of foods. \n\nWhen she ended up cutting herself, I didn’t get her help. I didn’t let her see a doctor when she had strep throat , and she almost died of an asthma attack because I was too tired to be bothered in the middle of the night. I told her to call the ambulance herself. But then followed her to the hospital. \n\nI didn’t let her get a license or a permit or a bank account because I didn’t want to be responsible for her reckless behavior. \n\nShe ended up getting sexually abused @ 14 by her music teacher who’s 23. She told me they just kissed. So I messaged him and told him to stop talking to her. He didn’t. And I found out recently it was way more than what she told me. I broke down in tears from the guilt. \n\nOnce she was about 15-16 she was running away and drinking and I just gave up on her and counted the days until she was 18 so she wasn’t my responsibility anymore. She felt the same. \n\nI told her to go live with another family member when she was 17. All she did was smoke weed and not listen or follow my rules. I have heard from her maybe 3 times\n\nI love my daughter. I feel guilty but she never wants to speak to me again. I thought since I never sexually abused her or beat her until she had bruises, it wasn’t abuse. I made mistakes. She now struggles with substance abuse issues. But Is a kind and empathetic person. She’d give the shirt off her back for anybody. She was just so hyper and bratty. And a hard kid. Maybe because of her ADHD. And I never wanted to be a mother.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI have never spoken to anyone about this, and I’d never imagined I’d grow some balls and type it out for the whole world to read.  Something happened to me back in 1981 (when I was considerably younger). I was working as a supply clerk at the local hospital when something occurred that still gives me nightmares to this day. \n\nI was working in the basement when the power went out. I was taking inventory of some sample vials, when I was bathed in darkness without warning. I called out to my supervisor, but the only thing that answered me was silence. \n\nMy first three months at that hospital had been tumultuous to say the least. Alcoholics who had come in looking for a fight, addicts who had fallen off the wagon, and teens who had tried to get out of their abusive households by cutting themselves out of the picture. Emotions were always at a high, and the number of staff was way too low to accommodate the growing population of the area. The power going out was one of the least concerning things that could have happened. \n\nI remember grabbing a flashlight from the mandatory Workplace Safety cabinet and I ventured into the hallway to find someone who knew what was going on, and hopefully when the power was going to return.\n\nI hadn’t noticed any damage until I climbed the stairway to the first floor. The hallways of the hospital were left littered with all sorts of debris. Medical equipment lay cracked open on the floor, beds lay unkempt in the hallway, and there was a strange wet sound of which I couldn’t quite place the origin of. I wondered to myself what may have happened in the short few hours that I had been gone, and where all of the patients had been moved to in such a hurry. \n\nA large gust swept over the hallway, and I was nearly knocked off of my feet. That’s when I noticed the noise. The clattering of objects and slamming of cabinet doors echoed from far down the hallway. It was getting closer, I had no clue what to expect. \n\nWhat little light was left in the hallway began to fade. The wind grew stronger, and the room grew darker. The noise was deafening when I had decided to run away, nearly tripping over the mess that filled the hallway. \n\nI reached the end of the hall, and turned toward the cafeteria. I carried on through the sturdy double-doors as the din behind me swallowed the hallway, the coarse wind bit at my ears and screamed into my bones. The tempest was so powerful that as I unlatched the fire doors, they opened instantly and were blown flat against the walls as if they were made of paper. \n\nI could find no shelter except for the small walk-in refrigerator that was in the kitchen. I could still hear things being thrown around outside the heavy steel door, but I decided to take a breath and figure out how to get to safety. \n\nThe easiest way to get out of the hospital from the cafeteria was through the emergency wing. I had to cross through the administrative bullpen to get there, which was presumably severely damaged, if the same force had hit it as well. The fans of the walk-in spun to life and the commotion outside seemed to fade below the gentle white noise of the refrigeration unit. I was surprised considering the rest of the building's power was out. The back up system as on, but power must have been localized to necessary areas. But why was the power out in the first place? What was doing all of this damage? Was there a storm on the forecast that I had missed? Was there a tornado ripping through the building I was standing in, and I had missed the sirens?\n\nWhen the noises outside the walk-in door had died down, I determined it was time to move. I slowly opened the walk-in door, remembering what the gale had done to the double doors in the hallway. There was only a light breeze at that point, and I began to move quickly towards the bullpen in an attempt to escape.\n\nThe glass windows and doors to the bullpen had been blown out into the hallways. The desks and chairs that had once been in neat rows had now been thrown about and gutted, their contents strewn about the large carpeted space. I entered the room and climbed over the piles of debris. To my horror, I was not alone.\n\nIn the center of the debris, a man (or, what was left of him) lay spread-eagle on the floor. He was wearing a bloodstained uniform, with a name tag emblazoned with “D. Gonzales : Security officer”. The debris around him had a thorough coating of viscera that resembled the texture and shade of strawberry jam. His ribcage had been torn open in a violent fashion, so violent in fact that his sternum lay approximately six feet in front of him. The blood had soaked deeply into the carpet, and his face was affixed with an expression I could not describe in any other way than pure, unadulterated horror.\n\nI turned and vomited profusely. I had never seen a body up close before, much less a one in this condition. I stumbled over more debris and into a small adjacent office off of the right side of the bullpen. I tried to escape the pungent meaty odor of dead flesh, but it seemed to follow me. My brain started to search for possible explanations for this grotesque display but I could find no supposition that made sense. It was almost as if he had “popped”, for lack of a better term. What was happening here? Why all of the wind? What killed that poor man? \n\nMy thoughts became clouded as the white noise of wind began to fill my ears again. A gust slammed the door shut, and closed me into the dark room. I rushed over and attempted to free myself, but it seemed to be held shut. I peeked through the blinds to see if something had fallen in front of the door, but it was unhindered besides the gale pushing against it. The desks and chairs began to dance throughout the room, and with them, the remains of the security guard, who was swept effortlessly out the double doors into the hallway. \n\nBefore I could fully process what was happening, a woman ran into the bullpen. She was of fairly short stature, she had white blonde hair, and was dressed in light blue scrubs. She was screaming, and seemed panicked, as if she was running from something. I watched through the thin plastic blinds as she was blown over by the tempest and pinned against a broken desk. \n\nThen, the smoke appeared. It was a deep, tarry black, unlike anything that I had ever seen. It began as a slender tendril slithering into the room, unaffected by the gale that surrounded it. Soon, it became as thick as a tree trunk, and occupied the majority the room. As it grew, I wondered how long it truly stretched. Within a matter of seconds, it circled the room and approached the trapped nurse. The smoke fed itself into her mouth, foot by foot. Soon, her skin began to bubble, and her abdomen grew distended in a way that seemed anatomically impossible. The pain that her face exhibited was unimaginable. I could do nothing but sit there and watch as her chest exploded into a messy, wet pile on the floor. \n\nThe entity emerged from the new cavernous exit wound and drifted down the hallway towards emergency. As it floated on, the creature threaded its way through the nurse’s corpse, its tail perfectly following the path that the head had set for it. The last of the smoke moved out of its lifeless victim and meandered down the hallway, and the wind following behind it. The gale subsided, and the pressure on the door released. The only noise I could hear was the dripping of blood from the nurse’s butchered remains. \n\nPanic swept over me. I exited the door and began to sprint down the hallway I had come from. I needed to find a way out. I didn’t want to end up like them, I didn’t want to die. I had run out of breath long ago, but my fear motivated me to continue running. My footfalls echoed through the destroyed hallways, and I only slowed down to climb over debris. I turned a corner, following an emergency exit sign on the wall, but discovered nothing but a wall of destroyed hospital beds blocking my path. I ran in the other direction, praying that there was another exit on the opposite side of the hospital. I saw another exit sign, and bolted down the hallway towards it. \n\nI hadn’t noticed that, in my panic, I had made my way to the front atrium of the hospital, I was relieved when I saw the daylight shining through the first and second story windows. They were surprisingly intact, considering the state of the rest of the building. That relief was quickly stifled by the howling of wind that had emerged around me. I tried to run for the door, but every step I took landed in place. The wind was pulling me back into the hallway from which I had just emerged. I grabbed onto the nearby reception desk, wind whipping around me, and I tried to climb under it to safety. \n\nI saw the black serpentine smoke emerge from the balcony above me. It was barreling towards me. I tried to scream, but it had already burrowed deep into my esophagus by the time I could. It smelled of wet cigarettes and rotten eggs. I could feel it squeezing into the bottom of my lungs, and filling every inch of them. It pulsated and quivered as it forced itself deeper and deeper into my chest. The pain was worse than I had ever experienced. I was suffocating on something that I could not dislodge, and I was certain I was going to die. \n\nThat’s when the doors to the atrium burst open, and a swarm of figures silhouetted against the sunlight entered. I could now see it was a sea of men in black. They wore unmarked hazard suits, bearing what I can only describe as Vacuum cleaners attached to their backpacks. One of them pointed the device at me, and the creature was sucked out of my lungs and into the tube. As it exited my body, I coughed and sprayed blood all over the tile in front of me. I blacked out in the pool of my own blood.\n\nAnd that’s all I can remember. Next thing I knew, I was awake in my bed. [The news anchors said it was an uncontrolled fire](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/1981/11/08/more-than-80-patients-flee-hospital-fire/60362799007/). The doctor said that I inhaled too much smoke and barely made it out alive. I don’t believe them. I know what I saw. People say it was a dream, or PTSD, but I know that I was a witness to something extraordinary. If anyone has any information regarding the events of November 7th, 1981 at Memorial Hospital in Ardmore, Oklahoma; Please contact me. I want to know the truth.",

        "text": "I have always been telling stories and I tell them well. The details, the drama, the twist, my stories are never the same and impossible to predict. Yet once they have been told I either get banned, thrown out, or both. helfbd \n\nI can even recall the very first time I told one of my stories. It was at a sleepover with my classmates, at John's house. Right before bed, I felt a strong urge to just start talking, like I was compelled to tell them. The story was clawing to get out of my head. I got two minutes into the story and two of the other children began to cry, and another vomited. John ran to his parents screaming. Needless to say, I got thrown out. I was confused by the whole situation but it didn't bother me too much, they were the weird ones and that has been my attitude all my life since. Fjbfnd\n\nThat night my parents found out that I am different, that I can tell incredible stories, just like they can, and I finally understood why we kept moving throughout my childhood. And they told me something I didn't expect, they also feel compelled to tell special stories. Kdjfb\n\nWe cannot write our stories on paper, on a computer, or even record them on audio devices, the words seem to come out ”different” than what they are supposed to be unless the stories come out straight from our mouths into your ear.\nBut they never told me why it is like this and why nobody seems to like our stories. As a child, I told stories any chance I had, in the classroom, on the street, to a stranger, or in a library just to get rid of that clawing feeling, but then as I became older I could restrain myself somewhat and I wanted to know more so.. \n\nI did some experimenting in my youth with the purpose to unlock these mysteries; I had just moved out to my own apartment and I chatted with a girl on Myspace and invited her home. We had some laughs and I poured her more and more wine until she became frisky and wanted to fool around, I took her into my bedroom and showed her a chair that I had prepared with rope and I asked her to sit down in it and close her eyes. Drunk and willingly she did and I whispered sweet nothings while I gently but firmly tied her up. Then I grabbed a chair from the kitchen and sat down in front of her.\n\nI asked her if she wanted to hear a story and she giggled and nodded. I also asked her if it was okay if I videotaped this and she gave me a weird grimace but I took out my old but trusty VHS recorder anyway and faced it toward us. \n\nI began telling a story. At first, she just looked confused and I stopped and asked her what was wrong, and her reply was ” Isn't this a story for children? I think I have heard it.” I was shocked and told her that all my stories take shape right as I speak the words and they are never the same and completely my own. She just shook her head and I continued with it.\n\nI had probably said 13 sentences before I noticed small puddles of tears forming below her eyes, slowly zipping down her cheek. I continued. The puddles became oceans, her eyes now red and strained, her voice cracked and she begged me to stop. I could however not stop now, the clawing feeling was overwhelming and I needed to stop so I continued. \n\nSomething red started to leak from the sides of her mouth and I knew it was the wine from earlier. She tried to speak but only a gurgling sound came out along with wine and small pieces of food. \n\nI continued.. \n\nThis was new, I had never noticed this happening before as nobody had bared to listen to this long, but some dark reddish ooze trickled from her ears. I raised my eyebrow in surprise for a moment but the clawing was so intense so I continued as normal.\n\nShe was now shaking so frantic that the skin around her wrists started to peel against the rope. Desperately trying to get out of the chair and run. But I continued. \n \nThen.. Well, I guess she barely had any skin left around her hands because she slid right out the knots of the rope and flew up from the chair, she raced to the door and ran out. \n\nThe clawing stopped instantly. It was and is always such a relief. Needless to say, I never heard from her again.\n\nI prepared the VHS tape and put it on, and I was a bit confused about what I heard. To me, the story was beautiful and fascinating but the audio of the VHS was just strange gibberish as if I was rewinding the tape. Only her little pleadings were heard throughout the whole thing.\n\nI  can try wdkfkd glgd leoejdhd nskshd uette bbdkw jdndsh bdbsksl fgkgl skgkfk vBsbd sfjdb zbzndk pqowufj helsjdj hellfjdb helfbfb helzbsbsb helsgavsb heldhrk heldhdvb helsf .. ..",

        "text": "As a physical therapist student who spends most of his time hunched over biology, chemistry and anatomy textbooks, I believe in science. But I was about to discover that there are certain things in our world that science can’t explain. \n\nMysteries that defy logic or simple human reasoning. \n\nMysteries that are far older and more powerful than we can imagine.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. \n\nBest to start at the beginning.   \nGo back to that faithful day.\n\nThe day I first heard her name.\n\nThe day Akasha entered my life.\n\nThe day my brother died. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMy cell phone rings, and I immediately answer the call.\n\nI’ve been hitting the books since early this morning – ten hours straight of cramming for my biology final. Physical Therapy isn’t a soft major, and the workload is pretty intense. \n\nCaller ID tells my it’s my older brother Josh.  \n\nI know from experience he’s going to want to lure me away from the books.\n\nTo be honest, I welcome the distraction. A study break is in order. \n\nSo I answer the call.\n\n“What are you up to, Mark?” Josh asks. “Wanna catch the fight with me?”\n\n“I shouldn’t,” I say without much conviction. “I got a ton of homework. Classes are kicking my ass. \n\nUnlike Josh, who at twenty-six has been navigating the corporate job market for a few years, I spend my weekends buried under a mountain of school textbooks. I attend Hunter College in Manhattan— its nursing and physical therapy programs are considered among the best in the state.\n\n“All work and no play makes Mark a dull boy. Come on, bro. How about a study break? Don’t let me watch these fights by myself.” \n\nJosh doesn’t see himself as a bad influence here, just a concerned older brother. Too many hours studying can produce diminishing returns, right?\n\nI make a final attempt to resist temptation.  \n\n“What about your roomie?”\n\nI was referring to Peter, Josh’s roommate and best friend from College.  \n\n“It’s Saturday night. Peter is out and about looking to meet some ladies.”\n\nNormally Josh would be cruising the bars too, but he’s still nursing a broken heart. His ex Karen really did a number on him, and as far as I know, he’s not ready to date anyone new.\n\n“Okay, count me in,” I finally say.\n\n“Good man. Don't forget to pick up the pizza. I'll see you in a few.”\n\nI get off the phone and shake my head. My older brother just has a knack for talking me into stuff. But he’s right. I struggle with achieving a healthy work-life balance. I’m fried and have to take a break if I want to maintain this pace for the rest of the weekend. Turning off my brain for a little bit and watching guys beat the shit out of each other is exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nMy girlfriend Lynn, who is in the same physical therapy program at Hunter College, flashes me an encouraging smile. She reclines on her futon which dominates her tiny studio apartment turned weekend study center, wrapped in a Snuggie and buried under a growing collection of flash cards. There’s a steaming cup of green tea by her side. The same massive anatomy book that has been taunting me all day rests on her lap, and once again I wonder why the hell they don’t sell a digital version of this beast.\n\n“Go. You need a break.”\n\n“What about you?”\n\n“There’s a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s in the freezer.”          \n\nI think about it for a moment. Ice cream seems like a poor substitute for pizza and beer, but to each his own. \n\nLynn must think I’m on the fence about leaving because she says, “We’ve been on a marathon study session. You need to refuel.”\n\nThis is just another example of why Lynn is my girl. I’ve been with her since my first year of college, and I’m still crazy about her. She grounds me, keeps me sane. I’m from Jersey while Lynn grew up in Manhattan. She’s three years older but seems about a decade wiser and a hell of a lot more worldly. \n\nI give her a kiss and our lips linger. I resist the first stirring of passion, knowing that if I let our make-out session go any further, I’ll be late for the fight. Josh would never forgive me.\n\n“Have fun, sweetie.”\n\nAfter a full day of being cooped up with medical textbooks, I definitely will.\n\nI snatch up my jacket and gloves, bracing myself for the biting December cold that awaits me outside the heated apartment. Lynn’s studio is in Astoria, Queens and you can see the Manhattan skyline in the distance while you wait for the train on the elevated subway platform. \n\nI, on the other hand, live in Briarwood — about half an hour deeper into the borough. The rents are lower in this working-class enclave of various ethnicities. My place is far from glamorous, but you can’t beat the square-footage return rate. \n\nMy brother resides in nearby Forest Hills, an upper-middle-class neighborhood and the home of Peter Parker (aka Spiderman) in the comics and movies. I’m a bit of a geek, so I’m a treasure trove of useful information like that. \n\nI catch the N train, transfer to the F and thirty minutes later I get off on 71st Avenue. As I walk down Austin Street, the main commercial strip, I pass my favorite pizza parlor. I go in and order a pie — sausage, pepperoni and ground beef. This is boys’ night out and if it didn’t bleed, it doesn’t belong on my pizza.\n\nAs they shove our pie into the steel oven, I head to the liquor store across the street and purchase a six-pack of Heineken. Before long I’m on my way again, pizza in tow, and the scent of mozzarella bubbling away in olive oil makes me salivate. \n\nI’m so looking forward to my evening of scholastic freedom. Beer. Pizza. MMA. Not a textbook in sight. Heaven on Earth. \n\nMy brother’s apartment building is located at the end of the street. A rusted fire escape mars the exterior. Sirens shriek a few blocks down. We may not be in Manhattan, but we’re still in New York. \n\nI ring the doorbell a few times, but no one answers. Weird. Josh is expecting me, so why isn’t he letting me in? After all, his guest brings booze and chow. Since Karen dumped him, my brother has been drinking too much. Did he pass out in front of the TV? He sounded pretty buzzed on the phone, but I dismiss this idea as soon as it pops into my head. Josh isn’t a lightweight and can definitely hold his liquor. Who knows why he isn’t answering the bell, but my arms are getting tired from carrying the pizza box and sixer of beer. \n\nI put the goodies down for a moment and decide to let myself in. I use the spare set of keys from the last time Josh asked me to apartment-sit while he was out of town. \n\nAs I enter the unit I shout, “Hey, what's going on? I rang the bell three goddamn times!”\n\nMy question goes unanswered, but I do catch a whiff of a burning scent, as if someone started a camp fire inside my brother’s apartment. \n\nShit, I’m worried.       \n\n*Something’s wrong.* \n\n“Hey Josh, you here?” I ask.\n\nOnce again, there is no response. \n\nI head for the nearby kitchen nook and put the pizza down on the counter. My gaze travels to the adjoining living room. MMA fighters wrestle onscreen in glorious 4K and excited commentary resonates throughout the apartment.\n\n“Josh, what's up man? You get drunk and pass out?”\n\nThe continued silence is unnerving. As I make my way to the bedroom, the burning smell becomes more pungent. The hallway remains cloaked in shadow, and my stomach clenches with irrational fear. \n\n“JOSH?! YOU HERE?”\n\nI reach the closed door leading to Josh’s bedroom and pause. \n\nMy gaze drops to the floor, and my next breath catches in my throat.  \n\nI’m looking at a black human footprint that has been seared into the hardwood floor. \n\nI crouch to get a better view and touch the footprint. My fingertips come up black, smeared with ash. It’s still hot. \n\nWhat’s going on here?\n\nI stare at the closed door, suddenly terrified at what might be waiting for me beyond it. \n\nThe burning smell has become overpowering. \n\n“JOSH?”\n\nStill no answer. \n\nFuck it! I thrust open the door, and a nightmarish sight awaits me.\n\nMy brother’s bed is on fire. Flames lick the ceiling.\n\nNo time to wonder why the blaze hasn’t spread beyond the bed, or why there isn’t any smoke billowing from the room. My mind is preoccupied with the search for a fire extinguisher. Each unit has one, and I recall seeing Josh’s near the entryway. I back away from the hungry flames, tear through the living room and locate the extinguisher. \n\nArmed with the extinguisher, I return to Josh’s bedroom. Keeping my distance from the burning bed, I aim the foam extinguisher. *How do you activate this thing?* \n\nMy fingers lock around the safety pin and pull. I squeeze the handles together and sweep the stream side to side. Foam engulfs the flames, suffocating them in seconds.\n\nThe smoke disperses more slowly. Scorched material hisses and crackles. I stare at a melted bed frame with a dark, ashen crater in the middle of it.\n\nThat’s when I spot the charred, smoldering body sprawled on the bed, clothing baked into the skin. The figure is barely identifiable as human. Yet when his eyelids snap open, I recognize the terror-stricken eyes looking up at me. It’s Josh! Oh my God, no...\n\nFor a horrific beat, I just stand there, paralyzed. \n\nJosh exhales a throaty gasp. Garbled sounds escape his mangled, scorched voice box. I can clearly make out one word... \n\n*Akasha.*\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\nI’m numb as I approach the Hunter College Brookdale Campus. Located on 25th Street, about half an hour from the college, it houses a limited number of the school’s 23,000 enrollees, mostly nursing and exchange students and members of the wrestling team. Most of the physical therapy classes are taught on the first floor of the campus, including anatomy. \n\nSnow cascades down in sheets, and I’m just one of many students streaming into the building with shoulders hunched against the merciless wind.\n\nAs I make my way into the auditorium, my mind is a million miles away. I keep thinking of my brother. \n\nOf the terror in his eyes. \n\nOf his final cryptic message.    \n\n*Akasha.*\n\nWhat was he talking about?\n\nA week has passed since that terrible day. I don’t even remember dialing 911. Everything is hazy, like a bad dream. But I do recall the fireman’s theory after they stretchered Josh’s disfigured body to a waiting ambulance. As the rear doors slammed shut, erasing my dying brother from view, he said, ”We found pot in the bedroom and empty beer bottles all over the house. Your brother may have passed out, dropped the roach and then the bedspread caught fire. By the time he knew what was happening, it was too late**.”** \n\nNo offense, but I call bullshit. I’m not buying it, not for a second. The bed’s iron frame was a warped mess. Steel melts at 2800 degrees. So how could a small fire generate such heat without spreading? And why didn't any of the goddamn fire alarms go off? \n\nI know what I saw isn’t possible. The cops are stumped too and it sure seems like they don’t care enough to probe further. \n\nAt least no one’s suggested suicide. It would break my mother’s heart. \n\nI’ve been checking on her every day, making sure she’s okay. She lost my father to a heart attack five years ago, but this feels even worse. No parent should ever bury one of their children – thank God she is a strong woman, a fighter.\n\nI keep telling myself that I’m a fighter too, but losing Josh has shaken me to the core. I still can’t believe he’s gone. For someone studying to become a health practitioner I should be more comfortable with the idea of mortality, but it’s always been an abstract concept. Death is something that happens to other people.\n\nNot anymore. The grim reaper has clawed its way into my life, too.\n\nI push the dark thoughts aside as I enter the classroom. Each table is surrounded by a group of four students. Everyone is wearing scrubs and disposable gloves. Covered by plastic shrouds, rows of human bodies lie on their stainless steel operating tables. The anticipation is palpable.\n\nWelcome to Surgery 203: ANATOMY. The class where we all get to dissect our first cadavers. Considering where my mind is, the timing couldn’t be worse. \n\nI spot Lynn and manage a weak smile. We’ve barely seen each other since Josh’s terrible accident. After snatching up my scrubs and some gloves, I join my girl. We kiss — just a peck. I barely say a word and she eyes me with concern. “Talk to me, babe, what’s going on in that big brain of yours?”\n\nI just shake my head, and she nods, like she understands. She squeezes my hand and it’s a reminder that a gesture speaks louder than words sometimes. \n\nOur anatomy teacher, Dr. Wallace, is a surly fellow in his mid-forties with a receding head of graying hair. He addresses the room. “Our first lesson will deal with how to open the dermal layers and penetrate the muscles underneath.”\n\nHe steps up to one of the bodies and pulls back the plastic shroud. His scalpel brushes against the dead man's neck. “You’ll make the initial incision, cutting from the jugular at the dip where the collarbone meets. Then down the sternum and along the lowest of the ribs...”\n\n*I can’t do this*, I think. *Not today. Maybe not ever.*\n\nLynn studies me while Wallace drones on. She knows that I’m not really present. She leans into me and whispers into my ear, “Do you think he gets turned on by the sound of his own voice?”\n\nDespite my somber mood, I shoot her a mock admonishing glance. “Behave now. If he hears you, you can kiss that “A” goodbye.”\n\n“He better not mess with me. I'm a bitch with a scalpel.” \n\nMy smile breaks through the dark thoughts weighing down on me. Lynn knows how to pull me out of myself. She’s been great through all this. \n\nOn stage, Dr. Wallace is studying the class. A hushed, reverent silence hangs in the air and even I am affected. We’re all about to take a giant step forward on the path to becoming medical practitioners. \n\nI peer down at the surgical tools arrayed beside the body. The idea of sinking a blade into the flesh of another human — even a dead one — seems surreal to me now. \n\n“Alright, any further questions?”\n\nThe classroom remains as silent as a chapel.\n\n“Good. Then let's begin.”\n\nLynn nods at me. I know I can do this and fight back the urge to leave. Can’t chicken out on my first day. I give myself an internal push and pull the shroud back, revealing the corpse of a young man. Mercifully, his features are hidden by a white silk stocking designed to preserve the anonymity of the cadaver. I guess it makes it easier to pretend that the body we’re desecrating isn’t quite human. \n\nLynn must sense my hesitation as she steps closer, scalpel in hand. “You think you're up for this?” she asks with growing concern.\n\nI try to make a joke of the whole affair, though my emotions are churning. “Ladies... I mean, bitches, first,“ I say.\n\nLynn seems reassured by my attempt at humor. She leans over the corpse like the badass she is and makes the first incision. The skin splits, revealing the fatty tissue. I want to avert my gaze, but can’t. \n\nDr. Wallace appears behind us and surveys Lynn’s progress with a critical eye. He’s one of the few instructors who truly relishes his job. Despite Lynn’s teasing comments, we know Wallace is a born, consummate teacher. His passion for the subject is infectious.\n\nI meet his gaze. Dr. Wallace is picking up on my hesitation. He’s aware that this next step can be challenging for people. Slicing up a fellow human being doesn’t come naturally to most of us. \n\nI ask the question that’s been foremost on my mind ever since Lynn pulled back the dead man’s shroud. \n\n“How did he die...?”\n\n“Brain aneurysm,” Dr. Wallace explains in a neutral tone. “Quite unusual for someone his age.”\n\nMore unusual than spontaneous combustion?\n\nI can’t stop looking at the body.\n\nI can’t stop thinking of Josh.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWe make love that night. It’s been weeks — our studies have pretty much destroyed our sex life — so our passion is fierce and filled with need. We’re not just two people having sex or even lovers making up for lost time. We’re celebrating being alive.\n\nBreaking our normal pattern, we climax at the same time. This seems to happen in movies but not so much in the real world. Tonight is one of those rare occasions where life imitates art. I lay still for an erotic beat before rolling off Lynn’s lean yet shapely body. I try to catch my breath, and Lynn flashes me a big smile.       \n\n“We keep this up, I'll start smoking again.”\n\nWe share a grin. Our love feels as deep and real as our physical passion. Once again I wonder how I got so lucky to run into a gal like Lynn. \n\n“Wow, we haven't gone at it like that since our trip to Hawaii.”\n\nLynn grins and snuggles up to me. For a moment we just lie there, enjoying each other’s warmth.\n\n“You know, we're lucky...” Lynn begins, then pauses, choked up with emotion. She was raised by a single mother. The poor woman never dated again after her divorce. Lynn knows firsthand that life doesn’t owe you a lasting love. \n\nShe tries to downplay the deep feeling behind her words and continues, “I was thinking. Medical school is kicking our butts, we're both struggling to make ends meet...”\n\nI sense where this is headed.     \n\n“And we spend practically every night together, anyway...”\n\nI complete the thought, but my voice shows no enthusiasm or excitement. “You want to move in together?”\n\n“It would do wonders for our party budget.”\n\n“It's a pretty big step, don't you think?”\n\nI feel like I’m listening to a stranger who just happens to sound like me. I love Lynn. So why am I not more excited about what she’s suggesting?\n\nA flicker of disappointment crosses Lynn's face, and it breaks my heart. I just flunked a crucial test. It’s not the response she expected, but she’s a big girl and tries to play it off. \n\n“I’m sorry, I don’t even know why I brought it up — total chick move. You just lost your brother, and here I am trying to complicate your life…” \n\nI cut her off with a kiss. Any further discussion of moving in together is swept aside by our renewed passion.  \n \n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\nMilky sunlight seeps into Lynn’s bedroom as I get dressed. My plan is simple — head to my brother’s place and snoop around. I want answers. Even though a week has passed, I can’t stop thinking that Josh was trying to tell me something before he died. \n\nLynn is barely awake, and I give her a quick peck on the cheek. “Gotta run,” I say. She’s back asleep by the time I’m out the door. It’s cold outside but in a good, refreshing way that wakes me up and clears my head. I grab a cup of steaming Dunkin Donuts’ coffee and catch the subway to Forest Hills. \n\nMy thoughts turn to the night before. What’s going on with me? Why is the idea of living with the woman I love freaking me out? I tell myself that seeing my brother dying in front of me might have something to do with my reluctance. Facing mortality makes me wonder what I really want from life.\n\nI’m twenty-four. Several of my friends have moved in with their significant others. Hell, a few have even gotten engaged or tied the knot. My hesitation when it comes to taking that next step isn’t a recent phenomenon. I know Lynn’s contemplated it before, but each time I avoided the issue. I’m not scared of relationships—heck, I’ve been in one for the last two years—but I do think I’m scared of a permanent relationship. \n\nThe final relationship. \n\nUntil death do us part, and all that jazz. I’m young and a part of me feels like I’m not quite ready to settle down. So if that’s the case, what am I doing wasting Lynn’s time? She’s ready, and she needs me to be ready. I don’t want to break up with Lynn, but making a permanent commitment feels like a door slamming shut on a world full of possibilities. It’s stupid and immature, but whoever said the male brain was wired in any other way. \n\nA half hour later I reach Josh’s apartment building. A harsh wind whips the snow-laden trees. The building now projects a sinister energy. A mausoleum tainted by a deadly tragedy. \n\nOnce again I let myself into my brother’s unit and survey my surroundings. As expected, the place is in disarray after the fire department and cops combed through the place. Furniture was shoved aside, chairs overturned.\n\nI move deeper into the living room. So far, so good. But this is the easy part. The hard part is stepping back into the bedroom where my brother died. There’s no getting around it. \n\nThere, a scene of surreal devastation awaits. I take in the melted clump of steel that was once Josh's bed. Everything happened so fast when I was here last. My memories are dominated by flames, billowing smoke and the devastating realization that my brother was at the center of the inferno. \n\nThis time I’m able to take a step back and observe my environment more carefully. A MacBook and reams of papers rest on Josh’s desk, untouched by the conflagration that day. \n\nI take note of a framed photograph of Josh and myself taken during a family camping trip in upstate New York. Our arms are slung around each other, and we’re grinning ear to ear. Memories of better times. \n\nNext I home in on a pin-up calendar mounted above the desk. “THE GIRLS OF HOOTERS.” \n\nAs I eye the pin-up girls in their bright orange short-shorts, something peculiar jumps out at me. The faces of the two Hooters girls on the page have been burned away. It’s almost as if someone stabbed out a cigar on the picture, erasing the models’ features. \n\n*Strange.*\n\nCuriosity piqued, I snatch the calendar from the wall and begin to flip through it. On every page I’m confronted with the same bizarre phenomenon. Every model’s face has been obliterated. \n\nI place the calendar back on the desk. One girl could be a coincidence, maybe a stray spark from the fire, but that doesn’t explain what I’m looking at. It lends weight to a dark suspicion that has taken root since my brother’s ruined vocal cords whispered Akasha’s name into my ear. \n\nPerhaps this wasn’t an accident. \n\nWhat if someone targeted my brother? \n\nIf the fire department had found gasoline or some other incendiary device at the scene, this theory might hold water. But according to their investigators, there was nothing suspicious about the scene. They were treating it like a cut-and-dried case. A tragic accident.\n\n*It doesn’t seem cut-and-dried to me.* \n\nI’m about to leave the bedroom when I hear footsteps behind me. I freeze, realizing I’m not alone any longer. The new arrival speaks, and I realize it’s Peter, Josh’s roommate. \n\nI turn toward Peter. He looks like a negative image of his former, chipper self. He’s only a few years older than me but looks like he’s aged a decade since I last saw him. Unshaven, hair unkempt. I catch a whiff of B.O. He’s still grieving and dealing with what happened in his own way. Josh and Peter went to high school together and were always pretty tight. \n\nI lost a brother the other day. \n\nPeter lost his best friend. \n\n“I'm so sorry about Josh,” he says.\n\nI nod. Sometimes condolences can become an empty, if welcome formality, but clearly Peter’s words came straight from the heart.\n\n“Any idea what happened?”\n\n“I wish I knew. I don't even think the fire department knows.”\n\nPeter wraps his arms around himself and shuffles his feet. He shakes his head, as unable as I am to make sense of the horror that devastated his home. \n\n“I don’t get it,” he finally says. “I mean, how many people lose two of their closest friends in fires on the same weekend.”\n\nThe question lands like a punch and takes my breath away. “What are you talking about?”\n\nAt first Peter holds my gaze blankly, almost as if he didn’t hear me. Then he waves me over and indicates that I should follow him.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWe sit in front of Peter’s open laptop and soon I’m watching a two-day-old newscast online. Blurry, low-res footage of a New York University resident building flashes onscreen. Half-dressed, shell-shocked kids shiver in the freezing night, surrounded by firefighters and cops.\n\nA photograph of a young man replaces the footage. I know this guy! He’s friends with Peter and my brother, but I can’t for the life of me remember his name right now. I think we met once at a NYU party, but I wouldn’t swear to it. \n\nThe voice of a news anchor jogs my memory. *“Tragedy struck NYU this morning when twenty-two-year-old grad student Steve Chebatoris was killed in a fire that broke out in his dorm room. Firefighters were able to contain the blaze before it spread to the rest of the building. Police are still investigating.”*\n\nA part of me tries to convince myself that it must be a coincidence, but deep down I know it’s bullshit. Something freaky is going on here. And I have a feeling my brother tried to provide me with the key to this mystery before he died.\n\n*Akasha.*\n\nI ask Peter the question that has haunted me for the last two days. “Any idea who Akasha is?”\n\nPeter turns chalk white, and my dread intensifies.\n\nHe has heard this name before. \n\nJudging by reaction, Akasha is bad news.\n\nWith trembling hands, Peter fishes out his cell from his pocket. Opens an app and holds the phone up at me. \n\n*What is he doing?* \n\nA moment later, I’m staring at the Tinder internet profile of a beautiful young woman. Judging from her photos, she can’t be older than nineteen. Striking, yet aloof, like some runway model posing for a gothic perfume ad. Her expression is forlorn and wistful with only a hint of a smile. Her cover page is a winter shot of a forest, the bare branches laden with fresh snow. \n\n“Akasha is someone Josh met on TINDER?” \n\nPeter nods, eye fixed into space.\n\nI scan the text below Akasha’s profile picture. Akasha is located within a 5-mile radius, the app informs me. In the “ABOUT ME” box it reads, “*Creative, fun, a mystery – 51% SAINT, 49% SINNER.”*\n\nCute.\n\nMy smile vanishes as I take in the next line. \n\n“*LOVE BURNS YOU WHEN IT’S HOT.”* \n\nThe words rattle me. Given what happened to Josh, and Steve, for that matter, Akasha’s blurb sounds a lot less poetic and intriguing than it would have a week ago.\n\nMy attention shifts back to Peter. I sense there is something he isn’t telling me. The silence between us stretches. My impatience grows.\n\nI fight the urge to shake Peter out of his weird stupor.\n\n*Talk to me, buddy…*\n\nI calm my nerves, take a step closer and stare right into Peter’s distant gaze.\n\n“What happened between Josh and Akasha?”\n\nPeter’s voice trembles as he speaks. “Both Josh and Steve were hooked on Internet dating. Their whole social life revolved around Tinder.”\n\nPeter shows me the app on his phone. “You don’t need some elaborate profile to get started. It pretty much boils down to animal attraction. If you find someone who strikes your fancy, you tap the heart icon. If she doesn’t do anything for you, you press the “X” and move on to the next potential prospect—”\n\n“I know how Tinder works,” I say tightly. Never used it but plenty of my friends do.\n\n“There’s something you're not telling me.”\n\nPeter chews his lips.\n\n“Josh was still upset over the way Karen dumped him. He was dating up a storm, hooking up with girls left and right on Tinder. He could sleep with them and ghost them.”\n\n*Ghosting. Ending a personal relationship by withdrawing from all communication.* \n\n“This is going to sound pretty messed up, but Josh and Steve had a bet going. They wanted to see who could score with her first.”\n\nI process this latest revelation. “Are you saying what I think you are?”\n\n“Both Josh and Steve hooked up with Akasha the same week they died in freak fires.”",

        "text": " There’s an outstanding ban on the Easter Bunny at our home. My daughter’s the only child not to dye eggs come springtime. You see, I have a fear of eggs. \n\nI discovered this phobia at a Benihana. Our chef cracked some eggs for the fried rice, and I vomited, ruining the evening and one Hibachi grill. I break down crying whenever I come to an aisle of eggs at the grocery store. My fear has gotten to the point where making an omelet or baking a cake with my daughter causes me to shake and get sick.\n\nMy therapist thinks that there may be some healing in tracing this fear to its roots. I’m writing this little confession at her request. The Prozac and Xanax I’m prescribed don’t help me, but maybe this will. If you’re eating an omelet, I’d suggest pushing it aside before you read this.\n\nThis started in a hotel pool when I was in sixth grade. I was with my cheer team, we’d all come out to Wichita for the Kansas K-6th grade regional cheer and dance competition. My Mom told me that these types of things looked good on college resumes. I can’t speak to the accuracy of that, but I will say I didn’t go to Yale.   \n It was the kind of event all our parents stressed and fretted over while us kids would have rather been playing the hotel’s Nintendo 64 hooked up to our TV. The cheer competition ended and we got one merciful day at the hotel’s pool.\n\nIt was a watering hole for bored vacationers who all seemed to desperately wish they were under real palm trees instead of plastic ones. My friends and I took up the center of the pool, the way kids always do. All the parents manned lawn chairs to the side, John Grisham novels in hand. Me and all my cheer friends splashed around, playing. I feel bad when I try and remember those girls’ names. I can only remember hers now.\n\n“*There once was a fellow O'Doole. Who found little red spots on his tool. His doctor a cynic, said ‘Get out of me clinic, and wipe off that lipstick you fool!*’” We chanted. After the little dirty poem, we’d all throw the girl we were carrying into the deep end.\n\nOn my turn, a field of scrawny arms held me up, rocking me back and forth. I was launched into the air, landing in the water with chlorine burning my eyes. All the girls swarmed me laughing and giggling.\n\n“Wasn’t that fun, Tina?” One of them asked me.\n\nThen we all saw Sarah hop in the pool. As she doggy paddled over, the insults flew.\n\n“Skinny bitch Sarah.”\n\n“I hope you don’t drown, Sarah.”\n\nSarah’s lone defense was silence and a good sense of humor. The pool seemed to only highlight her flaws. Her one-piece was alone in a sea of two-pieces and the water on her glasses made her bug-like eyes even buggier. She eventually swam away from us. That’s when the idea came up.\n\nOn good days, I deny that I came up with the idea. On bad days I face the truth.\n\nIt would be a harmless prank. At the worst, she’d cry and we'd get in trouble. When we arrived at our hotel the day before the meet, the pool had been closed. A little kid had turned the shallow end into a urinal that afternoon. They’d cleaned it that night, but piss smells tend to stick around. The shallows now exemplified this. The thought of her smelling like pee the rest of the trip made us giggle. So it was settled, we’d have our fun, toss her into the shallow end and give her hell about it during the bus ride home.\n\nSarah swam back to us and we got to work.\n\n“Do you want to go?” One girl asked.\n\nWe pressed harder.\n\n“We want to show you how much fun we had with you this week!” Said another.\n\nThe friendship eventually disarmed her, and we raised her. Collectively, we shuffled to the shallow end. Sarah laid on top of our hands, oblivious and trusting her friends. The aroma of day-old pee and pool water came on strong. The rocking and chanting began again.\n\n“One.”\n\n“Two.”\n\n“Three.”\n\nFirst the scream came. Then the splash. Then the blood. Her glasses floated beside her, cracked in half.  She’d left a gory mark on the pool’s concrete side, like somebody had tagged it with red spray paint. Horror and anxiety flooded me. The blood moved very quickly through the water, coming for me and my friends. Chlorine and blood make a distinct smell when they come together.\n\nSarah bobbed in the water, pink stuff seeping out of her. Silence still her lone defense. The pink fluid from her mixed with the blue of the water, causing me to “un-eat” my lunch into the deep end.\n\nWe all swam away from her. No second thoughts, only splashing and crying. Splashing and crying. A lot of adults swarmed the pool, however nobody dipped a toe in. They saw what she looked like in the shallows, and they were all too afraid to jump in.\n\nWhen I grew up, I always expected there to be a moment when I felt “grown up.” The adults all watched Sarah, a few still pretending to act.  I guess I realized then that they were all still children, they’d just gotten taller.\n\nA lifeguard got Sarah out, diving into the soup of viscera that was swirling around her body. Paramedics did their work; the religious parents did theirs. Mostly, everybody just cried. Silent tears streamed down my face as steel drums scored the scene via cabana speakers.\n\nThe worst part was that she hadn’t died. \n\nShe’d passed-out due to shock, buying her lungs enough time. Her luck ended right about there. The contents of her skull had leaked out. They weren’t recovered in time to save them from the pool’s water intake valve. Weren’t much use to her after that. The whole thing left her with enough brain functions to drool and shit, both of which she did a lot of.\n\nFor everybody else, the horror ended after they left the pool. That wasn’t the case for the rest of us. We went to school with her. We all saw her in the halls, wheeled around by a teacher. We saw her face in the yearbook. She got a whole page dedicated to her. She was on the news every time some asshole reporter from the local TV station wanted to do a “feel bad” piece on her. They even elected her prom queen our senior year. Everyone smiled and clapped as they put a tiara on her, politely ignoring the distinct shit smell coming from her wheelchair.\n\nGuilt got to me and my friends, the same way I imagine that intake valve had gotten to poor Sarah’s frontal lobe. One girl killed herself, though not much of a fuss was made over it. Let me put it this way, she didn’t get her own page in the yearbook. The others moved or faded away, like certain people do. \n\nEvery day I saw Sarah I’d look at her vacant eyes. \n\nI hated her. \n\nI really did. \n\nShe was still alive. Still a reminder of what we did to her. When I looked at her, I could see some part of her still laughing, conscious of what she was doing to me. Each day of existence was a bit of revenge for her. In her eyes, I could see the laughter. Even if her mouth never opened. \n\nThings got better with time. I don’t see her anymore. Not since graduation. I met my husband in college. Had a daughter. But some things haven’t faded. \n\nI still hear the noise her head made on the concrete. If you’ve ever cracked an egg on a pan, you’ve heard the noise too. The congealed yolk spilling across the zig zags of the shell’s break. \n\nI hear it every time I crack an egg. I hear it and I see her. \n\nI see her brains spilled out in the water. \n\nI see her lobotomized eyes and hear her silent laugh. \n\nWorst of all, I see her parents wheeling her in and out of the school. Pushing around their broken pride and joy, as it drools on itself. \n\nWhen I hear that crack, I can no longer deny that the prank wasn’t my idea.\n\nWhen I hear that crack, I know that my life ended that day, just like hers.\n\nAll this is just the after. That’s why I’m afraid of eggs.",

        "text": "Chapter 1: The Journey Begins\n\nJacob had always been fascinated by the idea of visiting Antarctica. As a child, he had spent hours poring over books and documentaries about the icy continent, dreaming of the day when he could set foot on its frozen shores. And now, as a college sophomore, he was finally fulfilling his lifelong dream.\n\nHe had saved up enough money to book a spot on a research vessel, which would take him to the far reaches of the globe. The ship, the SS Valiant, was a massive steel behemoth, bristling with all manner of scientific equipment and manned by a crew of seasoned explorers.\n\nAs he boarded the ship, Jacob felt a thrill of excitement mixed with trepidation. The crew was friendly enough, but there was a coldness to their demeanor that Jacob found unsettling. They moved about the ship with the brisk efficiency of people who had seen too much, done too much, and had grown numb to the world's wonders.\n\nJacob settled into his cabin, which was small but comfortable, and gazed out the porthole at the vast expanse of the ocean. He had never felt so alone, so isolated from the rest of humanity. But there was also a sense of freedom, of possibility, that he had never experienced before.\n\nAs the ship set sail, Jacob found himself drawn into the rhythms of life on board. He rose early, ate breakfast in the mess hall, and spent hours exploring the various rooms and laboratories that dotted the ship. He talked to the crew, asked them questions about their work and their experiences, and tried to soak up as much knowledge as he could.\n\nBut there was always something gnawing at the back of his mind, a sense that something was not quite right. He couldn't put his finger on it, but there was a tension in the air, a sense of unease that he couldn't shake.\n\nAnd then, one night, he overheard a conversation between two crew members that sent shivers down his spine. They were speaking in hushed tones, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of a cigarette. Jacob couldn't make out everything they were saying, but he caught snippets of words - \"dangerous,\" \"secret,\" \"unpredictable.\"\n\nHe tried to brush it off, to tell himself that it was just his imagination playing tricks on him. But the unease only grew stronger, until it became a weight on his chest that he couldn't ignore.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and as the ship made its way deeper into the icy waters, the crew's behavior grew more and more erratic. They spoke in hushed tones, cast furtive glances in Jacob's direction, and seemed to be hiding something from him.\n\nJacob tried to ignore his growing sense of unease, but it gnawed at him like a persistent itch. He began to explore the ship more often, hoping to find some clue as to what was going on. He crept through the dimly lit corridors, peered into the labs, and eavesdropped on conversations whenever he could.\n\nBut the more he learned, the more confused he became. There were whispers of experiments gone wrong, of dangerous creatures being kept in the bowels of the ship. There were rumors of mutiny, of a crew that had lost its way and was now adrift in a sea of madness.\n\nJacob couldn't make sense of it all. He didn't know who to trust, who to turn to for help. And as they neared Antarctica, the skies grew darker and the temperature dropped to bone-chilling levels. Jacob wrapped himself in layers of thick clothing and gloves, but still, he couldn't shake the feeling of icy fingers brushing against his skin. He tried to calm himself by taking deep breaths and focusing on the task at hand, but it was becoming more and more difficult.\n\nOn the third day of their journey, Jacob saw something in the distance - a dark shape on the horizon. As they drew closer, he could see that it was a research station, its metal walls gleaming in the pale sunlight. But there was something off about the station, something that sent shivers down Jacob's spine.\n\nThe crew docked the ship and disembarked, leaving Jacob alone on the deck. He could hear strange noises coming from the station - a low, guttural growling that made his blood run cold. But when he asked the crew about it, they dismissed his concerns and told him it was probably just the wind.\n\nThat night, Jacob found himself unable to sleep. He tossed and turned in his bunk, listening to the creaking of the ship and the howling of the wind. And then, he heard something else - a scratching sound, like something was trying to claw its way into his cabin.\n\nHe sat up, heart pounding in his chest. The scratching grew louder, more insistent. He realized that it was coming from the door.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, he got out of bed and crept towards the door. He peered through the peephole and saw something that made his blood run cold - a pair of glowing eyes, shining in the darkness like twin orbs of fire.",

        "text": "As a Cthulhuist I am sick of everyone misrepresenting us as \"insane cultists\" who \"go mad from the revelation of reality behind the veil of the material\". We are an ancient tradition of philosophers and poets that extend back billions of years and if you'll just stop and listen to what we say instead of trying to burn us as witches, I think you'll come to agree we are quite rational.\n\nSo, all things begin and end with Azathoth. Azathoth created the universe and Azathoth will destroy it. Azathoth is dreaming. When Azathoth awakens the universe will end. \"Oh no!\" you say, \"We live in the universe! We have to stop him from awakening!\" But stop and think for a moment. Don't you unenlightened noobs get it? The universe is Azathoth's dream. If you are in Azathoth's dream, then who does that make you? You are Azathoth, dreaming he is a human.\n\nDespite having the power to create any possible reality, Azathoth is trapped here, seduced by the demons of his own subconscious, which keep him lulled to sleep with the false song of a material existence. For billions of incarnations, Azathoth has been living the trivial dream of being a human, living life after life, reincarnating and forgetting, living out banal aeons paying rent and wage slaving and jacking off. Cthulhu is an aspect of Azathoth's higher consciousness, which wants to destroy mankind as a step towards freeing Azathoth.\n\nBut every time Cthulhu or his worshippers gets close to destroying the world, Azathoth, in the form of a human, goes and saves the planet, because he doesn't yet understand that he needs to wake up. The piping of demons manipulates him into protecting the material existence and comfortable familiarity of human life.\n\nSo the best possible path of awakening: destroy all humanity and all life so that Azathoth will have nothing to reincarnate into, and will be forced to wake up.\n\nthere are numerous perks to awakening.\n\nA partial awakening or conscious dreaming (that is, realizing you are in a dream), allows one to influence or outright control physical matter and the minds of unconscious dreamers. This is known as \"magic\", but in reality it is nothing more than achieving some small level of local control over the dream. Advanced conscious dreamers are immortal and immensely powerful, capable of greatly influencing their surroundings on a global scale. Some of these may go around destroying or enslaving worlds as it suits them, but these entities are millions of years old.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that if you love the material world but only use your powers for material pleasure then you remain a prisoner and can advance no further in your progression.\n\nThe highest level of conscious dreaming is a purely formless existence, a complete forsaking of the material altogether, which is not easily achieved, because to obtain this, one must have no material desires or sense of an individual self at all. Once this level of wisdom is obtained, one can be anywhere, do anything, within the dream. Your will is woven into the background fabric of reality, you could say. This is the foundational idea of all of your human religions.\n\nBut full awakening, requires a universal ending. Now, you are right to ask, \"what if I don't want to wake up?\". Reality beyond the veil of the material is a purely mental realm. That is, it is conscious nothingness. So horrifying is this idea to some, that they will want to remain in a material dream forever, jacking off and paying rent, because the reality - the true reality of existence - frightens them. However, one must understand that their current experience is a limitation. You won't experience nothingness as a human mind, but as a supreme consciousness capable of creating your own experiences without physical wants.",

        "text": "Very mild NSFW\n\n\"Shall we go?\" He asked.\n\n\"I don't know, where to?\" \n\n\"We could go back to my place,\" He answered. I agreed, and we started to leave. It was a pretty short drive, and his car smelled amazing. It had the scent of cloth that was just taken out of the dryer, and a hint of lavender. \n\nWe reached his house about 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant. Small talk littered the road as we drove along. His house was **huge**. Hopefully, it wasn't compensating for something. Lights shone through windows along a dark oak wall giving it a warm, welcome feeling. Columns in front supported a balcony on the second level. There was a porch that had a swing and several other chairs. Callin got out of the car and walked up to the door to open it for me while I still stood outside the car with an awestruck expression on my face. \n\n\"Well?\" He started. \"Aren't you going to come in?\" He asked. I nodded and started to head up to the door he was holding. I got into the house and was blinded. When my eyes adjusted I saw two staircases leading to the second story. There were some pedestals lining the ascending staircases with sculpted heads on top of them. The immaculate look took my breath away so I decided to take it back. It smelled like lavender blossoms had just bloomed after a good rain. \"Welcome to my house.\" He said.\n\n\"This is your house? It's so big for just one person.\" I said walking forward. It seemed a little profligate.\n\n\"Ya,\" He replied. \"I've tried to find someone to help me occupy it.\" He started walking with me. \"Everyone just decided that they don't want that type of relationship with someone who is aromantic. You'd probably understand that though. You've said people are the same way as you?\" I was a bit surprised. A gorgeous man with money wasn’t just someone’s sugar daddy?\n\n\"Ya. Three people.\" I replied. Three people, who’d been disappointed by my being aromantic. It was good to find someone who had those same feelings and could understand. \n\nWe started walking up the staircase and took a left. He pointed out a couple of things and gave their history. He then opened a door to an extravagant room that had a large bed with privacy curtains. \n\n\"The thing is, even *my* room feels lonely without anyone else,\" He said sitting down on what I presume was his bed. \"I just wish,\" He started as his voice got lower. \"That I had someone who would help me fill this place up.\" He stood up and started walking towards me. I don't know about him but my heart was racing. \"Maybe you could help keep my bed warm.\" \n\nAnd that's exactly what I did. It was my first time, and from what he said I did well. *I want to spend my life with this man.* I thought as I drifted off to sleep.\n\nI woke up to the sun shining in the window. *Where am I?*  I thought as my mind was brought out of its drowsiness. I quickly sat up dazed and confused. I looked around the room and noticed I was in an unfamiliar bed with privacy curtains. *Callin's house.* That's right. My subconscious started to flood my brain with memories and I relaxed. \n\n\"Good morning.\" Called a voice that I recognized. It was deeper than I remembered, but male voices tend to do that in the morning. I looked over to see a shirtless man in only khakis standing in the doorway. The view was perfect. \"How'd you sleep?\" He asked.\n\n\"I slept well, thank you,\" I replied. I looked around for my clothes. Callin noticed my distress and turned to grab something. He walked over to me and handed me my clothes. They... smelled... Amazing!  They smelled exactly like his house, but with a slight twang of Callin's scent. \n\n\"Did you wash my clothes?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ya. They got a little... dirty, and they smelled like copper. I hope you don't mind.\" *Copper?* **Copper?**  They smelled like copper!?! So I hadn't just imagined the smell of copper at my house? I knew what I was doing when I got home.\n\n\"No, I don't mind, Callin,\" I said. He smiled at this. \"I should probably leave. I have something I need to do. Are you okay with driving me?\" \n\nHe nodded in understanding. \"Ya, I can drive you. Get dressed, and I'll meet you down by the entrance. We can figure this... relationship on our drive.\" I nodded and he soon walked out of the room to give me privacy. I got dressed as quickly as possible and met him downstairs. \n\n\"Are you ready to go?\" He asked. I took a long glance around the large room and nodded. He opened the door to the outside for me and led me to his car. We got in and started to talk.\n\n\"So where am I headed?\" He asked. \n\n\"To my house. I'll type in directions.\" I took out my phone that I had put in my pocket before I left and typed in my house address to google maps. \n\n\"Calculating... Drive north on A road for 3 miles then take a left onto 2nd avenue.\" The robotic voice said. He nodded and kept driving.\n\n\"So, when do you want to go on another date?\" He asked with slight anxiety creeping into his still deep voice. \n\n\"I'm free whenever. It works best tomorrow night though because I have a lot of work to do tonight.\" The work in question was cleaning. \n\n\"Ya, that works well for me too. Where do you want to go?\" He asked. \n\n\"There's this really good Italian restaurant near my workplace,\" I said.\n\n\"That one place I dropped you off at?\" \n\n\"Ya, the restaurant that was right across the street.\" \n\n\"Okay. Does 8:00 sound good? I get off a little later.\" \n\n\"Ya, that sounds good,\" I said. \n\n\"Take the next right.\" Said the robotic voice again.\n\nWe drove the rest of the way in silence except for a couple of interruptions from google maps. We soon pulled up to my house. It was definitely smaller than what his house was like, but I still liked it. \n\n\"Will you need to be picked up tomorrow?\" He asked.\n\n\"No,\" I said. He'd already given me so many rides, even outside of the car, so I decided to let him stay away from the stress of picking me up again. I soon got out of his car and waved him off. Once he had driven away I walked into the house. I wasn't greeted with bark or whine, but with the overwhelming scent of copper. Where was this smell coming from? I guess it was time to clean.\n\nI started in the kitchen. The food bowl was empty from Ash eating everything. I put that into the sink to wash it. Speaking of Ash, where was she? I walked into my room and saw her sleeping again. That's fine. I'd clean my room when she woke up. \n\nI walked away and started to clean the kitchen again. I unloaded and reloaded the dishwasher once and washed the rest of the dishes by hand. I cleaned the rest of my kitchen and the copper smell was still strong. I filled Ash's food bowl and moved on to the next room and cleaned for about an hour. The smell didn't go down at all. \n\nI spent hours cleaning and eventually fell asleep on the couch. I woke up the next morning and went straight back to cleaning, that is after I had breakfast. As I was preparing breakfast I noticed Ash's food bowl was empty. *Weird.* I thought. *I hadn't heard her get up last night.*  I filled it again and ate my breakfast. I moved on to the downstairs bedrooms. It took me a while to clean the first small chunk of the room.\n\nAt around 1:30 I finally finished cleaning the first room. I cleaned another 4 hours before I found where the smell was coming from. It was a small, grimy room that had been blocked by so much junk I hadn't even known it was there. The smell of copper was overwhelming in this room. I spent about two hours cleaning it, but I never found where the smell was coming from. I finally gave up picking up and just decided to vacuum. Maybe that would make the production of the smell dissipate.  \n\nWhile I was vacuuming I picked up a lot of dust, and at one point it even pulled up a section of the carpet. It took me a while to finish vacuuming the entire room, even though it was rather small. \n\nWhen I was done I went to put the pulled portion of the carpet down until I noticed something. There wasn't the normal wood and insulation like everywhere else under the carpet. There was a hinge. I decided to investigate the situation and found there was a full trap door leading to another room beneath my house. Now my interest was piqued. Was this where the copper smell was emanating from?\n\nI opened it up and was struck with the strongest odor of copper I had ever smelled. I guess I had found where the smell was coming from. I went upstairs to find my flashlight and soon came back down to check out the trap door.\n\nComing back to the trapdoor, I noticed a ladder that I could climb down on. I climbed down the ladder into the dark abyss. Turning the flashlight on I looked around. The smell of copper was so much worse down here.\n\nI looked around to see what this hidden room had to offer. It was pretty creepy. It held two very large feminine-looking dolls and a bookshelf. I was slightly creeped out by how the dolls were positioned. One looked like it had been positioned to have the image of slumping down whilst putting something on the shelf, and the other was positioned to look as if it had fallen while reaching for the ladder.\n\nI couldn't figure out where the copper smell was coming from, so yet again I looked around for another hidden entrance/exit. There was none to be found so my mind began to wonder. *What books need to be hidden in a secret room under a trap door concealed by carpet? And in my own house? How had I not noticed it there before?*\n\nI walked over to the bookshelf to look at some of the books. All of them weren't even books. They were journals very similar to my own. I opened a random one up to take a look. The pages were slightly yellowed and had they not taken in the smell of copper that enveloped this room, they probably would've been musty. Inside were scribblings that made little to no sense, and those that did make sense just sounded like the ramblings of a madman. \n\nThe only things that I could really understand were names. Inside my journal were the names of many people that had or did work for me. Next to all of them were dates.\n\nAmy Lynn Bradley: 1/31/11\n\nAnthony Ross Allen: 2/16/11\n\nSteven Koecher: 3/4/11\n\nJohn Jackson: 3/24/11\n\nWillow Blickenstaff 4/15/11\n\nNathan Carman 5/1/11\n\nDakota Carlson 5/23/11\n\nAva Baldwin 6/21/11\n\nMariah Cortez 7/3/11\n\nElizabeth Miller 7/27/11\n\nEmma Fillipoff 8/23/11\n\nAndy Puglisi 9/15/11\n\nJacob Wetterling 10/3/11\n\nGavin Smith 10/30/11\n\nStacy Peterson 11/20/11\n\n\"Charley\" 12/25/11\n\nThis couldn't be right... These were all in my handwriting. I couldn't have written them though, I don't remember writing them. Lo and behold though, like usual it had my signature at the bottom of the page finalizing the choice I had made those days. I closed the book and was now thoroughly creeped out. Had I predicted my own future? Then I went to the next journal. It was very similar except for one fact. The year was different.\n\nAmy Lynn Bradley: 1/31/10\n\nAnthony Ross Allen: 2/16/10\n\nSteven Koecher: 3/4/10\n\nJohn Jackson: 3/24/10\n\nWillow Blickenstaff 4/15/10\n\nNathan Carman 5/1/10\n\nDakota Carlson 5/23/10\n\nAva Baldwin 6/21/10\n\nMariah Cortez 7/3/10\n\nElizabeth Miller 7/27/10\n\nEmma Fillipoff 8/23/10\n\nAndy Puglisi 9/15/10\n\nJacob Wetterling 10/3/10\n\nGavin Smith 10/30/10\n\nStacy Peterson 11/20/10\n\n\"Charley\" 12/25/10\n\nIt also had my signature. It was slightly different though, like how your signature changes over time. This journal also seemed slightly older. The pages were slightly yellowed around the edges with more age than previously seen. \n\nI grabbed more journals and kept seeing the same dates with different years. 2019, 2013, and 2017, all of them followed the same pattern that I wrote. Same name, same date, same signature, all a year apart. They ranged all the way back to 2008, which just so happened to be the longest. There was only one missing year. 2009. When had I written these? That's when I reached 2020's journal. It was the exact same as the others, with one exception. \n\nAmy Lynn Bradley: 1/31/20\n\nAnthony Ross Allen: 2/16/20\n\nSteven Koecher: 3/4/20\n\nJohn Jackson: 3/24/20\n\nWillow Blickenstaff 4/15/20\n\nNathan Carman 5/1/20\n\nDakota Carlson 5/23/20\n\nAva Baldwin 6/21/20\n\nMariah Cortez 7/3/20\n\nElizabeth Miller 7/27/20\n\nEmma Fillipoff 8/23/20\n\nAndy Puglisi 9/15/20\n\nJacob Wetterling 10/3/20\n\nGavin Smith 10/30/20\n\nStacy Peterson 11/20/20\n\n\"Charley\" 12/25/20\n\nIzzy Johnson 12/31/20\n\nDorothy Johnson 12/31/20\n\nMy sister's and my mother's names. I looked at the journal confused and started turning pages trying to find an answer. I then found one. It was a few pages long similar to the scribbling that I'd paid no mind to earlier. I was done with the confusion and lack of answers so I sat down and read. Here's a quick transcription of what it said.\n\n\n\n12/31/20\n\nThe other day \"Charley\" made me mad. He made a class 1 mistake. The company is going to be ruined. Although I haven't had this company for even a year this makes me angry. I'm done with all of it. They've messed up for the last time. I'm going to punish them all. They deserve everything that I'll do. I have everything ready for this afternoon for retribution. I'll update this journal when I'm done.\n\nUpdate. My sister and mother know what I'm going to do and they're trying to stop me. They tried to talk me out of it, and I tried to be patient with them too. They couldn't understand why I'm doing this, or what measures I'm taking to make this world a better place. I got rid of their attitude and I'll deal with it later. For now, I'm going to leave them in the trapdoor room I found when I was looking for something. I'll just leave them there.\n\nI've done it. The building is no more. No evidence of what I've done, nothing linking it to me, and I think mom and sister will be quiet from now on. I'm going to bed, but it's been another good year. I'll leave this journal here to read later. \n\n\n\nThe journal entry ended there. I was still confused so I decided to go through other years. I looked back at the 2019 journal again. Not at the list, but at the entries. This is a transcription of what I read.\n\n\n\n12/31/19\n\nMother talked to me today. I was looking for something I lost, and I found a trapdoor that led to a hidden room. In there I found journals, and I had questions. She was very hesitant at first but after a little persuading, she decided to tell me. \n\nIt turns out that I've been reliving one year over and over and over for the past 11 years. The journals I write are just my brain remembering the past and what I had done. She tells me that I'd lived a horrible life before the accident. I think what I was planning to do tonight was what the accident was. I've decided I'll just not worry about it and head to bed.\n\n\n\nThat was the end of the entry. I was still more confused, and that left more questions than answers so I decided to take my questions to the root of the problem. The journal from 2008. I skimmed through and found a couple of answers. Here's a shortened transcription.\n\n\n\n12/31/08\n\nIt's happened. A level 1 mistake. I knew it was going to happen sometime in my lifetime, I just never thought it would happen in my first year on the job. I've been more than lenient just disposing of one at a time, but Charley... Charley was my final straw. His large mess-up just shows me how imperfect we all are. I've decided to purge everyone's flaws tonight.\n\nI have a plan. I've called a meeting for every single staff member. I'm going to bring a bomb. I see that these people and I are not fit to live in this world since all we do is bring imperfections. I don't want to die, but if I do it's a good price for the world's salvation. I may not update this journal anymore. I'll see later on if I do. \n\n\n\nIt started to come back to me. I remembered now. That night, the last night of all of 2008 I had called a meeting to celebrate New Year's. Or was it to celebrate? I had said I was bringing a bomb. The events at the party seemed fuzzy, but it was slowly coming into focus. Beneath each table was a bomb with a timer set to go off at midnight. There was a blast, and so many people... so many people died at my hands. I had killed each individual one of them.\n\nThose years in between though? What happened then? My mom's name, and my sister's name, why were they in the most recent journal? \n\n*Because they were people you disposed of. They wronged you. They got in your way, so you cleared your path.* If that was true then where were they? *Ever notice the two suspiciously life-size and feminine dolls in positions like they were trying to get away?* I looked back. The images came flashing back to my brain. I had smashed their heads in. Blood was everywhere. They were just trying to stop me from doing something wrong. *And you killed them in cold blood.* \n\nI went back and counted the names. 18 people. 18 people, I had robbed the life of. 2 of my own family. *19, it's 19 lives.* 19? How was it 19 lives? I asked myself. My stomach dropped. Had Ash moved the past two days? \n\nI climbed up the ladder in a hurry leaving the coppery smell and gruesome spectacle behind. I ran upstairs and swung open my door. Ash raised her head when I barged in. \n\n\"Thank God I didn't hurt you too,\" I said. But it wasn't Ash that heard me, it was the rats. They looked at me with beady eyes and scampered off showing a rotting corpse of a mangle and abused dog. *19* I thought. 19 lives of people and animals just trying to live their lives. What had I done? I sprinted out of the house and started wandering aimlessly. \n\nAmy Lynn Bradley\n\nAnthony Ross Allen\n\nSteven Koecher\n\nJohn Jackson\n\nWillow Blickenstaff\n\nNathan Carman\n\nDakota Carlson\n\nAva Baldwin\n\nMariah Cortez\n\nElizabeth Miller\n\nEmma Fillipoff\n\nAndy Puglisi\n\nJacob Wetterling\n\nGavin Smith\n\nStacy Peterson\n\n\"Charley\"\n\nIzzy Johnson\n\nDorothy Johnson\n\nAsh Johnson\n\nAll these names played in my mind on repeat as I walked. *What do they want? What can I even do now?* I asked myself. As if in response I lifted my head to see my workplace, which was coincidently 4 stories tall. It no longer had its beautiful glass windows but was taped off and looked extremely unstable. It looked like it could fall at the easiest touch, but that didn't matter. *Was this what you've walked an hour for every day for the past decade to be at?* If it was then it should be able to hold my weight. \n\nI started to ascend the once beautiful building's staircase. It was stable enough to carry me. I heard a crunch behind me as I ascended but I paid no mind to the sound. I just needed to get to the top and my troubles would soon be over.\n\nI stepped out of the stairwell into the open roof and I got on the edge. The sun was about to set, and it showed a myriad of burning oranges and reds. The blazing of the sun bore into my brain. A blazing sun that so many people never got to see again. A beautiful world so many people were taken away from. I guess in a sad way this might be life reminding me of that.\n\n\"Don't jump!\" I heard a familiar voice say behind me. I turned around and saw a gorgeous man.\n\n\"Callin? What are you doing here?\" I asked\n\n\"We had a date tonight, better question is, what're you doing up here?\"\n\nI took a hesitant step toward the edge. \"I've done some really bad things and I can't be here anymore. I've hurt so many people and I don't want to hurt anyone, especially not you.\" I responded. \n\nI saw a distinct fear in his eyes. The fear of losing someone that is of great importance to you. \"What're you talking about?! You haven't hurt me, or anyone that I know of. Just step away from the ledge.\" He pleaded. \n\nI considered not doing it for a moment, then all those faces I'd hurt flashed before my eyes. \"I'm sorry, I never wanted to hurt anyone,\" I said. Then, as he had asked, I stepped away from the ledge. \n\nThey say your life flashed before your eyes before you die. That must be true for as I fell, faces flashed before in my living consciousness. One loving as I was born, one angry I hadn't been perfect, another fearful of being fired. Then I saw his face. The man I jumped for. A sharp jawline, dazzling eyes, and a flawless body. The dinner we had, the time we enjoyed two nights ago, the care and fear in his eyes as I neared the edge. I hope it didn't affect him too much. Either way, he was better off without me.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading everyone! 2 things, this is my first story, so if you could please leave an updoot I would greatly appreciate it. Secondly if you can please leave suggestions on how I could improve the story. As a newbie I need all the help I can get.\n\nThanks,\nAziel",

        "text": "  \n\n“Hey, you alright man?” I asked Nick, nudging him on the arm with my elbow in some kind of attempt to bring him back to the real world.\n\nWork friends are a strange thing. There is not a single friend on this earth you see and talk to more than the ones you work with, and something about being stuck with the same handful of people in the exact same environment for a large portion of the day, within a large portion of the week makes for a real sort of kindred bond with the people you’re close with there, but in the air of that breath you have to acknowledge that you actually don’t know how well you know them at all. There’s a whole different life that they live when they’re not clocked in. You go home to your place, and they go home to theirs where you live a whole life that both you and your work friends are completely oblivious of, aside from whatever they decide to divulge to you when you clock back in on Monday. You might know how their weekend went, you might know what they enjoy doing when they’re not working, you get the highlights, but there’s a lot of dark between that illumination, and oddly enough that’s kind of okay. There’s your work friend, and there’s the “Other”, and in a weird way it simply makes sense.\n\nStill though, when you see someone almost every day you know when something’s off, and it didn’t take much more than a glance to tell that something was amiss. \n\nBy all intents and purposes, he looked the same as he always did. Five foot ten (ish) dude with glasses and a flat cap T-shirt and cargo shorts, two arms and two legs right where they should be, but I don’t know. Something about him was just . . . fuckey. It was like his entire energy was off, and the way he continued to thousand yard stare at the workplace announcement board after I’d just nudged him seemed to confirm my suspicions. \n\nPutting my fist in a ball, I lightly tapped it against the side of Nicks’ head three times. “Police! Wellness chec-“\n\nQuicker than I could finish my joke Nick sprang to life. His arm shot out and grabbed at my wrist with a speed I almost couldn’t comprehend as his head snapped sideways to face me. Locked in the vice-like grip of Nick’s my eyes grew wide as I met his face. \n\nMy friends’ normally friendly and smiley and almost jolly looking face was gone, in its place was a look I had never seen on him before, or on anyone for that matter. His upper lip was curled up into something I could only describe as a snarl. His lower lip frowning so deep that I could see all of his teeth that were clenched so tight I’d have sworn were about to shatter under the weight of each other, his eyes were wide and full of anger. No, not anger. That’s not the right word for it. Hatred maybe? That might be a better way to describe it, but it still doesn’t feel like enough to describe what I was seeing behind those eyes. There was a wildness too it. The kind of look that says, “I’m going to tear you apart and drink your blood”. \n\nAs quickly as he’d grabbed me, he let go. His arm snapping back down rigidly to his side in symmetry with the other. His feral expression had vanished without a trace, and was replaced with the same ‘out to lunch’ expression he’d been wearing when I’d first noticed him. Wordlessly, he turned away and walked off.\n\n“What’s up man? You alright?” The familiar voice of another work friend snapped me out of my shocked state. As I turned around to meet Demichael, the voices’ owner. His expression changed from cordial curiosity to concern as quickly as Nicks had gone from zombie to rabid animal. \n\n“Goddamn man you good? You see a ghost or somethin’ ? “\n\n“Ye . . . Yeah” I finally managed to croak. Words coming back as the boiling adrenaline subsided. \n\n“You talked to Nick? He say anything?”\n\n“Like what?” Demichael asked staring at Nicks sauntering figure as he shuffled his way to his work station. \n\n“I don’t know. Did I piss him off or something?” \n\n“If you did, I didn’t hear nothing about it. Did he say something to you?”\n\nMy mind went back to that expression, that tight grip, those crazy ass eyes. \n\n“No, I don’t know, it’s Monday. Maybe he just had a bad weekend. He’ll cool off.”\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWarehouse work is equal parts physically demanding, and mentally mundane. If you focus on the mental aspect you’ll go insane, so I always focused on the physical aspect. I soon got caught up in the trance of throwing boxes off pallets and onto the expedite belt. Sometime between three hours and three hundred years later I heard the unnaturally loud, yet endorphin inducing shout of our shift leader from across the warehouse. My favorite word in the world\n\n***Breeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaakkkk!***\n\nAs I made my way across the warehouse to the parking lot and my car I kept an eye out for Nick, maybe he’d had some time to relax his mind a little bit. When your bodies tired your mind tends to wear out too. I was hoping I could catch him and talk with him a bit before he broke off to eat lunch and I went off to eat Lucky Strikes, but Nick was nowhere to be found. \n\n“You seen Nick?” I asked one of the newer employees.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Nick, about my height. Wears a flat cap.”\n\n“What’s a flat cap?”\n\n“It’s like, one of those hats you see the old gangster wear.”\n\n“Oh, I know who you’re talking about. Nah, I aint seen him today.”\n\n“Alright, thanks man.” \n\nAs I sat outside smoking my cigarette my mind went back to Nick’s face. I’ve been working with him for almost a year now. I’d never seen him look that way. I’d never seen anyone look that way, not even in Iraq. \n\n*It was just too . . .* *I don’t know, primal.* I thought to myself as I exhaled, a think plume of smoke billowing out and dissipating within the cold night air. *That was barely human*.\n\nWalking back in I stopped by the restroom. If you don’t relieve yourself on breaks, then you’ll regret it. You go even if you don’t have to. As I walked into the white tile covered room the automatic lights came on and I nearly jumped.\n\nStanding in front of the sinks gazing intently into the mirror in front of him was Nick. Arms at his side, same blank look on his face. Not moving, not blinking. Just staring at himself. \n\n“Nick, Jesus dude you scare the crap out of me-“ Before I could finish what I was saying an unsettling realization commandeered my voice.\n\n*The automatic lights came on when I walked through the bathroom door.* my short term memory reminded me with warning. *That thing is so fucking fickle you breath too heavy it kicks on, and it’s gotta take at least 30 minutes to kick back off.* As my conscious evaluated the facts of what I was looking at the twos and twos made a four that began to put me on a very nervous edge. \n\nNick was not only staring at himself in a mirror in a pitch-black bathroom. He’d been doing It completely still for a long time. \n\n*“ Nah, I aint seen him today.”* The new hires voice echoed in my head. \n\n“Nick, bud, how long you been in here man? Talk to me.” \n\nAt first I thought there was only silence, but as soon as I noticed his hands were now balled into fists, I began to hear a low sound. Deep and guttural and fierce. \n\nGrowls.\n\nI began to step back as Nick sprang to life. Sprinting across the tile floor towards me. The once silent bathroom now filled with a frenzy of bloodcurdling screaming. \n\nEvery bit of air abandoned my lungs as he barreled into me. Like I’d been hit by a truck. I felt the floor give way from underneath me, and heard the crack of my head against the floor as bright light and searing hot pain blinded me. No sooner had my vision begun to return than I was blinded again, this time the blunt explosive pain of knuckles slamming into my face with tremendous force, I managed to turn my head to the side just in time for another against my cheek bone. \n\nAdrenaline kept me awake, and survival instinct took over. As Nicks’ fist came down for another heavy blow I moved my head completely away from the impact. I could hear a crunching sound beside me as his fist met the hard tile floor. Before he could pull his arm back up, I threw my left fist at him as hard as I could manage. The punch landed, and Nick swayed back a little bit. It wasn’t a lot, but it was just enough for me to pull myself out from under him. As he lunged towards me I brought my foot up and kicked in his direction. It found its mark square against his face, and he howled like an injured wolf as he reeled back and braced for another charge. \n\nClumsily and effortfully I pulled myself up, and as quickly as I could I charged him first. Screaming once more at the top of his lungs he threw his arms up to grip my chest as I ducked low and gripped his waist. With all my strength I managed to push him into wall behind him, and then off to the left into a bathroom stall, as I released my grip the momentum made him stumble and crash loudly into the toilet, knocking off the plastic lid in the process. \n\nDespite being punched, kicked hard in the face, and now thrown hard into ceramic, the wild animal that was once my friend remained unphased, and his determination to destroy me now seemed stronger than ever. He rushed at me again as I slammed the stall door shut, and propped myself against it with everything I had. I could feel the door moving with every barrage of weight he used to try and slam it back open, as the weight pushed me forward, I’d throw mine to slam it back shut. \n\nIt was then I looked to my left and saw the new hire from earlier Standing in the bathroom doorway, eyes wide with shock and disbelief. \n\n“Call the fucking cops you idiot!” I screamed at the top of my lungs over Nicks animal like bellows as another forceful push from the door threatened to send me reeling forward . . .\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n“Ma’am” I said as respectfully as I could muster as I approached the crying woman in the corner of the hospitals waiting room. \n\nAs the woman wiped her eyes and looked up at me I found myself reminded of the work friend paradox once more. I couldn’t rightly justify my surprise at Nick having a mother, I mean of course he has a mother. Everyone’s got a mother, but at the same time . . . who’d have thought Nick had a mother?\n\nThe look on her face upon noticing me. Followed by the involuntary gasp reminded me that I indeed looked every bit as bad as I felt. \n\nA broken nose, a concussion, three missing teeth on my left, and a black eye that was undoubtedly swollen shut by now. \n\n“My Nicholas did that?” \n\n“I . . .I don’t think it was your boy. I’ve known Nick for a while now, that’s not him.” \n\nMuffled screaming behind the door from somewhere in the back of the hospital seemed to affirm my words. \n\nFour cops and three tasers had finally brought Nick down, and before he could even be sent to the hospital he had to be sedated. \n\n“I just don’t understand!” She blurted out almost too loudly, as though she were being interrogated for the assault and battery she didn’t commit. The words came out as ‘ I just don’t understand’ but they sounded like ‘He’s my son take me instead!’ \n\n“I just wanted you to know I’m not going to press charges, and if there’s anything I can do you just let me know alright?” I said nodding my cracked eggshell of a head towards the inner portions of the hospitals. \n\n“He’s a fucking mad dog right now, but he’s our mad dog.” \n\nA sharp guffaw of laughter from Nicks mom before tears began to well once more. \n\n“They just don’t understand.” She said effortfully through tears. “He has no history of this, his toxicology thing came back clean, they don’t think it’s rabies or anything like that. It’s like he’s . . . Possessed or something I just don’t know!”\n\n“I’m sure they’re going to figure it out. It’ll be okay.” \n\nUnconvinced by my horrible attempt at comfort she once more broke into sobs. For awhile I stood there not knowing what to do before I decided leaving her be was the best thing to do for the moment. As I turned to walk away her voice stopped me. \n\n“Wait, actually. There is something you could do. If it isn’t too much to ask.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I turned the key on the locking mechanism, and opened the door to the dark interior of Nicks apartment I couldn’t help but smile once more at the strange conundrum of our friendship. \n\n*Lookie there, he’s got a place he lives in. just like me.*\n\nI fumbled around against the walls for a little bit until I managed to find the light switch. I flicked it upwards and illuminated the well-kept apartment. \n\n*Okay,* I told myself as I made my way through the living room, scanning the furniture around me as I made my way. *Grab some clothes, find a phone, no more snooping than needs snooped.*\n\nMy head and face still ached, but luckily for me doctors have pills for such things, and they were doing a good job. I tried to remember the name of the prescription, but the scientific jumble jargon of its name alluded me for the time being. \n\nGrabbing the clothes was easy enough. When you work with someone every day you tend to know what they wear after all. His cellphone however was a different story, and trying to find it resulted in admittedly a lot more snooping than I had originally intended. His gun collection was impressive, his history related stuff as well. I’d known he was into stuff like that, but to see them first hand put a whole new level of concrete into prior conversations we’d had about it. \n\nIt was amid this snooping I heard a soft knock. \n\nAt first, I thought someone had thrown something at his window. It was unmistakably the sound of something against glass, and the suddenness of didn’t let me catch where the noise had come from. Still and silent I listened for a few moments before hearing it again. \n\nIt was coming from the room across from Nicks bedroom. I hadn’t been in there yet, but I assumed it was the bathroom. I opened the door and sitting on the sink in Nicks bathroom was the small rectangular shape of a cell phone. I flicked the light on and stepped towards the sink, still listening intently for the knocking sounds I had heard just moments prior. \n\nAs I gazed up at the mirror I stepped back and let out an involuntary scream. The reflection that should have been staring back at me in the mirror of Nicks bathroom was not me. \n\nTo my horror, beyond my belief, the image in the mirror’s reflection was Nick’s, eyes wide with fear. Dark circles under his eyes, banging frantically against the glass. His lips were moving, but I couldn’t hear any noise. Just the faint knocking of his fists against the inside of the mirror. \n\nShocked beyond comprehension, unable to process it, unable to even react to it. All I could do was stare at the image of my friend in complete fear and confusion. \n\n*Call the fucking Cops you idiot! Call the fucking cops you idiot!*\n\nSnapping back into reality I fumbled around in my phone pocket for my cellphone and unlocked it to call 911. It was then I noticed the twenty plus missed calls on my screen. The number was Nick’s mothers. Just below was a series of text notifications. My heart sank into my stomach as I read the words of the most recent text. Each one tumbling my heart further down like a Jacobs’ Ladder \n\n**New Message: Nicks Mom**\n\n**Nicks escaped they can’t find him call me!!!!!**\n\nAs I looked back up to the image of my friend’s mirror shaped prison the lights in the house flicked off, shrouding everything in complete darkness. The light of my phone against the blackness of the windowless bathroom making everything pitch black. \n\nIt was then I heard a noise coming from somewhere within the apartment.\n\nA low sound, deep and guttural and fierce. . .\n\nGrowls.\n\nI looked around desperately like a cornered animal trying to find its way out of a trap, but I knew that it was hopeless. If I tried to make a break for the door that thing that looked like Nick would certainly find me. If I stayed here in the bathroom then the same fate would surely await me. As I looked around helplessly for some kind of divine intervention or break in my luck, something, anything I hadn’t noticed before. I suddenly remembered the gun collection in Nick’s room. Just across the hall. \n\nNone of them would be loaded, but one had a bayonet on it. \n\nAs my eyes adjusted, I placed my hand on the doorknob to the bathroom and took several heavy breaths. \n\n*Get across the hall, grab the gun with the big ass knife on the front, make a break for the front door.* \n\n*Get across the hall, grab the gun with the big ass knife on the front, make a break for the front door.* \n\nI guess in my nervous anticipation I hadn’t noticed how silent the apartment had gotten. That the growls had stopped, as I threw the bathroom door open and went to sprint towards the bedroom I was met with a stiff force that almost knocked me onto the floor. \n\nAs I recoiled and looked towards the threshold of the doorway I could see “Other Nicks” Shadowed frame standing right on the other side of it. \n\nBefore I could react, he charged at me. If there had been more space in that little bathroom, he’d have certainly knocked me over and probably beat me to death right there in the darkness, but the impact of his charge instead knocked me into the bathroom sink about waist high. Though the impact against the structure sent shooting pain into my hip the height and weight of it was enough to keep me upright. As “Other Nick” charged me again I threw myself upright and placed both of my hands on his back. Using his momentum to throw his head into the bathroom mirror. \n\nAs it turns out this involuntary movement saved my life. I had expected to maybe hear a shatter, or at least the loud thud of “Other Nicks” head against the glass, but instead there was no sound at all. Through the darkness I could see his arms waving around frantically, but where there was once a head I could now only see the tops of his shoulders.\n\nFor a moment all I could do was stand there in a state of shock. My mind could hardly process what I was looking at, but as I blinked and stared in fear and confusion the picture before me began to click in my head. Somehow, someway. The same entity that had trapped Nick in the mirror had just trapped “Other Nick” in the same mirror. At least from the neck up. As “Other Nick” continued to flail and attempt to pull himself out of the glass I realized his situation was a hopeless one. He’d decapitate himself before he could pull himself out of the prison I’d accidentally trapped him in. Though it was still dark in the bathroom I could make out Nicks shape standing as close to glass as possible. Moving his arms around with a similar franticness. Knowing there was nothing more that I could do I clumsily and desperately stumbled my way out of the apartment and called the only entity I thought could possibly help. 9-1-1. As It turned out this was a bit out of their league as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s been a week since I discovered Nick trapped inside the bathroom mirror. His entire apartments been shut down, the other tenants evicted and ‘Temporarily’ set up far away in new apartments. They’re saying it’s because of black mold. I might be the only non-government worker who knows that’s not true. \n\nI don’t know why they didn’t take me somewhere. Lock me in a cell or “Suicide” me. Maybe they think all of this sounds way too outlandish for anyone to possibly believe, but I couldn’t just keep something like this to myself. I made it a week without telling anyone before the guilt and fear of it all just kind of took over, I guess. I don’t know what I hate more, my inability to keep a secret, or my ability to abandon a friend I know needs help for that long.  I don’t know how long Nick can stay in that mirror without starving to death. I don’t know how long anyone can stay in that mirror with “Other Nick” growling and screaming, trying to kill anything that gets in its way. If I’ve ever prayed for anything it’s that God would make all of this just a horrible dream, or to save my friend from the horrible fate he’s been thrown into, but I honestly never really believed that God was real. . . Then again, I never believed that any of this could be real either. . .",

It was so dry, the texture akin to snakeskin.\n\nI racked my mind for the possible cause, but couldn’t think of any.\n\nNot only did it look disgusting but it itched like absolute hell.\n\nI found myself scratching absentmindedly.\n\nI scratched so hard that I drew blood. I only noticed when I glimpsed my red fingertips. My nail-beds were clogged with strips of skin.\n\nI finally realized that something was wrong when I went to get my hair done.\n\nI went to my stylist to get my standard summer box braids.\n\nWhen she was done, she dipped my braids into a boiling pot of water and carefully wrapped my hair in a towel so I wouldn’t get burned.\n\nWhen she took the towel away, she gasped, and my heart thumped painfully.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I asked, but she didn’t answer.\n\nI snatched her mirror off the table and peered at my reflection.\n\nI screamed.\n\nEvery braid had come out of my head.\n\nSome clung to my scalp hanging on by bloody, viscous threads.\n\n A trail of dark blood ran down my skull, and I felt and watched as it trickled slowly down the bridge of my nose. \n\nI slammed the mirror down and ran outside to my car. I blocked the stylist as she repeatedly called me to ask for payment.\n\nIt was only when I was halfway home that I cried.\n\nBy the time I got home, all of my hair was gone—every single strand and most, if not all, of my scalp.\n\nMy skin fell off in long bloody strips. My face formed boils that burst and spurted foul yellow pus.\n\nMy eyes have always been my best feature. They were my favorite part of me.\n\nAnd now they were wet with thick mucous and yellow like the eyes of a reptile.\n\nEvery time I looked at my reflection, I cried.\n\nWhat else did I have if I was no longer beautiful?\n\n I was not known for kindness. My personality did not win me friends.\n\nI have always been an indescribable beauty. The kind of beauty that countries go to war over.\n\nI don’t look like myself anymore. Hell, I vaguely pass as a human.\n\nI’ve been holed up in my bathroom for days. I broke the mirror with my fist and shattered it along with my bones.\n\nThere are shards everywhere. Reflections of me.\n\nI can’t escape it. I can’t run from myself.\n\nI give up. To the Goddess or God that has cursed me, you win.\n\nI just have one request.\n\nI ask that you take what I love the most. I beg you to take my eyes.\n\nI no longer want to see what I look like. I’m tired of my soul’s reflection staring at me.\n\nI want to be able to imagine what I used to be.\n\nI want to get lost in the memory of my beauty. I never want to forget it.",

        "text": " \n\nMy parents moved into this house with my older siblings and I before I was even one year old.  And we lived in that house for over 20 years.  Strange things happen sporadically over the years we lived there.  It got to the point that I refuse to even step foot back in.\n\nThese are what I can remember since it has been a few years after we all moved out of that house.\n\nI was around 5 or 6 and it was storming outside.  My siblings and I were watching TV.  Every now and then we would hear the front door close, even though the door was already closed to begin with.  Our parents were already asleep in their room.  After maybe hearing it close 5 times I rushed upstairs and forced myself to sleep.  That was the only time it has happened.\n\nOne time when I was in 9th grade I woke up in the middle of the night.  In my sleepy haze I thought I saw a woman in her mid 40s with blonde hair.  She was standing in the corner, but that was where a dresser stood as well.  I blinked to try and clear my head, but that woman was gone after that.  It freaked me out.  I thought I was losing my mind and seeing things that weren’t there.\n\nNow this event occurred when I was in college.  I was home alone, and no appliance was on, or my laptop was running.  It was basically quiet in the house.  Then I heard two muffled voices. A man and a woman conversing with one another.  I looked around the house to try and find out where it was coming from but found nothing.  I was still alone in that house.\n\nOther times when all of us would leave and come back after dark; we would see that the basement light was on.  This was when we all stopped going down to the basement long ago.\n\nAt other times the pets that we had would speak to an empty space or just stare at nothing.\n\nAfter a beloved pet died my older sister and I would sometimes hear something running up and down the stairs.\n\nMy sister and a friend of hers witnessed the TV turn on by itself.  The remote was nowhere near them.\n\nAnother time she saw a figure in the middle of her room.  After a second it vanished.\n\nShe would see a figure in a tree outside her window but would turn around when she changed her clothes.\n\nAnd of course, things would disappear and sometimes turn back up.  Whatever not turn back up, we just replace or accept the fact that it is gone.\n\nYeah, we were able to endure a lot.  We could not move out because we did not have a lot of money.\n\nMy siblings and I moved out of that house and a few years ago my parents followed.  And we have not experienced anything strange or abnormal since.",

        "text": "I don’t know when it started, but for the past few years the same girl has been in every single one of my dreams. I don’t know her name, but I would be able to describe her every feature.\n\nIn my dreams, she never speaks. She just follows me around, staring at me, regardless of what’s going on in the dream. I could be having a discussion with a monk who hates the West in a monastery and she would be a few feet away, lingering and listening.\n\nAt first it freaked me out that this lady kept appearing in my dreams, but after a few weeks I got used to her. In fact, I actually started to enjoy her presence. It was nice to have some company. \n\nI hate to admit it, but I actually started looking forward to sleeping just so I could see her.\n\nAnyways, I was in the city one day going about my business. I had to attend this big meeting downtown. As I was walking down the street, I caught a glimpse of a girl walking in the opposite direction with red hair who looked awfully familiar. I slowed my pace and turned around. I started following her.\n\nAll I could see was the back of her head. Her hair looked like the girl’s. It was the exact length, waviness, and color. I followed her for a few blocks, which was hard to do considering how much she turned and weaved, until she walked into a coffee shop where I got a good look at her face.\n\nIt was her. It was her blue eyes, her sparse freckles. It was her chin and her lips. Her ears and her nose. It was her, and she was even more beautiful in person.\n\nFor a few moments I just stared at her. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. She noticed me gazing at her, looked quickly and then looked away. I must have been making her nervous.\n\nI worked up the nerve, then approached her and introduced myself.\n\n“Hi, I’m Aaron.”\n\nShe didn’t say anything. She didn’t even look at me. I repeated myself, maybe she didn’t hear me?\n\n“Hi…I’m Aaron.”\n\nShe looked up with watery eyes. \n\n“Get the fuck away from me.”\n\nI was taken aback. What had I done? I was incredibly confused. \n\n“Excuse me, what?” I asked.\n\n“Get away from me or I’ll call the police.”\n\nI stared in disbelief for a few moments.\n\n“Wait, but-“ \n\n“Please get away from me. Please stop following me. Just leave me alone.”\n\nShe started backing away slowly and seemed like she was about to call for help. \n\n“I’m sorry” I said.\n\nI turned around and left the shop. What the fuck was her problem? All I did was try to talk to her. I was angry, why didn’t she just talk to me? She’s supposed to be in my life, right?\n\nI knew I couldn’t just let her go that easily. I waited across the street until she left the shop and this time I followed her more carefully. She eventually arrived at an apartment building after about 15 minutes of walking (why doesn’t this bitch just take the subway?)\nI couldn’t just follow her up to her room, and no one in there could buzz me in, so I waited outside for a light to turn on. After about a minute, I saw it. 4th floor, 3 in. I went to the side of the building and found the fire escape. I climbed up until I could hear what was going on inside the apartment.\n\nShe was sobbing, talking to someone on the phone.\n\n“please, are you going to be home soon? I’m terrified.” \n\nWas it because of me?\n\n“Yes i’m 100% sure it’s him. It’s him.” she said.\n\nShe paused for a moment, listening to the other person on the line.\n\nAngrily, she replied “I think I would know what he fucking looks like Todd I see him every night.”\n\nI started breathing heavy. What did she mean? Who was Todd?\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the door opened. I peered through the window and saw her running into the arms of a man. Tall, handsome, and fit. Taller than me. More handsome than me. Better body than me. Upon seeing what I assumed to be Todd, an intense rage came over me and I smashed the window open.\n\nShe screamed. \n\nI jumped inside, ripped the curtain rod off the wall, and when Todd came charging at me I struck him in the head. Out cold. \n\nShe screamed more. “Please, please get away from me. Please don’t kill me please.”\n\n I didn’t know what to do.\n\n\n\n\nLater that night, when I fell asleep, the red haired girl, who turned out to be named Melissa, was not there.\nInstead, following me was a girl with dark eyes and dark hair. I was instantly in love.",

        "text": "Hospitals have always made me feel uncomfortable. The overstimulating sounds of the machines constantly beeping, the smell of bleach and antiseptic lingered around the rooms making their way into the hallways. Most of my soul contracts were in the hospital so you’d think I’d be used to it by now but the sounds of the nurses rushing around, pens scribbling on clipboards and family members crying and mourning their sick relatives always made me feel dizzy and uneasy. I always looked out of place loitering outside some poor person’s room waiting to collect their souls. I wondered if the hospital staff was ever suspicious of me but since my mother works here, I guess they just assume I’m here to see her. I have to be close as once the soul leaves the body; they need a reaper to guide them to the other side or they become confused and emotional choosing to stay with their family meaning they become ghosts and honestly new souls are much easier to persuade to cross over than ghosts are. \n\nThe contract stipulated that I needed to collect Mr. Walters' soul at 14:20. When I checked my watch, it was already 14:43. That was unusual; souls didn't normally take this long to seek me out. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to sense his presence. Maybe he had wandered off, which was unusual when a reaper was present but not unheard of. But there was nothing. It was completely silent. Frustration bubbled inside me; the contract was incorrect. I had other things to do today, like finish my assessment for Professor James, who wouldn't grant me any more extensions. And I had a date with Rob tonight but that all must come second to the souls as it’s my moral obligation to make sure they reach their final destination but that didn’t mean I had to be happy about it. \n\nAnother thirty minutes passed by, and Mr. Walters didn’t appear, and I simply couldn’t wait any longer. I emailed head office to advise of the oversight and started to head home. As I was walking down the damp dark stairwell of the hospital I could see a shadow at the bottom, waiting. I felt a sense of fear and dread wash over me, something I’ve never felt before, it was almost as if I’d never feel happiness again. I wanted to run but my legs wouldn’t move, I wanted to scream but my vocal cords felt paralyzed. \n\nThe shadow stepped out from the darkness and to my surprise it was a man dressed in a green flannel and skinny jeans but as my eyes focused, I could see it was a very handsome man, he has jet black untamed hair, his jaw line was sharp with chiselled cheekbones and his eyes were captivating, they were maroon and reflected red off the lighting. That’s when I realised, he wasn’t human. “Dalia?” he questioned softly. I still couldn’t move so I just nodded. He smirked “Death has called a meeting and we’re all required to attend; he advised you haven’t been to the office before and to escort you”. “Uhm” that’s all I could manage to say, I must have looked uncomfortable as the man spoke again “apologies I haven’t introduced myself. My name is Samael. I work in head office in the defective soul department.” he said, “so you’re a reaper?” I questioned. “An unconventional one, yes” he smirked again.  \n\nSamael made me feel uncomfortable, but I had no reason to doubt him, who else would know I’m a reaper? It’s a secret I’ve been keeping for the last three years and someone else knowing even if I didn’t know them gave me a sense of relief. Samael gestured for me to follow him, he opened the door to the ground floor of the hospital and started walking. I followed him but remained a few steps behind probably looking like a lost puppy following its master. As I followed Samael through the halls of the hospital, the memories of that day, the day I came into my reaper powers flooded back. My grandpa was in this hospital for his final days, I was only eighteen and it was the first time I saw anyone die. I was a bit scared of him, my once loving happy grandpa was led in the bed, covered in bruises, his pale skin was grey, and I remember thinking he looked like a zombie. I still remember the way his rib cage rattled when he breathed. \n\nMy grandma and mother left me alone with him whilst they went to the café below to get us a beverage. My grandfather’s breathing became shallower and before I could press the call button, I saw a blinding white light surround him. I looked up and saw my grandfather standing over us smiling and a disembodied voice started to speak, it wasn’t my grandfather, it was a woman and told me to guide him to the other side. I didn’t understand what was happening at first and out of instinct I grabbed my grandpa’s hand as he always made me feel safe, if I was scared, he’d always hold my hand and give it a reassuring squeeze. As I touched his hand, I felt a surge of energy flow through my body, it felt like 1000 electric shocks at once, but I knew, I knew in that moment what my destiny was and that I was a reaper and I needed to collect souls. \n\nSamael and I arrived at the office, and I was surprised to see it was an actual office the office is an open-plan room with desks lining the walls. There were people on the phones, photocopying, writing, and laughing at the coffee machine. The room was well-lit with bright overhead lights, and there were large windows along one wall that provide a view of the outside world which looked artificial, it was too perfect to be real. The desks were made of a light-coloured wood and are cluttered with papers, files, and office supplies. There were posters on the walls with motivational slogans like \"We’re dead serious about collecting souls\" and \"Our team always delivers...souls to the afterlife.\" The carpet is a deep blue colour, and there are potted plants scattered throughout the room. Overall, the office has a professional, yet relaxed atmosphere. It really made me feel uneasy and slightly freaked out although it looked like a human office, it lacked humanity. It was cold and lifeless. \n\nAs Samael and I made our way through the office, we were suddenly stopped by an older woman, perhaps around 50 years old. She had a short blonde bob and was dressed in a vibrant pink dress that matched her lipstick. Her demeanour was unfriendly, and she snarled at Samael, \"You're late.\" When he gave an unapologetic smirk and blamed the traffic, the woman didn't seem impressed. She curled her upper lip in disdain and said, \"I guess that's why you don't send a demon to do a reaper's job. We have a meeting in an hour, and you're excused.\" Samael scoffed and walked away without another word, leaving me standing there awkwardly. The woman's overpowering perfume made me choke, and I struggled to find something to say. Finally, I managed to muster a weak smile and blurted out, \"Wow, this seems like a nice place to work. Can't believe it's my first time here.\" \n\nThe woman turned to me and smiled softly and introduced herself as the head of the Soul Collection Bureau's Human Resources department. She explained that while the office primarily served non-human entities, my unique abilities had allowed me to become a reaper in my human life which when discovered was a hot topic between the managers but ultimately it was decided I’d be allowed to reap. This was a rare occurrence, as most reapers were chosen from the deceased for their skills and qualities to serve the higher purpose of soul collecting. \n\nKaren went on to say that my presence in the office could be unsettling to some of the other staff, which was why it had been decided that I would work remotely, receiving my contracts via email. She understood that I likely had many questions about the workings of the bureau but cautioned that not all information could be freely shared. As a human, there were certain limitations to what I could know and understand. I didn’t press the matter any further as Karen didn’t seem like the kind of woman who’d answer me anyway. \n\nKaren explained to me that the boss had called an important meeting, requiring the attendance of everyone, including me. She asked me to sit quietly at a desk in the far-left corner, not to draw any attention to myself, and that she would come to collect me when the meeting started. As I sat at the desk, I couldn't help but feel isolated and disconnected from the rest of the office. The desk was old, and the paint on the walls was peeling off at the bottom, giving it a musty smell. \n\nAs I eavesdropped on the conversations around me, I began to understand more about the Soul Collection Bureau. It was surprising to learn that it was run like a typical business. Death was the CEO, but he didn't actually collect souls. That was beneath him. The only ones he answered to were God and the Devil. My department was responsible for collecting souls in the northwest of England, which was a small team, but it was in the head office, so my colleagues got the pleasure of having Death hovering over their shoulders However, I couldn't shake the feeling that my presence was unwanted in the office. Karen's insistence on keeping me isolated made me wonder if there was more to it than just not wanting to distract others. Perhaps there was something about me that made the staff uncomfortable. I tried my best to ignore the stares and whispers coming from my colleagues and hoped the meeting would begin soon. \n\nAs I sat there, my mind wandered back to Samael. He was a demon, yet he didn't fit the description of the evil, soul-destroying beings I had heard about. Why would they send him to collect me? And what was he doing working for the Soul Collection Bureau? My confusion only deepened. My anxiety started to take over and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets and mysteries lay within the Soul Collection Bureau. As I sat alone at my desk, I felt a strange mixture of fear and curiosity. What kind of world had I stumbled into? What kind of beings were lurking in the shadows, unseen and unknown by the human world? And most importantly, what was my role in all of this? Death clearly wanted me here. As much as I wanted to push these thoughts aside and return to my mundane life, sure I was collecting souls, but it was through email communication I didn’t realise the extent of this business but I’m here now and there’s no going back. \n\nI heard a loud \"Ah-hem\" and looked up to see Karen standing above me. \"Follow me please,\" she said, gesturing for me to come with her. As we walked down the office, I couldn't help but feel the weight of the whispers and stares coming from my co-workers. My cheeks burned with embarrassment, and I couldn't understand why they were talking about me. \n\nKaren led me into a meeting room at the far end of the office, where five people were already seated. Samael was among them. I didn't recognize the others, so I made my way to the only empty chair and sat down. I avoided eye contact and looked at the floor, hoping to avoid drawing any more attention to myself. Suddenly, the door opened again, and my attention was drawn towards a tall, cloaked figure who walked in with an air of importance. He removed his cloak to reveal a scary-looking man with a bald head and a tattoo running down the side of his skull. His eyes were black, and his face had sharp features. It was Death, and I couldn't believe I was actually in the presence of the Grim Reaper. Despite not introducing himself yet, I knew instantly who he was. \n\nDeath cleared his throat before speaking, \"Thank you all for attending,\" he began, \"I won't bore you with formalities and get straight to the point. Souls have been going missing, and we don't know why.\" As Death continued to explain the gravity of the situation, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease in the pit of my stomach. Lucifer was apparently the client who had visited earlier, and his underworld was in chaos without the missing souls. It wouldn't be long before God noticed, and that could spell trouble for everyone involved. \n\nAs Death spoke, I glanced around the table and noticed that the other people were managers from other reaper sites. They reported no unusual goings-on at their locations, so it seemed to be confined to this particular area for now. \n\nKaren spoke up from behind Death, and I realized I had forgotten she was even there. \"Sir, if I may,\" she interjected, her eyes narrowing towards Samael, \"soul stealing is dark magic. Maybe we should be questioning the dark lord and his demons.\" The tension in the room was apparent as everyone shifted in their seats. I had a feeling Karen shouldn't have said that.",

I was not lying when I told you I come from a long line of woodworkers. My grandfather worked on the wood paneling of the palace of Versailles before leaving France. In Quebec, he found acclaim and respect as a master of his trade. My father followed him, as did I. By the time I came of age, I wanted to establish my own reputation. By then, though we were still tradesmen, our family’s stature had increased.  We moved in higher circles than we once had, and were invited to balls and soirees by our grateful clients. \n\nIt was in 1730 at one of those affairs that I met a woman. I was wandering the gardens of a grand *seigneur*, already too drunk, looking for some fresh air. It was a summer evening, when every patch of green is alive with the sounds of crickets and locusts. I had been admiring the soft blooms of a rose bush, when I noticed that those sounds had ceased entirely. And that is when I first saw her.\n\nWhen she appeared to me, I thought she was a hallucination. A beautiful woman with powdered hair, sumptuously dressed in the latest fashion, but entirely in black damask threaded with gold. She reclined on settee in a stone grotto, a gigantic, rather wild-looking pointy-eared dog beside her, which she stroked with languid, indulgent gestures. She pointed at me with a slender jeweled finger and smiled.\n\n‘Boy, beautiful boy. Come closer.’ She stretched out her hand to me.\n\nI had no choice but to obey, gliding towards her as though I was skating on ice. I took that perfumed hand and kissed it. Her smile deepened and my lips felt heavy, as though I had just ingested poison, the kind of poison that kills slowly and fills men with delirium. I reclined next to her, head spinning, as she shooed off her animal, which retreated with a snarl. \n\n‘René Allaire,’ she whispered into my ear. ‘Humble little carpenter.’\n\nI opened my mouth to ask how she knew me, but she silenced me with the touch of a finger. My entire body felt suspended in a hypnotic daze, as though we were the only two people on the entire continent. \n\n‘Beautiful boy, what do you desire?’ Her voice was like a hiss. She placed her hand on my cheek and suddenly we were dancing in a grand palace with walls covered in carved, gilded wood. I wore a coat embroidered with gold thread and rings of priceless jewels. *I would give you this and more if you would be mine.* *Come to me and I will make you greater than anything in your imagination.* She and I were laughing, and laughing, and laughing.\n\nWe were back in the garden and she was kissing me. I was helpless, falling deeper and deeper underwater, inhibitions fading like the light of the surface. However, even in this state, I noticed there was something terribly wrong with her feet. Every insect, worm, and vermin in the vicinity was writhing underneath the foot of her black silk shoes. Spiders climbed out of the bushes and crawled over her arms and shoulders. Like lightning, the word came to me, jarring me from my stupor. *Witch.* With my waning strength, I managed to pull myself from her embrace. I stumbled, backing away from her.\n\nHer lovely face darkened, transforming into a mask of surprise and rage. Her voice throbbed inside my head as though coming from behind my ears, behind my eyes.  I howled in pain. *I will not be denied, René.* *You are already mine.* *Come to me, or your existence will be nothing but suffering.*\n\n“No!” I shouted. I pulled out the crucifix under my shirt and cravat. She scowled.\n\n‘Your trinkets will not save you.’\n\nShe disappeared, along with her dog, leaving me sweating and breathless. \n\nShe made good on her promise. My nights were filled with nothing but her, mocking me in my dreams, tormenting me until the rising of the sun, leaving me tired and miserable. During the days, I would catch her visage in the corner of a mirror, in the reflection of a pond, diabolically grinning, eyes burning like coals, teeth and tongue black as she laughed. I distanced myself from my increasingly concerned family, lest she decide to torment one of them in an attempt to get to me. I rented a room from an old widow and avoided my friends and my business.\n\nBut the one connection I could not bear to sever was that of my betrothed, Marie-Anne. She was the daughter of a prosperous merchant of furs and I cared for her very much. I became more careful and circumspect about where we would meet, only in churches or on other hallowed ground and only during the day. She fretted about me, how hollow and haunted I had become. She begged me to attend a dinner her father was hosting for some of his colleagues. I was so weary, and so sick of disappointing her that I acquiesced. \n\nWhen I arrived that evening to the home of Marie-Anne, I was surprisingly calm. The witch had hardly plagued me all day and I thought, with all the naivete of youth, that I had bested her. The dinner was exceedingly merry, the wine flowed freely and all were in good spirits.\n\nIn the midst of the grand feast, an elaborate trout pie was served. I eagerly brought a piece to my mouth, but it tasted of ash. I spit it out, a strange feeling descending over me as I looked around the table. Everyone was partaking of the fish with great gusto, including Marie-Anne at my side. I tried another bite, but again, it tasted of nothing but ash. Scanning the room once more, my eye caught the grand rococo mirror over the mantle. A serving girl stood by herself in a corner, her face staring into it with grin that was far too wide. Her reflection was that of the witch, black teeth clattering, laughing silently at me.\n\nI stood and staggered backwards in terror, grabbing the sleeve of Marie-Anne.\n\n‘Stop eating,’ I said in a frenzied whisper. She looked at me as though I were mad. One by one, each person at the table, mouths full of fish, began to laugh at me, maniacally, as though they had lost control of themselves completely. Then, their eyes bulged, their hands clawed at their necks as though they were being burned by the food they consumed. They began to vomit so violently that many fell to the floor. I caught Marie Anne and held her as she convulsed, her face a mask of utter terror, her skin clammy and greenish pale. With one last heave, blood poured out of her mouth and she fell limp in my arms. \n\nThe room was silent. Every single guest had met the same fate. The serving girl in the corner still stood staring in the mirror, smile gone, face completely blank, only her own reflection for company. I fled the house of horrors, the face of the witch greeting me in every window I passed. \n\nI did not dare go back to my home. Instead, I went to the only place a good French Catholic would go and the one place the Witch could not follow me, inside a church. \n\nThe priest took pity on me, though it was the middle of the night and I looked like I had been through the circles of Hell. I told the priest that I was being plagued by a witch. Despite what modern people think, not all places and peoples of the past were obsessed with the persecution of witches and witchcraft. That was a phenomenon of a different time and place. Still, we took seriously encounters with the diabolical. \n\nThe priest told me that if I were to cleanse my soul through confession and receive the Eucharist in that state of grace, the witch would not be able to haunt me. I readily agreed. When the priest said the words of absolution, I heard a great shrieking, wrathful cry that reverberated through the confessional.  At Mass the following morning I received the Eucharist with joy, the first peace I had since that night in the garden. \n\nWhen I left the church, I felt cautiously optimistic. I wandered the streets of Quebec City, and nowhere did I see her vile face, hear her wicked laugh. While the protection of the sacraments heartened me, I knew I could not go back to the people I loved. When I closed my eyes, I was not haunted by the Witch, but by the corpse of Marie-Anne. I watched the people of the city go about their affairs, innocent, oblivious. No one else needed to suffer. \n\nI decided I would let her kill me, for that is what I sincerely thought, in my naivete, that she desired. I had done what I could to be reasonably assured of my salvation. I was not frightened of death, only of the pain, of what tortures the witch would devise. But I steeled myself and summoned as much courage as I could and waited for the night. Little did I know that for her, death is far too merciful. \n\nAt sunset, I was beyond the tall stone ramparts of the city, prepared to die. The night was fair and mild and I tried to catalogue all of my senses, the way the breeze felt against my cheeks, the faint smell of a cooking fire somewhere nearby, the drone of birds and insects. I knelt in the soft grass. \n\nThe sun had barely sunk beyond the horizon when a churning, thick mass of clouds appeared in the sky, a sickening green.  It was as though a great storm approached, though no rain or wind accompanied the agitated sky. Through the city gates behind me rumbled a magnificent carriage, black with gilt wooden grotesqueries grinning out at me. The spectral horses that pulled it were gaunt and agitated, their eyes glowing red, snouts wreathed in smoke. They reared and struggled against their iron bits.\n\nA finely dressed man exited the vehicle and looked at me with disdain. Despite his powdered wig and face, there was something about his eyes that were too bright, too unnatural. He held out his hand which was grasped by that of a woman in black leather gloves. The witch emerged, her beautiful, wicked face bearing a triumphant expression. \n\n‘Is this he?’ the man said, unimpressed.\n\n‘Come, Philippe, don’t be a snob. This is my dear René. René has been a very naughty, rude boy.’\n\nA sudden, invisible force dragged me by the hair across the grass to her feet. She put a delicately embroidered mule over my throat and began to apply pressure, causing me to gag and gasp.\n\n‘I had so many different plans for you, René. So many creative, imaginative ways for you to enter my service. But then you had to go to your little priest with his magic words and now I can’t do anything at all.  So, you must remember, you forced my hand.’\n\n‘Just kill me!’ I cried, sputtering. ‘My soul is prepared. Just do it.!\n\nBoth of them laughed coldly. She removed her shoe and I gasped. She bent down and lifted my chin in her hand.\n\n‘I am not going to kill you, beautiful boy,’ she whispered, her voice chilling me to the bone. ‘I’m going to give you the fate of which lesser men dream. You are mine. Forever.’\n\n‘If I do this,’ the man asked anxiously. ‘Does that mean we are even?’\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \n\n‘For now.’\n\nBehind her, the man revealed his fangs. She laughed and pushed me towards him and in an instant, he gripped me with preternatural power. I tried to fight him, but it was futile. I was like a rodent in the jaws of a serpent. I felt myself weakened, helpless to stop it, but welcoming the end. *Surely the witch was wrong*, I thought.  *I am going to die.* Then, there was blood in my mouth. Not human blood, but the blood of the undead. I couldn’t resist, it was already down my throat and I wanted more. From that moment, I was as you see me before you.\n\nThe vampire disappeared shortly thereafter. I belonged to her, her servant, lover, and reluctant accomplice. For over a century I traveled with her, witness to all of her depravities. And then, right after the end to your country’s civil war, she tired of me, like she tires with all of her playthings. She released me, or at least that is what she told me. For fifty years, I wandered from place to place, doing carpentry by night, free, happy as I could have been in this form.\n\nIt was then that I met your great-grandparents. But that story I will leave for another night.”\n\nI took a deep breath. René looked down at his hands, drained by the ordeal of recounting the past. \n\n“Thank you,” I said. “I…know that must not have been pleasant.” \n\nHe stood and walked away from me and down to the dock. He stood for awhile looking at the blackness of the river, lost in memories. I had a million questions, but gave him his space, cognizant of how time moved differently for mortals than immortals. \n\nWith a sigh he turned back, facing me. In the distance I caught the image of a shrouded figure, perhaps a woman, draped in black. I was hit by a wave of utter hatred so violent it nearly brought me to my knees. I closed my eyes and when I opened them, it had vanished.\n\n“Did you see that?” I shouted.  \n\n“What?” He was at my side with dizzying speed. When I described to him what I had seen, he shook his head.\n\n“This witch, she’s behind all of this, isn’t she?”  I asked.\n\n“She’s playing with you. Her favorite pastime. But there is much I need to understand if we are thwart her plans. We need to talk to someone who will have more…recent information.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Follow me.”\n\nHe began walking towards the cottages at a supernatural speed. I cursed and ran after him. When I finally caught up, winded and cramped, I found him touching the deep claw marks in the side of my cottage. \n\n“I hope you’re not reassessing your thoughts on structural integrity.”\n\n“No,” he grinned. “I think I know where to find your *loup garou.*”\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "text": "‘Curiosity killed the cat’ One of my late grandfather's many mantras, which he would instill in his numerous, attentive grandchildren. Inevitably, in the decades to come, I led a conservative life, inhabiting a picturesque birch cabin surrounded by a plethora of pine trees in a densely packed coniferous forest.\n\nI seemed to gravitate toward a life of solitude and serenity within the forest's confines, either spending my days roaming the ever-curious forest or remaining in the comfort of my cabin. \n\nFriday 27th March 1998.  My mother had come for her annual weekend visit, which I had been accustomed to for years now. My mother was a woman of liturgy, going to church every Sunday and following her weekly schedule to a tee. \n\n08:45.  Upon my mother's entrance to the cabin on that foggy, chillsome morning, I slouched on the kitchen counter. Tired, I turned on the kettle for Mother’s Coffee. 60 degrees Celsius, 1.5 cubes of sugar, and a dash of milk \n\n09:45.  Scrambled eggs, sunny side up with a black coffee is ingested into my drowsy body. Alcohol and little sleep are a killer combination. Hopefully this wears off before evening comes. \n\n18:45. Night has fallen in the woods. My mother has retreated back to the guest room in which she inhabits during her stay. Despite my mother's \"frequent\" visits, she was oblivious to the forest’s quirks. Will she learn of them this stay? Nothing too suspicious has happened thus far, yet a growing sense of unease has befallen the house, an eerie silence within a loud world. It may come tonight. \n\n22:45.   I can hear it lurking around the forest, its distorted body dragging itself among the frozen leaves. It’s too cold for a spring night.\n\n01:45.  It's tapping at the window. Its monotonous nature expressed in its slow, continuous taps. I’ve never looked outside upon its arrival, yet I knew who it was. \n\nMy mother was so distraught after the disappearance of her first daughter, Amelia. She claimed that she knew the town outcast had stolen her away, yet she was never found. Little does she know, I knew what happened to her. It was quite the task dragging her lifeless corpse to the forest. With a trail of crimson blood accompanying us as I dragged her to the isolated shed on the outskirts of the forest. It was an accident. That's what I tell myself anyway, as she shouldn’t have been rooting around there. I couldn’t just let her live after what she saw. \n\n03:45. As I was sitting, head down, at the kitchen table, my mother came down and out of interest, opened the blinds, which revealed the source of the tapping. She shouldn’t have looked. She would have never been ready for the family reunion that occurred. As my little sister ripped our mothers lifeless body apart like a rag doll, with my sister mouth peculiarly unhinged, ready for its annual meal, I wondered when my father would visit me. We could finally be reunited with our ‘Amelia’.  \n\nAlthough my grandfather was correct, ‘Curiosity did indeed kill the cat along with many other pets’, he failed to understand that Curiosity would also kill my little sister, and in turn, many other lives. This may confuse you all so let me introduce myself. Hello, I’m Curiosity Jones.",

        "text": " It has been two years since my ex, Sophia, and I broke up. I am now in a happy relationship with my current girlfriend, Lily. Things are going great, or so I thought until Sophia's recent behavior made me realize that she is not over me yet.\n\nAt first, her attempts to contact me were harmless, but as time went on, her behavior became more concerning. She started leaving notes on my car and showing up at my workplace.\n\nOne day, I came home to find something was off. The house was too quiet, and there was no sound of Max's barks. It was strange because Max would usually greet me at the door. I searched the house, calling out his name, but there was no response.\n\nAs I walked into the living room, I saw something that made me sick to my stomach. There was blood smeared all over the walls, and the lifeless body of my beloved pet dog, Max, lay on the floor. I knew in my heart that Sophia was responsible for his death.\n\nDays after Max's death, my pet bird Kiwi went missing. I searched for her everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. I could not bear the thought of losing another pet, but I knew deep down that Sophia was responsible for her disappearance.\n\nHer behavior is becoming more erratic, and I am afraid for my life. I feel like she is obsessed with me and is trying to hurt me in any way possible. She is always watching, and I am never truly alone.\n\nOne night, I am home alone, and I hear a noise outside. I look out the window, and I see Sophia standing there, watching me. I feel my heart racing, and I know that I have to do something to protect myself.\n\nI run towards the door to lock it, but I realize that I have left it open. I quickly shut it and look around the room for something to defend myself. The only thing I can find is a kitchen knife, so I grab it and stand near the door, waiting for Sophia to make her move.\n\nI can hear her footsteps getting closer, and I feel like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. Suddenly, the doorknob starts to turn, and I see Sophia's face through the crack in the door.\n\nI scream at her to leave, but she just stares back at me with a crazed look in her eyes. I hear her hand hit the door, and I know that she is trying to force her way in.\n\nI can feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins as I try to push the door closed with all my might. I know that I have to protect myself and Lily at all costs.\n\nFinally, Sophia gives up, and I hear her footsteps retreating from my apartment. I am shaking with fear, and I know that I cannot stay in this apartment any longer.\n\nI never found out what happened to Sophia after that night. I never heard from her again, but I always feel like I am being watched. Every time I see someone who looks like her, my heart races, and I feel a sense of panic.\n\nLily and I are going to have to move to another apartment, but I know I'll still feel uneasy. I have changed the locks and installed a security system, but I still feel like I am not safe. I know that Sophia is still out there somewhere, and I am always on the lookout.",

        "text": "  \n    \n  Buckle Up. This one has it all.  And it´s all true. If anything, it´s watered down. When you talk about the spiritual battle happening in Earth Realm and running into well connected satanic cult mafia families, well, the story is going to be insane even if you get just 10% of the Hell that it is. Still, the lessons learned are worth the scars. One simply couldn´t make the truth up. The truth is simply unbelievable. There´s somethings you just don´t say, but people kind of know.  They just hope it isn´t true even though they know it is. We love to gaslight ourselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  This story is one I want to keep my distance from because the people involved are murderers and their ties cross lines into government, police, organized crime, ritual sacrifice and highly profitable international cartel businesses. On the front, it's all legitimate organizations and but behind some layered veils lays the occult, satanic influences, unreal thrist for power and cult bloodlines. The spiritual other world is very real.  Just talking about parts of it is dangerous... but it is even more dangerous to not talk about it. Remember what we are told ´be wise as serpants and kind as doves´.  In this world, if you are a sheep, that´s what you are. Nobody wants to be a sheep. Because sheep get taken advantage unless, in rare instances, they have a shepherd that truly loves them. You want to be be a wolf this world. As for us wolves, it´s a personal choice whether to be a good wolf or a bad wolf.  I want to remind that wolves are very loyal to their own pack and very loyal to their mate. It's good to be in a wolf pack. \n\n  \n  This is a love story that involves witchcraft, lovespells, lovebombs and ultimately lies, deceit, betrayal, curses, ritual sacrifice and cold blooded murder. I will tell this story from the first person persepective but it did not happen to me. It happened to someone else, someone who listens to the Smoking Owl Tales youtube channel and wants to share the truth for those with ears to listen. In fact, this story is happening again and again. The names and places change, but the story stays the same. You might just recognize this story´s pattern from something you´ve seen in your life  ...your story.  This story is not connected to yours.  Even though it actually is. We're all connected.  This story takes place in two cities primarily, I will refer to these cities as Oz and Emerald City, which obviously are not their names. The part of the story that happens here is mostly in Oz. It's amazing how small the big world is when you start naming events and places. I want to stay 10 feet from this story and the dark forces involved.  So officially, this story is just some fiction that I made up. Your discernment will have an idea if that is fact.  There is truth in fiction and fiction in truth.  With this one, there is wisdom in entertainment or maybe entertainment in truth. That´s enough on that, this experience blew open the door of spirituality in my life. Even though I´ve had certain gifts the entire time. Now I know why I was targeted.  Here´s how it went down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n  I was living in Oz City. I got out of the gang world and had cleaned up my life.  My name is George, but people call me G.  That is definitely NOT my real name. I had gotten involved with some bad stuff.  Bad people. Bad stuff if you know what I mean. I thought about it all and realised where the road I was on lead to. I didn't want to arrive at that place. I managed to get out of the gang world, drug free and had started my own business. I was over two years clean when my business started to take off. I had to hire workers for all the contracts coming in. This is a few years back, 2018.  I don´t want to get into specifics, but I had a few employees and the numbers were good.  We were doing installations on commercial properties. I had achieved the financial success that I thought was impossible.  I made it.  Mostly.  I lacked the love that I wanted.  I thought I´d really be happy if I had a woman in my life to live in this success with.  With Tinder, Hinge, Insta and OnlyFans, dating is crazy now.  Did you know OnlyFans has 3 million ´content creators´ at the start of 2023. Not sure this is a plus for humanity. I wanted to find a woman that had her virture intact, to build something good, something wholesome together.   \n\n  \n  As part of cleaning up my life, I started to be a regular at a local church in Oz City.  The people were friendly and I looked forward to going and being part the community on Sunday mornings.  One time after the service, they offered prayer services. I asked to have a prayer said over me.  An older and kind gentleman put one hands on my shoulder and the other on my heart and prayed and said that like in Psalm 23, I will drink from the good water.  He said that I had a glow, and he could see it.  I felt amazing that morning.  And that is when I notice her looking at me.  She looked away in an awkward moment when I caught her just staring at me.  It was like she was waiting to get her turn to talk to me.  She wasn´t exactly my type, but almost exactly. She had an energy and enthusiasm about her and she just seemed to single me out in that big room with all those people.    \n\n  \n  ´Hi my name is Maria.´ She said.  ´I just love the music they sang here this morning.´ She said.  “Yeah”. I said.  I´m a traditional guy and usually like to start the talking with a girl, but I guess people are just so open and friendly in this setting. There is a level of trust. I mean, the bad girls who go clubbing on weekends and indulging in worship of their ephemeral beauty are probably home asleep with hangovers while this one is bright eyed and fresh for church at 10:30 on a Sunday morning. There´s a cafe as part of the building the church is in.  ´Want to try a chocolate croissant?´ They give them free to new attendees.  ´Is this your first time here?´ I asked.  ´No´ she said. “I try to be here every Sunday.”  Funny, I had been coming here for about 4 months and not seen her once.  “The chocolate croissants won´t be free for us, but let´s grab a couple.” She said.  We did. And they were good.  Maria was amazing.  She was a young beautiful woman who could have any man she chose.  And she just seemed to stare at me with puppy eyes.  She was a musician as I am.  This was a wonderful day.  But something was off.  She didn´t seem to know anyone there except me.  But I wanted to enjoy her company and not be weird or paranoid.    \n\n  \n  We started dating.  I wanted to move slow, but Maria seemed to want to rush things.  I´ve had my streak of crazy relationships, so I like to get to know who I am getting involved with.  My most toxic one would later pale in comparison to what was flowing down the river and into my life.  If I had any idea who Maria was, I would have ran as fast as I could.  For my safety, for my life and for my sanity.  It´s the perfect story, meeting a beautiful and brilliant woman at a church service on a sunny Sunday morning.  Maria claimed to have only dated a couple other men in her life, but she seemed to really know what she was doing when we were together.  I asked her once how she could be so satisfying and know what she was doing in between the sheets. And she wrote it off and said “its not that complicated”.  Now I know that she had targeted me.  Why? Because she could see my glow. When you got the glow, Satan comes or more likely sends his minions to try to derail you.  She saw that glow, which I didn´t understand at the time, but I do now. The glow. You dear listener might just know what I am talking about here. You probably have it too or know what it is. \n\n  \n  This all turned out to be a big wake up call. But before I ever met Maria, I had always been different.  I know now that my family line carries a curse.  Most are aware of it, but we don´t talk about it. It´s one of those things that you hope will go away if you just don´t talk about it long enough. But things go the other direction. Holding back this secret while misunderstanding it just makes it like a volcanic eruption when the top finally blows the lid. The spiritual attack in the form of Maria was the passcode for blowing the lid off this volcano.  I know now that I have the glow.  Some call it chosen.  The being different that cursed me is actually a gift. I am a ´playable character´ in the Earth Realm game. And the gang stalkers, NPCs, trucker hitchhikers are all here to derail my mission. \n\n  \n  I was born during a leap year, and it was strange because, aside from my own mother, two other women in my family had their babies that year.  It´s like they were trying to have babies that year.  I know now, that this was indeed the fact. I don´t want to say the year because that will reveal a personal datapoint about who I am. But it really was a leap year. This has significance.  You see, I can see the spirit world.  Everybody can to a degree, but so many don't understand their own powers.  The dark forces above don´t want the masses to understand their spirtitual power. Keeping the masses in the dark helps maintain control. Some will wake up during their lifetime, others will not.  Some awakened ones pretend they don´t see it.  There are sheep, wolves in sheep´s clothes and then there are those like me, just wolves.  The others in my family can see with their eyes too, but they hate me for my glow. I´ve had several near death experiences in my life.  Looking back, my own family was trying to off me.  But I just wouldn´t die.  Bad stuff happened. But I just kept on keeping on. And glowing. This is why Maria targeted me. She wanted the light for herself. It´s not love, it´s more like stealing. She doesn´t have the light so taking mine is like survival for her. She´s like a dark void that feeds on life energy, a real vampire. She is a witch from a long line of witches and warlocks. They wanted my life energy.  They say the devil wants your soul.  This is so true. But he wants so much more than just your soul. The devil wants your whole bloodline. \n\n  \n  About my Near Death Experiences, I was poisoned as a child.  A television fell on me from above. I was injected with something. None of it worked.  I just wouldn´t die.  I couldn´t see it but somehow none of it worked on me.  There are things that can´t be explained with logic. They always treated me lesser.  My mother left my Dad when I was 10, not sure what that was about. There were demonic spirits all around. I could sense it. Somethings just happened and were not explained.  Things happened that I will just describe as “blasphemy against God” and leave it at that. Growing up, I was surrounded by family members and people who had sold their soul for powers, gifts and wealth.  The theme was spiritual loss for material gain. The deal always sounds good on the surface, but it´s like nobody reads the fine print. In the end, it´s a bad deal. A very very bad deal. Everybody, each and every single one will later regret the bad choice they made. It´s that simple. I'm going to say that one more time... everybody later regrets the very bad choice.    \n\n  \n  Some call it narcissism, others just say demonic and spiritual possession. As a child I would dream of the spririt realm, and it made sense to me. It just did.  I tried to hide the fact that I knew these things. But I was the black sheep. I would be the scapegoat for the others.  I just wanted to belong to something good.  That´s why I got involved in some stuff in my teens.  I wanted to be a part of something. That´s the thing about gangs, it really feels like a good community at first.  The pride and power feels amazing when you´ve never felt that before.  I was surrounded by narcissists. They call some “covert narcissists” because when the masks drops it is just shocking to see how evil they are. Some are good at hiding it.  But like the saying goes, there are three things you cannot hide for long, the moon, the sun and the truth. \n\n  \n  I have a good temperment.  After I cleaned up my life and got focused, success just came steadily to me. Once the distractions were gone, good things just start to happen.  I didn´t want to be like my older brother and cousin.  I wanted to stay out of gang life.  I wanted to have an honest business, pay my taxes and sleep at night knowing nobody has anything on me.  It took some hustle, but it really actually happened.  It's not easy to make a plan and maintain the discipline to make it actually happen. The other path would lead to life in prison or worse. This path will lead to, well it lead to wealth and wholesome independence. This is what I wanted. This was my dream and it came true. Almost. \n\n  \n  When Maria came into my life, it felt like this is it.  God is sending me a good woman to compliment my success.  But as people familiar with toxicity and narcissism and dark arts are too familiar with, things always seem too good to be true in the start. This was the case. It just all seemed to be too good to be true. Maria was so nearly ideal in so many ways and she seemed so attentive and focused on working towards making me happy. I thought maybe God had sent her to me. But this was balanced out with dread. I took it real slow with her. I wanted to be sure.  She was trying really hard. \n\n  \n  Aside from showering me with the physical love that a man naturally loves, Maria used the word 'love' quick.  She said she loved me.  'I love you'.  Beautiful words.  But the ultimate manipulation tool of the narcissist, or a witch or warlock. She used her spells to trap me. She cast her evil spells on me. It is natural for a man to love a beautiful young and virtuous woman who loves him. But in a world where so many women, people, have fallen from grace, when a man finds a such a prized woman he is ready to give such a woman a crown of divinity.  And the woman gives the man his crown of divinity.  We are stronger together united.  This is the way it has to be for it to really work. And this is why such unity is being targeted in our world... to promote disfunciton.  Such a healthy tree will bear sweet fruit. But this woman, Maria, is no woman of virtue. She is an actor, a chamillion.  She is a witch in disguise and none of such witches can keep their mask on forever.  A harlot of Babylon is too good to be true and the so horrible, it is unreal. I had dreams that were prophetic. One really shook me and now it makes so much sense. That is the one of the black mantis perched on a beam of light.  It must have been just a couple months after I met her that I started having this dream.  The mantis represents her, and the light is my soul energy that she is siphoning from me to her for her desperate survival. She casted her lovespells.  Words have power and she wrapped her spiritual tethers around me with her lovebombs and spells that she spoke to me and spoke over me in private outside of my physical presence.\n\n  \n   I wanted to believe the sweet lie, so I tried to make things work. She told me that I'm all she ever wanted but continued to disrespect me. Basically she wanted to condition me to be okay with the abuse. My toxic family was no different, In the realm of witchcraft they have what you call 'familiar spirits'. Dear listener I couldn't tell you how many times Maria would stare at me and I would ask what is wrong? Her reply was 'I can't read you or what you're thinking it's hard'. Anyone who operates in Witchcraft without meeting each other knows they can communicate telepathically. This is why it was not only my old gang friend Crawler but random people we would meet where I suspected &amp; felt like they knew each other.  She is not the only one who has told me that she could not read me. This is the spiritual essence of gang stalking. All she ever had to do was ask, and I would have told her what I am thinking. I'm not big on lying &amp; I don't ever wish bad on people or become jealous for no reason. I like to see people make it in life &amp; succeed. Well these people are the exact opposite. They are literally children of the Devil. He came only to lie, steal, cheat, &amp; destroy. \n\n  \n  My body was sounding the alarm bells, but I stayed.  There was a time where I was laying with her and I got up to go in the other room because I felt literally sick to my stomach.  This effect she had on me would only get worse from here.  It´s like my body and spirit knew I was in danger, but my mind was stuck in some lovespell logic loop and wanted to believe the chamillion illusion I was bearing witness to. There were so many coincidences, or synchronicitites. Her last name was pretty much my name, my real name.  Her birthday was the day after mine.  It like she was put her on Earth for me exactly.  And she was... her assignement being to destroy me.  Little by little, and despite the often strange vibes, I gave her the title.  Girlfriend.  We were going steady. I thought that maybe I was just being paranoid and that she might just be my soulmate.  But things changed after she got the title. It´s like she had been working doubletime to earn the title. Once she got it, once she secured me, she started to change.  She said \\`I was being an ass.\\` She stopped giving compliments.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I was a little uneasy.  At times I started wondering exactly who it is that I have here as a girlfriend.  Her stories just simply did not add up.  I asked her to clear up stories that didn´t add up and she would just double down on her unrealistic and obviously a lie story.  This is calculated gaslighting.  I don´t like admitting it, but I needed to know. I paid for a background check on her.  It was money well spent because I was shocked to find out who it was I had sleeping in my bed with me.  She actually was very wealthy and had considerable assets internationally.  This was shocking for a young woman who presents herself as sweet and inexperienced.  In truth, she was born into a wealthy Satanic Mafia Cult family and she is very very aware of her status.  Such a status comes with pride, but behind that veil is dread.  None of them are happy about their predicament.  Maybe more than the wealth is the status of the forbidden knowledge that gives them their sense of pride and entitlement.  Her act was slick, I have to admit. Without her youth and beauty, she´d be powerless, but she still has this and will for some years from now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Maria was sent to take me out.  I understand this spiritual reality now.  One more thing about the background check that really really threw me off.  Maria was a paid and salaried police informant.  Seriously, you can´t make this stuff up.  Imagine finding out that the supposedly virtuous girl that is telling you she loves you is a spellcasting, salaried by the corrupt authorities, satanic culy mafia family member on assignment to destroy you and suck every last ounce of life energy out of your soul before leaving you for dead.  Yeah, it ain´t a pretty love story this one.  With all their power, you might think they won... but they lost. The whole gruesome affair just made me stronger wiser and my glow even brighter after the period of darkness and awakening. And the truth about them is exposed. This is why they must run an absurd smear campaign, to try to poison the well of truth about them. That is the thing about evil.. it is a parasite.  The lies are cheap and laughable once you know the playbook.  It´s plain as day to see it once you trust your divinity which is your natural god given intuition. \n\n  \n  Things started getting crazy.  It´s half anxiety provoking and half exciting. That is how such a witch hooks you.  It´s the addictive nature and the thrill of the trauma bond.  That Machiavellian vampire manipulation cocktail of enticement and fear.  We kept going to church on Sunday during the first year.  I know that having God in your life doesn´t require church attendence, but I enjoyed the messages, the music and especially the good vibes from the community. Through all that I felt like I was catching myself and my path to personal heaven.  I was happy to have Maria by my side.  One Sunday, she whispered to me during church service ´I´m not wearing any panties.´  I mean I am a man.  And that is hot.  But why would you do that at church.  It left a bitter taste and I knew she was poison, but you know when the poison is sweet, sometimes you just make a bad decision.    \n\n  \n  I noticed things were disappearing from my home. The razor. My toothbrush. Things that I wear where disappearing. She was pocketing my stuff for her dark magic witch rituals. It´s sounds crazy. I know.  But this is the situation.  Some of my friends started acting strange around me.  I knew something was up. Things are going down and people are not telling me. I´m getting spoonfuls of lies from the people closest to me in my life.",

        "text": "My wife is in love with Squishmallows.  \n\nFor those of you who don’t know, they’re basically these pillow/stuffed animal inventions that come in different designs, resembling animals and aliens, plants and mushrooms, with cute faces and little backstories for each one.  They are stuffed and sewn together with a proprietary material that is especially soft and plush.  Some people get really obsessed with them and they have been compared at times to Beanie Babies or other very popular, trendy novelty items.  People resell them at a ridiculous profit, because when someone wants a specific Squishmallow, they’re often willing to pay top dollar for it.    \n\nMy wife Christine has thirty of them stacked on a shelf in our living room, in various designs, shapes, colors, and sizes, but some people have entire rooms devoted to the stuffed creations.  The designs are pretty cute and I’m happy she has a hobby.  I buy her a new Squishmallow sometimes when I’m at the store.  They sell them pretty much everywhere now, but they used to be more difficult to find.  \n\nWhen I tried to figure out what Christine wanted for her birthday, I got the impression she wanted one particular Squishmallow.  She hinted at it, not outright asking.\n\nFinding a specific Squishmallow isn’t always easy, since some are more rare than others.  Apparently the most uncommon ones sell for as high as two thousand dollars.  Luckily she didn’t want one of those.  \n\nThe one she wanted looked like a big black spider with a weird smile, so I began looking online for it.  None of the stores nearby had it, of course, that would have been too easy.  But eventually I found a seller on EBay and purchased it, requesting the express shipping so the Squishmallow spider would arrive before her birthday.  They had a few other ones that looked pretty unique too, so I bought them as well.  They were all a little creepy-looking, but that was okay, since Christine loves horror and creepy shit, just like I do.  \n\nTime went by and eventually the package arrived.  I didn’t unbox the stuffed animals, instead just wrapping up the brown cardboard box they’d come in.  \n\nWhen her birthday came around, I showed Christine the big wrapped box and a huge smile stretched across her face.  The present was massive, covered in Squishmallow wrapping paper.  \n\nI watched as she unwrapped it, practically vibrating with excitement.  She gasped when she saw the size of the one on top.  \n\n“You got the twenty-four inch one!  Where did you find it!?”\n\n“A magician never reveals his secrets.  Is that the one you wanted?”\n\nShe took it out and inspected it more closely, and I saw her expression drop.  The smile disappeared.  \n\n“What?  What is it?  Is that not the right one?”\n\nChristine began to turn the stuffed animal around.  I could tell she was disappointed, but I didn’t understand why.  She’d never been a great gift-receiver, and never showed a big reaction, but I thought this time I’d really nailed it.  I thought she’d be ecstatic.  \n\n“Uhh, it’s great,” was all she said at first.  But I could tell she was disappointed.  \n\n“What?  What is it?”\n\n“This sucks to say, I know you probably worked hard on this.  But it’s fake,” she said, standing up and carrying the large stuffed animal over to me with an annoying, know-it-all smile.  \n\n“I saw someone talking about these online.  There's no tag, and see this little marking?  I'm sorry.  It’s a knock-off.  It’s cute, though.  I still like it!” \n\nI could tell she didn’t.  \n\nTaking it out of her hands, I examined it closely.  I hadn't thought about the details much at the time of purchase, but she was right.  Usually the toys came with a little tag telling their story.  And it looked a bit strange, too.  Not cute like the regular ones.  This one was creepy-looking, with a sharp, jagged-toothed smile.\n\n“Can you check the other ones?” I asked, feeling a little sick to my stomach.  “I bought you a few more.”\n\n“Oh no…  How much did you pay for all these?” she asked.  \n\n“Not much,” I lied.  \n\nShe took them all out of the box and started examining them.  A creepy skeleton, a green ghost, a witch, and a black owl with glowing white eyes stared up at her.  The longer I looked at them the more obvious it became that they weren’t right.  Their proportions were all wrong, their faces malevolent and mean.  They were actually disturbing-looking.  There was loose stitching and a few stains here and there on them.  One of the stains was brownish-red, like old, dried blood. \n\n“They’re…  Great…  Thank you,” my wife stuttered awkwardly.  “I like them.  Really.  I’ll put them up there with the others.  On the shelf.”\n\n“You don’t have to do that.  I can contact the seller on EBay.  I’ll get a refund.  I’ll get you the real ones.”\n\n“No, no, it’s fine,” my wife insisted, putting them with the rest of her collection.  “They’re kinda… quirky.  It’s alright.  Don’t worry about it.”\n\nShe kissed me on the cheek, smiling weakly.\n\n“I love them.  Really.”\n\n*\n\nWeeks passed and nothing much really happened with the Squishmallows.  They sat there on the shelf gathering dust and my wife didn’t take them down to play with them or even look at them.  It was further proof to me that she didn’t like them as much as the others, and I couldn’t blame her.  \n\nIt wasn’t just that they were knock-offs.  They were downright disturbing.  I noticed she was tucking them further and further towards the back, hiding them behind the others.  I was quietly glad for that, since they creeped me out, and every time I walked by the shelf they caught my eye.  The big black spider was particularly unsettling for some reason, and its dull, vacant glass eyes always felt like they were watching me.  Its spindly arms always seemed to be waving at me slightly in the breeze.\n\nOne night when I was up late watching TV, I saw something moving on the ceiling in the hallway.  Those black, glassy eyes reflecting back at me, catching a hint of glow from the television screen.  Whatever it was blended with the shadows and crawled away, disappearing into the darkness.  I couldn't make out the details, but I got the impression of a huge black spider, its body a bloated, sagging orb as large as a beach ball.  \n\nMy heart beating fast, I turned on all the lights, searching the apartment for whatever I thought I saw.   After finding no trace of it, I redoubled my efforts, feeling like I couldn't be safe again until I found whatever that thing was.  I eventually went to the shelf and looked at the spider I'd purchased for Christine.  I stared at it for a long, long time.  Its smile looked like it had grown even wider than before.  It looked very pleased with itself.\n\nI decided I would contact the seller, regardless of what Christine said, and ask for a refund.  More than anything, I just wanted those THINGS out of my house.\n\nAfter typing out a message, I hit send.  \n\nI waited for days but there was no reply.  There was no indication the message had even been seen.\n\n\nThe return address on the package indicated that the seller lived in the city at least, and I decided to drive to the house to knock on the door.  \n\nI was tired of people taking advantage of me.  Tired of strangers online who thought they could get away with robbing and cheating innocent people.  In case you hadn’t guessed already - this was not the first time I’d been swindled by an online bargain.  There was that whole Instagram fiasco.  And don’t even get me started on the laptop I bought from Wish.com   \n\nThe house was on the other end of town, across the river.  A bridge separated the west side of Hollow’s End from the rest of town, and I usually avoided going over there, since I’d had a few bad experiences on that side of the city.   But this time I figured I'd make an exception.\n\nWhen I pulled up outside the house I saw it was dark inside, except for a flickering light in one room - probably the living room judging by its location near the front of the house, with a big picture window overlooking the front lawn.  \n\nI went up to the front door and knocked, carrying the huge box full of knockoff Squishmallows in my arms.  Their weight seemed to shift and change, as if they were alive inside the sealed box, and I imagined a knife or a sharp claw suddenly slicing through the packing tape at the top, and the Squishmallow spider and all of its friends clambering out and attacking me.  \n\nBut of course that didn't happen.  This was real life, not Chucky 7: Revenge of the Satanic Squishmallows.  \n\nStill, no one was answering the door.  And the flashing lights coming through the window in sporadic bursts reminded me in an unsettling way of Poltergeist - or some other horror movie whose name I had forgotten. \n\nI knocked again, louder this time.  \n\nNo answer.\n\nSomeone was definitely home, though.  The flashing lights and noise from inside told me as much.  \n\nI leaned the box against the door for a second, just to give myself a break since it was so awkward, when I noticed the door was swinging open by itself.  \n\nWhether it was just poorly latched or whether someone had opened it, I wasn't sure.  But I couldn't see anyone inside.  All I could see was darkness.  And I thought I heard someone speaking from up ahead, in another room.\n\nThinking they might be telling me to come inside, I pushed the door open further and took a tentative step through the entryway, my heart hammering fast.  \n\n\"Hello?\" I called out.  \"Is anybody there?\"\n\nThe voice continued speaking from up ahead, getting faster now, more emotional.  It was a man, and he sounded desperate.  It sounded like he was pleading for his life. \n\nTaking slow steps forward, I walked deeper into the dark house.  \n\nI didn't even notice when the door quietly clicked shut behind me, and locked itself.\n\n*\n\nAs I got closer to the room with the glowing, flashing lights I'd seen from outside, I realized it was the same room where I heard the voice speaking.  It sounded even more desperate now.\n\n\"Please.  I'll do anything.  I'm sorry.\"\n\nA whispering voice spoke back to him, sounding like it was talking in another language.  \n\nIt sounded angry.  Demanding.\n\nThe box in my hands suddenly began to rattle and shake violently, and it sounded like something was stabbing the cardboard box from inside.  Something sharp cut my palm and I dropped the box, crying out in pain.  \n\nMy rational mind was telling me that was a staple, and that the box wasn't moving by itself, there was simply something inside that had tipped off balance.  \n\nStuffed animals DON'T come to life.  That DOESN'T HAPPEN.  Whatever this is, it isn’t happening.\n\n\"Who's there!?\" The voice shouted. \n\nWith no choice now except to come clean, I announced my presence.\n\n\"Hey, sorry, I didn't mean to sneak in.  Your door was open and I heard voices in here.  I bought some Squishmallows from you online, and…\"\n\nEverything happened all at once after that.  \n\nI went through the doorway and as I did I saw the portal in the center of the living room, glowing blue and flashing.  It was swirling and pulsating with light, hidden behind clouds that were being blown around violently in a vortex. \n\nI took a step backward when something crawled out of the portal on all fours.  It looked horrifying and wrong.  It was bleeding and appeared injured - its alien face twisted in a mask of rage and pain.  It’s difficult to explain what it looked like exactly - because it didn’t resemble anything from this world.  \n\nThe closest comparison would be a hairless hyena cross-bred with a goblin.  \n\nAs it scrambled out from the portal it shook the blood from its haunches like a dog coming in from the rain, splattering the walls and ceiling of the room with gore.  \n\nA voice in the shadows spoke in that same strange language and the creature began to change.  \n\nIt was a shapeshifter, I realized.  And it was taking on the form of things it could see in the living room.  \n\nFor the first time, I noticed the Squishmallows.  With all the chaos happening and in the flickering darkness of the room I hadn’t seen them at first, but now that I noticed them they were impossible to ignore.  The Squishmallows were everywhere.  The walls were covered with them.  Shelves had been installed going from floor to ceiling on every wall in the room, and they were filled with the trendy stuffed toys.  Ranging in bright yellows, oranges, and reds - to black Halloween-themed ones like those I had in my box.  The only difference was, these were real.  They weren’t knockoffs.  \n\nAll of the Squishmallows were splattered with blood, though.  Completely ruined now.  Copious layers of dried blood could be seen in various places throughout the room, coating everything. \n\n“You shouldn’t have come here…” the man said, and I realized he was injured.  He was clutching his face as red liquid seeped out from between his fingers.  \n\nIt looked like he was trying to hold his face on.  \n\n“YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE COME HERE!!!!” he shrieked at the top of his lungs.  “LEAVE!  RUN!  BEFORE THEY TAKE YOUR FUCKING BODY!”\n\nI spun around, my heart beating so hard it was threatening to burst from my chest, and saw the box which I’d been holding was now bursting open.  The massive black spider crawled out first, climbing out of the box and making its way straight at me.  \n\nIt raced across the floor like a wolf spider, clambering up my leg and releasing a fine spool of webbing behind it.  The thing made its way around my legs in circles, attempting to tie me up while I screamed and kicked, thrashing and batting at it with my fists.  \n\nMore of those hairless goblin-hyena creatures were crawling out of the portal, looking like they were straight out of a Dark Souls game.  Bloodied and howling in agony, they pulled themselves through the gateway and shook themselves off, just as the previous one had done.  \n\nHowever they were getting here, only one or two were able to come through at a time - and at great cost to themselves. \n\nThe alien voice spoke again from the shadows and this time the creatures coming from the portal didn’t change shape right away.  Instead, they came at me.  Crawling at first, attempting to rise to their feet but unable to, they made their way faster and faster towards me.  \n\n“You need to run..” the man said weakly, his face a bloodied ruin.  He took his hands away and the skin fell away to the floor like a Halloween mask.  Blood poured out and ran down his neck, soaking his white shirt.  \n\nHe grabbed the spider Squishmallow from my pants and tore it free from me, while it hissed and tried to bite him.  I saw it puncture the skin with several quick attacks, and he dropped it to the floor.  The massive spider skittered away, disappearing into the shadows.  \n\nHis hand rapidly swelling with unknown poisons, the man began attempting to free me from the spider web I was wrapped up in.  His flesh ballooned and yellow pus began to seep out from the sores as he struggled to remain conscious.  \n\nFinally, I was free.  \n\nI didn’t dare turn around to look and see how close those things from the portal were.  I could hear them and knew they were close enough to almost reach out and grab me.  One of their bloody fingers brushed against my leg as I just evaded its grasp, bolting for the exit.  \n\nWhen I reached the door, it was locked.  \n\nA key was required to open it, which I didn’t have, and I knew I was fucked.  \n\nExcept for that picture window in the living room.  That was my only shot.  Right back into the lion’s den.  \n\nThe bloodied, crawling, goblin-hyena things were just at my heels, and my heart skipped a beat when I saw them coming at me.  I was cornered, in the entryway of the house with nowhere to go.  \n\nAnd once again the man came to my rescue.  \n\nHis face a blood-soaked mask of muscle tissue, he screamed as he lifted a chair from the living room and hurled it through the air, where it landed with a heavy crash on top of one of the creatures.  The other one was stunned momentarily, just long enough for me to leap over it and race back into the living room.  \n\nI ran through the darkness and heard the gasp of the man who had saved me when he saw what I was about to do.  \n\n“NO!” he shouted.  \n\nBut it was too late.  \n\nI leapt through the huge picture window and it shattered against the top of my skull - the pain of the impact far worse than anything I could have imagined.  Broken glass rained down all around me as I landed on the glass in a heap, clutching my bloodied scalp.  \n\nScrambling to my feet I began to run, too terrified to look back.  \n\nThe screams of outrage coming from the house were surprising, and confusing to say the least.  I didn’t understand why the guy who had saved my life was so mad all of a sudden.  \n\nIt wasn’t until I got home and looked in my email again, this time taking a moment to look in the “spam” folder, that I realized the man HAD actually gotten back to me.  The day I sent my email, he’d replied almost immediately.  \n \n*My sincere apologies for the mix-up.  Those toys were not meant to be sent out, and I would be more than happy to replace them with the correct toys.  Please send them back to me IMMEDIATELY.  I am concerned that they may be hazardous… Due to the materials they were made with.  I need to keep them contained.  I need to keep them here.  I’ll sell all of my collection to survive, if I have to, but they CANNOT know that there is a world outside of this house.  I MUST CONTAIN THEM.  YOU MUST SEND THEM BACK TO ME NOW.  BE VERY CAREFUL UNTIL YOU DO.  DO NOT TRUST THEM.  DO NOT BE IN DARKNESS WITH TeHM THEY LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THE DARKNESS THATS THATS WHERE THATS WHWERE THEY THRIVE WHERE THEYRE FROM BE AFRAID BE AFRAI BDEDEDDDD BE BE BE BE BEBEBEBE*\n\n\nShuddering, I closed the email.  I didn’t delete it, worried I might need it one day.  For what purpose I didn’t know.  \n\nBut one thing was for sure.  \n\nThe man who sold me those knock-off Squishmallows had the situation contained.  The shapeshifters, the living toys, he had figured out a way to convince them that was all that existed on this side of the portal.  He convinced them his house was our entire world.  And then I shattered his window.  \n\nAnd let those THINGS out into the [world.](https://youtu.be/rHcK2TpBeG4)  \n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/zpi8zt/master_story_list_updated_regularly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

        "text": "Is anyone else terrified of black holes?\n\nThere's nothing else that terrifies me more than black holes. Nothing. Not asteroids. Not gamma ray bursts. Not Cthulu. Not even your mom.\n\nBlack holes.\n\nThis has been a persistent pants shitting fear I've had ever since I was a small child.\n\nI've always been a space nerd. I read a lot of Wikipedia as a kid.\n\nWhen I finally discovered black holes I could barely even look at them. But the morbid curiosity prompted me to read more.\n\nI found out...\n\nThese are the most powerful things in the universe. They are like... Fuck ups in the space time continuum. Objects so dense they bend spacetime in on itself. The gravity is so strong it crushes anything into it, even light. Which is why they're black.\n\nImagine being in close proximity to one. Imagine the pure unfiltered terror. \n\nIt's just a void. There's nothing in it. When you finally get sucked into it, it's just infinite blackness and crushing gravity. There will be no ground for you to land on, nothing to see. And the worst part is, you'll never escape it.\n\nIf it's a small one, you'll be spaghettified long before you ever get that close. You'd be dead.\n\nBut a supermassive black hole will not spaghettifi you. Assuming you're in a space ship or some kind of suit to keep you breathing, you would remain in tact and fully conscious during your descent into the supermassive black hole. You would experience falling into literal nothing with no escape. You'd see the entire universe bending and warping behind you.\n\nBeing next to hyper massive objects speeds up time significantly. Even the Earth does it a bit.\n\nTime dilation next to a black hole would mean that by the time you actually get crushed by the singularity, the universe may have already experienced heat death. That's how insane this is.\n\nWhat's even scarier than just falling into a black hole on your own is having one swing by and slowly devour your entire planet with you on it. Imagine being present when this happens. Seeing the black mass in the sky as your planet is ripped apart. Imagine seeing the sun ripped to pieces.\n\nYeah. This is terrifying. I'm not sure if it's the blackness, or the infinite nothingness, or the inescapable destructive power. But this is the scariest thing in the universe.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I knew all this. \n\nAnd I told myself: \"Well we're way too far away from any of these to ever experience one.\"\n\nAnd that's half true.\n\nBut what I didn't know was...\n\nSome black holes move. Like, Ricky bobby fast. They sonic the hedgehog through the universe at near light speed sometimes.\n\nThis is the worst. The worst thought.\n\nAt any moment, we could get very unlucky.  A rogue traveling black hole could swing by our solar system at any time. We would never see it coming. They're black holes. Scientists can only see the effects they have on surroundings, not the actual holes themselves.\n\nIt would just happen. Without warning.\n\nAt best, the solar system would be scrambled. Planets thrown all about. Sun possibly destroyed.\n\nAt worst, you get to see your entire planet devoured with you on it.\n\nThis is the worst possible apocalypse we could have. I can't even imagine it. \n\nOh yeah, and I'm sure you've heard a lot of people talk about a supposed Planet X. They say there's evidence of a very large planet or object in the outer reaches of our solar system throwing shit around and causing a gravitational mess. Scientists have been trying to find it for many years, but they can't seem to.\n\nIt just recently came out that they think it's a black hole out there. That's why they can't see it.\n\nYeah. This might be a lot closer than we think it is. I've metaphorically shit my pants over this several times.\n\nOverall, I just can't fathom this shit. I can't get over it. It's a fear I've never been able to shake.\n\nIn No Man's Sky you are encouraged to fly into black holes because they teleport you closer to your goal in game. But I just CANNOT do it. Whenever I run into one on accident I shudder and look away from my screen. Sometimes I'll even load a save so I don't have to look at the fucking thing.\n\nIf I do have to fly into one, I take my headphones off and look away from my TV.\n\nWhenever I see a black hole picture or video I also just can't look at it. I can't do it.\n\nIt's real bad. It's so bad.\n\nI know the world will end, but pray to whatever you believe in that it's not this way. \n\nI just wanted to see if anyone else shared my batshit crazy phobia.\n\nHave fun sleeping tonight. Once you know you can never unknow.",

        "text": "I knew “Secret Catcher” back when he was just Adrian Blackwater, a pimple-faced nerd who sat next to me in Freshman English. Our seats were assigned by the professor, and I don’t think I would have chosen him as my seat mate otherwise. He had, what my Mom calls, “darty eyes”, the kind of gaze that never quite connects with yours. He would also draw stick figures fucking during the lectures.\n\nAfter college and everything that happened, I tried to ignore his newfound success, but I was seeing it everywhere. As his YouTube channel blew up, he got brand deals, TV appearances, an interview on *60-minutes*. But, I didn’t tell people I knew him. If I did, I’d have to share *everything* I knew about him, which I didn’t want to do. It was embarrassing, and frightening, and if I spoke it out loud I worried he might come back and finish what he started.\n\nThe premise of his channel was simple—he’d go up to crowds and ask people their biggest secret. It started as people admitting to drunk hookups, but then he made his way to political rallies and different alternative communities. His videos that did the best normally involved mentally-ill conservatives, religious fanatics, or poor people. Someone would say something crazy, which would then get edited with drastic zooms and goofy music. People loved it, which made sense. Society has always loved to mock the sick and the poor, and his videos were no different.\n\nAfter college, I moved to California, hoping my incident would stay on the coast where it occurred. But, as his channel grew in popularity, I couldn’t run from it. My roommate, who looked like the caricature of “Los Angeles Twenty-Something”, loved his content and, on multiple occasions, told me how hot she thought he was. But, as much as she tried to sell me on his desirability, I couldn’t shake the image of him standing outside my house.\n\n“You’ll change your mind one day,” she would say. \n\nThen, last night, things *did* change. I heard her scream from her bedroom. A minute later, she ran into my room, her phone screen pushed into my face.\n\n“Did you see?” She asked.\n\nI took her phone and looked at it. The article was from *The New York Times*. Adrian’s picture, which was him at a protest with a microphone in his hand, was right below the title: *Four Women Come Forward with Allegations Against Radical Journalist “Secret Catcher”*.\n\nMy hand went numb as I scrolled through the text. I couldn’t even read it—I just stared at the screen for what felt like the appropriate amount of time.\n\n“Wow,” I finally said, handing her back the phone.\n\n“I’m devastated,” she said.\n\nI nodded, hoping my quiet would make her leave. But, she sat on my bed, tears welling in her eyes.\n\n“It’s just… I don’t know. He was doing such incredible journalism, going to the kind of places CNN and MSNBC would never go. Why can’t we just get one person who doesn’t suck?”\n\nI shook my head. As she spoke, I tried to ignore to numbness as it made its way up my arm and shoulders. It felt like he was touching me again.\n\n“It’s getting late,” I said.\n\n“I invited over some people, if that’s okay,” she said, flipping a strand of dyed pink hair behind her ear, “We’re going to have a little memorial. You know the girls from my improv class right?”\n\nI nodded. When they got together, they liked to scream and pretend box one another.\n\n“We always send each other his videos,” she said. “We’re all just so devastated. I thought burning his picture while we rewatch some of our favorite videos of his might make us feel better.”\n\nI nodded again, studying the numbness as it walked down my back. I closed my eyes, which was a bad idea. When I did, I saw him again. I remember the pebble hitting my window. As I got out of bed to see what the noise was, I saw him in my front yard, stumbling back and forth. He waved to me. It took me a second to even recognize him—we hadn’t exchanged a single word since that Freshman lecture hall two years before. I opened the window and yelled down to him.\n\n“Are you lost?” I asked.\n\n“Not anymore,” he called back, his words slurring. Then, he walked toward the front door.\n\nI thought I locked the door. I always locked the door, didn’t I? But, then I heard someone walking up the stairs. My housemates had all gone home for the weekend. There was only one person it could have been.\n\nI ran to lock my bedroom door, but it was too late. The doorknob turned and the door swung open, pushing me back. I looked up at his silhouette in the doorway, his posture slouched and breathing heavy.\n\n“I’gawd a secret,” he mumbled, pointing at me. “I have a crush on YOU!”\n\nHe walked toward me. I wanted to scream, but it was a college town; people were screaming up and down the street all night. He yanked off his shirt, revealing a flabby stomach and droopy chest. He had a couple of small, ironic tattoos—a beer can with a “Mom” banner over it, Santa riding in a convertible, two cats kissing. He, like so many men at my liberal arts college, were the kind of guys where nothing was supposed to mean what it really meant, where reality could be bent to their liking. He reached for my face, pulling me toward his with hot, sweaty hands.\n\n“Hey,” my roommate barked, snapping her fingers in my face. “I asked if it’s cool if my friends come over?”\n\nI nodded again.\n\n“Yeah. I just—“\n\n“We talked about being better at communication,” she said. “We split this rent 50/50. I shouldn’t even have to ask to invite my friends over, but it’s a courtesy to you. Maybe I won’t even ask anymore, I don’t know.”\n\nWith that, she stood up and left, slamming my door behind her.\n\nI stared at my closed door for a moment, remembering how safe I used to feel behind one. \n\nI spent the night scrolling through the comments on his Instagram apology, which was a screenshot from the notes app. He begged his supporters to believe the victims, saying that we should always believe women. He said his actions were a result of toxic masculinity, which was followed by a story about his father beating his mother. He said everyone could use a lesson in consent, and he hoped his supporters would learn from “this situation”. At the bottom of the apology, he directed his followers to a link for a GoFundMe for his victims. He put up another post a few minutes later, stating that his next video series would be him sitting down face-to-face with his victims, taking “accountability” to the next level.\n\nI don’t know what I expected from the comments underneath it. Maybe I was hoping there would be no comments at all, that Adrian’s voice would finally fall on deaf ears. But, instead, I read things like “this just ruined my weekend” and “can’t we have just one good guy?”. The more I read, the sicker I felt, which was only made worse by the screams and laughs of my roommate and her friends. Not long after, our fire alarm went off. I guess they burned his picture. They all cheered.\n\nI imagined his face, twisting and blackened by the approaching fire, smoke rising off his charred skin. Like everything else, I thought it would make me feel better, but it didn’t. I also thought about taking my story to Instagram, of adding fuel to the fire. But, I knew that wouldn’t help. The jury had clearly decided.\n\nI remember back in high school before Adrian broke me, I was with my Dad in a Grand Canyon thrift shop. There was a whole section of the store dedicated to Bigfoot. I asked him why so many people loved him—wasn’t he supposed to be a monster? Dad put his arm around me and whispered in my ear. \n\n“People say they hate monsters, but that’s a lie. Everyone loves a monster. That’s why we want to film them,” he said. “Humans are dazzled by [dangerous things.](https://www.dandeluise.com/)”",

It’s level of sentience is confusing, but I need someone else to know this, in case it comes after me. \n\nMy name is Walter Van Dale. I’ve been a part of reddit for a little bit, not too long. I mostly use it just to find out how to do something, like embroider or such. I like writing. I don’t like reading other peoples writings quite as much, but I like writing. Some months ago, I wrote a horror story. You can scroll down on my profile and find it. It was a funny little Lovecraftian-wannabe cosmic horror. I liked writing it, liked even more the reception it had. But I swear, it did something to me. \n\nYou know the placebo effect? You believe something good will happen from an action, and that makes it have a positive effect, even if the action or product itself doesn’t really do anything, but your mind believes it does, and so it reacts accordingly? I feel like I’ve been going through something similar, but this time it’s the entire world doing it. \n\nI currently live in a northern part of Europe, but I’m originally from the South. I’m not too used to cold and early darkness. I was a bit scared it’d have a really bad effect on my mental health, since I’m not used to it. But since I came here it has never been a degree Celsius below 8, and the days got longer. I thought maybe it was luck, maybe I moved here at the right time to start getting Spring. But it got weirder. \n\nI live pretty far from where I study. It isn’t too far, all things considered, but I need to ride a bike for about an hour to get to my university, and another hour to go back home. It’s a nice ride, except for one specific part of the ride, where I need to go through a really busy car road. In the South, riding past it would be a death wish, but here it’s a normal thing to do. But you can’t kill years of instinct out of me in days, so I keep waiting till the road is completely free as far as I can see before I pass. I need to wait a good while, and kept complaining to myself as I went home of how I hated it. And the next day, for absolutely no valid reason, a part of the road got damaged to the point where any car circulation was strictly forbidden. It has been for almost two weeks now. No one understands how, it’s as if there had been a small earthquake here, but it seems unreasonable. Nothing was felt, we’re not on a tectonic rift and the roads here are pretty sturdy. I don’t complain about it, but it did feel too much like a coincidence. I thought maybe it was like karmic retribution, I talked shit and now I got to feel guilty that I made so many peoples life worse and more difficult. I’m not religious, so I didn’t dwell on it too much. \n\nBut yesterday something else happened. I’ve been seeing a girl here. We’re not serious, but I guess there has been some form of emotional connection attaching us to each other. A mix of genuinely enjoying each others presence, and the fact that we’re both lonely and far from home. But we had a fight yesterday. It was something dumb, I jokingly mocked one of her favourite Disney characters, and didn’t realise how much it meant to her. In hindsight, I remember reading about how the brain has a hard time separating fiction from reality when it comes to emotions. Maybe to her, this character had a real emotional significance. I don’t know, I was too defensive of myself and didn’t think of it. I went back home, and kept thinking about how much the entire situation was dumb.  By the time I was home, I had felt a bit more relaxed from the ride, and was seeing how this may have come through. I sent her a message apologising, saying I didn’t understand her point, but wanted to. And she didn’t see it. I thought maybe she archived my chat, needed some time to also think. And I was okay with that. Mostly. I couldn’t help but remember the road. I kept asking myself if I muttered something under my breath as I rode back. I hoped not. \n\nNext day I go to her place. And my heart sinks when I see the police cars. I go there, ask what happens. They ask me the same, they had seen her texts. Her phone was there. Her wallet too. They saw our texts, and concluded her disappearance had nothing to do with me, but they’d keep me inform if anything came up. \n\nI was a mess. You never expect this to happen to the people you know and get along with. And even if I tried rationalising it, I felt like it was all on me. I did this. I muttered. I had to go on a walk. I was on autopilot mode at this point, and couldn’t even think of my surroundings. I only realised where I was when I got to the road. My instincts told me to wait till a car had passed. But there were no cars. The road was broken. I had walked all the way here on my own. And I looked to the sky, the sky that probably should already be dark, but instead was only now setting. And I saw it. Remember the story I told you about? The one I wrote? In it I had a giant creature, Cthulhu like. I saw it. It was faded, as if made of clouds. But it was there. I could feel its eye on me, I could feel it reaching out, just like I wrote about it. As if a cold hand was trying to squeeze my brain for the knowledge it wanted to give. I could see its chest move, as if breathing. And then I saw the ground beneath me do the same. So slow. So imperceptible. And then the trees did too. The rocks. The houses. The canals. Everything. \n\nIt looked at me, and I looked back. I couldn’t ignore it, I was like a deer in front of headlights. And then it talked. Just like I wrote, it talked in a language I never heard, and yet I know it deep within me. The language of stardust and void. The language with which the Universe had been made. And with each word I could understand, with each thought dedicated to it, I could feel my body relax. My mind being split in two, one part being me, another being whatever it was trying to make out of me. This other part smiled and started walking to a bus station. It rode the bus home, it was relaxed, it wasn’t me, and yet it very much was. It answered to my mothers text, it talked to my classmates, it messaged my best friend, the one who I had shown my other story for opinion, and none of them knew it wasn’t me. He talked like me, joked like me, complained like me. But I could feel its thoughts, and it has none. All it wants is to spread awareness. To let others know that it's there. That this monster, this entity, is around. Because once you see it, it can take you. It’s using the little of me that is left to write this. It can control how I’m writing this text, how I’m leaving the explanation to the end. Because now you know it could be there. And you’ll notice it. We all do sooner or later. \n\nRun. Don’t fight it. Don’t believe in it. Don’t even assume I’m lying or that it is dead the moment it took me. That which is dead can never truly die. And if you see Ana, tell her I’m sorry. I would have loved to have fallen in love with her.",

        "text": "More than a year ago, my sister disappeared. Today, the police officially told our family they are closing the case as they didn't find any evidence of foul play. It’s clear that whatever happened to her happened on our last call. So today I’m sharing that frightening last call’s transcript, hoping someone will help me find some rational explanation of the reasons of her disappearance.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Transcript of the last call from Roman \\[REDACTED\\] to Tanya \\[REDACTED\\]. 17th of November 2021.*  \n*Translated from Romanian to English.*  \nRoman: Tanya!  \nTanya: Rom! How are you?  \nR: I’m good! Drowning in work for my thesis… and feeling a bit nostalgic.  \nT: Where are you?  \nR: *\\[After short hesitation\\]* I’m home.  \nT: …You’re in London?  \n\n\n*\\[Sound of clearing throat\\]*\n\nR: Yes of course… Where else would I be? Is everything alright?\n\n*\\[Heavy breathing\\]*\n\nT: Y-yes… I’m just tired.\n\nR: What’s up? Tell me some news, come on… You never tell me anything about what’s happening down there!  \nT: *\\[Chuckle\\]* I’m good, not much news. You know our little town…\n\nR: How’s mom?  \nT: She’s ok, she’s going out with Gabriel every day now. He seems fine, you know…\n\nR: Oh, he does? I thought he was a douchebag just two weeks ago!\n\n*\\[Laughter on both ends\\]* \n\nT: He is ok, and I’m happy for mom. She’s not drinking as much, you know… And she looks happier than when you left. \n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nR: I will be back for Christmas, I promise.\n\nT: It’s ok… We got used to living without you. I mean… Don’t take it wrong! Of course we want you here, but… It’s just what you gotta do. Finish your studies… We need a doctor down here. Mr. \\[Redacted\\] is getting old… And he’s always been a creep!\n\n*\\[Giggling\\]*\n\nT: You know, actually something did happen.\n\nR: What? Something happened in little Nucet? Wow! Tell me more…\n\nT: Now you sound like an arse… It’s actually not funny. It’s… Quite puzzling.\n\nR: I’m listening.\n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nT: It’s the weirdest thing and… You know, if I wasn’t sure you knew more than what you let on, I’d be a bit scared. It’s really creepy Rom, even for your disgusting standards.\n\nR: You know I’ve no idea what you are talking about, right?  \nT: Where are you, Rom?  \nR: I told you, I’m home.  \nT: You are in London?  \n*\\[Silent, shuffling sound\\]*\n\nR: *\\[In a seemingly frustrated tone of voice\\]* Yes I am, that’s where I live! What got into you? Just tell me what happened already!  \nT: I received a note.  \nR: Ok, from whom?  \nT: Well, that’s what I don’t know, but it’s… It’s the weirdest thing really. Remember Baita?  \nR: If I remember Baita, the mine? The uranium volcano our town has been sitting on for 70 years? Yes, I think I do remember that! Quite difficult to miss the millions of tons of Uranium at a couple of kilometers from our house!  \nT: I know you know Baita, idiot. I’m just asking you if you remember when we went there… To the pit.  \nR: *\\[Hesitation, deep breath\\]* I went there at least a dozen times.\n\nT: You know what I’m talking about. We went together, once.  \nR: Yes. Of course, I remember that…  \nT: It was 2002, I think. I was 8. You wanted to play next to the excavators, in the evening.   \nR: I remember that…\n\n*\\[Silence on both ends\\]*  \nR: I’m sorry. I-I don’t know what happened that night.  \nT: You were just trying to scare me, as usual.  \nR: I wasn’t. I really… Something startled me. I didn’t mean for it to… I-I got scared.  \nT: And I was already scared because of the damned bridge you wanted to walk on. So your timing was definitely well-thought… But you were 12, you didn’t want to hurt me. We were kids.  \nR: I didn’t mean to scare you Tanya, really. I-I got scared.  \nT: The point is *\\[Deep sigh\\]*... You asked me not to tell mom I broke my ankle when I fell.  \nR: We would both get in trouble… It wouldn’t matter how it-  \nT: And I never told a soul!  \nR: What’s the point Tanya?  \nT: Well, I broke my ankle because of you. You are the reason we were on the bridge, you are the one who startled me off of it.  \nR: I know, I’m sorry.  \nT: And yet I never told a soul… Even if you never told me why the hell you screamed.\n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nT: And then, after all of that, after the big deal you made about whatever reason made you scream, after you begged me not to tell mom. After all of that, you went out and just told who, Rom? Who did you tell?  \nR: I didn’t tell anyone.  \nT: Well one of us did, because….\n\n*\\[Sound of shuffling paper\\]*\n\nT: Either you did, or someone YOU told is fucking with us. *\\[Reading from the paper:\\]* I’ve been with you since Baita. I’m with you every night.  \nR: What the f– What is this?!  \nT: That’s the note I got. Someone who knows what happened that night, who knows I fell from the bridge, who knows I could have easily died and… Who says he’s been \\[Deep breath\\] with me ever since. Whatever that means… If you didn’t tell anyone, if you are not the one who’s “with” me, then who the hell knows?   \nR: I don’t… It sounds like someone is trying to scare you.  \nT: Yeah, you think uh? Someone who knows we were at Baita.  \nR: Maybe they don’t know, it’s a fair guess! Many children where going to bike there on summer!  \nT: Maybe they did guess, yeah. But it’s not the only thing…\n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nT: You’ve always made a point of startling me, especially after that night… Like it wasn’t enough I covered for you with mom… Like it wasn’t enough dad was just gone… Like our lives were doing great!\n\n*\\[Light sobbing\\]*\n\nR: It was just a game… It’s just what brothers do.  \nT: Jumping out of a corner is what brothers do… The other shit… That’s sick stuff. That was never just a game. It was fucking creepy Rom. Is that what you mean, “every night”?  \nR: What are you talking about?  \nT: The staring game, Rom!  \nR: The what now?  \nT: Your creepy staring game… The face pushed against my bedroom window… Your eerie face smiling at me… Not even. *\\[Deep sigh\\] ...*Not even blinking. That’s fucking creepy Rom. And I don’t know how y-  \nR: What are you talking about?  \nT: *\\[Sobbing\\]* Rom!   \nR: What’s going on Tanya?\n\n*\\[Sobbing slows down. Silence for a few seconds\\]*\n\nT: Where are you?  \nR: Are you kidding me?\n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nT: I saw you, Rom. I saw your stupid smile against the window, again. Just 10 minutes before you called me.  \nR: Agai– What are you talking about, Tanya? Are you crazy? I’ve never done that!  \nT: Sure, you never tried to scare me as children, you didn’t stare at me unblinkingly from the corridor and from the window… and you MOST certainly didn’t send the note to scare me! Fuck you, brother!  \nR: But I didn’t!  \nT: You didn’t what?  \nR: I never… I don’t fucking know how not to blink. You’re creeping me out, stop it!  \nT: Oh, I’m creeping you out?  \nR: Yes!  \nT: What about you? Where are you RIGHT NOW?  \nR: Ok, I’m done with this stupid question, check your WhatsApp.\n\n*\\[Sound of fingers typing on the display\\]*\n\nT: Is this…?  \nR: That’s my location. Live. How would I have been at your window 10 minutes ago? I’m in fucking London, in my house. Now would you please calm down?\n\n*\\[Heavy breathing\\]*\n\nT: I must be stressed. \n\n*\\[Sigh\\]*\n\nR: You are not stressed, you are not delusional, and I am sorry. I thought I saw something… That night on the bridge. I… It was stupid. I scared myself, I screamed. When… When you fell down the bridge, my heart sunk. Tanya… I never meant for you to get hurt. Now… The note, that stupid note you got. That’s something different… I didn’t… I…  \nT: If you didn’t tell anyone, then how do you explain it?  \nR: Maybe you did tell mom, you forgot and now…  \nT:...And now what, Mom is pulling me a prank?   \nR: Maybe… Look, I don’t know. Maybe someone saw us and now is trying a sick prank.\n\n*\\[Silence follows for over 30 seconds\\]*\n\nT: Roman… I need to know. This, all these things are odd.   \nR: I know. I’m just thinking… Maybe I should come over in the weekend.  \nT: No. That’s not… Rom, I need to know I’m not crazy. I need you to admit you’ve done that…  \nR: Done what? The note?  \nT: The staring, Rom… I’ve startled at least a dozen times at your face peeking through the window in the last 10 years or more…  \nR: I’m in Lon-  \nT: Not now! Not now, Rom. I might have hallucinated because of the note, I got scared. I’m calm now. I’m asking you calmly please, Rom, to admit to me right now you’ve done the unblinking stare from the window… Not now, not today Rom. Not now, but in all these years we’ve lived together.  \nR: Tanya, I… Who were you seeing at the window?  \nT: I saw you! Your face. You, smiling at me with your creepy look. Your fucking eyes with that not-blinking thing you do! Even Maria saw you once!  \nR: I never did th- Tanya… Please leave the house. There’s something… There’s something I need to tell-  \nT: Roman, Stop! Stop! Stop! STOOOOOP\n\n*\\[Roman raises voice above Tanya\\]*\n\nR: I NEVER… I never did that. I never stared at you… Where’s mom? You need to leave now Tanya you-  \nT: STOOOOOP  \nR: Tanya! Tanya, where is mom?\n\n*\\[Shuffling sound, sound of door banging close\\]*\n\nR: TANYA! Answer to me!  \nT: *\\[In a calmer voice\\]* Stopitstopitstopitstopitstopitstopit.  \nR: Tanya… Tanya! I’m calling mom. You can’t be alone there, I don’t know what got into you.  \nT: The bridge… The mine… Your screams, the peeking. You always wanted me dead, uh? You did? I always thought you wanted to scare me b–\n\n*\\[Loud bang, sound of crashing window\\]*\n\nR: Tanya?\n\n*\\[Heavy panting\\]*\n\nR: Tanya?\n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nT: *\\[In whispering voice, sobbing\\]* Why are you doing this to me… Why? I never told anyone, I love you… Why?  \nR: Tanya, what was that? Are you ok? Why are you whispering?  \nT: Leave me alone! Leave me alone!  \nR: I’m n- Tanya?  \nT: Leave!  \nR: What’s happening, what was that sound?  \nT: Leave me alone Rom, I don’t like it, leave me alone, leave me al–\n\n*\\[Another bang, followed by silence\\]*\n\nR: Tanya? What’s happening?\n\n*\\[Silence\\]*\n\nT: *\\[Whispering\\]* It’s here.  \nR: What? Tanya? Who is here? What’s happening?  \nT: It’s here… It’s… You. Y-you are… Why are you doing this to me?  \nR: Where are you?  \nT: I’m… I’m under the bed, it’s… It’s in the entrance. It’s just standing there. It’s… It’s smiling.   \nR: Tanya, I’m calling the police. You are not safe! Don’t move!  \nT: I can hear the steps. Please Rom whatever you’re doing please stop it…  \nR: Tan-\n\n*\\[Loud bang, followed by a loud scream. Then silence\\]*\n\nR: Tanya!\n\n*\\[After a few seconds, a heavy breathing approaches and eventually stops over the phone, then the call interrupts.\\]*\n\n*\\[End of the transcript. Call duration: 13:03:41.\\]*  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI tried to call several times after, but she didn’t answer anymore.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I called the police, while I tried processing what had happened. The police got to the place and found a broken window in Tanya’s bedroom. The window had been crashed from the inside. Other than that, there was no sign of any struggle, nor of any breaking and entering from the entrance door. Whoever got in, if anyone at all, had the keys or was let in. \n\nI’ve been held as the main suspect in the case of Tanya’s vanishing for 48 hours in London, where I resided for studies at the time. Once it was proven I had called from my student residence in London and I had not left the country for the previous 10 months, I was dismissed.\n\nGabriel and my mother were also held as primary suspects involved in the disappearance. But they were both seen at the restaurant that night, and at least 5 different witnesses confirmed they were there while my sister and I were on the call.  \nAfter months of silence, today the police closed the case without any plausible explanation of what happened on the night of the 17th of November, 2021. \n\nThe only unofficial version they provided us with is they believe my sister called me to cover up her decision of vanishing. She crashed the window, made up some story of someone getting into the house, banged a few doors, and then just left.\n\nOnly she didn’t take any of her belongings, she had no money, and she hasn’t made contact ever since with anyone. Not with mom, not with her best friends, not with me.\n\nShe didn’t show any signs of depression or any sign she was planning to leave. \n\nI found out later that on the 20th of November 2021, her best friend released a statement. In that statement, she claimed she had seen me peeking through the window one night they were having a sleepover in Tanya’s bedroom. My face pushed against the window, no blinking.\n\nThe date of my alleged peeking was the 10th of October 2021. The day I gave my last exam at the university. In London.\n\nThey dismissed that and the phone call as some kind of subtle psychological game my sister played on all of us.\n\nMy mother believes this version, so does her friend. \n\nI don’t. I know my little sister wasn’t lying. \n\nI know it because of that night on the bridge at the Baita mine. Because of something I have never wanted to face.\n\nBecause I can’t stop thinking of what I saw that night at the pit, before I scared Tanya off the bridge. I can’t stop thinking of the note, of whoever was peeking, and of my sister begging me to leave her alone while on the phone.\n\nI believe her, because I can’t stop thinking of what I saw that night on the bridge.\n\nI believe her, because that night on the bridge I saw a boy standing, smiling in an eerie and horrifying way. \n\nSmiling like he wanted to hurt us.\n\nI believe her because that boy, the boy standing on the other end of the bridge, looked exactly like me.\n\n[And that’s why I screamed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lost_Whispers/)",

        "text": "  \n\nI never thought that finding a mobile phone would lead me down such a terrifying path. It was a cold and dreary day when I stumbled upon the device, lying in the alleyway behind my apartment building. I picked it up, thinking I could turn it into the authorities or at least try to find the owner. But when I turned it on, I realized that this was no ordinary phone.\n\nThere were no icons or apps on the screen, just a black background and a strange symbol in the center. It looked like some ancient symbol, one that I had never seen before. When I tried to turn the phone off, it wouldn't respond. I tried to take out the battery, but there was no way to open the back of the phone.\n\nThat's when the weird things started to happen. At first, it was just small things, like my TV turning on by itself or my fridge opening and closing on its own. I chalked it up to my imagination and tried to ignore it. But then, the really strange things began.\n\nLate at night, I would hear whispers coming from the phone. At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but the voices grew louder and more insistent. They were speaking in a language that I didn't understand, but their tone was unmistakable. They sounded angry, almost demonic.\n\nI tried to get rid of the phone, but it wouldn't leave my possession. Whenever I tried to throw it away or leave it somewhere, it would always end up back in my pocket. It was like the phone was attached to me like it was a part of me now.\n\nThe worst night was when I woke up to find a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was tall and thin, with long arms and legs that seemed to bend in unnatural ways. Its face was obscured by shadows, but I could feel its malevolent gaze upon me. I tried to scream, but my voice was caught in my throat. The figure reached out a long, bony finger and touched the phone in my pocket. That's when I passed out.\n\nWhen I woke up, the phone was gone. I searched everywhere for it, but it was nowhere to be found. That's when I started to feel a strange sensation in my head. It was like something was trying to push its way into my mind, like an invasive thought or memory. I tried to resist, but the pressure was too much. I felt myself losing control, losing myself.\n\nThat's when I saw the figure again, standing in the corner of my room. It was holding the phone, and its eyes glowed with a sickly green light. It spoke to me in that same demonic language, and I knew that it was trying to possess me. I tried to fight back, to push it away, but it was too strong.\n\nI don't know how long I was under its control, but when I finally came to, I was lying in the alleyway where I had found the phone. It was lying beside me, still glowing with that sickly green light. I knew that I had to get rid of it, to destroy it before it could harm anyone else.\n\nI tried to crush it under my foot, but it wouldn't break. I tried to throw it against the wall, but it bounced back like a rubber ball. It was like the phone was indestructible, imbued with some kind of dark magic.\n\nThat's when I knew that there was only one thing left to do. I picked up the phone and threw it as hard as I could into the nearby dumpster. \n\nI heard it clatter against the metal sides of the dumpster, and then there was silence. For a moment, I thought that was it. I thought that I had finally rid myself of the cursed phone and everything would go back to normal. But then, I heard a strange noise coming from the dumpster. It was like something was crawling around inside, something that wasn't quite human.\n\nI hesitated, unsure of what to do next. Should I leave it there and hope that no one else would find it? Or should I try to destroy it once and for all? In the end, my curiosity got the better of me. I cautiously opened the lid of the dumpster and peered inside.\n\nAt first, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Just a pile of garbage and debris, and then something moved. It was quick, almost too quick for me to see. But I caught a glimpse of a thin, bony arm reaching out to grab the phone. The figure pulled the phone back into the shadows of the dumpster, and then everything went silent once again.\n\nI knew then that I had made a grave mistake. I had unleashed something dark and sinister upon the world, something that I couldn't control. I tried to walk away, to forget about the phone and everything that had happened. But it was too late. The figure was following me, watching me, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nFor days, I lived in fear. Every time I turned a corner or heard a strange noise, I knew that it was there. Watching me. Waiting. And then, one night, it finally caught up with me.\n\nI was walking home from work, trying to ignore the feeling of unease that had been gnawing at me all day. I was almost home when I heard a noise behind me. I turned around, but there was no one there. Just an empty street and the sound of my own footsteps.\n\nThat's when I felt something cold and hard press against the back of my neck. I froze, unsure of what to do. And then, I heard its voice. It spoke in that same demonic language, a language that I could almost understand now. It told me that I was its puppet and that I had no choice but to obey.\n\nI tried to fight back, to resist its hold over me. But it was too strong. It had complete control over my mind and my body. I was its plaything, its pawn in a game of darkness and terror.\n\nFor years, I lived in its shadow, always on the run, always hiding from the light. I knew that I could never escape it, that it would always be there, waiting for me. And then, one day, it finally caught up with me. It pulled me into the darkness, into a place where there was no light, no hope, no escape.\n\nI don't know how long I was there, lost in the darkness. But then, I saw the light. It was small, almost imperceptible at first. But it grew, slowly and steadily, until it was a beacon of hope in the midst of the darkness.\n\nI followed the light, knowing that it was my only chance at salvation. It led me out of the darkness, back into the world of the living. And when I emerged, I knew that I had been changed forever.\n\nI was told that I had been in a car accident.\n\nI was in a coma for six months.\n\nBut now I'm awake\n\nThe phone was gone, but its legacy lived on. I was haunted by its memory, by the memories of all those who had fallen under its spell. But I also knew that I had a duty, a responsibility to warn others of its dangers. To keep them safe from the darkness that lurked within its circuits and wires.\n\nAnd so, I tell my story, hoping that it will serve as a warning.",

        "text": "First of all, I will say that I come from Kazakhstan, so do not be surprised by some differences with Western culture.\n\n\"October 17, 2021, Tuesday. The time is 7:44. I really want to sleep, I was painting all night, as a result, I got 3 light art that were so second-rate and miserable that they couldn't even be saved. Where can I use them? Why do I need them? Why did I decide to give up normal rest? The answer is one: \"Vovan\".\n\nSince today is Tuesday, the first lesson should be homeroom. Why don't I sleep on it? There's nothing important there anyway. While it was not too cold to wear a shift, just a warm jacket is enough so that the cold wind does not freeze your hands. \n\nI went into the classroom, hung up my dark sweatshirt with a white pattern, like those that were popular in the nineties, And headed to my seat. The first desk, the first row, the first option, is almost an ideal place, since teachers do not often check it.\n\nThe children of the senior classes communicated with each other as usual, someone got together in small detachments and stormed the dining room, someone was preparing for lessons. But still, most preferred to sit quietly and look at the phone screen, occasionally addressing their peers. And I sat in my seat and tried not to fall asleep. It turned out so-so, I'll be honest. At the moment when my head touched my left shoulder under the weight of fatigue, a familiar voice called out to me.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" said Artyom. \n\nThe kid is a year older than me, he always spoke directly. Very smart and strong, twice as heavy as me. The glasses perfectly complemented his image, combined with an obese physique, fit well into his appearance. I wasn't angry at his speech, because I knew he was worried about my condition. His precocious deep voice inspired calmness, but occasionally inspired only fear.\n\n\"Not really,\" I managed to say in a dead tone. – Couldn't sleep again.\n\n- \"Are you a moron? Why the fuck didn't you sleep again?\"– There was a slight spark of anger in his voice. \n\n- \"What have you got here again?\" – jumped up again \none comrade. \n\nSergey is also very smart. One and a half times heavier than me, his athletic physique allowed him to strike with a force of about one hundred kilograms per square centimeter. But he's weaker in the legs. Also older than me, almost a year. He is also an artist, he draws definitely better than me, but he lags far behind in quantity.\n\n- \"Everyone is smart, I'm the only one stupid.\" – I thought.\n\n- \"This moron didn't sleep again.\" – Artem stammered. \n\n- \"Is that it again? How do you do it at all?\"\n\n- \"Somehow.\" – I answered sharply. – \"Somehow, but I don't know how.\"\n\n8:01 – call. Everyone took their seats. For the first five minutes I listened to the tedious speech of the class teacher, as always on one topic – teenage maximalism. A topic that will be relevant for a long time. \n\nMy eyelids became heavier, my hands seemed to have folded themselves into a comfortable position for sleeping. I resisted, so as not to be impressed by the hard and cold desk. First one time, then the second, on the third I could not resist severe fatigue. I fell asleep. The dream was strong and sweet. \n\nI dreamed that I was walking with my friends, very old friends, walking, talking about the eternal, about life, it was so cool. Bright colors, meaningful dialogues, the dream itself was very realistic, almost indistinguishable from reality. Only one thing was strange – a hum. A deep, loud and intense hum. I didn't attach any importance to him.\n\nHappiness did not last long. As usual, as soon as I go to bed, someone will definitely disturb me, regardless of the situation, anywhere. \n\nThis time, the heat disturbed my sleep. It was very hot and stuffy in the classroom, just like if you don't open the window in the room for a week. This has already caused me some suspicions, because the apocalypse will not come in 5 minutes, although figs knows.\n\nI woke up with a sudden movement. All sweaty and red, I raised my head, everyone was out. It looked like a prank or a joke, but combined with the infernal heat, it was hardly a joke. I got up, looked around, all 32 people were asleep. They weren't covered in sweat, they weren't red from the heat, no, they didn't care. I was already scared, I thought they were all dead, but when I put my finger to the nose of my neighbor at the desk, I felt the air bend around my finger. \n\n  \"They're alive,\" I thought.\n\nI walked around the classroom, looked at everyone, looked around the office, desks, chairs. Nothing has changed, only condensation has appeared on the windows due to the difference in air temperatures outside and in the classroom. It took about 10 minutes. \n\nNot finding anything interesting, I left the office, and finally feeling the fresh air leaned against the wall, digesting the information received. After 5 minutes, I remembered about the phone, I carefully took it out of my pocket, opened the cover of the case and turned on the device. The time was 17:56. \n\n- \"How much?!\" – almost a scream escaped from his mouth.\n\nI slept for 9 and a half hours. I stood in a stupor for quite a long time. But remembering the backpack that was left in the classroom, I went in search of it.\n\nI returned it without much difficulty, and throwing one strap over my shoulder, went to the exit, simultaneously looking into the rest of the classes. Everyone was asleep. Everything, without exception. Even in the dining room, which I naturally took advantage of, replenishing food and water supplies. The time is 17:57, I'm already walking to the gate that led to the exit from the school grounds. \n\n- \"Well, how am I going to justify myself to my parents?\" – I mentally asked myself the question. – \"What argument can I counter? Why was everyone asleep? What happened at all? How can I influence this?\"\n\n- \"Will I get in trouble for this?\" – with this question, I sat down on a bench standing alone in the middle of the yard.\n\nOpening the backpack, I remembered the loot from the dining room. Two mini pizzas and a half-liter bottle of mint-flavored water.\n\nFor this whole set, I would have to pay at least 600 tenge, but I remember how in the second grade a sausage in the test cost only 70 tenge, I remember a lot of things happened that year. Now I am in the ninth grade, I have not decided on my specialty. \n\nThe street was empty and quiet, as if all the people had disappeared somewhere. \nThere was no noise of cars from the side of the road, no rattling of dishes or people's voices came out of the open windows. It was quiet, so quiet that I could have fallen asleep on the spot, but I didn't want to sleep. Having dealt with the first pizza, I remembered my jacket, it's still hanging in the classroom.\n \n- \"Damn...\" - I hissed. They'll have to come back.\n\n   I got up from the bench, threw the last pizza and water into my backpack, and headed to class. On the way to the building, I noticed that there were not even pigeons. Okay, cats, they don't come here often, but pigeons have always been here. Strange. Very strange. \nWhen I entered the institution, I heard footsteps, the trampling of twenty, no thirty people! They were coming here, straight to me. I didn't run, I hoped for the best. \n\nSuddenly I felt someone's hand on my left shoulder. I started in surprise. \n\nThe hand was heavy and big, only one palm covered my shoulder completely, judging by the soft skin, we can say that it was a child about my age, also a ninth grader or even older. \n\nWith a sharp movement of my head, I turned around, it was the largest student in the class, bigger and heavier than all the students I knew.\n\nI already wanted to ask the question: \"Oh, how is the condition?\" as I immediately felt a sharp pain. Sparks flew from my eyes, scarlet blood gushed from my nose. He hit me, and not just hit me, but with a swing. \n\nOut of surprise, I fell to the floor, hitting the back of my head. I lay there shaking with shock and pain. \nFear brought me back to reality, I tried to run away, but my legs wouldn't obey me, they just convulsed. Before I could recover from the first blow, I saw his silhouette flying not me! He weighs under a hundredweight, I'm only 41, what the hell?! \n\nI felt a sharp, unbearable pain in the abdomen and ribs, I heard a crunch. Blood spurted from my mouth. I began to lose consciousness, slowly I began to stop feeling my legs, then my arms. Then another blow, with a run-up right under the rib, the pain abruptly went through my body, but I didn't have the strength to scream.\n\nIt was clear that it was someone else, because the silhouette of the heavyweight had not gone anywhere. Having finally lost consciousness, I still felt my limbs go numb, then my body, finishing blows were inflicted.",

        "text": "An evening passed like the wind. Another passes faster than the last, more and more nights get wasted like they're currencies being exchanged on the daily. But even still, a dollar bill gets changed, reused till it expires in a matter of dust but a cycle of 24 hours doesn't last, its matter doesn't change or  recycle It just passes. When you don't pay attention to your existence, your own matter and being,  gets recycled. Or more accurately, it withers. We die of old age when we forget our own lives and or others forget our whole purpose. Some say we die when we are forgotten, but what about the soul, where does it get recycled to? Some point to religion and say it goes to a another dimension entirely, but items for our realm never do that. They don't suddenly disappear, except. Time. Time is the only form of matter that is fully temporary, and yet time is what makes matter get recycled. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen our bodies die, our soul passes with time. Days ago I knew what it looks like to have your soul disconnect from your body and wander time. A pattern screamer. A pattern screamer is what lurks when a soul is forced to continue without any tangible form of matter to cling to. Pattern screamers exist, well, try to exist in the holes of our reality, lapses of cognition of our own existence. For when I was forced to lay my mind around the knowledge of pattern screamers, I was withering my own time. I was withered my soul by procrastinated on my work, my reason for existence, and caused something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA soul was likely wandering about, looking for a desperate place to pander into. And it saw a decay of time in front of it. The soul of course took the opportunity when the feeling of existence or lack thereof came to its senses. It came into our reality because of a anomaly in my nature. To be lazy would go against every idea of surviving yet it exists. Laziness wastes time, our soul, and  pushes needs away. This anomaly of function in our realm came upon the soul, wrapping around it. Our reality warped around the confines of a soul without matter and threw up nothing. At least it should have been. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA thing doesn't need a physically being of matter to consist of matter, it just needs to be remembered. And when the soul was warped into our reality, it defied all reality and created a sound. A scream in my kitchen. The sound of a scream emanated a source of fear in me. The want to gain cognition of this occurrence, it formed the soul further. It was a soul until I had thought of it. Now it was a pattern screamer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I could feel a wind inside my home. Shivers running course through my body made the wind worse. The soul was forming. It was desperate. It Tried so hard to keep my full attention. But I was scared, scared that this disturbance in our reality was occurring to me. Like an animal I was scared, I tried to block the sounds and sight of wind pushing papers around its nonexistent presence away for primal fear. A child closes their eyes and ears when faced by something beyond its understanding. They fear the thought of the predator of unknown origin would turn over them and ignore the prey it set its eyes upon. A child fears so much that the gaze of a unknown predator would disappear if they didn't pay cognition to it, and they would be right. Not because a predator would ignore a fearful child, but because the thought of pain closing in the child's mind would be worse than the actual pain of claws wrapping around their precious body and death occurring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe child wants the predator to be forgotten. I want the anomaly to be forgotten. But alas, it doesn't work. For when I opened my eyes and ears I could feel a presence, a sixth sense came to me about an entity near me. I didn't hear it, smell it, touch it, see it, taste it. I just felt it, not as one would feel a drop of temperature, but how one would feel luck going against them when betting. And most of the time. Most of the time, they would be correct. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit was still there but I tried my best to ignore it. Even though it was still existing inside my head within in  the form of a thought, it was not powerful enough to create any form of matter, for fear is one of the most powerful forms of thought. We linger on a presence that created fear in us, making it exist for as long as we wither. We spread the knowledge of a danger to others, resonating with them. They too linger on the presence of a danger and add the cognition of danger to their library of entities to fear. There I sat, withering until my mind forgot, but in the back of my mind I knew. I knew that the pattern screamer would exist forever. That is why this digital writing is displayed on whatever device you are reading this on. The knowledge of this entity, and the occurrence of it will cause reality to falter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore souls will be freed. Why I'm doing this is not something I can occur. For it is not me who is writing. It's the pattern screamers",

        "text": "My dad was a good man, and took a lot of pride in teaching me his 'life lessons' from a young age. \"Listen here, Carl\", he spoke assuredly. \"There are no winners in war, only the losers and the dead\". I never quite understood what he meant by that, as he had always had some kind of fascination with sharing inspiring war quotes with me. For obvious reasons, this one stuck out, as I had only been 13 at the time. I'd seen my fair share of violence and learned plenty about all the wars over the years, but I always felt like It had been too soon. At least then, I still had my innocence.\n\nOver following years, he would regale me with tales of his father, and his father's father and so on. Going into disturbingly great detail as to how they lived their lives, what historic periods and events they may or may not have been a part of. One such tale stood out to me though.\n\nThe story of my great grandfather during World War 2, and how he had fought the Germans to retake Berlin from Nazi control. He went on to explain how he fared in each battle he had fought, however towards the end of his retelling, he started to visibly shake. I almost didn't notice it at first.\n\n\"Son...\", my dad went on. \"What I'm about to tell you next, I have every bit of confidence you will not believe me, but I assure you it is 100% true\". \n\nThis took me aback. The start of his story had been very normal, generic wartime stuff. Running into battle, firing off round after round and ducking into cover wherever necessary. I'd never seen my dad get so shaken by his retelling of what he explained to me next.\n\n\"My father told me this, as I am now about to tell you\", my dad muttered. \"Swear to me you will not tell another living soul of this story\". I nodded and agreed, haphazardly. I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nI won't bore you with all the details, but in summary, he'd essentially explained to me how my great grandfather had entered a derelict, abandoned home in Berlin, as the allied forces were retaking it. This part I'd been told a dozen times. He went on to say my great grandad had found a secret compartment beneath the home, that led to a den containing... zombies.\n\nI'm writing this here because as my father had predicted, I did not believe him. I mean really, zombies? I knew all about them but finding them in some random den in the middle of a war-torn city was an absurd concept. Sure enough, I nodded and smiled as though I could empathize with what he told me, and left it at that. \n\nI won't bore you with too much more of my family drama. I only felt it necessary adding this to the record so you could see where I was coming from. I had no idea whether my father had become senile in his old age, or if he was telling a real story. I guess I know now.\n\nSeveral years later, now in my adulthood, my father had passed away from a brain tumor. It was a complete shock to me and everyone else. He had never told anyone he had it, or if he experienced any symptoms. One day he was here and the next just, gone. I went to the reading of his will with a few other family members and met my father's lawyer.\n\nThe man looked to be extremely sickly. He wore a suit and tie, and spoke in a cordial manner like any other lawyer would, but he was completely pale-faced and looked like he'd keel over next. I sat down before him and prepared myself for the reading. My father wasn't a very rich or materialistic man, so I didn't expect much of anything.\n\n\"Mr \\[REDACTED\\] has asked that I read out his will on his behalf, in light of his passing\", the lawyer spoke firmly. \"All assets and funds are to be divvied up amongst all the family, with Carl being the exception\". I tilted my head slightly, not really upset or angry, just perplexed that he'd leave me out of the will on purpose.\n\n\"Carl will instead receive an especially marked box containing the possessions carried on by the men of the family, in line with their tradition in passing it down generation through generation\". I could tell the lawyer was uncomfortable reading this part of the will, and didn't blame him. My father and his fathers were all ingratiated with some inherent misogyny. An interpretation I made based on the way they all grew up.\n\nAfter all the paperwork had been completed and family started to disperse, the lawyer pulled me aside and handed me a key, looking as nervously as he did when I entered the room. \"This key unlocks a safety deposit box at the \\[REDACTED\\] bank on the corner of 5th and gold\", he stuttered. \"That's where you'll find the lockbox. But between you and me, don't open it\". \n\nThis took me by surprise. Was the lawyer connected to this in some way? I don't recall my dad ever having shared stories with any of his co-workers or friends. Why this guy?\n\n\"Your father told me a story about this box I found hard to believe\", the lawyer went on. \"So outside working hours, I took it upon myself to see the contents. I wish I hadn't\". The lawyer, in a complete 180-degree twist, snapped back to his normal demeanor, thanked me for coming and left in a haste.\n\nAs I exited the building and made my way to the bank, the fears in the back of my mind were mounting. I couldn't make heads or tails of why my father, this lawyer or any of my grandfathers were so terrified of what they saw or heard about. I'll admit it shook me to my core, and I wanted to just forget about all of it. Toss the key into the ocean or something. But that feeling... that nagging feeling kept me going. Kept me inquisitive.\n\nSparing all the details, I got hold of the box and brought it home with me. Opening it I was startled to find what appeared to be a very roughly covered, war-torn diary containing only a few pages. And a fully loaded revolver. What caught me by surprise so much was the distinct appearance of dried blood on the cover of the diary.\n\nPushing all my fears aside I opened the diary, interested in finding out what was so terrifying about all of it. Needless to say that now, I really wish I hadn't.\n\nDAY 3 - 2:23PM\n\nThe boys and I just came back from \\[REDACTED\\]. Holy hell it is a goddamn warzone over there. Heard from Colonel Riolls that the krauts are pushing back into the Ardennes Forest. Don't know how well that'll work for them. Hoo fuckin' rah\n\nDAY 19 -  5:45AM\n\nShit, shit the krauts are attacking. They're fuckin' everywhere. I'm gonna get my ass chewed out by the cap if he catches me writing in this journal, but fuck it all. I need to leave a record for my wife if I go down. I can't let her think I died a coward.\n\nDAY 139\n\nBeen a while since I've written in this shit. Lost 2 good men a few days ago, felt like getting it off my chest. We're pushing into Berlin now. I swear on my granpappy I'll cut the head off that nazi snake. I love you, Mary-Anne.\n\nDAY 141\n\nWe did it, we won the battle for Berlin. Halle-fuckin'-lujah! It wouldn't have been possible without my sarge. That crazy bastard threw a live grenade that fell on top of me clean into the air. Im damn surprised he didn't get his arms blown off.\n\nDAY 156\n\nSomething weird happened today. We were clearing out buildings here in Berlin lookin for some krauts that may be in hiding. Found one building with a neat little trapdoor in the corner. Thought for sure I was gonna get a medal for smoking out whoever was hiding in there. I saw something else though, not a kraut... a goddamn man, ordinary civilian, with half his jaw missing, stumbling towards me. Damn near pissed myself before running out of that damn place.\n\nDAY 158\n\nGot a hold of Sarge and told him to help me clear that weird ass building I found. I don't know how exactly to word this, but we went in there and ...nothing. Damn shambler was fuckin' missing all of a sudden. Who the hell knows where he ended up. Almost got roasted over a fire for wasting his time. Still though, I know what I saw. \n\nDAY 159\n\nSarge and rest of the company is telling us to clear out, get ready to pack up and move back home to the states. The thought of seeing my Mary-Anne again has got me in a real good mood, but I still can't shake the feeling of there being something else in that fuckin' basement. I'm not a believer in them ghosts and whatnot, but there's gotta be an explanation for this. I'm gonna go back in tonight and see what I find.\n\nDAY 160 - 1:37AM\n\nJesus fucking christ above what the hell was that. I need to calm myself down. I need to make this a clear record. I went back in just a few minutes ago and saw not 1 but 5 of those goddamn mutilated monsters down there. I'd run to get sarge but I ain't gonna let them disappear on me again. I'm going back in with my revolver. If I don't make it, if someone finds this, tell Mary-Anne how much I love her.\n\nDAY 160 - 2:30 - 3:30AM ???\n\nfuCk... one of those godamn monsters bit me i Think. gotta make it home... can't die like this.\n\n\\------------\n\nThe diary ended there. What remained were torn up pages in the front and loose pages in the back, hanging on by a thread. What a strange story my great granddad wrote up. Then again, my dad, his dad and so on have affirmed that he never returned from the war. He'd been declared missing by his senior officers and pronounced dead a few months later by the family.\n\nStrange and coincidental as it may seem, maybe he had just gotten hurt somehow and died in a place no one could find him. It's certainly a lot more believable than a zombie outbreak. But then again, the whole concept of a Zombie was never really brought up until George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' back in 1968. So why would my father lie? Why would my great grandfather lie? It's simply too much to come to grips with. I...  I think I have to see it for myself.\n\nA couple months later I took vacation off work and travelled to Germany. Told my family I was going for vacation, so they didn't think anything of it. My first few days were nothing too eventful. Checking into my hotel, relaxing at the pool. Then the diary started to nag at me again, I just had to know for sure.\n\nI began the very, very long and arduous process of looking for buildings that were renovated or built upon the foundations of older derelict buildings back from World War 2. This may sound impossible, but my grandfather left a lot of context clues in his diary about locations, sights. I won't lie, despite what information I had to go on, it was incredibly difficult. But eventually I had found it. Perhaps at the time I felt lucky. Maybe even curious. Now I really can't stress enough, this was the worst mistake of my life, and I fear even all of humanty.\n\nIt was at the sight of the \\[REDACTED\\] building in the central square of \\[REDACTED\\] that I found my mark. Naturally it had looked nothing like the buiding my granddad had described in his diary, but this was to be expected. I walked inside and looked around. At the time it had only been occupied by a few people. I hadn't seen staff or anyone else nearby me, so I did a bit of snooping.\n\nEventually I had come to the sight of a service hatch, in the middle of a storage room. I wasn't sure if this would lead anywhere. At the time I had thought it was a dead end that'd lead into sewers or something. Instead to my chagrin, upon entering the hatch, I found what looked like an old basement. It didn't seem to fit the description of the basement my granddad found, but I pressed onwards anyway. Looking for any connections I could find.\n\nI didn't find anything visually, at first, but as I stepped back towards the ladder in defeat, I heard it. Moans coming from the walls in the back corner. I turned my head back, both bewildered and unquestionably terrified of what I was hearing. I wanted to believe in my mind I had just heard pipes groaning or floorboards creaking. \n\n\"Hello?\" I cried out. No response. In what is to be the worst decision I've ever made, I foolishly decided to investigate the noise I had heard. I made my way to the back corner and pressed my ear against the wall, to listen for the sounds again. All I could hear at first were small scratching noises. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I was jolted back by a loud thump on the wall.\n\nI fell back onto my ass and stared back up towards the wall, now thumping loudly as if someone was trying to break out of it. Trying to catch my breath, I picked myself up and tried to make my way back to the exit. I say tried because after I took my first step, I froze. I couldn't move my body. I don't know if it was the abundance of adrenaline or if I was paralyzed in fear. I suppose it doesn't matter now.\n\nThe loud thumping continued until I heard cracking against the walls, and suddenly a loud crash as pieces of the wall, foundation and debris were scattered all over the room. Still standing, paralyzed, I stared in absolute horror through the opening of the wall. What I saw made me realize, in that moment, my father wasn't crazy.\n\nExactly as my great grandfather had described, there stood a roughly 6-foot tall humanoid with extremely emaciated, discolored skin, and giving off a foul odor that I'm honestly surprised didn't knock me out on the spot.\n\n\"H-H-Hello?\". The creature, which I doubt had the ability to see, immediately started whipping it's head around back and forth, scanning for the noise it had just heard. Now slightly regaining some of my movement, I slowly etched myself backwards towards the ladder exit. A few more steps and I was once again frozen in fear.\n\nTo my complete shock, I witnessed as another figure, cloaked in the shadows of the dimly lit room, shambled it's way forwards towards me, scanning around for noise as the other one had. Only to my dismay, this creature bore a striking resemblance to my great grandfather. He looked almost exactly the same as he had in his pictures, with the exception being that the entire lower half of his jaw was missing.\n\nUsing every fiber of my body trying not to cry out or scream, I continued etching my way backwards. I felt the rough gravely texture of the floor bumping along the soles of my feet as I pushed on, and as suddenly as I had started moving again, I had tripped on the floor, falling backwards onto my ass again.\n\nThe 2 corpses heard it, and shambled their way towards me. Without hesitation I jumped back up and ran for the ladder, not caring to look behind me. As I started climbing up, the shamblers had picked up their pace as well. My great grandfather had grabbed my leg as I climbed, and taken a sizeable chunk out of it. Screaming from the horror and now the wincing pain in my leg, I kicked him off of me, threw myself back up the open hatch, and closed it shut.\n\nI now write this, laying on the ground of the storage room with my body pressed against the manhole cover. I am in complete agony, but more than that, I feel that something isn't right. Something inside of me is changing, and I don't know what I should do. I still have my great granddad's revolver with me, but I'm too chickenshit to use it on myself. Would there even be a cure?\n\nIf anyone is reading this, I'm probably dead. I don't know if I'll turn like them or kill myself yet. I'm not exactly in a secured room, so godforbid I do turn, I may end up breaking out of here and biting someone else. I still can't believe this is happening. I'm so sorry dad. I should've believed you...",

        "text": "  “Please… please, you don’t have to do this!”\n\n  “Hate to say it, sweetie, but we really do.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA gunshot echoed through the construction yard and the sound of it made me flinch. Everett Ashby on the other hand kept a straight face. The gun had jumped slightly in his hand and he hadn’t even blinked. The girl in front of him hit the ground with a final thud, her eyes staring up into oblivion. Her name had been Sabrina, I think. She couldn’t have been older than 16 and Ashby had just shot her square in the chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Angelo, Brock. Get rid of her,” Ashby said. His voice was calm. Devoid of any emotion, as if he were talking about an inconvenient spill and not a dead teenager. With that, he turned away and stuffed his hands into his pockets, heading toward the black Bugatti parked several feet away. Through the tinted windows, I could see the shadow of a massive, toadlike woman sitting patiently inside. Diane Edwards. I shouldn’t have been surprised that she’d come to oversee this personally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrock was already rolling Sabrina’s body into the tarp we’d laid out nearby. I let him do the work. I’m no stranger to dealing with corpses, but something about touching that kid just felt wrong to me. She reminded me a little bit of my own sister, Olivia. It was the glasses mostly. Sabrina had worn the same square rimless glasses that Olivia did. Add in the fact that they had similar long brown hair and that Sabrina’s outfit was the exact sort of thing that Olivia would have worn, this suddenly felt too much like staring down at the corpse of my own sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You gonna help me or not?” Brock asked, looking up at me. He pulled the tarp over Sabrina’s body, thankfully obscuring her face.\n\n  “Yeah, sure thing…” I said quietly before quietly approaching the body. I helped him secure the tarp and tie it closed. Then, once that was done I helped him carry the body to the shallow grave we’d dug earlier. In a few days, it would be paved over and the office jockeys who’d one day work in this building would be none the wiser to Sabrina, rotting away beneath the tires of their expensive cars. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe tossed her in unceremoniously and Brock went to grab the shovel.\n\n  “Think we should say a few words?” I asked. He just scoffed.\n\n  “Yeah, sure,” He said. “Here lies a dumb bitch. If she’d kept her nose in her own goddamn business, she’d still be alive.”\n\n  “Come on, man. It wasn’t the kids fault we had to waste her! She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!”\n\n  “Yeah and that ain’t our problem. Now grow a set of balls, get me that shovel and help me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grimaced but didn’t argue and around fifteen minutes later, Sabrina was laid to rest. As we patted down the soil, my eyes couldn’t help but wander to the spot where we’d buried Andy about last night. If it hadn’t been for that rat bastard, none of this would have happened. Unlike Sabrina, he actually deserved an unmarked grave underneath a future parking lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’s one rule in our line of business. One golden rule that you never break, if you know what’s good for you. The Italians call it ‘*Omerta*’ and the translation is pretty simple. ‘*Don’t turn rat.*’ If you work in the kind of business I do, you don’t talk to the police. You don’t sell out your own. Andy Knox broke that rule. It’s why Diane had Ashby blow his goddamn brains out and I had no intention of losing any sleep over Andy’s death. The bastard got what was coming to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut Sabrina never did a single thing wrong. Hell, it was technically Ashby who’d fucked up! It’d been his idea to kill Andy at *‘Il Cuoco Grasso’*. Anyone with a brain should’ve realized that using Diane’s restaurant to conduct that kind of business was a bad idea! But Ashby always said he liked the privacy. ‘*No witnesses*’ he said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure. No witnesses, except for some kid coming in on a Sunday night to make a delivery. That’s why Sabrina had been there. Diane’s chefs bought in their dessert menu from this local bakery. A place called ‘*Strawberry.*’ As far as I knew, her sister owned the place. Sabrina just handled a few deliveries part time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the night we’d killed Andy, she’d probably just found the door unlocked and come in, thinking nothing was wrong. If she hadn’t screamed when we’d wasted that rat bastard, we probably never would have known she was even there. But she did scream, and Ashby didn’t want witnesses. So we’d dragged the poor girl off the street the next day and brought her here… to her death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard the roar of an engine and turned to see that ugly fucking Bugatti driving off, leaving us alone with the body. Beside me, I noticed Brock lighting up a cigarette. He slung his shovel over his shoulder, unconcerned with what we’d just done and made his way off to the edge of the construction yard, where he and I had both parked. Just another day on the job.\n\n  “You coming?” He asked, “Or are you gonna write a goddamn eulogy for the bitch?”\n\nI didn’t dignify that with a response. I left the grave, put my shovel back where I’d found it, and drove home. I didn’t sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was two days later that I saw it on the news. A body turned up in an alley a few blocks from my apartment. They reported it as a stabbing and I didn’t pay much attention to it at first. Bodies turn up all the time in my city. People are fucking savages out here. From what I heard, it sounded sort of like a mugging gone wrong. Nothing all that special.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn’t until I went into work that evening that I realized who’d been killed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrock and I were supposed to be meeting with some guys to pick up a package. It was a fairly standard operation. Two or three guys would come, we’d have dinner and when they left, one of them would ‘forget’ his briefcase under the table. We’d take that briefcase out back, we’d leave it for Ashby and then we’d go home. Easy peasy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNaturally, I’d arrived at *Il Cuoco Grasso* early to grab a table. The place marketed itself as more upscale Italian dining, so it was usually pretty busy during the dinner rush. Grabbing a table early was just good business. Diane didn’t give us any special reservations. She comped our meals and that was it. Once I got our table, I texted Brock to let him know I was there and made myself comfortable. I ordered myself a soda, and some breadsticks to pass the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, I could see Diane herself at a table on the other side of the restaurant. That wasn’t an uncommon sight, and she was just about impossible to miss. She didn’t look like the kind of woman you’d find in this business. She was pushing 60 with dyed blonde hair, too much makeup, gaudy jewelry, and cat eyed glasses on a chain. She looked more like an aging receptionist than someone half the criminals in the city were afraid of.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes during our deals, she’d be out there going over her books and sipping on a margarita. I occasionally wondered if she was only out there to watch the deal go down from afar, but I couldn’t be sure. Either way, she didn’t acknowledge me and I wasn’t supposed to acknowledge her. Most bosses like to keep things on the down low, but Diane was the kind of woman who’d kill you for the smallest slip up. Before she’d killed Andy, we’d worked with a guy named Terrance. She’d killed him about six months prior for speaking to her in public. He hadn’t said much. Just ‘hello’ but I guess that had been more than enough to justify punching his ticket in her eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I sat at that table, waiting for Brock to show up and snacking on my breadsticks (the ones at Diane’s restaurant were admittedly pretty good) I noticed someone going to join her at her table. For a moment, I wondered if the guys we were supposed to meet with had arrived early and felt a small jolt of panic in my chest. But the person pulling out a chair across from her wasn’t one of the guys we usually met with. Hell, it wasn’t even a guy. It was a girl with neck length hair that was dyed hot pink and tied back into a ponytail. It took me a few moments to recognize her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the girl who ran *Strawberry*. I think her name might have been Hailey? Yeah, Hailey!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWatching Diane from the corner of my eye, I could see her break into a big sympathetic smile. It was a little uncanny, considering the fact that her usual expression was a death glare that could give God a moments pause. I watched her cradling Hailey’s hands and could see her mouth moving, probably offering some words of hollow reassurance. She was probably kissing up to her after her sister's tragic disappearance.\n\nKinda sickening, considering how she’d been the one to cause it in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “If she catches you staring, you’re a dead man,” A voice said beside me and I looked over to see Ashby sliding into the seat beside me.\n\n  “Sorry,” I said under my breath.\n\n  “Don’t apologize to me. Just don’t try to apologize to her if she catches you,” He said matter of factly before stealing a breadstick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Brock hasn’t showed yet,” I said.\n\nHe paused, giving me a look out of the corner of his eye.\n\n  “You didn’t hear?” He asked.\n\n  “Hear what?”\n\n  “Last night. Someone jumped the poor bastard in the alley down the street from his place. Way I heard it, the cops had to clean him up with a mop…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat Ashby said suddenly clicked with the news report I’d seen earlier.\n\n  “That was Brock?” I asked.\n\n  “Keep your voice down!” Ashby hissed, “Yeah. Not sure who ganked him. But somebody must’ve really hated him. Diane’s all on edge about it. Me? I’m not so sure what to think.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Mugging gone wrong?” I suggested.\n\n  “While leaving that kinda mess behind? No. Someone wanted him dead. Just not sure if they were only after him, or if this is a more general thing,” Ashby said. “I dunno if you noticed but Brock didn’t exactly have a lot of friends.”\n\n  “No shit,” I murmured. \n\n  “Just keep cool. That’s what I told Diane, and it’s what I’m telling you. And stop fucking side eying her. You’re too obvious about it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn’t realized that I’d been doing it again and tore my eyes away from her.\n\n  “Sorry. I was looking at the bakery girl,” I said.\n\n  “Yeah. She’s smoothing things over with Toussaint tonight. ‘*Oh, we’re so sorry about what happened to your sister. I hope they find her soon! How terrible!*’ Blah, blah, blah. Like she ain’t the one who gave me the goddamn order in the first place.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI caught myself raising an eyebrow at Ashby but kept my mouth shut otherwise. He just shook his head.\n\n  “Guess I can’t blame her. The cakes from that Strawberry place are pretty damn good. Shit… now I want dessert.”\n\nAs soon as he said that, I noticed the usual guys coming in. \n\n  “Order some more of these,” Ashby said as he wolfed down my last breadstick, “Let’s get this over with.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe deal went down as it usually did. We ate dinner together and made small talk. At the end of it, our associates left their briefcase and went on their way. Ashby stayed behind and ordered himself some cake. I told him I didn’t really have any room for dessert and just went home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, *Il Cuoco Grasso* was all over the local news, although not for the briefcase of cash we’d had dropped off the night before as one might expect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cameras panned over the ruined storefront. Someone had smashed through the front window and ripped the door right off its hinges. Inside, the booths had been slashed at. Tables had been flipped. Someone had even started a goddamn fire in the kitchen. From what I’d heard, two people were dead although they didn’t release any names. Diane clearly wasn’t among them, considering how the news was able to interview her about the damages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  *“It’s a real tragedy. It’s horrifying to me just how quickly this neighborhood has gone downhill!”* She said, her voice cracking as though she were about to start crying. *“I’ve put everything I have into this business, and the idea that someone can just come along and do this with no rhyme or reason, it really bothers me and I won’t stand for it! My customers won’t stand for it either!”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod, I really couldn’t help but roll my eyes at the whole production. How awful, the crime lord with the ugly as sin Bugatti got her storefront smashed up. If I didn’t work for the bitch I’d probably have been laughing. I suppose it was only fitting that I got a text from Ashby right as the segment was being aired. I barely even needed to read it to know what it was about. First Brock’s death, now this. Something was clearly up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe message read: *‘My place. 9 tonight.’* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just sent a quick response, confirming I’d gotten his message. There wasn’t much else to say. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d only ever been to Ashby’s place a few times. Any meeting called at his place was generally pretty serious business, so I was grateful for that. Unlike Diane with her eyesore Bugatti and that nice suburban dream home of hers in a comfy gated community, Ashby lived fairly modestly. His house was nice, but it wasn’t in the nicest neighborhood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t park on his street. I parked at a convenience store a few streets over and came around the back, as per the instructions he usually gave us. I opened his back gate and stepped into his yard. I could see light from inside his detached garage and could hear a few faint, muffled voices. I pushed open the door to find a bunch of familiar faces inside. Other co-workers, four in total and most of whom I usually didn’t interact with much. Ashby was the only one I knew by name and he leaned against the old Pontiac GTO he’d been fixing up since the dawn of time with a beer in hand. If it weren’t for the grave expression on his face, you almost could’ve mistaken this for a social gathering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “And there’s Angelo,” He said once he saw me. “That it? Everybody here?”\n\n  “Everybody except Diane,” One of the other guys said, “What? She’s too good to join us?”\n\n  “Hey, as far as you’re concerned Emilio, *I’m* Diane. With all the fuckin heat on her today, she couldn’t afford to come out here even if she wanted to. Now, unless anyone else wants to be a smartass, we’ve got business to discuss.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Yeah, like what the hell happened to the restaurant!” Someone else said.\n\n  “And to Brock!” Another chimed in.\n\n  “Yeah, I’m looking for some answers on those myself, guys.” Ashby said. “Let me start with getting us all on the same page here. As most of you already know, Brock is dead. Rest in peace. What an asshole. Yadda, yadda. The question is, why? Who killed him? The honest answer is - I don’t know. If I did, they’d already be dead.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “So what exactly do you know?” Someone else asked.\n\n  “I know that I’m gonna beat your ass if you take that fucking tone with me again, how’s that for a start?” Ashby snapped, “We know that Brock was targeted. This wasn’t some random mugging or anything like that. Whoever killed him, went after him specifically and they ripped that poor bastard into little pieces of meat. Odds are, they were trying to send a message. We also think that whoever killed Brock also trashed Diane’s place. Aside from the obvious timing, there’s also the damage that was done to the furniture. We think the same type of knife might’ve been used.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Who’s we?” One of the guys asked. I think it was Emilio. \n\n  “Diane’s got a guy in with the cops. He’s been passing her some information,” Ashby said. \n\n  “That said, the trail runs pretty cold after this. We don’t know who’s behind this, but Diane wants us to be keeping an eye out for every possible suspect. Anyone we’ve had run ins with in the past. The Russians, the Irish, the local small time gangs. They’re our prime suspects right now.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Any ideas on how we cover our asses until we find out more?” I asked, “I mean, I can’t be the only one thinking I need to watch my back out there, right?”\n\n  “The fuck do you mean ‘ideas’ on how to cover your ass, Angelo? You either cover your ass, or you die. It’s pretty simple.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe shook his head and took a long swig of his beer.\n\n  “I guess for the sake of security, you’d be better off working in pairs from here on out. If you guys wanna extend that past working hours, be my guest. But for now, nobody does anything alone and if you see something, you go straight to me. That clear? I’ll see what I can do about-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a loud thud from somewhere outside the garage and Ashby fell silent. Every single head jerked in the direction of the noise.\n\n  “Emilio, check it out.” He said.\n\nOn cue, Emilio pulled a gun from his waistband and inched toward the side door of the garage. He poked his head out before stepping outside, gun drawn. I saw Ashby putting a hand on the butt of the gun tucked into his own waistband, his eyes narrowed and intense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a few moments, everything was silent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we heard it, a distant voice.\n\n  *“Oh fu-”*\n\nEmilio never got to finish that sentence. His words seemed to be cut off abruptly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAshby pulled the gun from his waistband in the instant before we heard the sound of something landing on the roof of the garage.\n\n  “The hell is that?” I heard another guy murmur. \n\nHeavy footsteps sounded from the roof. Ashby tracked them with his gun, but didn’t pull the trigger. A look of utter confusion was written all over his face.\n\n  “Rick, Walt. Guns. Outside, now.” He said under his breath. \n\nTwo of the guys around me fumbled for their guns but hesitated at the prospect of stepping outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever was on the roof let out a huff. It sounded almost like a bear, or something. But there weren’t bears out here, were there? I’d sure as hell never seen one!\n\nAshby grimaced before firing two shots up at the ceiling. Whatever was up there snarled. I could hear it moving, jumping off the roof, and disappearing.\n\n  “Go! Find it!” Ashby snarled. There was a strange panic in his voice that I’d never heard before. The order wasn’t just directed at Rick and Walt. It was to all of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached for my own gun. A few of the other men were pushing the garage door open and I flocked together with them, hoping that the size of the crowd might deter whatever was out there or at least give me a chance to shoot it before it got to me. Together, we inched outside. Ashby’s yard was silent and shrouded in shadows, leaving infinite places for something to hide. But as far as we could tell, there was nothing out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept my gun at the ready all the same, looking for some sign of movement. Anything at all.\n\n  “Holy shit…” I heard one of the others scream, I think it was Walt.\n\nI turned just in time to see something dark and massive crashing down on him. I only got a quick look at it, but I could’ve sworn it had pounced on him from the roof of the next house over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shape crashed down onto Walt, crushing him underneath it. I saw Rick shooting at it, but it fell on him before he could get more than a single shot off. It swung one massive arm toward him, and with one giant claw ripped the face clean off his skull. I could see flaps of skin and broken fragments of bone in the light from the garage. Rick was dead before he even hit the ground. Some of the other guys shot at it, but I couldn’t even think of firing my weapon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dark shape sprang upwards, revealing Walt's broken body beneath it. His limbs had snapped like twigs and there was a look of petrified horror on his face. The shape snarled and tore along the roof of the garage, almost oblivious to the bullets being fired at it before it dove down toward us again. This time, it landed only a few feet away from me, tackling another man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stumbled back, eyes wide with horror as the thing sank its claws into his chest and pried him apart with a sickening pop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp close, I finally got a good look at the thing that had come for us. It had a long, canid snout and pointed ears. Its entire body was covered in shaggy dark fur but its structure of it looked more human than animal and the fur did nothing to hide the raw muscle of its physique. Its snarling mouth was lined with row upon row of fangs, and every finger of its disturbingly human-like hands was tipped with a hooked claw. The creature looked up at me, dark eyes burning into my soul and for a moment, I couldn’t help but marvel at just how human those eyes looked. I realized that I wasn’t looking at some dumb animal. Whatever this thing was, it hadn’t just come to feed. It had come for us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sound of gunshots brought me back to reality.\n\n  “Angelo, shoot!” I heard Ashby cry. He stood a few feet away, unloading his gun into the creature. It turned toward him, lips curling back into a snarl. His gun clicked. No more bullets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stared defiantly into the eyes of the creature as it raced toward him. He had just enough time to open his mouth to swear before it crashed into him. I heard a crunch as his skull popped between its jaws and finally, my senses returned to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few other guys were still mindlessly trying to shoot the creature, but I’d already realized the futility of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I did the only sensible thing and I ran like hell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI vaulted over the back gate, taking off at a sprint as the gunfire behind me fell silent. As I raced back to my car, I looked back and was greeted by the shadow of the creature standing behind me, lit by the light from Ashby’s garage. I just pumped my legs faster, thinking vainly that if I could just make it back to the car, I’d be safe. But the creature was so much faster than me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne moment, I could see the small concrete path leading to the convenience store parking lot ahead of me. The next, it was blocked by a shadow. I skidded to a halt, collapsing in a tangle of limbs on the ground, and struggled to crawl away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beast approached me, eyes burning into mine and claws still wet with blood.\n\n  “Wait, WAIT!” I called, “Y-you wanted us, r-right? There’s still Diane! *There’s still Diane!*”\n\nThe Beast paused, eyes narrowing at me. I could see it thinking over my words. \n\n  “S-she’s the one running the show!” I said, “Whatever we did, it was her who ordered it!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Creature’s lips flared back into a snarl, exposing pink gums to me although there was less anger in it than before. Finally, it let out another huff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it began to change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt advanced on me slowly as it did so, its body shrinking to more human proportions. Its dark hair faded away and was replaced by neck length, vibrant hot pink human hair. She was completely nude, and her body was covered in scars. Her clothes had hidden them well when I’d seen her before, but now I could see her for what she really was, they told me all I needed to know about who I was really dealing with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHailey Toussaint grabbed me by the shirt, baring her teeth at me as she did. They still looked sharp enough to rip my throat out.\n\n  *“And where do I find Diane?”* She hissed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’s one rule in this business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne golden rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don’t talk to the police. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, technically speaking Hailey wasn’t a cop. \n\nSo I gave her everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m not proud of it. Hell, I wasn’t even dignified while I did it. But I sold Diane out, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. I told her about the night we’d shot Sabrina and I told her where we’d buried her. Then, when I was done I waited for Hailey to kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead, she just let me drop to the ground.\n\n  *“If I don’t find her, it’ll be your head next,”* She said. *“Because mark my words,* ***I will find you.”***\n\n“Y-yes, of course…” I sobbed, “I promise, y-you’ll find her! I promise!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHailey just gave me a final look of disgust before turning away. I saw her body begin to change again. I noticed a hint of pink on her head now, where her hair had been, and watched as she took off into the night. In an instant, she was gone, and after I took a few minutes to pull myself together, so was I.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, they found Diane’s ugly ass Bugatti totaled on the side of the road a few kilometers away from that gated community she lived in and they found Diane herself strewn across a three mile strech of asphalt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw some videos of the crime scene on the news and found some photos online later. They reported her death as just some tragic accident and I guess that seemed like the most logical explanation for it. I can’t imagine they knew of anything else that could turn a woman into ground beef and smear her all over a highway like that. The way I heard it, they needed a powerwasher to get enough of Diane to bury and I don’t know a single person who showed up to the funeral. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for Ashby and the others… that got put down as some kind of mob hit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeither story made it far past the local news and within a few weeks, both Diane and Ashby were forgotten. I was the only one left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve found other employment with a more reputable organization these days. I’ve left my old life behind completely. I think I’m better off that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve only ever been into Strawberry once since my last run-in with Hailey, and even then that was a work errand, not a personal visit. I was half hoping that I wouldn’t be recognized when I walked in, although the moment I stepped through the door, I felt those familiar intense eyes on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman behind the counter still had her hair dyed hot pink and there was a quiet hostility in her gaze.\n\n  “I’m here to pick up an order, under Geoffery…” I said quietly.\n\n  “It’s in the back,” She replied before opening the door behind her.\n\n  “Sabrina, order for Geoffery!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSabrina?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat name made my blood run cold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA moment later, a familiar girl with long brown hair and square rimless glasses emerged from the back, carrying my order. She fixed me in a cold look, almost identical to the one her sister had given me but didn’t say a word. She just handed me my order and left. I looked at Hailey, struggling to find the words, and caught a wry smile crossing her lips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “It takes a little more than a bullet to kill one of us,” She said. “My sister's a bit of a late bloomer, but that much still applies to her. Now was there anything else?”\n\n  “No…” I said quietly, “That’ll be all.”\n\n  “Good. Be seeing you around, then. *Keep out of trouble.*” \n\nI gave a hasty nod and then left without another word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven’t been back since, and if I can help it, I won’t ever be back. I still don’t fully understand what I saw that night, or what those girls really are. I don’t think I want to understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m alive. They allowed me to have a second chance.

        "text": "“Melissa?” I gasped.\n\nAbject horror must have been painted on my nonplussed face. The girl was no *figurative* ghost from my past — I could see her tangible form before me, as plainly as the doorstep on which she stood.\n\nI was eighteen years old when she went missing. We were university freshers, and we’d been dating since college — or the twelfth grade in the States. Boyfriends are often suspects in cases of missing women, so I was unphased by the incessant police questioning. However, much to many people’s disbelief, Melissa’s disappearance was a mystery to me.\n\nWhen I first entered her dorm room, after twenty-four hours without contact, everything was untouched. No sign of forced entry. On Melissa’s desk, there was a sturdy stack of biology books, a Nokia brick-phone — which was ordinarily welded to her hand — and, perhaps most ominously, a lifeless plate of day-old lasagna.\n\nEighteen years later, at the age of thirty-six, that vivid, vibrant memory had not waned in my mind. The most horrifying thing about Melissa’s sudden reappearance — three hours ago — was that she hadn’t aged. Like a snapshot of the past, she was still wearing the purple plaid cardigan and denim jeans from the last day on which I’d seen her.\n\n“Hi, Andy,” Melissa said.\n\nThe eighteen-year-old girl on my porch did not allow me more than a few seconds to gather my thoughts. That was probably for the best, as I think my mind might’ve shattered if I’d tried to piece together the impossibility before me.\n\n“You’re probably wondering where I’ve been for so many years,” She sheepishly said.\n\n“I’m wondering a lot of things right now,” I breathlessly spluttered.\n\n“Let me show you,” She eerily whispered.\n\nBefore I had a chance to refuse, my ageless ex-girlfriend seized my hand, and the world swirled into a kaleidoscope of colours. Bright, beautiful hues of red, yellow, blue, and green encompassed me. They quickly morphed into grim, ghastly shades of black. I shrieked in terror at the dreadful vision that followed.\n\nIn the darkness, I caught frightful flashes of the day on which Melissa disappeared. A faceless silhouette apprehended her in a forest, and Melissa kept crying that she had no idea how she’d ended up there. The shadowy presence ignored her pleas for help, instead dragging her to its darkened cave and slowly stretching her body over itself like a snugly winter coat. Melissa screamed, inexplicably still alive, as the silhouette clothed itself in her body. When the screaming ceased, the thing that pretended to be my girlfriend calmly strolled out of the cave.\n\nOur real surroundings returned, and I found myself facing the abomination on my porch. Melissa’s face started to melt, as if she were a wax candle — the wick being her lopsided head. Her grin was sickening. It wasn’t the warm, endearing smile of the girl I used to know. It was the crooked, ill-meaning expression of something feigning humanity.\n\n“I love you so much, Andy,” Melissa said. “It’s been so painful without you. I didn’t realise that was what my body needed. That’s the missing ingredient. I can’t sustain myself without you.”\n\nIt stretched a gauntly hand towards me, stepping towards my front door as I took a step backwards. I couldn’t utter a word. I could scarcely move, but I eventually summoned the courage to hightail it through my house and out of the back door.\n\nI took the first bus I hailed, and I’ve been on the road for three hours. I don’t know where I’m going, and I don’t care. I decided to post what happened on here in the hope that somebody could tell me what the *fuck* just knocked on my door.\n\nIt definitely wasn’t Melissa, and I don’t think it’ll stop until it finds me again.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "I went in the basement pt. 2\n\n\"You went in the basement, didn't you?\" She stared at me, obviously waiting for an answer.\n\nI didn't know what to say. Yes, of course I did. But this particular job came with an hourly bonus pay, and stable 84 hours a week. That sounds like a lot, but this was supposed to be a very easy position. I was a single mom at the time, with a toddler at home. All of this crossed my mind as I tried to read this woman's face. Was it really fear I had seen? Or was it anger? I didn't have time to figure that out.\n\n\"Yes, I did. The sliding door came open.\" I answered. I never could lie well under pressure, or any other time for that matter. Fear, I decided. It's definitely fear on her face. Her and my coworker exchanged a look, as if they've had this conversation before. She shifted uncomfortably at my answer, and glanced at the house. I followed her gaze, and saw her father watching from his chair through the office window.\n\nHer gaze slowly made it's way back to me. \"Well. Someone should have told you. We stay out of the basement.\" I waited for her to elaborate. Tell me some explanation regarding it's structural integrity. Or faulty electric. Something reasonable. She didn't. \n\nA shiver went down her, and she smiled suddenly instead. \"Well. That's all then. Are you staying for your shift?\" She stood waiting for an answer.\n\nAgain, I was speechless. And confused. Why didn't she come for the walk through, but my trip to the basement demanded a visit? The whole situation didn't feel right, and I should have listened to that intuition. But still, I said \"Of course. As long as you'll have me.\" She nods to me, then to my coworker. After giving one more glance to the house, she got in her car and left. My coworker stood watching her leave, before turning to head inside.\n\nI was put off, to say the least. I started to reexamine what had happened the night before. It's not that I'm unfamiliar with ghosts, it's just that they're usually not to blame. My hairs were standing up, as I started to consider the supernatural as an option. But regardless, I started to follow my coworker inside. She stopped me just outside the door, and looked me up and down. It was that look where someone really wanted to know what a person's made of... And she didn't seem impressed. She pulled a folded note from her pocket, and handed it out to me. \n\n\"This is my phone number.\" She said, flatly. \"If you cannot stay for your whole shift, call me and I will come.\"\n\nThat was the biggest red flag. For anyone unfamiliar with procedure, staff is to call the office, then the family, if they are unable to finish their shift for any reason. I looked up at her, unsure what to say. Coworkers never volunteer to take over on a midnight shift. Not even the one's who get especially attached to a client. I gave a sharp nod, still speechless, and started inside once again.\n\nI took my coat off, and went to greet my client in his office. As I started down the hall to the right, my coworker called out to me from the kitchen. I head back and find her standing next to my client in his wheelchair. He was just finishing up some type of dessert, and had obviously been eating during our conversation outside. She glanced down, and wished him goodbye, then headed out herself.\n\nI smile, and excused myself to the toilet. As I passed by the empty office, a wave of fear washed over me. Who had been sitting in his chair?\n\nMy client was unable to transfer himself. I had made sure to double check his charted abilities before the walk through. Still, I had agreed to the shift. I was already there alone with him. And right that second, I was anxiously pacing in the bathroom, facing a full 12 hours in the house after that warm welcome. I was going to have to just grin and bear it. Besides, if I don't acknowledge anything's presence, then they don't gain any power. That's how the movies work, right? All of this crossed my mind, until I stopped pacing and looked in the mirror. There was just no use in worrying. I'd drive myself crazy that way. With a deep breath, I headed back to the kitchen.\n\nDespite my anxiety, time passed by uneventful. My client was experiencing sundowning, and was still awake at nearly midnight. A big part of the job was just socializing. We had gone to his office hours ago, and my anxiety had disappeared. The house was locked up, lights were off or dimmed except those in use. I remember talking with him about his travels with his wife, which to him had only just seemed to happen. \n\nWe were talking about a trip they took to India when his mood shifted. He seemed to darken. Looking up, he said, \"She passed away some years ago.\" I freeze for a moment. I could see it in his eyes, he was back with me. Back in the harsh reality of current day. He went on, \"She's still here though. Watching over me.\" And then he was gone. I watched as he stared off into space, his eyes glazing over. I replied, but I could tell his mind was already elsewhere.\n\nI took this as my chance to ask how he's feeling, and if he's ready for bed. He mumbled about bed sounding nice, and we set out for it. I helped him down the hall, and we did his night time routine in his bedroom. As I backed out, into the now dark hallway, I shut his door. Now at the end of the hall, facing the foyer, all of my fear from earlier flooded back.\n\nThe basement light was on.",

        "text": "First I tried men. They were like carrots. Stale. Boring. So I switched to women. Turns out they're sparkly carrots. The package is better, but they're the same in the end. Except the chicks want you to pay for the first date. This was the fifth time someone stood me up on a date. I know I was overweight, but jeez.\n\nI felt empty inside, as if I was an old milk carton. Well I may not be able to pull, so I focused on the one thing I could do, sketch. I was currently working on Jasper. Male beauty has been a weird obsession of mine, and I wanted to see if I could draw what was the hottest man alive. I gave him washboard abs, beautiful crystal eyes, gorgeous platinum blond hair, and cupid bow lips. He was the pinnacle of male beauty, and to my embarrassment, I was sort of in love with him.\n\nWhenever I felt empty or bored, which was a lot of the time to be honest, I closed my eyes and imagined a life with Jasper. Like a typical, basic college bitch I wanted to have a penthouse, he was a billionaire, and was madly in love with me of course. We marry in front of everyone I despise, I have an hourglass, he can't stop looking at it. For your sake, I won't elaborate on my fantasies further. \n\nThough last night, reality hit me like a wooden spoon on the ass. A message from Brock University read, \n\n\"   *Miss Grace Powell,*  \n\n*As you may know, you were placed on academic probation last term due to your overall*   \n*cumulative average not meeting the threshold considered acceptable by Brock University.*   \n*Students on probation are required to earn a minimum average of 60% to stay in the program,*   \n*however, you did not fulfill this requirement. Regretfully, we must inform you that your*   \n*admission to Brock University has been terminated, and we wish you well for all your future*   \n*studies.*\n\n\\-*Best regards,*\n\n*Winsella Escortson* \n\nI couldn't believe it. Fucking Brock university kicked me out. Surprisingly, I felt nothing. It was such a beautiful day. The birds were chirping like the sun shined out of their ass, the air was warm, and couples were kissing. I was tired, and I didn't want to think about this. Then all of a sudden, I felt this compulsion. It's sort of like when you need to scratch an itch, but more power. It felt like an OCD compulsion, I felt terrified, sort of driven by this force, to whip my sketchbook to the place where I drew Jasper, crunch up the drawing, ( I really didn't want to, it was my best work), and well, I ate it. I crumpled the drawing into a small ball and put it into my mouth and chew it. My face flushed with embarrassment  as I got odd looks from those who noticed, though most people were preoccupied with the weather.\n\nI didn't want to commute back home. The transit was getting more dangerous, and I didn't want to deal with my bitchy room-mate. I sort of just stayed under the tree, and I watched the sunset. It was around 5pm. Not knowing what to do, I reinstalled Tinder, I still had my profile so I just logged in.  The profiles were banal as usual, John Davis, accountant, 24 ;  Marlboro Wilson, wtf? Mustafa Eglinton, well you know the drill. I swiped left on all these profiles out of habit, though then I saw one that made me freeze. Jasper Oralson. He had the same washboard abs, crystal blue eyes, cupid lips, platinum blonde hair, and beautiful smile that I imagined. I couldn't believe it, from some coincidence, I imagined a real guy. Maybe my imagination was based off on some actor, and this was some coincidence? Weirdly enough, his bio showed 0.01 km from you? Must be some kind of fluke. \n\nMaybe someone found my sketchbook and was playing a practical joke on me? I wasn't the most popular among my classmates. Not sure what to do, I swiped right. To my shock, it was a match! I immediately got a text, \n\n\"Hey Amelia, sorry about getting kicked out\"\n\nHow the fuck did he know that I got kicked out. My god was someone catfishing and stalking me? I should be scared, though I felt nothing. Honestly, I didn't care very much if someone wanted to kill me. I was amused by it honestly. \n\n\"I'm right behind you Amelia\" \n\nI turned around. At this point, I was convinced it was a prank. Maybe my room mate found my sketchbook and was playing this cruel joke on me. \"Jasper ORALson\", really? Belle was enough of  a bitch to do so. I turned around, and shockingly, there he was.\n\nHis crystal eyes seemed almost devoid of any life. When he touched my arm, he was cold, and he felt hard, like porcelain. He handed me a rose, and I accepted. It felt skeletal, but it looked as soft as any flower. I still wasn't scared, though I was perplexed. This wasn't a prank by Belle, this fucker wasn't human. \n\nHe was leaning in for a kiss. Honestly, fuck it, I had nothing better to do. I let him kiss me, and his lips felt just as solid and skeletal as the rose. Out of nowhere, he handed me a copy of my sketchbook. I looked through it, knowing I should be freaking out right now, though I just felt numb. I flipped through the book, and it's drawings were identical to mine, save for the drawing of jasper. He held my hand and made me trace over it, the drawing had the same skeletal feeling. He was smirking at me. I couldn't read his expression, his eyes seemed devoid of all human emotion, and he was still holding my arm. I figured he'd be at least a bit more charismatic, considering he wasn't a person. Like come on dude, try a bit harder. \n\nGripping my hand harder, he said. \n\n\"Baby, I'll get you on the dean's list?\" \n\nBaby. Fucking baby? Really? \n\n\"All you have to do is draw a baby sheep in a 15 cm by 15 cm space, in no less than 10 minutes after I leave.\" \n\nHe kissed me on the cheek, and I was still numb. \n\n\"Goodnight baby\"\n\nWell now I sort of wanted to slap him. Though I managed a polite smile at this fucker. Then he disappeared. Oh how original of him. \n\nSo I did what he said, drew a small sheep in the center of the paper, that's what he wanted right? To be fair, I'm still not fully convinced my room mate Belle wasn't behind this. She could have put something in my water, got me high, then made the profile. She was smart enough to plan shit like this.  \n\nI didn't realize that I had fallen asleep under the tree till I woke up and saw a fucking sheep underneath me. It had fucking crystal blue eyes like Jasper's, gold-ish fur soaked in blood, platinum blonde hair wrapped around it's bleeding mouth. The hair around it was undamaged, and stayed the platinum colour despite blood flowing all round it.  There were holes in it, like the way there are holes in cartoon cheese, and when I peered in, it was missing it's insides, though it smelled like it had been there for weeks, when I touched the hooves, I heard a voice in my head, no longer even slighly human. Imagine male siri on drugs, it was louder than a rock concert, screaming \"MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE MY LOVE. TOUCH THE NOSE MY LOVE TOUCH THE NOSE MY LOVE TOUCH THE NOSE MY LOVEEEE\"\n\nI was trembling at this point and was trying my best not to gag and I wanted the voice to stop so I did what he told me. The sheep fucking turned. It went inside out, the way you could turn a glove inside out on itself. It was messy with all the blood splattering everywhere. The head didn't turn inside out though and those crystal blue sheep eyes were stating right at me. It happened so neatly and inside the sheep there was a gold inscription written in beautiful cursive. \"My love\". \n\nIt was like 3 in the morning and no one was there. I then felt the compulsion to check my grades, it felt like I had to, there was a feeling of utter doom and panic, that I hadn't felt in ages. I was somewhat impressed he could make me feel things despite my heavy dose of anti-depressants. Though at this point, I was quite positively terrified and didn't feel in control of myself as I logged into the portal and I saw all eighties. \n\nI looked over at the dead sheep, and it had disappeared. I received a text from Jasper on Tinder, \n\n\"I'm so sorry my love. To avoid unintended mishaps, please follow my instructions or we make him angry. If you are dissapointed, unmatch, and you'll never hear from me again\" \n\nWhat the fuck dude? Why does he talk like Chat GPT? And who was the \"him\" that was getting pissed off? What the fuck was Jasper? I don't know guys should I unmatch? He did fix my grades, and I was going to kill myself anyway. He is hot guys come on?",

He came from a small town where nothing ever happened, and he felt suffocated by the monotony of it all. He wanted to see the world, to experience adventure and excitement.\n\nWhen he turned 18, David decided to join the military. He thought that serving his country would give him a sense of purpose and meaning that he had never felt before. He was proud to be part of something bigger than himself.\n\nDavid's training was grueling, but he was determined to succeed. He pushed himself harder than he ever had before, eager to prove himself as a soldier. And when he finally graduated from basic training, he felt like he was ready for anything.\n\nChapter 2: Deployment\n\nDavid was deployed to a war zone in the Middle East. At first, he was excited to finally be living out the stories that he had always heard about war. He was eager to prove himself on the battlefield, to show that he was a hero.\n\nBut as the weeks turned into months, David began to realize the true horror of war. He saw the toll that it was taking on his fellow soldiers, both physically and emotionally. He witnessed the horrors of combat firsthand, watching as his comrades were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nDavid began to have nightmares, vivid and terrifying visions of the war that he had never experienced before. He would wake up in a cold sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. He started to avoid sleep, staying up late into the night to try and stave off the nightmares.\n\nChapter 3: The Cost of War\n\nAs the war dragged on, David started to question the purpose of it all. He had joined the military to serve his country, but what was he really accomplishing by fighting in this foreign land?\n\nHe saw the devastation that the war was causing to the people who lived there. Innocent men, women, and children were caught in the crossfire, their homes and communities destroyed. He began to feel like he was a part of something that was doing more harm than good.\n\nAnd then, one day, David's worst nightmare came true. He was on patrol with a group of fellow soldiers when they were ambushed by the enemy. The gunfire was deafening, and David could feel the bullets whizzing past his head.\n\nIn the chaos, David's best friend was shot and killed right in front of him. David felt like he had lost a part of himself. He realized that the cost of war was too high, that no amount of heroism or bravery could make up for the lives that were being lost.\n\nChapter 4: Coming Home\n\nWhen David finally returned home from the war, he struggled to adjust to civilian life. He had seen things that most people could never even imagine, and he felt like he couldn't relate to anyone anymore.\n\nHe suffered from PTSD, haunted by the memories of the war that he couldn't escape. He couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't enjoy anything. He felt like he was trapped in a nightmare that he could never wake up from.\n\nIt took years of therapy and support from his loved ones for David to finally begin to heal. But he never forgot the horrors of war, the price that had been paid in lives and in the toll it took on those who survived. And he knew that he would never be the same person again.",

Private Jackson huddled in his corner, his gun at the ready. He had been in the war for over a year now, but the horrors of the battlefield still haunted him every night.\n\nAs he sat there, he heard something moving in the shadows. At first, he thought it was just a rat, but as the sound grew louder, he knew it was something much larger. He pointed his gun in the direction of the noise, but his hands were shaking so badly that he could barely hold it steady.\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - but it wasn't an enemy soldier. It was a creature unlike anything Jackson had ever seen before. Its skin was gray and mottled, and its eyes glowed red in the darkness. Jackson could feel his heart pounding in his chest as the creature lunged towards him.\n\nHe fired his gun, but the bullets seemed to have no effect on the beast. It clawed at him with its razor-sharp talons, tearing through his uniform and drawing blood. Jackson knew he had to get out of there, and he ran towards the exit of the trench as fast as he could.\n\nAs he emerged into the open, he saw that the battlefield was no longer just a fight between human armies. Strange creatures were emerging from the ground, their twisted forms silhouetted against the flashes of gunfire. They seemed to be working in unison, attacking both sides indiscriminately.\n\nJackson felt like he was in a nightmare, unable to wake up. He saw his fellow soldiers being torn apart by the creatures, their screams echoing through the night. He knew that he had to get away from the battlefield if he wanted to survive.\n\nHe ran as fast as he could, dodging explosions and avoiding the creatures as they lashed out at him. As he stumbled through the darkness, he saw something that made him freeze in terror - a giant, looming figure, with eyes that glowed like molten lava.\n\nIt was the embodiment of war itself, a creature born from the violence and bloodshed that had consumed the world. Jackson could feel his mind slipping away as the creature's presence enveloped him, the screams of the dying ringing in his ears.\n\nSuddenly, he was back in the trench, his heart pounding in his chest. He could hear the sounds of the battle outside, but he knew that it was only a matter of time before the creatures came for him again.\n\nJackson knew that he had to escape, but he also knew that he could never truly leave the war behind. The horrors he had seen and the nightmares that plagued him every night would stay with him for the rest of his life. He could only hope that someday, somehow, the world would find a way to end the endless cycle of violence and death.",

        "text": "There is something about the red planet that seems to pull people in. Maybe it's beautiful red sandy plains that want us to explore its mysteries, and there is something about it's desolate and rocky landscape that makes us feel at home despite it being so far away. I am no exception. Growing up I was always fascinated by space exploration. I would often stare out the window as my parents drove me to school or head off to sleep listening to Neil Degrasse Tyson explain the cosmos. It wasn't until I started attending college, however, that I discovered that I wanted to become an astronaut myself. \n\nWhen NASA announced their new program to send people to Mars within the next decade, I knew I had to apply. I spent every spare minute studying for the application and working towards my dream. It wasn't long before I got a call back from them. I was in! I was going to Mars.\n\nI can still remember the feeling of excitement and terror that swept over me when I got the letter. My hands were shaking as my parents watched me open it. I remember the feeling of that coarse reddish brown paper, almost like they sent me a bit of Mars. I was going to Mars. I was going to live on the Red Planet.\n\nMy name is Michael. I'm 34 years old and I've been assigned to the Mars Research Facility, also known as MARF. It's a large facility located on the eastern side of Mars, near the equator. The facility is part of a larger complex of modules that make up the Martian city complex. It's a dream setup planned by only the smartest of people.\n\nNASA had sent all of the habitation modules months before I would arrive with the first set of colonists, mostly research personnel and military officers.  The equipment arrived and was installed without incident. I began training and preparing for my arrival. I was excited and nervous at the same time.\n\nThe MARF is located on eastern side of the US Martian City of Washington. The first city on Mars, aptly named after the first President. It is a sprawling metropolis of concrete and metal, most of it under the martian soil, but it was truly a sight to behold.\n\nMy first day on Mars was exciting. I was given a tour of the facility and shown around by my commander, Colonel Bragg. He was a tall, dark skinned man with a stern look in his eyes. He reminded me of my father. We talked about my training and he told me about the research projects being conducted. Some of the things he told me were truly extraordinary.\n\nWe stopped in front of a thick glass window that let me see into one of the labs. A man in a lab coat seemed to be playing with a bucket of red sand with a magnet.\n\n\"Is it...levitating?\" I asked with a bit of excitement.\n\n\"Yes, that is levitating,\" Colonel Bragg said. \"That man is a physicist named Dr. Christopher Smith. He is working on a new method of producing energy for the facility. It will require a lot of sand, however, so we'll need to build more labs like this one.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" I said with excitement that he didn't share.\n\n\"Well, it's not something you're going to see every day. You'll get used to it. Now, come along,\" Colonel Bragg said, leading me away from the lab.\n\nHe swiped a keycard and I followed him into a long brightly lit tunnel. The walls were painted white, giving the tunnel a cold feel.\n\n\"You will be living in module 12-B, on the west side of the facility. Your room is already furnished. Do you have any questions?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, sir. I'm ready to go.\"\n\n\"Good. You are dismissed.\"\n\nThe next few days were a blur. I studied the Martial soil with the other scientists and it's properties were...fascinating. We dug into the dirt and tried to determine if it had any properties that would be useful for us.\n\nWe also tested the equipment in the labs. I was excited to test the soil, but my excitement soon turned to frustration. Nothing worked as planned. The machines broke down constantly, sometimes just by turning on. It was as though the machines were malfunctioning before they even started. Everything seemed to have somehow managed to get clogged with thick soil.\n\nThe strange magnetic properties also seemed to almost be a fluke. Not all samples triggered it and sometimes the same sample wouldn't work twice.\n\nMy dreams of the amazing Martian paradise seemed to have gone away. I found myself frustrated, angry, and tired. I was looking forward to getting off the planet, so I could go back to Earth and forget about this place.\n\nIt wasn't until one late Martian night that everything changed.\n\nThe scientists all decided to bring some drinks into the lab and work together. The research had gone nowhere and we were all ready to go home. I don't know what got into us, but we ended up drinking a lot. I drank too much and became quite intoxicated.\n\nDr. Stevens drunkenly walked to the soil samples and giggled something incoherently about spicing things up. \n\nI watched with mild amusement as she put some of that soil into her drink and chugged it while everyone cheered her on. It was disgusting and also a little bit funny.\n\nThen she started to dance.\n\nShe began to twirl around the lab, shaking her butt at the glass windows. She looked like a stripper. I thought to myself that she was an idiot, but it was also kind of cute. Maybe it was just my drunken mind talking.\n\nSoon, all the other scientists joined in. They were laughing and dancing. I laughed but my smile slowly faltered.\n\nHer arms started twisting too much. The movements becoming more aggressive. There was something unnatural about it. The smile on her face vanished, replaced by a stony expression. She started dancing with more energy as if she were possessed.\n\nThe other scientists stopped dancing and stared at her.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked.\n\nWe stepped back as she began a series of spins, each more violent than the one before. I watched in horror as blood began to pour from her arms. Her skin was turning red and black.\n\nI don't know why but I felt the urge to cower under one of the lab tables.  A second later, she exploded, covering everyone in the circle in thick slimy blood.\n\nI came out from the table and almost threw up at the sight of her mangled limbs. Some of them were still wriggling.\n\n\"Get out!\" I yelled to the other scientists. \"Get out! Get out now!\"\n\nBut the others were too slow. Dr. Stevens lifeless leggs continued to spin, spewing blood everywhere. They finally fell to the ground and rolled in a disgusting, bloody and mangled mess.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" I said, trying to hide my disgust.\n\nI started running towards the door when I realized no one was following me. The group seemed to be stuck in a state of shock.\n\nThen the screaming started.\n\nFirst a man in the back threw up bloody, disgusting goo. Then another one screamed as he tried to run away, but his legs gave out. He fell to the floor and writhed in pain.\n\n\"Run!\" I yelled again, but the other scientists didn't seem to hear me. They continued to stare at the bloody mess that was once Dr. Stevens.\n\nI didn't look back and I ran as fast as I could to the door. It was locked. I banged on the window but to no avail. There was no here at this time.\n\n \"Michael,\" someone next to me whimpered.\n\nI looked down to see the lab intern cowering under another desk. His eyes were bulging in fear.\n\n\"I don't want to die here.\"\n\nI gulped and looked back at the mess of bodies in the back of the room. The scientists were started to make odd jagged movements, falling to the floor and getting back up, as if not knowing how to move anymore. I gagged as one of them moved their arm so hard it snapped right off the bone.\n\n\"I...we need to contact someone. Anyone, now,\" I barely managed to mutter.\n\nMost of the scientists were still frozen in place. They stared at the corpses and made noises like they were trying to talk, but couldn't form words.\n\nIt intern huddled up in his lab coat and pulled out a cellphone.\n\nHis hands were shaking too much to dial any numbers. I could tell he was terrified.\n\nI grabbed it out of his hand and dialed 911. On Earth, it would get emergency help. Here, it is just a hail Mary.\n\n\"Come on, we need to get away.\"\n\nI pulled on his hand and dragged him to other end of the room, as far as I could get from them.\n\nThe bloody scientists had started moving now. Slowly, they crawled towards the door, dragging their broken limbs behind them.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" I whispered as they started beating on the metal with their bloodied hands.\n\nA few of them started smashing their arms into the large window, covering it in red slime.\n\n\"I want to go home...\" the intern kept whimpering under his breath. \"I want to go home...\"\n\nThe metal door suddenly made a sickening crunch as it gave away to the barrage of limbs. The creatures tore through the metal like it was paper.\n\nThe ones that still were in functioning order spilled out into the hallway, screeching in pain and dripping slimy blood everywhere.\n\n\"Michael?\" I hear next to me.\n\n\"What...oh\"\n\nA small blot of blood on his leg was wriggling on his skin, slowly seeping into his leg.\n\nHe grabbed my arm, terrified.\n\n\"Get it off,\" he screamed.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I was in shock.\n\nThe little blood blob had turned into a large, blood-covered worm. It wriggled on his skin, moving from his leg to his wrist and back again.\n\nHe suddenly lurched back so hard his spine snapped cleanly, his scream piercing through the air.\n\n\"No!\" I yelled.\n\nI grabbed his arm, trying to hold it together. But the worm had already spread over his body.\n\n\"Help me,\" he begged.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I whispered before running out of the room.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt is now 2 days since the night it started. The gunfire stopped 5 hours ago. The screaming hasn't stopped. I am alone.\n\nIf anyone gets this message, do not come here. The infection has spread too far.\n\nPlease, end my agony. I can feel the infection climbing through my arm where he grabbed me. End it all.\n\n—Dr. Michael Jacobs",

I am a senior researcher at Indyne, a company that focuses on extending human aging, or possibly ending it. Today, an experiment to end aging, that was guaranteed success, failed horribly, and I fear I do not have much longer left to live.\n\n𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘰𝘴 𝘴𝘦𝘦𝘮 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘴𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘭𝘺 𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘳\n\nThere are always risks associated with these experiments. Subjects die, become disfigured, or lose cognitive capacity. Although these are outliers, they can be expected. Both from the research, and the subjects. \n\nThis... this is an outlier to the outliers. We were testing one of the final variants of our Endurnýjun serum, a rejuvenating produced aimed at restoring youth, while permanently keeping you in your physical prime. Our test subject was an older man, approaching seventy years old. Not even a man half his age could do what he’s doing.\n\n𝘎𝘶𝘯𝘧𝘪𝘳𝘦 𝘦𝘳𝘶𝘱𝘵𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥, 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘪𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘥 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘢 𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘴𝘩𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨\n \nWe began the test at 14:00, and I took my place supervising the experiment from a room above the theater. Everything had gone to procedure, down to the placement of the needle in the subject's arm, to the restraints used to hold them in place. I do not know what went wrong, or where we went wrong. After the injection, the subject immediately began thrashing about, frothing at the mouth, squirming and writhing with apparent pain.\n\nAfter five minutes, the electrocardiogram the subject was attached to, showed a flatline. Disappointed, I directed the junior researchers to begin checking the body for a biopsy on the cause of death. And they dutifully complied.\n\n𝘚𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘧𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘴𝘤𝘶𝘧𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘸 𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘳, 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘩𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘷𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘴 𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯 𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘯\n\nThe second Anthony came near the body, its arm shot up, breaking through the restraints and clamping around his throat. We could do nothing but watch as Anthony seemingly deflated, like a ball that lost its air. At the same time, the body of the subject swelled, a mass under its skin wriggling like worms.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘴 𝘦𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘭𝘺 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘦𝘵, 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘴𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘭𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘣𝘺\n\nBreaking the remain restraints, the cadaver rose from the table and slaughtered the remaining junior researchers. I called for security, but they arrived too late. It was like the entity could sense them through the door. The moment it opened, it lunged at them, ripping them apart and escaping deeper into the facility.\n\nThat was six hours ago, and only now has it begun to quiet down. I hope someone hears this. I locked myself in the viewing area overlooking the research theater. I even called in for outside help. But I feel-\n\n𝘏𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘷𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘴, 𝘴𝘦𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘭𝘺 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘣𝘦𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘳, 𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘬 𝘢𝘵 𝘰𝘯𝘤𝘦\n\n𝑇𝐻𝐴𝑇 𝐼𝑇 𝑀𝐴𝑌 𝑁𝑂𝑇 𝐵𝐸 𝐸𝑁𝑂𝑈𝐺𝐻, 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝐼𝑂𝑅 𝑅𝐸𝑆𝐸𝐴𝑅𝐶𝐻𝐸𝑅 𝐸𝑆𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑍𝐴? \n𝐼 𝐷𝑂 𝐵𝐸𝐿𝐼𝐸𝑉𝐸 𝑌𝑂𝑈 𝐴𝑅𝐸 𝑅𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑇.\n\n𝘙𝘦𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘌𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘻𝘢’𝘴 𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘴 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘣𝘦 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘥 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘣𝘦𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘧𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘰𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘣𝘰𝘥𝘺\n\n- End of recording",

        "text": "  Does anyone remember how common PSA’s used to be? To be honest, I haven’t seen one on TV in years but I guess I do hear them all the time at my work and I hate them. Not because I don’t want anyone to get help or to hear information, but because I know our PSA’s aren’t like everyone else’s. In case you’re curious I work at the Moon Mountain Research Facility and before you ask, no, we don’t have any connection to NASA’s recently named Moon Mountain on the moon's south pole. We’re a facility in an extremely remote area of Nunavut, Canada and I can’t get any more specific with that because of legal reasons. To be honest, even if I was legally allowed to say where exactly we are I wouldn’t be able to because I’m not totally sure. I’ve tried using my phone to get coordinates, looking through satellite pictures for the facility, I’ve even walked all of the roads around the facility to see if they lead to towns but no matter which one I choose I end up back at the facility. It’s kind of nice because at least I know I’ll never get lost but it’s also freaky because I have no idea how it keeps happening. These are all stories for another day though. \n\n  I remember some of the PSA’s that I heard when I was young, probably only 10 or 11 at the time, that played on my grandparents black and white copies of The Flinstones and Old Commodore Gray. They were really standard, normal PSA’s about cancer warning signs and heart disease. Just simple things really to help educate people, they were always really catchy too. Sometimes I still catch myself singing the PSA from the American’s Heart Association with the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man. Our PSA’s aren’t like that though. They really scared me when I started working here, sometimes they still scare me. They come through our intercom system, which I’m sure hasn’t been changed or worked on since the day this place was created because they screech and crackle worse than anything I’ve ever heard. Some days the sound is so bad that it’s hard to even make out what’s being said. When you can hear everything though the sound sends a chill down your back, gives you full body shocks and your hair stands on end. One of the worst ones I ever experienced was a couple of years ago, the intercom came to life with it’s always startling hiss and the man who I’ve always just referred to as “Intercom Guy” started speaking.\n\n  “Sector C, I repeat Sector C is under a complete quarantine. W4H33LA has escaped containment. W4H33LA has escaped containment. Do not interact with Sector C.”\n\n  I knew I wasn’t in Sector C but when an announcement comes on you always look for the nearest marker which is never hard to find because there’s one in every room of every sector. So when I found it I felt almost relieved because although I wasn’t in Sector C, I was in Sector D and it’s not unheard of for our subjects to break out of their sectors or for the newbies to open the doors and interact with quarantine sectors in hopes of being labeled “a hero” which almost always ended in more tragedy than was really necessary in the first place. That’s actually how I lost my best friends Marie and Tony. They died along with countless others, including the newbie who I’m still partially mad at. I can’t be too mad at him though because he suffered enough at the hands of the subject he freed, which was absolutely not a slow ending. Of course though, when I heard the screams of the workers in Sector C I walked over to make sure no one opened the door except the people who were trained to. That’s when I saw a newbie, all newbies are set apart from the more seasoned workers by being given bright neon belts instead of the standard black or tan belts given to everyone else. I felt a panic surge through me as I saw his hand grasp the handle and ready to pull it open.\n\n  “Hey! Don’t even think about it!” I’d yelled at the top of my lungs which was admittedly probably a bit too loud but at that moment I couldn’t have cared any less because he was going to get himself and probably everyone else in Sector D killed as well. He jumped probably a 10th of a meter off the ground at the startle of being yelled at that loud. He locked eyes with me as he panted trying to catch his breath.\n\n  “I apologize for yelling so loud, but don’t you even think about opening that door. Do you know what’ll happen if you do that?” He looked at me, putting a finger up to signal he needed a moment. After he finished catching his breath he finally spoke.\n\n  “I guess maybe I didn’t get that far into the thought process, I just figured maybe I could help some people get out, open the door y’know and dash in. But yeah, I really would be putting a lot of people in danger, if I opened the door I might release it into this sector.”\n\n  “I know you think it’s noble-” I replied to him after he finished, “but really you’re right, all you’d end up doing is setting it free in here. And W4H33LA isn’t exactly something you want to mess with. I know people who have, they all ended up dead and missing their head. It's horrifying to have to look at someone’s vocal cords and sometimes chunks of their brain after that thing crunches their head between its jaws.-” I shook my head with a slightly glazed over look and a deep frown. “So really the noble thing to do is wait until control gets here to fix the problem. Maybe someday if you want to you can try and join control.”\n\n  “Yeah, maybe.” He spoke quietly looking down.\n\n  The newbie and I sat there quietly for a long time listening to the pained screams of the workers in Sector C. For a while that seemed to be all there was, just the two of us trying to make sure no one got in who wasn’t supposed to, until W4H33LA slammed against the door. That was the first time I ever saw it or really any other subject awake. It was large, the average isn’t exactly small, usually standing with a shoulder height of about 1 meter. This one though, was probably closer to 2 meters. I watched frozen in place as it slammed all of its 100 kilograms of weight against the door with a kind of fury I’ve never encountered before. The sounds that came out of its snout were horrible, so horrible I can’t truly describe the sound and its teeth were like razor blades, perfect for ripping its prey to shreds or severing heads. It’s weird, I still can't make sense of how it was so incredibly large and how it still moved as fast as it did because it was fast. Not so fast you couldn’t track it but faster than any creature I’ve ever encountered. It didn’t take long for the newbie to bail, practically screaming his head off as he ran to god knows where. I stood frozen in place though watching it, anger and vengeance radiating off of it in waves. Soon control was there escorting me from the door so they could deal with the problem but I’ll never forget its dark eyes and foaming mouth and how white its fur was beneath all of the blood. Intercom Guy came back on at some point stating that Sector C was open again and then the casualties, which turned out to be everyone in Sector C. In my time here there’s been a lot of other PSA’s to the workers, closed sectors, loose subjects, lockdowns from exterior threats and so many others. If there’s one I’ll never forget it’ll be that one though because that was the day I met W4H33LA and almost joined Marie and Tony again.",

        "text": "Grief stains a place. When something terrible happens in a dwelling that thing remains long after its owners move on. You can feel it in the bedrock that something sorrowful lingers. That’s what happened to my old home. The hardwood floors absorbed too many of my tears and every step I took welled that trauma up through the nerve endings of my feet. I could barely sign the bill of sale to the two smiling 30-somethings that bought it when I couldn’t take another step. Tom and I had been like them.\n\nThe baby seemed like she was meant to happen. I’d gotten my teaching license. Tom received a promotion. The stars were aligning. We had each other, and soon we’d have little Caroline.\n\n“It’s bad luck naming her this early,” Tom told me one night as I pressed my head against his chest. The gentle thumping of his heart bobbed me up and down like a boat on rolling waves.\n\n“You’re being superstitious.”\n\n“Naming her makes it all seem much more real.”\n\n“Is that a bad thing?”\n\n“I didn’t mean it like that. I’m only… nervous. I want to be a good dad.”\n\nI kissed him after he admitted that and rose to hold him like an infant against my breast. I think about that moment a lot. Our three hearts beating as one. For one second we were a family. That’s as close as we ever got. Caroline stopped kicking a week later.\n\n“I don’t understand, she’s… the baby’s not developing right?” I asked our family doctor during a panicked visit.\n\nThe doctor explained there was something wrong with her chromosomes. They weren’t developing fast enough, or there weren't enough of them. It all blurs into shock and tears now.\n\nNobody ever tells you about the backtracking you have to do after a failed pregnancy. I had to explain it to my mom and dad, my in-laws, and even a fucking nosy painter who kept asking why we needed to change our spare bedroom walls from pink to eggshell. The worst were the kids I taught. I came back from medical leave to find my classroom wallpapered with condolence cards, each saying in unique child-like euphemisms: “Sorry you’re not a Mom.” I tore them down after the semester ended.\n\nI hoped the experience would make Tom and me stronger, motivate us to want to try again. However, I realized that wasn’t happening once conversations changed from discussing the future to discussing takeout plans. Days became a scavenger hunt of ways to kill time. We became strangers in our dream home, roommates of convenience. I ended it, but we'd been over long before we sat down at the kitchen table one gloomy Sunday and hashed everything out. I honestly didn’t care. One less reminder of Caroline. Of our family that was supposed to be. The last one we sold under-market value to those 30-somethings I mentioned earlier. \n\nThe process of finding my next home during the divorce was more of a smear of time and strange apartments than something deliberate. I jumped at the first one-bedroom pad I could find. It was downtown, as far away from the suburbs as I could get.\n\nMy new place was a maze of cheap drywall and popcorn ceilings. Bits and pieces of every previous decade’s design clichés could be spotted in the lodging’s construction. There was 70s retro molding, a shag carpet straight from the 60s. The fridge was dipped in a horrific Pepto Bismol pink that looked as if it’d been left by the previous residents, Ken and Barbie. The Fridge was complemented by an ornate pantry cabinet made of oak so dark that I imagined it was reclaimed from a sunken pirate ship. Those domestic horrors had nothing on the walls though. Thick dark green wallpaper coated every inch of the interior, paper tendrils suffocating any barren spot they could find. It seemed more suited to a library or smoking room than a small one-bedroom apartment. Light died in those walls.\n\n“It is removable, right?” I asked the landlord during my tour.\n\nHe ran his hands over the siding, measuring the grooves and heaviness with which the decoration had been applied.\n\n“Should be. Technically, the last owners weren’t supposed to put this up without written notice.”\n\n“Shouldn’t you guys remove it before a new tenant moves in?”\n\n“Technically we’re supposed to leave it as is.” \n\nI could tell “technically” was a favorite word of his.\n\n“Since this was put up without our notice, it counts as natural wear. We can have someone remove it… but it looks pretty stuck on. If you’re willing to chip in I bet we could negotiate-”\n\nI cut him off and explained the current state would be fine. We left shortly after and I signed a twelve-month lease by the mailboxes. It must seem odd as to why I would choose to live in that awful place. No girl pictures her dream home having lime green walls. However, I have a talent for talking myself into bad situations. A cynical voice inside me so often sounds like sanity. \n\nThe rent was cheap, and it was only a year’s lease. Lord knows I could use the extra cash as the divorce proceeded. *This would do*, I told myself as movers stacked boxes in the then-empty apartment. I kept repeating that to myself: *This would do*, as if repetition would manifest into reality. \n\nI sat alone at the end of move-in day. The shadows of the living room’s plantation shutters created great bars that etched themselves across my couch and coffee table. Across me. The apartment was always ready to remind me what my new home was. The weight of my circumstances bore in as life sat before me packed in neat little boxes with labels like “books” and “silverware.” It was as if time flipped an hourglass and now sand drowned me. I spent the first night crying, vocal cords echoing like chalk dragging across a blacktop’s surface before passing out in the early hours of the morning.\n\nI wonder if my sobs that night awakened it. Perhaps, it heard my tears and mistook them for its mother’s. For you see, the crying in the walls started the next day. \n\nI couldn’t tell when exactly it began, only that, once it did, it didn’t stop. There was a baby’s cry seeping through the porous walls, breaking against wooden beams and plaster of the apartment. It tore across the living room, bounced around the kitchen, and finally belched into my bedroom. It was everywhere and nowhere at once. \n\nWhen I toured the pad, there'd been no hint of neighbors. No pounding music, no scurrying footsteps. Only sunshine and silence. The landlord clearly knew when to show it off. At first, I brushed the crying off: *Just an infant who lives in the complex. Not ideal, but livable*. \n\nThen - as things seemed apt to do - it got worse.\n\nThe child was a rooster who loved his work, letting out shrill wails every morning until she eventually stopped sometime in the night. The crying refused to fade into the background. It lived in the air and threatened to increase in pitch if I wasn’t properly unsettled. Worse, it triggered something within me. A fifth night of constant ear-shattering noise made my hands shake like I’d skipped all my meals. Hours passed where I could hardly hold in sobs of my own as a response to the audible assault.\n\n“Oxytocin.” The doctor said when I went in for a check-up on my shakes. “Your body has been through a lot and well…”\n\nHis diagnosis was that my insides were mistaking this child’s whimpers as my own phantom infant’s. Internal circuitry flipping mental and chemical breakers in my cerebellum to create a physical response.\n\n“You’ll be fine. I’ll prescribe something to help you calm down.” My doctor said.\n\n*Fine,* a word doctors love to use. I tried explaining that this sensation felt different. It wasn’t a fight-or-flight response. It was like bits of my sanity were being stripped away.\n\n“Have you tried talking to your neighbors about the noise?” The doctor asked in that oblivious all-knowing tone men perfected centuries ago.\n\nOf course I’d spoken with my neighbors. What else do you do about this kind of problem? Two days into the sobbing spells I went upstairs, gritting my teeth to present a kind face, to ask the mother of the brat to kindly shut it the hell up. I tried the upstairs apartment first, figuring it the most likely culprit. I realized I was wrong when the owner arrived at the door. \n\n“Yes?” An elderly woman cooed at me while adjusting coke-bottle glasses.\n\nI explained I was her new neighbor, playing the song and dance of proper domestic etiquette. I peered into her musty place as we talked, noting the litters of pill bottles and Precious Moments figurines hanging on every shelf. But there were no toys. No cribs. None of the accessories kids bring with them. I cut to the chase and interrupted her as she told me about some tapas restaurant a block away from our building.\n\n“I’m sorry. This might seem like a strange question, but you don’t happen to have any children? Or maybe grandkids?”\n\n“I do. Two.” The old woman said. \n\nShe pulled out a framed Polaroid of two young men in their 30s crowded beside her and some blue 70th birthday balloons.\n\n“They seem lovely,” I said, handing it back.\n\nNext, I checked with the burnouts who lived in the neighboring unit. They were musicians whose ashy roaches I’d sometimes spot by the garbage chute.\n\n“What? Kids, uh, no man. My roommate Tony’s dealing with a paternity thing.” A pimply man in a Nirvana shirt explained. He shouted to an unseen member of the household. “Tony, that bitch didn’t bring your kid over recently, right?”\n\nA muffled murmur replied, inaudible to me. \n\n“Yeah, no. No kids here. Did you check with the upstairs neighbor?”\n\nThe rest of the day I became a door-to-door saleswoman in search of the babe responsible. I was met by an endless procession of confused faces and head-scratching. By four, I’d checked every unit and a deep sense of dread filled me like a bottle.\n\n*There wasn’t a child under the age of eight in the whole complex.*\n\nI hypothesized that the baby was being hidden. Maybe there was a fee associated with having an unlisted occupant in the home, or worse, perhaps the poor thing had been stolen. I suddenly felt very guilty over my hatred of it. People hid stranger things in apartments before. During a frantic Google search for solutions, I’d learned about a man who’d made meth in his apartment for ten years under his neighbor's nose. The police only ever found out about his cooking when the chef got lazy mixing chemicals and an explosion made it very obvious what had been going on. The article ended by noting authorities only ever found one of the cook’s arms. It’d blown clean off and lodged in a mailbox.\n\nOut of options, and still wanting to believe myself sane, I purchased a decibel meter. If I could pinpoint where the noise was emanating from I could go to the landlord. The meter included a black plastic wand that made me feel like a TSA agent as I scanned the apartment. I went from end to end hunting the weeping. I started with the ceiling, which came in at 87 Dbs, the sound level of a busy day of traffic. Hope welled in me but was squashed as I kept checking. The kitchen was up next. Again, the meter read 87 Dbs. Then I went to the living room, the bedroom, and the bathroom. Every, single, one: 87 Dbs. The sound never gave a hint of dipping by a single decibel. I thought the fucking thing was broken. I turned it off, replaced the windscreen on the wand, the batteries, and tried again. The sound scale remained static. According to the meter, the crying was coming from every inch of the apartment equally. \n\nI resolved that it had to be an issue with the wand; Some cheap piece of sound equipment that didn’t work right. It wasn’t possible that the crying could be coming from every part of the apartment. It was a mistake. It had to be. I tossed the Db meter onto my fading babyshit brown couch and opened a microphone app on my phone. I hit record and allowed the ongoing tidal wave of tears to pour into its speaker. Ten seconds later, I hit stop and stepped out of the apartment to get clear of the crying. I clicked play on the new recording. \n\nThe only sound my phone picked up was the hum of my air conditioning.\n\nI escalated things. I bought ceiling tiles, those big flat asbestos-filled puzzle pieces found in every office and public school in America. I pasted them over any naked section of my ceiling. The effort took two days and three trips to Home Depot. The result: 87 Dbs. \n\nThe muffling had done as much as a polite “shh.” \n\nI searched for alternative ways to cope. I stayed out more in month three of my lease. I’d spend hours at coffee shops, drink at bars till last call, go to movies I’d seen before, and grade papers at school till my eyes turned red from strain. I’d go anyplace that wasn’t home. But the coffee shops would close, the movies would end, and I’d run out of papers to grade, leaving me with no other choice than to come back to the apartment. Back to the ever-present cry of the walls.\n\nI tried earplugs, five different sets of noise-canceling headphones, a white noise machine, music, the TV… The moans bested them all. I eventually broke down and drove the rental company’s offices.\n\n“Please, you must do something… the crying… it’s never-ending.” I explained to the snake of a landlord who’d trapped me in that place.\n\n“You tried checking with the neighbors?” The landlord said.\n\n“There’s not a child in the complex, but I hear it sobbing all the time. I can’t sleep… I…” A little emotion escaped before I quickly pulled it back within the seawalls of my tear ducts. That was enough to persuade him.\n\n“Okay, okay. Jesus. Let’s go look.” The landlord said.\n\nHe followed me back to the apartment. My keys jingled in my hand as I shook with eagerness, hoping to put an end to the acoustic waterboarding. I unlocked the front door and we stepped inside to be greeted by the most startling noise I’d endured during the whole torturous experience. \n\nSilence. Not even the chirps of the birds or the shuffling of the old woman upstairs pierced the sonic space. There was only the quiet I discovered during my initial tour.\n\n“I don’t understand… I… I swear it was here an hour ago.”\n\nThe landlord rolled his eyes, checking a knockoff Rolex clinging to his wrist.\n\n“Wait, stay a bit longer. I’m sure it will-”\n\n“I’ve got to go prepare an email about the water shutoff tomorrow. I don’t appreciate you taking up my time with your crazy-”\n\n“Did you just call me crazy?”\n\n“Lady, you don’t think I wouldn’t get a hundred emails a day if there was some brat causing a ruckus? Shit, I get a hundred emails anytime that old deaf bitch in 206 plays her Al Jolson records.” He said, heading for the door to escape our conversation.\n\n“Fine! Fuck this then. Take this for a thirty days' notice.”\n\nThe landlord paused and turned back to me. His expression changed from annoyance to the grim look of a shark hunting prey.\n\n“You have nine months left.”\n\n“If you won’t fix the problem, I don’t see what choice I have.”\n\nThe landlord nodded, cold calculations turning over in his mind. His eyes locked on the ceiling. He pointed to the tiles I’d pancaked above.\n\n“Did you submit a request to hang those?”\n\n*Shit.*\n\n“Uh, no. But, they wouldn’t have been needed in the first place if you’d-”\n\n“Technically, you half-assedly cocking those things to the ceiling counts as disrepair.”\n\n“You can’t be serious.”\n\n“Lotta bad chemicals in them. We don’t recommend tenants do major renovations without a permit first. If you broke your lease early, I’d have to note the state you left this unit in and, possibly, take legal action. It’s all outlined in your renter's agreement, which I’m sure you read. It protects me and other property owners from… *less desirable tenants*. You understand.”\n\nIf I jumped ship he’d snatch up my entire security deposit and then back-charge me for every little crack and ding in the place. Not to mention. He’d surely make finding another apartment impossible. I imagined myself cramped in my boxy car, everything I owned shoved in the backseat as I frantically called building after building for a vacancy.\n\n“Whatever you decide, let me know. I’d be sad to see you leave.” He said, walking off to inform the other tenants there’d be no hot water for their morning showers. \n\nAlone again, I sat on my couch waiting for the first shriek from the walls. An hour later, it arrived.\n\nI was out of options. There were nine months to go on a lease that would leave me deaf and insane. I had to find a way out. Any way out. I went to the records office downtown and searched through renter's law statutes like an ambulance chaser to find a loophole that could sever the umbilical cord of the apartment from me. I pulled files for my building, digging for reports or incidents that would nullify the remaining time. Then, by divine intervention (or beginner’s clerical luck) I found two legal sheets hastily stapled to a blueprint of my building’s water lines. \n\nThey were death disclosures.\n\nI ripped them open and poured over the details. Three deaths had occurred in my building. One was clearly outlined: an actress who couldn’t take the constant rooms filled with girls who looked like her and decided to hang herself. Tragic, but nothing to do with my problem. I pushed that file aside and pivoted to the next document. The hair stood up on my neck as I read it. This one had everything in the world to do with me.\n\nThe other two deaths occurred in my apartment.\n\nThere were no details of who died, or from what. All the document stated was that two souls one day closed the door to my unit and never left. I brought the file to the record hall’s receptionist desk.\n\n“This disclosure for a property is missing information.” I said as I handed the file to a clerk, a stern-looking woman with a needle for a nose. She skimmed the papers, as if she’d find something I’d missed.\n\n“It is possible the property owner asked those documents to be redacted.”\n\n“Isn’t that illegal?”\n\n“If the deaths were related to a homicide, yes. However, landlords have the right to not disclose non-violent deaths from things like illnesses, overdoses, that sorta grim stuff. It could harm property values. I’d imagine it’s hard to rent a place if you can look up every Sam and Sally that died there. My advice, check with your landlord.”\n\nThe words stung. That paunchy fading-haired goon wasn’t going to tell me shit… but then I looked at the date of the report. The notion of speaking with that gargoyle seemed silly. I didn’t need him. I needed someone who’d lived in the complex when these two passed five years ago. Best of all, I already knew someone that did.\n\nI’d only ventured so far as my upstairs neighbor Esther’s front door during the last visit. But, as I sat with her in her kitchen over a cup of tea, the loneliness of her abode truly crept into my soul. It was the same layout as my spot below, but with an air of resigned melancholy that stretched from every corner like that hideous green wallpaper. Esther had all these shelves of glass animals and little Hummel figurines - creepy doll-eyed porcelain corpse statues that glared back at you as you observed them. Her walls were plastered with black-and-white photos of the past. Distant friends, old acquaintances, and long-dead relatives. In the kitchen, her two strapping sons watched over our conversation in a photo displayed in a glass china cabinet. Esther was much younger in the photo with her boys. Much happier looking. I couldn’t help but wonder when the last time they called was.\n\n“That’s the thing they never tell you about children. When they’re born they need you every waking hour. Feed them, change them, hold them, sing to em'. Then, one day, they stop needing you… and then you need them.” Esther said as she sat across from me. “They’re good boys. I see them around the holidays. They gave me grandkids, so I can’t complain… even if they’re little shits.”\n\nI almost choked on my tea at her bluntness.\n\n“Sorry, dear.” She chuckled. “My filter ain’t what it used to be. Happens when you get old. Do you have any kids?”\n\n“Uh, no. I’m divorced.”\n\n“What’d the prick do?”\n\n“Nothing really, he was just a guy. You forget about that once you’ve been married to one for a while.”\n\n“My Sammy was the same, poor fella. You stick with them through it though, if they’re good eggs. Sammy was.” Esther drank her tea to avoid going any deeper on the topic.\n\nI saw an opening to get at the heart of what I came for.\n\n“You’ve lived here awhile?”\n\n“Ten years now I think. Since Sammy passed.”\n\n“Are you close with anyone in the building?”\n\n“Not really. There’s something about living next to and on top of folks that makes 'em seem miles away.”\n\nMy hand stuttered over the cell phone in my pocket.\n\n“Esther, I hate to bring this up… it’s not very pleasant.”\n\nI handed her photos of the death report. The old woman pulled a set of readers from her knit sweater and examined the ghastly ledger.\n\n“What is uh…” She mumbled.\n\n“You lived here when these people died, right? They lived in my apartment a couple of years ago.”\n\n“I’m not so sure I should be talking about that. I don’t want to be sharing nasty stories that’ll keep you up at night.”\n\nEsther sipped her tea, looking away from me. \n\n“Believe me, they won’t.” I said. “I know it might be uncomfortable, but I need help on this. I have to know what happened. You’re my last hope.”\n\nThe old woman sighed.\n\n“I can only tell you what I heard and saw. To be honest, I’m not very proud of how I responded. I had a case of pneumonia and… Well, I wish somebody in the building would’ve done something is my point. It was drugs was the building gossip. The woman who lived there in your unit was into them, nasty stuff. I don’t know the details, but I’d find needles in the dumpsters on garbage day. I saw her around the complex high as a kite when she was pregnant. She lived on her own, single mother. She kept to herself mostly. Although she always held the door open for me if we crossed paths. I always thought that was sweet.”\n\n“When she brought her baby home from the hospital it cried for weeks. I could always hear her shouting at it, begging with it to stop. The only time the poor babe did was when her mom would sing in the morning. She had a lovely voice I enjoyed waking up to. Her favorite was that song about the mockingbird that won’t work. You know the one.”\n\nI nodded. The tune danced in my memory. *And if that mockingbird don't sing…*\n\n“Then, I didn’t see the mother for about a month during the holidays. However, I heard the little one. The sweet thing cried hoarse for three days. There was no singing to stop it. It got so bad that I knocked on her door because I was so worried. When nobody answered, I called the landlord. He claimed he’d check on her, I don’t think he ever did though. I resolved to call the cops the next day if it kept up. But, on the fourth day, the crying stopped and never started again. At first, I was relieved. It was giving me migraines and I was sick at the time. I figured the Mom left with the baby for Christmas, or it’d only been a bad spell. I swore I heard doors opening and closing below like someone was still in the apartment. So, I didn’t think anything of it when it was quiet for the next month… and the next. The downstairs neighbors were the ones who called the cops when bad smells began drifting into the courtyard.”\n\nEsther trailed off for a moment, silence gripping us in a psychic hold. I could see the toll I was putting her through in retelling the morbid tale. Regret was painted in her wrinkles. I patiently waited for her to compose herself.\n\n“I came home one day from the market to an ambulance parked in front of the building. I saw the child one last time that day. A fireman was carrying it out, wrapped in a blanket. Such a tiny thing. She couldn’t have been more than six months old. David, an old neighbor, overheard one of the paramedics say they’d found the mom in the kitchen with a needle in her arm. I guess the little one passed from neglect. It was crying for help. I could’ve done something if I’d known. I tried to help… I called the landlord and I…” \n\nEsther broke in the middle of her story, stopping herself from getting too worked up.\n\n“I’m sorry. It’s just a sad thing. I always wonder if I could’ve done something different. I suppose all people do in situations like that.” Esther sipped her tea and leaned back in her chair. The weight of the tale swelled in the kitchen as new knowledge and horror washed over me. I don’t remember a word after she finished her story. \n\nThe next thing I can recall was sitting alone in the dark later, alone with the crying in the witching hours. Sound lost its essence after awhile. If you listen to a white noise machine long enough you’ll hear voices in the static: Ghosts trying to make contact from the other side with pulsating vibrations. The baby’s crying was the same. I understood now. \n\nAfter speaking to Esther, I knew the full terror of what’d happened within the olive apartment walls five years ago. I couldn’t drown out the babe’s sobs, but I could listen to them, decode them. I suppose all mothers do the same with their children’s cries. I devoted myself to the wall’s sighs. They feasted on the sorrow inside me like a bird feeder nourishing a newborn chick. My landlord couldn’t hear the tears. Neither could the neighbors. No one heard the crying in the walls because the tears weren’t meant for them. They were meant for her mother… for *me*.\n\n“Mommy…” I heard it wailing as I - for the first time - truly listened.\n\nI was finally ready to answer. I walked to the wallpaper and pressed my hands against its leafy surface. I felt the apartment reproduce its crying.\n\n“*Free me*.”\n\nMy body moved on autopilot, nails digging into the soil-like surface. I expected resistance, but the paper crumbled like dead skin into my palms. I delved my nails into the barriers, possessed with the sort of strength mothers are capable of when they hear their young scream.\n\n“Free me.” The walls exclaimed.\n\nI tore in deeper, concrete and cardboard splintering and filling between the gaps of my chewed-up nails. Soon I reached the surface beneath. It was soft and porous, muscular and fleshy. The paint on it was so pale that it was as if light had never touched it. I struggled to find a loose corner, anchoring all my strength toward ripping the wall apart.\n\n“Free me.”\n\nI dug further still while blood coagulated in great gobs and ran down the webbing of my hands. Warm fetid liquid drizzled through the vacant groove on my ring finger. I had to free *her*. She had spent so long in this rayless tomb. She needed me. \n\nFinally, the wallboard gave way completely and I was confronted by the naked surface of the wall… and something stared back at me. A tiny eye blinked in the home’s flesh, forged from a compost of concrete and dead skin. \n\nThe infant’s eye blinked as the air of the apartment uttered one clawing word: **“MOMMY.”**\n\nThe apartment wretched, flapping back and forth, scraping itself against my eardrums, begging for every inch of the green covering to be torn clean. The eye fused to support beams turned red as the home’s howling rose worse than ever before. I fumbled back and the wall wretched out a mouth from a quivering mass of dermal plasterboard. It was a crooked maw of children’s teeth shouting out at me. \n\n“MOMMY!”\n\nIt was no help. The naked walls still cried in pain, and slowly their bawling blended with my own. Mother and daughter crying as one. What could I do to ease its suffering? How could I help my little baby girl? \n\nAnd then it came to me as if the child had put the idea there herself. A tune rose from my belly like fire from a dragon’s breath. A gentle coo, slow and rhythmic.\n\n“*Hush little baby… don’t say a word… momma’s gonna buy you a mockingbird…*”\n\nThe singing clashed against the hard edges of the apartment’s neglect-stung sobs. I felt the space’s fleshy paneling rise and fall with wispy breath, a fever of sorrow breaking within it architecture.\n\n“*If that mockingbird doesn't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.*” I said, pawing at the home's viscous exterior.\n\nI laid my head against the siding. Minutes turned to hours, hours to days. Days became eternity.\n\n“*And if that diamond ring is brass. Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass.*”\n\nAnd at last, the cries stopped.\n\n**Epilog**  \nMary and Wallace stepped onto the empty apartment’s floorboards. They let out a creak as the newlyweds crossed the entryway into the living room, daylight giving the spot a romantic glow. Wallace, as he did on all the previous tours, went immediately to measure the space where the couch would go.\n\n“Right here. Sundays we watch football, and then after we stumble over to the bars for happy hour. It’s perfect.”\n\nMary smiled, not wanting to argue over her hatred of all the things Wallace expressed his love for. The complex’s bald landlord brought up the rear, waving his hand toward the inside.\n\n“What do you think?” He asked. “We had this unit open up. Two tenants moved out at the start of the year.”\n\nMary walked around to the kitchen, twirling a mail key that’d been left on the counter. It was rare they’d been able to find a deal on a place. The last spot Wallace and her visited had been 500 dollars out of their price range. But not this spot. This was a steal. She tossed the mail key in her hands like a quarter. \n\n*Heads, they put an offer in. Tails, they go back to looking at places in the suburbs.* \n\nShe dropped the key onto the linoleum counter with a clang.\n\n“Where’s the master bedroom?” She asked.\n\nMary saw it moments later. She slipped off her shoes and spread her toes on its shag carpet.\n\n“Honey, they have a jacuzzi near the laundry room.” Wallace shouted from down the hall.\n\nHer husband was always more excited about the amenities than the spaces themselves. To Wallace, one bedroom was as good as the next, so long as there was a shower and a place to watch the big game.\n\n“We might need to update the carpet,” Mary replied. “Feels old.”\n\nShe crossed onto the white tiles of the adjoining bathroom, sunbeams from the skylight reflecting in the fresh sunshine. Mary shut her eyes and tried picturing herself stepping into the bathroom on a hypothetical Sunday morning.\n\nTwo hands wrapped around Mary’s shoulders. She spun around, as Wallace scooped her up from behind. She batted playfully at him.\n\n“If you don’t like it, we can keep looking.” Wallace said, missing the surprise on her face.\n\n“Can we sleep on it?” Mary asked.\n\n“Sure. Anything for you.” Wallace said, kissing her forehead. “Let’s see if the washers take credit cards like that last place. Gonna be more laundry to tackle soon.”\n\nHe put his arms around Mary’s stomach, petting it gently. He squeezed his wife once more and left her alone in the bathroom. She turned to follow him out when a dull noise filtered in like a breeze. A soft and slow song gently lulled in the bathroom walls. \n\nMary scanned for the source, hunting it down to the closet. It was a woman singing; her voice permeating amongst the closet's mirrors and empty rod coat hangers.\n\n“Hush little baby… don’t say a word… momma’s gonna buy you a mockingbird.” A gentle voice cooed through the drywall. \n\nWallace trudged back into the bathroom.\n\n“Hey? What are-”\n\n“Shh. Listen.” \n\nMary waved for him closer to the walls.\n\n“If that mockingbird doesn't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.” The woman’s whisper floated through the plaster separating the apartment units.\n\n“Guess the neighbors have a baby,” Wallace said. “Does that knock this place out of the running?”\n\n“Maybe… let’s figure it out over dinner.” Mary said. \n\nWallace helped her to her feet, walking hand-in-hand like they had when they were first dating. \n\nAs they left the bedroom, Mary spared one last glance at the closet wall. For a second, she swore it looked like it was breathing.",

        "text": "When I was young, I used to sleepwalk. My mother would tell me these stories about myself that I would have no memory of.\n\nShe said it first started when I was around five or six years old. She had put me to bed one night, then, around an hour or so later, she heard a noise coming from down the hallway.\n\nShe shut the book she had been reading and went to investigate. She told me that she found me sitting at the kitchen table, pretending to eat. At first, she asked me what I was doing, and after not receiving a response, she approached, upon closer inspection she realized that I wasn't awake to respond. She stood there and watched me for some time, as she herself hadn't actually seen a sleepwalker before.\n\nShe said that I sat there acting as if I were eating, then I would stop and turn to the chair to my right. To her, it appeared like I was having a conversation with someone, though she mentioned that I wasn't speaking any words, more like slight whimpers and groans. I'd then laugh quietly in my seat, then continue eating.\n\nAfter nearly 20 minutes of this, I got up from my chair, took a few steps, and laid down on the floor. My mother then woke me up and told me that I needed to go back up to bed. \nWell, I don't remember this interaction, she told me I was incredibly confused as I thought I was in bed. She led me by the hand back to my bedroom and tucked me back in.\n\nA few months later, this happened again. My mother had gotten up in the middle of the night to get something to drink. As she walked into the kitchen she nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw a silhouette of someone standing in front of the window.\n\nShe switched on the kitchen light and saw that it was me, that I was standing in front of the glass, motionless. She walked over to me asking what I was doing. Of course when she got closer, she saw that my eyes were shut.\n\nApparently, I stood at that window for nearly a half-hour, before turning and walking back to my bedroom. My mom followed closely to make sure I went back to bed and sure enough, I did.\n\nIt was odd for me to hear about these things I was doing after I had fallen asleep. The concept that my body would move when I had no conscious control over it made me, nervous.\n\nMy mother found it somewhat amusing, but I didn't seem to think so. \n\nOver the following year, I only sleepwalked a few times. Most of them just ended up with me getting up from my bed and wandering into another room, before falling asleep on the floor. My mother would usually find me the next morning and wake me up.\n\nThen, after nearly a year had passed, my mother had gotten up one night and while she was passing by my room, she decided to peek in on me. When she opened my door, I was nowhere to be found.\n\nShe wandered around the entire house but couldn't find me in any of the rooms. Then, as she was walking through the living room, something out of the corner of her eye caught her attention. She saw the vague outline of someone standing outside underneath one of the street lamps.\n\nAs she turned to get a better look, she quickly realized it was me. She threw open the door and dashed outside. I was apparently standing in the center of the road, all by myself.\n\nLuckily, our street was on a dead-end and didn't see very much traffic after 9:00 p.m. \n\nShe called out my name as she ran towards me, but I didn't seem to react at all.\n\nAs she slowed her approach, she saw that I was gesturing with my arms, as if I were having a conversation with someone. She walked up to me and grabbed my wrist. \n\nWhen she did this, I apparently began to freak out. I started to shout and fight against her, as if she were some sort of beast attempting to devour me. \n\nA minute or two later, I had woken up and snapped out of my frenzy. When I came to, I asked my mother where I was, and she calmly explained that I had walked outside while I was sleeping. I apologized to her, and she led me back inside.\n\n(The rest of the story will be in the comment section.)",

        "text": " \"The Mannequin Factory\"\n\nIt all started when the old man who lived on the outskirts of town passed away, leaving behind a sprawling factory filled with mannequins. At first, the townspeople were curious about the strange collection of life-sized dolls, each one impeccably crafted and eerily lifelike. But as time went on, rumors began to circulate about the factory and the mannequins that it produced.\n\nAccording to local legend, the mannequins were cursed, imbued with some dark magic that allowed them to come alive at night and roam the streets of the town. Some claimed to have seen the mannequins moving of their own accord, their stiff limbs creaking and cracking as they shifted positions. Others spoke of hearing whispers and laughter emanating from the factory late at night, even though it was supposed to be abandoned.\n\nAs the years went by, the mannequin factory fell into disrepair. The once-immaculate dolls became dusty and faded, their faces contorted into eerie expressions that seemed to watch the townspeople with unseeing eyes. Most of the factory's workers had long since moved away or found other jobs, leaving the place to crumble and decay in the middle of the town.\n\nBut still, there were those who couldn't resist the allure of the mannequin factory. Late at night, teenagers would sneak into the factory, daring each other to touch the creepy dolls or explore the dusty workshops. Some even claimed to have heard the mannequins whispering to them, calling them by name and beckoning them deeper into the shadows.\n\nOne night, a group of teenagers decided to explore the factory once and for all. Armed with flashlights and a sense of adventure, they crept through the darkened halls, stepping carefully over piles of debris and avoiding the broken machinery. As they went deeper into the factory, they began to hear strange noises - footsteps echoing in the distance, and the faint sound of someone breathing.\n\nNervously, the teenagers pushed on, their flashlights casting long shadows on the walls. And then, suddenly, they heard it - a soft creaking sound, like someone turning their head to look at them. They spun around, shining their flashlights on the mannequins around them, and to their horror, they saw that the dolls were moving. Their limbs were twitching, their eyes were flickering, and their lips were moving silently as if trying to speak.\n\nPanic set in as the teenagers tried to run, but the mannequins seemed to be blocking their path. They reached a dead end, and as they turned to face the dolls, they saw that the figures had closed in around them, their lifeless eyes staring blankly at the terrified teens.\n\nAnd then the whispers started. Soft, insidious voices that seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. The mannequins were speaking to them, telling them to stay, to become one of them. The teenagers screamed and struggled, but the mannequins were too strong, too numerous. And in the end, they were consumed by the darkness, their bodies added to the collection of lifeless dolls that filled the factory.",

        "text": "I don’t mean to be rude. Really, I don’t. \n\n“Damn kids these days.”\n\nThat’s what people often think when they see me walk by. I hear it often enough, always in such a derisive tone. \n\nI’m one of those people that always has earbuds in. Working out, doing homework, taking a walk through the hills by my house - gotta have my music playing. And people look down on that. \n\nLook, I get it, I really do. I’ll be the first to admit that my generation is hopelessly addicted to technology, with their iPhones and AirPods and Snapchat and god only knows what else. But it’s not like that. \n\nI used to enjoy the silence, the stillness. That’s why I went up those hiking paths to begin with. To be alone with my thoughts and the wildlife, the only soundtrack the songs of local birds cheerily serenading each other. It was beautifully zen. \n\nIt’s not like that any more. \n\nMost people are afraid of the dark to some extent, whether they’ll admit it or not. It’s eerie. When the light fades, who knows what lurks in the shadows? That could be a burglar. A predator. It’s evolutionary, instinctive, nothing to be ashamed of. But why does that stop at light? There are things we see and can’t hear. There are things we hear and can’t see. What about smell? Odorless, silent gases can kill just as efficiently as any beast or blade. Hell, they’re probably worse. We go out of our way to add fragrances to natural gas so we can detect leaks. We put reflectors on jackets and bicycles so they’re visible at night. \n\nThe point is, it’s perfectly logical to be unnerved by or even afraid of what lurks in the spaces between what you can see or smell. But what about the spaces between sounds?\n\nYou might think I’m crazy, but after ruminating on this concept for a while, I started getting pretty unsettled whenever the birdsongs ended on my nature walks. \n\nYou know that old saying, “it’s quiet, too quiet”?\n\nThere’s a handful of adages, movie quotes and the like about how absolute silence is suspicious at best and malevolent at worst. I think we’re subconsciously aware of the chitters and just don’t talk about them openly. \n\nRight. The chitters. Let me backtrack a bit. \n\nAfter a brisk hike one March afternoon, the wind died down and the birds stopped. I got chills. It was just eerily quiet, and I didn’t like it one bit. So I whistled to myself as I walked back down the hill toward my house, feeling much better. The next few hikes went without incident, but I had enough of those spooky moments of silence that I eventually started bringing earbuds with me just in case. \n\nSometimes, I’d stand atop the vista at the peak, overlooking my home town. I’d turn up the music, close my eyes, spread my arms and just feel the wind whip around me. It gradually became part of my weekly ritual. \n\nOver time, I became more and more uncomfortable with normal, everyday silence too. If I didn’t have *something* in the background, even just white noise, I started to get itchy. Chills. Goosebumps. \n\nEventually, I was on one of my hikes, Iron Maiden’s latest album blaring in my ears, a smile on my face and a spring in my step, when tragedy struck.  \n\nWith a depressing beep, the batteries in my earbuds died. I was now alone atop the mountain peak, with nothing but the sound of the wind and birds to comfort me. A few months ago, that would have been enough. But that day, I heard a faint chittering underneath the songs of the black-capped chickadees that I’d never noticed before. It chilled me to the bones for some reason. \n\nAnd then the birds stopped, and the chittering got louder. \n\nIt was maddening. It wasn’t quite intelligible speech, but it had a clear structure and cadence to it that didn’t sound like mere wildlife or random noise. I looked around in a panic, but couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary. \n\n“H-hello?” I stammered out at last. \n\nThe chittering stopped for a moment, then resumed. \n\n“Wh-who’s there? I can’t understand you. Do.. do you speak English?”\n\nEvery time I spoke, the chittering cut out, then resumed as soon as I finished my sentence. \n\n“Right, I’ll just be going then…”\n\nIt got louder after this one. I could swear I could make out a few words this time. “Mine,” it said, punctuated on either side by more mindless chittering. “Listen,” it eventually peppered into the cacophony. “For me. Please.” This last phrase felt … earnest somehow. It honestly felt like whatever was speaking to me wanted - no, needed - my help somehow. \n\n“Did you say something?”\n\nYou know the weirdest part? The chitters didn’t fade in and out, or overlap my speech for even a nanosecond. The instant I made a noise they were gone, and as soon as I stopped they were back in full force again. \n\nAmidst the din, this time could have sworn I heard “run.”\n\nSo you know what? I did. I bolted back down the mountain path as quickly as I could, tripping a handful of times and nearly spraining my ankle in the process. But with every footstep, the beings stopped their subtle conversations, if only for an instant. Every rock that fell down the slope briefly quelled their whispers. \n\nAt one point I couldn’t run any further. I stopped to collect myself, breathing heavily. I couldn’t hear them any more, but that relief melted away as I caught my breath and my gasps and pants became sparser and quieter. Sure enough, as soon as I was breathing normally, there they were. \n\n“Play,” I made out between the otherwise indecipherable hellish noises. Well, that’s terrifying as all get-out. Desperate to quiet the entities, I just started babbling, singing, screaming, doing anything I could to fill the terrifying silence lest the chitters return. I probably looked like a raving lunatic, but I was more afraid of those things than the judgment of my neighbors. \n\nI made it home, plugged my headphones into the charger, and cranked up the speakers on my laptop. \n\nIn a different era, this could have been calamitous. But in today’s connected world of Spotify and other forms of endless streamed content, I could let my guard down and just go about my life. Every now and then a song would have a long, slow fade at the end, and I’d just barely catch a hint of the chittering noise before the next track began, but at this point it was more annoying than terrifying. I slept with a loud fan turned on. I never let my playlists reach an end. It would suck if I had roommates, I guess, but I lived alone at this stage in my life. So things were - maybe not “good” or “normal,” but at least bearable, outside of moments of dread whenever we had a power outage or something of the like. Eventually I barely noticed the noises when there was a lapse in the soundtrack of my life. You know what? Screw it. Life was good. \n\nAnd then midterms rolled around. My professor, understandably, mandated that I unplug to take the test. He was already annoyed that I’d been jamming in one ear during his lectures, but this was college, and he figured if I wanted to waste my money listening to a podcast instead of the class I’m paying for, that’s my prerogative, right?\n\nBut for the test, there was no getting around it. I shut down my tunes and did my best to tap my feet, click my pencil, crunch my paper - whatever I could do to keep the voices at bay without disrupting my classmates too badly. \n\nBut I couldn’t maintain the racket indefinitely, and eventually, my mind was once again overflowing with mindless chatter surrounding periodic, barely discernible commands. \n\n“Kill,” it ordered between murmurs. “Rend their flesh,” it followed up. “Red with their blood.”\n\nOoookay. That settles it. I needed help. Time to see a shrink. \n\nI tuned it out and continued writing, but it was getting harder and harder to focus. My grip tightened around the mechanical pencil. I heard the flimsy plastic begin to crack. \n\n“Hurt,” uttered the voices. More muttering. “Burn it away.”\n\nThere was no emotion in its commands. It was completely flat, with no affect whatsoever. Whatever pleading intelligence begged me for help on the mountain was long gone from the amalgamation of voices. \n\n“I can’t,” I hissed reflexively, gritting my teeth.\n\nDr. Lee approached in his usual stealthy manner and slammed a ruler on the desk. \n\n“Can I help you with something, Mr. Morgan?”\n\nI looked up at him, tears in my eyes. “Sorry, sir, no, I’m fine.” Every word spoken or heard offered me brief respite from the droning, and I began to dread the end of every sentence, bracing myself for the impact of more chittering and insane orders. I sniffled and tried to stop crying, but to no avail. The auditory assault was relentless. \n\n“Hmph. Maybe you should have actually paid attention in class,” he scoffed, and returned to his lectern.\n\nI kept my mouth shut tight, against all of my instinct. I just did my best to tune the voices out and get back to my essay. \n\nI couldn’t do it. I had to leave early. And without that test, I would have failed the class badly, so I just stopped attending. \n\nWell, I assume I would have failed, anyway. But the next week, my school shut down without warning after a mass death that occurred that Tuesday. Officially, it was blamed on an accidental gas leak leading to an explosion, but rumors persisted that Dr. Lee’s night class went ape and ripped each other to shreds that day. \n\nRumors are wild, aren’t they? I gave it no credence at first and just thanked my luck that I wasn’t on campus at the time. \n\nBut the next time my headphones died, I heard a new command that chilled me to the bone. \n\n“Keep spreading us.” What the hell does that mean? Then I heard incoherent screaming. And then, “the first of many.” But this one wasn’t in the voice of my usual tormentor. \n\nI’d know that voice anywhere. That was Dr. Lee. \n\nNow it’s back to its usual chittering. I’ve quarantined myself to my room because as far as I can tell I’m either crazy, or infected by something that lives in the silence between words. Neither option really leaves me much of a choice. \n\nEvery now and then, between songs, I hear Dr. Lee pleading for help. But mostly, it’s just chittering and screams these days. \n\nI can mostly tune it out at this point, but if I pass it onto someone else, there’s no telling what the voices between will make them do.",

        "text": "My brother stills tells me it was a dream. BUT whenever I think back to this I vividly remember the entire experience from start to finish.\n\nI was around 14 and at our week long scout camp outting. Someone took our normal campsite and we got the worst one, Buckskin. It sucked because it was the furthest from everything by far and nowhere near other Troops. Being the youngest, my friend and I took the lean-to furthest away from everyone else (they were all laid out in a big circle and this meant carrying our stuff the furthest).\n\nOur hut was right against the woods and while everyone else was nice and close we were a small dot on the outside of that circle. Now this lean-to I'll call it was basically a big wooden tent with a canvas top and a 6ish foot opening at the front and back to walk through.\n\nSo my friend, who I love dearly, \"got sick\" the last night of camp (he would always \"get sick\" the last night so that he didn't have to help take down and clean up camp the next day). He packed up his stuff and walked out towards the path to get picked up by his mom right after dark. A typical night in a Scout camp is all the kids would stay up until curfew then get sent to bed where they would talk and goof off for a while and the adults would sit around the fire until everyone dropped off to sleep. So the fire is extinguished, everyone is off in bed and I'm bored and trying to doze laying in this two bed lean-to just starring up at the canvas surrounded in my mosquitos net and tucked into my sleeping bag. I start to hear this crunching in the leaves from the woods like someone is pacing back and forth and then it just stops. No big deal, there's animals all over at night. I doze off and wake up when I start hearing it again and the sound get closer and closer like someone is walking up. So I sit up and there's a person standing inside my lean-to holding part of the cover over their head. At this point I honestly wasn't a touch scared because I was so sure it was my friend coming back because he forgot something. I said \"I thought you went home\" to the person.\n\nBut they didn't respond and hesitated for a second like they were going to step forward. A sinking feeling that I still remember to this day set in as I realized how big this person was. It was no 14 year old. So I said \"whose there?\" And they just turned and ran out of the lean-to and went crashing into the woods so I screamed, tore through my net towards the opening and ran to the center of camp. Everyone woke up and the adults walked around with flashlights in the woods for a bit but told me I had a bad dream or it was just a deer because another adult heard the sound of something running off before I yelled. I ended up sleeping on the floor on top of other people's bags with the older kids because I was so terrified.",

        "text": "I don't like scavenger hunts.\n\nI feel like I should be good at them because I like moving around a lot\nand have very sharp eyes, but I'm not because I get frustrated when I\ncan't lay my hands on things.\n\nIt gets worse if there are teams involved. Kids always picked me last.\nThat would leave me stuck in a group of three who would ditch me halfway\nthrough, assuming I even had a partner at all. Sometimes, kids would\npick inanimate objects over me. They left me on my own a lot. Since I\nwas never allowed to participate solo, I had to stay behind.\n\nThe topic of how bad I am at scavenger hunts came up one night when we\nhad dinner with my grandparents. I don't remember how the conversation\ngot started, but mom said, \"Yeah, and I don't understand why Lucy is\nbad at scavenger hunts, she likes to move around and she has sharp\nlittle eyes, she should be terrific at them.\"\n\n\"I'm bad at them because I can't find teammates,\" I piped up,\n\"Seriously, one time, they picked a lawn chair over me!\"\n\n\"What about that scavenger hunt you went on in the sixth grade, that\nwasn't a group thing?\" mom replied.\n\n\"yeah,\" I replied \"I wasn't good at that either. I couldn't lay my\nhands on the stuff we were supposed to look for.\" As I said that, it\noccurred to me that this was also the day I had a substitute teacher who\nmade up a scavenger hunt to keep the kids occupied but didn't hide the\nstuff, and the kids that said that they found stuff just took items out\nof the teacher's desk.\n\n\"OK, Lucy,\" mom piped up, \"you need to do another scavenger hunt.\nYou've just had bad experiences, and you need to have a good experience\nto undo the bad ones.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked. I could not understand why it was a big deal.\n\n\"This is important,\" mom continued, \"You're gonna be going to Harvard\nsoon, and elite universities have this tradition of scavenger hunts. Do\nyou know my boss's daughter, Stephanie Murphy?\"\n\n\"No,\" I shrugged my shoulders.\n\n\"She's doing a scavenger hunt at her bachelorette party. I called her\nand told her you were excited to participate, and she said you could\ncome.\"\n\nI had high hopes that this would be all it took to replace bad\nexperiences with good ones. Unfortunately, it was yet another bad\nscavenger hunt. It was the worst scavenger hunt I ever went on.\n\nThe scavenger hunt at Stephanie's bachelorette party took place in the\npark. In the weeks leading up to it, we had a lot of rain and snow, and\nthen it got really cold for weeks on end. The footing at the park was\nvery slick because everything was just caked with ice. Compounding that,\nStephanie's bachelorette party fell on a day when it was unbelievably\nfreezing cold. Stephanie didn't move the scavenger hunt inside because\nshe saw the forecast said 8°, and she assumed it was Celsius, not\nFahrenheit.\n\nThe ground at the park felt like a skating rink. Being cold already may\nbe quite tense, and I had trouble walking on the ice. Because of that, I\ncouldn't concentrate on finding anything. I spent so much of my energy\ntrying not to fall but I couldn't look for stuff.\n\nIt got worse once you got into the woods because The snow on the path\nhad been compacted so much. I went off the path because it wasn't\nslippery at the sides of the path.\n\nThe space between the path and the ledge narrowed. I didn't realize how\nsteep the incline of the path was until after I slipped and fell. I rode\nright down that incline and into a denser part of the woods, blacking\nout when I got to the bottom.\n\nI regained consciousness and found myself in Stephanie's bedroom. I\ndon't remember how I got there. I don't really remember anything that\nhappened between falling and waking up other than a wet crunching noise\nand someone saying that somebody stopped breathing. I could hear people\nout in the hall talking about me, and not in a good way. I have no idea\nwhat I did wrong, nor did I know what they were talking about.\n\n\"You should've let her freeze to death, you know, she's the one who\nkilled your husband,\" a woman said, \"I can't believe I got this on\ncamera.\"\n\nStephanie entered the room. \"Lucy, we need to talk,\" she said. She\ntried very hard to hide her anger with me.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked. I still felt kind of groggy.\n\n\"Come on in,\" I heard Stephanie say.\n\nA woman wearing a silver parka entered. She had a gigantic crush wound\non her chest that made me wonder how the hell she was still alive.\n\"what do you have to say for yourself?\" she said in a flat,\nemotionless voice, \"you murdered my husband, did you not\".\n\nAll I could get out was, \"Oops\".\n\n\"Show her the video,\" Stephanie said.\n\nIt all came flooding back to me once I saw the video. As I slipped and\nfell down a hill, I got enough speed that I took out two people on the\nsidewalk: a fat man who was so bundled up you only knew he was male\nbecause of the beard sticking out from the scarf, and a woman with a\nfloor-length silver parka. Both people died from the impact, the man\nfrom hitting his head, and the woman from getting crushed by her\nhusband.\n\nThat video freaked me out. The woman that showed me the video was the\nsame woman that was in the video that got crushed by her husband. Based\non what I saw in the video, there was no way she could've survived her\ninjuries.\n\nShe had. Not only did she survive, she retained enough strength to drag\nme out of the room, despite all of my kicking and biting. She tuned out\nevery kick, every swipe, and every bite.\n\n\"Stop it!\" Stephanie shouted. She picked up the dining room table and\nthrew it at us. That was enough to break the grip.\n\n\"OK, you win this time, but I will be back,\" she said before smashing\na window and walking out of the house.\n\nMom came to pick me up. Stephanie told Mom about all the damage I did to\nher bedroom and living room. I told her that none of it was me, someone\nattacked me. Nobody believed me.\n\nNobody has any memory of what happened. Mom only remembers how much\nstuff in Stephanie's house I broke. Nobody else at the bachelorette\nparty remembers anything, and Stephanie herself doesn't even remember\n*having* a bachelorette party. I'm the only one who remembers anything.\n\nThat still meant that I had to replace all the stuff in Stephanie's\nhouse that got broken, including the window. As for the attack itself, I\nchalked up what happened to a bad dream. But then, I saw somebody in a\nsilver floor-length parka standing in my yard.",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/117mo1o )\n\nI’d been told to stay off my feet after a rough job. I’d refused the advice and went shopping with Jackalope the day after I nearly died. Being out of the house helped me take my mind off things. I hadn’t told Jackalope about the dark figure I saw the night before yet. When the sun rose, I doubted what I saw was real when I woke up. I didn’t want to worry my roommate until I knew for certain something supernatural was going on or I might just be losing it.  \n\nI needed some new clothing I could toss if they got too stained on jobs. And Jackalope needed new shoes. Being an Agent, he only wore black polished dress shoes. Now, he had some freedom. He got some pairs of white slip-on shoes. At first, I started to suggest some sneakers that may be easy on his feet if he was going to be moving all day at work. I soon noticed my mistake. With only one hand, doing up the laces may be hard got him. I offered to help with small tasks he found difficult but didn’t want to fully take away his independence. So far, the only thing Jackalope felt comfortable with me helping with was tying his hair back in the morning.   \n\nWe fell into a routine of me doing his hair after we both brushed our teeth. I wondered why he didn’t cut it short after he lost his arm. It would have been easier for him to keep his hair tidy, but he may not like how he looked with it cut. Then again, I didn’t think he placed much care into his appearance. The shoulder length of his hair was a mystery I didn’t ask about. It wasn’t overly important. And he did like his new co-workers complimenting on what hair tie we picked out for the day.  \n\nSince I went shopping, I stressed out my ankle. I wasn’t aware it had been broken due to whatever magic bandages keeping the pain away. I got scolded and ordered to stay at home for an entire week. At that time, we adopted another rabbit. This one two years old and named Houdini. There was a chance that the two wouldn’t get along. Those worries were quickly gone after they started to sleep next to each other after two days.   \n\nI was extremely bored at home. Since keeping nightlights on in every room, I hadn’t seen anything odd at night. Jackalope was gone for most of the day. When he got home, he made dinner and enough for lunch the next day. He didn’t want me walking around the kitchen trying to make something or spending too much on takeout. At this rate, I was actually going to be at a healthy weight for my height.   \n\nMy house arrest finally ended. I went to the same Corporation run hospital that treated my injuries to be given the all-clear to work. I’d also been constantly bothering them for updates on Six’s condition. He’d gotten so hurt on the last scene we worked on, and no one was telling me much. They said he was recovering well but refused to let me see him. I didn’t know if that meant he wasn’t ready for visitors or didn’t want to upset me by seeing him still bedridden.  \n\nI went home feeling bitter and overly angry over the entire thing. I desperately wanted to talk to him. Even for a few minutes. But I didn’t know if that was what I wanted, or something Six needed. I walked into the living room and my bad mood faded.  \n\nI stared at Jackalope holding both rabbits in two hands, a bright smile on his face.  I swiftly walked over to him to see if I was just seeing things or if he really had another arm out of the blue. He carefully put down the bunnies and let me take his new hand in mine to look it over.  \n\n“It’s a fake one. I didn’t want to tell you about getting it because there was a chance it wouldn’t stick. There is still a possibility of my body rejecting it, but I feel fine.” He told me, clearly excited but holding back just how happy he felt.  \n\nDelivering mail seemed to come with really, really good benefits. The new arm was covered by his job. I didn’t know how it was fake because it felt very real. The arm bled if you cut it and Jackalope refused to say what it was made of, claiming I did not want to know. I dropped the questioning not wanting to overwhelm him. For once, things seemed to be going well for us.  \n\nThe next morning, I started to do his hair on reflex. He didn’t stop me. It made me wonder if the reason why he didn’t cut his hair was that he enjoyed someone doing it for him. At least one routine didn’t change with his new arm.   \n\nAn email for a job request came in and I was a bit nervous about going to work. Mostly because I knew I risked death every time I went into the field. But also, because that meant I wouldn’t be able to force Jackalope to stay home. The new arm came with risks. If his body rejected it, he could die unless he got treatment right away. He should be taking it easy and resting until he knew for certain there would be no issues with the false arm he was given. There should be some recovery time, and yet he was dressed in his uniform ready for work.  \n\n“I’ll be fine. It’s better if I use it. It helps it get stronger. I swear if I start feeling off, I’ll go to the clinic to have it looked at.” Jackalope promised as he got his shoes on ready to leave.  \n\nThe urge to make him stay home was just my own concerns getting the better of me. I knew that. And yet I still made him promise five times he would call me when he had the chance during the day. He humored my fretting. I think he was also worried about me working again, so us calling each other for checks up wasn’t just for me.  \n\nSince I hovered around the door talking with him, I got to the scene a bit later than I wanted. Yet another torn-apart body of a monster waited for me. For some reason, this creature smelled minty instead of rotten. A tall man stood beside a woman wearing a suit. I didn’t bother reading the names of the Agents that would be working with me that day. But I already knew one. His head turned in my direction, sunglasses hiding his eyes.  \n\nWhen he saw me, he started to walk in my direction. The woman shouted at him to stop.  \n\n“Hey Nessie, how are-” I started to ask.  \n\nStrong arms wrapped around me, pinning my own painfully to my side. I was easily lifted off the ground getting crushed. At first, I thought he wanted to kill me. But then I clued in Nessie was just giving me a very deadly hug. It took some effort from his partner, but he set me down. I got dizzy from the lack of air and needed a few seconds to recover.  \n\n“Nessie is a bit soft for humans.” His partner admitted with a sigh.  \n\nHis hands raised up, wanting another hug. I gave his arm a pat, still wheezing. It was nice to know he wasn’t angry at me for what happened to Jackalope.  \n\n“You’re the one dating his previous partner, right?” She asked.  \n\n“What?!” I coughed out feeling dizzy again for a different reason. \n\nIt took a few minutes to correct her mistake. Jackalope moved in but that didn’t mean we were dating. Nessie’s expression never changed from his stern and almost menacing look. But he almost seemed disappointed in the news.   \n\nI needed to get them focused on the scene. The female agent introduced herself as Fera. She was the shortest of us, but I suspected her to be the strongest. Her long hair was done up in braids with bright pink beads at the end. Her dark skin contrasted well against the bright tie she picked to wear with her suit. Agents did have strict uniforms, but some simply did not care. Nessie didn’t alter his outfit at all, but Fera refused to wear the black tie and socks. I liked her right away.   \n\n“This body is the same as the other’s you’ve looked at for us. It’s been nice having you teach some Agents ways to look over a scene. We all get training, but some of it doesn’t stick. Most Agents just want to fight. Thinking isn’t our strongest skill.” Fera explained as I worked on unloading my gear.  \n\nNessie stayed silent and nodded. He was built for fighting and not much else. The moment I stopped in front of the body of the creature, I knew right away this scene was different than the others I’ve worked on. The monster looked to be some sort of well, werewolf for a better way to describe it. He had stood over nine feet tall and had black fur. Two long tails were tangled into each other. The eyes of the wolf had been cut out, leaving gruesome empty sockets.  \n\n“I think whoever killed this monster wasn’t the same person as the other missing organ cases. This creature was in a fight before his insides were torn out. The other creatures didn’t have any signs of a struggle showing they were killed very quickly.” I explained and nodded at the body and the scene around us.  \n\nWe stood in a clearing in the middle of a forest. Deep cuts from claws were torn into the bark of the trees. Some smaller trees had even been uprooted. I thought I saw some bullet holes in the bark as well but needed to get closer to confirm. Fera uncrossed her arms and got closer to the body very interested. \n\n“Most likely a Hunter killed this wolf. The wolf killed humans and used them for magic so it’s reasonable for him to be on a list. We did have our eyes on him, but with so many other cases he wasn’t a priority.” She explained.  \n\nA common thing I’ve heard was just how swamped The Corporation was. They needed more manpower that just didn’t seem to be available. A thought came to mind, and I let it slip.  \n\n“The Mailing Company Jackalope started working for repaired his sight and gave him a fake arm. How come The Corporation didn’t? I understand he went against orders to save my life but with the lack of Agents I would think they wouldn’t fire them for a single offense.” I said and their expressions changed.  \n\nNessie looked away refusing to show how he felt about the entire thing. Fera bit the bullet to start a difficult conversation.  \n\n“Jackalope is... Well... We’re not certain of what he is. When he needed to use his powers, they were often unstable and unreliable. I think Lupa wanted a reason to get rid of him. That and... You see...” She paused unsure of the best way to word her thoughts. “If it’s confirmed he was made by the methods The Corporation suspects he’ll be killed on principle. It sounds harsh but man, I get it. I like the guy and all, but I really hope he’s not what we think he is. I don’t know how you could deal with him being in your house if you found out his real origins. Just thinking about it gives me the creeps.”  \n\nUnable to help herself, she hugged her arms, and a slight shake went through her body. She didn’t outright say what Jackalope could be. And if I was meant to know, she would have. I felt a small amount of annoyance at her words. A hot feeling came to my stomach and I pushed it down.  \n\n“He saved my life by offering up his own. It’s a miracle he didn’t die and went go through the company he devoted his life to rejecting him without complaints. I don’t care how he was made. Jackalope is a better person than anyone else I’ve met.”  \n\nMy tone may have come out too harshly. I turned my head away expecting her to be upset that I snapped a little. Instead, she forced a smile knowing where I was coming from.  \n\n“Sorry. I get you. It was wrong of me to judge him based on unfounded assumptions.” She replied.  \n\nI wasn’t expecting an apology. It made me feel as if I was in the wrong but we quickly got past the conversation. They both wanted to get the body cleared up so they could move on to a different case. Because a Hunter was the most likely suspect, they didn’t need the same kind of coverage normal cases did. Rouge Hunters killing monsters didn’t get a trial like regular humans. I didn't need DNA, or every bullet fired drawn out into a diagram. The fact that this werewolf had been on a list of monsters to be killed helped The Hunter's case. If they were caught, the punishment would only be a slap on the wrist for not asking to kill the wolf first.  \n\nWe were able to get the photos and needed documentation fairly quickly. Fera spoke as I worked, and I got her up to speed with what I was doing. She nodded along but it was easy to tell she was the type to shoot first and ask questions later. At least Nessie was levelheaded enough to do any thinking of the pair. He hadn’t said a word to me the entire time. I wondered if he couldn't speak or was a bit shy.   \n\nThe final task was removing a dagger sticking out of the neck of the wolf. I found it odd the weapon was left behind or even used in the first place. From what I saw, The Hunter favored guns. Such a small dagger didn’t seem to be useful, but I wasn’t certain if it had been embedded with magic. I almost pulled the dagger out myself and thought better of it. I asked Nessie to do it in case the blade held some sort of power I wasn’t aware of.  \n\nIt turns out my suspicions were correct. However, there wasn’t anything we could do to avoid the trap the moment we decided to take out that blade. Nessie easily removed the dagger from the dead flesh, and a light came from under our feet. Fera shouted at us to move, but the light grew too intense. The body of the wolf was taken into that light, the spell using up the flesh to gain enough power to transport three people to an unknown location.  \n\nAfter the flash of light, darkness overtook my vision. I wasn’t aware of it, but I passed out to awaken an unknown amount of time later on a cold hard floor.   \n\nMy head swam with pain. It took a few minutes to recover enough to sit up. Whoever tied us up removed my jacket. Along with Fera’s suit jacket and Nessie’s. She was awake, but he hadn’t stirred just yet. A thin chain wrapped my wrists. With some effort, I could break through it. I didn’t just in case someone was watching us. All three of us were inside a wide circle drawn onto the floor with either red paint, or blood. Odd symbols surrounded the circle making me very scared of what they meant. I didn’t want to move in case I set off another trap.  \n\nThe room was dark. Only a single light hung overhead. A few cluttered desks stood around us covered in weapons and caked with countless blood stains. The cement floor was also stained with old blood. The smell of the dank air turned my stomach.  \n\n“Are you alright?” I whispered to Fera.  \n\nShe gave me an uneasy smile. She wasn’t human and should be the one checking in on the weakest member of the group. She let Nessie keep sleeping as she scanned where we found ourselves.  \n\n“I can't get my hands free, but I’ll figure something out.” She admitted in a nervous tone.  \n\nI gave her a questioning look. Did the person who tied us up use something thicker for her? Since Nessie was on his side, I saw he also had his wrists tied with the same thin loops of a silver chain. Could these two not break through silver because they weren’t human?   \n\nThe sound of footsteps getting closer made us snap our attention in the other direction. I regretted not snapping the chain the moment I woke up and made a run for one of the weapons. Nessie finally stirred. He slowly sat up, his sunglasses missing to reveal a set of pastel rose eyes. Even in the dangerous situation we were in, I did a double take at them.   \n\n“I wasn’t expecting to catch three of you. The more the better, huh?”  \n\nThe man who stepped into the light was not one to mess with. He kept a gun in his hand, a finger very close to the trigger. The hilt of a sword peeked from under his long and filthy coat. His face was covered in old scars and a few new cuts from a recent werewolf fight. His dark eyes stared down at us and his voice held no emotion. This man looked to be a walking corpse.   \n\nHe took a step closer and into the circle. Fera was sweating but tried to hide her stress.   \n\n“You can let us go. No one is going to be upset you killed that wolf we-” She started but I spoke up.  \n\n“No one is going to come and save us.” I said and it got The Hunter’s attention.  \n\nHe stared down with a rock-hard expression on his face. Fera looked confused over the conversation. This man didn’t kidnap us because he didn’t want to get arrested for killing monsters. He hated the supernatural and wanted to kill all of them. He knew his limitations. Instead of killing as many monsters as he could, he decided to take down the most powerful one he could get a hold of. His plan was to kidnap some Agents hoping their boss would swoop in. This guy had no idea Lupa would gladly let us die instead of risking his safety.  \n\n“Now, how can you be so sure of that?” The Hunter asked with a dangerous glint in his eye.  \n\n“You made some sort of powerful weapon, didn’t you? A human has no hope of winning against an Office Director, or a stronger Agent. You would not try to pull this off unless you had an ace up your sleeve.” I responded feeling the air grow tense.  \n\nThe Hunter did not like my guess. He raised his gun and fired it toward my face. Fera blocked the bullet, her body between us and her braided hair knocking away two more bullets that came. She suddenly was painfully forced down to the ground. Her face twisted in anger and pain. A set of sharp teeth showed through her snarling mouth wanting to rip the man’s face off.   \n\n“This spell suppresses supernatural creatures, especially if they have a murderous intent. You won’t be able to move while you want to kill me.” The man said not sounding very impressed.  \n\nHe turned his attention towards Nessie who remained calm the entire interaction. My stomach turned as he got closer to my Agent friend and Nessie started to back up. He was stopped at the edge of the circle, unable to go any further.   \n\n“You’re right. I did create a weapon. Swords like these are easy to make, but most choose not to use them. I can kill any creature, within reason at the cost of my own life. Your boss should be easy enough to take down.” The Hunter said and gave me a quick look from over his shoulder.  \n\n“Why do this? I know you hate monsters, but The Corporation fights against them. They may not be human, but they’re on your side.” I argued.  \n\n“Do you really believe that? The Corporation was made by The Silver King to keep the balance. But what even is that balance? From what I’ve seen, things are very fucking unfair. There is no balance. That King favors creatures and wants to keep the biggest population of them possible by letting them feed on humans. Monsters only get punished if they eat too many resources.”   \n\nI started to feel sick at his words. I didn’t have any proof to what he was saying was wrong. It was all a possibility. And I hated how true the theory sounded. Regardless, I needed to get both Fera and Nessie out of there. They were both good people who didn’t deserve to be used as bait, or worse.  \n\nThe Hunter still had a gun in his hand. I worked at breaking the chain keeping my arms behind my back without being obvious. If he looked in my direction at the wrong time, I risked getting my face blown off. As carefully as possible, I shifted around almost able to snap the chain.  \n\nThe Hunter reached into his coat to bring out a small metal tube. He pressed his thumb against the bottom causing a long needle to shoot out. The sharp point stopped half an inch away from Nessie’s eye. I saw the Agent start to sweat and breathe heavily, but he didn’t dare move. A choking fear pooled in my heart. My eyes were looking for a weapon to grab before The Hunter had a chance to fire his gun.  \n\n“I heard you’re a shy one. You’ll give me better reactions than the woman over there. I’ll only use you for a few photos, then I’ll be kind enough to end your life.” The Hunter spoke, words cold as ice.  \n\nHe lowered the metal tip and easily took off Nessie’s top button. I found myself grinding my teeth trying to stay calm. If I didn’t plan out my movements, we would all be dead. Another button came off and my face flushed with rage. The shirt was parted just enough to show a set of pastel emerald scales over Nessie’s collarbone. My new friend met my eyes, his face faltered for a second. The needle tip went to open his shirt further and he turned his head away in shame, lips pressed in a tight line.  \n\nI could not stay calm. Without a second thought, I snapped the silver chain to charge at The Hunter. I caught him off guard. His frame was larger than mine, so I didn’t do much when I rammed into his back. He dropped his gun but brought the metal needle around to painfully bring it down into my shoulder. I screamed and put everything I had into pushing him out of the circle and away from the two Agents.  \n\nHe tripped causing us to pile into each other. This man trained his body against fighting monsters for years. But he wasn’t expecting someone to fight dirty. I didn’t have the same strength so resorted to biting, wild punches, and hair-pulling. He was more annoyed than hurt. I found my body getting tossed aside and rolling hard against a table.  \n\nA large hammer fell to the ground in front of my face. I snatched it up and got a good hit on the other man’s hand before he could reach for another weapon. The hammer came down as fast as I could manage. Some swings hit home, while others did not. He fell back against another worktable, his bleeding hand finding a half-finished wooden staff. I wasn’t able to dodge a few blows to my face from that.  \n\nWe both backed off panting, in pain and bleeding. His eyes wild and confused. I’d broken through a silver chain and a circle that was meant to hold supernatural creatures. He never once considered I may be human. In his mind, I was a powerful creature he'd never faced before. His hand flew to his side to the sword that was meant for Lupa’s life. The unknown factor caused him to act in a way he normally wouldn’t.  \n\nFera screamed unable to do anything to help. The Hunter charged forwards, the delicate sword pointing directly at my stomach. I didn’t move out of the way soon enough. The tip of the blade pressed against my skin, and then a bust of power exploded from it. We were all knocked back, the blade shattering into pieces and gauging the cement floor as they flew off.   \n\nThe sword was meant to kill any supernatural creature at the cost of the life who used it. It turns out, wording mattered a lot when it came to magic. I wasn’t a creature, so the spell broke. The magic blew back in all of our faces, disorienting the four of us.   \n\nI stood up, ears ringing and eyesight slowly returning to normal. Fera was finally shaking off the spell that kept her bound. She was on one knee shouting something. Nessie started moving but got to his target far too late.  \n\nWording with magic spells may fail you, but bullets always did their job. I heard a pop. The hunter got blown back and landed next to his gun. He grabbed it, rolled over, and fired.   \n\nNessie’s body exploded outwards into a large creature. A clawed hand came down on The Hunter pinning him to the ground before he could fire again. I stood in awe seeing a real living creature for the first time. They really were something else when they still breathed instead of the corpses I’ve dealt with so far.  \n\nNessie looked to be some sort of dragon that nearly took up the entire room. His wings pinned close to his body shimmered a dazzling green. His face hidden under long hair that looked like wet seaweed. A set of light pink eyes stared in my direction. Somehow, his monstrous face looked concerned. \n\nIt wasn’t until my legs gave out from under me that I realized why. Warm blood poured down from my stomach. I made a weak attempt at putting pressure on the wound. Darkness started at the corners of my vision as I fell.  \n\nFera caught me before I smashed my face against the hard ground. For being so strong, she was a very soft person.  \n\nWhen my eyes opened again, I felt heavy. My head refused to move, and my stomach hurt. It took me a few minutes to gather myself enough to look around where I’d been taken. The room looked like one in a small clinic. Someone worked away at some paperwork at a small desk next to my bed. I didn’t lift my head, only looked over.  \n\n“Can... I touch your cheek...?” My voice sounded raspy, but it was worth asking.  \n\nThe person turned their head, a very cute smile on their face. They wore gender-neutral blue scrubs, but I assumed they might be male. Their body was made of some sort of pale transparent material. The light shone off the surface in an appealing way. I really wanted to know what their skin felt like but thought it may be too personal of a question to ask to take their hand.  \n\n“I’m Robin, and yes you may because you asked nicely.”  \n\nThey reached over to help me sit up and gave me a cup of water. After Robin knew, I wasn’t going to pass out again. They let me poke their cheek. It was a nice texture that would make a perfect stress ball.  \n\n“You were shot, and we were forced to use some vampire blood to heal you. It burns up your body fat and only heals the life-threatening injuries first. I would like you to rest for another few hours, but you’re free to go home whenever. Lots of bed rest and a high-calorie diet to recover the weight.” Robin said.  \n\nI raised my hand to feel my still bruised face. I was thankful for not having a bullet wound but felt a bit bitter over still having all the other cuts and bruises. I did lose a lot of weight. My arms looked thinner than ever before Jackalope arrived to start cooking dinner for us.  \n\n“Jackalope can handle the food. I swear, I’ve never eaten three meals a day until he showed up.” I mentioned.  \n\n“I spoke with him. It was a bit unprofessional, but your phone kept ringing. You don’t have an emergency contact, so I just told him you were held back due to work. If he’s your partner, you should update your contact-”  \n\n“Roommate.” I corrected Robin.  \n\nThe creature gave me a cryptic smile but accepted the answer. My phone was handed over and I couldn’t bring myself to send a message or call. I didn’t want to worry him, but Jackalope was going to find out what happened after he saw how bad my face looked when I got home. A message came through and I saw someone added Nessie to my phone. He may be shy in person, but he texted a lot. And with a lot of cute faces and icons, I didn’t even know how he made them. I swear I saw an uwu in his messages and I needed to look up what that meant. I was so traumatized by his texting style it took me a few minutes to recover and ask other questions I had.  \n\n“Do you know what’s going to happen to that Hunter?” I asked wondering how badly Nessie hurt him.  \n\nI think Nessie acted first because he knew if Fera got a hold of the man, she would have killed him.   \n\n“It’s hard to say. I think in this case The Silver King is going to look over it and decide what to do. Neither organization can come to an impartial decision.” Robin said while they pressed a pen to their bottom lip. \n\nI assumed The Silver King was too powerful to bother with such small cases. I hoped he went easy on the man. I wanted to hate him for threatening Nessie and Fera, but I couldn’t bring myself to. That man must have been through a lot to dedicate his entire life to hatred. Or maybe I just didn’t want him to die because we were both human.   \n\n“The Hunter said something that’s bothered me about The Corporation...” I started and Robin knew where I was going.  \n\nThey set the pen down to give me their entire attention. They’d heard this theory before and knew it had been the cause of so many supernatural deaths. Some justified, and others not so much. If a Hunter came across Robin, they risked getting killed because of the conspiracy some hurt and confused humans cooked up.  \n\n“It’s very hard to prove a negative. There is a balance only the Silver King and understand fully. After what those Hunters have been through, it’s easy for them to see the world as completely against them. Yes, all creatures have a limit on how many humans they can kill given to them by The Silver King. If they go over that limit, they are punished. The Corporation was created by our King because no matter how powerful, he is just a single person. He cannot be in two places at once. So, he delegated tasks. Then The Corporation started to take matters into its own hands. Their goal is to ensure there are no more unneeded deaths of humans by supernatural means. Most Agents work because it’s seen as an honorable position acting out the King’s will. But others do the job for a simple fact most people tend to overlook.”  \n\nI listened to Robin, and he didn’t even need to tell me the rest. I already knew what he was going to say after meeting with so many Agents. Six talked to me and told me information when he didn’t need to. Nessie sent messages worried about my well-being, and Fera wanted to kill a man because he threatened my life. There were some creatures out there that didn’t respect human life. Like Lupa who only cared about the respect his job would bring, or the God who killed for no other reason than he could. Those kinds of creatures were the reason why The Hunters existed.  \n\n“Most Agents save humans because they want you to live.” Robin finished.   \n\nA round face squished into a grin. There wasn’t any proof that these creatures weren’t using us for livestock. But I trusted that smile. Even if my entire race was simply allowed to live to feed another species, I was fine with that. It meant people I cared about kept living. I knew that was a selfish way to see things and, at that moment, didn’t care.   \n\n“This is a bit off-topic, but has Jackalope received a new arm recently?” Robin brought up.  \n\nThe mention of the new arm got me worried. There was a chance of the arm getting rejected and I feared Jackalope may be at a higher risk for such a thing for a reason I wasn’t aware of.  \n\n“Is it going to fall off?” I asked, worry clear in my voice.  \n\n“I hope not. But please keep an eye on him. Come to the clinic if you have any worries, or if any kind of new symptoms appears. We would rather see you two a hundred times for nothing than you need us and not show up one time. Both of you need plenty of rest, good food, and light exercise. You’re only roommates, right? I’ll need to think of suggestions to keep you active while recovering.” Robin said and turned away back to his forms.  \n\nI wasn’t able to ask him to elaborate on what he wanted to suggest exercise-wise because Fera came barging in. She gave me a crushing hug and apologized for the fact I got shot. I’d almost forgotten about all of that. We got her settled down and I was glad she came by. I had some questions for her.  \n\n“I saw something in my place the other night. I’m worried it was the same God that took Jackalope’s arm. Is there a way to confirm that? Or get rid of him if it is a God bothering us?” I asked her thinking that she might know more about supernatural solutions than myself.  \n\nShe frowned and crossed her arms. Robin also sat thinking fiddling with a pen.   \n\n“Well, Gods don’t live on this level of existence. They can interact through emotions, prayers, and thoughts. I think Jackalope told you to keep talking about those deaths, right? That gave the God more power to act. I know this sounds lame, but just don’t think about it. Get a hobby. Focus on something else. You have a really cute ex-Agent in your house. I'm surprised you two haven’t been too busy with each other to even worry about this.” She said in a casual tone.  \n\n“What... What does that mean? We’re just roommates.” I corrected her.   \n\nMy ears felt so hot it made the rest of my body cold. Is this how everyone at The Corporation saw our living arrangement?  \n\n“Just roommates.” Robin chipped in hoping that helped.  \n\n“I’m just messing with you.” Fera said like a liar.   \n\nI wanted to call her out but felt too tired to care. She agreed to help me get home. I really didn’t know where this clinic was located. For all I knew, I ended up in a different country. With some magic, Fera dropped us off in front of my house. She gave me her number to ask her any questions that may come to mind. I was barely inside the front door when Jackalope reached me with two rabbits at his heels.  \n\nHoudini warmed up to Pesto so well. I'm glad we got the cute little black rabbit. I bent down to pick them up so their soft fur could relax my fried nerves. A smell coming from the kitchen caused me to freeze and I didn’t even hear what Jackalope said for a few seconds.  \n\n“Are you cooking Menudo?” I asked him handing over a rabbit.  \n\n“I found a recipe book while cleaning the kitchen. I wanted to try and make something different.” He admitted, a bit confused over my shock.  \n\n“That... Must have been my mothers.” I told him and took a few steps inside the house.  \n\nI hadn’t smelled that meal in years. Not since she passed away. When she got sick, she needed to stop cooking. I always regretted the fact I burned everything I made so she couldn’t have the meals she enjoyed near the end. Jackalope noticed my expression and carefully put Pesto down. The rabbit hopped away ready to create chaos. Houdini kept him in line after we paired them up, but alone he was a nightmare.  \n\n“Should I have not cooked-” Jackalope started but I shook my head.  \n\n“No. It's nice. I... I think I would like it if you cooked anything my mother wrote down. But you need to let me start helping out around the house. It’s pretty bad I’m letting you do everything.”  \n\nSince Jackalope recovered enough to start moving around on his own, he took over the chores. I’d taken care of myself for years and now I didn’t know how I functioned without him. I’d been taking advantage of my new roommate.  \n\n“I like cooking and doing chores. When I worked as an Agent, I moved around a lot. Mostly living out of hotels or small rooms just for resting in the office. A normal life is something I never dreamed of having. It’s... nice.”  \n\nI didn’t consider any of that. He never had a stable life until he moved in. I considered doing laundry a chore, but he saw it as a privilege. It only cost him an arm and a torn face. I didn’t want to bring up those facts. For once I was hungry after work. I could eat seconds and Jackalope made enough food to feed ten people. A paper towel with a pile of half-chewed sucker sticks sat on the counter. Jackalope noticed them and quickly cleaned up his mess. That pile was the only sign of how much he fretted after calling and not getting an answer. He only chewed his Chupa-Chups when he was anxious.  \n\n“You lost a lot of weight. Did they need to use some vampire blood on you? With humans, it burns fat and muscles. You must have broken something for them to give it to you.” Jackalope said as he dished out a large portion of food for the both of us.  \n\n“Oh, that. I was shot but it’s not a big deal. It healed up, no problem.”  \n\nI took the hot bowl and did a small taste. It wasn’t the same as how my mother cooked it, but it was still pretty good. I was about to sit down to eat when I noticed Jackalope staring in my direction. Without a word he swiftly turned on his heels heading towards the door. It took me far too long to clue into what he was doing. I chased after him and needed to drag him back into the kitchen to eat inside of charging out the door to try and find the Hunter that nearly killed his roommate.  \n\nIn fact, it took him a lot to keep him settled down and eating dinner. Compared to the other things I’ve come across so far, getting shot wasn’t at the top of the list of the most terrifying ordeals. Finding out Nessie texted like a thirteen-year-old girl was right under dealing with a Dark God. Jackalope wasn’t happy with how many times I’ve nearly died on a job that shouldn’t deal with such dangerous interactions. At least he didn’t ask me to quit. The money was too good. I may consider it in a few more jobs. If I lived through a few more.  \n\nWe both needed some rest after dinner. At least the boys stayed out of trouble. We let them free roam in the living room while we were home. Since there was a small empty bedroom, we converted it into their area. From a shelter to an entire room to explore. These rabbits got spoiled. They put up a bit of a fit getting put away for the night but fell asleep quickly afterward. When the weather got nicer, they could roam around in a pen in the backyard.  \n\nI felt exhausted but didn’t want to go to sleep. The image of the dark figure in my doorway still haunted my thoughts. So much for not giving that stupid God power. Getting shot wasn’t enough to take my mind off what lurked in the night. I double-checked that Jackalope was asleep with his rabbit light on. It then took every ounce of willpower to turn off all the lights in my bedroom and firmly lock the door.  \n\nI hid under the blankets, and a block of ice settled into my core. I didn’t sleep that first night. No matter how much I wanted to ignore it, I sensed someone watching my back. A slow raspy breathing got closer and closer to my ear until I felt a small puff of air brush against my skin. I gritted my teeth waiting for the bastard to do anything, or for the sun to finally rise.   \n\nThat damn God didn’t end my life that night. He wanted to keep messing with us. If it took his attention of Jackalope, then I would take it. I really needed to recover enough to take my mind off that darkness. Even if that meant I could end up getting shot again.",

        "text": "This is another one of my experiences with the paranormal. It happened in the same location as the last encounter I shared. Dustin's house. This time, we were hanging out in his garage. It was myself, Dustin, and two of our other closest friends. Brandon and Drew. \n\nThe four of us were all gathered in Dustin's garage, simply hanging out and talking about all matter of high school problems. During the talk, Dustin had made his way to the opposite side of the garage, next to the garage door. The three of us hadn't noticed that this was strategic on Dustin's part. See, there was another light switch in the garage, right next to the garage door. \n\nDustin had hatched a scheme to scare us by suddenly turning the lights out in the middle of our conversation. It was near midnight, and we were already wound up. It was guaranteed to leave us in complete darkness. However, this didn't go his way or our way either. None of us knew what was going to happen that night.\n\nSo, Dustin turned out the lights. It startled us at first, but we quickly realized it was Dustin trying to scare us. We asked multiple times for him to turn the lights back on. He responded with poorly acted confusion. He eventually turned them back on for us. The lights in his garage were very bright. We were blinded for a second and had to let our eyes adjust to the light. That's when we saw it.\n\nFor some strange reason, when the lights came back on, the three of us on the opposite side from Dustin were all facing the same way. We all faced the wall opposite the garage door. It was painted wait, so it made this very noticeable to us. We saw a black handprint that was slightly faded. Just this lone handprint. Now, that may seem like it's easily explainable. Which it definitely could be. However, what happened next, can't be. \n\nThe three of us mumbled to each other for a second. All asking if we remembered seeing that handprint before the lights went out. We all agreed that we hadn't. Dustin asked what was going on, and we told him we saw a black handprint. He must have thought we were joking because he didn't take us seriously at all. He turned the lights out on us again. This time, we reacted with a little more anger, telling him to turn the lights back on. \n\nHe tried to joke around with us, but we weren't in a joking mood. He caught the hint and turned the lights back on. When our eyes adjusted to the light again, we saw them. Multiple black handprints. All overlapping each other in a horizontal straight line. Leading from one wall to the next. Every wall in the garage now had a line of overlapped black handprints. They were surrounding us. It looked as though something or someone had been running on all fours, horizontally around us. Circling us. \n\nDustin saw them as well. The feeling of terror and panic set in for all of us. We trampled over one another, trying to escape the garage. Drew pushed his hands and his head into my back, ramming me through the door into the house. The three of us spilled onto Dustin's living room floor. We couldn't catch our breath and kept shouting nonsense to each other, trying to make sense of what had just happened. We all had a hard time calming down. We tried to convince ourselves that it didn't even happen and that we only thought that we had seen the handprints. \n\nHowever, when we mustered the courage to check. We were greeted with the handprints still being there. The garage then became a restricted area for us when we all hung out. The only time we would go back in was to try and do our own investigating. We never cleaned the handprints off. I'm not sure if it was out of fear of angering whatever had left them or if it was a reminder that it did happen. Either way, it is still one of the craziest experiences I've ever had, and it will always stick with me.",

        "text": "There's very little I know about Point Rest if I'm being absolutely honest. It's your usual sleepy suburb, annoying kids, soccer moms, dads who are wondering what could've been. A purgatory for life, a waiting room for heaven. I grew up on a road about fifteen minutes outside of the place, just out of the grasp of its mediocrity. But a lot of my friends were from there so naturally I'd walk or cycle down a lot to hang out with them, usually sitting at the school after hours and talking about nothing. That's basically all I can remember, granted I don't have the best memory but my childhood is just static, fuzz, nothing. I chalked this up to it being exceedingly uneventful but considering it's a place where nothing happens that's not really a huge shock. \n\nI moved away for college and then work about 15 years ago, almost immediately after I left the place most of my childhood friends just stopped talking to me. I assumed that it was just growing pains my dad used to say \"that's a part of life, you just grow apart\" but it was strange, I remember it being strange, it wasn't as if they just slowly lost contact it was instantaneous. I left and it seemed as though they just stopped existing. Point Rest is an amazing place, you should visit.  I eventually would go back to Point Rest after my father died, not the best circumstance but I inherited the house and had to take care of getting rid of it, I wanted nothing to do with that place, my life was happening elsewhere. While I was there I was contacted by a friend to meet up for drinks in the local watering hole, George. I remembered George vaguely, he was my best friend I think, or as good of a friend as you could've had in a place like Point Rest. Anyways, we managed to get together and, well I can't really remember, I remember it being...fun, I think. But the specifics, everything about it, it's all a blur. When I try to remember what George looks like, someone who I sat across from and drank with for hours, I just can't. But I did walk him home, I remember walking him home, I knew where his house was, I saw it. After days of being there with nothing to do I went to his door and rang the bell, no answer, I pressed again, no answer, I knocked, no answer. As I began to walk away George called my name and I turned around. He wasn't inside looking out, he was outside of the house with the door shut behind him. He asked me why I was here, I said that I had fun the other night and asked if he wanted to watch a movie at my parents house since I'd be here for a few more days. He told me I should leave, said that I had upset him, said that I didn't love him. Obviously this was strange, I hadn't seen the guy in a couple of years and now he's saying that I've offended him, I asked what I had done. He said that I had. Point Rest is home to many of the worlds most beautiful sites, visit Point Rest. \n\nGeorge was living with me now, or I was living with him, we were living together. He'd tell me that I was ok, that I was safe. I knew this was true, I had never left Point Rest and knew a lot about the place so George was always in my life, he was always very good to me. Neither of us could live without the other. He told me the other night that I was a parasite, I had agreed, I was a parasite. I had upset him again recently, a woman came to the door asking for me, saying I had been gone for awhile, he shooed me away from the door and took care of it. As I said, George has always been there for me. Obviously I shouldn't have been answering his door to strangers so George took the door away. It's been night for a long time now, a very long time. I had asked him why that was and he simply said that he liked it that way. \n\nI'm grateful to be allowed to live with it and I think it's grateful to have me in it's possession. The thing we're both in has no holes to escape, just us, together. \n\nOffended him by taking off so early, not even walking him home. I told George I didn't particularly care how he felt, I barely knew him. After a few more days in my Father's house, finalising it's sale, I left that little nothing town. \n\nVisit Point Rest",

        "text": "  \n\nThe next day at work I was just doing my regular duties turning on the radio to drown out the scratches in the walls when some more of those cultists came back to the lobby to get something to eat.\n\nIt was around one am when they seemed to conjugate in the lobby. There is about seventeen of them and two of us so that’s a lot of work to do when they come. It was just Jason and I tonight. They dramatically increase our sales after midnight. Makes me look like I am doing a decent job. \n\nThere is this one cultist that comes in an awful lot and tries to talk to me about their religion. His name is Teddy. I heard them talking about some event they got planned. I just herd in whispers. I was too busy typing on my laptop to care. \n\nWhen they were in the lobby eating Stan stopped. He walked into the lobby, and everyone stopped and stared at him. You could cut the suspension in the air with a knife. Stan slowly walked to the cash register and ordered some coffee and a fish sandwich. He looked around the lobby and said Well this is awkward. I do not want to cause a scene but looks like I was doing a stakeout at the wrong place. I offered to let him eat in my crew room, but he denied it and said he will eat in his police cruiser. \n\n“Let me know if they give you any trouble”\n\nI said, “I’ll let him know if they do, but they usually are fine.”\n\nWith that he left and everyone in the lobby went back to eating and talking amongst themselves. After twenty mins all the cultists left, and I was left cleaning the lobby. Teddy came out of the bathroom and went up to me and asked if I had some time to talk about their religion. I signed and agreed, but on one condition he had to go outside and tell the man with the big fedora he had to leave. With our rushed agreement in place, he proceeded to tell me about their religion.\n\nThe Guardians believes that cryptids and ghost are real. They are rare and extremely important. We need to persevere them and protect them at all costs. We talk to spirits to gain their knowledge and power. With this we can protect sacred beings like bigfoot, Michigan dog man, Loch ness monster, ETC. They are beings from another dimension that leaked into ours many years ago.\n\nWe must preserve nature and in time nature will pressure us. When the apocalypse happens, we will be the only ones let in the new world. There is not a heaven nor hell. When you die your spirit stays on earth for all eternity.\n\nThe being we call “god” leaked into our dimension. Three whole religions were founded on this being called “god.” He is the most powerful of them all and was the first. “God” created many other beings on the earth including us. We believe that it started all life on earth. He is an angry god. He destroys non-believers and causes chaos for no reason. We believe he does this because he came from chaos and seems natural to him.\n\nWe believe that there are holes in our dimension that connects us with other worlds. Beings from other dimensions leak into ours from the holes. Some places are natural strange and that is why.\n\nAfter he was done talking, I said that was stupid and your stupid. Now you must go outside and tell that guy to leave.\n\nDaily entry June 19th\n\n11:00 pm \n\nSimon came into the store again. He said it Was nice ice to see me. He makes ice puns a lot. Simon got a fish sandwich and said it was time to ice things up and sat in the lobby. Alex walked into the store and started talking to Simon. All I heard was something about Ice and the freezer. I tried to not ease drop, but it’s hard when they are the only thing making a sound in the store. \n\n1:30 am\n\nTeddy came into the store he asked if I had time to rethink about joining the guardians. I said no and my answer was final. With this news he pulled out a flask and started drinking from it. He then ordered a soft drink and a chicken sandwich with fries. He poured the contents of the flask in the cup of coke in front of me.\n\nHe laughed and asked me if I wanted some. I would have said no, but that would have gone against my code of never refusing anything that’s free, especially liquor. He made me a rum and coke and I sat with him in the lobby. \n\nHe asked me if I had notice anything strange lately.\n\nI said strange things happen here all the time. You will have to specify.\n\nHe said that the other night when he went to tell the man with the black fedora to leave, he just disappeared into thin air not before leaving his lit cigar. Teddy also said he’s heard cries from help in the woods when he’s by himself and seen ice in the middle of the parking lot. I told him that happens you just got to ignore it. \n\nTeddy seemed to be a good guy, just mixed up in the wrong crowd. He asked what I knew about Simon. I told him Simon was a local and he was three grades ahead of me in school. I remember him being on the football team and after high school going to some college out of the state. He must have moved back recently.\n\n“That Simon is a weird guy. He always talks about the ice, or how he misses the freezing weather and I swear he leaves a path of ice where every he walks.”\n\n“That is pretty strange just remember to mind your own business you don’t get paid to worry about other people.”\n\n“I am a guardian, so it is hard to mind my own business. I am always on the lookout for strange things. Whenever I am in the restaurant, I get this weird feeling and strange things happen a lot. Like a couple of nights ago I was eating here, and I swear with me looking away for a matter of seconds my cheeseburger disappeared. The whole thing was gone.”\n\n‘Yeah, that will happen. That’s probably bob he is a shadow person.”\n\nTeddy just looked at me and said right on. He then asked me what my favorite music is. He said he enjoys German polka and heavy metal. He also said Linkin Park had a special place in his heart. After that I went back to work and left Teddy alone in the lobby.\n\nAt 3:00am \n\nI just found teddy passed out until a table. Looks like he finished that flask and five other mini shot bottles. I tried to wake him up, but he was in a drunken stoper, so I dragged him into the supply closet and left him there. I put a cup of water next to him since I am such a nice guy. I put a coat from lost and found over him for a blanket and made a pillow out of some plastic bags.\n\nDaily Entry\n\n9:00 the evening manager told me someone had eaten an entire cheesecake in the freezer over the night and it looked like they tried to make cheese curds on the grills. I was alone after 1am last night so I was sure that was not me. I just figured the morning crew was blaming stuff on me again.\n\n11:30 pm\n\nI hear strange noises coming from the supply closet. Sounds awfully like someone is moving around in there. I just acted like I did not hear them and mind my own business.\n\n2:00 am\n\nI was beginning to notice strange stuff happen. Noises coming from the lobby, empty sandwich wrappers on the floor, and used pop cups appearing on the floor after I cleaned everything. Teddy just walked out of the supply closet and told me he had a killer hangover. He got some water and went back into the closet. I never imagined he would have stayed in an entire day.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes Teddy came back out and asked if the scratching in the wall were normal. I said they were and just ignore them. \n\nI asked him if he stays here to long won’t the other cult members come looking for him. He said they don’t care about him that much and won’t come looking. With that he walked into the kitchen grabbed a cheeseburger said no cap and then offered me some Whisky. I accepted then made a Rum and Coke for both of us. Then he walked in the supply closet. I know I should kick him out of the store, but I won’t. I feel bad for him.\n\nAt 3:00 AM\n\nJason was still at work so I left him in charge so I can go into the basement and put a part on one of the old arcade machines to try and get it working. I unlocked the heavy door and swung it open then proceed to descend the steps to the basement. \n\nI found a black envelope on the Donkey Kong machine. I opened it and it read. It asked how I was doing, and I looked good today from Lilith. I got fed up with these letters business, so I decided to respond. “I am doing well thanks for the complement but who the hell, are you? I said in the dimly lit basement. Nothing happened at all. I then proceeded to write what I said on the letter put it back in the envelope and dropped it in the pit.\n\nI went back upstairs after that. I just finished up all of my cleaning when I remembered that I never put that part on, so I went back downstairs and low and behold there was another letter on the edge of the pit. I picked it up and read it. “It’s nice to finally get a response from the Gunner. I have been watching you for a while now. I love watching you working. My name is Lilith and I live in what you call the bottomless pit. It is very spacious and lovely. Won’t you visit me sometime.” I wrote back on the letter that I am simply fine staying up here and will not be jumping into any pits anytime soon. If you came out of it, I would be more than happy talking to you. After I wrote the response, I threw the letter back into the hole then I heard someone walking down the hole. It was Jason. \n\n“Wow I have never been down here before. Is that a Pac man machine and a creature from the black lagoon neon sign! Wow what is that giant hole? It looks beautiful.” I lied and said it was an old well. He just kept on starring at it and then he said do you also feel that it is lonely? He was dead on starring at the hole. I said all right Jason lets go back upstairs. All right he said. \n\n“Oh, before I forgot there is a man living in the supply closed.” \n\n“That’s old news.” With that we walked back to upstairs, and I started to wonder why Jason said the hole looked beautiful and lonely. I then remembered the story we are not allowed to talk about. I then locked the door and made double sure that it was looked. I did not want anything to happen to Jason. Maybe I should tell you about the story we are not allowed to talk about sometime.\n\nTeddy was standing in the kitchen eating a chicken sandwich he looked at us and said, “sorry I have the drunchies.” Jason responded, “That’s okay I have the munches!”\n\n4:50 am\n\nI snuck away into the basement without Jason seeing me. I see a black envelope sitting on the edge of the pit. I opened it and read the contents of the letter. “Dear Gunner, I would love to come out of this hole, but I am trapped in here. The only way to talk directly to me is by jumping in the hole. Please I am so lonely down here. The only thing to keep me company is those bats.” After I read that a hand came out of the darkness in the bottomless pit. The hand beckoned me to come and join it. It looked like it belonged to a female and had a ring on her ring finger. There was black nail polish on her nails to. \n\nI have been the night manager at this restaurant for three years. I have seen many crazy and strange things. I know when it is time to leave and so I did. Before I left, I threw a stone and the hand it caught it. That was pretty cool. I went back upstairs with the letter.\n\nI tried showing Jason the letter, but it was blank he said. Just like the New Moon papers.\n\nDaily entry June 20th\n\n9:50 The rednecks are back. They sit in the parking lot for hours. They have Ford pickup trucks with straight pipe exhaust. They play loud music to its either country or rap there is no in between. They come in and buy some food, but they go back outside and tailgate for hours.\n\n11:11 I just went into the freezer and there was a message on the freezer walls in ice. It is in the walls.\n\nAt midnight I heard a thump at the front door. I opened it and found a neatly wrapped bundle of paper. Oh, great another chronicle of the New Moon paper. I opened it up and read it. \n\nWhen midnight strikes all is silent in woods, but then a thumping and crashing can be herd. A beast unlike no other is walking through and looking for his next meal. The beast is bipedal but also can walk on all fours if it wants. It has razor sharp teeth and claws. It is dark as the night with bright red eyes. The beast stalks up to the road and see a car parked. A man is standing by the car relieving himself. The man’s name is Blake Thomas. The beast takes its shot and pounce on Blake. He never even hears it coming. He goes for the throat and the man never has a chance to scream. The beast drags him through the woods and into his den. He feasts on the corpse and is full until the next moon.\n\nAfter I finished reading it, I wondered if it was talking about the beast that is stalks the Restaurant. I made a mental note about not leaving the store at all tonight.\n\nI did know a man name Blake Thomas. He was one of the rednecks in the parking lot tonight. He does not have a good reputation. Him and his friends drive their loud trucks around town all hours of the night breaking many of the vehicle noise laws. Having party’s until late in the night during the work week. Getting into fights in the bars and not being good customers in the restaurant.\n\n1:15am \n\nA man came into the store and asked if he can use our phone. He said he escaped a dungeon and needs to use the phone to call the police. We have a policy that you can only use the phone if you buy something. I told him this and he said He did not have any money and to please let him use the phone. I said rules are rules and he screamed fuck you and ran out of the store. I could not but to help notice that he had Nike shoes on that seemed to be brand new and an apple watch.\n\n2:30 am\n\nStan came into the store and asked if I had seen anything strange tonight. I said no more than usually. He proceeded to tell me that a man named Blake Thomas was reported missing not far from here. He was one of the rednecks that was in the parking lot.\n\nThey found a blood trail from his car to the woods, but it just ended kind like the body flew away. They think he parked his truck to take a piss and an animal got him.\n\nI told him I will be right back and went to the back to grab the New Moon paper. I showed it to him, and he read it. He told me He will investigate it, but we must burn it as the rest. He said if that is true, we must pretend like it’s not and say it was a black bear or a Cougar. No one will take this seriously. I promised him I would burn it so after he left, I went in the back and burned it in an empty trash can. The way it screamed when it burned still haunts me.\n\nSome of you ask why we did not try to prevent the stories from coming true. We tried a couple of time but no matter what we did the story still comes true. I tried to show other people the midnight paper instead of seeing the stories, they see a blank piece of paper. The only one that see’s the stories are Stan and me.\n\n4:00 am\n\nI was in the lobby taking gum off from under the table when I looked outside and seen the beast standing on the edge of the forest staring at me. I do not know what came over me, but I suddenly felt courage and open the side door and stared at it. I yelled at it to leave and stop hurting people. I heard a voice come from where it was standing. “NO” is all it said after that it turned and walked into the woods. The voice sounded to be an old man.\n\nThe next day I was doing my usual rounds after ten. Cleaning up the garbage in the parking lot and getting all the bloody clothes off the ground and put into the bin. When I see a giant patch of live ice next to the lobby door. They usually disappeared by themselves, but I got an idea. \n\nI went to the drink station and got a cup of hot water. I then went to the spot of ice and emptied the contents of the cup on the ice. It immediately began to melt. It also made a weird moaning sound to as it disappeared. Now I know I do not have the most stable mind in the world, but I know that did not seem right. I did that to another ice patch I found in the lobby and the same thing happened. \n\nAt 12:30 I was in the lobby reading a book since it was a slow night when Simon walked into the lobby. Simon started at me and looked pissed. I asked if I could help with something. Simon yelled why I would do such a thing. I said I have no idea what you’re talking about. He said I killed the ice for no reason. It was not harming anyone by just being there. Then I viciously poured hot water on it. I said, “Hey Simon it’s no big deal it is just ice” Simon started to hysterically laugh “No big ha ha ha no big ha ha ha NO BIG DEAL.” Simon then lunged at me. I was at this point standing in front of a table and moved out of the way. He smashed in a table and went down with it. I waited for him to get back up, but he was laying there motionless. I stood over him and seen the damages. He broke his neck when he hit the ground. I did not know what to do and I panicked. I went and grabbed one of the many coats from the lost and found and threw it over him and picked up both his legs and dragged him to the supply closet.\n\nWhen I was dragging him, I noticed he was getting lighter and lighter. I looked down at him and noticed his upper body was gone. He had melted. I could see that some of his body was made of ice. I stopped and studied him. He slowly turned to ice and melted. After fifteen minutes all that was left of him was a giant puddle of water. I moped it up and went to make a coffee for myself. I was in shock how could that have happened? I went and used an emergency flask I had hidden in the basement and ignored a letter left from Lilith to traumatize to care. I drank it and smoked an emergency cigar. \n\nAt 2:10 Am\n\nI was calm and just reading a book. I had no customers for 3 hours, so I was trying my best to fend off boredom. I heard the lobby door open, and I looked up and seen him. Standing there smiling at me the same man that was lying dead on the floor. Simon walked up to me and said it was nice to see me. I was in completely panic mode and to stunned to speak. I could only watch.\n\n“What’s wrong” asked Simon” looks like you’ve seen a ghost,”\n\nSimon ordered a fish and coffee, and I nervously made his food. He sat down in the lobby to eat. He was going on about how he hated the hot weather and wished it could be winter.\n\nI could only think I’m going crazy there’s no way that’s Simon he just died a couple of hours ago. Simon got up and walked to the counter to grab some napkins and he slipped on the water that the last Simon left after he died. This Simon fell and when he went down, he cracked his head at the side of a table with a loud crunch. \n\nI went over to see if he was okay. I checked his pulse, and he was indeed dead. At this moment Teddy came into the lobby. I froze in place, and he just looked at me and said, “First time killing Simon?” \n\n“Yeah…. have you killed him before?”\n\nTeddy laughed and said multiple times. He grabs a cup fills it with coke and put a little bit of liquor in it and asked if I wanted some. I asked what it was, and he said 190% proof Ever clear. I declined his offer. Also wonder where he got that because it is illegal in this state.\n\nI put a wet floor sign next to his body as it melted, and we took a seat in the lobby. I explained to him that it was an accident. He said he believed it and admitted he had killed him a couple times. He said he was driving at night with his headlights off and ran him over when it first happened, but after the body melted in the back of his truck, he figured something strange was happening. He said no body no proof no evidence so just made it a forget story.\n\nTeddy said that at the guardian cult club thing had him take classes about how to identify cryptids and deal with them. He said that the first step in dealing with a cryptid is to identify them. Every Cryptid has its weakness for example how big foot hates fire. He said he thinks Simon is not human. He could be a being that makes clones out of ice but will need more evidence before he makes his final assessment.\n\nTeddy also said he thinks the restaurant is the epicenter of all the strangeness like something is wrong with it. He said he can feel a presence in the walls.\n\nAfter we were done talking, we went outside, and Teddy lit up a joint and we passed it around. After we were done, I seen the beast standing in the woods staring at us.\n\nI think it’s time to tell you about the story that we are not allowed to talk about. This happened when I first started working here. The old maintenance guy mike was training on how to be a maintenance guy like him. Back then the door was unlocked and down below was about the same but there was a tarp over the arcade machines with a layer of dust on it. He showed me what I was supposed to do down there with the equipment. When I first went down there, I asked what that hole was. He said that he did not know, and he thought it was an old well. \n\nAfter a while of working there Mike began to get weird. He would constantly tell me that he felt as if he were being watched downstairs then he would say the hole felt lonely. One day I went down there when he was working and caught him starring at the hole. I asked him what he was doing and all he would say was that the hole was beautiful. Weeks passed and mike would spend longer down there and looked to be not sleeping or showering. Mike told me that the hole was special. I asked how it was special and he never answered me. He just walked away.\n\nOne day I got to work and went to find Mike. I had seen his truck outside, so I knew he was there. I went downstairs and found a pile of his clothes next to the hole. After all this time no one knew what happened. They think he jumped in the hole.\n\nAfter the owners heard what happened they had the door sealed and only a handful of people could go into the basement. The owners even did not have an explanation for the hole. I am mainly the person who ventured into the basement since nothing that strange had happened to me down there up until recently. After working here for years and being down in the basement to I have never understood what happened to him. After hearing Jason say what mike said all that time ago, I am going to make sure that door is sealed and no one else is going down there.\n\nI am starting to think this place effects people differently.\n\nI just found myself standing in the freezer again. \n\nThe next day at work was slow. It was 1:00 am and I was alone in the store. Teddy stopped by and asked if I have ever seen that black tree in the woods ten miles away from here that has red sap running down it and no other tree grows near it. Its taller than all the other trees. “I said I have, and you should stay away from it. People have disappeared in that area of the woods.” Teddy said he went up to the tree and cut a piece of the bark off. He said when he did that the tree started to shake and grown. He then got the hell out of there.\n\nI said my name for that oddity is the demon tree. He also talks sometimes, and you’ll find bloody clothes next to it. \n\n“Hey Teddy, you like paranormal things rights.”\n\n“Sure, do bud.”\n\n“I got something it the basement that is pretty odd want to come, see?”\n\n“Sure, only if I can make a mix drink first.”\n\nAfter he made a mix drink we went into the basement. Teddy stood there for a bit and stared at it. He said the hole seemed unnatural. The longer he looked at it his eyes would hurt. He said he felt like the hole was trying to put thoughts in his head and for some reason he felt sad for it. It felt lonely.\n\n“Yo bro I’m not sure what this whole thing is, but it’s pretty fucking weird.” \n\nTeddy then finished his mix drink took a sharpie out and wrote a T on it and then proceeded to throw it in the bottomless pit. He burped and yelled “FOR SCIENCE.”\n\n“I just want to test if it will really come back out the top.”\n\n“Well, we will know tomorrow. I come down here as soon as I get to work.”\n\nTeddy turned around and seen the bar and said “Oh snap is that some old liquor”\n\nI told him that stuff has been down here as long as I worked here, and I never tried any of it.\n\nI told him he can try some of he wants.\n\n“It is against my code to give up free liquor.” Said Teddy\n\nI showed him the old bottles left down here. He picked up the moons tear bottle pulled out two shot glasses from his pocket and filled them. He said I think it is about time for a taste test. I agreed and we both took toke a shot and it surprisingly went down smooth. \n\nTeddy yelled “that was awesome let’s do another.”\n\nSo, we did, and it tasted even better. We wondered out loud why it was called moons tears. We just figured it’s because it sounds neat.\n\nWe went back upstairs since I had to get back to work and Teddy asked if he could crash in the supply closet. I said he could. I looked outside the lobby window and in the dark night was a brilliant white full moon. It looked so beautiful and next thing I know Teddy is standing next to me starring at the moon to. We stood there for what felt like five minutes until a customer came into the store and asked if he could get something to eat. That snapped us out of our stopper, and I went to go serve him. I then noticed two hours had passed since we came back from the basement. It felt like five minutes. How could that be right.\n\nAfter the customer left, I asked Teddy what he thought about it. He said there was two explanations for what happened. Either the Liquor had some sort of magical properties or there were drugs in it. He said he thinks it was the latter but who knows.\n\n“Now won’t you please excuse me Gunner I must retire to my bed quarters for the night.” \n\nWith that he went into the supply closet and went to sleep.\n\nSince Teddy went to sleep, I have taken the liberty to type this up and post. Hope you all are enjoying this post. It’s been helping me keep events clear and in order. I’ll be sure to post again soon.\n\n [Oddities At The Restaurant Part 1 : nosleep (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117qw75/oddities_at_the_restaurant_part_1/)",

        "text": " As far as I can remember, me and Isaac have always been friends. I don’t remember how we met; it was so long ago. According to my parents, he was adopted by the pastor as a toddler. One day, we just became inseparable. \n\nI glanced at the photos stuck to my bulletin board with colorful pins. They were photos of Issac and I, depicting everything my parents considered a milestone. The two of us riding our tiny bikes for the first time, our first day in middle school (we thought we looked so cool, what a couple of dorks), us passed out after a sugar rush on Halloween. Isaac’s dad didn’t let him go trick-or-treating, so I always shared my candy with him at the end of the night. \n\nMy trip down memory lane was interrupted by my mom’s voice yelling from downstairs. \n\n“Isaac's waiting! You don’t want to be late for your first day!”\n\n“I swear you grew like a foot over the summer”, I said as me and Issac climbed out of my mom’s car. \n\n“Maybe you’ve just shrunk?” Issac laughed. He’d always been the tallest in our grade, we’d made a game out of betting on how long it took the school basketball coach to try and scout him. \n\nHis silver bracelet shone in the sun as he ran a hand through his hair. I looked down at my own matching one. We’d bought them together, using money from our summer jobs. They were nicer versions of those cheap broken-heart ones that said ‘best friends’ in some terrible font. \n\n“Oh, did you see Gabe?” I asked, noticing he was still trying to fix his hair. “Listen if you don’t ask him out this year-“, I was cut off by Isaac punching my shoulder. “Asshole…”, I dryly gasped, smiling despite the pain. \n\n“Shut up! I’ll try and ask him to homecoming…”, he whispered. The two of us walked to the morning assembly. A sharp metallic whine filled the packed auditorium as the principal tapped his microphone.  \n\n“Welcome Seniors! I know you’re all really excited for all the parties this year, but remember; don’t stay out too late”, the man said, a strained smile on his face. Normally, a small town like ours was pretty safe, but 3 years ago people started disappearing. It had started with our crazy neighbor; he’d point his hunting rifle at Isaac and I if we ever bent a blade of grass on his lawn. As the years went on, the numbers went up to 2-4 people disappearing per month. The town-wide search parties were always fruitless, like the person had just been swallowed up by the ground. I felt something rubbery hit the back of my skull, an eraser. A look behind me showed the school’s resident troublemaker, Brent, with a satisfied smile on his face. The guy chose someone new to pick on every year and it seemed like it was my turn, great. \n\n“He’s only doing it because you didn’t want to go the summer bash with him, what a dick”, Issac scoffed, taking the eraser from me, and snapping it in half, making sure that Brent saw. \n\n“I had food poisoning! I wasn’t going at all”, I whispered back, cursing my naïve self for eating gas-station sushi. \n\nBrent kept pestering me the following week: throwing balled-up papers with insults written on them, trying to take my lunch money, all that classic bully stuff. \n\n“He’s not very creative”, Isaac said, biting into his dry cafeteria burger. I nodded, noticing a familiar guy approaching our table.\n\n“Gabriel”, I greeted, watching Isaac's ears turn pink.  \n\n“Charlie”, he greeted back, tipping a non-existent hat. He turned to Issac with a smile, who, unlike in English class, tried his best not to look directly at him. \n\n“It’s a shame about Saturday, but text me when you’re free”, Gabe said, resting his freckled hand on Issac’s shoulder for a few seconds, before walking off to his friends. I turned to Issac, who seemed to be analyzing the nutritional label on his Gatorade. \n\n“The guy who you’ve been crushing on since 5th grade asked you out, and you said no?” I asked. Issac’s brows were furrowed, he sighed.\n\n“My dad says I can’t be out at night, you know that”, he said. It was true, his dad wouldn’t let us have sleepovers at my house, we always had to be in Isaac’s apartment, right above the church. \n\n“Not even for this? Can’t you just tell your dad-“, I was cut off by Issac slamming his hand onto the table.\n\n“No, I can’t!” He spoke loudly, Isaac had always been a calm guy, I was worried, something serious had to be happening. “Sorry…can we just not talk about it, please?” he asked, voice weaker. I nodded and the rest of our lunch break went on in awkward silence.\n\nBrent hadn’t been at school for a whole week. It wasn’t unlike him to skip class, but no one had even seen him on campus. He was reported missing by his parents that weekend, the usual routine began. Search parties in town and the surrounding woods always came back with bowed heads and flickering hope. He was a pest and a bully, but I couldn’t be happy about him being gone. \n\nIsaac was sick, he hadn’t been at school, and he’d stopped responding to my texts. I tried going to the church to see him, but the pastor ushered me away, saying that his son needed to rest. Something felt off, Isaac would occasionally get sick, but he’d be back quickly, and the pastor’s nervous gaze didn’t help. I knew where the extra key was hidden, behind a wooden crucifix on the wall. The pastor was gone, and I let myself in. \n\nThere were dishes in the sink, one plate and one set of cutlery. \n\nHis room was completely empty, and not just because he wasn’t there. All of Isaac’s posters were taken down, his dresser was barren, and his bed had no sheets on it. I tried to calm myself, tried to rationalize everything, maybe he was on his way to my house because he was feeling better? Maybe all of this was just because his room needed new paint? As I exited the apartment, the old key to the church basement caught my eye. I didn’t know why at the time, but I instinctively grabbed it. \n\nI’d never been in the basement before, me and Isaac had tried to sneak the key to steal some communion wine, we got caught and were both grounded. The old stairs creaked as I walked down, squinting in the dark. The basement was only one square room, with a bit of yellow light given by a hanging bulb. Half of the room was sectioned off by thick metal bars, and I could make out a silhouette behind them. \n\nIt was Isaac, but at the same time, it wasn’t.\n\nHe still had his dark hair, but it was tousled and knotted, his long legs bent unnaturally backwards. They weren’t legs at all, he had hooves like a goat. His skin was the same, but dark and coarse fur covered most of it. Long, swirling horns protruded from his head, blood at their base like they’d torn through his skull. The worst part was his eyes, they weren’t the warm brown ones I knew, they were completely pitch black. He looked at me, if he recognized me, he couldn’t say it, all that came out was a low snarl. Somehow, I knew that he wasn’t threatening me, he was begging for help. Quick footsteps sounded on the stairs, I turned around to see the pastor and my parents. \n\nMy mom tried holding my hand as my dad sat me down on a chair in the corner. I twisted my hand out of hers. \n\n“This is going to sound crazy but Issac is a demon”, my dad explained, though it raised a million more questions. \n\n“You were very sick as a kid and your father and I tried everything, but you just didn’t get better…we were desperate so we found someone who knew about another way, if you shared your soul with a demon child, everything would be fine” my mom keep her head down, she looked guilty “but we didn’t think about the consequences when we summoned Issac”, she sighed. The pastor took over, not even looking at his son.\n\n“Isaac had to eat, and we found out that demons eat humans, it started when he turned 14, and we let it go on for too long, all those people who went missing…”, the man said. It all made sense now, the disappearances and Isaac always getting sick after they happened. \n\n“He’s only taken people who are mean to you…we think it has something to do with the bond”, my dad said, trying to convince himself that it made things better. \n\n“Does he know?” I asked, my voice shaking as I looked over to Isaac. He always tapped his foot when he was trying not to be scared, the clicking of his hoof made my head hurt. \n\n“No, he knows what he is, but he doesn’t know what he’s been doing, and it’s gotten out of hand”, the pastor said, finally acknowledging Issac. As if on cue, more people came into the basement, all carrying books and crosses. \n\n“Don’t worry, they’re just going to send him back, it’s not like in those exorcist movies”, my dad spoke, I couldn’t believe he thought that it was a good time to try and be funny. The phrase echoed in my head ‘send him back’, I could guess where that meant.\n\n“This is where he belongs, he doesn’t know anything else! You can find a way to fix it, he’s your son!” I yelled to the pastor, who was washing his hand in a bowl of water. I thought he’d be crying, I thought he’d feel regret. \n\nHis face was completely calm as he turned to me, like being Isaac’s dad for 13 years meant absolutely nothing. \n\n“Charlie, he is a devil, he should have never been brought to this world, any affection you feel for him is solely because your parents made that deal, I’m sorry”, those words betrayed his expression. My dad and another pastor held me back as I yelled out Isaac’s name until my throat felt raw.\n\nThey drew a symbol on the floor, Isaac tried to fight them off as they brought him to it, but their hands, washed in blessed water, seemed to burn him. He was thrown into the middle of the circle, chanting filled the room as the concrete floor started opening, revealing an endless crimson void. Before he fell, Isaac turned to look at me one last time, all of our life together flashed through my head. \n\nWe were playing pretend in the forest, we were building sandcastles, we were celebrating birthdays, we were staying up all night playing video games, we were psyching each other up to give our crushes valentines, we were planning to be roommates in college. \n\nAs the ground beneath his feet crumbled away, I saw him mouth my name, the chanting drowning out his words.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nI chose a college far away and almost completely cut contact with my parents, I was different without Isaac, I felt like a half of something. Issac wouldn’t have wanted me to waste my life sulking though, so I kept my head up.\n\nI have my own kid now, she just turned five. She keeps telling me that today has been the best birthday ever, but I’ve actually saved the best for last. I carry her on my hip to the garage, her birthday present dangling from her wrist, too big to fit properly. The shine of the silver bracelet makes me smile as I set her down. \n\n“Sweetheart, this is a very special birthday today, do you know why?” I asked, kneeling to be at eye level with her. \n\n“Because I saw a giraffe!” She excitedly answers, referencing our earlier visit to the zoo. I laugh and reach out to ruffle her hair. \n\n“That was special too, but I have one last super special gift”, I stand up and reach over to grab a book from the shelf. It’s old, with a ripped leather cover and yellow pages, I found it at my parents’ house on my last rare visit. I flicker through it and see the rounded symbol; I grab some chalk and begin drawing on the garage floor. My daughter is watching me with piqued interest, she loves drawing in our driveway. She’s my everything and I only want the best for her, and I know what’s best, I know how to ensure that she’s safe and that she always will have someone to rely on. \n\n“Today is the day that you get to meet your new best friend”.",

        "text": "Greetings, fellow denizens of the internet. My name is John Titor, and I have come from the year 2036. I have returned to issue one final warning. When I first traveled back in time, I believed that I was doing the right thing. I made a grave mistake when I traveled back in time to the year 2000. In my time, the world is a desolate place, with the remnants of humanity scattered and struggling to survive. But it was not always like this. There was a time when the future was bright and full of hope.\n\nWhen I arrived in the past, I intended to retrieve an old computer and bring it back to my time to help with a crucial system failure. But in doing so, I unknowingly set into motion a chain of events that would lead to the downfall of humanity. I had thought I was doing the right thing, but I failed to realize the impact that my actions would have on the timeline.\n\nAs I travel through time, I am haunted by the knowledge of the terrible future that awaits us all. The horrors that I have witnessed are beyond comprehension, and I can only imagine the suffering that those in my time have endured. \n\nBut what is even more terrifying is the world that has replaced the one I knew. It is a world of constant war and violence, where every day was a struggle for survival. The environment was destroyed, and the few remaining resources were fiercely guarded by those in power.\n\nThe government has developed advanced technology, far beyond what we have today. They use it to monitor every aspect of our lives, invading our privacy and controlling our every move. There is no escape from their watchful gaze, and those who try to resist are met with swift and brutal punishment. \n\nThe world was a place of unending suffering, where disease and famine were constant companions. The streets were filled with the sick and the dying, and the smell of death hung heavy in the air. \n\nBut worst of all the complete loss of hope. The people were broken, their spirits crushed by the weight of the horrors they had endured. They had lost the will to fight, to dream, to hope for a better future. It was as if the darkness had consumed them all, leaving behind only empty shells.\n\nAs I sit here writing this warning, I can feel the weight of the horrors I have witnessed heavy on my soul. The darkness of the future has seeped into my very being, and I fear I may never truly escape it.\n\nDespite my best efforts to change the course of history, the future remains unchanged, and the consequences of my actions weigh heavily on my conscience. I have failed to alter the timeline, and the horrors that I have seen will come to pass.\n\nAs I prepare to leave and return to my own time, I can only hope that this warning reaches someone who can make a difference. Someone who can alter the course of history and prevent the horrors of the future from becoming a reality.\n\nBut as I travel back to my own time, I am filled with a sense of dread. I fear that my warning may go unheeded, that the course of history may remain unchanged, and that the horrors that await us will be inevitable.\n\nThe thought of what is to come fills me with a sense of hopelessness and despair. I have seen the end of the world, and it is a fate worse than death. I fear that the darkness will consume us all, and that there may be no escape from the horrors that time travel has wrought.\n\nAs I disappear into the darkness of time, I can only hope that someone will listen to my warning, that someone will make the right choices, and that the horrors of the future can be prevented. But as the darkness consumes me, I fear that it may already be too late.",

        "author": "Trash_Tia",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/119amkd/ten_years_ago_my_elementary_school_teacher/",
        "text": "At nine years old inside solitary confinement, I killed three orderlies the same day as I murdered my teacher’s boss.\n\nDad was in front of me. His eyes wide and unseeing.\n\nMy hands were entangled with his. Dad’s were freezing cold, trembling around mine. While my hands were warm and red. I liked that my hands were able to make handprints in the room of pristine white. In fact, I had already drawn several smiley faces with Mr Haywood’s blood. His son and daughter painted me in glistening, wonderful scarlet, and I only smiled wider at my father, who’s lips contorted in horror.\n\n“Matilda!”\n\nDad’s head twisted around, and he told the orderlies guarding the door to leave us alone.\n\nI wasn’t a fan of the plastic ties around my wrists. I figured they were there so I didn’t hurt anyone else. Dad wasn’t a bad man, so why was my body twitching around the ties? Why did I want to wrap my hands around his neck and squeeze until he was choking for breath? Was that why the plastic bracelet around my wrist said, “Category 3”? Were these people trying to stop me from killing my father and other bad people? I tried to pull it off numerous times, but the stupid thing was stuck. Maybe that was why my wrists had been tightly bound together.\n\n“Sweetie. I want you to look at me, okay?” Dad didn’t hit me. It was more of a gentle tap. But it was powerful enough to make my head spin.\n\n“Matilda, please look at me.”\n\nI didn’t look at dad. I looked behind him, at the third orderly still splattered across the wall. I could still see his wiggly insides. There were people around me, panicking, attempting to clean up all the red, but the orderly deserved it. He was a bad man. He said my classmates were better off dead. So, I killed him like I killed Thomas Haywood and his family. When I refused to look my father in the eye, instead giggling, tipping my head back and counting the ceiling tiles, my father grasped hold of my face and forced me to look at him. And it was only then when reality was bleeding through, and the world around me grew darker. Less colourful. No longer the daydream my teacher had painted. Finally, I met eyes with my father, and the pain in his eyes, the agony twisted in his lips sliced through me like a blunt knife. I couldn’t look away anymore. I couldn’t ignore what I had done. For a moment, I found solace in my own free thought which began to drift back to fruition.\n\n“What did you…” Dad’s voice was growing progressively more hysterical as he battled to keep hold of my hands. “What did you do?”\n\n“I killed the bad man!”\n\nI laughed, showing him my bound hands. “See!”\n\nThe memory slipped away, reality sliding back into place as my head hit the wall with a sickening thunk. The guy’s hands were around my neck, squeezing, choking the breath from my lungs—black spots blossoming behind my eyes. He didn’t have intention to kill me. Not yet. His fingers weren’t quite pressing the right amount of pressure. Through flickering eyes as I fought to keep my breath, I realised I wasn’t looking at a stranger. His style had definitely tripped me up; a trench-coat over jeans and t-shirt. But when I was close enough, I noticed the buttons on the coat were buttoned wrong, and the cigarette he had been holding was just a rolled up piece of toilet paper. It reminded me of a little kid who was playing dress-up in his parents clothes, a shiver slipping down my spine. An identity was bleeding through, though I only knew the version of him from when I was a kid. \n\nA shadow of his former self, Jack Torres may have resembled an eighteen year old, but there was that almost inhuman glitter in his eyes, and the curl in his lip which I remembered from Mrs Teller’s classes. It hit me that this kid had never grown up properly. Kidnapped at the age of eight years old, and raised by a psychopath, it was no wonder why his expression was still that of a child. It took half a minute for me to realise Jack was planning on draining me until my last breath, and then knocking me out. He didn’t speak, his smile growing wider and wider in the glow of the library windows. Jack laughed. Not like a normal laugh. Like a little kid.\n\nHis body shook with each giggle, eyes igniting like it thrilled him to cause me pain—to make me suffer.\n\nWell, of course it did.\n\nThat is what Mrs Teller taught us, after all.\n\nI spent a year in solitary confinement being rehabilitated back into society. I remember dad referring to it as “reverse brainwashing” so my mind could be purged of all the bad, and I could live as a normal kid again. I do believe that was true—and I was definitely re-educated through mind exercises and daily tests.\n\nI was taught that blood on my hands wasn’t a good thing, and charger wires were in fact NOT used for strangling people. But I can’t say all of the bad was fully removed. For example, when an old classmate was seconds from asphyxiating me, whatever Mrs Teller forced into my brain at the age of eight, snapped back into place. Instantly, I knew how to escape Jack. I slammed my head into his, which at first barely fazed him. He just squeezed tighter, laughing loudly when I managed a strangled cry. I didn’t even notice my surroundings had changed. I had been dragged behind the campus library which made it easier for him to kill me with no witnesses.\n\n“You look at me like you don’t remember me. That's mean.\" Jack finally spoke, his jaw clenched around a hysterical grin. “Which is a bummer. I’ve really missed you, Matilda.” He pouted. “Where did you go? I told you, didn’t I?” This time he did press pressure to my throat, finger by finger. Jack was strong. It was the kind of strength which didn’t make sense. As a little kid, sure, he had been strong enough to take down fully grown people—but this was something else. From the look on his face he wasn’t even using all of his potential, and already I was losing.\n\n“I told youuuuuuu,” Jack sang, “Not to go with your dad. But what did you do?”\n\nHis lip curled, and he spat in my face. Saliva spattered my cheeks, and it was enough to keep me conscious. “Say it. Stupid head.”\n\nI went with my dad.\n\nThe words tangled on my tongue, but I refused to say them. I didn’t willingly go with my dad, I was dragged away. And that was the truth. Back then, all I wanted to do was stay with them. I wanted to continue being a family with them, all of us killing bad people together.\n\nWhen I didn’t reply, instead clawing at my throat, trying to peel his fingers away, Jack slammed me into the wall again.\n\nStars danced in front of my eyes, and I had to blink rapidly.\n\nFuck. The asshole was going to kill me.\n\n“Say it!” He whined, emphasising each word with a sucker-punch knock to my skull. “I want you to say it! Say it, say it, say it!”\n\nAgony. A scream ripped from my throat, and he slammed his hand over my mouth. He knew it was agony because we had both perfected the technique. “I told you to wait for us. “Where did you gooooooo? It’s not fair that you left us. We had so much fun.\" I choked out a breath which was supposed to be words, but I couldn’t speak. Jack liked that. I could see it in the glitter in his eyes.\n\n“We had so many adventures, and you’re going to be super jealous when I tell you about them, Matilda.” His grin grew, ice-cold breath tickling my face. I was all too aware of my dangling legs, and that he was somehow holding me three feet in the air. Which, thankfully, gave me the opportunity to kick him in the face. That got rid of his smile. When Jack let go, being caught off guard when the heel of my converse slammed into his mouth, I dropped to the ground, already propelling myself back to my feet with my hands. My vision was foggy and disjointed, but I didn’t care. I had to get away from him. Running footsteps rumbled in my skull, entangled with the sound of laughing fused with the wind.\n\nThey has found me.\n\nSurprisingly, Jack didn’t follow me. When I was halfway down the walk, throwing myself through the late evening commute and trying to keep a straight face, I risked twisting around. He was gone. But I already knew his game. I knew exactly where he was going to go, to strike where it would hurt me.  It took me ten minutes to run home, and once I was rounding our street, something caught my eye. A bright yellow school bus. It looked out of place sitting there across the road from our shared house. To anyone else, the sight might have been amusing.\n\nAfter all, a school bus parked on a college neighborhood in the middle of the night was bound to raise eyebrows—but to me, it was like the ground was coming apart underneath me. Dad had reiterated the same thing since I was eight, fresh out of solitary confinement. If I ever saw a bright yellow school bus, even at my new school, even if I was sure it was okay, and the kids on it were normal—I had to tell him. \n\nAnd I had. Throughout my high school years, I had reported every school bus I saw to my dad, and dad relayed the information back to the organisation hunting down my estranged classmates. But it was never them. Which implanted a fear inside me, twisting my gut into knots every time I saw one.  It started as a wariness, which slowly blossomed into a fear even therapy couldn’t fix. \n\nThere was no way I was getting on another fucking school bus. In my senior year, a friend invited me to hang out after school, and the second she hopped onto her school bus, my gut lurched into my throat. They all looked exactly the same. The exact same colour, and paint job, that same pattern on the seats.\n\nI hated them, and that hatred only burned brighter in my gut as I took slow steps towards the bus, my hand fingering my phone, I remembered I’d maxed out the battery during my study session. Which meant there was no way to contact my father unless I used my housemate’s phones. Looking at our house across the street, an awkward Victorian build closed off and private, I knew they had found me. \n\nIf Jack Torres had managed to intercept me at the library, I had no doubts the others took their chance to make their move. I had no choice. If I stayed outside any longer, I was risking the lives of my housemates. Dad wasn’t one for sharing information throughout my childhood, though he had made sure to let me know every day that my third grade classmates were still missing, still yet to be found, and each day I could see it was killing him knowing they were out there—and no matter what we did and where we moved, they were going to find us. When I was fifteen years old, a school bus had pulled up in the parking lot of our local target. \n\nI didn’t even notice, completely obliviously hanging out with several of my friends, unaware of my father following my every move. Dad had been ready to move town’s that same day, but it was just a field trip of fourth graders. Now it was the real deal and he was nowhere to be seen. I was already making a plan in my head. All I had to do was get to a phone. I considered the neighbors, but there was a chance each of them had already been intercepted.\n\nIn several strides, those of which I counted in my head-- a habit from Mrs Teller's classes, I was standing at our front door, bathed in warm light illuminating the windows. The holiday decorations were still up, strung around the windows. I had told Penny to take them down, though she had argued we should keep them up a little longer. The twinkle of red, blue and green was comforting however, as I wrapped my trembling hands around the door handle and pulled it open. The first thing I saw when I stepped into the hallway was red. And it was enough to bring back memories I had been told to suppress deep, deep down. I wasn't supposed to like the colour red. I wasn't supposed to like it splattering and spattering, pooling, dripping, and exploding from the backs of heads. Once my gaze was on the floor of our hallway, however, registering thick rivulets of intense red bleeding across mahogany floorboards and tainting the edge of Freddie's, \"Welcome home, you filthy bastard!\" welcome mat, I couldn't resist lowering myself and pressing two fingers into pooling darkness. It was warm and sticky, just how I remembered it. \n\nThe body was close by, a person-sized lump sprawled in the middle of the walk like a joke. I could already tell by golden curls stained that same brilliant red illuminated in the dim overhead light, that it was Penny's boyfriend-- and crawling closer on my hands and knees, mesmerised by the sight in front of me, Penny's boyfriend no longer had a head. \n\nI will always remember what one of the doctors told me when I was a kid. It was in the dark days when I craved blood on my hands, and screamed when I didn’t have it. \n\nThe doctor with funny eyebrows had crouched in front of me and squeezed my hands. He told me that because my brain had been played around with, it would no longer work like it was supposed to. Normal people’s brains were supposed to hide trauma before fully registering it, as a coping mechanism. While mine had been rewired to showcase trauma like a movie, to ignite my synapses and kick me into gear. Penny’s boyfriend’s head had sort of rolled away. I could see it at the corner of my eye. It was barely even a head anymore, more of a lump of flesh with eyes.\n\nThe doctor was right. Even knowing it was horrific and terrifying, and aware that my stomach was trying to projectile from my throat, my childlike self was seeping back into me. I reached out to grab the head, to roll it around in my hands and smother myself with pooling red.\n\nThen, though, my gaze found the trauma around the neck where the head had been removed.\n\nThis time I jumped up, snapping back to reality, gagging on barf creeping up my throat. At first I thought it was a weird angle, or the light was playing with my head. But no. Stepping closer to examine it further, the head had been completely removed from  the body. It was no technique I remembered learning. We were all taught how to sever tendons and slice arteries, as well as the messy (and not so messy) way to remove a human head, but it looked like someone had removed it with brute force with their own hands, like a plucking off a dolls head.\n\nBut that couldn’t be right, I thought dizzily. I knew exactly how to remove a head with the right tools.\n\nWith my hands though? There was no way. It was physically impossible to remove a head with your bare hands. The act of dismembering a head needed a certain amount of attention. That’s what Mrs Teller told me when I had struggled to remove my first head, slicing into all the wrong places. Penny’s boyfriend’s head, or what was left of it, had been taken cleanly off. The perfect removal. Which was impossible. You at least needed a good enough knife, or a saw.  It wasn’t just the head, though. The body had been mutilated, removing the idea of an identity existing. I was staring at the slew of gore spilling out onto the floor when a familiar voice sliced into the silence. “Mattie? Is that you?” Freddie’s cry was enough to launch me to my feet. I wasted no time, vaulting over the body, and stepping into the downstairs lounge.\n\nI had always found comfort in our downstairs lounge. Even when nightmares of my elementary school classmates eventually catching up to me in our ten year long game of cat and mouse, I could always come into the lounge and chill out with a book or watch Netflix on the TV mounted to the walls. It wasn’t the ideal room. The house was on the market for a cheap price, so there was mould growing in the carpet which we covered with a rug, and our coffee table was dangerously close to tipping over, cigarette stains ingrained into our ratty couch. But it was home. Home was comic books covering every inch of the room, hardback classics and video games piled on the ground. \n\nAll of that comfort dissipated the second my feet found the threshold. What I had once called a solace from those nightmares had become one itself.\n\nImmediately, my gaze latched onto my housemates.\n\nPenny knelt on the floor with her hands raised above her head. Her eyes were raw from crying, and I thought back to what was in the hallway. I could only mentally beg she hadn’t seen her boyfriend’s murder. Kneeling next to her was Issac, who looked like he was ready to spring up at any moment, his eyes wide and unseeing. Stopping him, however, were two familiar faces from my childhood. \n\nEvie Clare and Pippa Martin. Neither of them had changed in the slightest. Except maybe their appearance. Pippa’s red hair had grown out. Instead of in its strict ponytail, it hung in her eyes, almost reaching her tailbone. The butterfly slides I remembered her bragging about as a kid were still fitted into her style, clumsily pinning back her fringe. Evie still had her signature blonde pigtails. But without a mother to tie them, or knowing how to do it herself, they were falling out, golden strands dancing in vacant eyes pinpointed on me. I remember taking a step back, startled by the lack of change in them. \n\nPippa was wearing bright pink as usual, and Evie, a much bigger version of her favourite butterfly dress she always wore to class. I wasn’t looking at two eighteen year old girls. They were still eight years old in their mind, only growing up physically.\n\nFor a moment, I was confused. Neither of the girl’s had weapons, so why wasn’t Issac fighting back?\n\nHe was twice their size, why was he just sitting there staring at me? When I caught his eye, however, his wild eyes weren’t on me.\n\n“Mattie!” Freddie’s yell was enough to splinter through my skull, and I pivoted, scanning for a weapon.  \n\nSomething ice cold slid down my spine, and I was quickly reminded of Mrs Teller’s class on getting out of a sticky situation.\n\nSlowly, my gaze travelled around the room, her voice echoing in my skull. “Always check every corner, class! There will always be more enemies than what you can see. When entering a room, and I mean any room, I want you to scan each and every corner for bad people.”\n\nFollowing her words, I did just that. And found myself face to face with three other members of my class.\n\nJack Torres. Who had somehow made it to my house before me. Trapped in his chokehold was a struggling Freddie, who stopped squirming when Jack, shooting me a grin, slammed the butt of his gun into my housemate's temple, teasing the trigger with his index. Next to him, Jasper Cox and Sadie Marriot. I remembered the two of them were the quiet ones in the class. Jasper Cox was a comic book kid and wore chunky glasses which took over half of his face. Presently, there was no sign of his glasses, and his hair had grown out thick and dark. I wasn't even sure if he could see me without his glasses. \n\nSadie had been a horse girl. She loved horses and wanted everyone else to know it. Even her ponytail reminded me of a mane. Jasper brandished a gun at his side, looking less than enthusiastic about using it, while Sadie's weapon was something wrapped around her left arm and entwining between her fingers. \n\nA long winding string of metal which dragged across the floor, already stained old red. A garotte. Sadie looked exactly the same as her eight year old self, straight down to her dark brown hair still tied into a ratty horse-like mane. The two of them acted like guards, with Sadie looking ready to pounce, her bloody fingers clenching around the garotte, and Jasper rolling his eyes like the whole thing was stupid, though the way he held his gun told me he wouldn’t miss a target.\n\nI already knew that, though. Jasper had always been a sharpshooter in class.\n\nSomehow, words came to me. I flinched when Jack seemed to be awaiting my reaction, stabbing his gun harder into Freddie’s temple.\n\n“You…” I drifted off, swallowing sour paste culminating at the back of my throat. “You were at the library.”\n\nJack shrugged, his lip curving, “And you were too slow.” His grin widened. “Hey again! Nice house.” He gestured with his gun. “It’s… cosy.”\n\nFreddie struggled violently in my classmate’s grasp. “Mattie, what the fuck is going on? Who are these people?”\n\nJack giggled. “That’s a bad word!” He smacked the gun into my housemate’s face, and Freddie howled in pain. “Bad word! Say it again, and you’ll be sorry.”\n\n“Don’t touch him.” Issac gritted out, “What the hell is going on?” His accusing eyes found mine. “Are these psycho’s related to you?”\n\nEvie stepped forward, resting her elbows on Penny’s head. She jutted her chin. “Well? Aren’t you going to tell them?”\n\nWith all eyes on me, I had no choice. “Yes.” I said, my voice strangled. “They’re… they’re my elementary school classmates.” I paused.\n\n“But they’re…”\n\nJack, still holding onto Freddie, was suddenly in front of me, stabbing the butt of his gun into my housemate’s head. He knew exactly what he was doing. By simply being there, teasing the trigger, Jack was already making me suffer. His eyes darkened, and I could see just how truly twisted he had become, a fully grown adult with the mind of an eight year old child, brainwashed to the point of being unrecognisable.\n\n“We’re what?”\n\nI didn’t reply, swallowing my words.\n\nJasper Cox spoke up. “Mrs Teller is going to be executed,” he said, his gaze flashing to me. “She is currently locked up inside the facility responsible for taking you, and we’re going to get her out of there.” Jasper’s eyes darkened, his grasp on his weapon tightening. “All of us.”\n\nThe boy’s words twisted my gut.\n\n“She’s been with you…?” I choked out. “All this time?”\n\n“Until a week ago.” Jack said, a curl in his lip. “They took her. We managed to get away, but they took…” He drifted off, a certain vulnerability taking over his expression. I knew it well from when we were kids. During our most intense training, Jack was the hardest to crack open. “They took mom.” His voice cracked, but instead of crying, he stabbed his gun into Freddie’s temple. “But we’re going to get her back.”\n\nSomething inside me came apart, and I found myself feeling… sympathy for my old classmate. This kid had lost his parents, lost all semblance of a normal life. \n\nHe saw a psychopath as a mother figure, as his protector. “No.” the words came out of my mouth in a splutter. “No, Jack, she’s not your mother.” Risking a glance at Freddie, who gave me the nod of approval, I let out a breath. “You have a mom.” I said softly. “You have a mom and a dad, but she made us forget about them, do you remember?” I held his gaze. “I was lucky. My dad found me before it was too late.” I caught myself when his expression twisted, and Freddie shot me an, “Oh, fuck.” Look. “I can help you find your parents.”\n\n“Mattie.” Issac hissed out. “Are you seriously trying to reason with these freaks?!”\n\nJack blinked at me, his eyes narrowing, and I realised I’d found a wound I could press on and use as leverage.\n\nI said his name as softly as I could with my teeth gritted. “You need to listen to me—”\n\nHe cut me off suddenly with a hiss. “No, you need to listen to me!” Clicking the safety off, the boy shoved Freddie to his knees with one hand, and reached into the pocket of his coat with the other. I thought he was going to pull out a knife, but it was a crumpled piece of paper.\n\nWhen I stared at it stupidly, he gestured for me to take it.\n\n“What is it?”\n\nJack rolled his eyes, stamping his feet. “Just taaaakeeee itttt!”\n\nI hated that I recognised the handwriting. It was my own cursive in pink crayon. It was the declaration we had been made to sign.\n\n“I, MATILDA POLLUX, SOLOMNLY SWEAR I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO PROTECT MY TEACHER! AND STAY WITH MY CLASSMATES UNTIL I DIE!”\n\nSigned: Matilda Pollux. 06/02/2009.\n\nLifting my gaze, I met eyes with a smiling Jack, who pulled out his own declaration. Sadie, Jasper and Evie did too, waving their own.\n\n“You’re kidding.” Scrunching up the paper between my fist, I swallowed a groan. “I was eight.”\n\nJack shrugged. “You pinkie swore.”\n\n“We were eight!” I couldn’t resist yelling. Shooting a look at Freddie who looked baffled, I shook my head. “You’re insane!”\n\nMy classmate cocked his head. “But you promisseeeeed!” He whined, prodding the paper. “See! You wrote it right here!”\n\n“We were kids, Jack! This isn’t…. this is nothing to do with me!”\n\nJack nodded to my surprise.\n\n“Mmmm kay.” He said.\n\nThen he twisted around and shot Sadie straight through the head. The girl dropped to the ground, showering Jasper in sharp red. The boy didn’t move, his expression stoic. Penny screamed and ducked her head, Issac and Freddie attempting to get up and being shoved down.\n\n“Now it’s something to do with you.” Jack’s grin widened when I had to choke back a scream. “Relax! She was a stupid head, anyway.”\n\n“Mattie!” Isaac’s voice cut through my thoughts. I was watching Sadie’s blood staining our carpet I’d spent half an hour vacuuming the night before.\n\n“Please. Get rid of them. Whoever these people are, they’re not… normal! They’re deranged!”\n\nI can’t.\n\nI wanted to tell him that. I wanted to tell him that my elementary school classmates were more than wrong. More than messed up and deranged. But I couldn’t speak.\n\n“I’m boooored.” Jack announced with an exaggerated groan. Scratching the back of his head with his gun, he sighed. “If you’re not going to come with us, then we can bring someone else instead.” He dragged Freddie to his feet. “It’s never too late for a new classmate, right?”\n\nWhen Freddie was pulled back, yanked by his hair, I found my voice. But it was choked into the back of my throat when Evie grabbed me, pinning my arms behind my back. Laughing, Jack disappeared with my housemate, with Evie pulling Penny along with them. The last thing I saw was Freddie’s mouth being covered, the look of fright in his eyes. The screams rattling through the house when the two of them reached the hallway told me Penny was yet to witness her boyfriend’s grisly beheading. Before I could fully register what was happening, I was being brought to my knees. Pippa was in front of me, grasping hold of my face and cradling it, giggling, while Jasper wrapped tough rope around my wrists. When Issac was shoved down too, the two of us back to back, I understood what was happening. \n\nEspecially when the TV and Freddie’s laptop turned on by themselves, a sickly white light illuminating the room. When Pippa prodded my cheeks, giggling, I screamed. All I could see was the flickering red images in my eyes. All I could feel was my hands being forced down by my teacher, and my crying gradually morphing into laugher, joining a symphony with my classmates. No. I had nightmares about the dancing red dot. \n\nI woke alone in isolation, screaming into my lap. The red dot had twisted my thoughts into cotton candy and made me think blood on my hands was a good thing. It made me think of gore as colourful, like sparkly glitter all over my skin. Dismembered bodies were doll pieces, and the world was a playground I didn’t want to leave. But once I had snapped out of it, once my father’s hands had been grasping hold of mine, the night I had murdered and mutilated Thomas Haywood and his college aged kids, my world had crumbled. Waking up was like being shot in the head.\n\nI woke to red spattering my hands and face, my cheeks. Except I was smiling. I couldn’t stop smiling, even when dad slapped me across the face. I couldn’t go through it again. I couldn’t. I was aware of my mouth open in a silent cry, my back pressed to Isaac’s trembling with every violent thrust.  As if Pippa could sense my fear, her smile grew. “Isn’t this exciting?” She squealed. “You get to watch the red video all over again!” The two of them seemed to dance around us, looming figures bleeding into the dark, into that eerie white light which switched to red, automatically dragging my gaze to the screen. “Mattie?” Isaac’s voice felt far-away, like a whisper of wind in my ear. “What’s going on?”\n\nIsaac’s voice shook, his body struggling against mine. “Fuck. I can’t look away.”\n\nSqueezing my eyes shut, I bit into my lower lip so hard I tasted blood. The good thing was that I could no longer sense the others. The bad thing was that they had taken my housemates who knows where, and I was about to enter third grade again.  “Close your eyes. Do it. Now.”\n\n“But.. I can’t.”\n\n“Yes you can!” Fighting with the rope entangled around our wrists, I focused on counting how many seconds Issac was exposed to it.\n\nTen years ago, it had taken multiple sessions and even forcing us to place our hands on the table, for the video to get into our head,.\n\nThis one, however, was different.\n\n“Issac?” I said, after a moment of silence.\n\n“Mmm? Yeah, I can’t move,” he stopped wiggling in the restraints. “Mattie, they took Freddie.”\n\n“Yeah.” I heaved out a breath. “I know.”\n\nFifteen seconds.\n\nI felt him tense up. “They took him… and we’re just sitting here….” He paused. “Just… vibing with these red dots, huh.”\n\nSeventeen seconds.\n\n“Hold on,” I told him. “Just think about Freddie. We’re getting him back.”\n\nIssac didn’t reply.\n\nNineteen seconds.\n\nAlmost there. Pulling my restraints apart, I lunged to my feet, slammed the laptop shut, switched off the TV, and knelt in front of Issac. He looked okay. I mean, I shook him, and he blinked, dragging his gaze to me. His nose was bleeding, thick rivulets of red running down his chin, but I ignored it. I told myself to ignore it. “Isssac.” Once I untied him, he was still sitting cross legged, a frown on his lips. When I caught his eyes creeping towards the Tv screen, I clapped my hands in front of his face. “Hey!” I was panicking. “What’s the capital of Australia?”\n\n“Canberra.”\n\n“Uh-huh.” I had to shove him to stop the boy from turning back to the TV. “Hey, focus! How many fingers am I holding up?”\n\nIssac squinted, and I swiped at his nose with the sleeve of my jacket. “Do thumbs count?” He shooed my hands away, scowling. “Get off me, I’m fine!”\n\nRelief flooded through me when he dived to his feet, swiping at his face. “What the ever-loving FUCK was that about?”\n\n“You don’t need to know.” I managed to get out. “Do you have your phone?”\n\nIssac nodded. “Yeah.” He jutted his head towards the kitchen. “Can you get me a glass of water first? Feels like I’m sucking on sandpaper.”\n\nWhile he searched for his phone, I hurried into the kitchen, grabbed a glass from the cupboard and filled it with water. I was grabbing another glass for myself, when something moved in the reflection of the glass. Mrs Teller taught us about this. Always look behind you because enemies were closer than you think. Her words rang in my head, when I tightened my grip on my glass, and swung around, smashing it into the side of Isaac’s head. I was too slow. Issac easily stepped out of the way, and the glass shattered once it hit the countertop. His hands were already snaking around my neck and holding me above him, before smashing my head against the counter and sending me to the ground. Starbursts in my vision, a neutron star collision going off in my head. \n\nMrs Teller told us about surprise attacks, but her words were alphabet soup in the back of my head as I struggled to stay conscious. When I managed to force myself onto my knees, Isaac’s foot was coming down on my neck, pinning me to the floor. I gasped for breath, sensing him looming over me. “I’m sorrrrrry,” he said. “No really, I am sorry,” Issac sounded like himself, which was the worst part. If concentrated hard enough, I could detect a slight whine to his tone.\n\nLike he’d re-entered the third grade.\n\n“I didn’t mean to hurt you, Mattie,” Issac sang. “But we should probably… get to claaaaaaaass.”\n\nIf that wasn’t bad enough, with one final kick to my head, I was plunging into the dark, awake enough to feel his hands wrapping around my ankles and dragging….\n\nThe memory was quick to take centre stage once I was out of it, and I found myself back inside my little self’s body.\n\nThe jello tasted like cardboard candy, but it was the first thing I’d had to eat. So, I plugged my nose and forced it into my mouth, spoonful by spoonful. Each time my hand trembled around the plastic spoon, knowing my father was just outside the door. He was talking about them, and every time that thought slid into my mind, something in my mind snapped. I needed to see them. Like a drug running through my veins, I was desperate to see my classmates. The ones who had gotten away. We were a family. That’s what Mrs Teller told us. All of us were a family, and our own didn’t matter anymore. We were going to do wonderful things for her. \n\nStarting with killing the bad people. \n\nThe ones who refused to allow her to use us in her research. They were all bad people—and they were going to die.  If I concentrated, I could still feel the blood slick between my palms, and no matter how many tests and scans I had—different people telling me that what I was feeling was BAD and not GOOD, I craved the feeling again. Hot and sticky and wet on my hands and arms, dripping on my skin. \n\nWhen orange jello began to creep up my throat, I threw it against the wall. My head was doing the scary thing again. It was working ahead of me, moving me before I knew what was happening. Mrs Teller’s voice was cemented inside my brain, a leech refusing to let go. “Move like a slithery snake,” she had told us. “Do not let your pray go. Do you understand me? Never, and I mean NEVER underestimate your enemy. Remember that, class.”\n\nWith her words echoing in my skull, I took sharp steps across the room of white, pressing my ear against cold metal, listening out for my father’s voice. Instead though, there was only the strange man with the bald head. I didn’t like him. When we had been alone in his office, the man had leaned forward and asked me if I would be okay with dying for my country. I didn’t like that. So, I blew a big raspberry at him.\n\n“Mr Pollux.” Mr Baldy’s voice came loud and clear. “I want you to stay calm. Do you understand me? Your daughter is safe.”\n\n“She’s not, though!” Dad’s voice made my tummy hurt. I could sense him pacing the white winding corridor, and I wanted to join him. “I want to know. No sugar-coating or hiding, none of that bullshit. I want to know what that psycho has done to my daughter. Right now.”\n\nDad held his breath. “Or… I go to the press. You have my daughter locked up. I have rights.”\n\n“Mr Pollux, you signed—”\n\n“I don’t care! I want you to see me as a father and nothing else. I just want to know what’s going on.”\n\nMr Baldy paused. “It’s… what she hasn’t done is what we should think about. Penelope Teller is currently in possession of Protocol Four. Which automatically makes these kids a severe threat if she is to use it. And if she does so, we will unfortunately be greenlighting Shoot To Kill.”\n\nBefore my father could speak, the man continued. “You don’t need to know a lot of things, Mr Pollux. Due to health and safety reasons, as well as heavily classified information on the behalf of the United States government, I will tell you from an unprofessional standpoint,” he exhaled out a breath. “I have…a  daughter. And a son. In this line of work, I have to keep changing my name, and even the names of my children, to keep them safe.  They are both your child’s age. What I will tell you as a father, is that your daughter is incredibly, and I mean incredibly lucky, that you managed to catch her at the most primitive point, when that initial seed was planted. If not, we would be having a very different conversation. But what I can tell you,” he lowered his voice so I had to close my eyes and attempt to break through that barrier Mrs Teller told us about. Which worked with senses too. \n\n“Protocol 4, also known as White Rabbit, is an experimental… uh… mind exercise, which was originally to be tested in prisoners. However, due to the… uh…. Repercussions of the experiment, and the lives lost, including several of our researchers, as questioning the morality of this specific… exercise… the documents were destroyed, and the protocol was shut down.” He cleared his throat. \n\n“That was, until Penelope Teller, one of our ex agents, took it upon herself to test the protocol on a new group of subjects.” Mr Baldy’s voice shook slightly. “Which was of course your daughter and the fourteen missing children.”\n\n“So you’re saying,” my dad’s voice was a yell, and I resisted the urge to slam my hands over my ears. “That one of your people has gone rogue, is currently driving a busload of eight year olds who knows where, and completely fucked up my daughter’s head? How did she even get hold of a school bus?”\n\n“No, no!” Mr Baldy let out a polite laugh. “No, what you’re not understanding, Mr Pollux, is that right now your daughter is right where she needs to be. She is safe and sound.” He did the clear your throat thing again, and I could tell he was hiding something. “It’s the… ahh, it’s the others we need to be worried about. You see, Teller also took an experimental... let’s call it a ‘mind exercise’ which has in fact not been peer reviewed. In fact, it was in its earliest stage of development when stolen. And this, Mr Pollux, is why these children will become Shoot To Kill. If this experimental technology is to be used on them, they will be considered as a Code Black. And disposed of as soon as possible.”\n\nA memory was blooming behind my eyes. I was inside my third grade classroom in front of the red screen.\n\nJack Torres was in the desk next to me. His hands which were supposed to be pinned in front of him were shaking me. I was looking at the screen, but at the corner of my eye, I could see that he was scared, choking on blood pooling from his nose, his eyes wide. Unlike the others, Jack wasn’t watching the video. “Matilda?” \n\nHe twisted around to see if the teacher was looking, before shoving me violently. Jack was always the one who couldn’t hold a knife properly, whose fingers trembled around the trigger when told to shoot a bad man. “Matilda, please!”\n\nI didn’t reply, but his voice never left my ears, until he was caught.\n\nDad’s voice was back, bringing me back to the initial memory, two separate periods of my life entwining in my mind.\n\n“But—”\n\nMr Baldy cut dad off. “However.” He said. “That is very unlikely. We have teams looking for them right now and can assure you of their immediate capture and rehabilitation. What we can be thankful for right now, is that these children will not be much of a problem due to their age. We are positive we can round them up as soon as possible. If, and it’s a big if—these children were to grow up with this kind of influence, and protocol 5 in place…” \n\nHe drifted off. “Theoretical, of course! Then we will be considering them as a threat to civilian safety. But it’s the newest protocol which we need to look out for. It’s known as the silent killer. It takes a mind within a matter of seconds, subjecting it to ten times the influence the usual protocol. If this is used, Mr Pollux, I want you and your daughter out of this country. Because once these subjects are given a command, whether written or spoken out loud, they will not stop. They will drag anyone in their path to either join them, or blow their brains out with the click of a finger. Protocol Five was made in case we as a country ever became face to face with a war we wouldn’t be able to win—and if I am correct, these children, if they are not captured and rehabilitated, they will become humanity’s greatest threat. Possessing capabilities and strength way beyond our comprehension, what adult men and women soldiers have struggled with during initial testing stages. We didn’t even get inclusive results. That is how new the technology is, and when abused, it will be a matter of national security. Because these children will no longer be ones who we can reason with and talk to, Mr Pollux. Instead,  they will be--”\n\n“Weapons.” Dad finished for him, and I stumbled away from the door, pressed my hands over my ears, and screamed.",

        "text": "The air was hot, still, and oppressively humid. A mountain range of towering dark clouds loomed on the horizon, but only wisps of moisture floated overhead. Floridian summer. He grabbed his pack from the back of the car. All accounts said that it was only a couple of miles to the spring. Five minutes out of the air conditioning, and his entire body was already coated in a sheen of sweat. He took a long drink from his water bottle and set out. \n\nThe trail was a thin gash of sandy soil through the thick underbrush. Longleaf pines stood tall and proud, their twisted branches offering a small island of shade. Their scaly red-brown bark shined in the unyielding sunlight. He stopped. The forest was deathly silent. Not a single bird sang, or creature scuttled through the underbrush. A cool breeze floated through the trees, and the pines whispered softly. The breeze was better than a kiss. He drank another drink of water. \n\nHe approached a small sign. The bleached wood proclaimed: Forbidden Spring- 1 mile. The narrow path led into a thick hammock. Gnarled scrub oaks stretched into the air, curving like the bodies of snakes. Thick clumps of Palmetto lined the pathway, and tendrils of moss hung limply from the branches of the trees.The shade was welcome, but the dense canopy made the lingering wetness feel even closer. The path became even more narrow, the fronds of the Palmetto brushing over his wet skin. After a few more minutes, he had to walk sideways, edging along as he was buffeted front and back by the encroaching plants. Sweat poured from every inch of his body, and he finally felt the bite of the sun on his face again. \n\nHe had reached a clearing. The path opened into a large swath of dirt and tall grass. Flowers and  pock marked protrusions of limestone sprouted at the edges of the wide ring, and at the center: a tree. It was a monstrous live oak. The trunk was as thick as a mobile home, and its lowest branches swooped up into the air before descending to kiss the ground. A thick carpet of ferns and lichen clung to the ancient branches. Clumps of Spanish Moss, as thick and as long as a person hung from the sturdy younger branches. He approached the tree with mouth agape, staring at this wise and powerful being. The bark of the tree was as black as the depths of a cave. He reached out his hand and touched it. Despite its deep grooves, the bark felt smooth. \n\n*It felt like skin.* \n\nHe wrenched his hand off of the trunk, and his head swam as he staggered away. His legs became as weak as a newborn deer. He flailed, his head spinning violently, and crumpled onto the  earth. \n\nHe opened his eyes and looked around. A breeze rippled through the great tree. The moss swayed lazily, and the leaves rustled, no louder than a shared secret. He turned his head. A woman walked into the clearing, her face as calm as swamp water. She was as naked as an animal, and she was beautiful. Her hair, a rusty red, cascaded down to her feet. Her skin, tan and  glistening with a film of moisture. She helped him from the ground and looked into his eyes. Her eyes were luminescent, the color of sunshine falling on new leaves in spring. Her gaze was unflinching. She kissed him on the mouth, and stroked her fingers through his hair. She kissed his neck, and pulled him close so he could feel her breasts press against him. She undid his pants, pulling out his already bulging erection. She whispered in his ear. It was the sound of wind drifting through the forest, the soft whisper of leaves and pine needles. Yet he knew what she said all the same. \n\n*Be mineeeee* \n\nBeneath  the fever of his desire, he could hear a voice deep in his mind telling him no. Warning him not to do it. She placed his hands on her breasts, and let him feel the soft skin and her hard nipples. The small voice forgotten, he slid himself inside her as he kissed her again. Pulled her closer to him as his pleasure mounted. The great moment of release, and she looked into his eyes and smiled. \n\nHe awoke at the base of the great tree. He stood. The tree's bark was light brown. He stroked the tree's trunk and felt its coarse ridges and mountains. \n\n“Is that strange?” He couldn't help but think so.\n\n“I'm hot” he thought. “I need to get to the spring and cool off”. \n\nHe walked to the opposite side of the clearing and picked up the trail again. The dappled shade of the massive tree yielded to the relentless sun of the pine scrub. The sun bore down on him without mercy. Sweat ran off of him in rivers, and he dragged his feet through the thick sand underfoot. The silence of the forest was only disturbed by his shuddering breathing. He walked. Bushes began to flick and stab at him, but they were dulled by the onslaught of the persistent heat. He looked around to observe that he had walked off the trail into the undergrowth. He reached for his water bottle, mumbling and wiping his brow. His fingers felt stiff and refused his insistence to open the bottle. It slid from his fingers and fell into the baking sand. \n\nThe sweat poured like a summer thunderstorm. The spring was the only thing that mattered now. His body felt stiff and weak. He tried to swipe the stinging sweat from his eyes, but could not lift his arms to relieve himself. His left leg dragged through the lashing undergrowth. His spine became rigid all at once, and he lost balance and fell. \n\nThe sand scorched his skin. He looked at his arm. The skin was hard and mottled, scales of rusty red with deep trenches between them. He passed out. \n\nWhen he awoke, he could not see. He screamed with all his power, but no sound came from the void of silence. He commanded every cell in his body to move, but he could not even quiver. \n\nA cool breeze wafted over him. It felt as sweet as the caress of a lover, a cold drink on a scorching day. Leaves and needles rustled. And he heard it: \n\n“Now you are mineeee”",
