I'm using hoffman's better 1 cup v60 recipe [which is a 5 pour method](https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM), the 1zpresso JX grinder at what they lost on their guide as a moka pot setting [link for the guide](https://1zpresso.coffee/grind-setting/) and the 02 size V60 with a light roast blend. The total brew time is about 4:30, compared to Hoffmann's ~3:00. Again, it tastes ok to me, but since I'm new I wanted to see if perhaps I'm missing something I could be doing better.",

Apparently there are some carbon / activated charcoal filters that have a specific pore size so that they filter out only caffeine, but I can't seem to find those anywhere (maybe because I don't know what those filters are called).\n\nAnyone who knows the name of the filters or some other way to extract caffeine (from the GCE, not the green coffee beans)- I would really appreciate your help on this!!

        "text": " \n\n(cross-posted in James Hoffman group)\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nI primarly drink lattes and so most of my focus is in that direction. However, I do like to have other tools at my disposal. I currently own a Clever and a Hario Mugen as well. I like the Mugen for light roasts, and since I am not really doing a daily focus on pour over, I went with the Mugen instead of the regular V60 since it's more forgiving.\n\nI like my clever too! I love the ability to do immersion if I want, plus it still produces a nice amount of clarity (I have Kingrinder K6 that I use for all my non-espresso methods, btw).\n\nI previously owned an Aeropress that I liked a lot, but I had gotten rid of it years ago, way before I got a lot more \"into\" this hobby.\n\nOkay, all of this to say- the thing I think I miss out on with the Clever and Mugen is \"body.\" I love the flavors of coffee and the clarity I can get with some of these methods is really cool. But sometimes I want a thicker mouthfeel. I'm like this way with whiskey too! Sometimes I want a super complex, multiple casked Scotch, but sometimes I want a thick bourbon that just more mouth coating.\n\nSo- my question is, is French Press the only method to achieve this? Is it simply the metal filter? I find that the clever produces a cup with a bit more body than the Mugen- which makes sense since it's immersion- but it still doesn't come close to that oilyness I get out of a french press.\n\nI recently did James' recipe and I really liked it. I had no sludge, it was a pretty clean cup but it still that body, much more than my other methods. So is this the only way? The Espro is an interesting looking press, but does that not produce the same body as let's say a Bodum?\n\nI apologize for the long rant here, just trying to provide full context. TL;DR: is the french press simply the only method that will give the most body, and is that strictly due to the nature of metal vs paper filter?\n\nThanks so much for all your help!",

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nfinally found &amp; solved an issue we had with our coffee machine Barista Express BES875 (which should be the same for different models Sage / Breville / Stollar when it comes to how they work)\n\nour coffee machine stopped pouring hot water from filter/ group head. steam and hot water had no issue at all. but once you brewed coffee - all the water went into the dip tray. I had to look up many different sources online and the most useful was from someone who figured how the water flows in the system [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lMw6ooiqPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lMw6ooiqPI) \n\nwhile many people online suggested to change the solenoid, I took it apart and found that it had some scale on the coil/ valve. I cleaned it up with vinegar and it turns out that was the issue. apparently the scale affects the coil to pull the valve it has on the inside and to switch between hot water/ steam to group head \n\n(although I still don't get it why the water tray was full - maybe it  went through steam/hot water passage instead of solenoid drain)\n\nanyway I will add some photos and sources, maybe some of you will find useful:\n\n1. water flow scheme photo (https://wiki.jmehan.com/display/KNOW/Breville+Barista+Repair)\n\n2. how to disassemble coffee machine [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IuKiuIB5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IuKiuIB5A)\n\n3. solenoid parts https://www.espressoparts.com/blogs/barista-basics-tutorials/solenoids\n\n4. replacement parts just in case https://www.ereplacementparts.com/breville-bes870xl-the-barista-express-parts-c-116052\\_116055\\_290179.html\n\nenjoy your coffee!",

I’ve watched all the YouTube videos I can and that’s just making me more confused. I have about $200 to spend and would like something that could grind for espresso since eventually I would love to get into that. I really don’t care if it’s hand or electric but the ease of electric would be nice. I mostly do pour over and Moka pot. Any advice for a noob?\nThank you",

Me and my friend have basically the same machine (CREM EX3) and to help them out I cleaned their machine yesterday. \n\nThey have been having some trouble with the consistency of the espresso shots since they got the machine. I soak my porter filters and shower screens every night to keep things clean and I did the same to theirs. \n\nI have a proper tool to get the shower screens out along with the rubber group gaskets, I pry mine out easily without damaging the rubber seal, however theirs was a challenge to get out. \nIs this due to the Rubber Group Seals being new? Too large or small? Or are they worn out?\n No visible sign of anything but normal wear and tear. They did seem a bit large...\n\nI soaked and cleaned the shower screens and noticed a build up inside. I also noticed that the screen seemed to be not tight, it had a little give. \nIs this a replacement job? Or a maintenance issue? They do a lot of coffee a day (more than me) \nThey clean these parts once every 3 days. Is that enough? \n\nLastly, I read in the user manual that if your porter filter is being tightened too much (like too much to the right) when you put it in the gasket that that can cause wear to the rubber seal. The main barista pulls it very far to the right when locking it in that now you have to do it every time. Is this an issue?\n\nSo the big question, is the possible wear and tear to the rubber seal and the looseness to the shower screen affecting their consistency of their espresso? Thank you x",

It seems to be a small amount, is it normal that I'm seeing the inside edges of the porta filter? \n\nAlso, I've tried to grind my coffee the smallest I could at 8g, pressed it quite hard and my machine would explose of pressure. So I tried to do it A LITTLE less fine, but then it would come out with a blond colour very fast.\n\nI've never seen a brown espresso drip from my Breville Roma.. I'm using the kit that comes with it (single espresso basket, plasic tamper) I grind by hand...\n\nI've been trying for 2 hours with different size at 8g but nothing comes out brown! Or it comes out brown for 1 drip... Help 🥹",
