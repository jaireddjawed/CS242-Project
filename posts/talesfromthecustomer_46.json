I ended up just leaving the fiver and loonie on the register and walked out saying, \"your till won't balance otherwise.\"\n\nHas anybody else had an experience were a clerk was adamant you gave them more money than you actually did and argue about it?",

        "text": "So this happened to my mom, not to me, but I was there while it happened, so... \n\nRecently my mother got a new car because her old reliable truck finally kicked it. She barely has the thing a month and she notices a bolt in her tire while we're out grabbing dinner, no big deal, go to the dealership she bought the car from because it's like a five minute drive up the road. We get there and it's a solid 45 minutes before closing which I remember because I checked the time and the closing time on the door to make sure we weren't gonna get kicked out.\n\n So after being ignored by about 3 guys screwing around at their desks finally Dealership Jerk (DJ!) comes up and she explains the problem. First words out of his mouth, without even glancing at the tire?\n\n&gt;DJ: Yeah I can't fix that today. It's gonna take like thirty to forty minutes and we close soon. \n\nNow, my mom's had bolts in her tires before. The guys that took the last one out of her truck tire took less than ten minutes. 10-20 minutes is about average, as far as I know. Even at the *absolute longest* it shouldn't take longer than 30.\n\n&gt;My mom: Um, okay, can you at least look at it and make sure it's stable? What are you going to do that's going to take that long, can't you just patch it?\n\nDJ sort of glances at it for like, twenty seconds then shrugs, going into some spiel about how super incredibly time consuming and difficult it is to take the tire off, remove the bolt, and patch it. \n\n&gt;DJ: Doesn't look like it's leaking air and we're closed tomorrow but you can come in Monday. It'll just take too much time and there's no way we can do this today. Sorry.\n\n...And he just walks away. By the end of this conversation there was a solid 20-30 minutes left before closing time and customers still going in and out, and other people working here are still ignoring us.\n\nIcing on the cake? The very next day it started leaking air at a dangerously fast rate. She went to an auto shop where they fixed it in under fifteen minutes despite being absolutely swamped with customers and only one tech on duty.\n\nShe wrote to the owner of the dealership to complain about the guy but still hasn't heard back, 2 weeks later. Not surprising considering this isn't even the first problem with crappy customer service she's had from them.\n\n**~UPDATE~** - So I told my mom all y'alls advice and she emailed Chevy corporate this morning, as well as the service manager at the dealership. No answer from the dealership, surprise surprise, but corporate got back to her within a few hours with an email AND a phone call wanting to know more in depth about what happened so they could help. Far as I know she and the corporate guy are emailing right now. Will let you guys know how it goes as it progresses! ",

I had been to a couple other stores that day, and finally found a dress I really liked, that I felt I looked awesome in. I usually have a super hard time finding things I feel good in, so I was excited. The only problem was, it had no sleeves, just little strips of fabric to hold it up.\n\n\nSince the fitting rooms were right next to where the dresses and cover-up cardigans,sweaters,etc were, I kept the dress on and wandered that small area looking for one I liked. I didn't see any I liked, and decided it couldn't hurt to ask an employee if there were more sweaters elsewhere in the store.\n\n\nI walk up to a woman, and here's how it goes:\nMe: Excuse me, do you have any other sweaters or maybe even nice scarves I could try on to go with this dress (working retail myself, I know it's easier to help a customer if they're specific about what they want and what it's for).\n\n\nHer: *looks me up and down, not in a nice way* Mmmmm, not for you *said condescendingly, clearly not said in an attempt to help me out* *she then walks off before I can say anything else*\n\n\nNote that I never asked if she liked the dress. I already decided I wanted it, I loved it, felt great in it, and other than the spaghetti straps it was nice and modest. I didn't end up saying anything to management, because I then changed and ran out of there so fast, and didn't think to check her name.",

Infront of us is several of the waiters holding the doors and this gentelmen and cashier  \n  \nCashier: how was everything? I hope it was good!  \nrandom guy: Oh it was great, very tasty. ¿Donde est la caca? (I have no idea how to spell in spanish)  \n  \nNow...I make no claim to understand Spanish but I know enough of those words to make a sentence...Where is the *shit*? I have to have mis-heard him. I look around and several of the waiters have somewhat of a confused-half paying attention look. Ah well.  \n  \nCustomer: ¿Donde est la caca?  \n  \nOk that time I know what I heard....yeah he definately said it and based on the fact that both the waiters and the cashier are staring at him, they heard it too... At this point I'm dumbfounded...what the heck is this guy trying to say.  \n  \nCashier: Ummm have a nice day sir.  \nCustomer: Oh you too, thanks much!  \n  \nAnd off he goes never acknowledging the fact of what he just said.....  \n  \n*Guess we won't be coming back*  \nSo once again my buddy and I are eating here and we finish our meal and go up to pay.  \n  \nWe're greeted with the sight of them pulling all their outdoor decorations in and a \"CLOSED\" sign on the front.....at 11:45 in the (nearly)afternoon.  \n \nFinding this odd I track down one of the waiters.  \n  \nme: \"Ummm excuse me, what's going on?\"    \nWaiter: \"Health inspector closed us down.\"  \n  \nI almost threw up in the street.",

Either way, the first few times I went, I got the same cashier, a sweet old lady, let's name her Cherie (she called me that a few times). Cherie was the sweetest, kindest, funniest old gal I've ever had the pleasure to meet. She always had a quick story to tell me while she rang me up, and we became fast friends.\n\nAnyway, a few months later, my folks left me some money for pizza and drinks while they went out of state to help some relatives. There was also a pizza place a few buildings down, so I went to get it from there. Unfortunately, their soft drink fridge was busted and all the soda was lukewarm. Eww. No biggie, I'll just run across the street and grab some soda at the grocery.\n\nI went in and grabbed a 12-pack of ginger ale and a couple of cans of iced tea. I got up to the register and got out my wallet to pay, but while counting I realized I wouldn't have enough for the pizza *and* the drinks. I explained as such to Cherie when she asked what was wrong, and she offered to pay out of her own pocket for the drinks. I tried to insist on giving her a little cash as compensation, but she would have none of it. I thanked her, hugged her, and left with my drinks.\n\ntl;dr, be nice to your cashiers.",

Get to the second window they hand us out food I look in the bag and everything is there and on one of the boxes I can see it says no cheese, no _ sauce, add mustard. Okay cool it's right. \n\nWe drive 5 minutes and get home sit down on the bed and open our boxes. Mine is completely original which was right. His completely original as well. As if they ignored not one but 3 requests and made  the burger as is despite the receipt, and the actually food ticket saying otherwise.  I end up taking it back up there because as someone who has worked at 4 fast food places during high school &amp; until recently in college still it peeves me to no end on how you can get something wrong when it says it all right in front of you. \n\nWhen I took it back up there I was very unhappy but it wasn't the cashiers fault she had nothing to do with it (for that matter everyone except the cook did it right because the receipt when the order was taken was right!) so I calmly told her the situation she takes it back there and the MANAGER is the one on the cooking line.. I'm sorry for this rant but I feel she had to of just blatantly ignored what it said because damn, this is just ridiculous or am I just in the wrong? ",

I had dropped my wife off for something and had time to burn so I decided to go window shopping and browsing around the mall while I waited on her.  \n  \nLo and behold I wind up in one of the three stores in the mall that I actually slightly cared about: Radio Shack. As I walk in this girl at the counter greets me and asks if there's anything she could do to which I politely decline and continue browsing around the store.  \n  \nIn comes another customer who marches right up to the counter and starts talking to the girl. I didn't catch the start of the conversation but I could see what the problem was. This customer was trying to put a micro sd card into an older camera that only took a proprietary memory card.  \n  \nThis poor girl is stuck trying to explain that what he's asking for is simply not possible. I didn't take note of what was going on, the conversation was pretty civil and she was being very polite about it. Then he asks, \"Can I speak to your manager for a second.\"  \n  \n\"Oh, uh, sure! One moment.\"  \n\"Not a problem at all.\"  \n  \nSo off she goes to get the manager and as soon as he shows up.  \n  \n\"Your employee has dis-respected me. All I wanted was a simple memory card and she wouldn't even tell me where to find it and when I wanted help she got aggressive with me. This is the last time I shop at this store.\"   \n  \nAnd with that he turns on his heel and marches out the door, smirking as he crosses the threshold back into the mall.  \n  \nMy jaw was absolutely on the floor staring at this entire thing. The poor girl was on the verge of tears and I heard the manager say, \"We'll discuss this when your shift is over.\"  \n  \nI couldn't believe it, this girl did nothing wrong and due to the incompetence of this sleazebag she was going to get in trouble. Not to mention that half the crap that just came out of his mouth was wrong and complete bullshit. I grabbed the cheapest item within arms reach (I think it was double a batteries or something) and marched up to the counter and was checking out.   \n  \nThis poor girl was seriously upset about what happened and very quietly checked me out. After she handed me my receipt I chimed in, \"Hey, I'd like to speak to your manager for a second.\"  \n  \nShe nearly broke down and squeamishly responded, \"Just a moment please.\"  \n  \nOff she went back to the office and out comes the manager again. \"Yes sir, how can I help you?\"  \n  \n\"I just wanted to let you know that I witnessed the entire exchange between your employee here and that last customer and I couldn't believe the customer would lie like that. Your employee did nothing wrong, acted with the utmost respect and professionalism and didn't even ask for help in whatever it was he wanted. I know it's hard for someone like her to argue against a customer but I wanted to chime in on equal footing as that jerk and state that the fault entirely was on him.\"  \n  \nThe manager looked shocked and that did it for the girl, the tears started flowing. The manager let her go to the back to regain her composure and I shook the manager's hand and left. I honestly don't know what happened to that girl after I left as I moved away shortly after.  \n  \nEdit: don't know if this violates the rules since I did mention the name of the store but it's not specifically about the store in any way.",

We made our reservations and when the time we walked down to the restaraunt\n\nNow this particular restaurant is located in a hotel, along with at least one if not two other restaurants. This is important because when we got to our restaurant we found that they did not have our reservations on file. It turned out they had accidentally put us down for reservations in one of the other restaurants (their systems were connected). This was doubly problemactic as therestaurant was full for the night.\n\nWhen we asked if there was anything they could do they asked us to wait 10 minutes while they checked on a reservation. After waiting, they came back to us and told us that they were able to seat us as they had a reservation that had been canceled.\n\nThey then proceeded to sit us at the Chef's table. I don't even know how you get to sit at the Chef's table in a super fancy restaurant under normal conditions, especially at peak hours. I feel like normally you would either need to make reservations WAY in advance, pay a ton of money, be someone important or a combination of the above.\n\nDinner was delicious and we got to watch them make it through the huge window into the kitchen. Our table had special lighting and a centerpiece on it. Partway through the meal the head chef came out to talk to us and ensure we liked our meal. \n\nI would have been happy that they were able to seat us given the reservation SNAFU. To be sat at the chef's table was something I never would have even dreamed of. I felt like I was a prince or something.\n\nFor reference, The chefs table is the table at far end of this picture next to the window. When the restaurant lights are dimmed the table is illuminated differently then the rest of the restaurant so you really feel like you are the center of attention.

Luckily for me, an autoparts store is right down the road from my workplace, so I used to frequent to buy various things for my money pit of a vehicle. \n\n So in search of this dimmer switch, I called ahead of time to see if they even had it. They did the typical \"whats the year, model, etc\" and asked what I was looking for, so they could do a parts lookup. They put me on hold, for an hour, and by that time it was time for me to go to work, so I hung up, and figured I'd stop in after my shift to see if they were able to track it down. \n\n Enter me into the store, and an cranky old woman is sitting behind the counter snapping her gum. She immediately starts our conversation with \"what does HE need?\" No, I need it, thank you. I ignore it and go on to tell her what I'm looking for, and she cut me off with a \"oh so you're the little nag that hung up on us.\" I'm now a little more than angry and I informed her that I was on the line for over an hour, and I had a job to get to. She finished it off with \"Well, that sucks, we don't even have the part for your POS.\"\n\nSo I no longer go there, and even through I hate to do it, I ended up calling corp. to report her.",

I was near the toy section of course so I expected there to be whining and \"why won't you get me this\" comments from young kids, but this was something different. I went to the toy section, and there were two unsupervised young boys messing around. They were throwing things and knocking over boxes, so I went to go get an employee. I saw someone in a Derp Mart uniform and asked them for help, mentioning the fact that there were no parents around. They still said, \"the parents can deal with it.\" I gave up eventually (not botheing to get a manager) and decided to go back and look at the Pokemon cards. Worst thing was that I was one isle away from the kids. I soon heard yelling and the sound of hands against flesh, and realized their mother was hitting them. I took my cards, reunited with my mom, and went home.\n\nSo far that was the worst experience I had ever had there.",

I don't know what they did, or if Larry took everything when they went out yesterday but the dividers were all empty so I don't know. Do you know what the HOA is doing? \n\nMe: What? I have no idea what you're saying. Someone else has our mail? I don't know what the HOA is doing as we just moved in and it's a rental. It's fine to pick up the mail here while it gets fixed. \n\nClerk: *barges in front of Manager* What's your name? Here. \n\nShe has the package I was there for. She scans it as delivered and flings it across the counter at me. I just said thank you and left. I could hear the manager ranting all the way to the back. ",

In total it took an hour and 25 minutes to go through, I spent the entire time being thankful I wasn't the cashier. \n\nDuring this wait, I was behind a guy who seemed like he was with 2 older women. They were chatting like they were best friends. And obviously since I was right behind them, I was waiting a fraction less of time than they were. \n\nAbout 40 minutes in this woman comes up with a FULL cart, like overflowing, talking to this guy and these two women about her success. I think she's just showing them, until she starts to slide the cart into the line up. \n\n&gt;Me: Uhm, excuse me? Are you waiting here now?\n\n&gt;Cart Lady: Yes. This is my husband he's been holding my place in line. \n\n&gt;Me: Well, me and the 20 people who are behind me have been standing here waiting in line. \n\n&gt;The Husband: I've been here for almost an hour waiting. \n\n&gt;Me: And so have I. Me and everyone else have been *waiting* not shopping around. \n\nCart Lady doesn't say anything else and I cross my arms and huff being *that* person. The husband asks her to go to the car and get their reusable bags, so she leaves.\n\n&gt;The Husband: Sorry, I have been waiting for a long time though. \n\n&gt;Me: Me too. And the entire time I thought I was waiting behind someone with 20 items, now it's 200.That's not fair to those of us who have to stand here and wait too. \n\n&gt;The Husband: Yeah, a lot of people have been doing it.\n\n&gt;Me: I don't care if you grab stuff while the line moves because you see something you want. But an entire cart is a little ridiculous. I have 30 items and I've been waiting my share of time, I would love to have someone stand here for me while I shop but that doesn't seem fair. \n\nThe lady ended up coming back at the hour wait- mark and she didn't go to the car to get bags, she went back to do more shopping and filled another half cart.\n\n&gt;Me (to myself but so they could hear): Are you serious? \n\nShe glanced at me and he asked her to *please* go get the bags.\n\nWhen we got closer to the register, he left me go ahead of him and he tried to small-talk with me. But she still said nothing, so it's her I hold the grudge to. \n\nIn my perspective, everyone wants a good deal but everyone also has to wait their turn in line. I've been butted before in the grocery store, where the wait is usually under 20 minutes and it's not like I can NEVER go back again. I would love to spend an hour and a half shopping and not have to wait in line as I'm sure we all would!\n ",

Me and my boyfriend had been referring to him in a similar name as 'tacoplacebro'.\n\nThe first time I met him was when I was going to get tacos with my boyfriend (going for tacos at a taco place, crazy right?)  Anyway he was super nice, polite, just on point.  Now I meet plenty of polite workers, but I rarely meet restaurant workers who don't have that soulless glint in their eyes.  It was pretty late at night and not busy, but tacoplacebro just totally struck up an easy conversation with us and we actually had a pretty good time because of him.\n\nThe second time was similar to the first, except it was in a busier part of the day, so we didn't talk as much.  Well, we ate, left, got home... aaaand I realized I didn't have my purse. Several things happened; I felt mixture of mortification (because we were at home and parked in the driveway) and I also felt panic.  So I drove back over there and had my boyfriend see if my purse was there because I was too ashamed to check myself and I had been crying, I mean theft isn't uncommon.  Well guess what?  Tacoplacebro had my back!  He had made sure my purse was safe when he found it while wiping tables down (like I said, he's on point) until one of us came back to get it.\n\nThird time was today.  It had been a while since I'd been to that taco place since I got laid off and broke up with my boyfriend, but today I went with my family.  I deal with anxiety a lot and today I've been feeling really apprehensive.  Well, tacoplacebro was working.  We acknowledged each other but I was with my family, so we didn't really talk.  Through the whole meal I guarantee I was visibly uncomfortable; honestly I felt almost claustrophobic in a sense being in public, I can't really explain it.  Sometimes I just get like that and can't help it.  Well, there's a little fish pond outside that taco place, and they give little containers of fish food pellets to kids who ask to feed the fish.  So my two sisters ran up front to ask; however, he gave them three containers.  Third container was for me.  So I thought, what the hell, why not.  But you know what?  I actually really enjoyed feeding the fish.  It was funny how they nommed for the food, I thought it was really cute!  That made me feel a whole lot better.\n\nSo thanks, Tacoplacebro, you know what?  You're a pretty swell dude.",

Do I donate money to a charity that provides therapy for emotionally battered customer service people? How can I fix this? Am I overreacting? \nAlso the guy I said the mean thing to had access to my address, so there's that.",

My mum and I had been shopping and were going to eat dinner at a relatively popular restaurant before going home. Because of an event, the restaurant was packed so we expected some waiting. Apparently the minute we walked through the doors, we were also bestowed upon us the power of invisibility.\n\nWe found a table upstairs with a good view of the restaurant, and was in no way seated in some corner that's easily overlooked. The menus were on the table so we looked through them and decided what to eat. Then we watched the waiter whizz to and fro for twenty minutes before he took our orders for drinks and food. The drinks arrived relatively quickly and we waited for our food. \n\nAs I said before, the restaurant was packed, and after about an hour the waiter came back and apologized for the long wait and said that the kitchen was in complete chaos. This was no problem at all, we were in no rush and was chilling after a day of shopping. We eventually got our food (it was amazing), and I had enough room for dessert. \n\nOrdering the dessert, however, seemed impossible. After about forty minutes of trying to get the attention of our waiter without being rude, he came back, took the basket with salt, pepper and different sauces, said he was \"just going to give this to another table, then come back\". He delivered the basket to the next table and disappeared.\n\nAnother thirty minutes went by before we managed to get the attention of another waiter who cleared our table of the empty plates and glasses and I managed to get a question in edgewise about the dessert. He said it was going to take just as long to get dessert as it took to get food, and he recommended that I not order anything else, so I asked for the bill instead.\nHe let another couple pay for their meal, walked towards us, took a 180 to chat with another table after which he finally made it to us, only to disappear to the next table over (they waived at him) before we got our bill. While we were paying he went back to the second table, sat down and talked to them, went over to the computer to fiddle with the music play list before he came back with a pen so we could sign the receipt and finally get out of there. \nIt was a lot of waiting, some of it understandable, some of it frustrating. \n\nHow does one go about getting the attention of a server? I usually try to make eye contact, and if that doesen't work I sort of raise my hand and say \"excuse me\" or something similar when they pass by my table. This obviously didn't work yesterday. I understand that they had a lot to do, but is it unreasonable to be able to pay or order dessert within half an hour after one is finished eating? Maybe I'm a douchebag, I don't know.\n\nTl; dr a long dinner, mostly spent trying to get the attention of our server. No cheesecake were had.",

If so, I simply won't keep ordering it.\" She explains that no, it's just having ongoing problems and she's about to try to fix it again.... I'm thinking \"ok, I get it. I manage retail too, and our systems are always crashing..\" \n\nSo they offer me something else -- an iced coffee.... By now, I'm starting to get a little grumpy, but ok... I ask the cashier what flavors they have.\n\nHe looks at his computer monitor, starts to tell me the flavors, and I can't hear him because he's talking away from me... I had to ask him twice to repeat himself, and he finally opens up the drive through window and yells at me \"DUDE!! I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU!! THE FLAVORS ARE _____\" \n\nHis blatant disrespect mixed with my early morning grumpiness didn't sit well.. I told him \"You don't have to be an a-hole about it\" and I started to drive away.... To which he replied \"F**K YOU!!\" which caused me to again reply to him with a big \"F**K YOU TOO!\" \n\nThis lovely exchange pissed me off so much that I decided to drive around, park my vehicle, and go inside... And I went off.... I walked up to the counter, and was immediately greeted by 2 managers and this same cashier... At this point, I'm yelling about how I don't appreciate the way he spoke to me, and that him yelling \"F**K YOU\" to me in the drive through isn't going to work for me.... \n\nThe manager kept trying to apologize for the frappe machine being down, which I was WAY beyond now... I tried to tell her that my problem was with her cashier, and his attitude.... \n\nSo then the cashier yells at me some more, because I called him an a-hole... Then he comes around the counter, ready to fight me.... Yes... he did the whole \"what are you going to do about it\" thug-type bit as to not allow himself to be emasculated by the likes of me.. \n\nI'm giving him the death-stare, but not raising my fists or any of that mess... I value my freedom, and today wasn't a good day to send him to the hospital, or to jail... \n\nLuckily, the manager got him to go to the back of the kitchen, and we discussed the problem. We both apologized, but she assured me that she now had to fire him because of the incident.. \n\nSo who's the real a-hole here??? Him or me?? I realize I had a big part in the verbal altercation, but he started with the disrespect and f-bombs, and he nearly got himself hurt and arrested by trying to fight me..",

        "text": "So firstly, I'm a retail employee at this very company, but I work at a different location. I personally hate cashiering as well, but I try to be super nice and friendly to all because that's what's expected of all of the employees.\n\nSo here's the story...\n\nI go shopping at this store and, before checkout, I ask my mom to give me the money so I can pay *and* use my employee discount. So I push my cart into a lane while my mom goes to look through a different department. \n\nThere's a couple ahead of me and when the cashier (I'll refer to her as Ms. R) scans their items, they mention that there's a coupon for $4 off the item (I think it costs $7). During training, I was told that it's okay to take the customer's word for it as long as it's reasonable (up to a $5 price change) and override the price that it scans as. Well, it did not seem that Ms. R has gotten that information. She tells them that the $4 was already taken off and $7 is the price. Now the 'coupon' is just a \"$4 off\" on the box by the manufacturer so it does seem that Ms. R is correct, *but* we are told to just make the customer happy if it's within range or call over a manager. Ms. R does not follow these rules. She argues with them for at least five minutes about the price while I place my items on the conveyor belt and wait. Finally, the customers decide to just leave with the item at $7 and I push my cart forward.\n\nAs I get all of my coupons ready and my payment ready, I make sure everything is ringing up as it's supposed to so I can get maximum savings. Ms. R rings up everything and it's all as it's supposed to be so I'm glad. It's about $30 so I hand over my gift card first that has ~$14 on it. Then Ms. R asks for another payment. I hand over the $100 bill I have and wait for change. She hands me the change and begins bagging the items. I frown as she places 3 half gallons of milk in one paper bag. I'm about to ask for another bag but I decide to just leave it as I have to make sure I have my employee discount and have all of my change. As I go to the end of the lane and look over my receipt, everything looks correct, then I begin to look at my change and realize. She gave me a hundred.\n\nThe change should've been ~$84 and she gave me back a hundred dollar bill *and* $56. I know how terrible one would feel if you gave back an extra $72 so I try to catch her attention saying, \"Excuse me? Uh, you gave me back...\" Then I notice, she's already checking out the people behind me. One of the people checking out tries to catch her attention as well but she continues scanning the items, oblivious to both of us. They finish their transaction and leave and I say it once again. \n\n\"Uh, excuse me, you gave me back a hundred.\" She finally acknowledges me and realized what I just said. \n\n\"Oh! Thank you for telling me,\" she said, as I handed the bill back to her. \"I must've given your hundred back,\" she said. I smiled politely as I waited for her to give me back the rest of my change but she just stands there and waits for any more customers (the lane is empty). \n\n\"Um, I need the rest of the money,\" I tell her politely. \n\n\"I already *gave* you the rest of your change,\" she said, a little rude. I frown and count out the money to myself then show her that she's only given me two twenties, a ten, a five, and two ones. \n\n\"I gave you a thirty (there's no such bill), a fifty, four ones,\" she snaps. I shake my head then show her the money again. She practically snatches the money away from me then goes back to the register to count it herself. She returns with what appears to be the correct change and counts it out to me as if I'm five years old. \"Fifty, seventy, eighty, four,\" she counts out, all slow like I don't understand the concept of numbers. Like ma'am, I'm wearing my uniform (came here after my shift at a different store), used an employee discount, *and* gave you back the extra change, please do not patronize me. I take the money and begin putting my bags in my cart but accidentally drop some change. As I bend down to pick it up, the lady rushes off and leaves her checklane. I go by the front and see that she went to the office and find my mom so I can go home. In the car, I tell her the story, and she just says that I should've gone to a different lane when I saw Ms. R's attitude with the couple in front of me. I mention that I'd already placed the items on the conveyor and sarcastically say \"What was I supposed to do? Take them back into my cart?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" my mom says and I shake my head and huff as we pull away. Suffice it to say that next time, I will definitely find a different lane.",

        "text": "Just went to and American fast food chain to get a yummy tea and some fries, the total was $4.43, so I initially thought maybe I could pay in coins instead of breaking the $20 bill I had which was my only cash. When I pulled up to the first window I was still counting my change when the woman in the window greeted me, and I told her I was just counting some change and only needed a minute. I soon realized I didn't quite have enough coins and reluctantly handed her my $20 bill which was folded up and in another compartment of my purse. \n\nTo my surprise the cashier handed me back only a few coins, to which I promptly and politely asked her for the rest of my change as I reeally would like the other $15... Also to my surprise was her reaction to this, which was to adamantly argue with me insisting that I had only given her a $5 bill and the change I received was correct. I happen to have only been paying for items the past few days with cash and was very aware of how much cash I had, not to mention had looked at the $20 bill as I handed it to her, so I was 100% positive the bill I gave her was a 20, and was not about to get talked out of $15. Thankfully the employee senses I'm not backing down (I remained polite throughout, however) and calls over her manager. I can see inside the window to the register and notice the $5 bill she is claiming I gave her is outside of the slot as well as a $20 bill!! \n\nThe manager seems torn and frustrated over the situation, as it really is just her word against mine, but she obliges me and tells her to give me the $15 change. As I pull away feeling relieved, I hear the cashier exclaim to her manager that if her register is off at the end of the shift she shouldn't be surprised.. and this got me wondering. \n\nDid the cashier pretend to be confused about the bill I gave her only to then take $15 out of the register for herself, knowing she now had an explanation for her register being exactly $15 short? I can only speculate... but either way I felt bad for causing trouble for her on the job. I remember being a cashier at my first job back in high school and giving the incorrect change/having a short register was really embarrassing! Has anyone else experienced this as a customer?",

        "text": "Never posted here before but felt like this experience may be worth sharing!\n\nMy birthday was last week, so on Saturday a few friends and I went downtown to a Mexican restaurant for frozen margaritas and dancing. \n\nWelp, we walked in and 1) the machine that makes the frozen margaritas was broken and 2) tables were sat so late that the dance floor couldn't be opened. I'm pretty easygoing and get that things happen, so I went up to the bar to order a margarita on the rocks. The bartender ignored me for a good 2-3 minutes, which is fine when it's busy, but there was one other customer. This person, as I got to overhear the bartender tell the bar-back while he was ignoring me, is apparently a \"big spender\" who tips really well. Sweet for the bartender I guess.\n\nAnyway, I got my margarita and the server brought us some guacamole, happy times. Except when I was sipping my drink and observed an inch-long cockroach scuttle up the wall, disappearing behind one of the mounted TVs. I was grossed out a bit, but I lived in NYC for three years and worked in a Times Square restaurant, so I get that it happens. \n\nThen, my friends came back from the bar looking ill because apparently a cockroach was on the bar *next to my friend's hand*! As they're telling me this, on cue, yet another huge cockroach goes scuttling along the floor next to our table. We got our checks and noped out of there.\n\nI e-mailed management directly in lieu of posting a negative review on Yelp or the like, since again I understand that this can happen at restaurants. He e-mailed me back today with an apology, said the spiel about \"I've hired a pest control company\", and offered free bottle service to me and my group.\n\nSo a very nice and appropriate response! However, I'm unsure how to respond back because I'm honestly just really turned off by the whole place. The place I worked at in NYC responded to pest complaints with the same line, and I never saw an exterminator - which of course isn't any indication of what this manager may or may not do - so I am skeptical. And it really wasn't a good experience overall, nor was it the two other times I've been there.\n\nAnyway, I haven't responded yet, suggestions welcome! I hope all of your future dining experiences are free of huge insects - unless you enjoy that sort of thing :D",

        "text": "Three tales. **First one** - *the Scheemer.*\n\nToday at the market I stepped in line behind an elderly woman who was just finishing her transaction. As the elderly woman left, I noticed the cashier (C) take an apple strudel out of the display case and take a bite out of it then slide it under the counter (obviously to finish later). I didn't think anything of it - I don't care if she snacks while she works -  but as I was in the middle of my transaction the elderly lady (EL) returned.\n\nEL: \"Excuse me... I think you forgot to give me my apple strudel.\"\n\nC: \"No, you didn't order one. If you'll wait for this gentleman I'll get one for you but you'll have to pay for it...\"\n\nEL: (holding out receipt) \"Yes, I ordered one, and I already paid for it. See? You must have forgotten to give it to me.\"\n\nMe: \"This lady was ahead of me. If you want to get her the strudel I don't mind waiting.\"\n\nThe cashier looked angry - poor thing, now she was going to have to pay for her own snack - and stomped like a child over to the display case to grab a strudel. Me and the old lady knew exactly what she had tried to pull and we smiled at each other. \n\n**Second one** - *the idiot.*\n\nI had to return something that had a part broken in the box. They didn't have the exact item, but had another item from the same manufacturer (less money) that had the part in it that I needed. After a few minutes of trying to explain the situation, a manager (M) nearby stepped in and approved the exchange. The idiot cashier (IC) did not understand the concept of exchanging one item for a different item. \n\nIC: \"I can't do this.\"\n\nMe: \"...your manager just approved it.\"\n\nM: (slight tone of disbelief) \"I just told you that you can do it.\"\n\nIC: \"But it's not the same thing.\"\n\nM: \"Exchange it as if it is the same thing.\"\n\nIC: \"Why doesn't he take it back to [totally different store] instead?\"\n\nThe manager and I exchanged incredulous looks at this point.\n\nMe: \"Because I bought it here and I have the receipt from here?\"\n\nIC: \"Oh. But I can't...\"\n\nThis went on for another twenty minutes before the manager told her to go do something else and made the exchange themselves. I was mildly amused that someone that stupid had gotten the job in the first place. \n\n**Third one** - *the blind.*\n\nI'm picking up pizza for the family and spot a six-pack of coke behind the blind cashier (BC).\n\nMe: \"Can I also have that six pack of coke?\" (pointing behind her)\n\nBC: \"Sure.\" She added it to my order, I paid, then she turned around and started pawing at all the drinks on the shelves. I watched her for a few seconds and then I helpfully (hopefully?) pointed out the six-pack. \n\nMe: \"It's right there.\"\n\nBC: \"I'm just trying to find you one that's all together instead of giving you single cans.\"\n\nMe: \"...Yeah. That would be... right... there.\" (pointing)\n\nBC: (sighs audibly) \"I TOLD YOU, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND YOU A SIX PACK THAT'S TOGETHER!\"\n\nMe: \"Uh... Ok. You have your hand on top of it.\"\n\nBC: \"Where... oh. Here you go.\"\n\n",

He declined. They also fired the **real** store manager and promoted someone else to store manager to discipline the first person.\n\nMy dad also reported the second incident to the district manager for the second chain (but keeps making excuses to not report it to the police), and they reviewed the security camera footage and moved the card reader so that it's right next to the window.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/3aojic/the_strange_tale_of_two_guys_i_knew/",
        "text": "Firstly I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit. I saw a post on Talesfromretail that reminded me of this story and I felt like I needed to share. But this story is more from a customers perspective so I figure this is the place for it. Secondly, I apologize for my wordiness. I know my stories are on the long side. But if you bear with me I think you'll find this to be a pretty funny story. \n\nAnyways. This was back like fifteen years ago when I was in college but it has to be one of the funnier stories I'd ever heard. So I've got to know these two guys who live in the apartment complex of a couple friends of mine. The apartment complex is small and everyone parties all the time so what would end up happening is we'd party at one apartment and migrate to another apartment for different \"party favors\". As a result pretty much everyone eventually hung out with everyone else in the whole apartment complex. This story concerns two of those guys. Names were forgotten due to said \"party favors\" and passage of time but I remember one dude was named John. But for the sake of the story we'll call them A and B. \n\nSo A throws a party. It's great. We end up with maybe 30 people crawling all over this really small apartment complex plus all the people there on a regular basis. A runs out of beer. Party slowly migrates to Person C's apartment because C always has beer. Party continues in such force at C's that he runs out of beer. B says he'll make a beer run. B notes that he doesn't have his wallet on him because he left it in his apartment. He does have beer money though because he just sold \"party favors\" to my friend. \n\nAt this point I feel it's important to note the following:\nA and B look like identical twins. They are not related in anyway. But it's kind of like a Gary Busey/Nick Nolte or Natalie Portman/Keira Knightly type thing where it's very easy to mistake one for the other especially if you're looking at a tiny license photo real quick that was taken years ago. \n\nAlso of note B is one of the biggest slackers I have ever met in life. So it came as a surprise to know one when B simply asked A if he could borrow his license rather than walk up one flight of stairs to his apartment for his wallet. A who only wants more beer gives B the license and B leaves for the store that is literally two and a half blocks away. We do not see B for another three days. The night of the party we get concerned he isn't back but then we remember that B is EASILY distracted. Day two we figure maybe he ran into a lady friend. Day three rolls around and we all go to our classes and we figure he must have done the same. Monday evening we're all chilling in my friends apartment listening to some Bob Dylan and B bursts through the door. \n\nEveryone is like: \"B!  What's up man where've you been, dude?\"\n\nB looks pissed stares straight at A and says \"what the fuck man, why didn't you tell me not to go to [specific corner store closest to the apartment complex]?!?\"\n\nA responds with: \"oh I'm sorry man. I thought you knew to go to [another specific corner store located about 8 city blocks away].\"\n\nEveryone at the little get together stops to stare at A. Obviously if a beer run is being made we are all thinking you go to the one two and a half blocks away and not the one he's talking about. A then senses that everyone at the party now agrees with B that they would have made the same mistake too. A tells B: \"well I'm sorry man I thought you knew about all that.\"\n\nEveryone else is like: \"A what's going on?\"\n\nA then proceeds to tell us that for for a couple of weeks two months ago he was buying beer with checks he knew would bounce but that by buying it on different shifts he was able to avoid getting caught because every time he pulled the stunt he did it with a different clerk. But he says the last time he went in he was going to do it again but when he went in he saw a copy of his face from a printout of the security camera with a big note to the employees that if they saw him they were supposed to confiscate his license and call the police. Shortly afterward a decided to do all his shopping at the store much farther away. \n\nB didn't know any of this and got picked up for bouncing bad checks. When he tried to straighten it out the charge was dropped but then he got charged with using a false ID. A then got charged with bouncing checks. \n\nTl;dr:  if you are B don't use A's ID to buy beer. If you are A you should not bounce checks for beer. If you run a convenience store by a major college campus you should probably not accept checks. ",

        "text": "Longtime lurker, first time poster and all that jazz (sorry for formatting and spelling errors; it's one in the morning).\n\nMy grandmother was driving me to the bookstore. She stopped at a very popular chain convenience store so I could go inside and pick up a newspaper so she had something to read while I was inside the bookstore.\n\nShe hands me $1.50 and I go inside, grab the newspaper, and go up to the cash register; the two cashiers are talking behind the counter. A bald man gets in line behind me.\n\n&gt;Cashier 1: *Rings up the newspaper* \"That'll be $2.50\"\n\n&gt;Me: *Face drops* \"Oh, shit. Can you watch my stuff? I need to get another dollar.\"\n\n&gt;Cashier 1: \"Sure. Not a problem.\"\n\nLeaving the newspaper on the counter with the $1.50 on top of it, I run outside, Granny gives me another dollar, and I head back inside, passing the bald guy that was behind me.\n\nAt this point, Cashier 1 is turned away from the counter and the money is gone; I assume that he put it in the register. I hand Cashier 2 the dollar.\n\n&gt;Cashier 2: *Confused look*\n\n&gt;Me: \"This is for the newspaper.\"\n\n&gt;Cashier 2: *Still confused look* \"The paper is $2.50.\"\n\n&gt;Cashier 1: *Turns away from what he's doing* \"That other money isn't there anymore?\"\n\n&gt;Cashier 2: No.\n\nThe three of us stand and stare at each other. I'm pissed and sad (more sad) that Bald Guy would steal $1.50 in quarters that he knew were not his.\n\n&gt;Cashier 1: *Waves his hand* \"Don't worry about it, dude. I got it.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Oh-oh my God. Thank you.\"\n\n&gt;Cashier 1: *Smiles the most beautiful smile I have ever seen in my entire life* \"Don't mention it.\"\n\nTL;DR: Cashier with a killer smile inspires me to be a better person.",

Since it's now mid-June, I wondered if any flowering plants might now be on clearance (after the big Mothers' Day/Memorial Day events are over.)\n\nTwo associates were chit-chatting at the entrance to the Garden Center; neither acknowledged my stop, with an empty cart, in front of them. \"Excuse me,\" I said nicely and politely, \"I'm sorry to interrupt, but can you tell me if any annuals or perennials are currently on sale?\"\n\n&lt;DEAD SILENCE&gt;\n\nFinally, one of them says, \"You can ask Kathy,\" gesturing with her head towards the back of the Garden Center. OK, being in retail, I figure \"Kathy\" is probably the Garden Center MOD. I thank the associates, and aim my cart towards the back. Nobody there. I'm figuring, OK, maybe it's her break time or she had to go to the bathroom, so I just browse around the plants for a while.\n\nTime passes, there's still nobody manager-ish appearing, but now I really can't hang around any longer since I have to drive home &amp; get showered and changed for my own retail job!\n\nSo I bought nothing. Seems to me, those sales associates in the front should have known the current sales/promos, right? Or maybe it was Kathy's responsibility to inform them, and she didn't? Who knows.  \n\nIn any event, everyone interacting with customers should know what's currently going on -- basic!  ",

        "text": "Sorry about formatting/spelling/grammar, on phone (if your reading this im probably already trying to format better so bear with me )\n\nThis happened earlier today while me and my dad were trying to get a printer repaired in warranty, saddly the warranty  was for exchange only and the store did not have any of this particular model in stock any longer, so after speaking with the only cashier (it was a slow day at this particular office supply store) we were given a merchant card and proceeded to examine available printers that would make an adiquate replacement. \nAfter much browsing and comparing we finally decided on a printer. Now to further the story let me explain about the printer box, it was cardboard but not assembled like i've normally seen boxes assembled. The cardboard was wrapped around the box like the box was assembled inside out, so there was a sharp edge at one corner of the box. \nAs luck would have it thanks to this exposed sharp edge, i managed to slice my hand open when picking up the box (whee! Large papercut) i immediately drop the box with the surprise feeling of pain, cursing slightly under my breath, and then lacking any means of stemming the bloodflow, and not wanting to make any more of a mess then i just had, i proceeded to cover my hand with my jacket sleeve and resume carrying the box to the cashier...small bloodsmear and all. \nupon reaching the cashier my father began paying for the purchase while conversing with the cashier. With the conversation going something like this\n\n&gt;Cashier ( c) : you found a replacement printer i see :) \nDad (d): we did, its ever better then the old one. \n(C): and almost the same price too (as she's tallying the total and its displayed on the screen).\n\nAll the while ive been examining my hand trying to get it to stop bleeding and at this point as my dad is presenting his money i decide to enter the conversation.\n\n(Pointing to the printer and small blood smear in particular)\n&gt;me(m) : well i dont like it at all, it bit me! There should be a discount! (Obviously joking)\n\nThe cashier was taken aback by this and at this moment realized the small blood smear and my hand and began stammering a little bit clearly not entirely sure how to respond\n\n&gt;(C) \"oh. What? Oh geez! Oh my umm yeah leme see what i xan do???\"\n\nWhile the cashier is trying to figure out something to say my father has finished processing the transaction on the debit machine (while trying to stiffle his laughter) and the register has already begun spitting out the receipt. Seeing that my apparent attempt at humor has been lost on the cashier i start trying to explain to her that its ok and i was joking about the discount and im not going to die of bloodloss from a paper cut and finally managed to calm the cashier down after a few minutes and managed to leave the store without causing any further distress to the employees. My dad laughing as we leave.\n\n",

After a week and a half or so, administration did something about it. They didn't fire her or hire a new receptionist, but what they did was just as simple and petty as her attitude; they posted a big neon yellow sign right on the base of her desk that says: \"If I treat you poorly, if I'm rude towards you or if I don't smile when I greet you, please report me in the office or call this number 55 1234 5678 and ask to speak to Ms. Jane Doe about my attitude. Thank you.\"\n\nIt is something almost childish and silly but it worked. I arrived today a few minutes early and her demeanor most definitely changed, she was being kind and polite to the point that she let me in at fifteen to eight and even wished me well when I was leaving the pool. \n\nA little and petty win for us the users.

I handed the teller my note sheet with the breakdown ($100 in 10's, $100 in 5's, $40 in quarters, $40 in dimes, $5 in pennies) and the $285. The teller starts counting the change and got all the rolls right but it seemed like she gave me too many 5's. My suspicions were confirmed when she counted 20 $10 bills instead of the 10 I needed and handed all the money over. \n\nShe had given me $200 in $10's, $185 in $5's and the correct rolled change. I was getting almost $200 more back than what I gave her! I told her what she had done and at first she didn't believe me but after recounting all the bills she took back the $185 and thanked me profusely. \n\nWhile it didn't even cross my mind at the time, I wonder what would have happened had I just taken the money. Do tellers get fired over that? I hope she was just having an off day and is more careful now.\n",

I freeze when I am nervous, and my boyfriend's reaction was to get out of there as soon as possible. Once we left my boyfriend and I agreed never to return there. I regret not complaining, but after it happened we just brushed it to the side and went on with our lives. \n\nA few months later my boyfriend and I are at the mall when we see the employee from the sex shop.

I order **10** more, I get **1** in my shopping cart.  \nIn a bad move on my part, I order combos of 5, then 3, each time getting only **1** voucher in my cart.  \nSo I try different combos and get 12 vouchers.  **12**.  I have the screen shot to prove it.  \nI use all 12 that same hour to book my Escape Room adventure, and call the coupon company to make sure I'm only charged for 12, letting them know their UI is wonky.\n\nThe wonderful service rep says: \n&gt;\"No problem! Read me the 12 you used and I'll make sure the rest are removed.\" \n\n______________________________________________\nMay 29, 10:36 - I get confirmation email I will receive refund in 2-3 days.\n\n___________________________________________\nAfter 3 days, I still see a looming $760 charge.   I'm nervous. I call again.  \n&gt;\"Don't worry! We had to run it by a manager, but he approved, and a refund is on the way. 2-3 days.\" \n\n___________________________________________\nI call 3 days later.  \n&gt;\"It's on the way!\"  \n\nAnother 3 days.  Nothing.\n______________________\nJune 2:  I get an email from the Director of Operations saying they **decide not to give me a refund**.  And will give me credit instead. $760 worth.  From a groupon like site.  **Because it's not their fault, but mine**.\n\nThis as AFTER they told me 3 times I'd get a refund.  Then the VP swoops in and reverses that decision.  Why?  I have no idea.  I didn't get the product.  You're not at a loss.  **Now they want me to spend $760 on their site in the form of credit??** WHAA?  So I email again to ask for my money back, saying and sending a screen shot that I never got 40 vouchers.\n__________________________________________\nThey email back, and there's progress. He'll give me HALF my money, and I only have to spend... $380 on their site.\n____________________________\nI email back:\n\n&gt;Hi,\n\n&gt;Thanks for the quick response.  Half refund and half credit is really, really not cool.\n\n&gt;1) I had issues with the website UI. Major lagging, the vouchers not going through, etc.   I never got more than 12 vouchers in my account, which is why I ordered one by one, trying different combos, until I got the full 12.

I want 10 apples. And they give me 9.  And I said. I want 5 apples.  And they give me 1.  And I keep ordering until they give me the 10 original apples I wanted.  Would they charge me for 40 apples I DID NOT receive, even if I asked for it originally until I got the 10 I wanted?\n---------------\n&gt;Look into your UI and back end systems.  Look into your shopping cart system.  Clearly something is wrong.\n\n&gt;But more importantly, look into your customer service. Because for a VP of operations to have a need to fight with a customer and put me in my place through passive aggressive quotation marks and and never once apologize is ridiculous.\n\n&gt;Which is a shame, because every single customer service rep was wonderful.\n_____________________________\n\nThey finally refunded my money, but I REALLY did not enjoy how this VP guy talked to me. \n",

I order 10 more, I get 1 in my shopping cart.  \nIn a bad move on my part, I order combos of 5, then 3, each time getting only 1 voucher in my cart.  \nSo I try different combos and get 12 vouchers.  12.  I have the screen shot to prove it.  \nI use all 12 that same hour to book my Escape Room adventure, and call They Who Shall Not Be Named to make sure I'm only charged for 12, letting them know their UI is wonky.\n\nThe wonderful service rep says \"No problem! Read me the 12 you used and I'll make sure the rest are removed.\" \n______________________________________________\nMay 29, 10:36 - I get confirmation email I will receive refund in 2-3 days.\n___________________________________________\nAfter 3 days, I still see a looming $760 charge.   I call again.  \"Don't worry! We had to run it by a manager, but he approved, and a refund is on the way. 2-3 days.\" \n___________________________________________\nI call 3 days later.  \"It's on the way!\"  Another 3 days.  Nothing.\n______________________\nJune 2:  I get an email from the Director of Operations saying they decide not to give me a refund.  And will give me credit instead. $760 worth.  From a groupon like site.  Because it's not their fault.\n\nThis as AFTER they told me 3 times I'd get a refund.  Then the VP swoops in and reverses that decision.  Why?  I have no idea.  I didn't get the product.  You're not at a loss.  You're just greedy.  Now they want me to spend $760 on their site in the form of credit?? WHAA?  So I email again to ask for my money back, saying and sending a screen shot that I never got 40 vouchers.\n__________________________________________\nThey email back, and there's progress. He'll give me HALF my money, and I only have to spend... $380 on their site.\n____________________________\nI email back:\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for the quick response.  Half refund and half credit is really, really not cool.\n\n1) I had issues with the website UI. Major lagging, the vouchers not going through, etc.   I never got more than 12 vouchers in my account, which is why I ordered one by one, trying different combos, until I got the full 12.

I pulled into one particular \"Popular Burger Chain\" location I'd never been to before. My first mistake was driving right past the order window, but since I was the only one in the drive-thru I just backed up with no problem.\n\nI ordered my food and paid at the next window like usual, but unfortunately for me I'm used to places with three windows for ordering, paying, and picking up. After I paid, I kept driving, expecting to see another window. After I realized that this was not the case, I had to back around the entire building to the second window where, sure enough, probably the entire restaurant staff was there pointing and laughing. My drive home was an hour of social anxiety and shame.\n\nTL;DR: paid for my drive-thru food and took off before I got my food, embarrassingly backed up to be laughed at by a bunch of the staff. ",

Its no problem, and everyone is friendly and polite. Everyone, that is, except for one cashier. \n\n\nShe kind of rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning, because she insists on calling me \"young man\". I know that she probably thinks thats nice, but someone I really dont like spent about 20 years calling me that as an insult, so it has some pretty negative connotations for me. I indured it for a few visits, but when it became clear that every time(and as many times per transaction as she could too. Hello young man, is that all young man? Your totals x young man heres your change young man have a good day young man) she saw me, she would call me this, I politely asked her to stop.\n\n  I said \"look, i know youre trying to be polite, but I dont like being called young man.\" Instead of apologizing or agreeing not to do it any more or even saying nothing, she frowned at me and said \"why? Thats what you are, isnt it young man\".  I don't owe her an explication. \n\n\nOnce, she asked to scan my rewards card for the gas station, and I handed her the one on my keys. She told me that I wouldn't be using that one, as they were phasing them out, and Id have to sign up for a new one. I was in a hurry that day so I said \"no thanks\" and reached for my keys. She then proceded to JERK MY KEYS AWAY FROM MY HAND. Hell no. Her face turned bright red as she said several more times that I needed the new card. We I again said no, she almost yeslled \"thats rediculous\"\n\n\nAnother time, there had been painters outside painting the front of the building, and they had a section of the sidewalk blocked off with caution tape. That woman was outiside angrly muttering to hersherself when I walked by. As soon as I set foot on the sidewalk (after walking around, not through the blocked off part) she exploded.  She yelled \"what are you doing, cant younsee theres paint?\" The painters called down that I was fine, since they weren't painting there. She turned around yelled up at them that she was trying to protect my clothes, and they should mind their own business.  Yeah, she really wanted to make sure i didnt get any paint on my already paint stained uniform. \n\n\nShes also in the past berated me for my choice of snacks, drinks, gotten angry that I didnt take advantage of a sale on a product I didnt want, and said that I had ruined my body, after she noticed I have tattoos.\n\n\nThe most recent incident was yesterday. As I was paying, she called me by my name, which she doesn't know. She saw my mame on my work shirt. I must have given her a sour look, because she just kindnof shrugged and said \"yeah, I hate it when stangers in public call be by my name because of the name tag.\"  What kind of psycho has anstranger do something to them that they dont like, and decides to do it to other people?  I agreeded saying \"yeah, its awkward.  I dont like it.\"  She then sneered at me and said \" well, if that's the worst thing that happens to you, youll have a pretty easy life\" she continued on, but at that point I just walked out the door.\n\n\nI always make sure to be as polite as I can in ever day life, especially people in the service and retail industry, because I've been on the other side of that counter, and I know how much anbad customer can suck. This woman is testing my patience though. Not sure how much more snide remarks And passive agressive behavior I can put up with.\n",

        "text": "Buckle up, this is a long one.\n\nTL;DR Three flats in 8 months, both replacement tires were defective, but [Auto Shop] is now asking me to pay for a new one.\n\nWe begin our story in October of 2014 (~8 months ago). I was driving to a local bar to see a friend's band perform, when my driver's side back tire blew out. Loud explosion, scared the crap out of me, etc. I pulled into the first parking lot I saw to try to figure out what the hell had just happened (I had never had a tire shred on me before, did not know what to expect based on the sound alone). I saw that my tire was bad, and thought, \"Ok, I have a spare and a jack. I can fix this.\" \n\nNope. Whoever had replaced the existing tire had tightened the lug nuts so much that I could not loosen them. I had to call a friend to help (I stupidly didn't have my AAA card with me), and the only way he was able to get them off was by carefully standing on the wrench and bouncing on it (which I had also tried, but tiny female=not going to happen). We managed to wrestle the rest of the lug nuts off and swap out the bad tire for my spare.\n\nI managed to find some time to visit [Auto Store] later in the week, bought a new tire, had it mounted and balanced and everything. I also specifically asked them if it was possible for them NOT to use a pneumatic wrench to tighten the lug nuts (and to loosen the ones on my other three tires) and to just use a regular torque wrench. This was so that if I had another flat, I wouldn't have to call a friend or, god-forbid, a tow truck just to swap out a tire. I can do that shit myself, I shouldn't have to call someone to do it for me. [Auto Store employee] says, \"Sure, absolutely! No problem!\" Great! I paid for my new tire and went on my merry way.\n\n\nFast-forward to January of this year (~6 months ago). I was on my way home from work and I noticed my car was acting a little funny. Pulled into my complex, checked the tires, lo and behold, the same tire I had just replaced was flat (no explosion that time though, so that was a plus). Well shit. I took out my equipment, tried to loosen one of the lug nuts, it didn't budge. Tried a different one. Nope. Tried a different tire. Nadda. Those assholes lied to me. They used a goddamn pneumatic wrench to replace the last tire and didn't even bother with the rest of them. Had to call AAA to come out and help me get the damn flat off my car (thank you, Dad, for keeping up the family's membership). They looked at the flat, didn't see any obvious damage, so they pumped it back up to find the leak. Turns out it had a bad valve that was splitting at the seam. \n\nWith the spare safely on my car, I drove back to [Auto Store]. I told them that they had sold me a defective tire and I needed it replaced, and that I needed them to follow through this time and make sure that the lug nuts weren't on too tight. \"Sorry about the tire and you not being able to get it off, we'll replace it for you, no charge, and take a look at those lug nuts while we're at it!\" Fantastic. Took them a while since they were a little backed up, so by the time they were finished, I was well on my way to being late for work. Meaning I forgot to check the lug nuts before I left (you see where this is going, right?).\n\n\nFast-forward (last time, I promise!) to yesterday night. I was driving home from work again when my car started being stupid. I thought, \"Goddamn it, not this shit again.\" Pulled into my complex, lo and behold, the SAME GODDAMMN TIRE was flat. I tried to get it off, and lo and behold, they had once again tightened them down so much that I almost bent my torque wrench out of shape.\n\nGot up early this morning to try to resolve this crap. Went back out to my car to take a look at the tire and try to figure out what happened. The valve was cracked open in so many places that I'm surprised the tire lasted as long as it did. The sidewall was split open too, but I think that was just from driving on it with low air pressure. Called [Auto Store] to explain that they had once again sold me a defective tire, and that once again, I was not able to get the damn thing off myself (I had to call AAA again to swap it out for my spare). \n\nThe guy said that they were sorry I had a flat but they would have to measure the amount of tread left and could only give me a small discount on a new tire based on that. It's not their fault I got a defective tire! When asked about the lug nut issue, he replied with \"We are required to tighten them to a very specific degree. We can't let any car drive off our lot with lug nuts any looser than that.\" Then why the hell wasn't I told that the last two times? Your asshole coworkers lied to me when they said that they could! \"I'm very sorry about that, but there's nothing I can do.\"\n\nGod. Fucking. Damn it.",

        "text": "For the last two years I was on contract with a certain lunar type of phone. I sent it back to be repaired countless times, because it randomly crashed, deleted apps, turned itself off, and was generally annoying. Each time the factory said they could find nothing wrong, and did a factory reset.\n\nWhen I went to re-contract in March, I couldn't decide between the same brand but more music based, or a Schnapple. I like the bigger screen and the ability to add in a microSD, but I had more faith in the Schnapple after my previous experiences. I was told the Blote ran on different software than its lunar predecessor, and wouldn't have the same problems.\n\nI got the Blote.\n\nSince then I've sent it back once and been given a replacement handset, and I'm now trying to send it back again for the same reason - it does all the same things the lunar one did. When I went right to the top of the carrier's complaints section, they asked why I went with the same manufacturer if I'd had so much trouble before?\n\nBECAUSE YOUR STAFF TOLD ME THIS ONE WAS DIFFERENT!\n\nYesterday I went into the store to order a replacement handset. I was told to go home and ring for an insurance claim number, even though it's not insurance, it's a warranty issue. So I rang the number, got a claim number, and rang it through to the store.\n\nThen the carrier rings me back and says I don't have insurance. After arguing with them for a bit, they say I don't need insurance, as it's a warranty issue. I KNOW! I'M DOING WHAT I WAS TOLD!\n\nSo now I hafta go back to the store, and convince them to do their jobs properly. Awesome.",

        "text": "Howdy, folks.  I've decided to share one of the more depressing company dealings I have had.\n\nMost of my life my mother was ill to some degree.  You know how on that TV show it's never lupus?  For her, it was, before many people had even heard of it.  And then it was more than just lupus, she got diagnosed with two other serious diseases that I will not name in case people I know are redditing around (because it's quite rare to get lupus and one of the other illnesses, apparently - but I digress).  \n\nWhat it boils down to is that, before she turned 50, she was pretty much bedridden or in a wheelchair.  She had an oxygen machine that she used while home and little tanks to use while she was out.   Because the O2 machines are costly and require regular maintenance, renting was the best option.\n\nSadly, my mom passed away in 2004.  Almost immediately, my father got rid of everything he could of hers (his way of coping, I think).  Returned the rented hospital bed (tossed the mattress because that you bought), gave away the wheelchair and some other things.  Returned the oxygen machine and the bottles.  \n\nSo several months pass, life goes on.  One day the house phone rings so I answer.  The names are changed to protect the moronic.  My mom's name will be \"Mom\" because why change what works?  Though the lady calling used her real name.\n\n&gt;Phone lady: Hi!  This is Debbie from Impolite Hospital Supplies, how are you today?\n\n&gt;Me: Uh...fine.  What can I do for you?\n\n&gt;Debbie: I'm just calling to find out when is a good time to come out and service Mom's oxygen machine and check the tanks.\n\n&gt;Me: Uh, yea, we no longer have the oxygen machine or tanks as my mother passed away in February.  \n\n&gt;Debbie: Oh I am so sorry.  I just get a memo pop up on my computer of people to call about servicing their equipment.  \n\n&gt;Me: Well, you might want to change that.\n\n&gt;Debbie: Oh absolutely.  I will not it here and we will remove her name from the list.  Again I'm so sorry [blah blah apologies and condolences]\n\nSo I was glad I didn't lose my temper and glad I handled it and life went on.  About six months later, the house phone rings and I answer.  Guess who?\n\n&gt;Phone lady: Hi!  This is Debbie from Impolite Hospital Supplies, how are you today?\n\n&gt;Me (feeling my temper flare up a tiny bit but I figure it could be a different issue): Yes?\n\n&gt;Debbie: I'm just calling to find out when is a good time to come out and service Mom's oxygen machine and check the tanks.\n\n&gt;Me: Hi Debbie.  We had this discussion 6 months or so ago.  My mother is dead.  We no longer have the equipment here.  \n\n&gt;Debbie (sounding genuinely mortified): Oh I am so sorry!  I remember talking to you and I thought I had deleted this account.\n\n&gt;Me: Yes, well apparently you didn't.\n\n&gt;Debbie: Oh I will now I'm so sorry.  \n\nSo I get off the phone and bitch to my gf for a bit but, again, life goes on.  Until about six months later.  Phone rings.  Guess who?\n\n&gt;Debbie: Hi!  This is Debbie from Impolite Hospital Supplies, how are you today?\n\n&gt;Me (now at this point I am dead on angry): Debbie, I'm seriously wondering if you do not want me to forget my mother's death (it truly almost felt this way, it was so surreal).  Mom is still dead.  We still do not have the equipment any more.  You said you'd take care of this twice already and obviously you haven't.\n\n&gt;Debbie: Oh my God, I just realized I called you again...\n\n&gt;Me: Yea.  I want to talk to a supervisor because, apparently, I need to find someone who can actually delete a [bleeping] phone number from your [bleep bleep] system.  \n\n&gt;Supervisor: Hi this is Lisa.  How can I help you?\n\n&gt;Me: Debbie didn't tell you how she's been calling me every six months since my mother died on [date] to service the machines we have not had since a day after her passing?\n\n&gt;Lisa: Oh no.  I am so sorry, ma'am.  \n\n&gt;Me: I lost my temper with Debbie just now but it's frustrating.  I just want to move on and Impolite Hospital Supplies seems unable to let me do that.  \n\n&gt;Lisa: I assure you, we are not trying to do that.  I will delete this name and number from our system\n\n&gt;Me: I've heard that before.  \n\n&gt;Lisa: I am so sorry.  I assure you, it is now deleted.  If you get any more calls, please ask for me immediately.\n\n&gt;Me: Let's hope I never have to. \n\nAnd, thankfully, I didn't hear from them again.  But it was, by far, the most messed up interaction I have ever had with any company.  It got to the point in the final call I was on the verge of crying.  Partly because I cry when I lose my temper but partly because every phone call from this company was a stinging reminder that my mom was gone.  I apologize for how long this is.  It feels good to get it out, though.\n\n**TL;DR** Mom dies.  Debbie needs better training.  Lisa delivers on her promise.  Spastix loses her mind but finds it later hiding under the bed.",

Today I noticed on my bank account statement that they charged us $5.36 more for those purchases. Somehow their system messed up and gave us a bigger discount that we should have gotten and this was their way of correcting the error. I was given no notice that this was going to happen and if I hadn't called them first, I would have called my bank and said that those two charges were in error (I'm still thinking about doing this).\n\nIf your system causes an error, that problem should always favor the customer.

We stopped at a chain diner for breakfast.\n\nI'm not a coffee drinker, and I saw that they had hot tea on their menu.  I wasn't expecting anything fancy, just a basic Lipton teabag and hot water.\n\nWhen I ordered, the teenage waitress asked me to repeat myself.  Twice.  When she came to drop off the coffee for someone else at my table, she told me that my Hi-C would be up in just a moment.\n\nI figured she must have misheard me, so I explain that no, please, I'd like hot tea, not Hi-C.  She stared at me for a long moment before heading off into the kitchen.\n\nWhen she dropped off my drink, I was confused.  The mug was warm and the tea was already made.  I took a sip and almost spit it out, it was so sweet.  A light bulb went off--the waitress had no idea what hot tea was, so she took sweet tea (true tooth-achingly sweet Southen style) and microwaved a mug for me.\n\nThe place was busy so there was no natural way to stop her and explain hot tea to her without sounding overly bitchy and patronizing, and I really just thought the entire thing was funny.  I hope she explains to another waitress the \"strange\" person that ordered hot tea, and that they tell her how to prepare it!",

        "text": "(Approx. 4-6 weeks ago)\n\nI work at a large retail store. Within this large retail store is a fast food restaurant that serves sandwiches, pizza, and other stuff. I head over here during my lunch break. It's been a stressful day so far for me, my throat's in desperate need of a cold soft drink, and my tummy's in desperate need of something good to eat. From this point out, I will be referred to as Me.\n\nSo, two people working there. One's about my age (young, straight out of high school). He's only been there for a week, and is new to everything that this sandwich shop has to offer. He will be referred to as NG, or New Guy. The other is maybe 4-5 years older, and is showing him how to do everything. She will be referred to as GL, or Generic Lady.\n\nThe customer ahead of me is another associate at the store I work at. He's an older gentleman, and will be referred to as OD, or Old Dude. Apparently, GL made some kind of remark to NG regarding his pizza getting burnt, and OD got mad at GL. OD asked for GL's name, and stormed out of the store. GL left, I assumed to vent or have a smoke break because she was upset, but it turned out he was looking for OD to apologize.\n\nAnyways, that's the back story. Now, NG is all by himself, and I'm ready to order some food.\n\nMe: Alright, I'll try to make this easy on ya. I'll take a personal pepperoni pizza, please.\n\nNG: Alright! Well... I actually don't know how to make one. [sarcasm] Gee, it would be nice if someone were here to show me how [/sarcasm].\n\nSo, what he asked me now is if I knew how to make one. I've watched other people make them before when I was here, so I decided, what the hell, I'll do it.\n\nSo, going strictly off of memory, I show this dude what to do. From removing the plastic off the premade pizza crusts, to putting the correct toppings on, to toasting it for the proper amount of time, and serving it in the box. So, he shows it to me, and I'm like, yeah, looks good. So, get a drink and some chips to go with it, pay for my order, and go to get a drink and sit myself at a table.\n\nI didn't mind doing all of this, really. I'm fairly easy going and all, and the amount of time I'm given on my lunch break is quite generous, so it was fun doing all of that. I also felt bad for him because his trainer basically abandoned him.\n\nBut, the best part was that when I sat down at the table, I realized that I forgot to ask him to cut it. When I looked up at the counter, he had a line, and I'm just kinda socially awkward like that and didn't want to interrupt him to cut it, so I just sat there eating a whole fucking pizza. It was kinda awesome.\n\nMade sure to take the survey on the receipt and praised him. I haven't seen him since, so he might be gone.",

        "text": "To start my parents bought a week long package trip as a  wedding gift for my now wife and I. We picked out and bought the trip as a package deal online through a travel website back in October of 2014. We were very careful about finding out exactly what we needed to bring with us (ID's, Credit Cards in my name, etc.). The only thing we were told we needed was a license and a credit card in the name of the driver on the package. This was confirmed by both the website I bought the package from and rental car company itself.\n\nFast forward to June 1st 2015 we arrive in Maui and go to the rental car place to get the car. That's where the problems started. My father used his credit card to pay for the package so for some reason it was under his name and not mine, despite me putting my name as the driver and renter on the package deal through the website. We explained that they told us we would only need my credit card and ID. The lady that was helping us told us that their policy had recently changed so whoever bought it had to be the one picking it up. Yet they still refused. So my wife, keep in mind we had been traveling for 12 hours already, were forced to either stand and complain or just rent another car. So after another 30 minutes of arguing we just rented another car. Through our package the rental car cost 217 but we had to pay 685 out of pocket to get a car.\n\nFast forward to today and I have been in contact with both companies. We contacted the rental car company a few different times because every person we talked to was incredibly rude and wouldn't even listen to our problem. They also told us there was no policy change which contradicts what they told us at the location on Maui. We eventually got put on a call back list for a supervisor. The travel website was willing to repay the 217 but we obviously want the rental car company to reimburse us for essentially forcing us rent another car at 685 or be stuck at the rental car place.\n\nI don't know who's at fault the travel website or the car rental company but it seems to me that its the rental car company. I will never use them again and I will hopefully get some kind of actual resolution here soon.\n\nEdit 1: To clarify the package deal was 2800 for hotel flight and car. 217 was for the car. When my father bought it both the rental car company and online travel sight told me I only needed my I'd and credit card. \n\nEdit 2: Still waiting for a call from a rental car supervisor. However I still havent figured out if the policy actually changed or not. Won't know more until the supervisor calls.\n\nFinal Edit: After multiple calls to the customer service for the rental car company I've given up. We talked to 2 different people ans they were both incredibly rude. To top it off thwy refused to answer our questions or tell us why this happened especially after telling us they can't divulge any of their policies over the phone. They told us that we weren't talking them into anything so unless we needed something else they were going to hang up. Ots all complete bullshit and I wish I could tell you who it was so no one would ever have to go through what I did. I will never be using them again.",

We decided to stop at the hot deli quick before I started, as we were both fairly hungry. We stand in front of the case looking, deciding, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.... Finally after about 3 minutes the deli clerk comes sauntering up from aisle 7 with a packet of chips in her hand. She is rocking what can only be described as \"bitch face\". From the other side she stared at us, until we realized that that was our cue to order, which we did, only to be met with silent scooping. All through the order and checkout she couldn't even muster one word or non-scowl. After we finished eating, my SO left and I started work.\n\n\nLater that evening the store manager walked by and asked how I was. I never, ever, complain. But for some reason, the way that this clerk had treated me, a coworker, today made me wonder how she was treating the customers of our store. So I told the manager what I saw. A week later I overheard that she was out of work and **PISSED**. Apparently this wasn't the first complaint about her attitude. Oops :/ /s",

        "text": "I was shopping this morning when I had an experience my mind still cannot quite process.  \n\nThe store I went to was rather slow, being a monday morning, with maybe 3-4 other customers in the whole store. It was nice and quiet, just as I prefer my shopping to be.  \n\nWhile finishing my shopping and making my way over to the registers, I thought for a moment i can feel the ground beneath my feet shaking. Ok, actually I heard the huffing and puffing behind me and the speed those sounds were closing in, so I took a step to the side, and not a moment too early.  \n\nA really BIG guy, easily 200 pounds, rolls by and cuts in line in front of me, a sixpack of soda in each hand.  \nOk, I thought, just another idiot without manners, whatever and line up behind him. Didn't prepare me at all for the storm that was going to ensue.  \n\nSo our big friend puts both of his sixpacks on the counter, gets rung up and told the total. By then he realizes, he doesn't have enough money with him. Where every normal person would apologize, get out and get some more money, Big Guy decided to go through the 5 Stages of ardous customers.  \n\nYou know:  \n* Apologizing (though this step is most often skipped)   \n* Bartering (skipped very often too)  \n* Arguing (now we're talking, aye?)  \n* Demanding a manager (only to learn the guy ringing him up IS the Store Manager)  \n* Exploding into rage  \n\nNow, I've seen my share of pointless quarrels held by customers, even ended some abuse towards retail employees. But O'boy, *this* was a first. Big Guy did not just explode. Normally, this would involve yelling, cursing, throwing stuff on the floor and some such.  \n\nNo Sir, this dude turned full Hulk on the poor guy at the till, grabbing one of his sixpacks, yelling something along the line of \"You want to keep this!? Here, have it!\" and swinging it like a mace, right into the face of the cashier. Who of course gets thrown out of his seat and over the railing of his cubicle (or whatever it is called), landing HARD and knocked unconcious instantly.  \n\nSeeing this, Hulk-Guy hesitates for a moment, putting his soda back on the counter and making a waddle towards the door. Now, in my head,  I'm torn between two options. First, I feel like i should intercept the guy so the police can get their piece of this cake too. Second, and on the other hand, the cashier is not only still unconcious, but bleeding from a broken nose. While lying on his back. Not good.  \n\nBecause the store was so slow, most other employees are in the back of the store and out of reach, so I did what was hopefully the right thing, and stepped to the cashier, got him in recovery position and applied a bit of first aid (napkins, yay) to stop the bleeding, while somehow calling the ambulance.  \n\nTill now the story sounds like some kind of ego-bullshit, I acknowledge that, but here's where it gets a whole new level of Alien^tm. The Hulk actually comes back. No, not to help or anything, but demanding to know why I help the *still* unconcious person lying in a small puddle of blood on the floor. Yes, he **demanded** to know why I **dare** to help that dude.  \n\nI was shocked. My mind still tries to process \"How can someone seriously injure another person and try to prevent any help given to his victim\". I can't. I...he... I just can't. At that moment I snapped. I turned, on my knees, towards that mountain of a human, and yell at the top of my lungs. Nothing coherent, just a primal yell. After that there's a bit of a blur in my memory, continuing when the paramedics arrive (the cashier apparently woke up by me yelling, so theres that).   \n\nAnd the kicker? Hulk-Guy still stood there, in a corner, white like the wall behind him. He still stood there when the police arrived to carry his big butt out of the store. The other employees related to me I just kind of knelt in a pounce like pose and actually growled at the Hulk. One (female) employee compared it to an animal protecting its litter. I dunno, I was out.  \n\nBut still, where do they get those idiots, and how do we end that supply?",

Hundreds of restaurants across dozens of chains have happily told me what kind of oil they're using and whether or not they have any nuts in the kitchen. Hell, some have even started printing guides with all the information an allergic person (or anyone with dietary restrictions) could need.\n\nAnd then I went to Local Sandwich Chain.\n\nLocal Sandwich Chain is only in a couple states, but I've eaten at their other locations before. Sometimes different locations will service different menu items, so I need to re-verify with every location I eat at. And the other ones haven't had any problem with me.

It's a liability. And it's also a liability if you eat here, so I can't serve you now.\"\n\n\"Wow, that's...I've never heard that before. You really can't tell me?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I would actually be breaking laws if I told you what's in our food.\"\n\n\"Well, what if I told you what I'm allergic to? Could you tell me if it was safe?\"\n\n\"Nope. Just assume you can't eat here.\"\n\n\"But your other locations were able to tell me.\"\n\n\"That's not good. They shouldn't have done that. But I can't serve you now.\"\n\nI'm pretty sure there's no law against it, but she wasn't exactly inspiring confidence, and I was late to meet up with my friends anyway. So I left.

We chose to go to a pizza restaurant that also serves great beer and burgers.   \n\nWe arrived and were seated immediately and we started to peruse the menu.   Our server arrived and was a very young boy.  My son does not understand boundaries or personal space.   So when the server arrives my son stands up and says \" I want to hug you \"  and proceeded to hug and kiss the server.   We were mortified and apologized profusely.   The server was so happy and hugged him back.   \n\nThen for the rest of our dinner the servers were EXTRA attentive and came by our table very frequently refilling our half empty cups and just finding non reasons to stop by and of course every time my son was overjoyed to give another hug.  I think four waiters came by just for hugs.  After about the sixth time our original waiter came by and said the staff would like to give us free desert.  \n\nHowever, sweets that late would keep lys up all night and we declined.   The staff was obviously visibility disappointed and I felt like a jerk.   We explained the reason and left a very large tip.  \n\nAnyways, I just thought it was awesome how well they took an awkward situation and made it into a good thing.   So thanks servers and lys will always have hugs for you even without ice cream.",

I have been shopping here for the last 6 years or so and have never had a bad experience aside from today.\n\nJimmy was very slow to checkout the person in front of me, but I thought \"hey maybe something was messed up.\" So I waited. Took about 5 minutes. My experience went downhill from there.\n\nFirst I asked for delivery ( I know the $40 rule, no problem as I had about $80 worth of groceries). He responded decently to this, outlining the rule. About 6 minutes went by and he was finally done scanning my ~20 items. He then asked me \"if I have a cart\", and then after saying no he went over to go grab one. When he got back with it, he turned to me and was like \"The groceries. Put them in the cart\". I said \"excuse me\" thinking I misheard him and he repeated the same thing. I asked him if they have anyone to do this, as that is a rather rude thing to ask a customer to do. He then acted confused and said \"I mean.... I can... but it will take a while\". Which I can't disagree with given his poor display of work so far.\n\nNow I hope this is Jimmy's first day at the job and this will be a funny story later on, but as a customer I am asking for this to be brought to management's attention as this type of customer service is unacceptable and outright appalling.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMike\n\nP.S. Despite Jimmy's offer for a job to be a bagger, I respectfully decline.\n\n\n**TLDR** Jimmy, a (hopefully) new and Asian cashier asked me get a cart, bag up my own groceries and place them in the cart for him. This is appalling customer service. I called in and spoke with Rachel, she was a very professional and articulate young woman and was a pleasure to speak with and handled the situation perfectly.\n",

Our plane was a couple of hours delayed even getting to Toronto, so we missed our connection through no fault of our own. Obviously this happens, it can't be avoided with something as complicated as air travel. Yeah, it sucked, we had already paid for a \"romantic package\" at a beautiful Madrid hotel, which we were now missing 1/2 of (since we are only there two night). But what can you do, we weren't too frazzled at this point.\n\nUpon arriving to New York, a lovely and compassionate AA lady rebooked us for a flight 24 hours later. And that's it. She said she was not allowed to give us neither food comp nor accommodation - we were expected to stay in the airport for 24 hours. We asked to speak with her supervisor who was much, MUCH less compassionate than her, and treated us like pests. His best offer was a \"free phonecall\" (since there are no more payphones at JFK terminal 8, they've all been disconnected), and he even got angry at the lovely lady for giving us slightly better seats on the new flight (not first class or anything, just the ones with more legroom), and reprimanded her about it. What. The. Hell. The only pleasant interaction we had with AA all day resulted in the employee being reprimanded.\n\nSo far hotel has cost us 180 US + cabs back and forth to the airport + ridiculously overpriced airport food, etc. Due to the checkout time (11 am) and our new flight time (7:15 pm) we STILL have to spend 8 hours at an airport, even after paying for our own hotel.\n\nI've been on at least 5-6 delayed flights in my life where I missed my connection through no fault of my own, and I have NEVER not been given overnight accommodation by any other company. Even as recently as January of this year, I was back in my old home in Bulgaria and missed my connection in Milan when coming back to Canada. I was flying with Bulgaria Air, clearly much poorer and less prestigious than American Airlines, and even THEY comped me with a hotel room and 3 full meals in Milan. It blows my mind that one of the most profitable airlines in the world, AA, treats their clients like this, especially at a very important time like our honeymoon. I am both sad and pretty disappointed. I would never fly with them again, nor recommend anyone to fly with them, ESPECIALLY any flight with a layover.\n\nSo please, make sure you book with a better company (I've been comped by Bulgarian Air, Alitalia, Czeck Airlines, Lufthansa before, they're all good! as I'm sure are 90% of other companies), and safe and enjoyable travels!",

I am crying from frustration and need to vent or find a way to fix this issue.\n\nSo, I am currently awaiting delivery of a very important parcel from the United States (I live in Canada). The sender of this parcel decided to mail it via a company that sounds oddly like You Pee Mess. The online tracking for my package is stellar; I get updates at least once per day on where it is and recent activity involving the package, as well as email updates. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I have experienced with this company.\n\nI was supposed to receive the package today; I worked until mid-afternoon, so I went to the house where I requested it be sent to (not where I am currently staying). I waited for a couple of hours, but couldn't spend much time there, so mildly disappointed I went back home and waited for an update. The tracking website showed that it was returned to their office and that they would try again tomorrow, but with no estimated delivery time. I work incredibly variable hours, so it is nearly impossible to expect to be home at the same time as the delivery driver comes by, so instead I looked at the slip they gave me for more information. That is how I found out that they expected me to pay a $100 fee upon delivery (I'm guessing duty, but not certain), which they had never given me any notice about. If I had been there when the driver came, I would have had to have $100 ready to pay in an instant without even a heads up that I would be charged for such an amount. \n\nMiffed, I went online to see if I could arrange to pick up the package at their office instead, to eliminate the guesswork of delivery. The series of steps the website took me through to do this took me around in circles, back to the tracking page, without having done anything and with no way to fix it. The slip mentioned that I could call to do this, so I dialed the number. I heard the dial tone, then complete silence for a full minute. Not even a ring.\n\nSeriously frustrated, I went back to the website to see if I missed something. The walkthrough for arranging to pick it up at the office told me that there are buttons with one of a few options that I should have selected; I went back to try again and lo and behold, none of the buttons work. I noticed that there is another option to sign up on their website to do this more easily, so getting a little desperate, I filled out the form and submitted it. The next page then told me that I would receive an email confirmation code...within 2-5 business days.\n\nBy now I was really angry (even giving my friend a running commentary of my efforts), but I decided to once more try the option that had me going in circles on their website. I selected the same button to start the process, but after having tried to sign up for their dysfunctional website, a pop-up window appeared telling me that the primary account holder must log in to be able to do this. I am the only one on this new account, and I am logged in.\n\nI'm completely fed up already. This is a hugely known and widespread shipping company; you would think that at least one aspect of their service would work at all. But nothing seems to.\n\n**TL;DR - Huge company fails in all but tracking and expects me to sit around the entire day and be ready to give them lots of money without notice, with nothing I can do to change it.**\n\nEDIT: I tried all options again today, none of which seemed to work. On my third try with the phone line, I actually got through to the automated voice prompts. They still didn't help and only disconnected me when I said the problem hadn't been solved. Thankfully my mom was home to receive the package today, or else this would have been even more of a nightmare.",

        "text": "Hello, y'all!! Just another little short tale about the wonderful customer service in Mexico.\n\nHere in Mexico (and maybe in other places?) it becomes very evident when somebody hasn't had a responsibility before. They get very high up there and treat you miserably and act like they're doing you a favor, even if their job is something very small and simple. \n\nAfter finally subscribing to my swimming classes, I finally started this week and they instructed me to come 10 minutes early to rinse off, put my things in a locker and other things they tell you to do before jumping in the pool. \n\nWhen you arrive, there's a woman at the front desk and you have to hand her your swimming ID and she keeps it until you come out and gives it back to you again, very nice and easy, right? Apparently not so.\n\nI arrived ten minutes early, greeted her and handed her my ID and this happened:\n\n&gt; FDLady: Oh, you have to be here at 10 before 8:00 a.m.\n\nI checked my clock and it already was that time.\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, isn't it already 10 to 8?\n\n&gt;FDLady: No, it's 11 to 8. Wait a minute over there *(pointing to the door)* and I'll call you.\n\nSo I did... And lo- and behold, after a minute she let me in.\n\nI thought that maybe she was in a bad mood or her day was going wrong so I let it go, but the same occurrence kept happening until today, when she decided to be a generous Goddess. I greeted her as always and she said:\n\n&gt;FDLady: There's still a minute until 10 to 8, but I will let you in just this time, OK?\n\nI didn't know whether to laugh or just ignore her, so I just nodded and went ahead. Not too bad, but my dear goodness is she petty.\n\n",
