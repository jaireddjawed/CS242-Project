And why is it so terrifyingly effective? Its almost as if that there need be no substance to any counterargument because of already established argot, however I am puzzled how this has almost became a meta-meme, a successful usage of previous outdated memes to illustrate a particular point. Perhaps it is related simply to the fact terms like this were once so commonly used on the forum that it is used to refer to naivete- that the redditors fear of being the odd one out, the reject (mainly due to the social demographic of which online forums pander to; i.e (quasi-)lonely young males of who feel some form of disappointment in mundane reality), and thereby have that need to fit in, to be viewed as mature. And when something is used which relates to the stupid way in which someone used to behave it mortifies them, therefore using outdated lingo from the past which the majority of reddit cringes at disables the opponent as it functions as a fear driving factor not to fit in. Therefore it simply is so powerful as a tool it is still used as arguments and holds karma-worthy potential. \n\ntl;dr: reddit uses terms like \"le\" to mock people because its the equivalent of a embarrassing school photo from the age of 13\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm just rambling\n\n\nedit: my first successful post here!

        "text": "While there are people that try to find a smoking gun behind some activities found on reddit, there are ways in which reddit works wonders and you don't have to look to far for it.  I want to share with you a completely new perspective on how reddit can change perspectives of people from different backgrounds. And one of these things can be found over at our subreddit at /r/iran. \n\nLast year, I joined reddit and made /r/iran my go-to subreddit to check news and strike a conversation about politics and society. My subreddit (I like to call it) is very hot in political issues and a lot of times we have seen people complaining about it but considering the geopolitics of the middle east, it is not often usual for us to ditch politics for even a day. Over there, we have 3 demographics: Iranian inside Iran, outside Iran (expat) and foreigners (we have a few regulars from the U.S. and the UK). Besides posts about Iran, there would be potential tourists asking questions about travelling there or ones that want to review their experience. Moreover, there would be people from different backgrounds or subreddits to ask questions regarding Iranian's/iran's views on a certain topic. Questions ranging from personal to political and so on. We have about 15 regulars each day with ~25-30 online everyday. \n\nLess than a year ago, we had a Brazilian come over for a small discussion and after the thread was over with, he contacted me and had an idea: what if I came over to /r/Brasil and asked Brazilians what they think about Iran. It was a fascinating idea, I thought, but you need a lot of time to reply to those that comment. Maybe they have a question or want opinions. Maybe they want to continue the conversation about something specific. I thought I did not have time so I gave someone else' name and told him to do it. He accepted. The opinion post became active. You can visit it [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/2sl200/question_for_brazilians_what_is_your_opinion_of/). This literally sparked an idea in my [head](https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/2vhirc/i_have_an_idea_lets_go_to_different_country_subs/). As you can see, I thought Opinion posts could end up changing the social image of Iran and bring it to light for those that were exposed to all the media negativity. There was mixed reception. After the success of that thread, I proceeded to contact a list of country subs and asking them if they would like to host such a thing. It was a pilot project therefore, my hopes weren't high, but soon, we had Scotland onboard! We hosted an opinion post and it [went way better]( https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/2y0ehh/opinion_post_about_iran_on_rscotland_is_now/) than I expected. Going through the comments, it was obvious a few people had become interested in visiting Iran. Even a few, I had, through my pilot project, possibly created a potential source of income for Iran ! One that we are currently working towards as a domestic issue to help with the economy a bit. Soon after, another redditor by the name of flaringflame joined and decided to call up on Austria and immediately, they responded, which happened the [next day]( https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/2y4l3f/raustria_opinion_thread_is_active_now/). Again, a mixed feeling from our side, but good reception from the Austrians. Surprisingly, flaringflame was really optimistic and enthusiastic. Read all the comments in the last post. Soon after, I started to schedule invites and coordinate them with flaringflame. In the midst, an angry /r/iranian regular approached me and told me that the project was useless and that asking foreigners for their opinions on Iran would be \"Bad government, good people\" and basically /thread. He was right, so I looked for alternatives. No way, this was going to end so soon for such a small subreddit that needs an alternate image in the world. Not when both Austria and Scotland's posts were too successful. Suddenly, I struck gold one day and told flame about it. Apparently, larger European subs did something called a \"Cultural Exchange\", meaning that  basically, you will create a thread on your sub and our mods will create a thread on our sub. Both of us will sticky the thread and we will exchange various questions and answers regarding our ways of life and about our countries. Even back then, this was a pilot project. Soon, we changed our approach and invited countries for a cultural exchange. At that time, our mod team was limited to 2 active users and an automod that lacked a lot of updates for our sub. We approached one of them and asked if they would allow us to be \"Ambassadors\" relay countries to him to schedule a time appropriate for the sub so he can moderate it. We agreed. Soon, our first exchange occured on the 15th of March with [Sweden]( https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/2z3ob1/greetings_rsweden_today_were_hosting_rsweden_for/) and then Argentina, India and so on. \n\nWe have literally changed a lot of minds about Iran's social views by foreigners. Obviously, only interested people show up whereas the rest either vote and leave or just ignore. Nevertheless, I am happy to say that not only have we created massive opportunities for us to learn about each other but also to understand that reddit can be a beacon of change no matter how big or small. \n\n2 months ago, we exchanged with our political nemesis, Israel and while politics was banned and heavily moderated, it went very pleasantly and even made it to /r/bestof. This is our [entire list of countries]( https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/wiki/exchanges) that we have exchanged with. As a result of all these exchanges, we helped kick off Italy's and Israel's cultural exchanges with other national subreddits. \n\nCurrently, we have scheduled an exchange with /r/USA and /r/Armenia, but due to moderation issues, we have to reschedule it to another day. \n\nI encourage you to look beyond the votes and make a difference, no matter how small. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n-f16falcon\n\nEdit: I realized I have made some grammar mistakes. I did not correct them because I am AFK. \n\nEdit 2: I would like to also point out that the exchanges have been a safe haven from politics for the subscribers of our subreddit. I also remember a user from a foreign subreddit that asked us why we are doing so many exchanges, which indicated to me that it had blown up to a certain proportion (he was a stranger). I think it's now the icon of our small subreddit. \n\nI would also like to ask whether you can suggest to me some other useful subreddits that I can share this information with. Thank you",

I've put the entire comment dataset for the month of July up.  I still need to include submissions, so right now it makes occasional calls to Reddit's API.  This will get fixed once I load the submission dataset. \n\n**The site is here:  http://metrics.pushshift.io**\n\nYou can do a few things with the site.  You can perform a search and restrict it to a subreddit as well.  The month of July is a particularly interesting month for Reddit, because that's when the entire Victoria / Reddit Blackout occurred.  If you do a search with no keyword and type in a subreddit, you can see that subreddit's entire comment volume history for the month.  \n\nDo a search for Victoria first.  The graph will give you an idea of when things exploded on Reddit.  Next, remove Victoria from the search and click on one of the subreddits on the left (like askreddit).  You can see the blackout period for many of the subreddits.  If you zoom in and do a search, it will only search for comments and submissions for that time period.  It's actually extremely flexible -- but I still need to create more indexes to handle searches without a search term. \n\nWhen you do a search with a specific search term or phrase, it will show you on the left (subreddit graph) which subreddits contain that search term/phrase and rank them for you.  Searching for Star Trek (without quotes) is different than searching for \"Star Trek\", as phrases within quotes are matched exactly.\n\nAlso, when you perform a search with a search term, you can click on one of the data points to load comments that were made during that time period.  I need to add more instructions / labels / etc. -- but hopefully if you play around with it, you'll figure out the important stuff.\n\nIf there is interest in this, I'll add more months to the site and connect it to my live data feed so that it updates constantly.  I'll continue to improve the search and add additional features.  If there is a lot of interest, I'll add the entire 2 billion comment dataset (all of Reddit's history).  \n\nPlease note that I have debugging turned on and caching is not turned on at the moment, so if the site gets hit hard, it will go down.  I would appreciate if you not crosspost this to one of the larger subreddits until I get more feedback from the group.\n\nAgain, thanks and please offer suggestions, criticisms, etc.  I am not a front-end designer (I excel in back-end design), so please excuse the messy CSS, javascript as I hacked this out one out very quickly.

        "text": "Everywhere I go on Reddit lately I've been seeing this same complaint about how slow Reddit has gotten. How Reddit has become \"Yesterday's Frontpage.\" While it is true that Reddit recently changed their voting algorithm, the admins switched it back to the original algorithm not long after. There certainly is a psychological factor to Reddit seeming slower after switching back, but here's the real reason:\n\nFacebook's use of trending topics. At any given time while browsing Facebook I can see what's currently trending. As soon as a story breaks and users across social media start talking about it, everyone else on Facebook hears about it almost immediately. That also means people like radio DJ's, bloggers, and Facebook moms are in tune right away to get the message out. This also goes for places like Twitter as well. \n\nWhereas on Reddit, a story takes hundreds to thousands of people getting together to vote on the content to bring the post to the frontpage. On a good day with a big story, it can take a few minutes. Maybe under a half hour. But for other stories it can take multiple hours to get there. \n\nReddit never should've been a place for stories to break; it's just too slow a process to vet content via the upvote/downvote system. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad thing - not all trending content is worth hearing about. The difference is now the playing field has been leveled by Facebook and other social media sites, and third parties can use that to their advantage. \n\nIf the Reddit admins want to stay competitive in this area, I think they should consider creating a \"trending\" category or subreddit for news content. Maybe this isn't Reddit's battle though. That's up to the admins.  \n\nEither way, I just wanted to bring a different way of thinking to this issue. ",

My appeals have ranged from emotionally-charged criticism of the subreddit to earnest apologies including a resolution to better abide by community standards in the future.  In either case, I have never been unbanned from a subreddit which is especially concerning because some subreddits have awfully strict guidelines that are easy to trip over upon first time interactions from visitors.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind no-warning bans.  A moderately large subreddit can quickly become swamped with rule-breaking posts, especially in subs dedicated to more polarizing topics, and it's simply not feasible nor effective to issue a warning to each and every first-time offender, especially when a majority are trolls.\n\nBut I've noticed that upon appeals, mods have always responded to me in a snarky, unprofessional tone (even in cases where I was nothing but polite in my request) and have incited arguments over the banned content in question.  It would seem to me that if a mod has time to reference Pulp Fiction for a witty putdown, that mod can certainly spare the time to tag my account as a first-time offender and check in on my user activity a couple hours later to make sure I'm not a smooth-talking troll.\n\nAnd to be honest, there's a clear distinction between a troll and user who hasn't thoroughly read the sidebar.  A user who breaks a fairly specific rule, say \"no memes\" (this isn't self-referential by the way) probably at least has a passing interest in the subject.  Banning them without chance of appeal for simply not being involved enough to know the difference between /r/theoryofreddit and /r/danktheoryofreddit seems unnecessarily severe.\n\nBut it's possible I'm off base.  I'm not a moderator (of any significant subreddits).  Is there a good reason ban repeals aren't more common.\n\nEDIT: I've noticed that my comments are all upvoted/downvoted collectively each time I come back to this post.  This has turned out to be more polarizing than I intended.",

Reddit is supposed to be customizable, in that you're meant to be able to select which subreddits appear on your frontpage so that it isn't cluttered with shit you don't want. This is great in theory, but I find that what ends up happening is that the most popular subreddits flood the front page, and certain smaller communities will end up on page two. In certain cases this can't be helped, there's simply not enough content. But if, for example, there are five posts from /r/funny on my frontpage, and only one from /r/worldnews, I would want to change that.\n\nWould there be a way to potentially indicate the \"importance\" of certain subreddits? Like a preference slider that you can slide down for really popular subreddits for when you might want a couple lighthearted posts on your front page, but want the vast majority to be something else.\n\nJust a thought. People often complain about this website having shifted from a news source to a memes source, and I wonder if this might have something to do with it.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this thought. If anyone can direct me to a better community, please do so!\n",

        "text": "/r/DataIsBeautiful was created three years ago as a subreddit for data visualization. Until the subreddit was defaulted, it mostly served its purpose as a place for visualization of data, and in particular \"beautiful data,\" as per the subreddit name.\n\n\nBut now, with a quick glance of the subreddit's front page, you'll notice that there are very few posts of data which could be considered \"beautiful\" by any stretch of the imagination - only about 5 posts in the top 25. They're all visualizations of data, sure, but every chart, graph, and table in existence is a visualization of data. Most of them aren't beautiful, and definitely aren't special.\n\n\nIn lieu of beautiful data, you'll find a number of posts intended to promote a certain agenda. This effect is more pronounced if you browse the top weekly/monthly posts on the subreddit, where almost all of the visualized data is not particularly pretty, but rather intends to promote an agenda. \n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3nbb8n/democratic_polls_sanders_is_closing_in_on_clinton/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3nd8df/the_states_with_the_most_gun_laws_see_the_fewest/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3n82qq/services_provided_by_planned_parenthood_20062013/\n\n\nRegardless of whether you support the specific agenda of any given posts (I know I support many of them), it's easy to concede that the subreddit has moved away from its original purpose - attractive data visualization - and moved towards a platform that can be used to promote political and social agendas with statistics. \n\n\nWhy did this happen? \n\n\n1. Default status - it's almost a meme at this point that when a subreddit gets defaulted, its quality goes downhill. /r/dataisbeautiful isn't safe from this effect, either. Look back through the subreddit's posts, and you'll see a fairly significant drop in quality around the time of its defaulting. \n\n\n2. Lax moderation - Moderating a default is hard, but in this case, the mods of dataisbeautiful conceded to the mob of default posters and let the subreddit slip from its original purpose. Look at the sidebar right now and you'll see a short disclaimer: \n\n&gt;DataIsBeautiful is for visualizations that effectively convey information. Aesthetics are an important part of information visualization, but pretty pictures are not the aim of this subreddit.\n\nThis disclaimer didn't exist until very recently - throughout most of the subreddit's history, its sidebar supported the actual purpose of the subreddit - and the fact that it doesn't say what the subreddit's aim is, but rather what its aim *isn't*, is a cop out.\n\n\n/3. Abuse by users - the lax moderation and shifting narrative of /r/dataisbeautiful created the perfect environment for abuse by users, and they embraced it openly. Judging by the number of obviously agenda-driven posts with no noticeable good/outstanding visualization qualities, we can assume that many users are actively and consciously using the subreddit to promote an agenda, whether maliciously or not.",

It makes the front page with thousands of upvotes then all of sudden disappears. \n\nThe reasons can be numerous: broke the rules of the subreddit, ticked off a mod, a mod did not like the comments in the thread, a mod did not like the author, a mod wanted to resubmit it under her secondary account. Whatever the reasons, a post in now hidden on the subreddit and only those with a direct link can find it again.\n\nIt does not matter the reasons. The effect is a person not selected by Reddit admins counteracted decisions made by thousands of users that are not a part of their subreddit. In addition, they hid content on a person's account since removing a post means one cannot see text posts of what a person submitted (in case of self posts).\n\nI cannot argue that moderators should have strong powers on teh subreddit they moderate. They should be able to hide, annotate or lock posts to control the spirit of their subreddit. However, should those same moderators have such control on the appearance of posts on /r/all? Shouldn't it be that moderators have no say on what appears on /r/all seeing as every post technically is /r/all? \n\nSure, if a mod hides a post that is on /r/all, it no longer appears on their subreddit. Perhaps comments hidden by mods appear as collapsed on r/all. Even further, maybe remove the post from all trace of the subreddit that spawned it as it is orphaned on /r/all by its lonesome aside from the link.\n\nIn addition, should hidden self-posts be invisible from user's submission page.

As this isn't SRD I'm not going to go through the whole saga, but it did get me thinking, how would one place a value on being the top mod of a sub?  If one was willing to moderate in a relatively normal fashion, but with an agenda, it would be a great (albeit immoral) way to push that agenda.  However, since the admins have the final control and are not necessarily predictable, there would be limitations on the value.  \n\nDisclaimer: **this is all theoretical as it would be against Reddit rules to buy or sell these positions**\n\nSo, how might one price subreddit control as an asset?\n\nWhat would be the most valuable subs?",

If this doesn't belong here, I apologise]*\n\nKnowYourMeme defines cancer as \"the perceived or actual misuse of internet memes by someone who is unfamiliar with internet culture.\" However, the way I've heard it used, it refers more broadly to terrible content in general. Buzzfeed? Cancer. 9GAG? Cancer. Reddit itself? Stay away from the big default subs, they're full of cancer.\n\nI know this is a very vague definition, but that's exactly the point of this post – to try and find a more specific definition of \"cancer\", to analyse how and why people use this label.\n\nNow, from that (admittedly very vague) definition, you'd expect massive arguments about what is or isn't cancer to explode across the Internet. Someone dismisses something as \"cancer\", someone else gets furious and types a heated reply about why it definitely isn't cancer, and the thread goes down in flames. Right?\n\nActually I think this is pretty rare. **Theory:** Most people will only use strongly negative words like \"cancer\" when they feel confident that they're among people who agree with them.\n\nThat being said, here are some aspects which I think are likely to earn content the \"cancer\" label from at least a section of the Internet:\n\n* **Trying too hard to play on feelings** (\"like and share if you also love your grandma\", \"my autistic veteran brother drew this\")\n* **Banking on people giving you upvotes/likes just because they get the reference** (\"if you remember this, your childhood was awesome\")\n* **Political or moral preaching thinly disguised as humour, with minimal attempt to be witty or original** (/r/AdviceAnimals is chock full of this, to the point that the whole concept of image macros seems to have been invented for it – and in fact some of the most common templates were, such as Unpopular Opinions Puffin, Scumbag Steve and College Liberal)\n* **Sensationalism/clickbait** (\"You'll Never Believe What Happened Next!\")\n* **Gratuitous displays of Social Engagement^TM and/or Deep Wisdom ©**  (Kony 2012, Zen or pseudo-Zen quotes, that stupid video \"I Forgot My Phone\" from a few years back)\n* **Shit-stirring, witch-hunting, etc.** (/r/shitredditsays, much of Tumblr)\n\nSo, thoughts? Other categories you can think of? Personal experiences with \"cancer\" as a term of abuse? Detailed arguments about why the whole premise of this post is misguided and flawed? I'd love to hear them!",

Kinda like watching a star be born or two cars crash, you know what's happening but are not really sure how it's going to end up. The general idea, what makes a meme a meme, is there, but it's structure has not been formalized yet.\n\nTo get some hints I [took a sample of the uses of \"good\" in the largest posts this month,](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/2e6b9696af661afae916/raw/559f4a474ae29e3f5be8130eb8202391f69d13e8/this%2520gist%2520is%2520good) making sure to trim them up and remove any that didn't actually contain the meme.\n\nYou can get the idea of the general syntax, but there are still inconsistencies at a level not seen in any other text memes:\n\n1. Position of \"actually\" relative to the subject.\n\n2. Use of a comma when actually is placed before the subject\n\n2. Use of \"now\" after the adjective (definitively \"good\" at this point)\n\n4. Use of \"really\" before the adjective.\n\nSo, the data:\n\n\n\nUses of \"Actually\" |  % \n---|---|----\nUnused | 27%\n**Before Subject** | **41%**\nAfter Subject | 31%\n\n\nComma use when \"Actually\" precedes the subject |  % \n---|---|----\n**Unused** | **81%**\nUsed| 19%\n\n\nUse of \"Now\" |  % \n---|---|----\nUnused | 21%\n**Used**| **79%**\n\n\n\nUse of \"Really\" |  % \n---|---|----\n**Unused** | **94%**\nUsed| 6%\n\n----\n\nSo it would seem like the most common varient of the meme is heading towards \"Actually [subject] is good now.\" \n\nBUT!\n\nIn cases where this clause is it's own sentence the use of \"Actually,\" begins to almost even out while the presence of it before the subject grows a lot.\n\nSo, my predictions about the future of this wonderful text meme:\n\n* When the meme is used in its own sentence it will take on the form: \"Actually, [subject] is good now.\" with \"really\" being used occasionally and the comma becoming more and more common as time goes on. \n\n* When this meme is used within a more complex sentience the \"actually\" will be moved to the back making \"... this sub is actually good now.\" or \"... this sub is good actually.\" more popular.\n\n\nSomething I found interesting, \"now\" is never used when \"actually\" is at the very end of the expression.\n\nHope this is TOR material. \n\n\n*****\n\nFor future internet historians: I believe /u/crabby_john started this meme, the first occurrence being [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/3h0osv/dont_you_fuckin_shush_me/cu3q817).",

What surprised me is that looking at the responses, it appears that other subs are doing something similar.\n\nIf you are modding and you come across a problem user, you check their history to see whether they really are \"toxic\" and you decide on your response accordingly. To get a bot to simply implement a policy of \"posts in x, must be banned\" seems strange.\n\nI can't really suggest a solution because in any sub, mods can do their own thing as regards banning policies. Some are loose, some are very strict (/r/AskHistorians) but the reason is the posts/comments they have made in that sub. The only places where this is different is in the metasubs, but even there it becomes an offence only if you post in a thread that is being referenced from the meta.\n\nI can't offer any particular solution but I am interested in suggestions.\n\n**Edit:** *Thanks for all the comments, many have said the mods may be acting stupidly but should not be interfered with. Some have just said it is within the mods rights, start a new sub. Some have said that this behaviour is going too far. Admins do take an interest in bots as they impact performance but it isn't exactly clear apart from stopping auto-bans what can be done.*",

This post includes corrected data analysis, shorter/clearer language, and much clearer graphics.*\n\n----\n\nThis July, moderators of [2,278 subreddits joined a “blackout,”](http://socialmediacollective.org/2015/07/09/what-just-happened-on-reddit-understanding-the-moderator-blackout/) demanding better communication and improved moderator tools. As part of [my wider research on the work and position of moderators](http://socialmediacollective.org/2015/06/16/reddit-research/) in [online communities](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/the-tragedy-of-the-digital-commons/395129/), I have also been asking the question: **who joined the July blackout, and what made some moderators and subs more likely to participate?** \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nAcademic research on the work of moderators would expect that the most important predictor of blackout participation would be the workload, which creates common needs across subs. Aaron Shaw and Benjamin Mako Hill argue, based on evidence from Wikia, that as the work of moderating becomes more complex within a community, moderators grow in their own sense of common identity and common needs as distinct from their community [read Shaw and Hill’s Wikia paper here](https://mako.cc/academic/shaw_hill-laboratories_of_oligarchy-DRAFT.pdf). Postigo argues something similar in terms of moderators’ relationship to a platform: when moderators feel like they’re doing huge amounts of work for a company that’s not treating them well, they can develop common interests and push back [read my summary of Postigo’s AOL paper here](http://acawiki.org/Emerging_Sources_of_Labor_on_the_Internet:_The_Case_of_America_Online_Volunteers).\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n**Testing Redditors’ Explanations of  The Blackout**\n\nAfter posting an initial data analysis to reddit three weeks ago, dozens of moderators generously contacted me with comments and offers to let me interview them. In this post, I test hypotheses straight from redditors’ explanations of what led different subreddits to join the blackout. By putting all of these hypotheses into one model, we can see how important they were across reddit, beyond any single sub.  ([see my previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3icvrw/moderator_solidarity_on_reddit_predicting/)) ([learn more about my research ethics and my promises to redditors](http://socialmediacollective.org/2015/06/16/reddit-research/)\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nTLDR: \n\n* Subs who shared mods with other blackout subs were more likely to join the blackout, but controlling for that:\n* Default subs were more likely to join the blackout\n* NSFW subs were more likely to join the blackout\n* Subs with more moderators were slightly more likely to join the blackout\n* More active subs were more likely to join the blackout\n* More isolated subs were less likely to join the blackout\n* Subs whose mods participate in metareddits were more likely to join the blackout\n* Subs whose mods get and give help in moderator-specific subs were no more or less likely to join the blackout\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\nIn my research I have read over a thousand reddit threads, interviewed over a dozen moderators, archived discussions in hundreds of subreddits, and collected data from the reddit API— starting before the blackout. Special thanks to everyone who has spoken with me and shared data. **Do please offer feedback and comments; I am planning to do one more round of analysis, with the feedback of redditors.**\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n \n\n**Improving the Blackout Dataset With Comment Data**\n\nBased on conversations with redditors, I collected more data:\n\n* Instead of the top 20,000 subreddits by subscribers, I now focus on the top subreddits by number of comments in June 2015, thanks to [a comment dataset](https://np.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) collected by /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix\n* I updated my /u/GoldenSights [amageddon dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/wiki/amageddon) to include 400 additional subs, [after feedback from redditors](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3kxadp/stats_me_anything_factors_predicting_the_july/) on /r/TheoryOfReddit \n* I include “NSFW” subreddits intended for people over 18\n* I account for more bots thanks to redditor feedback \n*  I account for changes in subreddit leadership (with some gaps for subreddits that have experienced substantial leadership changes since July)\nIn this dataset, half of the 10 most active subs joined the blackout, 24% of the 100 most active, 14.2% of the 1,000 most active, and 4.7% of the 20,000 most active subreddits. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nTo illustrate the data, here are two charts of the top 52,754 most active subreddits as they would have stood at the end of June. The font size and node size are related to the log-transformed number of comments from June. Ties between subreddits represent shared moderators. The charts are laid out using the ForceAtlas2 layout on Gephi, which has separated out some of the more prominent subreddit networks, including the ImaginaryNetwork, the “SFW Porn” Network, and several NSFW networks.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n[Flickr: Subreddit Moderator Network, July 2 2015, highlighting NSFW subreddits, with notable \"subreddit networks\" labeled](https://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/21282569170/in/dateposted-public/)\n\n[Flickr: Subreddit Blackout July 2, 2015, highlighting subreddits that blacked out](https://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/21452166391/in/album-72157655416577293/)\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n**Redditors’ Explanations Of Blackout Participation**\n\nWith 2,278 subreddits joining the blackout, redditors have many theories for what experiences and factors led subs to join the blackout. In the following section, I share these theories and then test one big logistic regression model that accounts for all of the theories together.\nIn these tests, I consider 52,745 subreddits that had at least one comment in June 2015. A total of 1,342 of these subreddits joined the blackout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe idea of blacking out had come up before. According to one moderator, blacking out was first discussed by moderators three years ago as a way to protest [Gawker’s choice to publish details unmasking a reddit moderator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brutsch). Although some subs banned Gawker URLs from being posted to their communities, the blackout didn’t take off. While some individual subreddits have blacked out in the intervening years, this was the first time that many subs joined together.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI tested these hypotheses with the set of logistic regression models shown below. The final model (on the right) offers the best fit of all the models, with a [McFadden R2](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/99615) of 0.123, which is pretty good.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n[Flickr: Taxonomy of regression models predicting subreddit participation in the blackout of July 2015](https://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/21409656275/in/album-72157655416577293/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*The network of moderators who moderate blackout subs is the strongest predictor in this model. At a basic level, it makes sense that moderators who participated in the blackout in one subreddit might participate in another. [Making sense of this kind of network relationship is a hard problem in network science](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/SteglichSnijdersPearson2010.pdf), and this model doesn’t include time as a dimension, so we don’t consider which subs went dark before which others. If I had data on the time that subreddits went dark, it might be possible to better research this interesting question, like Bogdan State and Lada Adamic did with their [paper on the Facebook equality meme](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/were-all-those-rainbow-profile-photos-another-facebook-experiment/397088/).*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Default subs were more likely to join the blackout**\n\nIn interviews, some moderators pointed out that “most of the conversation about the blackout first took place in the default mod irc channel.” Moderators of top subs described the blackout as mostly an issue concerning default or top subreddits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis hypothesis supported in the final model. For example, while a non-default subreddit with 4 million monthly comments had a 32.9% chance of joining the blackout (holding all else at their means), a default subreddit of the same size had a 48.6% chance of joining the blackout, on average in the population of subs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Subs with more comment activity were more likely to join the blackout**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nModerators of large, non-default subreddits also had plenty of reasons to join the blackout, either because they also shared the need for better moderating tools, or because they had more common contact and sympathy with other moderators as a group.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven among subreddits that declined to joint the blackout, many moderators described feeling obligated to make a decision one way or an other. This surprised moderators of large subreddits, who saw it as an issue for larger groups. Size was a key issue in the hundreds of smaller groups that discussed the possibility, with many wondering if they had much in common with larger subs, or whether blacking out their smaller sub would make any kind of dent in reddit’s advertising revenue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the final model, *larger subs were more likely to join the blackout*, a logarithmic relationship that is mediated by the number of moderators. When we set everything else to its mean, we can observe how this looks for subs of different sizes. In the 50th percentile, subreddits with 6 comments per month had a 1.6% chance of joining the blackout — a number that adds up with so many small subs. In the 75th percentile, subs with 46 comments a month had a 2.5% chance of joining the blackout. Subs with 1,000 comments a month had a 5.4% chance of joining, while subs with 100,000 comments a month had a 15.8% chance of joining the blackout, on average in the population of subs, holding all else constan.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hypothesis 3: NSFW subs were more likely to join the blackout**\n\nIn interviews, some moderators said that they declined to join the blackout because they saw it as something associated with support for [hate speech subreddits taken down by the company in June](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/39bzdf/why_was_rfatpeoplehate_along_with_several_other/) or other parts of reddit they preferred not to be associated with. Default moderators denied this flatly, describing the lengths they went to dissociate from hate speech communities and sentiment against then-CEO Ellen Pao. Nevertheless, many journalists drew this connection, and moderators were worried that they might become associated with those subs despite their efforts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother possibility is that NSFW subs have to do more work to maintain subs that offer high quality NSFW conversations without crossing lines set by reddit and the law. Perhaps NSFW subs just have more work, so they were more likely to see the need for better tools and support from reddit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn the final model, *NSFW subs were more likely to join the blackout* than non-NSFW subs. For example, while a non-default, non-NSFW subreddit with 22,800 of comments had a 11.4% chance of joining the blackout (holding all else at their means), an NSFW subreddit of the same size had a 15.3% chance of joining the blackout, on average in the population of subs. Among less popular subs, a non-NSFW sub with 1,000 comments per month had a 5.4% chance of joining the blackout, while an NSFW sub of the same size had a 7.5% chance of joining, holding all else constant, on average in the population of subs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hypothesis 4: More isolated subs were less likely to join the blackout**\n\nIn the interviews I conducted, as well as the 90 or so interviews I read on /r/subredditoftheday, moderators often contrasted their communities with “the rest of reddit.” When I asked one moderator of a support-oriented subreddit about the blackout, they mentioned that “a lot of the users didn't really identify with the rest of reddit.” Subscribers voted against the blackout, describing it as “a movement we didn't identify with,” this moderator said.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo test hypotheses about more isolated subs, I parsed all comments in every public subreddit in  June 2015, generating an “in/out” ratio. This ratio consists of the total comments within the sub divided by the total comments made elsewhere by the sub’s commenters. A subreddit whose users stayed in one sub would have a ratio above 1, while a subreddit whose users commented widely would have a ratio below 1. I tested other measures, such as the average of per-user in/out ratios, but the overall in/out ratio seems the best.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the final model, *more isolated subs were less likely to join the blackout*, on a logarithmic scale. Most subreddit’s commenters participate actively elsewhere on reddit, at a mean in/out ratio of 0.24. That means that on average, a subreddit's participants make 4 times more comments outside a sub than within it. At this level, holding everything else at their means, a subreddit with 1,000 comments a month had a 4.0% chance of joining the blackout. A similarly-sized subreddit whose users made half of their comments within the sub (in/out ratio of 1.0) had just a 1% chance of joining the blackout. Very isolated subs whose users commented twice as much in-sub had a 0.3% chance of joining the blackout, on average in the population of subs, holding all else constant.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hypothesis 5: Subs with more moderators were more likely to join the blackout**\n\nThis one was my hypothesis, based on a variety of interview details. Subs with more moderators tend to have more complex arrangements for moderating and tend to encounter limitations in mod tools. Sums with more mods also have more people around, so their chances of spotting the blackout in time to participate was also probably higher. On the other hand, subs with more activity tend to have more moderators, so it’s important to control for the relationship between mod count and sub activity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the final model, *subs with more moderators were more likely to join the blackout*. There is a very small relationship here, and the relationship is mediated by the number of comments. For a sub with 1000 comments per month, with everything else at its average, a subreddit with 3 moderators (the average) had 5.4% chance of joining the blackout. A subreddit with 8 moderators had a 6% chance of joining the blackout, on average in the population of subs.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hypothesis 6: Subs with admins as mods were more (or less) likely to join the blackout**\n\nI heard several theories about admins. During the blackout, some redditors claimed that admins were preventing subs from going private. In interviews, moderators tended to voice the opposite opinion. They argued  that subs with admin contact were joining the blackout in order to send a message to the company, urging it to pay more attention to employees who advocated for moderator interests. Moderators at smaller subs said, “we felt 100% independent from admin assistance so it really wasn't our fight.” \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nNone of my hypothesis tests showed any statistically significant relationship between current or past admin roles as moderators and participation in the blackout, either way.  For that reason, I omit it from my final model.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Hypothesis 7: Subs with moderators who moderated other subs were more likely to join the blackout**\n\nI've been wondering if moderators with multiple mod roles elsewhere on reddit would be more likely to join the blackout, perhaps because they had greater \"solidarity\" with other subreddits, or because they were more likely to find out about the blackout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the final model, the reverse is supported. Subs that shared moderators with other subs were actually *less likely to join the blackout*, a relationship that is mediated by the by the number of moderators who also modded blackout subs. Holding blackout sub participation constant, a sub of 1,000 comments per month and 3 moderator roles shared with other subs had a 5.7% chance of joining the blackout, while a more connected sub with 6 shared moderator roles (in the 4th quantile) had a 4.2% chance of joining the blackout, on average in the population of subs, holding all else constant.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Hypothesis 8: Subreddits with mods who also moderate other blackout subs were more likely to join the blackout.**\n\nThis hypothesis is also a carry-over from my previous analysis, where I found a statistically-significant relationship. Note that [making sense of this kind of network relationship is a hard problem](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/SteglichSnijdersPearson2010.pdf) in network science, and that we can’t use this to test “influence.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn the final model, *subreddits with mods with roles in other blackout subs were more likely to join the blackout*, a relationship on a log scale that is mediated by the number of moderator roles shared with other subs more generally. 19% of subs in the sample share at least one moderator with a blackout sub, after removing moderator bots. A sub with 1,000 comments per month that didn’t have any overlapping moderators with blackout subs had a 3.2% chance of joining the blackout, while a sub with one overlapping moderator had an 11.1% chance to join, and a sub with 2 overlapping moderators had a 21.1% chance to join. For a sub with 6 overlapping moderators with blackout subs, a sub had a 57.2% chance of joining the blackout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI tend to see the network of co-moderation as a control variable. We can expect that moderators who joined the blackout would be likely to support it across the many subs they moderate. By accounting for this in the model, we get a clearer picture on the other factors that were important.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Hypothesis 9: Subs with moderators who participate in metareddits were more likely to join the blackout**\n\nIn interviews, several moderators described learning about the blackout from “meta-reddits” which cover major events on the site, and which mostly stayed up during the blackout. Just like we might expect more isolated subs to stay out of the blackout, we might expect moderators who get involved in reddit-wide meta-discussion to join the blackout. I took my list of metareddits from [this TheoryOfReddit wiki post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/meta_subreddits).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn the final model, *subs with moderators who participate in metareddits were more likely to join the blackout*, on a logarithmic scale. Most moderators on the site do not participate in metareddits. A sub of 1,000 comments per month with no metareddit participation by its moderators had a 5.3% chance of joining the blackout, while a similar sub whose moderators made 5 comments on any metareddit per month had a 6.3% chance of joining the blackout.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n**Hypothesis 10: Subs with mods participating in moderator-focused subs were more likely to join the blackout**\n\nAlthough key moderator subs like /r/defaultmods and /r/modtalk are private and inaccessible to me, I could still test a “solidarity” theory. Perhaps moderators who participate in mod-specific subs, who have helped and been helped by other mods, would be more likely to join the blackout? I included /r/modclub, /r/modhelp/, /r/needamod/, /r/ModerationTheory/,/r/csshelp/,/r/modnews/, /r/AskModerators/,  /r/MusicMods/, /r/ModSupport, /r/ModsOfTheRealms/, /r/CollegeMods/, /r/modtools/, /r/redditrequest/, /r/ReadersMilestone/, /r/modgifs\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlthough this predictor is significant in a single-covariate model, when you account for all of the other factors, *mod participation in moderator-focused subs is not a significant predictor of participation in the blackout*. This surprises me. I wonder: since moderator-specific subs tend to have low volume, one month of comments may just not be enough to get a good sense of which moderators participate in those subs. Also, this dataset doesn’t include IRC discussions (nor will it ever), where moderators seem mostly to hang out with and help each other. But from the evidence I have, it looks like help from moderator-focused subs played no part to sway moderators to join the blackout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**So, how DID solidarity develop in the blackout?**\n\nThe question is still open, but from these statistical models, it seems clear that factors beyond moderator workload had a big role to play, even when controlling for mods of multiple subs that joined the blackout. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nIn further analysis in the next week, I’m hoping to include:\n\n*  Activity by mods in each sub (comments, deletions)\n* Comment karma, as another measure of activity (still making sense of the numbers to see if they are useful here)\n* The complexity of the subreddit, as measured by things in the sidebar (possibly)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What are your theories? Add them below, and I’ll see if I can test them in the next week, time and data permitting.**",

In this post, I share an update. I'll also check in on the post periodically to answer questions and incorporate your comments and feedback into new analysis. \n\n-----------\n\nThis July, moderators of [2,278 subreddits joined a “blackout,”](http://socialmediacollective.org/2015/07/09/what-just-happened-on-reddit-understanding-the-moderator-blackout/) demanding better communication and improved moderator tools. As part of [my wider research on the work and position of moderators](http://socialmediacollective.org/2015/06/16/reddit-research/) in [online communities](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/the-tragedy-of-the-digital-commons/395129/), I have also been asking the question: **who joined the July blackout, and what made some subs more likely to participate?** \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nAcademic research on the work of moderators expects the most important predictor of blackout participation to be the workload. Aaron Shaw and Mako Hill argue, based on evidence from Wikia, that as the work of moderating becomes more complex, moderators grow in their own sense of common identity and common needs, becoming more oligarchic. ([read Shaw and Hill’s Wikia paper here](https://mako.cc/academic/shaw_hill-laboratories_of_oligarchy-DRAFT.pdf)). Postigo argues something similar in terms of moderators’ relationship to a platform: when moderators feel like they’re doing huge amounts of work for a company that’s not treating them well, they can develop common interests and push back ([read my summary of Postigo’s AOL paper here](http://acawiki.org/Emerging_Sources_of_Labor_on_the_Internet:_The_Case_of_America_Online_Volunteers)).\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nBy talking to moderators, reading threads, and doing data analysis, I’ve been curious about other important factors beyond the workload or the relationship to the company— factors involving the relationships *across* a site, not just the ones between the company and moderators, or moderators and their community. For example, were more isolated subs whose subscribers never comment elsewhere in reddit more or less likely to join the blackout? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis summer,  I have read over a thousand reddit threads, interviewed over a dozen moderators, archived discussions in hundreds of subreddits, and collected data from the reddit API— starting before the blackout. In this post, I come back with results from the suggestions and ideas that redditors have already offered.

I have removed my findings from the post, am recalculating everything now, and will update this again once I have made the proper adjustments later today.",

Unlike gold,  my idea is that silver would be an internal currency worth nothing but could be gifted in the same way as reddit gold is.  \n\nThere would need to be some way to inject currency into the reddit ecosystem.   Maybe gifted gold gets you x number of reddit silvers.   Maybe monthly allowance or original posts.  Maybe even allow purchase. \n\nWhat could be the impact?  Would adding a new currency like this that was transacted internally provide any benefits?   ",

I already made a post about breaking in new users, but fear it's too little too late.\n\nI'm also active on the Shroomery (since 2003). I was very active in the beginning, but then I started to dislike it more and more, just like Reddit. I do occasionally return and at some point discovered they implemented a Veterans Lounge where only people who have been there 6+ years are allowed. After recently returning to the Shroomery almost everything felt alien, but the Veterans Lounge is great.\n\nThere are too many Reddit veterans for a single subreddit to work, but maybe they could be divided in themes. A problem is getting enough people to notice their existence and join so these subreddits can get started. I know there are bots that will automatically invite users based on karma numbers, so maybe someone could implement that for these too. So all 6y+ (or some other cutoff to be decided) will get a message and invitation to the main veteran sub and from there can join relevant subreddits.\n\nIf it becomes really popular and Reddit would be open to code change, you could even think about having parallel comment threads for all submissions. One only for veterans, and one for all.\n\nFrom my experience with the Shroomery, this really does bring a nice and respectful community back together.",

And while Apple's target demographic might be seen similar to that of the typical redditor - the typical redditor stays away from Apple.\n\nPart of this is that the gaming community is a large part of reddit and Apple products don't hit that demographic.\n\nBut what other factors contribute to this fact? Is my 'fact' biased by an accessibility bias? \n\nInterested in your thoughts!\n",
