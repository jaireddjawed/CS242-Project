Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.\n\nSome questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.\n\nHere are the ground rules:\n\n* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.\n* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.\n* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.\n* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.\n* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.\n* Academic secondary sources are preferred. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).\n* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678294859.0,"comments":[{"author":"WideConsequence2144","text":"Was sliced bread really as impactful as the saying makes it seem?","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678325977.0},{"author":"AlvinLHistory","text":"What is the origin of the title \u201ccolonel\u201d?","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678300015.0},{"author":"SouthernViolinist0","text":"I recently saw the Reagan 80s descibed as a regime of \"military keynesianism\" that stabilised the economy post 1973.

However, a lot of these get born out of \"wisdom after the fact\", as you know, it seems logical that this happened at this time, and it all feels connected, WOW IT\"S A CONSPIRACY. For example, what reminded me of this and triggered to ask this question is a MH17 conspiracy that links it with MH370 disappearance (I know that it doesn't fit the 20 years rule, just using it as an example). A quick refresh, there were two catastrophes of Malaysian Airlines in 2014, first, a Boeing disappeared over the ocean (MH370), then another Boeing was shot over the Donbass (MH17). The conspiracy (one of those surrounding the flights) was that bodies and remains of MH370 were used to \"stage\" MH17, to the point of \"frozen bodies should've been loaded onto the plane rigged to explode\". You can see how this theory could've appeared - without access to the bodies, a regular news reader can think \"it's a suspicous coincidence that these two caatstrophes coincide, it doesn't happen without a reason\" and then it's \"obvious\" for any fan of thrillers and abrupt twists.\n\nSo, that's why I have a question: were there similar theories about events in the past that seemed a mere coincidence, then started out as a conspiracy, and then actually new research or facts supported the \"conspiracy\", and it was not a conspiracy anymore? Could the Trojan dig site be considered an example (I read recently here that it was not the sensation we are led to belive from the current school education)? Maybe Lusitania crash (I see on Wikipedia that there's no conclusion on the origin of the second blast, so maybe it's still an open conspiracy)?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678468201.0},{"author":"just_the_mann","text":"Probably a year or more ago, I stumbled upon a question along the lines of \u201cBefore Columbus sailed to America, what was considered the \u2018greatest discovery\u2019 in the world?

I love this sub. History is my jam","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1678567163.0},{"author":"GloomyGal13","text":"I love history. When i found this sub I was so excited, and joined right away.\n\nI haven't asked a lot of questions (maybe 1? or 2?) and I don't recall getting an answer on one of them, but maybe it wasn't up anyone's historical alley. It was kind of obscure; 'What does 'blacking' the pots mean?\" In reference for the cooks of the English manor to 'tidy up' before an equally noble entourage was to visit. I now think they were referring to seasoning the cast iron cookware. Not certain, but it's a thought!\n\nThat's what I love about history - all the little details. The day to day living. I love a good puzzle, and will spend hours thinking about things, like how or why things were done\/made\/accomplished. \n\nI love reading a good non-fiction history book. Some of my favourites are, in no particular order:\n\n1. This Thing Of Darkness - Harry Thompson. DUAL biography\/adventure of the Captain of the Beagle, Robert Fitzroy, and Charles Darwin, 'ship's naturalist' and gentleman companion to the captain. In those days it was unseemly for the captain to 'hang out' with the crew. He needed someone on the ship at his 'level' simply for companionship. Charles Darwin fit the bill. The story is AMAZINGLY detailed, and after my first read through I went online and FOUND Charles Darwin's journals from his journey on the Beagle, and read his words myself. Harry Thompson did a WONDERFUL job of making this story so intriguing that I had to do my own research. For fun. \n2. . Skeletons on the Zahara: - Dean King. What happens when it's 1800's, you and your buddies are going to become pirates and then get shipwrecked off the north eastern coast of Africa? Find out in this very riveting read. \n3. Champlain's Dream - David Hackett Fischer. WOW! This one blew my mind a couple of times. First was when the author describes where Champlain grew up. Now, I'd lived 10 years in Quebec, and I'd learned some quebequois, which is the French language which has stayed basically true to the words used when the French first came over to the 'new world'. Specifically, the phrase, 'Ferme te gall\/gull. Not sure how to spell it, but it's basically 'shut up' from 1500-1600 France. They still say it in Quebec today, though not in France. His descriptions of interacting with the original inhabitants of the land (my ancestors) was especially appreciated, as our birchbark scrolls were all burned by Jesuit priests. So, I have to learn some of my history through a stranger's looking glass. At least this looking glass wasn't too cloudy. \n\nIn other words, if there's a boat, a voyage, and it's pre 1900, I\"M IN! I love those stories! \n\nOkay, well, I Love this SUB! Miigwich to all the people that make it a dynamic place to learn and share information. :)","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1678571323.0},{"author":"zygotene","text":"As a introverted mum of a little toddler, I was literally thinking about this sub yesterday and how grateful I am for its existence and the way it's run.

Didn't care for it. Everything I learned in history class felt like stuff I had already learned in previous years, or absorbed by osmosis through daily life. I associated history with boredom, repetition, and a constant re-hashing of facts that had already been established. \n\nAskhistorians shattered that view. Here I learned new things every day. I read about things I had never even thought of to question. And I was shown that interpreting the same set of facts from different view points is just as important, if not more so than establishing them. For the first time, history was intellectually simulating for me, and I loved it. I loved it so much I started asking my own questions here. The answers I got were in-depth, approachable, and filled with passion. \n\nNow a days I read history independently for fun, I play video games about history, I run D&D sessions based on history. I almost chose to go back to school for a history degree. and I am genuinely saddened by posts like [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/96yf9h\/monday_methods_why_you_should_not_get_a_history\/) about the worsening state of the field.

World War II had demonstrated the importance of knowing the geography of parts of the earth far from our normal national interests, and the US and its allies invested in worldwide mapping during the Cold War decades.  (So, we later learned, did the Soviets.) By the late 1960s, we were even able to use airborne radar imaging to map cloud-shrouded tropical areas.\n\nEarly spaceflights demonstrated the value of imagery acquired from space, but it took a few years to clear bureaucratic obstacles and create the Landsat program, which finally launched the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (now often called Landsat 1) in 1972. Once satellite imaging became possible, the new imagery did finally allow us to accurately map the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where even airplane overflights were dangerous, weather-dependent, and of limited utility.

I had things to get done tonight! But I also *did* promise I would try to answer this last time you asked it and then never got around to that... So..\n\n--------\n\nIn the immortal words that introduce many a mediocre high school essay, the USSR was a land of contradictions. Its a very trite phrase, but it also was quite true, and I think there are few places where it is more true then in discussing women, and women's rights, during the Stalinist era. In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, it really can be said that the Bolsheviks advanced the rights of women by leaps and bounds compared to the Czarist era, and during the 1920s new opportunities for involvement in public life, and recognition of women on an equal footing with men, presented themselves in many ways. But at the same time, these opportunities were often quite limited, in the first by social and cultural norms that still refused to entirely break, and in the second by the limitations of the *reach* of such reform, which often remained limited to urban centers, and to those with at least some education. A young Muscovite woman in 1925 might think the world her oyster, but her peasant counterpart in a small village ten days walk from Novosibirsk probably saw no real change to her way prospects in life in that period. And then finally, much of the opportunities seemed to roll back in the 1930s as the Soviet leadership sought to reemphasize traditional ideas of domesticity, but it was never a complete reversal (and the war years of course had their own massive impact). I've written much more about this all [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/yr9t2t\/in_ww2_around_20_million_soviet_men_died_leaving\/ivt2i4y\/) so won't harp on it more than I have now to set the scene of multiple competing threads of opportunity and tradition.\n\nWhat this all meant then was that there were many women who were able to take advantage of the legal equality they enjoyed within the Soviet Union, and one popular avenue for this was through two organizations, the first being the Society for the Promotion of Defense and the Furthering of Aviation and of the Chemical Industry of the U.S.S.R., better known by its acronym of OSOAVIAKHIM, and the Komsomol, which was the youth wing of the Communist Party. The former was nominally about training civilians to exist as a massive paramilitary reserve, with some set of skills that could be used in the event of war, while the latter was nominally about encouraging healthy activities by the youth, but *both* converged and overlapped quite a lot I've written a little about this before [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/o7sgeo\/how_common_was_hobbyist_skydiving_in_the_ussr\/h312pep\/) with a focus on *parachute* clubs, which might be of interest but in any case as noted there, air sports in general were quite popular, and aside from parachuting, thousands upon thousands of young Soviet citizens were introduced to flight as well in glider schools.\n\nFrom there, those who 'caught the bug' would continue on to OSOAVIAKHIM run air clubs to learn piloting of powered aircraft. Here is where some of those contradictions come into play though. Nominally, anyone could do so, but there nevertheless remained strong cultural pressure against women joining, and there were often attempts to turn them away without *explicitly* denying them entry, which would have been illegal. This meant that it could often take quite a lot of determination to finally gain entry into these clubs and begin pilot training, and as a result while there were women who persevered, they would be a minority. Mariya Smirnov for instance recalls that in her class of 100 cadets in 1937, she was the lone woman. Of course, it ought to be said that those who made it were ones who were *truly* driven to get through the hurdles placed before them, but that didn't make make it any more of an enjoyable experience. Pennington quotes from a future \"Night Witch\" pilot, Maria Chechneva, describing her pre-war training, which I'll repeat here as illustration:\n\n>Quite a few women were studying at the air club; however, the atti\u00adtude of many of the instructors towards them was, to put it mildly, less than enthusiastic. The instructors took women in their groups unwillingly. That was clear. Women were only beginning to enter avi\u00adation. Not everyone believed that we would be able to work in this field on an equal basis with men. The example of famous women pi\u00adlots did not convince the skeptics. \"Aviation is not a woman's affair,\" they declared repeatedly, and tried in every way possible to dissuade young women from joining the air club.\n\nFor those who did make it in, and managed to get through despite the cold reception, many would simply now be 'pilots', but at least some had military aspirations, which again had no *legal* barriers, but only doubled the cultural opposition. The most famous woman to make it through would be Marina Raskova, who joined the VVS in 1933 as a navigator, and a year later, while only 22, would become the first female military instructor in the USSR. She would go on to gain pilot status, and gain some minor celebrity status through the decade for participation in several flight records. She of course would then play a critical role in the war in using her connections and status to push for the formation of the all-women air units. But that was the future of course. In the 1930s, those few women who made it all the way into military flyer status were simply assigned to units as would be the case for any other flyer (and of course, this remained the case during the war, with not all female pilots and aircrew being in the all-women units. Some simply served alongside the men). \n\nNow, as a more general peeling back, it ought to also be noted just where aviation fit into the Soviet milieu at the time. The USSR had what might be termed an *obsession* with technological progress, and aviation was at the forefront of that, so achievements in the sky were a signature part of Soviet propaganda. Most of those figures were men, but women too were gracing the posters and newsreels. The most famous was the *Rodina*, a 1938 trans-Russian flight by an all-female crew, including Raskova, alongside Polina Osipenko, and Valentina Grizodu\u00adbova. Despite some mishaps at the tail end of the 26 hour flight from Moscow to Komsomolsk (by which I mean poor weather forced them to crash land when they couldn't find the airfield, and they were lost for ten days), they were nevertheless hailed as heroes for setting a new women's straight line distance record and non-stop broken line distance record. The Soviet propaganda machine would easily move over the bad bits, and they were greeted back in Moscow with a parade, and Stalin praising them that *\"these women have avenged the heavy centuries of the oppression of women.\"*\n\nI think that praise again leans into the contradictions we started with, with the few women here being provided opportunities never before available to women, and their actions specifically framed as a fight against gendered oppression, but they were also a privileged few, and that speech coming at the same time that the Stalinist regime was rolling back many of the advancements previously made for women's liberation. The regime could praise with one hand while pushing down with the other quite easily. \n\nStill though, the women were essentially household names in the USSR, and the inspiration they provided women can't be erased either. No doubt they were at least partly responsible for the hundreds upon hundreds of women who sought, and achieved, pilot training in the 1930s. When the way came, while only a small, select cadre were in uniform, many more stood ready, living up to that ideal of the OSOAVIAKHIM. It might have been an uphill battle for them, to make real the *promise* of accessibility, a promise that fell short for probably countless more who didn't push through the cultural barriers in place, but some at least were able to live that Soviet ideal of equality through aviation, and put it in service to the country, although at least in the initial phase of the war they were to be used as trainers in order to free up more *male* pilots for frontline service. That would change soon enough though.\n\nAs a coda for your second question, as far as I know, there was no comparative push for the training of women in *ground crew* roles prior to the war. The female ground crews were recruited and trained specifically for the all-women units formed during the war. While the *pilots* and *aircrew* were recruited from those who had existing training through the OSOAVIAKHIM and Komsomol, as I understand it, the ground crews were recruited from factories and other places where women with more general mechanical and technical training were, on the assumption that they would be easier to then retrain for maintaining aircraft. Many, as I understand, weren't even told what they were volunteering for, just that their skills would be of use for the war and it would get them closer to the front.\n\n**Sources**\n\nAnne Noggle. *A Dance with Death: Soviet Airwomen in World War II.*  2015.\n\nAnna Timofeeva-Egorova. *Over Fields of Fire: Flying the Sturmovik in Action on the Eastern Front 1942-45.* Helion, 2013.\n\nReina Pennington. *Wings, Women, and War: Soviet Airwomen in World War II Combat.* University Press of Kansas, 2001.","upvotes":9,"created_utc":1678582625.0}]},{"title":"20th century South Asian historians, what are some major collections, archives, and general resources (incl. online ones like Hathitrust) you consider essential to your research, and how were you able to access them?

Sassanid art has many influences from Scythian\/Saka art AKA \"animal style\" art. A variety of \"curled up\" poses are common in Scythian animal art - cats and deer are very common, but other animals are shown in curled poses.\n\nThe Scythians\/Saka were neighbours of the Persians for a long time, and while the heyday of the animal style art was the 1st millennium BC, it persisted into the 1st millennium AD, and even the 2nd millennium AD. It influenced the neighbours of the Scythians, not only to the west and south (i.e., the Persians), but also to the north (various Siberian peoples) and east (Turkic and Mongolic peoples, Japan) and south-east (China).\n\nThe influences don't stop at art - there are also strong influence on Persia of Scythian dress, Scythian military practice and military equipment, and perhaps even religion. There is a strong Scythian religious influence on Turko-Mongol peoples, with their traditionally universal sky god (e.g., Tengri) very probably coming from Scythian religion, and also the idea that kingship was granted by Heaven, and (often) that the royal family was of divine descent. Many of these ideas on religion and kingship are also seen in neighbours such as Sasanid Persia and Japan. The Chinese concept of the Mandate of Heaven may well derive from this, and similar the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda might be substantially of Scythian origin.\n\nBeckwith (2023) covers these connections in about as much detail as possible, and describes the Medes and Achaemenid Persians as either part-Scythian creolised cultures, or perhaps even urbanised Scythians.\n\n* Christopher I. Beckwith, *The Scythian Empire: Central Eurasia and the Birth of the Classical Age from Persia to China*, Princeton University Press, 2013.\n\nThere were western influences on Persian (and Median) art. Persian monumental art largely continues the already-ancient Mesopotamian tradition, and this continues at least as late as the Sasanid period. Given that a large part of the surviving Achaemenid art is monumental art, the Near Eastern influence is more obvious at first glance than the Scythian influence, but metal ornaments etc., where that have surviving, often show clear Scythian influences. For example, this group of Achaemenid gold ornaments includes lions in both Near Eastern (middle of bottom) and Scythian (top right) styles:\n\n* https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Achaemenid_gold_ornaments,70.142.6-.11.jpg\n\nFrom the Parthian period onward, we seen more Scythian-influence art. Whether this is because smaller pieces (which are much more likely to be done in this style) have survived, compared to monumental art (which is usually in a Near Eastern style), or whether it was more common at the time is hard to say. Some examples:\n\n* Parthian: https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Parthian_belt_bucket_by_Nickmard_Khoey.jpg\n\n* Parthian: https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Arte_partica,_disco_con_leone_che_attacca_un_cervo,_200-100_ac..JPG\n\n* Parthian: https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Clasp_with_an_eagle_and_its_prey_MET_DT907.jpg\n\nI haven't seen a specifically Scythian simurgh, but if we consider it as a fantastic animal that combines features of birds and beasts, there is plenty of Scythian art in that category, generally in a style similar that seen in depictions of the simurgh. For some examples, see\n\n* Winged elk, https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:18._Flying_elk_with_griffin_burial_mound_Issyk_(V.-IV._B.C.)_Kazakhstan.JPG\n\n* Griffins, https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:%D0%A4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%9F%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8.jpg\n\nThe simurgh isn't the only bird-beast that appears in Persian art; we also see griffons quite often:\n\n* https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Bronze_Plate_Iran_or_Central_Asia_7th_century_CE_(19582688802).jpg\n\nFor even more examples if Scythian bird-beasts, see\n\n* Nomadic art of the eastern Eurasian steppes : the Eugene V. Thaw and other New York collections \/ Emma C. Bunker ; with contributions by James C.Y. Watt, Zhixin Sun: https:\/\/libmma.contentdm.oclc.org\/digital\/collection\/p15324coll10\/id\/96120 \n\nin which we can see:\n\n* pg 55, winged horse\n\n* pg 103, eagles\n\n* pg 107, bird-beasts\n\n* pg 115, winged horses\n\n* pg 159, bird-beast: deer with bird-head-tipped antlers\n\n* pg 173, bird-beast\n\n* pg 24, winged beast\n\n* pg 205, griffon\n\nI haven't seen a simurgh in non-Persian Central Asian art, but the individual artistic elements are there. While the simurgh might be specifically Persian, Persian depictions of the simurgh are generally in Scythian (or, if you prefer, Central Asian) style. Similar non-simurgh bird-beasts such as griffons appear to come from the Scythian region.

Persian designs take many influences from other Near Eastern art, but in Central Asia we can also look to the Bronze Age Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex, also called the Oxus Civilization. Oxus artwork was very similar to the later Scythian Animal Style.

In fact, many indigenous scholars seem to think Hamalainen is a hack, without ever being so blunt about it themselves. Here is one excerpt from a review of \"Indigenous Continent\" in the [Washington Post](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/books\/2022\/10\/05\/indigenous-continent-pekka-hamalainen-review\/):\n\n>In the stories it does tell, \u201cIndigenous Continent\u201d does not fully deliver upon its early promises of Indigenous power and European submission. For example, we learn that the Puritan Great Migration of the 1630s brought thousands of settlers as well as waves of pathogens to New England. Starting in 1633, \u201cmore than eighty percent of the Native Americans in the region died.\u201d As epidemics stalked the lives of Native peoples, the region\u2019s Wabanaki and Pequot communities nonetheless still \u201csurrounded the New Englanders,\u201d exacerbating tensions within Puritan society: \u201cThe Massachusetts project was fraught with ambiguity from the start. The English claimed land for a colony without Indigenous consent.\u201d The subsequent \u201capocalyptic violence\u201d of the Pequot War (1636-1637) featured \u201cgenocidal violence,\u201d as Puritan leaders now believed that Indians remained \u201clesser people who needed to be destroyed to make room for a better world.\u201d None of this suggests any degree of English supplication to Indigenous power. On the contrary, European diseases, demography and desires advanced Puritan settlement.\n\nHamalainen seems really hung up on binary ideas of \"weakness\" and \"strength,\" and one common criticism of his work is that he's more or less just repeating the outdated Euro-centric paradigm while dressing it up as something else. He seems to have a poor grasp of actual native culture and motivations, and doesn't seem particularly interested in differentiating between different groups or tribes beyond his so-called \"empires.\" He mentions that they exist, but spends almost no time discussing them, and in fact spends way more time discussing specific colonial movements.\n\nThis criticism that he's merely repeating the standard paradigm is a common one. Here's another excerpt from a review in the [New Yorker](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2022\/11\/14\/do-we-have-the-history-of-native-americans-backward-indigenous-continent):\n\n>And yet the limitations of H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s approach are striking, too. Despite his avowed aim to tell the story of North America from an Indigenous perspective, the main history he relates largely follows the white settlers in their movements. We get conflict zones in the Appalachians, south of the Great Lakes, in the Ohio River Valley, and, later, on the Great Plains, but in each instance H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen replicates the very thing he has said he was writing against: a fundamentally east-to-west story of European colonial expansion. Nor is the purview of \u201cIndigenous Continent\u201d exactly continental. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen spends hardly any time in the Pacific Northwest or along the California coast. We learn little about the alliances and conflicts between tribal nations and the Spanish which flowed from north to south along the Rio Grande, from what is now Colorado to Mexico City. We learn little, for that matter, about the alliances and conflicts that the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had with the British and the French in what is now Canada, extending all the way north to Hudson Bay. What we get is less an \u201cIndigenous continent\u201d than a Native United States.\n\nJust to really drive this point home, you'll notice that I referred to groups like the Lakota as \"so-called empires\" above. The reason for that is that many native scholars don't accept that it's correct to view native groups through that sort of European lens. From that same New Yorker review:\n\n>The book is, at times, breathless in its exposition, and nuance is sometimes lost in the shuffle. So, too, are the attempts to include Indigenous concepts\u2014linguistic, spiritual, cultural. Scholars will debate whether the formation and expansion of certain tribal nations are best understood in reference to European models of empire. And H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s eagerness to characterize the colonial slaughter of Indigenous people as evidence of fear and weakness wears thin as the tide turns, and the story of pitched battle gives way to one of systematic subjugation.\n\nTo sum it up, most scholars don't appear to take Hamalainen all that seriously. He's done a great job catching headlines and furthering his career, but his actual scholarship seems questionable at best. Again though, this is not my own expert opinion, this is merely what I've been able to gather from looking into his books and the ideas presented in them. If you google reviews of his books, you will find an awful lot of quotes that are basically the polite academic way of saying \"this is crap.\" One good example comes from Ned Blackhawk in a New York Times interview:\n\n>Blackhawk dismissed H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen as a historian of \"equestrianism\" and objected to the book's \"occasional disregard of things like law and policy, which are central to Native American sovereignty and lives.\"\n\nIt's possible other indigenous scholars have a different opinion of his work. Again, I am a non-expert repeating what I found when I looked into this myself, so this is by no means a comprehensive answer as to whether or not Hamalainen is *right*, but that's not what you asked. You asked if his work was \"widely accepted,\" and I think it's fair to say the answer is no.","upvotes":111,"created_utc":1678539716.0}]},{"title":"In today\u2019s age, we see a lot of regulations in combat sports.

Given that there have always been peasant classes, there have always been those for whom the 'cost of living' was difficult. I think our modern reflections on the past tend to focus specifically on the lower middle classes purchasing power. \n\nTo try and give a more academic answer, inflation is not a modern phenomenon. In 1920, the CPI had a 12 month increase of 23.7% in the US. [source](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/mlr\/2014\/article\/one-hundred-years-of-price-change-the-consumer-price-index-and-the-american-inflation-experience.htm%23:~:text%3DThe%252012%252Dmonth%2520increase%2520in,era%2520and%2520the%2520early%25201980s.&ved=2ahUKEwj-mYDs_9P9AhVKRkEAHY56D-oQFnoECAgQBQ&usg=AOvVaw2CsHTp9T46X4PQkbG62X86) This inflation seems to have been driven by rising wages combining with an end to rationing, so is arguably the cost of living rising to meet spending power not exceeding it. But I think its clear some people would have been 'left behind' and felt the pinch from this. [This article ](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/memory.loc.gov\/ammem\/coolhtml\/ccpres07.html%23:~:text%3DProsperity%2520and%2520Thrift%253A%2520Poverty%2520in%2520the%25201920s%26text%3DSome%2520groups%2520did%2520not%2520participate,land%252C%2520rural%2520poverty%2520was%2520widespread.&ved=2ahUKEwj1ldnIgdT9AhUCTEEAHUU6BCEQFnoECAUQBQ&usg=AOvVaw1IzoF_UghAYQZPHGT2QLfm) highlights rural economies as being very hard hit, with 25% of farms being sold due to debt in that decade and farmers seeking better fortune in cities. The farmers faced an overproduction issue which would have meant low food prices for others, but low income to keep up with the rising costs of everything else for food manufacturers. After that 12 month high, the following period of June 1921 saw a fall of 15.8%! A massive readjustment. Then obviously the great depression followed with mass unemployment and price deflation - while the cost of living was falling it was still out of reach for the millions of unemployed. \n\nTo jump to the 1950s as this prompted your question, it seems a weird decade economically. Started with high inflation but maintained low interest rates, which combined with low unemployment should have driven inflation but somewhat inexplicably didn't. [This article ](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/employamerica.medium.com\/expecting-inflation-the-case-of-the-1950s-b197c7a926e6&ved=2ahUKEwi59LW7hNT9AhXOR0EAHW0rBlwQFnoECCEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1PdrziVbFCSkR60kDTnC2b) explores inflation in the 50s compared to the 70s, I freely admit some of it goes over my head! The point it makes about inflation being based on expectations of the future is very relevant to modern day issues - we expect inflation therefore we create it. \n\nI think the main takeaway is that inflation and cost of living crises can have very different causes and so effect different demographics. What makes the current crisis so painful is that inflation is being driven by essentials - food and energy - so directly impacts cost of living. Whereas inflation driven by low unemployment or high wages is reacting to increased spending power, current issues are in many ways wages trying to catch up with increased costs due to covid disruptions and war. \n\nThe annual CPI inflation from 1913 - present can be found [here](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/www.minneapolisfed.org\/about-us\/monetary-policy\/inflation-calculator\/consumer-price-index-1913-&ved=2ahUKEwiL2tDEiNT9AhW0QEEAHQMsDz0QFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1EWOlXnnEY0XA5tdn-YYDk) and there are clear points where the cost of living jumps.\n\nI stumbled across [this article ](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/mlr\/2014\/article\/one-hundred-years-of-price-change-the-consumer-price-index-and-the-american-inflation-experience.htm&ved=2ahUKEwi2uNy6itT9AhV9RkEAHawMBwgQFnoECA0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2CsHTp9T46X4PQkbG62X86), It lists the CPi in the following periods as\n\n1913 - 1929 : Increase 3.5% annually, 72.7% total period. \n1929 - 1941: Decrease 1.3% annually, 14% total period. \n1941 - 1951: Increase 5.8% annually, 76.4% total period. \n1951 - 1968: Increase 1.7% annually, 33.9% total period.\n1968 - 1983: Increase 7.3% annually, 186.4% total period.\n1983 - 2013: Increase 2.9% annually, 133.96% total period.  \n\nIf we compare that with wage growth in the same periods we can get an idea of when cost of living got better or worse, but these are annoyingly hard to find. We also need to bear in mind income inequality. You can find figures showing that average wage growth has roughly matched inflation [6.2% from 1960 to 2023](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/wage-growth%23:~:text%3DWage%2520Growth%2520in%2520the%2520United,percent%2520in%2520March%2520of%25202009.&ved=2ahUKEwiI2YWlldT9AhXJbMAKHSkiCpIQFnoECBQQBQ&usg=AOvVaw3dCIrihQy0M9USMRB4WF5N) but this disregards that most of that growth has been in top earners. \n\nAs [this article ](https:\/\/www.epi.org\/publication\/swa-wages-2019\/#fig-f) observes \n\n\"To put this growth in inequality in perspective, consider that the 10th-percentile wage grew from $9.75 to $10.07. Over this 40-year period, wages for this group increased only $0.32 in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. The median wage grew from $16.79 to $19.33, an increase of $2.54. At the top, the 95th-percentile wage grew from $41.15 to $67.14, an increase of $25.99.\u00a0\"\n\nThese figures indicate that overall wages have slightly exceeded inflation, so arguably the cost of living is lower today than the 1950s. It all gets a bit political, some sources argue wages have met or exceeded inflation some argue they have fallen below. It depends on what narrative they want to push. Wages clearly have not matched productivity. \n\nI'm aware this has got a bit rambly, apologies. The TL:DR would be that yes people have faced similar cost of living crises in the past, there have been periods where inflation outstripped wage growth. In particular it is when inflation of essential goods outstrips wages of the lowest earners that it becomes a serious crisis, or deflation with high unemployment producing the same outcome that lots of people cannot afford necessities. The cost of living today is markedly lower than the 1950s when it comes to things like buying white goods and markedly higher when it comes to buying food or property. \n\nI would question your supposition that cost of living was not an issue pre industrialisation. The improvements in living standards [source ](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https:\/\/www.lcps.org\/cms\/lib4\/VA01000195\/Centricity\/Domain\/10599\/Social%2520Effects%2520of%2520the%2520Industrial%2520Revolution.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiH6O2Bn9T9AhUOQUEAHT1kAX0QFnoECBoQBQ&usg=AOvVaw2NYBCWw3XEH4w6_JqD1UUh) from the industrial revolution were in part due to increased prosperity. So logically prior to this people could not afford the same standard of living, due to lower earnings and higher costs.","upvotes":37,"created_utc":1678550538.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-5,"created_utc":1678551969.0}]},{"title":"To what extent was the rise of fascism in Europe in the 20s and 30s, to some degree, a way for corporations and rich elites to \"shore up\" capitalism?","author":"JohnEGirlsBravo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11oyz3b\/to_what_extent_was_the_rise_of_fascism_in_europe\/","text":"For starters, I'm sure we've all heard the term \"fascism is capitalism in decay.\"  Essentially, from what I can tell, the basic implication from said phrase is that, supposedly, when private capitalists in control of various industries \"felt threatened\" by certain \"very-destabilizing\/unstable economic conditions\" which, perhaps, they were afraid could well have \"led to socialist or leftist revolution that could dethrone us as a ruling class and\/or eliminate capitalism altogether\", they 'banded together' to, essentially, support whoever, politically, they felt would \"bring down\" all of those 'threatening groups' to \"shore up\" their own capitalist power within the economy.  However...\n\nfor one, wasn't Mussolini a former socialist, and, based on some of his rhetoric and policies, didn't he and the Italian Fascists, as leaders of Italy beginning in the 1920s, \\*actually implement and put in place\\* a lot of \\*very-restrictive\\* regulations on 'how to manage and run the economy', esp. on capitalists and corporate elites themselves (though, perhaps, not necessarily ridding them of \\*all\\* their wealth and\/or power\\*?  Also... I remember coming upon an article claiming that, among other things, at least one major historian likened old-school fascism of that time to, \"right-wing socialism\", funny enough.  Not to mention that, despite some \"lefties\" in countries like the US likening, say, corporate lobbies being \"too close\" to various politicians in our democracies as \"fascist\", the actual 'corporatism' Mussolini described was a much-more harmonious and controlled arrangement, per industry or 'societal grouping', formally managed by the gov't, in the end?  Not exactly 'the same' as \"private lobbyists for Citibank trying their damndest to bribe or 'buy' politicians with heavy campaign donations or doing their damndest to 'get more subsidies' while operating largely on their own nonetheless.\" And, finally, even in his Fascist days, I recall, if memory serves, Mussolini and his ilk, during their takeover of Italy, \"calling out\", to some degree, the \"greediest\" and\/or \"most-powerful\" of the private capitalists enabled by previous capitalist practice and 'lax' economic policy?\n\nAs concerns Nazi Germany, in spite of them, perhaps, in the early days of their 1930s campaigns for office- esp. legislative office- being something of an \"intentional sham\" to \"win support\" for a \\*secret, very-odious agenda\\*, didn't the Nazis also take control of much of the Germany economy, compared to the 'more liberal' Weimar Republic?  Or, at least, were, if nothing else, heavily-interventionist within said economy?  I also recall hearing about a 'leftist' German economist who left Germany when things got too risky, who published a book called \"The Vampire State.\"  Supposedly he analyzed 'Nazi control' of the German economy \\*and\\*, to some degree, \"received complaints\" from even big-businessmen within Germany that, \"The Nazis are choking us\", so to speak?  This would seem to be, to some degree, to be \"a tad contrary\" to the idea that capitalists, in the early days, 'supported fascism to shore-up their own corporate power'?\n\nThen again, it's also true, if memory serves, that the modern term \"privatization\" \\*actually came from German practices\\* of that like, I believe?  Furthermore, insofar as they \"abandoned\" whatever \"socialist promises\" they 'made to the people' in the early years of their runs for power, did the bulk of Nazis (National Socialists) really \"have almost no intentions or ideals of doing anything remotely-close to socialism, let alone an expanded welfare state\", or is it simply the case that, thanks to high-level leaders like Hitler and \\*their\\* racialist-genocidal agendas, the party was 'steered in the wrong direction', so to speak, in a big way?  W\/ those who were \"socialist or center-left\" being \"undermined\" in a lot of ways?\n\nAnd... to what extent did 'the capitalist class' \"actually fund and\/or support\", in a MAJOR WAY, the early Nazis and Italian Fascists??  \\*Is\\* there hard evidence that early Nazi originators like Hitler \"got the bulk of support and\/or funding\" \\*from\\* the capitalist class, or was more of their funding from semi-wealthy and\/or middle-class folks who were, to some degree, more \"ultraconservative\" in values outside of purely-economic concerns?  Maybe this seems a bit \"naive\", but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the notion that, \"Most of Hitler's and\/or Mussolini's early supporters who helped them get into power in a big way were actual corporate execs and high-level managers worth a lot of money\"?  Is it more of a \\*combination\\* of wealthy support, to some degree, with 'ultraconservative' semi-wealthy and middle-class folks \\*also\\* supporting them, which helped them get to power?  Were most capitalists really as \"diehard traditionalist\" and\/or reactionary, in those days, in both nations, as the implication would seem, or were they, in fact, only a tiny minority of actual supporters (the most-reactionary and\/or traditionalist among said capitalists, that is)?\n\nOverall, what was \"the essence\" of fascism, economically?  Can we say, with confidence, that it was simply, \"capitalism in decay\", per se, or is it a bit more complex?  Were policies of Italian Fascism and Nazi Germany simply \"so chaotic\", in terms of constantly changing, that there was a 'broad mix' of increased laxity \\*and\\* increased intervention, throughout various parts of said economies?  Did the capitalist class of both societies 'support' both parties simply to \"shore up\" their power, at large, or did only a fraction of each nation's capitalist support them (the most reactionary and authoritarian)?  If it's the latter, why are such \"rumors\" of \"mass capitalist support\" for fascism still spread so much (esp. within socialist and leftist circles online)?  And, finally... why would capitalists who weren't 'otherwise-very-reactionary' support such a \\*radical shift\\* in government and politics \\*as fascism\\*, just to \"shore up capitalism\" when... in countries like the US, for example, well into the 1800s and early 1900s, \"corporatist\" governments throughout the country were PERFECTLY WILLING AND ABLE to \"help the capitalists keep 'unfettered' capitalism intact\" for a long while (until 30s with Wagner Act)?  Why would Germany and\/or Italy, in those days, feel like they \"need\" fascism, per se, to \"take down\" the communists, unions and the like?  Was the 'threat of full-scale revolution' really so much bigger in those days?  Wouldn't a heavily anti-union, anti-worker \"laissez-faire-esque\" Germany and\/or Italy, politics-wise have \"done the job\" just fine, in terms of repressing worker and anti-corporate revolt?\n\nWas fascism, economically, simply a \"managed capitalism\" that various corporate leaders (and small businessmen, to some extent) in both nations felt was \"necessary for a while\" to \"keep threats at bay\" to their economic power (let alone capitalism as a whole), which they were willing to \"put up with a lot\" so long as workers got few-to-zero rights and such?  But... come to think of it, I recently came across info suggesting that, in fact, to some degree, in at least \\*some\\* German workplaces, there \\*was\\*, if nothing else, enterprise unions which may have \"campaigned fairly hard\" on \\*behalf of\\* workers in certain industries? ...which might seem to 'run contrary' to the notion that those corporate leaders \"accepted fascist control to put up with an interventionist arrangement to keep anti-corporate power and rebellion under control\"?\n\nFurthermore... why did a group of, at best, mostly \\*middle-class or upper-middle-class ultraconservatives\\* form and start the Nazi Party and Fascist Italy, if it was a \"last-ditch effort to shore-up economic power and capitalism\" from the 'corporate ruling class', for a highly-reactionary anticommunist agenda?  If \\*the capitalists themselves\\* truly were, for the most part, \"fascists at heart purely for economic motivations\", why didn't \\*they\\*, themselves, campaign heavily to \"undermine elections in favor of corporate power\", in \"standard elections\" (similar to corporate control in US, Canadian and similar \"bourgeois\" democratic processes of the modern era)?  Could they not have \"formed their own 'populist' party or 2\" in favor of such stuff, esp. with heavy funding of their own? Or maybe, at least, 'lobby hard' the executive and\/or legislative branches of Italy and Germany pre-fascism? rather than rely on some 'random newcomer' like Hitler\n\nMy apologies for the length of this post.  I initially wanted it to be a lot shorter, but... this is basically my \"internal thought process\", as of now, regarding the various \"contradictions\" within the 'public discourse' vs. \"what really went on\" wrt Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in terms of \"actual\" economic policy.  As you can see, the \"potential contradictions\" have been a lot for me to contend with, so I'm curious if any historian who manages to read the whole post (thank you) can come up with a cogent, not-too-complex answer in response?  To help me 'grasp more fully' how fascism, in the 20s, 30s and 40s, \"actually operated.\"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678578132.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Your feline friend's incursion need not ruin the manuscript that you've been working on and working over for these past many months.\n\nThe process for \"erasing\" on vellum is actually straightforward and can be accomplished in one of several ways.  The most straightforward was the use of a pumice stone to physically remove the error.  Vellum\/parchment is not as thin as modern paper, it is treated animal skin afterall and is of considerably greater thickness than paper or papyrus.  Physically eroding the previous writing is therefore possible without the destruction of the page.  Pumice stones were used to physically remove the mistakes from the page.  The bare area of the parchment could then be redone without disrupting the piece of the manuscript as a whole.  This works best for small mistakes, such an errant line here, a spilled blot of ink there, or a miniature that isn't quite coming together in the marginalia.  In the case of a cat's paw staining the bottom of the page, this would likely be all you'd need to do in order to correct the unintended intrusion.  \n\nWhat if you made a mistake on one of the writing lines?  The vellum was usually prepared with very faint lines in the center of the page to help with the placement of letters, and if you, in a hurry to complete your work, made a small mistake of grammar or punctuation, what could be done to remedy it?  A small scraping of the vellum with a fine knife would probably get the job done.  Assuming you even really wanted to make the correction, or even recognized it as a mistake.  The Middle Ages were a time of a lack of standard spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  [Indeed what we now recognize as hallmarks of legible texts, different case letters, punctuation, space between words, and the like were largely medieval innovations to aid in the legibility and ease of transmission of knowledge.](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Codex_Amiatinus_-_Gospel_of_Mark%2C_chapter_1.jpg)  \n\nThese sorts of niceties were not a mainstay of literacy stretching back into the antique past.  [During the heyday of the Classical World inscriptions and writings usually lacked these modern luxuries and sentences were instead marked with verbs or other forms of delineation.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Koine_Greek#\/media\/File:P46.jpg)  However, the state of Latin literacy in the European Middle Ages, while common, was not up to the standards of the titans of Classical Rome and Cicero and Caesar alike would have likely balked at the much more free approach to the \"rules\" of Latin grammar that Medieval writers adhered to.  This is why for you students of Latin out there that certain words have different meanings\/rules depending on if the writing is Medieval, Ecclesiastical, or Classical.  So your mistake, depending on what the mistake was, may not even really matter!\n\nBut what if the sheet *is* ruined?  What do you do if the entire page needs to be reworked?  \n\nDon't worry that is fixable as well!  Parchment and vellum are rather sturdy writing mediums and can take all sorts of abuse that paper or papyrus cannot withstand.  One option that you have if you need to re-do the entire page would be to wash it!  Throw the page in a bucket of water with some soap, or use some form of irritant and simply wash out the ink.  This is how a number of medieval manuscripts began their life.  Older writings from the ancient world were washed in this way to clean them of their current writings and to make functionally new pieces of parchment that could be overwritten.  These are called *palimpsests*, where the old writing was overdone by new writing after the manuscript page was cleaned in this way.  There are a number of ancient writings that only survived this way due to their recycling into medieval manuscripts.  The cleaning process was not absolute and many of these ancient works can still be read using modern technologies to read the writing that the Medieval people tried to erase.  \n\nSo don't fear!  You can still correct your mistake and finish your piece of work, and the client need not be any the wiser!","upvotes":2266,"created_utc":1678457815.0},{"author":"jonwilliamsl","text":"There's definitely a way to salvage this sheet.\n\nVellum, for those who don't know, is a non-tanned animal skin product. It consists of the stretched, cleaned and dried dermis of animals, usually cows, sheep or goats (though many different animal species can and have been used). Parchment and vellum are made in the same way. Vellum denotes a higher-quality (thinner and with fewer blemishes), often made of fetal calfskin.\n\nOnce the skin has been cleaned and soaked in limewater (a saturated aqeuous solution of calcium hydroxide) for days or weeks, the final step is to [stretch the skin on a frame, allow it to dry, and scrape and sand it smooth](https:\/\/gilbertredman.com\/medievalmanuscripts\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2015\/09\/parchmenter.png). Sanding traditionally occurred with pumice, and the skin might also be whitened with chalk at this stage.\n\nThis is much more demanding, both of raw materials (an animal must die) and time (at least 2 weeks per sheet) than paper, but it can be reused. Vellum is very strong; it handles more similarly to a sheet of plastic than a sheet of paper. As such, it's pretty easy to reuse. [From the Vatican Library:](https:\/\/spotlight.vatlib.it\/palimpsests\/feature\/methods-of-removing-the-ancient-texts)\n\n>*Quicunque in semel scripto pergameno necessitate cogente iterato scribere velit, accipiat lac inponatque pergamenum per unius noctis spacium. Quod postquam inde sustulerit, farre aspersum, ne ubi siccare incipit, in rugas contrahatur, sub pressura castiget quoad exsiccetur.

As soon as it is taken out, it should be strewn with flour in order that it not be wrinkled after it begins to dry, and so as to be kept under pressure until it dries out. After it is done, the parchment will regain its former quality, shining and lucid, by means of pumice stone and chalk. \n\nThese hidden texts are often fairly easy to re-discover, and are known as \"palimpsests\" (from the Greek, meaning \"scraped again\").\n\nOur scribe above describes a fairly gentle removal method; later removal methods were more aggressive and left less to be discovered later.\n\nHoles in the skin, either from injuries from the animal's life or from sloppy preparation of the skin (I can attest that it's very easy to gouge a hole while scraping) could be either [written around](http:\/\/web.ceu.hu\/medstud\/manual\/MMM\/BigImages\/pic04.jpg) or [decoratively \"mended\", or even incorporated into the text itself](https:\/\/www.themorgan.org\/blog\/holey-moly-historical-damage-and-repairs-medieval-manuscripts). (If you follow only one link in this answer, let it be this one. These repairs are gorgeous).\n\nAnother option is to simply use the skin for something else.

You could in theory do the same with a cat's paw-print: some manuscripts are palimpsests, which is when the original text of a manuscript was entirely erased and replaced with a new text.\n\nIf the parchment was damaged at a more than surface level, so you couldn't just scrape it off (but not so badly damage that any previous text was now illegible, or so that you couldn't write on it at all), you could write a note complaining about the poor quality of the parchment or the misfortune that caused the damage to occur. There's an example of that [here](https:\/\/medievalfragments.wordpress.com\/2013\/02\/22\/paws-pee-and-mice-cats-among-medieval-manuscripts\/), where a cat pissed on the parchment.\n\nSome pieces of parchment have minor flaws in them due to the process of making it: the parchment has to be stretched, which can lead to small tears and holes. In some cases the holes are [sewn up](https:\/\/theparkerlibrary.wordpress.com\/2018\/08\/03\/holey-books-ancrene-wisse-and-the-art-of-medieval-manuscript-repair\/), in other cases the scribe [decorates](https:\/\/blogs.bl.uk\/digitisedmanuscripts\/2018\/03\/if-youve-got-it-flaw-nt-it.html) the hole (in the first image on the BL manuscripts blog you linked in, there are two holes by the 'F' which a scribe has rimmed with red ink), and sometimes the scribe would just ignore the hole.\n\nParticularly prestigious manuscripts were more likely to use parchment without holes, or only with very small holes, but [making parchment](https:\/\/makingmanuscriptsblog.wordpress.com\/2017\/11\/23\/parchment-making-manuscript-material-from-animal-skin\/) is time-consuming and requires sufficient suitable animals, so you can't always be picky about which sheets of parchment you use. To go back to your original scenario, it would depend on what you were copying, who it was for, and how wealthy the monastery was\/how much parchment they had access to. For a less prestigious copy, you'd clean the parchment and try to remove the paw-print and then continue to use the parchment as it was. If it was a more prestigious piece you were working on, and you really couldn't remove or hide the marks, then you might be able to get some clean parchment (and the marked parchment would be used for a less important work). I suspect that the majority of paw-marks in manuscripts occurred after the work was written, as if it occurred before, it would be fairly simple for a scribe to reach for their knife and scrape off the mark. However, the value of cats to monasteries and libraries outweighed the danger of them jumping on manuscripts, as they helped stop mice eating the whole piece of parchment.","upvotes":31,"created_utc":1678477609.0},{"author":"13eco13","text":"So many great answers on how mistakes on vellum and\/or parchment could be fairly easily be corrected, but then that begs the question...why were so many of them NOT corrected then?

I did not listen to the whole thing, but it seems to be a combination of politized readings, fabrications, half-truths, misleading statements, and hyperbole. What makes this kind of thing ostensibly compelling for many on the Left is that it does speak to a certain truth that has been commented on by a number of historians; that  popular conceptions of Stalin and Stalinism are often distorted and this is in part due to cold-war polemic, anti-communist ideology, and overly zealous Trotskyist interpretations. These currents convey an emotionally charged opposition to Stalinism that has often lead to simplistic and politically convenient characterizations of the period. Lynn Viola, many decades ago, commenting in a negative review of a book that exemplified the problems with this approach:\n\n>The book perpetuates cold-war views of the Soviet Union that counterpose an alien, oppressive state to a repressed, atomized populace. It fails to fulfil the great need of the profession for a balanced, thorough, and readable textbook on Soviet history.\n\nThere is no denying that Stalin was a brutal and ruthless leader who was responsible for the death of millions, but the fixation on Stalin's personality or the extent of his supposedly  \"total\" power has at times overshadowed analysis of the nuances of the Soviet state. This was a transcontinental country that once covered 1\/6th of Earth, encompassing millions of people. The tendency to reduce its entirety to the brutality of a few personalities proved to be a barrier for historians seeking to understand the USSR in all its complexity. In turn, \"cold warriors\" sometimes saw this turn to social and cultural histories of below as implicitly letting Stalinism off the hook, a recurring critique of revisionist scholars carrying out more balanced readings of the era. These cold-war era assessments have now largely fallen out of favor among Soviet specialists working in the archives, but still persist in the popular imagining of Stalinism.\n\nThis podcast is an overcorrection to these cold-war style past depictions of Stalinism, exploiting legitimate debates regarding Stalin-era USSR to traffic a hagiographic view of Stalin. I want to address two aspects of your Title, both the \"totalitarian\" and the \"megalomaniac\" characterization of Stalin. \"Revisionist\" scholars like Fitzpatrick, Lynn Viola, J Archy Getty, and Robert Thurston led the initial efforts against cold-war readings of Stalinism by focusing on the complex interactions between the Soviet state and its citizens. These scholars rejected the reading of the USSR as a \"totalitarian\" state acting in a unidirectional manner upon its populace.\n\nThurston, notoriously, was the sharpest critic of the totalitarianism thesis, and was even accused of apologizing for Stalinism by some. I don't agree with that, but his major work on the period is provocative because it (persuasively) argued that some forms of democracy and popular participation of Soviet people existed within the regime, challenging the characterization of the USSR as a completely authoritarian regime. He also argued that Stalin had some degree of popular legitimacy especially after \"The Great Patriotic War\" and that most people did not live in terror and fear during the Great Terror period. At the same time, he did not dispute that Stalin was a ruthless dictator who carried out brutal violence. This emphasize on the seemingly positive dimensions of Stalinism was a controversial yet worthwhile contribution to the scholarship. The role of \"democracy\" and popular participation of Soviet citizens within the Stalinist state has been further elaborated by scholars like Wendy Goldman and David Priestland more recently.\n\nJ Arch Getty has also persuasively argued that the Terror was not a pre-planned campaign of extermination. In his view, the Great Terror demonstrates that the Stalinist state \\*lacked\\* total power, as it was a response to perceived threats from a place of weakness. Stalin, distrustful and insecure as he was, perceived the state as being penetrated by enemies, and the ensuing waves of violence were ad hoc spasms of repression by a leadership that saw itself under siege--even if that wasn't actually the case. In his work, Getty also emphasizes how the Terror should also partly be understood as a kind of power-struggle between the regional bosses and the central leadership, as the central leadership mobilized local populations against so-called \"wrecker\" or incompetent regional leaders when they failed to reach absurdly high production quotas, disobeyed  central directives, misused state funds, centralized their own regional power--among other transgressions. There were instances when these regional bosses wanted to purge \\*more\\* people than the central leadership was willing to allow, and the latter had to curtail excesses of the former. This ongoing struggle between the periphery and center, Getty argues, ultimately led the central leadership to wipe out all the regional bosses. Thus the reduction of the Terror to Stalin's individual cruelty obscures the political dynamics play stemming from the \"deep structure\" of the Soviet state. None of this absolves of Stalin, who signed off on countless executions  and worked closely with the leaders of the NKVD, but violence still exceeded him.\n\nIts helpful to understand Stalin as a product of a particular social system and political culture inherited from a clandestine revolutionary underground. Stalin as a \"psychopath\" or \"megalomaniac' are unhelpful descriptions because they obscure what actually motivated him. He was not a deranged psychopath that killed people for amusement. Stalin was an intellectual, a deeply committed communist, and a pragmatic stateman. He was also deeply suspicious, distrustful, ideological, and displayed a staggering indifference to human life. He was not simply a power-hungry tyrant who sought to accumulate power for powers sake. He was a genuine communist who saw the protection and extension of his own power as the protection and extension of the socialist system--one that was, in his view, a socially just and emancipatory vision of society as opposed to capitalism, which was exploitative and cruel. Mass violence was seen as justifiable in the pursuit of a communist utopia.\n\nSo to conclude, yes inaccurate cold-war style views of Stalin and Stalinism are still dominant today. Still, Stalin was a ruthless dictator who presided over a brutal regime that killed millions. Both things can be true.\n\nSources\n\nEdele M. (2020). *Debates on stalinism*.

The truth, though, is that Aristophanes probably didn't have much to worry about after Socrates's death in 399 BCE, for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, we know that, in historical reality, the execution of Socrates seems to have had little impact on Aristophanes's livelihood or his career as a comic playwright. In fact, he actually wrote and produced two of his eleven surviving plays *after* the death of Socrates. His *Ekklesiazousai* or *Assemblywomen* was first performed c. 391 BCE and the version of his *Ploutos* or *Wealth* that has survived was first performed in 388 BCE. He wrote and produced at least two more datable non-surviving plays after that: *Kokalos* in 387 BCE and a revised version of *Aiolosikon* in 386 BCE. He probably died sometime that same year at the age of about sixty.\n\nEven if we ignore the fact that Socrates's followers didn't seek revenge against Aristophanes historically, it is highly unlikely that they actually blamed him very much for their teacher's execution in the first place. For one thing, there's the issue of chronology. Aristophanes's play *The Clouds*, which made fun of Socrates, was originally performed at the City Dionysia in 423 BCE, but Socrates wasn't executed until 399 BCE\u2014a full twenty-four years later.\n\nAt the time when the *Clouds* was first performed, the majority of Socrates's students who were still alive at the time of his death were either very young children or not even born yet. At the time, Xenophon was probably about seven years old and Plato was somewhere between a newborn infant at the youngest and a five-year-old at the oldest. Thus, it is extremely unlikely that either of them actually saw the original performance of the play.\n\nFurthermore, Aristophanes was not the only contemporary comic playwright who made fun of Socrates on stage. Surviving fragments of lost plays by the playwrights Eupolis and Ameipsias indicate that they also made fun of Socrates. In other words, Socrates seems to have been a fairly popular figure for comic playwrights to make fun of; Aristophanes just happened to be the one who did so most famously.\n\nAdditionally, Plato actually features Aristophanes as a speaker in his dialogue the *Symposion*, in which he seems to portray him as being quite amiable and on friendly terms with Socrates in real life. It would be hasty to interpret the *Symposion* as evidence that Socrates and Aristophanes were really friends, considering that the conversation the dialogue describes is almost certainly fictional. Nonetheless, the *Symposion* does indicate that Plato at least could imagine them as getting along fine, which suggests that Plato probably did not harbor strong resentment against Aristophanes for having lampooned Socrates in the *Clouds*.\n\nFinally, as far as there is surviving evidence, Aristophanes had no direct involvement of any kind in Socrates's actual prosecution. It is true that Plato in his *Apology of Socrates* 19b\u2013c does portray Socrates as claiming that his prosecutors' portrayal of him is lifted from the *Clouds*, but it is unlikely that Plato actually regarded Aristophanes as having any real responsibility for the charges against his teacher.\n\nInstead, Plato most likely portrays Socrates as linking his prosecutors' portrayal of him to Aristophanes for purely rhetorical reasons. Simply put, the *Clouds* was a comedy; no one with even two grains of common sense believed that its portrayal of Socrates was completely accurate. Even more than that, at the time of Socrates's trial, it was a comedy that had been performed over two decades earlier.\n\nThus, in Plato's *Apology*, claiming that Socrates's prosecutors got their portrayal of him from the *Clouds* rhetorically serves as a way of discrediting them by implying that they can't tell the difference between a decades-old satire and real life. This would be like if Bill Clinton were accused of some crime and brought to court today and he went up in front of the court and said that his prosecutors were just lifting all their ideas from how he was portrayed on *Saturday Night Live* back in the 1990s.","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1678563981.0}]},{"title":"What were the dynamics that led to Caesar and Pompey falling out, and Pompey moving towards the support of the optimates in the lead up to the civil war?

Back in 56\/55, they had worked together to install Pompey and Crassus as consuls for a second time (the previous being 70 BCE), and Caesar and Pompey (probably, its complicated) got their domains re-upped for another five years -- Pompey in the Spains and Caesar in Gaul. Caesar crossed the Rhine and made his first crossing to Britain in 55, and was generally having a grand old time (the destruction of the forces under Sabinus and Cotta were still to come in Autumn 55). Pompey governed Hispania via legates but retained his base of power via the legions there regardless; meanwhile he could lurk in the environs of Latium in comfort and keep his eye on politics in the Capital. Crassus, meanwhile, got his longed-for command against the Parthians in the East as governor of Syria, to which he departed in the Autumn of 55. All of this had been affirmed at a meeting between the three at Luca, near Pisa (Cisalpine Gaul), back in 56, at which time they had patched up some developing fractures amongst themselves. The triumvirs were not able to get *everything* they wanted and opposition stubbornly hung around in Rome, but for the most part everything was hunky-dory in late 56, throughout 55, and into 54.\n\nIn 54, Caesar's posse and Pompey's posse collaborated to support Memmius and M. Scaurus for consul. They lost, and Caesar was annoyed that Pompey hadn't done a better job on it, but it was really no big deal to them. Meanwhile M. Tullius Cicero had been compelled to come \"on board\" and appears to have shelved at least proposal that would have been annoying to the triumvirate. He also is active in the courts in support of the triumvirs posses in 54. Two events of 54 are sometimes mentioned in this context. The first was the death of Julia, Caesar's daughter and Pompey's wife, in the summer of 54. It is often said that this event was the earliest rift between the two. If so, it began as a tiny crack indeed, because there is not much evidence of a breach between them in the months after. The trial of Gabinius, Pompey's old minion, was high-profile, and there is every evidence that the triumvirs deployed all their resources in his support. Caesar wrote a letter of support; Gabinius was eventually convicted anyway, in a hostile court. Though this must have annoyed both Caesar and Pompey, there is no evidence that it caused a disagreement between them. \n\nThe second event of 54 is the little-known incident of the potential dictatorship. There had been more civil unrest in the latter half of 54, and again the elections were disrupted. The Senate as a whole was very tired of such nonsense and a rumor spread that a temporary dictatorship was being considered. Pompey was the obvious and only choice. Publicly he said no thanks, but he probably had at least some interest in it. We don't know what it would have entailed, but probably something brief and limited (so don't imagine the iron rule of Sulla). If Caesar thought anything of it, there is no real evidence of such. That winter he was very busy with a dangerous insurgency in Gaul. I'm not sure how exactly those two events match up but regardless, the talk of a dictator seems to have been defeated by the *optimates* (see Cicero *ad Q. Frat.* 3.8.4, 3.9.3). Some of the details are pretty hazy, but it was probably not anything major between Caesar and Pompey. Over the winter of 54-53, we find Caesar asking for a loaner legion from Pompey's reserves to help deal with the troubles in Gaul, and this request is granted without any apparent grumbling (Caes. *BG* 6.1). \n\nIn 53, we find Caesar attempting to reaffirm the relationship via a new marriage arrangement. He had no more daughters, but he did have a niece, Octavia. She was already married but no matter. Or, alternately, he offered to divorce his own wife and marry Pompey's daughter. Pompey declined these proposals, for reasons unknown, but instead of being a sign of a rift, Gruen argues it was probably a sign of continued cooperation. Pompey probably rightly surmised that Caesar did not really want to divorce Calpurnia or force a divorce of Octavia, and by declining he acknowledged the good-faith effort while avoiding the unpleasantness. Crassus was killed and his army destroyed in the summer of 53. It had no discernible effect on the cooperation between Caesar and Pompey, at least not in the short term. In the longer term, surely the removal of one leg of the tripod caused some instability. But for now, there were bigger problems. \n\nAgain in 53 chaos reigned around the elections, and again the government was paralyzed. Again there was talk of an extraordinary appointment to right the ship, this time an emergency joint consulship of Caesar and Pompey. Caesar was much too busy in Gaul, and so eventually an unusual sole consulship went to Pompey for 52, a de facto dictatorship in a more palatable wrapper. Pompey spent 52 \"righting the ship\" and also firming up his ties with some old elite power blocs via marriages: himself to the daughter of Q. Metellus Scipio and his son to the daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher. Caesar, enjoying what would turn out to be the calm before a very large and dangerous storm in Gaul, wrote in his commentaries that Pompey's *virtus* had restored order to the Capital. \n\nSo far I have given a done of writing about how Caesar and Pompey were *not* in a rift. I think the question needs some sufficient background, especially regarding some often-mentioned events like the death of Julia. It is really 52 and Pompey's sole \"consulship' that is usually pulled forward as the blueprint of the rift. I will do the rather unorthodoxed and naughty method of referring to a previous discussion of this here. The fact is, in 52 Pompey had also introduced a couple of pieces of legislation which many have looked upon as explanation of the break between Caesar and Pompey. Gruen argues that neither item (the *lex de iure magistratuum* and the *lex Pompeia*) were such. Rather than tread on old ground again, I'll simply link to a long exchange discussion the account of those two items [over here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/7725t9\/julius_caesar_sought_to_extend_his_public_office\/), including the arguments that these measures were probably not as anti-Caesar as they might first appear.  Within the replies there is the discussion of what came in the aftermath of those events of 52, namely the disagreement and ultimately intractable problem of Caesar's ability to stand for another consulship *in absentia.* It was really this point, and the maneuvering of the anti-Caesarian cabal, that forced the two remaining triumvirs into conflict. Neither could back down or offer concessions without the wounding of the other's *dignitas.* So do go over there for that discussion.\n\nMost of the above, and the discussion on the linked thread, can be found in Gruen, *The Last Generation of the Roman Republic*. The ancient sources are Cicero's letters (various, scattered); Dio; Caesar *BG*; Plutarch *Cato* and *Pompey* (though largely unreliable on many points); Suetonius *Iulius* (though again not always reliable); Appian *Bellum Civile*. None of these ancient sources have an extended passage where things are spelled out plainly, however. A bit of mining is required, already done by Gruen.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678578492.0}]},{"title":"Is there a backlog on translating ancient texts?","author":"ten-numb","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11oyqc0\/is_there_a_backlog_on_translating_ancient_texts\/","text":"I\u2019m curious if there is a backlog on the translation of ancient text\/inscriptions (as in hieroglyphs, eastern scripts, middle eastern etc.).

Once there, they were promptly mixed in with the documents from a similar archive found at Nineveh 3 years earlier. In lieu of proper archival practice, the full collection numbers some 30,000 fragments believed to represent about 10,000 distinct texts. Of those fragments, only about a third have even been properly cataloged let alone translated.\n\nSimilar scenarios play out in university and museum archives all over the world. Hundreds of thousands of individual documents, if not millions, remain untranslated. Cataloging and translating take significantly more time for researchers and archivists than simply uncovering and collecting texts do for archaeologists even today. 170 years ago, when many of the grandest and most obvious sites were still untouched, archaeological practices were not nearly as thorough and even more texts were simply collected and taken home before being into storage. This includes everything from extremely well studied languages like Greek and Latin on down. The more obscure the language, the fewer the scholars studying it, the less likely any given text is to see translation.\n\nThe thing is, scholars are also waiting for the next thing. The vast majority of these ancient records are boring, repetitive, and unrevealing. They are administrative records, receipts, and legal preceding. They can confirm conclusions reached by the translation of other tablets, provide more data to support a hypothesis, etc, but very few reveal groundbreaking information. Even fewer are the sort of literary text that captures popular imagination and interest. On top of that archaeologists continue to dig up new, better cataloged, and subsequently more accessible documents. So the same boxes that have been collecting dust for 150+ years remain on the shelves, undisturbed.\n\nAnd none of that accounts for completely undeciphered languages like the Indus Valley Script or Linear A. We can't even begin to translate those until someone figures out how to do it in the first place.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1678601397.0}]},{"title":"By 1500, how common would it have been to have a sword in Europe?","author":"Feisty-Voice6491","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11omge5\/by_1500_how_common_would_it_have_been_to_have_a\/","text":"It's common to the point of being a trope in stuff like song of ice and fire\/game of thrones and other fantasy media for swords to be ubiquitous.

He writes that the base and animalistic predilections of the masses must be channeled and controlled in the struggle to fight off lesser races, in line with \u201cnatural law.\u201d Additionally, orthodox free market economists do similar justifications for propping up business interests by claiming that their economics is fully scientific and based on intrinsic human behaviors. \n\nIn my research I\u2019ve also read Mutual Aid by Kropotkin, along with some other older anarchist texts criticizing free market ideologies, individualism, and the state. I\u2019m looking for something more historical and evidence-based than some of these philosophical writers. \n\nI\u2019ve received a lot of recommendations to read Graeber, James C Scott, and Clastres. For the former two I just worry a little about the pop-science \u201cbig history\u201d stuff, even though those writers seem generally accepted in the academic community. I think something a little more focused may be more useful to me, for example historical evidence of successes through cooperation and reciprocity rather than individualism, or maybe origin points of state control and oppression in various societies.\n \nAny recommendations besides the aforementioned authors, or opinions on their works? \n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678558507.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

The latter twelfth century is when King Henry II begins expanding the common law\/royal jurisdiction to apply to tenants who had previously been solely under the legal\njurisdiction of their lords. I\u2019m not specifically familiar with a case of an appeal about unjust rents but this certainly held regarding cases of lords seizing a tenant\u2019s inheritance, etc.\n\nAt least if your lord had violated some kind of common law right, maybe a written contract or a traditional custom of what obligations\/rent he was due, you could appeal over his head to newly professionalized royal justices, who travelled all over the country searching out abuses of power and trying to stamp out traditional medieval practices like blood feuds and weregild. Henry II specifically charged his justices to take up the claims of individuals who felt they had been wrongly deprived of property by their lord. If the case was taken up by the justice he would impanel a jury of free men and if they decided the property had been wrongfully seized then that was it it had to be returned. And Henry II was a strong king so your lord would have little choice but to comply.\n\nA second option would be to go to the church. The church was dominated by aristocrats sympathetic to their class and itself an often abusive landowner\u2014but it also did attempt to maintain traditional Christian notions of a just price and a moral economy. If your delegation could convince a local bishop or abbot that you were being treated unfairly he would have immense moral power to intervene with your lord or even the king.\n\nThe final option would be revolt. Obviously revolt is pretty dangerous\u2014a lord might have men at arms and military training and if your revolt is perceived as socially disorderly could call in the king and other lords to crush you and impose punishments. BUT if your revolt was more along the lines of resistance\/noncompliance and you loudly proclaimed that you were merely upholding traditional customs and demanding only a fair price necessary to live\u2014keeping firmly within hegemonic cultural ideas of tradition and Christianity\u2014you might have a shot\u2014not at overthrowing your lord, but at forcing him to abandon his new exactions. An in-between solution would be to refuse to pay the exaction until the king had heard your case.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1678557372.0}]},{"title":"Assorted reading list for pre-Mao modern China?","author":"Jay2Jay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ozua5\/assorted_reading_list_for_premao_modern_china\/","text":"Specifically I am interested in China at the turn of the 20th century.

There is lots of coverage of the firebombings of Japan. Even books that are ostensibly dedicated to the atomic bombings (Hersey's _Hiroshima_, Rhodes' _Making of the Atomic Bob_) typically describe the firebombing campaigns in detail as a way to understand on the context for the atomic bombings as well as the direct influence these campaigns had on the actual plannings for the bombings. I find it increasingly odd that people frame the question in this way, without evidence that the firebombings are in fact a neglected topic. There have been important popular discussions of the firebombings (e.g., _Slaughterhouse Five_) for generations now. Who, exactly, isn't mentioning Dresden and Tokyo?\n\nThe deeper question being asked here is whether the atomic bombings are in some way qualitatively different than the firebombings \u2014 are they \"special\" or are they just an extension of a pre-existing morality. The construction of the \"specialness\" (or lack thereof) of the atomic bombings is certainly an interesting historical question. Whether raw casualties matter in that consideration is part of the discussion (Tokyo was a much larger city than Hiroshima, so its casualties were higher even though a smaller percentage of its residents were affected \u2014 does that matter?). \n\nAnyway, I don't think this question is framed in a way that is historically answerable, given that the premise is not actually established.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678580632.0}]},{"title":"How did we got to the emperor>king>prince order of importance?","author":"DrnkenSailor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ok5zs\/how_did_we_got_to_the_emperorkingprince_order_of\/","text":"Emperor and Prince come from Imperator and Princeps, two titles used by Augustus and (most of) the following Roman Emperors as a explicit rejection, even if only nominally, of kingship\n\nAs recently as the 12th century, the English courts were supposedly offended when Owain Gwynedd styled himself as Prince of Wales, because of the title's association with the imperial might of Rome\n\nThen when, how and why did the title of prince got demoted in the popular imaginary and lost its association with the idea of Empire and emperor, when once those titles were associated?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678541178.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

In exchange, Llywelyn would pay Simon \u00a320,000, and hold his title in subservience to the King of England.\n\nThis treaty would later be confirmed once again following Simon\u2019s defeat and the re-ascension of King Henry III, after the treaty of Montgomery was signed in 1267.\n\nThis resulted in the Prince of Wales title nominally being of a lower rank than the king of England, although Llywelyn notably had a greater degree of independence than many of his surrounding Marcher Lords, such as the ability to freely build castles.\n\nIn 1301, following the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1283, the king of England would name his son as the Prince of Wales, once again reviving the title, but now placing it as the direct predecessor to the king of England.\n\nI hope this is sufficient to demonstrate why, in England, the title of Prince became lesser to that of King. It likely played out differently in other regions of Europe, so hopefully other can provide different contexts.\n\nSources:  \nDavies, J. (2007) A History of Wales.\n\nPryce, H.

The simple answer is that specialists in Achaemenid history almost universally agree that the Achaemenids followed a form of Zoroastrianism. The biggest debate within Achaemenid studies circles at this point is over the exact jargon used to describe Achaemenid religion, which I'll address below.\n\n>it appears early Achaemenids followed Babylonian paganism \n\nThis is the simple misunderstanding. The famous Cyrus Cylinder portrays Cyrus the Great not just as a worshipper of Marduk, but as the Babylonian god's chosen leader, and other contemporary documents reference Cyrus and Cambyses partaking in Babylonian religious rites. I've [written about that before](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/lnbymk\/do_historiansarcheologists_think_that_cyrus\/) on here. This is not evidence of Cyrus doing anything beyond trying to appeal to his newly conquered subjects. The Biblical book of Isaiah portrays him as a messiah of Yahweh who wanted to renew the Jewish temple. Herodotus references Cyrus' patronage for Greek oracles and temples. Egyptian records show Cambyses performing his duties as pharaoh in the Apis bull ceremony and adopting Egyptian throne names to praise local gods. Performing the local religion was a political tactic.\n\nNow for the outdated or misleading things you're likely to find online or in older scholarship. First and formost in figuring this out, we have to establish the lifetime of Zarathustra (aka Zoroaster). This is also something [I've answered before.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/m6scdq\/what_are_the_arguments_and_overall_views_on_when\/) There was once more debate about this, but that really hasn't been the case in the last 30-40 years. Modern academic consensus is that Zarathustra spoke c.1200-1000 BCE. However, you'll often find dates closer to 600 BCE, especially in older scholarship. As discussed in this answer, this is drawn from Middle Persian Zoroastrian sources with infamously unreliable dates for most events and historical figures they portray.\n\nIf Zarathustra had lived around 600, just before Cyrus, then this question would be easy, but alas. Now we should deal with the related ideas that Cyrus the Great and the Medes before him were not Zoroastrian. Both, especially the latter, are based on tenuous evidence that is usually dismissed in modern Achaemenid Studies. Aside from Cyrus' post-conquest proclamations in Babylon and a few similar inscriptions from Cambyses in Egypt, we have no primary sources from the Iranian kingdoms prior to Darius the Great. Nothing about those few sources suggests much about religion, so we turn to archaeology and outside sources, mostly Herodotus' *Histories* and the fragments of Ctesias' *Persika* in this case.\n\nThe principal evidence used to argue that Cyrus and his Median forbearers were not Zoroastrian is the presence of horse sacrifices around his tomb and references in the Greek sources to a religious divide between the Persians and the \"Median\" magi caste\/tribe. This is taken alongside the Mihr Yasht, an Avestan hymn to the divnity Mithra in Zoroastrianism. The Mihr Yasht is one of, if not the, oldest hymn of its kind, and Mithra's significance in both Zoroastrianism and the Indic Vedas suggests he was already an important and popular deity before Zarathustra's time. This once led some writers to suggest that Mithra, traditionally praised with sacrificial horses, was the primary god of Cyrus and the Medes.\n\nThat idea fails on a few accounts. Firstly, the early research was heavily influenced by Roman Mithraism, which historians increasingly understand has little to do with actual Iranian tradition. Second, Zoroastrianism is not monotheistic. Mithra is revered alongside Ahura Mazda, and in fact is specifically associated with the passage between life and death. Worship of Mithra at Cyrus' tomb is hardly surprising in that regard. Finally, the supposed religious division between the Magi and the Persians does not seem to have existed outside of the Greek imagination. Instead, by the very early reign of Darius the Great, the title Magush was fully integrated into the existing local priesthoods, officiating for a wide variety of Iranian divinities.\n\nInstead, modern Iranian or Zoroastrian Studies specialists tend to think that Zoroastrianism probably came with the initial Iranian tribes from Central Asia c.900 BCE or followed close behind them. There's no evidence of a sudden religious reform. In fact, by the time Darius the Great took power in 522 BCE, there's some evidence to suggest that Zoroastrianism was so entrenched that he, and later Xerxes, criticized other Iranians for not following its doctrine. Once again, [something I've discussed](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/syq6ti\/comment\/hyu1og2\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) before. \n\nThe \"big\" debate now, is over whether we can call it Zoroastrianism before all of the orthodox beliefs of the Sassanid period emerged (and to briefly answer that aspect of the OP: The Sassanids explicitly made it their state religion).  Personally, I'd argue that yes, we can call it Zoroastrianism in the Achaemenid Period. It was after Zarathustra's revelation, even if the Avesta itself was still developing under the Acahemenids. I'm also not a fan of the suggested alternative of \"Mazdaism,\" referencing the chief Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda without the suggestion of later orthodox dogma. Zoroastrian communities themselves use the Avestan phrase \"Mazdayasna,\" literally Mazda-worship to describe themselves. So, drawing a line between Mazdaism and Zoroastrianism in Achaemenid studies does not sit well with me.","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1678548502.0}]},{"title":"Why are the top five global financial centers (New York, London, Singapore, Hong Kong & San Francisco), in addition to nearly all financial centers in the top 20, located near major ports?","author":"blackholsn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11p3vl1\/why_are_the_top_five_global_financial_centers_new\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678591390.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

The two largest were the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and Communist Party of Germany (KPD), a center-left and Marxist party, respectively, and both stridently opposed Nazism during the Weimar period. They were, in fact, both eliminated early on specifically because they'd been some of the Nazis principle opponents in the game of German mass politics; starting after the Reichstag fire in February 1933 and wrapping up by the end of summer that same year, first the KPD (who were blamed for the fire and partisans of which had been consistently fighting SA members in city streets for years) and then the SPD (who had tried prevent the passage of the Enabling Act, which allowed Germany's chancellor to legislate without involving the Reichstag or president) were systematically and violently purged. And, considering that the SPD and KPD were the second and third best-performing parties, respectively, after Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) in the previous November's national elections and that they collectively held a 3% advantage over the NSDAP in the Reichstag prior to their 1933 dissolutions, one could hardly call them \"disenfranchised smaller parties\".\n\nThat 3% edge didn't count for much in practice, though, because--even though both the SPD and KPD were openly and actively anti-fascist--the only people that they hated more than Nazis were one another. This was due in part to the standard, expected tensions between moderate social democrats and revolutionary Marxists. But, more saliently, it was the result of some *exceptionally* bad blood still lingering from the SPD's alliance with right-wing *friekorps* units in support of Germany's postwar interim government against the KPD-led Spartacist uprising of 1919, a choice of allegiance which the KPD's bitter memory of as having been a bloody-handed and world-historic betrayal of both the working class and the international revolution would make any practical alliance between themselves and Germany's moderate left a categorical impossibility -- even in the face of Nazism. The KPD's increasing subordination to Soviet policy via its membership in the COMINTERN, along with its Weimar-era leader Ernst Thalmann's personal support for Stalin and hatred of the SPD (the threat posed by which he once compared to a forest which \"the Nazi tree\" mustn't be allowed to overshadow), didn't exactly help matters. In that sense, the two parties are sometimes characterized as having aided in the Nazi ascendancy--albeit wholly unintentionally--since the combination of their individual prominence in German politics and inability to form an effective united front basically guaranteed that there could be no substantive political opposition to Hitler's electoral coalition of fascists, nationalists, and conservatives and reactionaries of various stripes.\n\nAnd it was, indeed, those smaller *right-wing* parties which supported the Nazis only to find themselves dissolved and their membership largely absorbed into the NSDAP once Hitler's grasp on the levers of state power was firm enough for him to finally dispense with those last vestiges of republican-governmental theater.\n\nIf you're interested, the second volume of Kotkin's seminal biography of Stalin goes into some depth regarding the role of Stalin and the COMINTERN in shaping the political conflicts within the Weimar-era left, and Schumann's *Political Violence in the Weimar Republic 1918-1933* is a close-in look at the struggles between Communist, Social Democrat, and Nazi partisans in Saxony during the period. There's also *Between Reform and Revolution: German Socialism and Communism from 1840 to 1990*, which is a sweeping edited collection but does pay quite a lot of attention to SPD-KPD relations during the Weimar era.\n\n\\[edited for typo in final paragraph\\]","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678579133.0}]},{"title":"How did Elsie MacGill come to be known as the first female aeronautical engineer?

A US citizen who wishes to leave the US can usually do so legally, with no need to defect. If the US citizen has dual citizenship, it's usually even easier for them to leave the US to permanently live elsewhere.\n\nThus, there isn't a US equivalent to the defection of ordinary citizens from the former Soviet bloc. You don't need to escape if you can just leave freely. Most cases of defection by US citizens involve desertion from the military or escape from the US by criminals. A few others are defection by US citizens in sensitive employment (other than in the US armed forces) and spies.\n\nDefection has a long history in the US, and there is one very famous example: Benedict Arnold, who defected to the British in 1780, during the Revolutionary War. As a general, he remains the highest-ranked military defector from the USA (ignoring soldiers who chose sides during the Civil War). Arnold wasn't the only officer who defected during the Revolutionary War (e.g., Colonel Rudolphus Ritzema defected in 1776).\n\nThe next-most-famous defector, or perhaps even the most famous, was Lee Harvey Oswald, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1959. He legally entered the Soviet Union on a visa, and remained. He never renounced his US citizenship (but had originally planned to), and in 1961 decided to return to the US. In 1962, he returned with a Russian wife (they had married in April 1961). It was in 1963 that he became famous, when he assassinated president Kennedy.\n\nBy far the largest number of US defections were during the Vietnam War. There were about 500,000 cases of desertion, mostly temporary and mostly by repeat offenders [thanks to u\/Anekdota-Press for the correction!]. Many permanently deserted the US armed forces, and many of them defected (with Sweden and Canada as their main destinations). In addition, many US citizens defected to avoid conscription, mostly to Canada. An estimated-by-Canada 30-40,000 draft-dodgers and deserters moved to Canada, quietly admitted by the Canadian authorities through normal immigration channels. Other estimates put the number as high as 100,000 (largely due to differences in who to count as a \"draft-dodger\"). About 1,000 went to Sweden, two-thirds of them deserters, where they were granted political asylum. Others went to Mexico and Britain, and at least one draft-evader defected to China. One deserter defected to North Korea.\n\nAnother large group of defectors is US citizens who fled to Cuba. Prominent among them are members of the Black Panthers, who fled to Cuba to avoid murder and\/or arrest. Notably, the Cuban government had supported the Black Panther movement, and readily gave asylum to their members. Other significant elements among these exiles are Puerto Rican independence activists and defectors from the CIA. Cuba was an attractive destination since it was nearby, and with Cuban-US relations being what they were, they could be confident that they would be allowed to remain in Cuba if they could reach there. The US government regards many of them as terrorists or common criminals, while they see themselves as political refugees who sought to avoid the fate of Fred Hampton (of the Black Panthers, murdered by the FBI and Chicago police). Prominent members of this group of 100-200 defectors include: Nehanda Abiodun (Weather Underground, Black Liberation Army (BLA), 1981 Brinks robber), Philip Agee (CIA), William Lee Brent (Black Panther (BP)), Eldridge Cleaver (BP), V\u00edctor Gerena (Puerto Rican insurgent), William Morales (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional Puertorrique\u00f1a (FALN)), Huey Newton (BP), Assata Shakur (BLA), Frank Terpil (CIA), Robert Williams (NAACP, allegedly framed for kidnapping by the FBI in 1961, his writings helped inspire the formation of the Black Panthers).\n\n* In 1794, David Bradford, lawyer and politician, fled the USA to avoid arrest for his role in the Whiskey Rebellion. He escaped to Spanish West Florida (now Louisiana). He was pardoned by President Adams in 1799, but continued to live on his new plantation is Louisiana. He did visit the US, and his family moved to live with him on his plantation.\n\n* In 1846, John Riley, Irish-American US soldier, deserted and escaped to Mexico (accompanied by fellow soldier Patrick Dalton). The joined the Mexican Army, and formed the Saint Patrick's Battalion (AKA Batall\u00f3n de San Patricio, and later the Foreign Legion of Patricios) as a unit of the Mexican Army, commanded by Riley. The battalion fought against the US during the Mexican-American War. Most of the battalion was of European origin, most not US citizens, but included a significant minority who were and had deserted from the US Army. Many had deserted during the war, and many were Irish-American Catholics - anti-Catholic discrimination often partly motivated their desertion and defection. After the war, 72 Americans from the unit who were captured were tried for treason, and 50 were executed (48 by hanging). Riley was tried for and convicted of desertion rather than treason (since he deserted before the war), and was flogged and branded. At least one captured American member of the battalion was murdered by his captors. The battalion and its members are still honoured today as Mexican heroes.\n\n* In 1899, David Fagen, African-American US soldier serving in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War, defected to the Filipino rebels, probably motivated by the combination of anti-African-American racism, anti-Filipino racism, and the extreme brutality of the suppression of the revolt (in which torture was freely used by the US forces, and over 200,000 Filipino civilians died). He became a captain in the Philippine Revolutionary Army, and led a unit of guerillas against his former fellow soldiers for the next two years. Another 20 US soldiers also deserted to the rebels, many of the them also African-American, and some served under Fagen's command. Fagen is still a folk hero in the Philippines.\n\n* In 1944, Martin Monti of the US Army stole a plane from an airfield in Italy, and defected to the Germans. His motivation was to fight Bolshevism, and he joined the SS (he worked in propaganda rather than as a front-line soldier). He is the only known American to defect to the Axis in WWII.\n\n* At the end of the Korean War in 1953, POWs were exchanged by the two sides. Of the approximately 3500 US prisoners held by the north, 23 decided to remain rather than be repatriated. Two of them changed their mind during the 90 day \"cooling off\" period, and were repatriated, with the other 21 remaining (most of them eventually returned to the US). In 1954, the 21 were moved to China. The 2 returnees were court-martialled for their initial refusal of repatriation, and each served about 4 years in prison. The US Army dishonorably discharged the other 21, and discovered, perhaps to their unwanted surprise, that they were therefore unable to court-martial them as they returned to the US.\n\n* In 1960, William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, who both worked as cryptologists for the NSA, defected to the Soviet Union (via Mexicon and Cuba). Their stated motivation: extreme concern over the NSA conducting spy flights over Soviet airspace, without the knowledge of Congress.\n\n* In 1961, Ollie Harrington, African-American civil rights activist who had been living in Paris since 1951 sought, and was granted, political asylum in East Germany. He feared assassination by US agents, believed that was what had happened to his friend and fellow exile-in-Paris, anti-racist African-American writer Richard Wright, who died in 1960, allegedly murdered.\n\n* Five US servicemen stationed in South Korea are known to have defected to North Korea in the post-war period by crossing the DMZ: Larry Abshier in 1962, James Dresnok in 1962, Jerry Parrish in 1963, Charles Jenkins in 1965, and Joseph White in 1982. The first four of these became well-known in Korea through the film industry - they played the roles of evil Americans in films, and appeared in propaganda films. Jenkins planned to defect to the Soviet Union, but was imprisoned in North Korea for almost 40 years. A 6th American, Roy Chung, deserted from the US Army in West Germany, presumably choosing North Korea as his destination because he was an ethnic Korean.\n\n* In 1965, Glen Rohrer deserted from the US Army and defected to Czechoslovakia","upvotes":278,"created_utc":1678499061.0},{"author":"Anekdota-Press","text":"The primary reason we hear far more about defections from communist countries is due to scale.\n\nIn the first 15 years of the cold war prior (until about when the Berlin wall was built), roughly 20 million people emigrated or fled from the Eastern Bloc. Though the bulk of this movement took place in the first few postwar years, and the new communist governments were not the only reason for flight. Some emigrants were more generically fleeing war devastation or were among the fleeing\/expelled ethnic Germans.\n\nThere is some movement in the early years from West to East Germany as families reunite, or by those enthusiastic about the DDR\u2019s government. But it was only ever a fraction of the movement the other way, and the asymmetry became greater over time. As the Eastern bloc imposed greater border controls, emigration to the west slowed but still amounted to several million people over the next three decades, far exceeding movement in the opposite direction.\n\nThe initial surge of emigration caused the eastern bloc to impose strict border controls and emigration rules. While ordinary people in the west could emigrate to the east, very few chose to do so. In contrast, movement out of communist countries tended to risk death or severe punishment, but millions still took the chance. Indeed, defections from North Korea and Cuba occur right up to the present day. Dramatic defection from the west was typically limited to those who had committed espionage or political violence in the West.\n\nBut the asymmetry reoccurs at other points. Roughly two-thirds (about 14,000 of 21,000) of Chinese POWs during the Korean War refused repatriation to the PRC and were instead repatriated to the ROC (Taiwan). In contrast only 23 of the 3,500 American POWs refused repatriation, settling in China in 1954. And almost all the American defectors returned to the US by 1966.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cLike in the Vietnam war, there must have been a handful of US soldiers who had just had enough and defected to the Viet Cong, because they were subject to shit\u201d\n\nAlthough overall instances of desertion quadrupled during the Vietnam war, very few of these took place in the combat theater. Of the 3 million Americans who served in theater (in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) during the war only 249 deserted, and only a fraction of these defected to communist countries.\n\nIt is also inaccurate that 500,000 US servicemembers deserted during the Vietnam war. There were some 500,000 instances of desertion (30 day absences) but these involved fewer than 100,000 personnel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefection and emigration went strongly in one direction during the cold war, and it seems the books and media you have chosen to consult reflect that general trend.","upvotes":33,"created_utc":1678525545.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678494046.0}]},{"title":"Robert Curthose was imprisoned for almost 30 years prior to his death.

It was an important moment for the development of the Anglo-Norman state, since it directly resulted in the reunification of the family's Norman and English landholdings. By winning the battle, and capturing his brother, Henry simultaneously nullified the most potent threat to his rule in England and was able to quell remaining  opposition to him among the Norman aristocracy, allowing the remainder of the duchy  to fall easily and rapidly into his hands. The English royal family's continued possession of substantial lands in France would considerably complicate the history of the period until at least the reign of John, a century later.\n\nBoth contemporaries and historians have thus shown considerable interest in Curthose, in his relationship with Henry, and in the battle itself \u2013\u00a0but they have shown considerably less fascination with his subsequent long imprisonment, for the obvious reason that he never emerged from it and was never again a significant rival to his brother. What we do know is that Henry must have considered that Curthose remained a major potential threat to him. Of the other senior prisoners captured after Tinchebray \u2013 who included William, count of Mortain, Robert II of Stuteville, William II Crispin and the Saxon pretender to the English throne, Edgar the Atheling \u2013 only Robert II and William were kept imprisoned alongside Robert Curthose, like him,never to be released.\n\nWe know only a little bit about where and how Curthose was confined. He was sent first to Wareham in Dorset, which *probably* (but see below) means he was confined in the royal motte-and-bailey castle built some time after the conquest in one corner of the Saxon fortified *burh* of the same name. Shortly thereafter he was moved on to Devizes in Wiltshire, where he lived in a major castle controlled by Henry's leading supporter Roger of Salisbury, a Norman priest who held the bishopric of Salisbury and is most noted for being the presiding genius behind the royal exchequer system \u2013 an advanced financial administrative operation whose early development was one of the most significant features of Henry's reign. Devizes, according to the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, was the most splendid castle in the whole of Europe at the time, and certainly, as a lordly residence, as well as a defensive fortification, it would have offered accommodation fitted to the tastes and expectations of the Norman elite.\n\nCurthose stayed in Devizes until 1126. In that year, however, he was transferred again to the custody of Henry's bastard son Robert of Gloucester, in his castle in Bristol. This was done, according to the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, on the request of the king's daughter and heir, the Empress Matilda, apparently in anticipation of a possible challenge to her eventual succession \u2013\u00a0Robert of Gloucester was her half-brother, and would be a leading ally in the civil war she fought against an actual rival claimant, Stephen, after Henry's death. At some point thereafter, un-noted by the chroniclers of the period, Curthose was moved across the Severn estuary to Gloucester's castle at Cardiff, where he died in February 1134, aged 83 or 84. His survival to what was, for the time, such a remarkably advanced age, in itself suggests sustained good treatment during his captivity. Henry subsequently paid for his interment in the abbey at Gloucester \u2013 John of Worcester says the burial took place with great honour directly in front of the altar \u2013 and funded the monks there to say perpetual masses for his brother's soul.\n\nWe should not imagine that Curthose was  kept in close confinement or in shackles all those years. Henry's modern biographer, Warren Hollister, comments that he \"evidently dwelled in considerable luxury\", and certainly his incarceration would have been more comfortable than that of his ally William of Mortain, who was confined in the Tower of London, England's contemporary equivalent of a maximum security facility. The elites of this period had a concept known as *libera custoda* (\"free custody\"), which amounted to a form of house arrest under which prisoners were not kept under lock and key, but instead gave their word of honour not to abscond, and it seems likely that this was the system under which Curthose was confined. Aird suggests that it is possible that, in the same manner as that of other high status political prisoners whose word could implicitly be trusted, Curthose  accompanied Roger of Salisbury as he travelled about on his royal and episcopal duties, and there is even a hint, in the disbursements recorded in the 1129 pipe roll which is the sole survivor of the detailed accounts kept in this period, that he may have attended the royal court at Westminster in that year. According to the well-informed and normally reliable Anglo-Norman monk Orderic Vitalis, Henry informed Pope Callixtus II in 1119 that\n\n>I have not kept my brother in fetters like a captured enemy, but have placed him as a noble pilgrim, worn out by many hardships, in a royal castle, and have kept him well supplied with abundance of food and other comforts and furnishings of all kinds.\n\nOne reason for all this would have been Curthose's high status, both as a noble and as one of the leaders of the First Crusade, but another was that the prisoner evidently, in Hollister's words, \"cooperated fully and most obligingly\" in helping to facilitate his brother's takeover of Normandy, offering tactical advice on how best to nullify remaining baronial opposition in the duchy.\n\nNonetheless, the picture is not *entirely* rosy, and there are some indications that Curthose would at minimum have been aware of the potential for worse treatment should his conduct change. His modern biographer, Bill Aird, wonders whether or not the Norman castle at Wareham had actually been built by the time the chroniclers note Curthose's confinement there \u2013\u00a0if it had not, he says, the most obvious place for Robert to have actually been locked up was the nearby castle at Corfe, which was where the Saxon king Edward the Martyr had been assassinated, probably on the orders of partisans of his own younger brother \u00c6thelred II, in 978. \"Perhaps,\" Aird speculates, \"Henry's choice of Wareham was intended as a reminder to his brother that there was a worse fate than imprisonment.\" This seems quite a stretch to me, but it's certainly the case that both Matilda and Robert of Gloucester were tougher characters than Henry was, and hence it is possible that Curthose's treatment at Bristol was at least marginally more harsh than it had been at Devizes. But Henry was still king then, and remained so until after his brother's death, so it seems implausible that Curthose would not have been very well-treated overall throughout his long confinement.\n\nStill, there are counter-currents here that we should not neglect. Aird notes that the version of Curthose's captivity that Henry gave to Callixtus might have been \"special pleading\", designed to reassure an angry pope about the conditions that such a highly renowned servant of the church was being kept in. And far more ominously, from this perspective, there are some late records suggesting he was actually the victim of atrocities. These accounts are *so* late that they are probably not accurate, and certainly it is impossible to corroborate them from contemporary records which we really might expect to mention them if they had actually taken place. But it remains the case that the late 12th century chronicler Geoffrey of Vigeois offers a variant account in which Robert was at some point freed by Henry, but attempted to raise an army against him and was locked up once again \u2013 which, if true, would almost certainly have meant harsher incarceration. Still later accounts, written by Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris in the early 13th century, both supply the story that Robert attempted an escape in 1119 and was blinded after his recapture to prevent any recurrence. Aird mentions both these versions without significant comment, but he does not appear to place much trust in them.\n\nHenry might have released Curthose at some point \u2013 he was urged to do so in 1119 after he also succeeded in capturing his brother's son and potential heir, William Clito. For his part, Clito begged for their release, promising that he and his father would take themselves off to Jerusalem, and never return to northern Europe. But while Henry agreed to release Clito, he refused the request to liberate Curthose, and Hollister concludes that the latter's 30-year-long incarceration was a \"prudent act\" on the king's part, \"contributing decisively to the tranquility of the realm and the reduction of suffering and death among his subjects.\"\n\nCertainly Henry's decision to release both William Crispin and William Clito did lead to renewed trouble for him in Normandy, which was something that he abhorred. \"Peace he loved and kept, perhaps more successfully than any previous prince in the annals of western Christendom,\" Hollister says of Henry. Curthose's long but surely comfortable confinement, we are invited to conclude, was a very small price to pay for this.\n\n**Sources**\n\nWilliam M.

We can make some more broad assumptions based on related early works like the Rig Veda for general lifestyle and cultural information, but that won't tell us anything about Zarathustra\/Zoroaster himself.\n\nZarathustra is never given a rank or title in the Gathas, and most of the titles used are exclusively negative. They seemingly all refer to the existing religious hierarchy that resisted his reforms and new doctrines.\n\nThe two statements listed are already seemingly at odds with one another. \"Zarathustra was not a member of any of these castes\/orders\/hierarchies and no such hierarchy existed at the time.\" I assume the author means that there was no priestly institution within Zarathustra's followers. That at least appears to be true. It's at least never described. Whether that was by the prophet's intention or simply because it was a small community, centered on religion that didn't need an organized priesthood yet is harder to say. There's at least some vague hint that it might have been the former in how early Zoroastrian hymns use the word *saoshyant.* Literally meaning \"one who brings benefit,\" later Zoroastrians used The Saoshyant to mean a sort of messianic figure, but the Gathas use it in a general sense for the end state of all good believers, not unlike the idea of a Bodhisattva in Buddhism. \n\nThis still leaves the distinct possibility that Zarathustra started life as something similar to one of the other early Iranian titles. It would explain his apparent familiarity with religious ceremony even before his revelation. However, it's still never stated in surviving texts and commentaries.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678580427.0}]},{"title":"Are there any oral legends or \"urban legends\" that continue to be told today from historical events like the Black Death or old religious prosecutions?","author":"TheRockButWorst","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11oh0h3\/are_there_any_oral_legends_or_urban_legends_that\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678531178.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Too often these various meaning have been elided into one another.\n\nAround the early first century BCE, Romans began referring to certain peoples in northern Europe as *Germani*. The origins of this word are uncertain. It may have originally been an ethnic name used by some people in the region or a term that some Gauls used to refer to a foreign people. The term was redefined by Julius Caesar in the mid-first century BCE in his *Gallic War* as referring to all of the people who lived east of the Rhine River, as opposed to those who lived west of it, whom Caesar defined as Gauls. Caesar's division bore little relation to the cultural reality of the region, which was inhabited by a wide variety of mostly small-scale societies. Those Caesar called \"Galli\" and those he called \"Germani\" did not have any such sense of collective identity, but it was useful to Caesar and other Romans to think of them as two separate groups. Caesar's ethnology continued to shape Roman ways of thinking about northern Europe. Following Roman writers continued to use the term \"Germani\" in a broad sense to refer to the various peoples who lived along the Rhine and upper Danube frontiers, although they could be vague about which groups the term applied to.\n\nBetween Caesar's conquests in the mid-first century BCE and the chaotic crises that struck the Roman Empire in the mid-third century CE, societies on the borders of the Roman world did not remain static. Rome exerted military, political, and economic pressure against the peoples on its frontiers, and those peoples gradually adapted to be able to better protect themselves and their interests. Successfully dealing with Rome meant finding ways to bring multiple separate societies together into large, stable alliances that could mobilize resources on a larger scale, conduct diplomacy on behalf of their people, and face the Roman army on something more like an even footing. The process of forming these alliances was not easy, and it took a lot of time, but by the mid-third century, the nature of the Roman frontier had changed.\n\nThese alliances choose names to identify themselves. Some were old ethnic names repurposed as collective names, like the Goths in the Black Sea region or the Noubades south of Egypt. Others were tribal names claiming descent from a common ancestor, like the Lakhmids and Ghassanids in Arabia. Others were self-descriptions, like the Franks (\"bold ones\") or the Juthungi (\"young fighters\") in northern Europe. Some defined the allied group outright, like the Quinquegentannei (\"five tribes\") in North Africa. All of these alliances were formed in the context of the Roman frontier and were connected to the Roman world. Some were consistently aggressive against Rome, and others made lasting alliances with the Romans, but most could vary between friendship and hostility as the needs of the moment and the attitudes of the Romans dictated.\n\nThe groups you mentioned--Franks, Vandals, and Ostrogoths--were a few of these frontier alliances who had long histories with Rome. Like other such allied groups, they were originally defined not by ethnicity but by common political interests. Over time, they probably formed a sense of collective identity, which some of them may have chosen to think of and express in ethnic terms, but if so, the relation between these new \"Frankish\" or \"Gothic\" ethnicities and the old ethnic groups of the lands in which they formed was complicated and tenuous. It often makes more sense to think of these groups as being analogous to the private armies that Roman generals and nobles could command as they competed for power in the empire. Goths, Lakhmids, and Noubades were competing for power in the same ways and within the same greater-Mediterranean arena as Rome's rival generals.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, scholars of many fields embraced the idea of ethnic groups as coherent units, stable across time and defined by certain inherent traits. In an age of European imperialism, historians explained history as the result of discreet ethnic groups invading, conquering, and displacing one another. Historians looking back at the late Roman period reinterpreted these frontier alliances as coherent ethnic groups impinging on and fighting over the Roman Empire. Since the idea of European peoples expanding and conquering appealed to European scholars living in expansive imperialist nations, historians of the time tended to focus particularly on the frontier alliances that emerged on Rome's European frontiers and disregard those that appeared elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, linguists were discovering language families and learning how to connect languages to one another by common descent. A sub-family of related languages emerged including English, Dutch, German, the Scandinavian languages, and others, including what could be reconstructed of Gothic. In concert with historical thinking of the time, linguists believed that these separate languages must be the descendants of the original language of a single people living in northern Europe, in the areas Roman writers had identified with the Germani, so they named this language family \"Germanic.\" Historians in turn incorporated the idea of this ancestral language into their picture of European history, making it one of the defining traits of a pure, primordial northern European ethnicity. Any individual or group whose name appeared to be derived from this same ancestral language was categorized as \"Germanic.\" Since they were \"Germanic,\" they could therefore be assumed to have shared in the other traits that historians believed defined the \"Germanic\" people, such as a warlike spirit and a superior physique. These theories got brewed together with the blossoming field of \"racial science,\" ultimately leading to terrible consequences in the twentieth century.\n\nWe now know that the nineteenth-century image of \"Germanic\" peoples sweeping into the Roman world, pure and untouched from a northern European homeland, is a figment of the imagination. Modern historians are much more cautious about how we use the term. We generally apply it today as either a loose catch-all term for the peoples on Rome's Rhine and upper Danube frontiers whom the Romans called Germani, or as a linguistic term, meaning those people who--to judge from whatever linguistic evidence we have about them, like runic inscriptions or personal and place names--appear to have spoken a language in the Germanic sub-family of Indo-European. These meanings are ill-defined and have sloppy edges. They sometimes overlap, but are not the same. In the past several decades there has been a movement away from using the term at all when talking about the late Roman frontier alliance groups, since it is both inexact and leaves out a large part of the picture. Some historians still use the term, though, and it appears in a lot in popular history.\n\nFor the kind of history that it sounds like you're reading, it would be better to ignore the term \"Germanic\" and think of the various groups mentioned as loose alliances of people formed in contact with the Roman Empire who were just as engaged in the contest for power, wealth, and prestige as any other group in the Roman world.\n\nSources:\n\nAmory, Patrick. *People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489-554.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.\n\nDignas, Beate, and Engelbert Winter. *Rome and Persia in Late Antiquity: Neighbours and Rivals*.

Or how Southern attitudes to enslavement changed from 1776 to 1861? I got interested in the subject a few weeks ago, and, honestly, was expecting to see members of the Confederacy government predominately view themselves as a *continuation* of the Founding. Yet, looking at the primary sources, many of the leading Confederates seem to openly *mock* and\/or *attack* much of the Declaration of Independence or Constitution. (Particularly the notion that \"all are created equal\")\n\nI'm sure many people here are familar with the \"Cornerstone Speech\" by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens in terms of the Lost Cause and the mythology that the Confederacy wasn't fighting over slavery.  It's been extensively quoted in terms of this paragraph:\n\n> Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. \n\nYet I haven't seen many comments on the *rest of the speech*... which also makes a significant amount of claims \u2014 in a \"history of ideas\" way \u2014 that I haven't seen mentioned or analyzed by essentially any political scientists, historians, or commentators, but are in my mind very interesting in terms of current politics and debates surrounding the Founding.\n\nWhile it's often assumed that the Confederates saw themselves as successors to the American Revolution, it appears to me - and I might be wrong here - that many of them *openly* contested both the Declaration of Independence and parts of the Constitution and\/or saw their ideals in *contradiction* to it as well.\n\nFor example, the *New York Times* reports Stephens [stating:](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1861\/03\/25\/archives\/the-starvation-humbug-again.html)\n\n> In the fourth place, and this is the principal and most important point of all -- we have settled, and, I trust, settled forever, the great question which was the prime cause of our separation from the United States -- I mean the question of African Slavery. -- ***The old Constitution set out with a wrong idea on this subject; it was based upon an erroneous principle; it was founded upon the idea that African Slavery is wrong, and it looked forward to the ultimate extinction of that institution. But time has proved the error, and we have corrected it in the new Constitution.*** We have based ours upon principle of the inequality of races, and the principle is spreading -- it is becoming appreciated and better understood; ***and though there are many, even in the South, who are still in the shell upon this subject, yet the day is not far distant when it will be generally understood and appreciated -- not only in the South, but everywhere else. The world is rapidly progressing in its views on this subject, and in a very few years we may witness great changes in respect to this institution.***\n\nSimilarly, in [the Cornerstone Speech](https:\/\/sourcebooks.fordham.edu\/mod\/1861stephens.asp) he states:\n\n> The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions\u2014African slavery as it exists among us\u2014the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the \"rock upon which the old Union would split.\" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.\n\n> ***The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error.*** It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it\u2014when the \"storm came and the wind blew, it fell.\"\n\n> Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. ***This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago.*** Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man.... I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man. The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, ***I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.***\n\nIt's interesting that Stephens is saying here that the \"errors of the past [Founding] generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago [1841]\". Implying that even many Southerners were aware of the contradictions of continued enslavement at the time of the Founding - and that white Southern attitudes towards slavery apparently transformed from a \"necessary evil\" in 1789 to a positive good by the time of 1861. Notably, even Jefferson, who would seemingly be one of the Founders that would be quotable by the Confederate government, is seemingly seen by Stephens as more of an *enemy* than friend. Other leading quotes from officials in the Confederate administration make similar negative quotes on the Founding - including even a half-hearted wish that they remained in the British Empire - describing the \"old Constitution\" and the \"Declaration\" as \"the Founders mistakes\" and \"rejection of the natural order\". Many even mock figures such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, *et al.*.\n\nThis definitely wasn't what I was expecting going into the primary literature.\n\nIs there any good resources on:\n\n* Did Southern attitudes on race and slavery evolve between 1776 and 1861?\n* Did the Confederates view the American Founders and documents positively?  Many seem to criticize the original Founding, and particularly figures such as Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and, strangely enough, Thomas Jefferson. \n\nIs Stephens being hyperbolic here? Or was the \"prevailing view\" at the Founding truly that:\n\n> that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678557123.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

But, as far as i know (I study law here), in the constitution from 1991 (see [here, English](https:\/\/www.sobranie.mk\/the-constitution-of-the-republic-of-macedonia-ns_article-constitution-of-the-republic-of-north-macedonia.nspx)) Albanians already had the same rights as the start of the conflict (see: the preamble of 1991). \n\nWith the finish of the conflict, the Ohrid agreement happened to amend the constitution (amendment ix was made - which replaced the preamble of the constitution of the (then) Republic of Macedonia from 1991; all the way to amendment xviii). My con. law prof. says that this framework changed the constitution from a modern, liberal democratic to a consociational constitution, where the sovereignty didn't originate from the citizens anymore, but from the ethnic blocks\n\nSo, why did the NLA start attacking Macedonia, and what were its goals?

I mean,  well,  its a series afterall, but still in reality that Mr. Magellan  went from his home country Portugal (which he served very well and loyal  until then) to the king of Spain and that king was quite open to the  idea to give a lot of money to a foreigner, for a discovery of an  alternative passage. So that makes it look quite important in reality as  well.\n\nBut looking at maps the  difference between the Strait of Magellan and Drake Passage doesnt seem  to be all that impressive, especially not if you are already sailing for  multiple months anyway, if not for years.\n\nI  also couldnt find any informations on german and english wikipedia or  even google,  besides obvious facts like \"well the straits connects both  oceans\", aha so does the Drake Passage.\n\nWas  it because of the very strong east winds on drake passage ? Were winds  already so much lower at the end of the magellan strait ?\n\nFrom  what I could read the straits usage after the discovery wasnt so high  anyways, but the search for such an strait rather was, I just wonder  why.

So if you are asking why the discovery of Drake's Passage is important there are several reasons. I haven't watched the show you are referring to I don't understand what particular time period it is in.\n\nThe Strait of Magellan is actually quite a hazardous passage with narrow channels, unpredictable strong currents, and lots and lots of fog. At some points the strait is only about a mile across, this means going SLOW as those ships could not turn very well in close quarters. You could be stuck sitting in fog for days, take a wrong turn at any of hundreds of inlets, or crash into rocky outcroppings. At the time of being discovered, it was assumed this would be the fastest crossing and no one saw a pressing need to explore further south, though the journey still took some sailors four months to traverse. It was far from ideal. Remember they did not have good maps or understanding of geography so they had no reason to believe that there wasn't just much more land down south. Most of the early passages through here were met with many losses, Drake himself lost four of his ships when on his voyage.\n\nDrake's Passage is substantially simpler to get through but also comes with its own perils. 40 foot waves, seasonal ice, and the fastest free flowing water in any ocean. They say there are two types of weather in Drake's Passage: the Drake Lake or the Drake Shake! The Lake being calm flat waters and the Shake being complete chaos that sent thousands of sailors to meet Davey Jones. Drake's passage is considered the most dangerous stretch of ocean in the world.\n\nIt really boils down to the Strait of Magellan being a perilous and SLOW journey, and Drake's Passage being a much quicker journey albeit with a fair share of danger as well. Drake's Passage is also much safer in certain seasons so you could plan accordingly to mitigate risk Meanwhile the Strait of Magellan is full of hazards year round and are unpredictable. In terms of setting up a new trans oceanic shipping passage, Drake's Passage is the clear favorite. Spain controlled most of the overland transport of good from the Pacific to the Atlantic, so to be competitive, other European nations had to find overseas routes to get in on plundering the Pacific.","upvotes":32,"created_utc":1678504391.0}]},{"title":"How responsible were the British Royal Family for colonialism, Empire and the corresponding evils?","author":"Blade106","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ojgbx\/how_responsible_were_the_british_royal_family_for\/","text":"People often point to the evils done by the British Empire as being a reason to condemn the Royal Family, but my understanding is that they had waning political power by that point in history.

During World War II, S.L.A. Marshall studied the combat effectiveness of the American GI. Based on hundreds of after action interviews conducted with rifle companies in Europe, he came to his famous conclusion that:\n\n>In an average experienced infantry company in an average stern day's action, the number engaging with any and all weapons was approximately 15 per cent of the total strength. In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25 per cent of the total strength from the opening to the close of the action.\n\nThis was a *huge* deal, and as you allude to set the US military on a path of overhauling their training in an effort to raise firing rates and the general willingness to shoot the enemy.\n\nMany people are probably best aware of the whole matter through the Black Mirror episode which is a direct reference to these findings, the title borrowing from Marshall's book, published in 1947 as *Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command in Future War*.\n\n**The problem is that his book is based on bullshit**. It is generally concluded at this point that he conducted far fewer interviews than he claimed, and that he never actually recorded the information on which he claimed to have based these statistics. No notes, correspondence, or other papers which can be used to reconstruct his data survive, and what information he did offer in the years after is misleading and contradictory. Roger Spiller's 1988 article is one of the most important of several take-downs of Marshall's work, and from which I will quote:\n\n>In Men Against Fire Marshall claims to have interviewed \"approximately\" 400 infantry rifle com\u00adpanies in the Pacific and in Europe, but. that number tended to change over the years. In 1952, the number had somehow grown to 603 companies; five years later, his sample had declined to \"something over 500\" companies. Those infantry companies-what\u00adever their actual number-were his laboratories, the infantrymen his test subjects, and at the focal point of his research was the ratio of fire. \"Why the subject of fire ratios under combat conditions has not been long and searchingly explored, I don't know,\" Marshall wrote. \"I suspect that it is because in earlier wars there had never existed the opportunity for *systematic collection of data*\". (Italics added by Spiller).\n\n>Opportunity aplenty existed in Europe: more than 1200 rifle companies did their work between June 1944, and V-E day, 10 months later.  But Marshall required by his own standard two and sometimes three days with a company to examine one day's combat. By the most generous calculation, Marshall would have finished \"approximately\" 400 interviews sometime in October or November 1946, or at about the time he was writing Men Against Fire.\n\n>This calculation assumes, however, that of all the questions Marshall might ask the soldiers of a rifle company during his interviews, he would unfailingly want to know who had fired his weapon and who had not. Such a question, posed interview after interview, would have signalled that Marshall was on a particular line of inquiry, and that regardless of the other information Marshall might discover, he was devoted to investigating this facet of combat  performance. John Westover, usually in attendance during Mar\u00adshall's sessions with the troops, does not recall Marshall's ever asking this question. Nor does West\u00adover recall Marshall ever talking about ratios of weapons usage in their many private conversations. Marshall's own personal correspondence leaves no hint that he was ever collecting statistics. His surviving field notebooks show no signs of statistical compilations that would have been necessary to deduce a ratio as precise as Marshall reported later in Men Against Fire. The \"systematic collection of data\" that made Marshall's ratio of fire so authoritative appears to have been an invention.\n\nNow, the irony is that Marshall probably wasn't *wrong*. Even Spiller, in his piece, concludes that Marshall likely was trying to create a scientific backing from what he felt more intuitively from \"his own experiences and observations of war\". He certainly conducted interviews, and certainly talked with many soldiers, and even if he made the numbers up, he did have the sense that many soldiers *were* refusing to fire, and this needed to change. So he was full of shit and in complete violation of academic ethics... but he was motivated by what he saw as good reasons, namely a boot to the butt of the US Army to improve things. In reality, we really have no idea what the number was, as at absolute best it was a rough guess, and he could have been quite far off both in numbers and reasons. In any case, it is a fairly serious problem with Marshall's work, one which casts a serious shadow on it and one which any subsequent researcher using it must grapple with.\n\nWhich brings us to the other issue I want to address... Marshall was in large part discredited after Spiller's article, and at best used with caution. And regardless, since *Men Against Fire* was published, better, more honest works which explore the same issues of combat motivation have come out such as Glenn's *Reading Athena's Dance Card: Men Against Fire in Vietnam*, Kellet's *Combat Motication: The Behavior of Soldiers in Battle*, or Engen's *Strangers in Arms: Combat Motivation in the Canadian Army*, but these don't pique the conventional psyche. Two factors are of note. One is the appeal it has for the image of the citizen-soldier, a reluctant warrior. In his article on combat motivation, Daddis lays a fair bit of blame at the feet of Stephen Ambrose and his *Band of Brothers* for its fixing this in modern American minds. I won't disagree.\n\nBigger though is Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, whose book *On Killing* was, in comparison to more academic works on the topic, a much more accessible work for the general reader. It also commits the same sins as Marshall, although perhaps more inexcusable in that it is so *obvious*, in that he has his conclusion and tries to fit evidence to it. He cherry picks information, ignores what he doesn't agree with, is absolutely terrible about good citing practices, and for our purposes here, *uncritically used Marshall's numbers as accurate and uncontroversial*. I would tentatively argue that Grossman is single-handedly responsible for resurrecting Marshall and giving his work a new, and undeserved life. Although he did eventually publish a response to critics, which you can read [here](http:\/\/www.journal.forces.gc.ca\/vo9\/no4\/18-grossman-eng.asp), but is fairly evasive and doesn't really say anything in his defense. Grossman had parlayed his success into more books, and a post-military career as a lecturer to police and military groups which is not really for discussion here due to the 20 year rule, but suffice to say, he has no real motivation to be academically honest at this point, and in my estimation, it shows. \n\n1\/","upvotes":1226,"created_utc":1678383579.0},{"author":"King_of_Men","text":"While you wait for a new answer, perhaps [this older thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/2od6eg\/ive_heard_that_during_the_first_and_second_world\/) with an answer by \/u\/Georgy_K_Zhukov will interest you; it covers some of the debate about both *On Killing* and *Men Against Fire*.","upvotes":57,"created_utc":1678382960.0},{"author":"clear_haze","text":"You can read Ordinary Men by Christopher Browning.

It is also true that *usurious* lending was nominally prohibited \u2013 but this went through a period of evolution, both theoretically and in practice. Studies about the effectiveness of prohibitions are hard due to ununiform practices (e.g. Cannon law was not uniform territorially even on basic things like divorce *in practice* throughout late medieval Europe) and research, but the issue of usury certainly was litigated throughout Europe and there was a genuine but uneven effort to it. Secondly, usury has a specific meaning and should not be equated with interest or other legitimate payments on the principal (poena detentori, damnum emergens,\u2026) associated with lending \u2013 the latter categories were never at issue, barring centuries long contentions about interests specifically as *lucrum cessans* \u2013 these developments expanded with burgeoning *Ius Commune* and Canon law. But scholarly and theoretical categories lived a somewhat separate and parallel life from rich day-to-day practice with slow, gradual and unequal both convergent and divergent currents between the two into the early modern period. Likewise, ecclesiastical courts and tribunals played as active role as any other in private third party creditor-debtor relations where they had jurisdiction (either subject-matter or territorial as lordship due to extensive property holdings). Banking was not limited - Jewish lenders were actually in a more precarious position due to their unequal legal standing - not to mention frequent expulsion, persecutions, etc. and easier defaults by debtors for the reason stated above due to a more limited legal recourse (legitimation) of Jewish creditors.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLiterature on the subject is extensive, but e.g.\n\nMell, J.

German formations used similar means of transport that the soldiers of other countries used: walking on foot, travelling with horse carts (the reputation of the Wehrmacht as a highly-motorized army did not reflect the experience of the average infantryman for much of the war, with each German infantry division relying on thousands of horses), travelling in motorcycles, civilian-style automobiles, military-style automobiles, trucks of varying sizes, tanks (both inside and on top of (though the latter usually unplanned)), the train network, and even air travel. Certain German soldiers would have been more naturally likely to have experience with some of the more specialized types of redeployment than others: the paratroopers were obviously familiar with military transport planes (with the Ju-52 model receiving the cheerful nickname \"Aunt Ju\"), and tank crews would undertake much of their combat travels within their tanks (though out-of-combat redeployments of tanks were usually done in rail transport).\n\nGenerally, redeployment that was planned and scheduled by the Germans themselves and that happened outside of combat conditions would be undertaken by rail. Railroads and trains have numerous advantages: they can transport large numbers of people with a great degree of coherence, and they can transport even heavy military equipment in a cost-efficient and safe manner (this was especially important for Germany's famed heavy tanks, which had infamous weak spots in their internal engineering and whose engines were prone to be in need of a full replacement every few hundred kilometers, meaning that redeploying from Germany to western Russia via road travel might kill the first engine before the Red Army was even in sight; also, railroad bridges are sturdy enough to safely carry heavy tanks, which was never certain to be true for many smaller road bridges). Railroads have their disadvantages too: they make for large targets (with the railways being static and easily identifiable even if hard to hit by a high-altitude bomber plane), and embarkation as well as disembarkation requires time as well as a well-secured train station at both start and destination. This means that the railroad is less useful in operational-level combat conditions, and almost useless in tactical-level combat conditions.\n\nSo if the Germans were forced to redeploy out of combat necessity, the railway was not an option. Anyone who was part of a vehicle crew would of course stick with that vehicle unless there was a good and pressing reason to abandon it, but infantrymen were often out of their luck. This is where the famous photographs of half-dozens (or more) German infantrymen sitting atop German tanks: they are either offensively redeploying and moving from one local battle to another local battle, or (increasingly likely in the later years of the war) they are withdrawing from an advancing enemy.\n\nYou asked about the Western and Italian fronts of 1944\/45. The Western Front especially became a war of movement after the Allied breakout of Normandy in July\/August 1944, and the Germans were soon rushing to reach the 'border of the Reich' (that is, the boundary between what was \\*de jure\\* Germany and merely occupied France\/Belgium) to get ahead of the Allied advances. Especially Allied airpower made road travel difficult, however, and especially German infantry formations, but also the armored divisions (ever facing high demands by German high command due to their high combat value) were prone to fall victim to the superior Allied ability to move their forces quickly and safely. The Falaise Pocket is the most infamous example during the 1944 campaign; more pockets such as the Ruhr Pocket and Harz Pocket would follow in 1945, and several coastal fortresses along the French coast, secured by 'static' (\"bodenst\u00e4ndig\" in German) infantry formations became so-called 'fortresses' immediately upon D-Day \u2014 some of these French coastal fortresses were later among the last Wehrmacht forces to lay down their weapons, with some not doing so until 11 May 1945, three days after Germany's unconditional surrender.\n\nYour question could also be read in a way that you ask \"would it be feasible for a German soldier to fight on both the Italian front and the Western front?\". That was absolutely feasible, though not overly common: the two theaters were organized under different army groups (the highest-level German military formations) meaning that formation-level redeployments from one to the other required central command to order them. Individuals might more easily be swept from one theater to the other. Wounded soldiers in the Wehrmacht were assigned to specialized recovery formations at home, and might be drawn upon by another theater than the one they were wounded at; additionally, high-value individuals such as pilots, doctors or staff officers might also be more quickly reassigned. Such individuals would then usually travel either by the rail network or, in the case of high-value individuals, by motor car.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678489416.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-1,"created_utc":1678483593.0}]},{"title":"are there any first hand accounts of conquistadors committing atrocities other than de las casas book(s?)?","author":"EnvironmentalBit7882","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11o3zcz\/are_there_any_first_hand_accounts_of\/","text":"Are there any first hand accounts of conquistadors committing atrocities other than from de las casas?

(She\u2019s very thorough in her research, but she is being a bit anachronistic here.)\n\nThe major work (still) on the period is Laverne Kuhnke\u2019s \u201cLives at Risk,\u201d which is about the development of public health in Egypt under Mohammad Ali Pasha (1805-48); it\u2019s not a bad benchmark as Egypt was probably the most developed country in the Islamic world in this regard (Iran and the Ottoman Empire weren\u2019t as far behind as rumored but Egypt was in the lead). Most surgery was performed by a barber surgeon who had rudimentary training \u2014 in the Islamic world as in Europe, surgery had been separated from physical medicine in the Middle Ages. Doctors dispensed medicine and recommended surgery but the actual surgeon was a tradesman who learned by doing.\n\nKuhnke doesn\u2019t have much to work with \u2014 our major source for that period (which, coincidentally is where City of Brass begins) is the Description of Egypt written by members of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s expedition (1798-1801). They didn\u2019t have a lot positive to say about Egyptian doctors but also didn\u2019t really recognize that medicine in rural France was about at the same level (meaning: rudimentary at best). We get a sense that the surgeons weren\u2019t going from patient to patient like the battlefield surgeons in every Civil War movie you\u2019ve ever seen, but it probably wasn\u2019t much better. Instruments may have been dunked in water, as might hands, but it also probably wouldn\u2019t have been clean water changed out between dunkings (hands would, as washing them in running water is a requirement for prayer). \n\nThe water also wouldn\u2019t have been boiling, etc, as germ theory wasn\u2019t proven til later (as you point out). \n\nAll of which to say is that there might have been perfunctory steps to wash instruments or hands, but, in a clinical sense, they wouldn\u2019t have been clean.","upvotes":25,"created_utc":1678476502.0},{"author":"critbuild","text":"I have not been able to identify evidence necessarily specifying hand-washing or boiling of instruments as techniques for disinfection prior to surgery in Muslim history. However, medical journals do identify an awareness of the principles of disinfection by prominent Islamic scholar-physicians.\n\nFor example, Abu Bakr al-Razi, who lived in the 9th-10th centuries CE, is most famous for the discovery of ethanol, which he reportedly used as a disinfectant and antiseptic. More specific to surgical disinfection, al-Razi is known to have used mercury as a wound antiseptic and fresh liquid of bile to disinfect surgical tools.^1 More generally, medical journals tend to attribute to early Islamic physicians an understanding of antisepsis and particular disinfecting agents predating the Middle Ages.^2,3\n\nInterestingly, multiple articles I reviewed for this question lamented how difficult it was to get clear answers about the history of Islamic medicine. Confounding factors include cultural ties, the tendency for medical history to focus on (historically) recent innovations, and the relative lack of sources or work on the subject by modern authors.^4 In particular, sources describing the history of surgical disinfection often referred to three seminal works in Islamic medical history:\n\n* The Comprehensive Book on Medicine by Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (latinized as Rhazes)\n* The Method of Medicine by Ab\u016b al-Q\u0101sim Khalaf ibn al-'Abb\u0101s al-Zahr\u0101w\u012b al-Ansari (latinized Albucasis)\n* The Canon of Medicine by Ibn Sina (latinized Avicenna)\n\nUnfortunately, these works largely appear to lack English translations.\n\nSo to answer your specific question, I did not find sources positively identifying hand-washing or boiling of surgical tools, but there appears to have been a general awareness of the need for antisepsis and some techniques to achieve it long before the 19th century.\n\n\n----------------------------\n1.

Would it require the owner's permission? Could a slave effectively be more wealthy than a free citizen? Did slaves have any rights, or perhaps certain \"strata\" of slaves?\n\nThis isn't something that you see in popular depictions of slavery in the American South, which of course due to recency bias is what many of us think of when we think of slavery.\n\nMore importantly, what's the functional distinction between a slave, versus an indentured servant, versus other types of workers who were bound in contracts or to the land in such a way that they would have no real freedom to leave? Because depending on what region you read about, it seems like serfs were worse off than slaves of antiquity.\n\nAncient Chinese and Middle Eastern eunuchs and concubines are also of interest, since there are historical accounts of these kinds of people who \"legally\" appear to be slaves, but were able to wield a vast amount of political power.\n\nBonus Hypothetical: Since ancient slavery was not race-based, how would someone \"know\" if you were a slave, versus a freedman, versus just a foreigner? Couldn't you just run away and get to another province? I mean it'd be hard travel, but surely it would be worht your freedom?\n\nLastly, if anyone has any references on the historical institutions of slavery around the world, I'd be happy to look into them.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678474367.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

The answer is yes and no and it depends a lot on your own definition of \"social climbing\", it helps to view and understand hierarchy in most medieval societies as both horizontal and vertical.\n\nLet me explain: most social climbing in medieval societies is based on moving up in your own social class, there is very little need or want to *climb* to another social class. But that is because, at least in part, those societies have a very different idea of the place of the individual in the world. You could be a rich merchant or a poor merchant, but you remained a merchant. You could be a rich peasent or a poor peasent, but you remained a peasent. You could be a rich noble or a poor noble, but you remained a noble. Competition would take place within the class and about something class specific, like guilds, or the court.\n\nOf course, these are by no means egalitarian societies, but societies where horizontal groupings occupy as much space, if not more, than groups based on vertical links. It should also be emphasised that in these 'barbarian' societies, the very idea of hierarchy does not refer to a cascade of dignities and functions distributed by the state, as was the case in the Roman world of the Late Empire and as is found in the entire Byzantine state apparatus. It is striking to note that few people, generally specialists in the regions directly inherited from the Roman world, Visigothic Spain and Ostrogothic Italy, have sought to penetrate the meaning and practice of hierarchy in societies whose ideology still refers, more than elsewhere to the system put in place by the emperors of late antiquity. There are even rarer exceptions who based thier reasoning on Irish sources reflecting a very particular way of conceiving the world and society, mist people when they talk about hierarchy in the middle-ages tend to talk about the Carolingian period, when a real reflection, initially theoretical, on hierarchy emerged, and when the royal power tried to 'put society in order', particularly from the 9th century onwards.\n\nIt is indeed the writings of the Carolingian world that give us access to the essence and forms of medieval hierarchy as they are understood by most people. More than the imperial nomenclature inherited from the Lower Empire, it is the model of the angelic hierarchy that the scholars of the Carolingian world turn to most readily when they are looking for a model of hierarchy.\n\nThe hierarchy is therefore primarily of divine origin, assigning each man his place in this world, while preserving the idea of the unity of the community. This search for hierarchy being based mostly around the hierarchy of Heaven as scholars understood it at the time. This hierarchy is not opposed to the community, but is on the contrary what makes it possible. At the same time, we can think of a theory such as that of the three orders rests above all on the concern to warn the elites against an overestimation of themselves, to the benefit of a discourse that promotes the dependence of the hierarchical orders on one another, within the hierarchy willed by God.\n\nAnd, in that superposition of the immaterial and the material worlds, if the divine origin of hierarchy allows the community to constitute itself, it also allows societies to be hierarchical to each other, Christian society responding to the model of divine hierarchy being, as a result, the only one that can be considered authentically human.\n\nThis effort at conceptualisation specific to the Carolingian period was naturally accompanied by a desire to establish efficient forms of hierarchy within society itself: First of all, through the monastic experience, which moves from an ideal of equality in the community to a hierarchical ideal based on the clerical model, whose hierarchy imposes itself rather quickly as a reference model.\n\nHierarchy also manifests itself within 'horizontal' relationships such as the guilds, who emphasises that even within structures that are supposed to promote equality and solidarity between its members, numerous strategies of distinction can develop. For example, the desire to reinforce hierarchical structures within the rural clergy had to rely on the recovery of horizontal ecclesiastical solidarities.\n\nThere remains the problem of the articulation between the hierarchical thinking produced by the clerics, which was intended to provide the ideological basis for the Carolingians' work of \"putting things in order\", and the perceptible forms of social hierarchy, which also obeyed other criteria that founded social distinction.\n\nThese criteria essentially reflect the relationship that an individual has with the whole of society and first of all with himself: at the very bottom of the hierarchy, we find those who do not even have their own bodies, a sign systematically interpreted as that of unfreedom. We must also take into account the individual's relationship with legitimate authority, which, most of the time, is aimed at consolidating his or her social position, which is also absolutely necessary to maintain a lasting position in the hierarchy. Moreover, it is not only a question of belonging to a public hierarchy, but also of playing an intermediary role between local communities and the 'central' power, which may not necessarily have an interest in supporting the most powerful elites, but may also favour a partnership with elites from a less prestigious background but, as a result, less restless.\n\nNot surprisingly, one of the determining criteria is the relationship an individual has with the person of the prince: the possibility of gaining access to the prince's favour and royal proximity are both a means of reinforcing the power of the elites and a powerful ferment of social mobility within this polymorphous hierarchy. Aulic hierarchy acts as a screen between the king and his subjects, even if this hierarchy still retains a fluid and poorly codified character, especially when compared to its Byzantine counterparts. Nevertheless, we are struck by the effort made by the Carolingians to establish a quasi-legal link between the king and his subjects thanks to the generalisation of the oath of fidelity which crowns the whole system.\n\nSo, God has given you your lot in life, you are a peasent. God has not decided though, if you were doomed to be rich or poor.\n\nYour absolute best bet to truly rise above your station is to either accumulate wealth or join the religious establishment. The later being better. You could also roll the dice and join a military campaign, where if you of survive and are in close contact with your lord, something lucky might happen and you save or impress the right person.\n\nL.

Without getting too much into \"American exceptionalism\", the rise of the United States from being a collection of colonies hugging the coast of North America to the most powerful state in the world in the span of about 150 years is unique. You can just look at a map and see this. In terms of \"former colonies\" there is really no other nation that can even remotely compare to America's dominance, and there never has been. Sure, countries like Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Argentina are all part of the G20 and are firmly middle powers in global affairs, but they are nowhere close to having the level of global hegemony that the United States has. The only former colonies that could *maybe* someday even manage to reach great power status are Brazil and India, but those are big maybes and involve a lot of contemporary economic and political factors that would likely be breaking the 20 year rule, so I will say nothing more. \n\nBut this is dealing with the more modern idea of \"colonies\". In ancient times, \"colonies\" were far different than how they are currently understood today. In the ancient world, colonies were essentially completely separate political entities from their mother country, with the only real bonds being somewhat close relations and alliances. Sometimes colonies were founded by exiles from a city being forced to found a city of their own. One of the greatest \"colonies\" in the ancient world was Syracuse.\n\nSyracuse was founded by colonists from Corinth in the eighth century BCE, and it quickly grew to become one of the greatest cities of the ancient world. The fertile lands of Sicily allowed it to quickly grow into a thriving metropolis, and by the fifth century it had surpassed all mainland Greek cities in population, and became the largest city in Europe. Cicero said it best in his speeches against Gaius Verres, a Roman Governor of Sicily who allowed Syracuse to be sacked.\n\n>You have often heard that the city of Syracuse is the greatest of the Greek cities, and the most beautiful of all. It is so, O judges, as it is said to be; for it is so by its situation, which is strongly fortified, and which is on every side by which you can approach it, whether by sea or land, very beautiful to behold. And it has harbors almost enclosed within the walls, and in the sight of the whole city, harbors which have different entrances, but which meet together, and are connected at the other end. By their union a part of the town, which is called the island, being separated from the rest by a narrow arm of the sea, is again joined to and connected with the other by a bridge.\n\nSyracuse was a major player in the Punic Wars, and even after the Roman conquest it continued to be one of the most important cities in the Mediterranean. It even served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire in the seventh century CE for a few years after Constans II chose to reside there instead of Constantinople. Although it was later surpassed by Palermo as the center of political and economic power in Sicily, it remains to this day a major city.\n\nContrast this with its mother city, Corinth. Corinth was a major city state in Ancient Greece, but its fortunes were far worse than Syracuse's. Although it did serve as the namesake of the League of Corinth during the early years of Macedon's domination of Greece, once Alexander began his conquests they were firmly under imperial domination. They did make a minor comeback during the era of the Achaean League, but after the Battle of Corinth established Roman domination of Greece, that was pretty much it for them. Corinth did serve as the Roman province of Achaia's capital, but that was the last time they were truly relevant on a large scale. Following multiple destructive earthquakes and a major sacking by Alaric and the Visigoths towards the end of the fourth century CE, the city fell into obscurity for centuries, eventually becoming a regional capital of several Byzantine themes and gaining a thriving silk industry. Today, the city known as Corinth isn't even the true Corinth. After other destructive earthquakes over the centuries, an entirely new city was built miles away from the old city.\n\nSo to answer your question, yes. The United States is unique in terms of a modern era colony reaching the level of global hegemon in such a short amount of time. But in the ancient world it was not unheard of for colonies to rival if not surpass their mother cities. Another great example is Carthage (which I will not go into here, this comment is long enough), a Phoenician colony, becoming arguably the most powerful political entity in the Mediterranean for a period of time, having territory stretching from Africa to Sicily to Iberia.","upvotes":175,"created_utc":1678427323.0},{"author":"omniatlasmaps","text":"There are several ways to look at your questions, so I'll answer a few of them.\n\nBefore I do that, I'll establish some rough baselines. The United States declared independence in 1776, became a regional continental hegemon in about 1865, extended its hegemony to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America in around 1901 (Hay-Pauncefote Treaty), became the premier world power sometime between 1919 and 1945, and became a global hegemon in 1991 (with the end of the Cold War).\n\nGoing with these dates, which are of course open to debate, the US went from independence to regional hegemony in 89 years, to premier status in 143\u2013169 years, and to global hegemony in 215 years.\n\nNow let's move on to the different ways of seeing your questions. The first is the narrowest interpretation:\n\n**Has any former colony risen from gaining independence to global hegemony as quickly as the United States?**\n\nAs only one other country, the United Kingdom in the 19th century, has ever achieved an equivalent level of hegemony as the US, the answer is clearly no.\n\nHowever, as your second question simply asks about \"examples of quick ascensions in power\" we can broaden the interpretation:\n\n**Has any country risen from gaining independence to regional hegemony as quickly as the United States?**\n\nThe answer here is yes, and it's possibly even historically common.\n\nThe Achaemenid Empire of Persia, for instance, began with Cyrus' revolt against the Median Empire in 553 BC and by 524 BC had extended its control from the Iranian Plateau to Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. In short, the Persians had gone from obscurity to regional hegemony in 29 years, one-third of the time it took the United States.\n\nSome 700 years later, the Sasanian Persians replicated this feat, going from a dependency of the Parthian Empire to a power capable of sacking Roman Antioch and capturing the Roman emperor Valerian in about 40 years.\n\nAnother, non-Persian, example is the Dutch, who in the Eighty Years' War (1566\u20131648) went from mounting an insurrection against Habsburg rule in the Netherlands to becoming one of Europe's foremost economic and naval powers, with hegemony over Indian Ocean trade and dominance over much of Southeast Asia.\n\nThis pattern, where regional hegemony is established in 1\u20132 generations, occurs with some frequency throughout recorded history. If we loosen the requirement for independence to disunity or a state of weakness, the Romans from their invasion by Pyrrhus to their establishment of hegemony over the Mediterranean (280\u2013189 BC), the Arabs from Muhammad's return to the zenith of the Rashidun Caliphate (622\u2013654), the Mongols from unification under Genghis Khan to an empire extending from Eastern Europe to China (1206\u20131259), and the Spanish Empire from the union of Castile and Aragon to the Iberian Union (1469\u20131580) all expanded from relative obscurity to hegemony fairly rapidly. Even Britain, which emerged from the instability of the mid-17th century to become a global hegemon in some 127\u2013173 year (1642\/1688\u20131815), did so in a time period similar to the United States.\n\nSo, in summary, the answer to your first question in yes, the rise of the United States to global hegemon has been unprecedented historically. However, the answers to your second and third questions are also yes, other powers have also risen dramatically in importance, in many cases even more quickly than the US.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678572220.0}]},{"title":"Did FDR\/Allied Powers' knowledge of Unit 731 play a part in the Japanese-American Internment Camps?","author":"DemandTop","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11obmud\/did_fdrallied_powers_knowledge_of_unit_731_play_a\/","text":"I am not well versed in this section of history.

There are a wide variety of English-speaking jurisdictions that are significantly more conservative than Ireland (eg. many parts of the United States, as well as the United Kingdom in some aspects) and there are many non-English speaking nations that are more progressive. This is ignoring the colonial roots of many of the most socially conservative and regressive laws in place globally, such as bans on gay marriage or even being gay itself - in the case of Ireland, these socially conservative laws were legacies of legislation imposed during Ireland's period as an English colony, for example the 1861 *Offences Against the Person Act* which was a law passed in Westminster, not Leinster House. These often came hand-in-hand with the forced imposition of the English language. I would also point out that the dynamics of being a member of the Eastern Bloc, that is, a Soviet client state, were very different to that of literal foreign occupation and colonialism, but that is a different question altogether.\n\nI would also state that Ireland's shift in this regard is both not as clear cut as is portrayed and is also so recent as to fall outside of the scope of historical discussion and ventures into the world of analysis of ongoing political and social developments. If we were to operate within the scope of the 20 year rule of r\/AskHistorians then the most recent social development in Ireland we can discuss is the rising xenophobic sentiment in 2003 (which culminated in a referendum that stripped people of birthright citizenship in 2004 - a decidedly conservative, right wing development).\n\nA posited theory for Ireland's increasing social liberalism is due to age demography in Ireland, but the numbers do not support this hypothesis. For example, the number of under-24s in Ireland from 1986 to 1996 reduced by 1.5%, whereas for over-45s it increased by 1.6%. This trend only accelerated subsequently.\n\nAnother theory is that Ireland's membership of the European Union forced social questions more into the centre of politics, whereas before they could largely be ignored - but this ignores that the issue of abortion was one of major debate and was constitutionally banned in 1983 - largely in response to conservative Catholics who campaigned on the issue out of fear that the Irish Supreme Court could make a similar ruling to that of Roe v. Wade in the United States. Furthermore, when looking at this comparatively to Poland, they are both EU member states and therefore it's hard to point to EU membership as a primary explanatory factor.\n\nWith regards to Poland, the shift with regards to social norms is easier to discuss within the scope, but again I would hesitate to ascribe a general descriptor to Poland as being \"more socially conservative\". As with Ireland, it is not clear cut and it is still something in ongoing development. However, the existing trend that you're observing began with the fall of communism. \n\nI'm going to take abortion as a test case. It was broadly legalised by the Polish Sejm in 1956. Initially, it required the consent of three physicians, and the criteria included rape, foetal deformations, and \"difficult living conditions\". The last one is important - Polish abortion legislation changed several times between 1956 and 1990 but in the vast majority of cases, the reason given for requesting an abortion was on the basis of difficult living conditions. What amounted to \"difficult living conditions\" varied and broadened with time, up to the point where in practice it was essentially left up to the pregnant person to determine, so long as they found a physician willing to carry out the abortion. \n\nWith the collapse of communist government in Poland, this trend reversed and abortion began to be actively restricted, and in 1993 it was further restricted with the removal of the \"difficult living conditions\" clause, that is, the clause under which most abortions were accessed to begin with. It also threatened physicians who performed abortions outside of the allowed scope criteria with 2 years in prison. \n\nHowever, the restoration of capitalism in Poland and the dismantling of the socialist economy naturally resulted in a lot of political instability. In 1994, legislation was passed to liberalise abortion again, and the Polish President refused to sign it into law. In 1995, a new President was elected and new abortion legislation was put forward and implemented - it reintroduced abortion on socio-economic grounds, but imposed a maximum limit of 12 weeks of pregnancy, required a 3-day wait, counselling and so on. For the record, this is more liberal than existing abortion legislation in Ireland as of 2023, which does not allow for abortion on socio-economic grounds. \n\nThe 1995 legislation was ruled unconstitutional in Polish courts in 1997, which pointed out that, in its opinion, allowing for socio-economic grounds for an abortion violated the right to life. The sitting government was 4 seats short of the supermajority needed to overrule the court's ruling, and after the election of a new government that year, the court's decision was implemented and the legislation was amended to remove socio-economic grounds. \n\nIt is worth noting that after the collapse of communism, the Polish United Workers' Party reformed into a social democratic party, and was one of the members of the Democratic Left Alliance in 1991, and along with the (then-left wing) Polish People's Party (the successor of the agrarian socialist United People's Party which legally operated in communist Poland) it managed to form a government from 1993-1997, and it was in that period that an agenda of abortion liberalisation was actively pursued. What this meant is that the legacy of communist rule in Poland was, in many senses, tied up with questions of social liberalism just by nature of the ideological stances involved by the liberal and illiberal political actors. It is with that, that I provide the strong caveat that just because an anti-abortion party gets elected and passes anti-abortion legislation, it does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the majority of the population on the issue, which is why I say it is not straight forward to refer to Poland or Ireland as more or less socially conservative than one another. \n\nThe other theories for alleged divergence that have been put forward is the power of the Catholic Church in both countries, and how in Ireland, the Church's institutional power has been more greatly diminished than Poland. That's a possible theory, but it should be noted that it's difficult to view religion in Ireland and Poland similarly, despite the Catholic Church's historical dominance. The Church in Poland was a major anti-communist force, and by 1991 only 48% of the population attended services regularly (against 79% for Ireland), and rather than an increasing trend of Church attendance in the post-communist period, it has continued in relative stagnation and slow decline (whereas Ireland by 2003 had fallen to 50% attendance).\n\nIn summary, I would say this is a difficult topic to discuss within the scope allowed on this sub, but from what we can discuss I believe there is a much stronger relationship between the fall of communism and Poland's trend towards illiberalism relative to Ireland, as opposed to other factors such as the English language and Catholicism.","upvotes":40,"created_utc":1678465080.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-4,"created_utc":1678454198.0}]},{"title":"Why did Christianity grow so fast in Sub-Saharan Africa during The Colonial Era?","author":"The_Deen1616","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11nzogt\/why_did_christianity_grow_so_fast_in_subsaharan\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678479585.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

I am currently reading it.  \"Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788 \"\n\n\nIt is well researched and in depth. But I am curious if there are any critiques. Her school of though is heavily influenced from the  likes of Wood, Bernard Baiylin and other \"neo-whig\" school of thought. \n\nThis school largely counters the thoughts of those like Charles Beard and other \"progressive\" historians, who thought constitution largely reflected economic interests of the founders and other wealth land owners. \n\nThe issue: Maier's writing style is such that she builds suspense by writing the issue without mentioning future event. So outside of introduction, there is no reference to other scholarship in text. \n\nAnd there is plenty written by Beard, and others like Woody Holton on the constitution prior to the release of ratification, I struggle to find any response or critique in the aftermath. \n\nIf any progressive historians are reading, there is a need for a book on ratification that challenges the neo-whig school that can cite Maier's excellent book.  Since her book is arguably the most comprehensive history of the subject, I think a book that can cite it would be useful. \n\nLink to Maier's book: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ratification-People-Debate-Constitution-1787-1788\/dp\/0684868555","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678488327.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

While I was intrigued by the main points of the podcast, the opening description got me curious about how international travel worked at this time.  I imagine Gautier was fairly wealthy at this time, so I don\u2019t think he was worried about affording the trip.  However, I could see a lot of logistical complications with traveling to another city in foreign empire that has uneasy relations with your own country (after all, France had taken Algeria from the Ottomans only a couple decades before Gautier\u2019s trip). \n\nSo, how would Gautier have planned his trip?  Did he need to exchange currencies, or would French currency at the time been accepted in Ottoman markets?  Did he need to contact a place in Istanbul ahead of time to secure lodging, or could it be expected that he would find lodgings available there?  Did he need to plan travel via steamboat ahead of time, or could he just hit any port, confident that a ship would be heading East relatively soon?  And, once there, how would he communicate with the locals?  Could he anticipate an interpreter would be there, or did he have to bring someone along?  How would he be able to ensure a ship back home?  Finally, were there any equivalents of travel guides that could help him with all this planning?\n\nSorry if this seems like a long list of questions, I\u2019ll take any answers that can touch on even portions of anything I\u2019ve asked, but thank you for taking the time to read and answer!","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678477507.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

From what I've read and listened to it seems like there is genuinely a consensus on what emperors did get assassinated and it seems like these emperors that died in young adulthood (for modern standards) were not in that category.

Their position in the 16th century was already stretching their capabilities beyond what was long term sustainable. They achieved their powerhouse status by continuously being *first*, either in reaching new areas or in using newest ships, learning and developing new skills, creating charts, maps and general experience - basically investing into their maritime and naval activities to be on the cutting edge of technology. But this they could only do until the limit of their resources allowed them, and until other nations, especially ones with overall better socio-economic position, finally caught up.  \n\nThe peak of the Portuguese power is usually given at around mid 16th century, by which time they controlled or had access to various key points and territories scattered through Japan, China, Malacca and Spice islands, India and Sri Lanka, Persian gulf, East and West coast of Africa, Brazil, Atlantic islands as well as a string of fortresses in coastal Morocco, all managed from mainland Portugal. Yet they never managed to conquer all they hoped for. Entrance to Red Sea for instance remained outside Portuguese control, despite being considered of huge strategic importance.  \nThe accepted Portuguese naval supremacy (sporadically tested by local indian ocean rivals with commonly Portuguese victory) was achievable only where their ships could enforce it, and the huge area of Indian ocean and the comparatively few ships Portuguese had created many holes. By the 2nd half of 16th century new trade paths, outside of Portuguese power to regulate, started appearing and increasing in importance. While Portuguese were pretty secure in controlling their areas, they were already unable to counter these new challenges.  \n  \nEconomic base of the Portuguese empire was actually on a weak footing, as the loans needed to maintained of the huge empire and constant fighting, was slowly draining the profits from the trade. Bad years were more and more common, good years more and more rare. Bad economic practices and choices from the Portuguese royal authority, and even worse execution from the selfish, corrupt or incompetent Portuguese personnel on the ground, only made matters worse. With all this in mind it might be more of a wonder how did they hold out so much, rather then why did they fail.  \n\nHowever the central events usually connected to the decline were in Europe and Morocco. In 1578 young and heirless king Sebastian went with an army to Morocco in an ill-fated attempt to rekindle Portuguese involvement in Morocco. The expedition was defeated and king was lost. The defeat has serious consequences. Military, the Portuguese army was crushed. Economically the Portuguese had to pay enormous ransoms to free their captured kin. Political consequences were more important. The throne was ultimately claimed by Spanish king Phillip II and Iberian union of Spain and Portugal was born. The union had little positives for portuguese, and plenty of negatives.   \nThe Portuguese were soon directly involved in the Spanish conflict with the Dutch and the English, and the Portuguese ships participated in the ill-fated Armada campaign. Already praying on the Portuguese, those nations now had an open hand to attack the Portuguese possessions and wrestle control of trade routes for themselves, in which they had much success. Unlike the more traditional Portuguese royal-centred administration, they ( Dutch in particular ) developed a new proto-capitalistic environment with their Company model, which enabled them to raise much more capital, and with it acquire more ships, weapons, everything. It didn't hurt that they were already major centers of commerce, with highly urbanized population with access to whole bunch of northern resources from scandinavia, baltic, germany, and the netherlands and england themselves.   \n\nDutch attacked Portugal on various, well, *all* fronts. They took Elmina on Guniea coast in 1637 . They took parts of Brazil in 1630. In Indian ocean VOC reached indonesia and founded Batavia in 1619 and from there they slowly wrested control of the spice trade and joint forces with various local enemies of Portuguese. After some attempts, with final aid from Sultans of Johor they took Malacca in 1641. Ceylon fell in 1640. The English EIC helped Persians and kicked Portuguese from Hormuz in 1622. Newly risen Omanese finished the job of kicking the Portuguese from Persian gulf from Muscat, and continued to take over Zanzibar in East Africa.   \n\nBut the Portuguese haven't been losing everything. They successfully defended Goa from multiple attacks, as well as kept Macau, Angola, Mozambique. Brazil was recaptured in 1654. Other Indian possessions were defended successfully, but some were later granted to English in exchange for support after the proclaimed Portuguese Restoration.\n\n\nBasically the Portuguese control of the Indian ocean in the 16th century was based on their monopoly on naval power. Once that power was no longer theirs alone, and by 17th century it wasn't, the many deficiencies were laid open. The direct conflict of the Old (Portugal) and the New (Dutch, England) was decidedly win for the new.\n\nThe Spanish rule was less then helpful. The many wars and economic turmoil spanish themselves were experiencing, spread to Portugal. Military, the Spanish weren't any help in the far reaches on Asia and other Portuguese colonies and instead of helping, the king was trying to increase his control and use portugal's riches to fund his own wars. Portuguese used the Catalonian revolt for themselves to proclaim independence from Spanish rule in the 1640, which lead to a state of war with Spain till 1663, end of which coincided approximately with peace with the Dutch in the 1661.\n\nSo by this time Portugal was almost in a state of continuous war with various english, dutch, and spanish for many years. The economic landscape Portuguese were operating in completely changed. The VOC took over the spice trade by taking over indonesia, ceylon and malabar coast and started importing so much spice the prices massively dropped anyway. By this time the new main import item changed to textiles, which English exploited best. Portuguese, mostly but not completly pushed out of the spice and India, and probably anyway more sympathetic to this type of business focused on Brazil, plantations and the slave trade from Africa. This state of affairs remained until 19th century when Napoleon's invasion of Portugal made the royal family move to Brazil. Brazil's independence, end of slavery trade and industrialization (or lack of in Portugal's case) further reduced Portugal's diminished role.","upvotes":52,"created_utc":1678453566.0}]},{"title":"In the 1993 film \"Gettysburg\" the Civil War generals often seem to know exactly what units and what commanders they are facing.

But I know that in real-life one of Brazil's biggest historical disadvantages has been the fact that the Cerrado (the Brazilian tropical savanna biome) has been largely useless for large-scale agriculture up to the 1960s.\n\nThere was both a socio-economic lack and a technological lack that, when solved, allowed the Cerrado to become the breadbasket of Brazil that it is today.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n>Until the mid-1960s, **agricultural activities in the Cerrado were very limited, since natural cerrado soils are not fertile enough for crop production**, directed mainly at the extensive production of beef cattle for subsistence of the local market. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to Bras\u00edlia has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region: From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental subsidy programs were launched to promote agriculture, with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region.As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.  \n**The Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, Embrapa, discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year.** The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equaling around five tons of lime per hectare. **This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area.** Researchers also developed tropical varieties of soybeans, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main soyabeans exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.  \nToday the Cerrado region provides more than 70% of the beef cattle production in the country, being also a major production center of grains, mainly soya, beans, maize, and rice.\\[33\\] Large extensions of the Cerrado are also used for the production of cellulose pulp for the paper industry, with the cultivation of several species of eucalyptus and pines, but as a secondary activity. Coffee produced in the Cerrado is now a major export.\n\nThis all was made possible by the gradual transfer of technology from advanced countries such as the US and Europe to the Global South in the 1950s onwards, iirc.\n\nNow, I don't think the development of tropical varieties of temperate crops such as soybeans could happen before genetic manipulation becomes a thing, and it does right from the 1960s onwards. But what about industrial methods to lower the acidity of the soils with lime and phosporus? What about large-scale, mechanized, industrial agriculture? I'm sure those technologies did exist in the Global North before they reached the South. What I don't know is how long did more developed countries have them.\n\nSo, think of a world where, everything else being equal, Brazil is an advanced country like the US and Europe and, thus, had access to such technologies as early as they had. How much earlier can the Cerrado be transformed into the valuable and productive agricultural land it is today?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678489164.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Churchill viewed the period from 1914-1945 as a second Thirty Years War where Germany attempted to secure itself as the hegemonic power in Europe. In both occasions it was challenged by an Anglo-French alliance and later required significant American intervention. Churchill certainly would have viewed this single conflict as the product of Prussian militarism (he goes into more detail on this in his history the First World War, The World Crisis, and the Gathering Storm, the first volume of his Second World War history\/memoirs). To be clear Churchill is not the only one to have framed the period this way but his interpretation has had significant influence on subsequent historiography. And this really is a question that gets at the heart of scholarship on the two world wars. \n\nAs to if there is any truth to it or if this is a possible summary of the period, is a highly contentious question amongst historians. While there are few today who will write about the World Wars as the same conflict (even Churchill wrote two separate series on them) there are some. In 2014 the History Channel in the United States did a miniseries called \u201cThe World Wars\u201d which explored this period as a thirty years war and followed some of the major historical actors from their experiences in the First World War into the Second which was framed as the larger culmination of the events from 1914-1918. So it still has its use to be viewed as one conflict. \n\nAs to if this is truth, it depends on your interpretation of Germany\u2019s role in the opening of WW1 and if WW2 should be seen as a separate historical event. These are not agreed upon in the historical scholarship. Max Hastings and Margaret Macmillan are two who argue Germany is primarily to blame for WW1 (but acknowledged that it was not the sole factor just the most important). Others such as Sean McMeekin have placed the blame far more on Russia and to a lesser extent France. Or Christopher Clark who argues that Serbia is more to blame than is often appreciated and that Germany was really just reacting to the confused flow of events. \n\nWhen it comes to the Second World War there are also some key scholarly differences on viewing that conflict as unique. Gerhard Weinberg argued in \u201cA World at Arms\u201d that it cannot be viewed as a single thirty years war as Hitler sought very different things from the Kaiser and prosecuted the war in a very different fashion. It is the Hitler centric nature of his argument that makes it incompatible with the Churchillian interpretation. Richard Overy, John Keegan, and Martin Gilbert all share similar assessments to Weinberg. \n\nHowever there has been a growing scholarship that also seeks to move away from the Eurocentric interpretation of the Second World War which is a serious challenge to the Churchillian view. This expands to include the war in China starting in 1931 or at least by 1937 as the true start to ww2. Overy does this in his most recent book. Or other revisionists like Sean McMeekin in his recent look at a Stalin centric rather than Hitler centric ww2. These changes to historical perspective make the notion that it was merely a Prussian prompted conflict difficult to accept. I think there is still some merit in viewing them as one event because of the connections the two conflicts have and whether the 1919 Treaty of Versailles is really to blame for WW2 it certainly was utilized by some of that wars biggest players to justify campaigns in the 1940s. So there is a strong link between the two but as to whether the OPs statement is accurate is likely to remain a matter of deep scholarly debate for decades to come.\n\nSources:\n\nWinston Churchill, \u201cThe World Crisis\u201d and \u201cThe Second World War\u201d both are available in abridged single volumes but the best are his multivolume editions for both works. \n\nMax Hastings: Catastrophe 1914\n\nChristopher Clark: The Sleepwalkers\n\nMargaret Macmillan: \u201cParis 1919\u201d and  \u201cThe War that Ended Peace\u201d the later being an examination of the origins of the First World War. \n\nRichard Overy: Blood and Ruins\n\nSean McMeekin: \u201cStalin\u2019s War\u201d, \u201cThe Russian Origins of the First World War\u201d, \u201cJuly 1914\u201d \n\nJohn Keegan: \u201cThe First World War\u201d and \u201cThe Second World War\u201d \n\nGerhard Weinberg: A World at Arms","upvotes":746,"created_utc":1678372263.0},{"author":"Sealswillflyagain","text":"As previous commentators mentioned, this is a very Churchillian idea of World Wars. Indeed, there is some truth to it: WWII was a direct result of WWI and most of the events leading up to the outbreak of WWII, from the Russian Revolution to the rise of Hitler, can be traced back to the Great War. The interwar Europe was remade into a patchwork of nation states that were meant to be overseen by the League of Nations. However, following the withdrawal of the United States and economic challenges, the new world order became unenforceable. To see a peace that was tightly imposed on the European continent one has to go back just a century to the Congress of Vienna and the Holy Alliance that safeguarded the status quo for the first half of the 19th century. \n\nNow, the Prussia part. Prussia was commonly blamed on all misfortunes that happened to Europe following the founding of the German Empire in 1871. It is true that the internal structure of the German Empire (and the Weimar republic after it) made Prussia disproportionately influential by design. I touched on that in [a previous response of mine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/10qtduc\/comment\/j6tsv8h\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The position of Prussia within Germany indeed made it more prone to be a Prussia-centred dictatorship. However, the Prussian aggression was not the cause of WWI. Indeed, out of all major European power, Germany was undoubtedly the *least interested* in a global war. Russia, Britain, France, Austria, and the United States all had substantially more to gain from a European war than Germany did.\n\nI think this has to be expanded a bit. There are, essentially, two textbook rationales commonly provided to justify what Germany wanted from the war. One is some mixture of Lebesnraum ideals and Pan-German nationalism. The other is the supposed quest for world domination. However, when you look at it closely, those claims do not hold water. Sure, there were some thinkers, very prominent once at times, who espoused world domination notions in Germany. But pre-1914 Germany was doing *great*. It was the second largest economy in the world, after the USA, and its industrial potential was also second only to America. German language was commonly taught in schools around the world and was the lingua franca of Central Europe. It was the language of modern science as German academia was the premier learning space in the world (American graduate schools were largely designed to mimic the best German practices of the day). This all indicates that the safest bet for Germany in its quest for a global status was to *do nothing and wait*. German industry and research were clearly superior to those of Britain and it was just a matter of time for Germany to becomes the second most powerful nation globally. \n\nNow, the territory part. Maps often cited to support such arguments, like [this one](https:\/\/digital.library.cornell.edu\/catalog\/ss:3293934), are almost exclusively based on no concrete evidence. They are mostly propaganda weapons meant to demonize Germany. Here are some facts. Germany already have colonies in Africa and Asia, mostly to project its image. Only one of then, German South West Africa (modern Namibia), had a substantial civilian German population, largely to facilitate diamond extraction in the region (the genocide that occurred there was also a manifestation of German interest). Germany, indeed Prussia directly, controlled about a half of modern Poland and successive German governments failed to Germanize them completely. In fact, it was in German-controlled lands where Poles and Lithuanians found refuge from the Russian assimilation policies. Land further east, next to the Baltic sea, were even less German. Expansion west also made little sense. In 1871 Germany got everything it ever wanted from France. Pan-Germanism has an even weaker case. In 1866, following the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, Prussia had a chance to fully merge with Austria. However, this idea was outright *rejected* by Bismark as deluding the Protestant majority with Austrian Catholics was a clear threat to the unified Germany. Indeed, the German Empire spent most of its relatively short history fighting southern Catholics. Adding more German Catholics into the Empire, and Germans in the east were overwhelmingly Catholic, would be a *massive blow* to Prussia. \n\nGermany entered the war that Austria started. Leaving Austria to fight Serbia, that had a defence alliance with Russia, alone would have lead to the eventual destruction of Austro-Hungary, leaving Germany surrounded by enemies. If revanchism, nationalism, and expansionism of Prussia-centred Nazi Germany would eventually lead it to the outbreak of WWII, reasons for the German Empire to join WWI were much less ambitions.","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1678399420.0},{"author":"LALA-STL","text":"Thanks for sharing your thorough, even-handed insights, u\/Gen_monty-28.

Thanks for the links to answers, btw, they were very interesting. \n\nThe answers, though, got me thinking. One of the answers referenced how WW1 was the first time where a war between (mostly) European powers had resulted in large scale fighting outside Europe. Of course there were conflicts outside Europe in the 7 years war and Napoleonic wars, but these were not anywhere near the scale of fighting in Europe. \n\nI do not doubt that the scale of fighting outside Europe in WW1 was immense, but I was wondering how important was it? For example, what impact did the fighting in colonial Africa have on the outcome of the war? Was there ever any chance of those conflicts being decisive in the War? What was the reason for the colonial powers to feel they needed to conduct large scale campaigns away from Europe? It\u2019s an area of the War I think is often overlooked. I certainly know next to nothing about it. Being schooled in the UK, we learn a lot about WW1, but almost exclusively that focuses on the Western Front, with maybe a brief mention of Gallipoli, Lawrence of Arabia, and perhaps a small mention of the Russian Revolution. \n\n(I also want to quickly say, I don\u2019t know if this is a historically accurate view, but in my mind the naval conflicts in the Atlantic, such as the u-boat campaigns, while not actually taking place in Europe, were extensions of the European conflict. The aim was to starve opponents in to submission.)","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678448590.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

The most important question is simply: \"Is food available?\"\n\nFor example, Japanese combat effectiveness was seriously reduced by lack of food in the latter parts of the battles of Guadalcanal, the Kokoda Track, Buna-Gona, Imphal-Kohima, the British reconquest of Burma, and also other battles. Generally, the lack of food resulted from the collapse of Japanese logistics, and was often accompanied by a lack of medical supplies and often a shortage of ammunition, which also reduced Japanese combat effectiveness. My examples here are all Japanese, since Japanese logistics were very poor in WWII, and the death rate of Japanese soldiers due to starvation and starvation-related disease was very high (out of approximately 2.3 million Japanese military dead, 1.4 million (about 60%) died of starvation or starvation related disease; the starvation death rate in the Pacific was higher than in China, since American naval supremacy cut Japanese supply to island garrisons other than small amounts of supplies delivered by submarines, but there were still many Japanese starvation deaths in China).\n\nFor sieges, the supply of food often determines the outcome. In modern firepower-heavy battles, ammunition can easily run out before food, but food can still be the main decisive factor. In pre-modern sieges, where weapons such as spears and swords didn't run out of ammunition, food supply was very often the critical factor. Food supply could also be important in open field battles in pre-modern times - an army might choose to attack under disadvantageous conditions because they were short of food.\n\nFood supply could be a decisive factor even if food supplies were still available to both sides. Tactics such as flooding (e.g., flooding a besieged city, or flooding a region that an enemy army was marching through, could deprive soldiers (and urban residents) of the opportunity to cook, even if food was present. In addition, flooding could destroy food supplies. (It would also deprive armies and cities of clean water - floodwaters are often a very high disease risk, with water mixed with sewerage mixed with garbage mixed with dead bodies of people and animals, and the flood could deprive armies of firewood for boiling contaminated water.) For example, the opening invasion of Mongol China by the Southern Song immediately after they together had defeated the remnants of the Jin was stopped when the Mongols deliberately flooded the area, leaving the Song army attempting to advance through chest-deep water.\n\nProvided that food was sufficiently plentiful, sufficiently nutritious, and could be cooked if necessary, the actual gustatory quality of the food was a far lesser issue. The British (together with other Allies) defeated German-Italian forces in North Africa in WWII despite appalling rations of hardtack and canned beef leftover from WWI (which, in storage in the desert, had the unpleasant tendency to separate in the can into a proteinaceous sludge at the bottom and a block of fat at the top). In the earlier part of the war in the North African theatre, when the Italian forces were well-supplied, the luxurious dining of the Italian officers didn't translate into effective military leadership. Paying a lot of attention to classy cooking during wartime is often a poor idea (and even more so when it is only available to the elite of the army).","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678519847.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678550991.0}]},{"title":"Do we know anything about attitude of continental Saxons\/Angles towards those of them who had moved to British island?","author":"Prestigious-Sand-651","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11o0dp3\/do_we_know_anything_about_attitude_of_continental\/","text":"I'm graduating this year and have to write my bachelor's dissertation on Anglo-Saxon history.

This will require us to examine the very complex relations between China, Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and Cambodia in order to understand why the decision was made in December 1978 and how historians have argued over the causes since.\n\n**The People's Republic of China and Vietnam in two wars, 1955-1973**\n\nOn January 18, 1950, the People's Republic of China became the first country in the world to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as an independent country. At this time, Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh United Front were still in a war of independence against France that had been active since 1946. After the recognition, China began to actively support the Viet Minh with supplies, equipment, weapons, and perhaps most importantly: trained personnel. There are several reasons why Mao Zedong chose to support the Viet Minh struggle, reasons which can be summarized as the need to secure the Chinese border from future imperialist threats and an attempt to project a new (post-1949) Chinese self-image as the supporter of independence and revolutionary movements. According to Qiang Zhai, this should also be seen in the context of China's traditional and historical relations with Vietnam, something the senior leadership of the People's Republic would have been well aware of, as well as the Sinocentric mindset that gripped the leadership.\n\nWhen North Vietnam, several years after France left Indochina, chose to take up armed struggle to reunite North and South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese government once again turned to China for help. The motives behind Mao Zedong's choice to once again involve China in Vietnam follow the same reasons as before and add two more reasons: Mao Zedong's necessity in the context of splitting with the Soviet Union to appear as the true supporter of North Vietnam and revolutionary movements, and the need to reform the Chinese state and society to ensure that \"revisionist\" tendencies were removed to prevent China from following the same path as the Soviet Union did after Stalin's death.\n\nDespite this, solidarity between China and North Vietnam began to weaken shortly after the first Chinese troops were stationed in North Vietnam. The Soviet Union's increased support for North Vietnam caused the North Vietnamese government to stop siding with China in their fight against Soviet \"revisionism\". The rapprochement between North Vietnam and the Soviet Union widened the gaps that were now beginning to show. This growing discontent reached its climax when North Vietnam showed its interest in beginning peace negotiations with the United States. From 1969 until 1973, Chinese support for North Vietnam decreased and Chinese troops left the country.\n\n**The period after the Vietnam War, 1974\u20131978**\n\nChina now began to see the Soviet Union as a greater potential threat than the United States, which had left South Vietnam in 1973. There is a debate among historians and academics from other fields as to what role the Soviet Union came to play in the final break between China and the now-reunified Vietnam. Some historians have chosen to minimize it while others have brought it into focus. Nicholas Khoo has put forward the thesis that, based on the principal enemy theory as an explanatory model, that the Soviet Union was the main reason that led to the Chinese break with Vietnam which in turn resulted in the invasion of Vietnam in 1979. The argument is that the tensions in China and Vietnam's relationship must be seen in a larger context where the conflict between the Soviet Union and China is at the center. As previously mentioned, ideological differences had led to tensions between the Soviet Union and China. Under Khrushchev, the Soviet Union took a more peaceful approach to revolutionary conflicts around the world under the slogan \"peaceful coexistence\". This conflicted with China's approach which encouraged armed struggle. The rift between the Soviet Union and China that occurred in the early 60s escalated during the Vietnam War and as we have seen, the countries both tried to influence North Vietnam. It was only after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the subsequent Soviet justification of interventions in socialist states that China began to see the Soviet Union as its main strategic and ideological enemy. This event reached its climax in the border conflict that broke out between the Soviet Union and China in 1969. The threat that the Soviet Union posed to China after 1975 and the military and economic support that the Soviet Union gave to Vietnam, which culminated in the creation of an alliance between the Soviet Union and Vietnam in November 1978 , can thus be seen as an important cause that led to the war.\n\nThe tensions between Vietnam and China affected the Chinese minority group living in Vietnam. In 1976, Vietnam began to force the Chinese minority in the country to take Vietnamese citizenship. Although North Vietnam had encouraged the minority group to take citizenship since the end of the 50s, it had mainly been through persuasion and education. Now the Vietnamese government threatened to take away opportunities for government jobs, food rations and fishing rights for those who did not choose to take Vietnamese citizenship. This was not something unique, argues Xiaorong Han, but something that many other countries in Southeast Asia with a Chinese minority had already done in the 50s and 60s. However, North Vietnam (and then Vietnam) had not chosen to go all the way to avoid creating problems with China. This was no longer the case in 1976 and the Vietnamese government viewed the Chinese minority with suspicion in the context of the approaching conflict between China and Vietnam. \n\nIn 1977, the Chinese minority living along the Vietnamese border with China were forced to choose between moving to designated economic zones in Vietnam or moving to China. The majority made the choice to flee to China and already a year later in July 1978 the number who had fled to China was already over 160,000. Vietnam's treatment of the Chinese minority aroused strong feelings in China and increased the contradictions between the countries. Chinese leaders felt that Vietnam was ungrateful for the help that China and the Chinese minority in Vietnam had given them during the Vietnam War. Vietnam's treatment of the Chinese minority later became one of the reasons China officially stated for invading Vietnam in 1979.\n\nOn September 4, 1958, China declared ownership of the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Due to the necessity of continued support from China, the North Vietnamese government recognized China's ownership of the islands in 1958 and 1965, something they privately resented as they felt they were being taken advantage of while they were in a weak and needy position. In January 1974, China took control of several of the Paracel Islands from South Vietnamese troops in a successful military operation. North Vietnam protested and occupied the Spratly Islands a couple of months later to prevent China from taking them over. This border dispute was complicated by the fact that Vietnam wanted to drill for oil in the Gulf of Tonkin, something China firmly denied them. Vietnam, on the other hand, chose to allow the Soviet Union to set up a military base in the Spratly Islands, which angered China. At the same time as the border dispute at sea between China and Vietnam began, a border dispute about the land border between China and Vietnam also began. As early as 1974 (According to Lien-Hang T. Nguyen this happens in 1973) there were minor border skirmishes that escalated year by year until the invasion in 1979. On both sides there were local authorities taking the opportunity to take territory from the border of the other country. Despite attempts at border negotiations, it came to naught due to the escalating deterioration of relations between China and Vietnam. Further reason for the failure of the negotiations was the hostile rhetoric directed at each other by both countries, which aggravated the local situation on the border, and Vietnam's treatment of the Chinese minority on its border. The border conflict with China and the approaching conflict with Kampuchea were, in the Vietnamese government's perspective, a threat to Vietnam's existence as an independent country.\n\nLike China, Cambodia had a checkered history with Vietnam. As early as 1971, there had been fighting between the Khmer Rouge, who would take power in Cambodia in 1975 and rename the country the Democratic Republic of Kampuchea, and North Vietnam. This conflict escalated after 1977 with attacks along the border between the two countries, culminating in Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea in 1978. To China, Kampuchea under Pol Pot was everything that reunified Vietnam was not after 1975. Kampuchea's desire to wage a genuine Maoist revolution stood in stark contrast to the supposedly revisionist Vietnam. Although China and Vietnam had previously cooperated in helping to support revolutions in Laos and Cambodia, the impending rift between China and Vietnam in the late 1960s was a turning point. China did not want to see an Indochina dominated by a Vietnam supported by the Soviet Union and thus tried to create counterweights in Cambodia and Laos. China failed in Laos where the Pathet Lao had a close relationship with North Vietnam but succeeded all the better in Cambodia where first Prince Sihanouk (before he was deposed by General Lon Nol) and then the Khmer Rouge would act, from China's perspective, as a buffer against Vietnam . Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea was thus an attack on a close ally, threatened Thailand, and consequently, from China's perspective, was a spread of the Soviet influence that already existed in Vietnam and Laos.","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678440579.0}]},{"title":"Willy Loman's drive to Portland, Maine - what was the landscape and drive like in 1949?","author":"Cognouveau","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11my5qg\/willy_lomans_drive_to_portland_maine_what_was_the\/","text":"I've been obsessively reading *Death of a Salesman* over the past few days.

This was adopted in Korea from the Chinese practice of doing the same thing. In Chinese, it was useful for writing the pronunciation of foreign words, and it was very useful in Korean for writing Korean grammatical particles when using Chinese characters (hanja) for writing Korean language. A few related systems for writing Korean with Chinese characters (usually with a mix of hanja used logographically and hanja used phonetically).\n\nThis phonetic use of hanja was followed by the use of a small set of simplified characters, derived from the hanja used phonetically, as phonetic characters. This script was called gugyeol. It was almost certainly derived from, or at least inspired by, similar Chinese use of simplified characters. It has sometimes been proposed that gugyeol instead derives from Japanese katakana, but this seems unlikely since it appears to predate katakana by a few centuries, and is complex in ways that look unlikely to have developed from simpler katakana (e.g., there are multiple redundant characters for some syllables).\n\nAlso very early was the use of siddham script for Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures. With Classical Chinese being used as the principal written language in China, Korea, and Japan, the simplest approach to record the pronunciation of Sanskrit scriptures was to keep them written in the original siddham script. In both Korea and Japan, siddham is still used today for Buddhist scriptures (in Japan, the script is also called bonji). Siddham is an abugida, i.e., a script where the primary part of each symbol is the initial consonant of a syllable, with the vowel indicated by secondary markings (or sometimes omitted, if not needed to avoid ambiguity), as other Brahmic scripts usually are.\n\nLater, during the period of Mongol rule (largely the same period as that of Mongol rule over China), Korea was exposed to the two main writing systems used for Mongolian language. These were traditional Mongolian script, derived from Uyghur script (this Mongolian script was later modified for the Manchu language) and \u02bcPhags-pa script. \u02bcPhags-pa was developed specifically for Mongol use as a \"universal\" script that was meant to be usable for writing any of the languages in use within the Mongol Empire. In addition, it was meant to better suit Mongolian language than the Uyghur-derived Mongolian script (traditional Mongolian script was itself modified to better suit western Mongolian dialects in the mid-17th century, resulting in todo besheg (\"clear script\"), or todo.) \u02bcPhags-pa never reached the same popularity for writing Mongolian as traditional Mongolian script and todo, but it was in official use when Korea was under Mongol rule, and it would have seen some use in Korea.\n\nNotably, \u02bcPhags-pa and hangul share an unusual feature: both are alphabets that are arranged in syllable blocks. As a result of this, and also the \"square\" appearance of \u02bcPhags-pa, \u02bcPhags-pa has been thought by some to be the basis of hangul. However, there is no clear parallel between the letters in the two scripts, so it doesn't appear that hangul is simply modified \u02bcPhags-pa. The alphabet-arranged-as-syllables nature of hangul might well come from \u02bcPhags-pa, but the hangul letters look like an independent development.\n\nIn addition, both Japanese phonetic syllabaries, katakana and hiragana, had been in use for centuries, and it is possible that they were known in Korea. Both had developed along the same lines as Korean gugyeol, so don't particularly add any new ideas to the mix of scripts already known in Korea.\n\n**In summary and conclusion,** it is likely that the use of an alphabet arranged as syllables design of hangul was adopted from the Mongolian \u02bcPhags-pa. It is possible, but not apparent, that the hangul letters might have been derived from \u02bcPhags-pa letters. More probably, they were independently designed. The usual use of hangul for until about 1600 was for writing elements such as Korean grammatical particles in mixed-script writing, with hanja used logographically for most words. This mixed hanja-hangul writing replaced earlier mixed logographic-phonetic systems which had used hanja phonetically for grammatical particles, or gugyeol characters for grammatical particles. In about 1600, a substantial body of all-hangul Korean literature appeared, often for women (including upper-class women who were often not literate in Classical Chinese) and the middle and lower classes (also not literate in Classical Chinese), while educated men continued to write in either Classical Chinese or in Korean using a mixed hanja-hangul system.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678515700.0}]},{"title":"When, why, and how did humans start using pillows?

When archaeologists find evidence of an early cultural practice, it is likely that the cultural practice is more widespread than the archaeological record indicates, and it is also likely that the cultural practice existed at a time that predates the archaeological site.\n\nThen ... can we trust the explanations for these artifacts and do they refer to \"more recent mythology e.g. Zeus posing as a bull and swan\"?\n\nWe can't really rely on these explanations because we simply don't know what is behind these images. People debate what is behind the Mona Lisa even though Da Vinci left records and there were contemporaries who wrote about him. We know a great deal about the man and his times, and yet the meaning\/significance of the Mona Lisa remains a matter of debate. We can't agree on who she is, what the artist intended, whether she smiling a great deal, just a little or what her enigmatic expression means. \n\nProjecting meaning onto incredibly old carvings - which aren't even particularly clear and for which there is no written record - is bound to the realm of speculation. We can imagine a great deal, but there is little that we can know.\n\nThat said, many (but not all) cultures include traditions about animal-human interactions. Many people believed\/believe that people can transform into animals, animals can transform into human-like entities, and that spirits can move between animal and human form in various situations. In these manifestations, sexual interaction is often described.\n\nIs that what is going on with some of these images? Perhaps. It is easy to imagine that the people who carved and viewed these images had traditions that involved these motifs, so perhaps that is what is being depicted. \n\nWe cannot know for certain that this is the case, but if it is the case, then I can say with confidence that it was a much older tradition, a cultural legacy from a former time. Traditions can be fluid, changing over time, and it is possible for aspects of culture to be imported or to come into being and be quickly viewed as traditional. On the other hand, traditions, particularly in pre-modern times, were often long lasting and had deep roots.","upvotes":68,"created_utc":1678390042.0}]},{"title":"Why did other European powers consider themselves true \"Romans\"?

While not officially translated in English, this manga series became decently famous in Japan (got some prizes), and adapted also as TV series. Several (not a single) medical historians and historians in Japan had involved this series as historical advisers both in the original manga and in the adapted TV series.\n\nThe protagonist of this story is a genius surgeon who sent back from 2000 CE to 1860s CE in Japan, less than ten years before Meiji Restoration in 1868. He tried to reproduce penicillin, but the major difficulties of reproducing penicillin in the 19th century were not just the cultivation of the mold Penicillium itself, but also the refinement (extraction) method as well as how to reproduce the reliable syringe, in addition to the enormous fund and social fame to let the time-traveled stranger to build the production factory.  \n\nThese are some examples of such difficulties to reproduce penicillin about 70 years earlier than real history and how they tried to solve them: \n\n* The protagonist succeeded in borrowing the faculty of Japanese rice-wine brewery. By this, he could not only make use of the cultivation (temperature control) method and environment of *Aspergillus* (the mold used for the fermentation of Japanese rice wine), \n* Filtration by charcoal: Brewery of Japanese rice wine used charcoal roughly since the 17th century, so he could also had access to this filtration material important for the extraction. \n* Paper Chromatography: Paper (a substitute of filter paper) was available in Edo Period Japan, and the protagonist made use of them to extract penicillin further (prior to that, charcoal filtration with help of plant oil and acid was mainly used- see [the drama's column (unfortunately in Japanese only)  linked here](https:\/\/www.tbs.co.jp\/jin2009\/report\/report_12.html)). Paper Chromatography (invented by the Russian scientist around 1900) itself is also a kind of anachronistic technology.  \n\nIn addition to these problems, the historical background of this work also tries to make sense in the following issues: \n\n* Late Edo Period as a transition period from the traditional medicine\/ science to western medicine\/ science: The new medicine might be regarded as a challenge to the paradigm of medicine\/ science of the period, but 19th century (or since the last decade of the 18th century) Japan actually saw the relatively gradual paradigm shift of science (including medical one), in form of increasing filtration of Western science (\"Dutch science\") in field of medicine and anatomy, even without the protagonist's intervention. An pioneering (smallpox) vaccination hospital founded in Edo (Tokyo) 1859 epitomized this changing trend, and the manga\/ TV series take some model of funding\/ social reception as well as the adaptation of new technology among contemporary Japanese. Acknowledged also by one of the authorities in medical science, the protagonist could fortunately be counted not as an unknown imposter, but as the pioneer of this new trend (actually that around 2000, though......) from the relative beginning of the story.  \n* Latex\/ natural rubber (for syringe) and some glassware were also available from the Dutch trading post (their presence was probably testified in the material for the vaccination hospital). This kind of latex should probably also be treated with sulphur, however, and the modern \"vulcanizaion\" process of natural rubber had not known until 1830s. \n* Some wealthy merchants in Edo are also known to have invested the vaccination hospital before, and they also appear in fund-rising process in the story.  \n\nThus, the historical background of *JIN* (sent back to 1860s Japan) is at least taken these conditions (that should be met) into consideration. I don't think all of these conditions (especially latex treated with sulphur and filter paper's substitute) were easily met in pre-modern period.  \n\n(Adds): While not officially translated and published in English, the manga is translated and available in the manga author's patreon site (the first two chapters are free).","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678507335.0}]},{"title":"Is the stress of being \u201con time\u201d a modern concept?","author":"natcat901","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11m0fft\/is_the_stress_of_being_on_time_a_modern_concept\/","text":"You can be fired from your job for being 10 minutes late and lose your entire livelihood.

Thompson, [\u201cTime, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism\u201d](https:\/\/www.sv.uio.no\/sai\/english\/research\/projects\/anthropos-and-the-material\/Intranet\/economic-practices\/reading-group\/texts\/thompson-time-work-discipline-and-industrial-capitalism.pdf) that provides a lengthy answer to your question. I\u2019ve provided a link to the essay, but in a nutshell: yes, the pressing need to be \u201con time\u201d is indeed a modern concept. \n\nThompson makes a distinction between \u201ctime orientation\u201d and \u201ctask orientation\u201d with respect to the history of work. Traditional, pre-capitalist societies tend to organize time around the performance of tasks; the day is defined by the things that need to be done (sowing, harvesting, grazing, churning butter, etc.) rather than any abstract notion of time. This leads to an informal, often leisurely attitude toward punctuality. Thompson quotes the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s observation with respect to Algerian Kabyle peasants: \n\n> An attitude of submission and of nonchalant indifference to the passage of time which no one dreams of mastering, using up, or saving\u2026 Haste is seen as a lack of decorum combined with diabolical ambition.\n\nThe rise of wage labour and modern industrial work, however, revolutionized the experience of time. Work was no longer a collective endeavor performed in a communal setting; it was a commodity\u2014a factor of production\u2014bought and sold at market rates. And like other things bought and sold on the market, it needed to be standardized and quantified. This was especially true in a factory setting, where by the 19th century wage rates were increasingly set by hours worked rather than pieces produced.\n\nWatches and clocks, which had previously been luxury items, were transformed into conveniences, then necessities. Thompson makes the case that this was not merely an innocent change, but was the function of increasing labour discipline on the part of employers. While work in pre-modern communities followed a pattern of intense activity followed by slack times, dictated by the pace of the tasks that needed to be performed, employers in an industrial setting had a vested interest in maximizing the productivity of their workers, and the clock became a tool for measuring their efficiency. (By the 20th century, this approach was epitomized by the \u201cscientific management\u201d techniques of Frederick Winslow Taylor, who engaged in \u201ctime-motion\u201d studies to find the most efficient means of completing tasks in the workplace.)\n\nAs Thompson puts it,\n\n> Enclosure [the process by which communal land was turned into private holdings] and the growing labour-surplus at the end of the eighteenth century tightened the screw for those who were in regular employment; they were faced with the alternatives of partial employment and the poor law, or submission to a more exacting labour discipline. It is a question, not of new techniques, but of a greater sense of time-thrift among the improving capitalist employers (pg. 78).\n\nBy the 20th century, this \u201ctime-orientation\u201d toward work became more widespread and internalized by workers, to the point where it became significant well beyond the workplace. (The whole notion of \u201cthe weekend\u201d is a 20th-century invention, for example.) \n\nSee also Michael O\u2019Malley, *Keeping Watch: A History of American Time* (1996) for the American side to this story, particularly the revolution in the experience of time that took place in the 19th and early 20th centuries.","upvotes":2003,"created_utc":1678315538.0},{"author":"phistomefel_smeik","text":"**Preamble**\n\nI'm actually in the middle of writing a masters thesis about abstract time. While E.P. Thompsons essay mentioned in the other comment is great, there is more to say about punctuality and being on time. In fact I'd say it is thanks to Thompson that time studies as a field really got popular with historians, but there is also controversy about its validity. I think Thompson still holds up, but it has to be taken with a grain of salt, as it was only meant to be sort of an exploration, not an final study.\n\nMy answer will be focused on the german part of Switzerland, as those are the sources I'm most familiar with. More can always be said - if you're interested in the history of abstract time, I'll provide some books in the end.\n\nThe answer to your question is a boring 'yes, but'. It really depends on who we're talking about. Generally, being on time is and was important when people had to work together. The more people had to be coordinated, the more important being on time became. I'll give you two examples, in which being on time developed different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Governing and judging**\n\nMedieval cities were ruled by a multitude of different actors which had overlapping competences. Lucerne, a canton and member of the Eidgenossenschaft since 1332, the city and canton were ruled by the R\u00e4te \\[councils\\]. There was the small council who, alongside of the council of the 100, incorporated judicial, legislative and executive powers. In 1470 they introduced the 'Neunergericht' \\[a small court consisting of nine people, hence the name\\], that should relieve the R\u00e4te by judging over smaller issues, but even here we don't have a clear distinction on who exactly does what.\n\nAs you can probably guess, coordinating those governing bodies wasn't easy. There were, of course, power struggles, but also one basic problem: How can you rule a city with so many people involved in the government? You had the R\u00e4te, who consisted of 18 and 100 people respectively. But there were also clerks, record keepers and - last but not least - the people you judged over. How do you get all those people to show up together?\n\nThe answer seems simple: Bells.Before the bigger cities had their first clocks - which happened around 1350-1380 for the biggest cities in europe \\[1385 for Lucerne\\] - people were being coordinated with bells. One prominant example are church bells, which had to be rung a bit in advance, so when the people heard the bells, they could start making out for the church and be there in time for the sermon.\n\nOne of the oldest surviving accounts of an attempt in coordinating the R\u00e4te was written down between 1315 and 1321:\n\n>wele dez rates ist, der sol am fritage z\u016f dem rate komen. Und ist er n\u00fat im huse, die wil man die gloggen l\u00fatet, der git iij s., ob er in der kilch\u00f6ri ist. Gat aber deheine in den Hof ze kilchun oder ze dien Barf\u016fszen oder ze der Kapelle, hat er dene ein iarzit da oder ist er bi einr lich da ald ist er an daz ze mesze da vor dem heiligen kruze, gat er denne v\u00farsich dannan zem rate ane geverde, so verschult er enkhein einung. \\[1\\]\n\nRoughly speaking it calls for members of the council to join the council on fridays. If they're not in the building when the bell rings, they have to pay a fee, altough this fee is dropped if you're too far away (and thus couldn't hear the bell). This is clearly a pressure for council members to be 'on time'.\n\nWith later constitutions, this rule gets more and more precise: In 1421, it was ruled that the council would henceforth meet three times a week and as a member you had to go to the council as soon as the bell rang. But now a new rule was introduced: You were not considered late, unless the council finished discussion the first two items of the day. If you joined after those first two items were discussed, you had to pay the fine. \\[2\\]\n\nWhile the council was still bound to concrete times \\[i.e. bells and the items discussed, which obviously would vary in length\\] and not an abstract clock time, the noose is very slowly tightening as rules around punctuality get stricter. Interestingly, it took until 1446 until the council decreed that an hour should be fixed for their meetings, and until 1485 until they dropped the ruling of the first two items and replaced it with a quarter hour (which they probably measured with an hourglass). \\[3&4\\] This was also roughly the timeframe, when they constricted the meeting in their duration.\n\nThis doesn't mean that that problem was fixed though. Throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries you can find countless Ratsordnungen, where the council members tried to tackle the problem of tardiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So is this a 'pre-modern' problem?**\n\nNow you see, being on time is something people struggled with even in late medieval\/early modern periods. In fact, there is a play\/poem attributed to Plautus, in which he supposedly responds to the first sundial being erected in ancient rome \\[5\\] (which was sacked in sicily and brought to rome in 263 BC):\n\n>The gods confound the man who first found outHow to distinguish hours! Confound him, too,Who in this place set up a sun-dialTo cut and hack my days so wretchedlyInto small portions! When I was a boy,My belly was my only sun-dial, one more sure,Truer, and more exact than any of them.This dial told me when 'twas proper timeTo go to dinner, when I had aught to eat;But nowadays, why even when I have,I can't fall to unless the sun gives leave.The town's so full of these confounded dialsThe greatest part of the inhabitants,Shrunk up with hunger, crawl along the streets.\n\n\\[6\\]\n\nBut bear in mind that I have only talked about a very privileged, small part of society - the elite of the city, so to speak, who were part of the government; usually rich, educated and able to read and write. I did not talk about the people summoned to court, which was ruled entirely differently (usually a clerk fetched those and if you didn't show up the first or second day(!), the other person won the case).\n\nIts way more difficult to try and reconstruct the pressure of being on time for a broader public, because - as stated above - many of them weren't able to write their own experiences down. We know some laws, but where they followed or where they merely an ideal, written down by the elites?\n\nWhen looking at laws written for the public, punctuality isn't as prevalent, at least not in 'abstract' terms. When dancing, drinking or gambling were repressed or forbidden, this was usually done with concrete reminders that everyone understood \\[i.e. its forbidden 'in the night' or 'after the firebell rings'\\]. There is not the same level of pressure for being on time as we've witnessed for the R\u00e4te. \\[7\\]\n\nWhen we look at the working population, the work days were organised loosely. From the mid 15th century on the 'tagwan' \\[the labor that was done in one day\\] was rung with a bell, so that the tagwaner knew when they had to start and finish work. But most workers lived under the roof of their master, so there wasn't such a big need for coordination. Also we don't know much about the lengths of lunch breaks and so on, because much of the life of a Geselle was organised under his masters roof. \\[8\\]","upvotes":299,"created_utc":1678363736.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1678305911.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-14,"created_utc":1678313196.0}]},{"title":"How long have people been drinking plant-based milks?","author":"DogmansDozen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11mss9g\/how_long_have_people_been_drinking_plantbased\/","text":"Follow up question would be, were those societies referring to their almond\/oat\/soy\/whatever concoctions as \u201cmilk\u201d in their languages?

Some garments would have used linen if it was available, but wool was your go-to. To turn raw wool into fabric, it has to be scoured, carded, and then spun into yarn, which can either be sold as-is, used for knitting, or woven into bolts of cloth. The spinning of yarn was traditionally women's work, and was essentially ubiquitous across much of Medieval England, and other areas of wool production. The spinning wheel arrived in Europe in the 13th century, and prior to this, spinners would have used a drop spindle when spinning wool into yarn.\n\nIn 2009, a competition at a Georgia (US) yarn festival found that: \"three fastest wheel spinners produced about 90 to 92 yards per 15 minutes while the three fastest spindle spinners spun between 38 to 56 yards in the same 15 minutes.\" These figures can be adjusted somewhat since most Medieval women would have been experienced full-time spinners. While the spinning wheel is demonstrably faster, the drop spindle remained extremely commonplace as it was highly portable, allowing spinning to be done almost constantly, whether doing other farm work, cooking, socialising, or relaxing. [Here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bKAJTKvl0nE) is a short video explaining how to use a drop spindle, and you'll see how an experienced spinner could easily do this while out and about, or waiting on other tasks.\n\nWeaving was a more specialised task, and was often the role of a singular craftsman or woman who collected the yarn from multiple spinners. In the Early Medieval period, weaving was done by hand on vertical looms, which were replaced by horizontal looms from the 11th Century, with these already becoming mechanised by the 12th Century using foot pumps to power the treddle. Weaving often became an urban (or pseudo-urban) industry, with workshops set up in market towns where women from surrounding villages could easily bring and sell their yarn. In 13th Century Ghent, there were over 2,300 weavers operating in the city's workshops (Stage, *Medieval Looms*). How long it would take to actually weave fabric is a very tricky question to answer, since it depends on the quality and thickness of the yarn, the desired density and thickness of the fabric, colour choices, and the skill and experience of the weaver. Typically, setting the loom was the most labour-intensive process once the mechanised looms of the 13th Century were in operation. *Very*, **very** broadly speaking, however, a weaver might produce a metre square of fabric in about 3 to 4 hours.\n\nSeamstresses were a recognised occupation; the 9th Century will of an Early Medieval English noblewoman called Wynfl\u00e6d leaves a slave 'who is a skilled seamstress and dressmaker' to her daughter, for example. In a smaller settlement, women likely produced their own clothing and that of their families, but it's also entirely possible that labour was bartered to a more skilled neighbour in return for other goods and services. In 14th Century London, \"the best wool\" was on sale for around 5 shillings per yard, but cheaper fabric was available for between 8 pence and 1 shilling and thruppence per yard, while the coarsest wool 'for landless serfs' cost as little as sixpence.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1678445580.0}]},{"title":"When and where were the earliest apple orchards in America?

They were brought to the western Hemisphere by Europeans. There are a number of native apples to North America and some were used by indigenous people, especially Malus Fusca or pacific crab. Which was dried or cooked down. I wouldn\u2019t say these were orchards and more like people utilizing natural resources, even if they were cultivated and care for. They are not the kind of thing we think of as modern orchards. \n\nLooking forward to European settlement. Apples were brought over fairly early and succeeded to great success. Apples and other fruit like Peaches were adopted by indigenous people. Places like the Finger Lakes and The Smokey Mountains and southern Appalachia had unique varieties that indigenous people cultivated. Some of these Cherokee apples varieties still exist, Junaluska and Nickajack to name two of them. \n\nThese early European settlers brought over whole apples and apples seeds to plant rather than trees. Apples do not grow true to type. Meaning the seedling  that will grow will be a a unique individual with a unique combination of genes that may or may not express traits of its parents. Today New DNA research is showing that a lot of the early American apples like Baldwin, Roxbury Russet and other apples share a common ancestor, Reinette Franche, which is a storage apple meaning it shipped well. It was a popular apple in England for shipping in the mid 17th century. \n\nApples that came to North America via a couple of routes. From England in Virginia and New England and via Sweden along the Delaware river valley. Also apples came to CA, New Mexico and the southwest via Spanish central and South America. \n\nSo apples like I said spread fast and could be found on all matter of properties tended by a wide range of people. Palatine Germans in NY or free poor white in Virginia apples on homesteads while large estates from NY to Virginia grew apples that were cared for by enslaved people. Slaves took care of a lot of the orchards. Jefferson is noted apple lover and cider maker and his orchard and cider were tended to by George Granger and his \n\nSo all of these orchards and apples are being grown basically by everyone. Rich, poor, enslaved and indigenous. They begin to develop a unique set of apple varieties. They have been an estimated 20,000 varieties of apples cultivated in the country since their arrival. Apples were great because they required fairly low labor inputs compared to other crops and could be sustained on soil or hills that were less ideal for field or row crops. \n\nBut the first modern orchard come about in the early 19th century. I say it is the first modern orchard because prior to this orchard were growing fruit mostly for self or local consumption either for fruit or for cider. River Livingston Pell established Pell Orchard is Esopus, ny in the mid Hudson valley just south of the city of Kingston. He had a 1,200 acres farm in 1838 and was growing apples (Newtown pippin) for export, mostly to Europe. His orchard set the norms and practices for large scale agriculture on a commodity scale. So while it is over 200 years after apples were introduced I think of as the first modern commercial orchard. \n\nIn terms of Johnny Appleseed he was a land speculator that grew a ton of seedling apples across the then frontier of the US, mostly Indiana, Ohio and Illinois. He grew apples from seed which cheapest but also the most inconsistent. It\u2019s said that he would often move on from an area when other nurseries some to town because they would sell better named variety trees rather than the seedling he offered. So while he no doubt had an impact of the genetics of Midwest apples it is hard to measure.  His mass cultural appeal because of an Atlantic article that came out many years after his death. \n\nIn my mind Appleseed fame takes away from the thousand of individual who worked to breed and develop the 20,000 varieties once found in the country. \n\nApples have so much history","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1678413605.0}]},{"title":"What's the history or origin of the idea that links the full moon with \"lunacy\"?","author":"Hegar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11n8bhe\/whats_the_history_or_origin_of_the_idea_that\/","text":"I recently read that as many as 80% of mental health professionals believe this, despite no evidence.

Taylor gives an answer for the second and third centuries BC and is the basis for this answer. It gives a comparative look at the monetary and manpower abilities of the five great Mediterranean powers during that time, Rome, Carthage, Macedonia (Antigonid dynasty), the Seleucids, and Ptolemies in Egypt. The short answer is that Rome was able to much more efficiently fund their military than the other powers which allowed them to be able to have many active theaters of war at once and mobilize the largest forces. This also allowed them to suffer massive losses and still continue fighting. They weren\u2019t able to do so infinitely, Rome had its limits as well, but they were able to do so better than their great power competitors which allowed Rome to establish itself as the Mediterranean hegemon. The maximum mobilizations for the five powers during that time were as follows:\n\nRome: 185,000\n\nCarthage: 165,000\n\nMacedonia: 50,000\n\nSeleucids: 80,000\n\nPtolemies: 80,000\n\nWhile Rome had a strategic manpower advantage they were often at a tactical manpower parity or disadvantage for many of their key battles during this period. You would think that the relative finances would match or be close to the same ranking of this strategic manpowers, however they are not. Taylor estimates that the annual revenue for each power was the following annotated is millions of Attic drachmas:\n\nRome: 12\n\nCarthage: 8 (Edit: This amount is for after the Second Punic War. It was probably closer to 16 million before the war. )\n\nMacedonia: 8\n\nSeleucids: 190\n\nPtolemies: 260s\n\nRome was able to pay for their military more efficiently. Taylor assesses that the pay for an average soldier in the Mediterranean was around a drachma. Rome was able to pay their soldiers less than 2 obols (there were 6 obols in a drachma), so less than a third of their competitors prices. Additionally, Roman armies contained a large portion, normally at least half or more, of troops from their Italian allies. These Allie\u2019s paid and equipped their troops while Rome provides their rations. This lowered costs even more. Taking into account purchasing power parity the difference is even more. The maximum possible mobilized manpower based off of purchasing power and maximum recognizes were:\n\nRome: 215,000\n\nCarthage: Not provided\n\nMacedonia: 35,000\n\nSeleucids: 140,000\n\nPtolemies: 160,000\n\nYou can see that Rome came close to the maximum manpower, Macedonia exceeded it (believed to be because they tapped into their cash reserves to fund it), while the Seleucids and Ptolemies were around half. Some of this was cultural. Rome was apparently very studious in their financial bookkeeping and austere when it came to non-military spending during that time.\n\nThe Seleucids and Ptolemies were the opposite and had huge non-military courtly costs such as feasts, processions, benefits to junior allies and so on. These two kingdoms needed to do this to ensure the loyalties of elites. They couldn\u2019t just shut it off during war because they needed the elites even more during war. Macedonia is a bit of an outlier here as it was a kingdom but didn\u2019t do this massive non-military spending. Part of that would be because they had the least people and money so they couldn\u2019t spend it like that. The other is that they were Macedonian kings ruling over the kingdom of the Macedonians. The Seleucids and Ptolemies were Macedonian kings ruling over land they had conquered and had no ethnic ties to.\n\nAnother reason given is the difference between states that sought to extract value from subject people either through conscription or taxation. Each power did both but the relative weight between the two was what was important. Rome was the best at conscription and in the end won. Carthage went from heavy taxation to conscription during the Second Punic War and was able to field large armies that almost defeated Rome. Macedonia was conscription and was able to punch above its weight. The Seleucids and Ptolemies were both taxation that had to rely and a relatively small cadre of military settlers as the core of their armies, but this is a method that is relatively fragile. They could use their mass wealth to purchase mercenaries and they did so. However, there were only so many mercenaries and the other side (these two kingdom\u2019s most common opponent was each other) was probably trying to do the same driving up prices and down supply. Some of the other powers could also be trying to purchase mercenaries for a different war at the same time or the mercenaries could be fighting a war for their home state. Often they had more money than available mercenaries.\n\nFinally, Rome was a republic then which allowed for its societal infrastructures were more robust, penetrating, and resilient than those of the kingdoms. Legitimacy was given to the Roman government through its repeated votes. Carthage was also a republic and it gave Rome its toughest test by far. However, compared to Rome it appears that its structures weren\u2019t as strong. Carthage probably had fewer citizens in Rome. Additionally, the ties to the subject manpower were generally either personal relationships with the Carthaginian elite (like weddings) or through harsher methods such as hostage taking. These methods are less resilient than the Roman methods.\n\nI should add that Taylor makes it clear time and again in his book that the absolute numbers listed above aren\u2019t important, but rather the relative strength between them. Additionally the 8 million Attic drachmas for Carthage is after the Second Punic War and it was probably closer to 16 million before the war.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678423882.0}]},{"title":"What was the ancient Greeks' attitude toward war PTSD?","author":"-Tram2983","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ncv7p\/what_was_the_ancient_greeks_attitude_toward_war\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678417648.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

This would not necessarily guarantee that her partner got the entire house, but could have given her a share at worst. This kind of arrangement started in the 1910s and would not have been limited to romantic partners. Whether that\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d to an elderly person in the 60s is up for debate.\n\nShe could have also set up a trust. Trusts in common law are very old, 15th century old, and have a long history of exceptions and complicated case law. While this would have been theoretically available to her, I can confidently say that this would have been nearly impossible for her to set up in 1960 without the help of a professional. These are complex legal devices that would have been hard to arrange pre-internet (they are still hard, but this would have been far worse).\n\nRealistically, the actions that could have taken *while she was alive* haven\u2019t changed much in the last century. What would have changed is the societal attitude toward these measures. She would have grown up in an era where a single woman probably wouldn\u2019t have had a will. She grew up in an era where even the wealthy rarely had trusts (as you might notice, she would have grown up in an era where \u201ctrust\u201d and thus \u201canti-trust\u201d were largely corporate words). If she was not wealthy enough to have regular contact with an attorney, the idea that she had to protect assets at all may have never occurred to her.\n\nThen, as now, estates are largely dependent on the deceased taking care of things while alive. How a partner can challenge an estate has changed a lot in the last century, but the instruments she could have used while alive would have changed little in the 50 or so years prior to the setting.","upvotes":19,"created_utc":1678388048.0}]},{"title":"There seemed to be an increased Native American presence in American pop culture during the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s.

As sea levels rose, and their island shank, they built a boat, landed in modern Iraq, and started doing their thing. Once they got going and settled in, the sea levels stopped rising, and -- since they learned how agriculture works and were now sitting straight between the Tigris and Euphrates, they were prime and ready to get a civilization going. \n\nTo be clear, I'm in no way suggesting that this is like some lost civilization of Atlantis or something. But an Easter island type of highly isolated civilization somewhere in the area that was peaceful, self sufficient, and maybe even learned how to farm (it's much easier to learn how to farm on an island for obvious reasons)? I could believe it... I mean, it sort of explains all the weird little idiosyncrasies of the Sumerian origins and why its culture is so different to the others around it.\n\nAnyways, I've been looking for a while, and I can't find anyone who has done any real research on the topic?

As you have rightly pointed out, a map assumes that the emperor has administrative control over all the areas covered, but this was not the case in Southeast Asia. \n\nIn Southeast Asian 'empires', the guy at the top (like a raja or a sultan) did not have administrative power over the entire empire. Rather, the raja or sultan at the top of the food chain had other rajas and sultans who pledged fealty to him, and these rajas and sultans in turn had chiefs who pledged fealty to them, and so on and so forth all the way down.\n\nHowever, pledging fealty did not mean obediently carrying out orders, and Southeast Asian history is rife with rajas who decided that they were powerful enough to simply ignore the guy above them.

You mention sailing to India, but the vast majority of sailors in the 17th century would not leave Europe, but rather worked on ships in the trade routes in Europe, and in navies doing wartime - salary was also higher in merchant navies. \n\nThis means that for the vast majority of the sailors, the trips were relatively short, often some weeks, maybe a couple of months at a time. And for many sailors, they would spend the Winters at home, since most long-distance sailing would be at a lower intensity during winters, perhaps doing coastal sailing trips. So for these kinds of sailors, they'd spend the Winters with their families, then doing as many longer trips as possible in the Summers. \n\nAs for the longer trips, it varies more. Trips to America in the 17th century usually weren't that long - taking about 6 weeks each wore, or 3-4 months in total. Doing one of those every summer then spending the Winter at home was doable. \n\nAsia was different however. In the best case scenario, a trip to Asia for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) would be at least 6 months away, so you'd be gone for a whole year. But on the whole, the VOC did not really send people on just one trip in that sense. Rather, they would sign primarily bachelors, and primarily on contracts for 5 years, so that you could also serve on company ships on trade routes in Asia.\n\nSo going to Asia in was not really a steady career path for someone with a family in Europe., It was a much bigger commitment. Many people would sign for these 5 years as a way to gain experience to get better employment after returning, or straight up for the sake of adventure. (It was risky, with much higher mortality and not really any higher salary). Some would end up marrying local women in Asia and settling down there, even after completing their service, since Asian women were not allowed to be brought back to Europe. Otherwise you'd use your experience and salary upon returning as a way to get a wife, and then start working on the European merchant vessels, where it was relatively safe, and the salary was high - but conversely, these were also harder to get into. Taking the risk and going to Asia for 5 years was therefore a way to get ahead and boost your career later. If you were a high-ranking officer you could bring your wife and children with you to Asia, but this was not an opportunity for common sailors. \n\nAs for how the wives survived in the months their husband was at sea. At least in the case of my epoch, often a portion of the sailor's salary was paid out to their wife and children (the sailor himself had food and housing covered while on the ship, and had little to actually use the money for except when visiting ports) so they sustained themselves. The families often lived in communities where the wives would support each other, as would older, retired sailors - for the most part a sailor would retire around 40 if they weren't an officer by then, as they were no longer capable of doing the often dangerous and physically demanding labor on the ships. \n\nSo I hope that answers your question, at least in one context. Generally, sailors did not go to Asia for years while leaving wives and children at home, they at most be gone for months at a time (different during war time obviously) For the vast majority, going to Asia was something you did once in your life for an adventure and experience to boost your career after returning, or to settle down in Asia permanently.","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1678386778.0}]},{"title":"Thursday Reading & Recommendations | March 09, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11msx6z\/thursday_reading_recommendations_march_09_2023\/","text":"[Previous weeks!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/search?q=Thursday+Reading+%26+Research&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nThursday Reading and Recommendations is intended as bookish free-for-all, for the discussion and recommendation of all books historical, or tangentially so.

In one (very real) sense, women\u2019s rights were imposed by an occupying power via a constitution drafted by foreigners (the only woman involved was American, as were all of the major contributors), but at the same time, those rights and much more (the new constitution not being all that progressive, in fact) had been sought for decades by a homegrown Japanese feminist movement. Going point by point through the four adjectives in your post title:\n\n1. The wartime regime was not traditionalist in any authentic sense; it was fascist, reaching back *past* the traditions of the Edo period and earlier shogunates to a mythic imperial past. Traditional Japanese society was overturned in 1868 with the Meiji Restoration, and its most militant partisans were subsequently wiped out in a series of rebellions. Patriarchy survived the change quite intact, of course, but it wasn\u2019t uncontested, and there was a lot of social tumult in general.\n\n2. It would be slightly oversimplifying to just dismiss \u201cconformist\u201d as a racist stereotype\u2026but only slightly. The idea of interwar Japan as a conformist society is absolutely wrong. The 1920s and 30s were characterized by protests, strikes, failed assassination attempts, successful assassinations, and coups one after the other. \n\n3. Japan had already been democratic\\* in the Taisho era (1912\u20131926), and it didn\u2019t return to democracy immediately after the war. The United States didn\u2019t even nominally restore Japanese sovereignty until 1952, and it operated Japan as a puppet state for many years after that. The Liberal Democratic Party (which has held almost uninterrupted power since 1955) was funded, advised, and in some cases directed by the CIA for almost two decades, if not longer.\n\n4. The immediate postwar years were characterized by military occupation, heavy-handed American influence, the restoration of war criminals and other fascist ne\u2019er-do-wells to positions of power and influence, and intense anticommunism. Compared to the Taisho era, it was not a period distinguished by free thought or radical feminist activism.\n\nIan Buruma\u2019s *Inventing Japan: 1853\u20131964* is an excellent overview of the whole time (and the whole process of modernization and cultural reinvention) we\u2019re talking about, from the late Edo period through to independence after the American occupation. This [fantastic Barbara Molony article](https:\/\/oxfordre.com\/asianhistory\/display\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190277727.001.0001\/acrefore-9780190277727-e-194;jsessionid=B30B2EC2AE19CE33904A4A56A0EFE813?__prclt=5rDrr6A8#acrefore-9780190277727-e-194-div1-9) details the history of Japanese feminism in roughly the same time period (she goes a bit past 1964).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in postwar Japanese feminism exclusively, I recommend *Scream from the Shadows: The Women\u2019s Liberation Movement in Japan* by Setsu Shigematsu (which is largely concerned with the 1970s). Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say I have any good nonfiction book recs about prewar feminism or Japanese women\u2019s first encounters with modernity and the concomitant social change. Would love to get some, if anybody else can give a shout.\n\n\\* Easy to get way into the weeds on this, so I\u2019m sticking it down here as a footnote, but, in short, the Taisho era saw a struggle for greater enfranchisement that culminated with universal adult male suffrage in 1925 (before that, there had been tax-based restrictions). Was it totally democratic even then? Of course not\u2014women still couldn\u2019t vote, most obviously\u2014but the same is true of a lot of societies we think (and thought) of as democratic. French women didn\u2019t get the vote until after the war either (Swiss women didn\u2019t until the 1970s). The UK didn\u2019t have \u201cone person, one vote\u201d until 1948\u2014you used to get extra votes for owning property and having gone to university!","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1678389298.0}]},{"title":"How biblical figures were able to talk with people from other cultures ?","author":"ImadeapromiseMrfrod","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11n7xoy\/how_biblical_figures_were_able_to_talk_with\/","text":"In the book of exodus the Daniel was able to talk with the babylon king, the language of babylon was somehow similar to the one spoken in Israel during that time ?","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1678405273.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

We know that the Myceaneans spoke an Indo-European language and wrote in Linear B, while the Minoans (probably) didn't speak an Indo-European language.\n\nIn the proto-indo-european language, they had words specifically about quasi-Steppe culture of animal husbandry, honey, honeybees, and the like. They were also (allegedly) incredibly patriarchal, without words for women (instead, they were simply wives, which I assume, meant that women were some sort of class of property). The rationale that makes sense to me is that the language grew out of the goods, services, objects, and actions relevant to the community that spoke the language.\n\nI also learned about linguistic 'laws' - i.e. Grimm's Laws - and the movement of sounds and inflections over time. I also remember reading recently that we've catalogued hundreds of thousands of Ancient Greek names (not, I assume, from the Bronze Age) over time.\n\n**So here's my hypothesis**.\n\nThe Minoan language (and its greater family) was probably spoken around the Mediterranean, to some extent, for quite some time at the same time the indo-europeans were spreading out around the area as well. I assume that, because trade was so integral to the Mediterranean world, and there was a heavy economic incentive to speak the same language in order to trade, there were significant pressures to conform to some sort of Minoan-Mediterranean language prior to the introduction of Indo-European. By looking at the ways in which words were pronounced, shifted while in contact with other geographic areas (like, say, if a name went from CH-AOS to K-AOS, perhaps it could mean that the language neighbor emphasized the \"k\" sound over the \"ch\" sound, as an example). Furthermore, maybe we have other historical examples of what happens to language, words, and pronunciation when a language family that includes significant inflection usage (Indo-European) interacts with a language with an (alleged) Verb+Subject+Object structure (Minoan).\n\nFurthermore, when the Mycenaeans encountered the Minoan civilization, they had to, by necessity, borrow a lot of words from the Minoan vocabulary to make sense of these new words and concepts that they had never encountered before - kings (wanax), boats, ships, wine, olives, etc. So what would come to American English as \"Ohio\" was originally the \"Ohi-yo.\" We know the place names kept their non-Greek names. So why couldn't other words for ships, olives, frescos, and the like transfer? Plus, since the Minoans appear to be significantly less patriarchal, perhaps a lot of the female-related words  came directly from the Minoan?\n\nSo couldn't we log all known instances (and any known pronunciations) across the Mediterranean in some sort of computer system, code it for time and geographic area, test the pronunciation changes with our known linguistic laws, note the changes, and then, by a kind of reverse-engineering, come up with a semblance of a **Minoan language**?\n\nSorry if this was a bit daft or long-winded.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678404447.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

First, language does not change at a regular pace. Norwegian and Icelandic are equal distance in time from Old Norse, yet Icelandic is much closer to their mutual ancestor, for example. \n\nGrimm's law specifically describes changes from Proto-Indo-European into Proto-Germanic and while we can look at similar laws for other languages to get an idea of what changes are common, these laws are not predictive. Sounds can have wildly different changes over the years( did you know that \"zoo\" and \"quick\" are both cognate with \"bio\"? And all three developed through pretty normal sound changes) and the reasons for language change are poorly understood. Although some sound changes can pass from culture to culture like the French uvular \"r\", most sound changes just kinda happen for no obvious reason. This is further complicated by the fact we don't always have exact qualities for sounds. For example, Gothic \ud800\udf42 is some sort of \"r\" but we don't know if it was tapped, trilled, uvular, velar, or a mix of the above. \n\nWith the word borrowings, how do you tell the source of a borrowing without already knowing the source? For example, if you found a Greek word that we don't have a known Proto-Indo-European origin for, how do you tell what the source is? It could be \"Minoan\", or maybe it's from a lost language that we don't know about. Plus, borrowings can start to separate from their origins and start to have pretty drastic changes in meaning (English nice is from Old French \"nice\" meaning \"knows nothing, stupid\") which just makes things even more complicated. \n\nTLDR linguistics is too messy and there are too many unknowns for anyone to attempt to make a model like you're describing","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678462214.0}]},{"title":"Are there any historical inaccuracies in the Quran?","author":"PhysicalArmadillo375","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ncvth\/are_there_any_historical_inaccuracies_in_the_quran\/","text":"While historical inaccuracies in the bible have been well documented, are there any notable historical inaccuracies in the Quran?","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1678417694.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

This business had been his world for many years, as a shareholder in The Globe Theatre, and the Blackfriars Theatre (home of his company of actors now known as \u2018The King\u2019s Men\u2019).\n\nHe had gained a degree of fame as a writer within this world, but it must be remembered that it was actually very small.  London alone in England at this time had a range of dedicated theatrical spaces, and Elizabethan and later Early Stuart era theatre was an almost uniquely London based experience.  London was unusual compared to the rest of the country- due to the specialist nature of trades and skills required we estimate that it had a larger number of literate citizens than elsewhere in England (significantly larger) and theatre had become one of the more popular forms of entertainment in the city.\n\nIt was never THE most popular; by all contemporary accounts the biggest rival to The Globe and The Rose and The Swan Theatre\u2019s of Southwark was their large neighbour, Bear Gardens, the home of London\u2019s designated blood sport (Bear baiting), and this maintained greater crowds than the theatres ever seemed to do.\n\nCrucially however, theatre was a decidedly low brow entertainment, one of the commons, and while yes, nobles did patronise theatre companies (for the money they could make, or the prestige), and while the Queen and later King had commissioned plays to be written, it was never seen as \u2018high brow\u2019.  High brow theatrical type performances tended to be the much more academic based masques, and writing for the Royal Court could be a hit and miss affair.  The Queen had supposedly asked  Shakespeare to write a play based on the character of Falstaff, who Shakespeare had already killed off, which led to him creating the Merry Wives of Windsor to revive the character, while Ben Johnson had delivered \u2018Eastward Ho!\u2019 to King James who had been so offended by a Scottish character in the play he briefly threatened to cut Johnson\u2019s nose and ears off if I remember right (it could have JUST been his nose).\n\nAs such, while Shakespeare was successful enough to buy for his family back up in Stratford-upon-Avon THE largest house in town (New Place) he was not a nationally recognised figure.  Writing for the stage was a tradesmans craft not some great skill of academia, and on a national scale, his fame was decidedly modest.  \n\nWhen he retired from London, he returned to Stratford, doted upon his grandchild, was able to house himself and his son-in-law (and family).\n\nHis passing was a local affair; he was buried locally, able to pay for a small plot within the local church (where he and his wife and daughters and their husbands are buried), but that was it.  So really it wasn\u2019t major.  But there could have been other reasons.  Historian Amanda Mabillard re-quotes C.C. Stopes [here](http:\/\/www.shakespeare-online.com\/faq\/shakespeareremembered.html)\n\n \u201cThe shock and sadness over Burbage's passing may be the key to our understanding of why so little was written on Shakespeare's death just three years earlier - a brilliant theory put so eloquently by C. C. Stopes in Burbage and Shakespeare's Stage:\nShakespeare was out of it all now - away in the quiet Stratford Church he lay. And Richard Burbage, having a son at the end of the year, in memory of him called the child by the name of '\"William.\" It has often been noted by enemies that the world did not seem very much distressed about the death of Shakespeare. No one seems to have grasped the true reason. Shakespeare had retired from the stage, as an actor, some time before he died. His personal appearances in London were rare. \n\nAnd when the end came, and the creation of plays from that source ceased, we have every reason to believe that there was an increase in the number of the performances of his plays. For in the characters Shakespeare wrote for him Richard Burbage attained his greatest glory. Men did not realize that Shakespeare was dead while Burbage lived. His power of impersonation was so great that he became his characters....We have only to turn to the poems referring to Richard Burbage to realize that it was in the death of Burbage that to the world our Shakespeare died\u201d\n\nTrue or not, seven years passed before we saw any serious acknowledgment towards Shakespeare\u2019s writings.  In 1623 John Heminge and Henry Condell assembled his plays into a single large-format edition, the First Folio.  The gap ties into the fact that after Shakespeare died and before that moment, Ben Johnson self-produced his own folio of his works, in many ways kickstarting the fashion for collective works.  It was however still a niche market- it would be many decades before Shakespeare\u2019s words would be venerated as a cornerstone of English literature, and perhaps a measure of just how small the market was when you realise that Johnson himself added the \u201cnot of an age, but for all time\u201d declaration in the preface.\n\nHope that helps.

Sources.** Our sources for the gardens are all in **Greek** (and Latin) language sources. Those sources all place them in Babylon:\n\n  * Berossus of Babylon (C. 4 BCE), reported in Josephus' *Against Apion* 140-141 and *Jewish antiquities* 10.225-227;\n  * Megasthenes (C. 4-3 BCE), *Indica* book 4, reported in Josephus' *Jewish antiquities* 10.225-227 (= *FGrHist* 715 F 1a);\n  * Megasthenes (C. 4-3 BCE) and Abydenus (C. 2 BCE), reported in the Armenian texts of Eusebius' *Praeparatio Evangelica* 9.41 (= *FGrHist* 715 F 1b) and the *Chronica*, p. 19.13-17 Karst = p. 39 Petermann = pp. 55-6 Aucher Ancyranus (citation of Megasthenes at p. 41 ed. Petermann);\n  * Diodorus of Sicily (C. 1 BCE) 2.10.1-6;\n  * Quintus Curtius Rufus (C. 1 CE?), *History of Alexander* 5.1.31-35;\n  * Strabo (C. 2 CE), *Geography* 16.1.5.\n\n(There's one outlier: Pliny, *Natural history* 36.94, puts the gardens at Thebes, Egypt, i.e. Luxor. We'll ignore that.)\n\n**2\\. Dalley's Nineveh argument.** Stephanie Dalley, as others have noted, has made a powerful argument that the gardens described in Greek-language sources are a much better fit for Nineveh than for anything known at Babylon. She's absolutely correct about this: in particular,\n\n * The origin story for the gardens is usually that they were built by Nebuchadnezzar II (Megasthenes, Abydenus, Eusebius, Berossus) or an unnamed Assyrian king (Diodorus, Curtius Rufus) to ease the homesickness of a queen (Megasthenes, Berossus, Curtius Rufus) or concubine (Diodorus), but nostalgic homesickness isn't a theme seen in Babylonian or Assyrian literature: therefore it's likely to be a spurious Greek addition.\n * Josephus and Diodorus describe the gardens as having a 'mountainous' appearance. This is something typical of Assyrian gardens as depicted in panels found at Khorsabad and Nineveh; Babylon, by contrast, is flat as a pancake.\n * Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s citadel at Babylon was 13 metres above the level of the river Euphrates, making hands-free irrigation impossible.\n * Nineveh had an excellent canal system.\n\nThese points work together to show that Nineveh is a more *plausible and realistic* place for the gardens described in the Greek sources. (She has to do some work to disregard the reports of Berossus, who was actually from Babylon: but she could be right, so let's let that bit stand.)\n\n**3\\. OK, so Nineveh is plausible. Does that rule out Babylon?** This is one of the two big catches. Dalley's arguments are focused on showing that Nineveh is *plausible and realistic*. There isn't anything substantive to *rule out* Babylon. OK, so Greek sources describe Archimedean screws in use to irrigate the gardens (several centuries before Archimedes, so yes, they're a misnomer), and there's evidence that Sennacherib had these at Nineveh. That doesn't mean Babylon didn't have them: and bear in mind, the Greek sources unhesitatingly place Archimedean screws at Babylon.\n\n**4\\. Are the gardens supposed to be** ***typical*** **or** ***atypical*****?** The point of the Greek story, in most versions, is that the gardens were supposed to help with the queen's (or concubine's) homesickness for the hills of Assyria. If the gardens are *in* Assyria, that takes away the point of the story! The homesickness only has a point as long as the setting is at Babylon.\n\n**5\\. If we're discarding the Greek stories, then what gardens are we even talking about?** What Dalley has shown, to my mind, is that the story of the gardens is most likely altogether fictional. Bear in mind, we know there are gardens fitting the description at Nineveh: we don't need Greek stories about a homesick queen to tell us that. We haven't got eyewitness accounts of some amazing gardens which are real, and therefore need to be located: what we've got is a literary story, set in Babylon, with a somewhat Greek-looking thematic element, about a homesick queen.\n\nThe 'gardens of Babylon' are more literary construct than real gardens; we know there were *real gardens* at Nineveh, but the home of the *literary construct* is in Babylon. Certainly no 'seven wonders' listmaker ever made a list that had gardens at Nineveh; because the point of the *imaginary gardens in the lists of seven wonders* was that they were in Babylon, real or not.\n\nDoes that help explain why I set this up as falling between the epistemological cracks? It's hard to know at any given moment whether we should be thinking about real Assyrian gardens or imaginary Babylonian gardens.","upvotes":25,"created_utc":1678332786.0}]},{"title":"Why have fun pointy shoes largely gone away for large swaths of humanity?

Something like funny pictures of dogs doing human things generally falls outside the realm of Serious Works and would more typically be documented in an informal way by normal people going about their everyday lives, and might only be commemorated on a bit of paper or (in ancient times) a shard of broken pottery, likely lost or destroyed with time and exposure to the elements. \n\nThere are a few exceptions, however. Funny pictures of animals doing human things was a very popular theme in ancient Egypt, and we\u2019re fortunate that a number of examples have survived in the form of preserved papyri, or more commonly as casual sketches on ostraca (broken bits of stone or pottery) in caches, predominantly from the village of Deir el-Medina, the home of the artisans who built the Valley of the Kings in the Theban necropolis during the New Kingdom period (~1550-1078 BCE) of Egyptian history. It\u2019s very likely that even older such images were created, but were not preserved (or were preserved and I\u2019m not aware of them). \n\nThe images in question are usually standalone scenes of animals standing upright like humans, often wearing human clothing, and engaging in some kind of demonstrably human activity like herding livestock, driving chariots, worshipping at temples, etc. One recurring theme is of power play between mice and cats, wherein mice and cats might fight each other in a battle, or cats serve mice seated on a throne. There isn\u2019t much writing accompanying these images, so it\u2019s hard to tell with certainty whether they were meant as satire, social critique, illustrating a folktale, or simply for the lulz, but it\u2019s likely that depending on the drawing that there was a little of each represented. \n\nAs for the further question of whether people actually dressed their animals up as humans in real life as the man in the photo is doing\u2014well, we\u2019ll probably never know for sure, but Egyptians had a well-documented love of their companion animals, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they behaved with their pets the same way that modern pet owners do. \n\nThis is an excellent article that covers this topic in a great deal more depth and includes a variety of example images, including of specifically dogs dressed up in human clothing: \nhttps:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0752\/10\/3\/40#","upvotes":9,"created_utc":1678402473.0}]},{"title":"Budapest University History Recommendations?","author":"Interesting-Bar6885","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11mwr7b\/budapest_university_history_recommendations\/","text":"Hello!

The question was triggered by coming across a quote on this sub attributed to Muscogee leader Speckled Snake in the context of the debate on Indian Removal in 1829 (only partial reproduction): \n\n>\"Brothers! I have listened to a great many talks from our great father. But they always begin and ended in this- \"Get a little further, you are too near me.\" Brothers! Our great father says that \"where we are now, our white brothers have always claimed the land.\" He speaks with a straight tongue, and cannot lie. But when he first came over the wide waters, while he was yet small, and stood before the great chief at the council on Yamacraw Bluff, he said \"Give me a little land, which you can spare, and I shall pay you for it.\" Brothers! When our great father made us a talk, on a former occasion, and said, \"Get a little further, go beyond the Oconee, the Ocmulgee; there is a pleasant country,\" he also said \"It shall be yours forever.\"\n\nThe terminology here (assuming the quote represents an actual reproduction) seems based on notions of kinship and seems to suggest that the Muscogee understood the Americans to belong to a shared community of common descent, but at the same time I am very much aware this speech was made with a particular rhetorical intent by a leader of a group which had been in contact with the American government and military for decades by that point. Nonetheless, it made me wonder how Native American communities conceived of Americans as a community with a particular political organisation. Given the massive differences in scale in terms of population and resources by the 19th century between the United States as a state versus even the largest Native communities, it seems hard to imagine that such communities would see the former as simply an extremely large kinship network. \n\nThis is not even considering the large variety of social and political traditions between groups sharing little but the label 'Native' assigned to them by white settlers, which must have led to drastically different conceptions of social and political structures. Keeping all that in mind, can there still be any pointers or general introductory statements to give an initial impression of how (some) Native American communities saw the United States?","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678318676.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

For example, in the 1920s, the first written Buck Rogers story has female soldiers, not to mention plenty of pulp fiction heroines and early comic book superheroines. I'm trying to figure out why did early twentieth-century American writers start writing about these types of characters when nineteenth-century writers rarely, if ever, did, let alone portray these female characters taking on the traditionally \"masculine\" role of heroic combat in a positive manner. What changed in American society or pop culture at this time to instigate the emergence of these types of characters during this time period? Did the emergence of this type of character reflect changing societal views on women and their roles in society?

This added to a reputation of a weak Ottoman military that was firmly established throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries, right up to WW I.\n\nIn WW I the primary points of effort in Ottoman strategy were against the Russians in the Caucuses region, and against the British at the Suez canal. The Ottomans made a strategic error at the outset in attempting both these operations separately, and of course they had no chance of being mutually supporting. \n\nThe Caucuses offensive was an unmitigated disaster. The Ottomans generally fought well, but they were completely unprepared logistically to support 100,000 troops in a winter campaign in the mountains. 25,000 Ottoman soldiers died of exposure prior to even fighting the main battle of Sarikamish, which they lost. Of the army of approximately 100,000 men, only about 20,000 made it back to the Ottoman borders in fighting condition. The majority of casualties being from cold and hunger. \n\nThe Suez offensive never had a chance, because the Ottomans only committed 30,000 men to it. Meaning they were actually outnumbered by the British Empire defenders. After a fairly skillful and secretive march to Suez, the Ottomans launched an attack that was fairly easily repulsed by the British. \n\nMeanwhile in modern day Iraq, while the Ottoman Army was successful in delaying the British offensive up the Euphrates, they were forced to continuously fall back and give ground to  the invaders.\n\nAlong with these setbacks in the battlefield, the Ottomans had far less potential military power than the major combatants in WW I, and everyone knew it. They had not and could not mobilize the same sized armies that European powers had raised or were capable of. \n\nSo the attempt to force the straights and take Constantinople through a naval operation was seen as very doable at the time. The Ottoman Navy was much comparatively weaker than evan the Ottoman Army was at the time. It was practically a non-entity. What stopped the naval incursion was a combination of dogged defense by Ottoman gunners, stronger than anticipated coastal forts, timely guidance by German advisors and some recently installed German guns, German submarines, and some very well laid minefields. Several attempts by a large Anglo French fleet were repulsed, resulting in several large warships sunk and damaged, for comparatively little loss to the Ottomans.\n\nThe Gallipoli campaign was the attempt to clear out these defenses so the navy could sail through, occupy or threaten Constantinople, and knock the Ottomans out of the war. \n\nWhy did it fail? The Allies main effort of course was always Europe, so this was a secondary operation in terms of resources, although it's worth pointing out that the Allies actually outnumbered Ottoman defenders during the amphibious landings. But amphibious landings are very difficult and there were many mistakes made by the Allies, who incredibly were only allowed 30 days to plan and start the operation. Offensives in general in WW I were also difficult, with the weaponry and tactics tending to favor the defense. And of course the Ottomans fought very hard and very well. Their troops were mostly prepositioned skillfully to repulse or hem in the Allies, and they kept the high ground which gave them artillery superiority. The Allies were relying on the navy to provide fire support, but eventually the navy was forced to pull out due to German submarines. Ottoman infantry and artillery fought with great skill and determination.\n\nIn summary, it seemed like a good idea at the time because the Ottoman performance since the start of the war had been poor, as expected by the Allies based on prior history. The Gallipoli campaign became a bit of a sunk cost fallacy and mission creep. With an easy victory initially expected, and then more and more resources poured in to try and make that expectation a reality.\n\nThere are many books and accounts of the Gallipoli campaign, but one I by coincidence just finished is what I relied on most for this post. The Fall of the Ottomans, by Rogan.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678364453.0}]},{"title":"Has there ever been a recorded drive by shooting including Thompson submachine guns during the prohibition era?","author":"Which_Helicopter_713","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11mcy3b\/has_there_ever_been_a_recorded_drive_by_shooting\/","text":"It's a common trope in mob media but has it actually ever happened?","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678320687.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

They are the six nations of the [Haudenosaunee Confederacy](https:\/\/www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com\/): Cayuga, Onondoga, Oneida, Mohawk, Seneca, and Tuscarora. (The Tuscarora were latecomers in the 18th century.) The history of the Haudenosaunee is a long and complicated one which I couldn't do justice to here. Their history is intertwined with dozens of other nations, both Indigenous and European, as they were involved in expansionist warfare in early colonial America. I will not be focusing on that, but instead on trying to answer the direct questions you've posted.\n\n**Indian Removal**\n\nThe original homelands of the Haudenosaunee are in what is currently known as New York state. Relocation of the Haudenosaunee began in the 18th century. Most of the nations had sided with the British in the American Revolution. Without consulting their Native allies, the British ceded their territories to the Americans in the Treaty of Paris. As a consequence, many people from the Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondoga, and Seneca nations were resettled by the British to Canada after the war. The Oneida and Tuscarora had allied with the Americans, but some eventually joined this group too. The result today is that the largest First Nations reserve in Canada is the [Six Nations of the Grand River](https:\/\/www.sixnations.ca\/).\n\nIn the 19th century, settler colonial pressures on the land in New York led some Oneida to buy land from the Menominee and Ho-Chunk tribes of Wisconsin. The Menominee and Ho-Chunk were pressured by the government to agree to the sale. In 1822, they agreed to share their land with the Oneida and a few other New York tribes in exchange for $5000 worth of goods. Tensions between the incomers and the Menominee went on for some time. This was not a forced removal akin to the Trail of Tears, but it happened because the Oneida were losing so much of their land in New York that they felt they had no choice but to move west.\n\nTo this day, many Oneida people live on their reservation near Green Bay. [The Oneida Nation of Wisconsin](https:\/\/oneida-nsn.gov\/) is a legally separate entity to the [Oneida Indian Nation](https:\/\/www.oneidaindiannation.com\/) in New York. There is also a branch of the Oneida in Canada, the [Oneida Nation of the Thames](https:\/\/oneida.on.ca\/) in Ontario, which was similarly formed by Oneida people purchasing land, though in this case in an area where they had a claim to hunting grounds going back to the 1701 Nanfan Treaty.\n\nOther Haudenosaunee people were forced west in more typical Indian removal. Groups of Seneca and Cayuga people who had relocated to Ohio in the 18th century were forced to move to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in the 19th century. Their trip from Ohio to Oklahoma took eight months, and there was much illness and death on the journey. The lands they had been given turned out to belong to the Cherokee, and so legal disputes followed their arrival. Over the next several decades, other Seneca and Cayuga people joined them in their reservation there, though some were rejected and sent to Canada. Today this group in Oklahoma is officially incorporated as the [Seneca-Cayuga Nation](http:\/\/sctribe.com\/).\n\nFinally, the Tuscarora were not originally members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. By the time of European contact, they had long since migrated to the Carolinas. After they were driven from their homelands in the 18th century Tuscarora War, they fled north and were eventually sponsored by the Oneida to join the Confederacy. Today there are groups in the Carolinas who claim descent from the Tuscarora, but they are not recognised by the Tuscarora Nation in New York and have struggled to receive federal recognition. Some people of Tuscarora descent are also part of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation in Oklahoma mentioned above.\n\nIn spite of these many removals, all six of the Haudenosaunee Nations have territories in New York. These are mostly in the form of typical Indian reservations. You can see a map of the existing reservations in New York [here](https:\/\/www.gifex.com\/detail-en\/2009-09-18-9653\/New_York_Federal_Lands_and_Indian_Reservations_United_States.html). Note that some tribes are split between multiple reservations.\n\n**Residential schools**\n\nLike most Native American tribes, members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy's nations were forced into residential schools. In 1831, the Mohawk Institute Residential School was established in Ontario. It operated until 1970. Over the years there have been many allegations of abuse at the school, including the construction of a prison cell for holding students who tried to run away. Following recent calls to investigate former residential schools for students' death, 97 deaths of children at the institute have been confirmed, more than twice the original estimate of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.\n\nSimilar schools operated in American Haudenosaunee territories. In 1855, missionaries Asher and Laura Wright established the Thomas Indian School at the Seneca Cattaragus Indian Reservation. The Wrights kidnapped Seneca children and forced them to attend the school. The Oneida in Wisconsin also had the residential school system imposed on them. Between 1893 and 1918, the Oneida Boarding School operated on the grounds of the Oneida reservation in Wisconsin. Some Oneida students also attended the Tomah Indian Industrial School which was an off-reservation school opened in 1893 to educate the Ho-Chunk.\n\nMuch earlier, the Tuscarora had been targeted by Indian school efforts before they were forced out of the Carolinas. Tuscarora students attended the Braffteron Indian School in the early 18th century.\n\nBeyond just the schools in Haudenosaunee territory, many students were sent much further afield to residential schools across North America. The Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania had significant numbers of Seneca and Oneida students.

But it was valuable enough that you see things like the Social War in Italy, non-citizens being willing to do 25 years in the legion auxiliary to earn it, etc.\n\nHowever, in the early 3rd century, Caracalla extended citizenship to all free males in the empire. How did this change policy in the late empire? What about for migrants into the Roman Empire (for example the \"barbarians\" - were they instantly extended citizenship or did they still have to do some sort of citizenship service?)\n\nHow was Roman citizenship treated after the west fell? Did the \"Byzantines\" care? I know some of the Italian population still saw themselves as Romans during Justinian's reconquest - would they have been treated like Roman citizens? How would that have differed from barbarian treatment?

Biased people decide what gets included in the school curriculum, biased authors write textbooks, biased teachers are tasked with educating students who themselves are already likely biased. I'm not familiar enough with Egypt's educational system to say whether it is designed to deliberately promote anti-Israel or anti-US historical narratives. However, I can say that when historical subjects are relevant to modern politics, teachers are much more likely to give oversimplified, heavily slanted explanations of the past--whether they mean to or not--usually because of a combination of legal, job security, or personal concerns. \n\nThe narrative of events you describe is _heavily_ slanted against Israel, but most of it sounds more like extremely biased takes on real events rather than outright lies. The most glaring error, and the only thing I feel comfortable calling an outright lie, is that first bit. Neither American politicians nor politicians of any European country forced Jews to settle in Palestine. \n\nThough persecution under antisemitic regimes put significant pressure on Jews to depart from their home countries, no regime specifically deported Jews to Palestine. Rather, Palestine was a very popular destination for European Jews fleeing persecution. Note that I am using 'Palestine' as a geographic term here--not a political one. There was no Palestinian state prior to 1988, and Israel emerged out of the 1947-1948 civil war in what was previously British (and before them, Ottoman) controlled territory.

From both pictures and descriptions we have from both Ancient Greek and mediaeval works of natural history (like a Byzantine copy of a work by Dioscorides, possibly the most famous ancient Western botanist, and after whom we get *Dioscorea*, the scientific name for the yam genus), and even paintings well into the Renaissance, they could be orange, but also red, yellow, purple, white and other shades. These other carrot colours still exist, but are far less popular, while the distribution was far more evenly spread back then. It is only later in the early modern period - after oranges were widespread - that carrots became associated so closely with orange. Oranges by contrast were always orange (though of course they are one of many hybrid citrus fruits of many colours). \n\nCarrots reached Europe much earlier than oranges, originating in Central Asia and Iran, and having been known to the classical Greeks. Citrus fruit in general were known to South East Asia and India in ancient - even prehistoric - times, but only reached Europe in significant numbers after the Islamic expansion and conquest of Spain. So both arrived in Europe via Persia, but at quite different times, so that for a long while oranges were seen as more \u2018exotic\u2019, and were much more expensive, there. \n\nUnlike carrots, oranges were relatively expensive and exotic, and names of colours used for decoration (and heraldry, with an example below) tended to be from flowers, expensive dye sources, etc. rather than common vegetables. \u2018Orange\u2019 as a colour word started out as a particular \u2018poetic\u2019 choice for its colour, where at least in English \u2018yellow-red\u2019 (\u2018geoluhread\u2019 in Old English) had been used more generally before. \n\nIn fact, there is some debate about whether this might even not be a coincidence - that carrots are now usually orange *because* oranges are orange - but as usual the truth is a lot more complex. This is extremely close to a very popular anecdote of sorts that I hope I\u2019m allowed to address. \n\nThe rather cute but meandering etymological story goes like this: \u2018orange\u2019 comes from the ancient Tamil (or other Dravidian) word for \u2018fragrant fruit\u2019, or \u2018narangal\u2019. This is turn went through Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic - following the spread of the fruit- before ending up in Spain as \u2018naranja\u2019. The \u2018n\u2019 was then rebracketed, conflated with the \u2018n\u2019 from \u2018un\u2019, in Occitan and then French to be \u2018une orange\u2019 (this isn\u2019t uncommon: \u2018a napron\u2019 became \u2018an apron\u2019, \u2018a numpire\u2019 became \u2018an umpire\u2019).  This became used for the colour, as is not uncommon with plants considered to have aesthetic value (violet, indigo, pink, lavender, lilac, saffron, etc. - all more glamorous than a root vegetable, it must be said). \n\nThe small town of Arausio in ancient Gaul, named after a Celtic river god, went through multiple sound changes and eventually became \u2018Orange\u2019, easily conflated with the name of the fruit, and its ruling family became the Counts of Orange, and then through intermarriage a line came to rule Nassau, converted to Protestantism, and were brought in to defend the Netherlands from Spain - eventually becoming the dominant stadtholder - and now royal - family of the Netherlands. Naturally, the family\u2019s chosen colour was orange, and this colour came to represent the Netherlands. \n\nThe story goes that the Netherlands dominated European trade to such an extent that they managed to favour the orange carrot for patriotic reasons to the point that it became the dominant cultivar. (Some versions even go so far as to say they *created* orange carrots, though this is certainly false as we do have records of orange carrots that predate the Dutch Republic). Unfortunately, the truth is difficult to pin down. It is true that the Dutch dominated a great deal of agricultural maritime trade, and it is over the course of the early modern that the production of orange carrots relative to others exploded. It is also possible that one particular strain may have been favoured elsewhere and boomed very rapidly to replace others elsewhere, which may have had multiple advantages including the symbolic link, rather than the Dutch managing to drown out the supply by sheer quantity. However, we do not have solid evidence that the Dutch did have a major selection in favour of the colour (which was not the royal national colour it is now - it did not even appear on the Republic\u2019s flag - EDIT: or per u\/Paixdieu\u2019s comment below, the red-white-blue and Prince\u2019s orange-white-blue flags were at least blurred together as flags of \u2018the Republic\u2019 - orange was not the Dutch national colour in the manner it is today), and nor do we have clear evidence that the bulk of modern carrots descend from ones grown in the Netherlands or selected by Dutch traders (EDIT: apparently for this point we do, see the 2013 paper linked below in the correction by u\/Paixdieu, but we do lack any solid evidence that it was the Dutch selecting orange specifically for this reason). Have to admit that the idea that \u201cCarrots are orange because oranges are orange and \u2018fragrant fruit\u2019 in Old Tamil sounds a little like the name of a Gaulish river god\u201d would be a delightful fun fact - but we just don\u2019t have solid evidence for that last link, even if it gets repeated by major media outlets on occasion. (But we can at least make a similar claim about the Dutch royal colour!)","upvotes":2035,"created_utc":1678213382.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1678204259.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678200283.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1678213202.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-2,"created_utc":1678222319.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-2,"created_utc":1678231915.0}]},{"title":"How 'dark' were the 'dark ages' really in Europe?","author":"Wild_Stop_1773","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11mklzl\/how_dark_were_the_dark_ages_really_in_europe\/","text":"i am very much interested in this period, and wanted to get this sub's perspective on it.","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678342247.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

One of the few exceptions is his age: he was about 50 years old when he married his 17-year-old niece Gorgo and became king. The battle of Thermopylai followed about 10 years later. In other words, at the time of the only battle in which we are sure Leonidas was personally involved, he would have been about 60 years old. In Sparta, like in other Greek states, men of that age would normally no longer be liable for military service. He was sent out to lead the army only because he was one of the two kings. No one would have expected this senior citizen to do particularly well in combat, and our sources make no reference to his ability as a warrior.\n\nBy contrast, Alexander III of Macedon died at the tender age of 32. Everything he did, he did in the prime of his life. Though the surviving accounts of his achievements are late and coloured by embellishment, they contain many credible anecdotes of his personal prowess in battle, which was a cornerstone of his royal image. Emulating both his father and his great hero Achilles, Alexander led from the front with reckless abandon and regularly exposed himself to extreme danger to inspire his troops. He spent his whole life fighting; he used his own weapons against the enemy with lethal force on numerous occasions (and against a close friend at least once).\n\nYou can imagine that comparing these two historical figures as warriors is not exactly comparing like with like.\n\nIn any case, the Spartans were never known to be particularly skilled warriors. We have no evidence that they trained in the use of weapons. In the century and a half after Thermopylai, their advantage over other Greeks lay in their superior organisation and infantry drill, which allowed them to march calmly in step and perform rudimentary manoeuvres; since other Greeks did not train in groups at all, this modest ability gave the Spartans a significant edge in battle. But no one seems to have regarded them *individually* as capable fighters, either in unarmed combat or with edged weapons. The Theban general Epameinondas is said to have encouraged Thebans to challenge Spartans in the wrestling ring, calculating that if they learned that they could overcome Spartans there, they would become confident that they could do it on the battlefield as well. Apparently there was no doubt that a healthy Theban could beat a Spartan in fair conditions. Even Herodotos - who describes the battle of Thermopylai and is heavily invested in the notion of Spartan heroism - has the exiled Spartan king Demaratos express doubt whether he could reliably defeat a Persian Immortal in single combat. This was not their strength. In single combat they were merely as good as any other. It was in their formations, buttressed by their collective willpower and obedience, that they were able to overcome any enemy.\n\nIt is true that Leonidas (exceptionally, for a king) went through the Spartan upbringing as a child, and would therefore have been moulded in the Spartan way just like any other male Spartan citizen. But we learn from later descriptions of this upbringing that it included no specifically military elements. It consisted primarily of fitness training and indoctrination in the values that would make a Spartan useful to his city: courage, self-denial, and obedience to the laws, the gods, and the elders. This upbringing contributed to the collective strength of Spartan battle formations that Demaratos claimed to be their great strength. If they performed well in battle, it was not because each Spartan was good with a spear, but because each Spartan was inculcated to believe that he must perform as his society demanded. Spartans were probably more fit than the average Greek, since all Spartans were leisure-class citizens required by law to spend much of their leisure exercising their bodies. But, like all Greeks, they valued courage, agility and stamina more than strength or skill.\n\nWe do not know if old Leonidas personally killed anyone at Thermopylai. It is certainly possible, but no source records it. Most likely, like other Spartan kings, he was not fighting in the very front rank of his formation, so his tent companions would have done most of the bloody work - but eventually he was exposed to a lethal Persian blow. The most detailed account of the fighting that survives in Herodotos comes after Leonidas has fallen, and his men are seen fighting memorably over possession of his corpse. Unfortunately this is one of the most \"epic\" scenes in Herodotos, and many historians doubt whether it is authentic; it may simply be an attempt to draw on Homer to describe the fight in suitable terms. How would Herodotos have known, anyway, what happened in the final engagement where all the remaining Greeks were killed?\n\nThe difference with Alexander is stark. As I said, we have plenty of accounts of Alexander in the thick of the fighting, dealing and taking blows. We also know that he would have trained much of his life to ride and fight, since the sons of Macedonian nobles were raised in these arts together, and by that time even those who did not have their own skills to pass on to their sons would be able to hire travelling drillmasters to do it for them. He would have been ready for battle from the time he was a teenager, and battle-hardened ever since. While his many wounds - some badly healed - and his frequent and excessive drinking might have made Alexander less adept in combat as his campaign wore on, there is no doubt that he was experienced and confident in a fight, which his contemporaries believed to matter a great deal more than training in fancy moves. A large part of his ability to inspire his troops to unprecedented conquests was the fact that he was always ready to give his men the right example.\n\nIn short, there is a considerable gulf between the warrior roles played by Leonidas and Alexander, and it is likely that there was a similar gulf between their abilities to overcome opponents. Leonidas was old, more of a figurehead at this point in his life, and previously untested in combat (as far as we know). While he was certainly expected to fight alongside his men, they placed their trust more in moral and physical endurance than combat skill, and that was the example he provided at Thermopylai, fighting near the front with his trusted bodyguards to keep the enemy at bay. Alexander, on the other hand, prided himself in recklessness, and frequently had to be saved from harm by the bodyguards he had left trailing in his wake. He was a young and hot-headed brawler whose leadership style was based on constantly exceeding expectations, including in his ability to commit violence by his own hand.","upvotes":14,"created_utc":1678401052.0}]},{"title":"Many suspect the \"dark lady\" Shakespeare describes in some of his sonets is black.

David Olusoga's *Black and British* details the history of that presence (it's also a decent BBC documentary); Olivette Otele's recent book *African Europeans* puts it in broader perspective and draws upon a growing body of scholarly research on early modern and medieval African presence in Western Europe. \n\nIt's also worth keeping in mind that there are a number of Shakespeare scholars who have insisted that the figure of the \"dark lady\" was not meant to be a specific real person that Shakespeare was addressing but instead an imaginary figure or character. It's still interesting in that case that Shakespeare was imagining a non-white person, whether of African descent or otherwise, and an indirect indicator of presence or familiarity.","upvotes":32,"created_utc":1678300227.0},{"author":"treowlufu","text":"Archeological evidence also suggests there were small communities of Africans settled in England as early as 5th century Roman Britain, who most likely moved north as part of the legion.

One of the earliest African communities to convert to Christianity was Ethiopia, and they travelled too, so we know that it wasn't only lighter-skinned Northern Africans travelling in Europe, but Berber Moors, and many others. Trade was widespread.\n\nThe shorter answer is that, though the diversity was not as widespread as today, there's no reason Black people wouldn't have been in England in the 16th century.

Due to the 20 year rule only events up through 2003 are up for discussion. Meanwhile, the Global Positioning System, GPS, only existed in a partial state in the late '80s through early '90s before coming fully online in 1993. Though Reagan had expressed a commitment for GPS to be open to civilian use when operational, at that time handsets and GPS equipment were still quite bulky and expensive. Additionally the system was subject to \"selective availability\" which could result in positioning deviations as great as 0.1 km during periods (and locations) of military conflict where the signal available to civilians was intentionally degraded, which resulted in the system not being used for critical purposes outside of the military. Only after policy changes during the Clinton administration (first declaring GPS a \"dual-use\" system with an official civilian application then removing selective availability entirely) which culminated in 2000 did the system begin to be widely adopted by civilians. While the Russian GLONASS system was also not completed until 1995. That time frame also coincided with the rise of increasingly inexpensive and ubiquitous GPS receivers beginning to be introduced into more and more applications.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that implementations such as ADS-B (where planes determine and broadcast their GPS coordinates) as well as AIS (where boats broadcast signals to help other boats track them) have only been implemented either post 2003 or very soon before then.\n\nThis means there's a very narrow window from perhaps 1993 to 2003 or from 2000 to 2003 for possible answers to your question that satisfy the criterion of global positioning systems being in use, and even then such usage was not commonplace at that time.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678304600.0}]},{"title":"The Rig Veda says: \"Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the swarthy skin which Indra hates.\" This ancient collection of Sanskrit poetry contains a number of racially charged passages.

So, there are (much) more \"Christian\" stones, that is to say, presumably erected by the Christian Scandinavians *based either on text or on iconography* than generally assumed, due to this concentration on later period.  \n* The majority of extant corpus also concentrates in now Sweden, especially in Central Sweden, thus rune stones might also have a bias against the quantitative analysis to illustrate the regional difference, as I also mentioned in: [I recently became interested in Viking history wondering what the state if Viking literacy was pre 12th century?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/zggrlo\/i_recently_became_interested_in_viking_history\/) \n\nSome other important premises are:  \n\n* The most popular \"(sub-)genre\" of runic stones in (Late) Viking Age Scandinavia is the commemoration stone that the person X raised the stone \"in memory of\" person Y. Y had generally been deceased, and often a relative to the commissioner X (so the recent scholarship often tries to make use of the stones as a source either for the family consciousness or for the inheritance pattern in Viking Age Scandinavia). \n* It was local magnates rather than ordinary farmers that commissioned the erection of rune stones, and some stones also specify name of the (professional) rune carver in their inscription. A few stones are commissioned by such magnates even in his lifetime to boast their deeds in the local society, but they probably belonged to the minority. \n* Many rune stones also have a rich decoration (iconography), but it is rather rare to correlate between the content of the inscription and illustrated decorations) - this is why the latter opinion (limited source value) is prevailed among researchers. It also means that we should generally rely on the texts from later times like both *Eddas* to \"decipher\" otherwise un-annotated\/ unnamed illustrations allegedly on gods and heroes.  \n\n+++  \n\nWell, sorry for the long and clumsy introduction.  \n\nThe following is an example of (Christian) runic inscription from now Western Sweden (V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland) around 1100 CE:  \n\n>\"\u01eazurr and Sveinn and \u00de\u00f3rir, they laid this stone over their mother \u00d3l\u01ebf. May God and God's mother [Maria] and all of God's angels help her soul (Vg 50).\"    \n\nThis is a rare example of mention of angels in runic stones, but the commissioner brothers quote Christian God, Virgin Mary, and them for offering the protection to the commemorated person [\u00d3l\u01ebf, their mother (corrected)].  \n\nWe can at least find a few of pre-Christian parallel of this prayer among the extant inscriptions, such as that in \u00d6land (in the Baltic): \n\n>\"\u00a7A Here I carve(d) protection for you, B\u00f3fi, with\/\u2026 \u2026 to you is certain. And may the lightning hold all evil away from B\u00f3fi. May \u00de\u00f3rr protect him with that hammer which came from out \u00a7B of the sea(?). Flee from evilness! You\/it get\/gets nothing from B\u00f3fi. The gods are under him and over him (\u00d6l SAS1989;43).\"  \n\nAnother, probably much more popular example of invoking to pre-Christian god(s) as a curse\/ warning to damage the stone is found in Glavendrup Stone in Fyn, Denmark (around 900 CE):  \n\n>\"\u00a7A Ragnhildr placed this stone in memory of Alli the Pale, priest of the sanctuary, honourable \u00feegn of the retinue. \u00a7B Alli's sons made these monuments in memory of their father, and his wife in memory of her husband. And S\u00f3ti carved these runes in memory of his lord. \u00de\u00f3rr hallow these runes. \u00a7C A warlock be he who damages(?) this stone or drags it (to stand) in memory of another (DR209 - A\/ B\/ C represents individual sides of the stone).\" \n\nWhile these inscriptions (especially that of Gravendrup) shed a little light to the religious practice and beliefs of the commissioners to be sure (and especially valuable), they unfortunately offers not so much on what we usually expect as \"myths\", I suppose.  \n\nOn the other hand, several illustrations of the stones apparently allude to the episode of gods and heroes as illustrated in medieval Icelandic manuscripts, but they are also unfortunately not directly related to the inscription on stone at all in most cases AFAIK.  \n\nTo give an example of such an illustration, [that of U 1161 (Altuna Stone - early 11th century)](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bd\/Altunastenen_U_1161_%28Ra%C3%A4-nr_Altuna_42-1%29_Tors_fiskaf%C3%A4nge_0646.jpg) must be familiar to us - a person with hammer on the ship and a snake-like figure that implies the famous fishing expedition of \u00de\u00f3rr (Thor). The attached inscription, however, tell us nothing on this episode itself:  \n\n>\"\u00a7A V\u00e9fastr, Folka\u00f0r, Gu\u00f0varr (?) had the stone raised in memory of their father Holmfastr, (and in memory of) Arnfastr. \u00a7B Both father and son were burned, and Balli (and) Freysteinn, of Hl\u00edfsteinn's retinue, carved (U 1161).\"  \n\nWhat this famous iconography confirms is that the commissioners (and probably the carver himself) of this Altuna stone was not Christians and respected \u00de\u00f3rr at the period when the stone was commissioned to raise, but that's almost the all we can say. \n  \nAnother, often cited kind of image of Old North myths on the stone actually comes from picture stones (image stones) erected in Gotland (Sweden), often even without the attached inscription.  \n\nI'll cite Tj\u00e4ngvide Stone (G110) here as an example here:  \n\n* [The image](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/74\/Tj%C3%A4ngvide.jpg), especially the bearded figure on horseback is often interpreted as \u00d3\u00f0inn.  \n* On the other hand, the inscription on this stone is apparently very concise: \"\u00a7A <fu\u00feork> \u2026 \u00a7B \u2026 raised the stone in memory of Hj\u01ebrulfr\/J\u00f3rulfr, his brother \u2026\" \n\nSo, since the inscription rarely refers to the detailed episode of gods and heroes apparently illustrated together on the stone, the stone is generally of little use to explore the new evidence of Old Norse myths (both Altuna and Tj\u00e4ngvide stones don't even specify that the illustrated figures are actually \u00de\u00f3rr or \u00d3\u00f0inn!).  \n\nAt last, however, I'd like to point out that there is another kind of primary texts possibly dates back to Viking Age Scandinavia.   \n\nSkalds (court poets) served the ruler in Viking Age Scandinavia, and their poem with complicated metres often makes use of \"kennings\", the improvised metaphorical compound often based on the famous episodes of gods and heroes.   \n\nThey (or fragments of their poetry) are extant in form of quoted verses in the sagas, and Snorri's *Edda* is also said to have originally composed as a handbook to such poems.  \n\nSome recent scholarship also tries to make use of this skaldic poems and its kennings as a changing representation of pre-Christian gods in Viking Age and also in medieval period (Abram 2010). \n\nReferences:  \n\n* Runinskrift DR 209 i Samnordisk runtextdatabas 2020, Institutionen f\u00f6r nordiska spr\u00e5k, Uppsala universitet. http:\/\/kulturarvsdata.se\/uu\/srdb\/8a2934e0-e190-41b9-b25a-36373f3bc1bc  \n* Runinskrift G 110 i Samnordisk runtextdatabas 2020, Institutionen f\u00f6r nordiska spr\u00e5k, Uppsala universitet. http:\/\/kulturarvsdata.se\/uu\/srdb\/90c55427-c694-4db1-9c9f-35cefbd09825\n* Runinskrift U 1161 i Samnordisk runtextdatabas 2020, Institutionen f\u00f6r nordiska spr\u00e5k, Uppsala universitet. http:\/\/kulturarvsdata.se\/uu\/srdb\/a44cd8a3-cfbb-4e7d-98a0-124e88d0d16f\n* Runinskrift Vg 50 i Samnordisk runtextdatabas 2020, Institutionen f\u00f6r nordiska spr\u00e5k, Uppsala universitet. http:\/\/kulturarvsdata.se\/uu\/srdb\/fbdc16ee-17d2-4889-9651-cb0fd91367ed\n* Runinskrift \u00d6l SAS1989;43 i Samnordisk runtextdatabas 2020, Institutionen f\u00f6r nordiska spr\u00e5k, Uppsala universitet. http:\/\/kulturarvsdata.se\/uu\/srdb\/b64e6a1b-72ec-429b-a44e-96167e8ed4a2\n\n+++  \n\n* Abram, Christopher. *Myths of the Pagan North: The Gods of the Northmen.* London: Continuum, 2010. \n* Barnes, Michael P. *Runes: A Handbook.* Woodbridge: Boydell, 2012. \n* Heslop, Kate. *Viking Mediologies*.

We do distinguish between the Roman Regnum, the Roman Republic, the \"Roman Empire\", and then Byzantium. \n\nThe \"Germany\" of today could be said to have only existed in 1991 with reunification, or maybe it changed under Nazi Germany, or the Weimar Republic... etc. But modern Germany came about in 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty, and before that it was a German Confederation that sat beside Prussia. \n\nEngland became a republic in 1649 before reformed back into it's kingdom in 1660, but we don't regard England as ceasing to exist for that period. We DO seem to distinguish between England and what could be considered an English hegemony in the form of Great Britain, and then the United Kingdom. \n\nSo you can see the clear distinctions... sort of. But it seems inconsistent, and this is further compounded by the Chinese Dynastic Cycle, which (maybe in the spirit of nationalism) China would argue as a more or less continuous \"nation of China\" broken up by a particular ruling dynasty and then periods of interegnum. I take most issue with this perception because China itself was conquered by the Mongols but somehow the Yuan dynasty is considered a part of the cycle. \n\nSo here's my issues:\n\n* It's clearly not based on type of government or how long a particular government rules.\n* It's clearly not based on a particular geography as the center of regional power seems to constantly shift, wax, and wane.\n* There does seem to come a point where identities change, though. Rome was simply Rome, even though all rights were concentrated among the citizenry, who themselves were citizens of Rome. It didn't become anything \"more\", ie it isn't referred to as the \"Italian Empire\" or \"European Empire\". However, England becomes GB, then UK... \n\nIt seems to basically be based on who has hegemony, and who has rights. In Rome a limited few had true \"citizen rights\", though there was plenty of stratification. In the UK, English folks aren't superior, they are held equal with Wales, Scotland, etc. In America, though, the people of Guam or Puerto Rico are American citizens, even though their lands have no actual representation at the regional level. \n\nNow that's I've given my train of thought, I'd like to hear from historians on this.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678202543.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

As this is a contentious subject I'm sure others will chime in to contribute, but I'll try and give an overview of the *frame* of the question at hand here. That you are seeing inconsistency is the key here- it is inconsistent, and a large part of that is that this isn't a solved subject.\n\nWhat constitutes a polity and its extension through time and space? In the modern day we often think of \"the state\"- a huge complex of officials, politicians, the public sector, the military etc., and the area they control. Whether and how the population in that area relates to the state is something people have differing opinions on these days- to some, the people constitute the state as equal citizens, and to others this is a fairy tale, and we simply live our lives while states share out the globe. What constitutes the state here is the *institutions of state*, the structure of the military, the offices of the executive, the laws of courts. So long as there is a hierarchy and chain of reference that leads back to the centre (e.g., something being the **U.S.** Department of bla bla, taking orders from the president, etc.), then we see it as one state. This is a very positive-law and technocratic outlook on the world, drawing from folks like Kelsen, Hart, and others.\n\nA somewhat more 20th-century view of things, though it still constitutes many people's view of states, is the *nation state*. Here, a nation is preconceived- often as a historical entity, tied together through blood, language, religion or something else- and the state is the instantiation or *self-determination* of that nation. Here, the continuity of the state or empire takes second place to the continuity of the nation. Fascistic ideas of a master race are extreme examples of this, of course, but you can see the political necessity for the nation from the postcolonial and post-imperial non-European states and their attempts to excavate an ethnic national history in the early 20th century (see the Sun Language Theory in Turkey or the Indigenous Aryanism of India). \n\nEarlier still, one might speak of an Imperial frame of statehood (used loosely). The Holy Roman Empire, the Russian Tsardom, and the Ottoman Empire all perceived and represented themselves as heirs to the Roman Imperial tradition- despite making much less of an argument for any blood or ethnic relation, much less one of direct legal equivalence. Here, the recognition of some great imperial framework is the basis, and states that fill the space are taken as potential successors, their victory dependent on their fulfilment of the supposed past glory. China is perhaps the chief example of this, where the relatively stable geography for the \"Middle Kingdom\" imperial space did not die out, and successive polities sought to claim it as their title.\n\nF\u0130nally, you can have a dynastic notion of a polity. A given structure, people or imperial space here is second to lineage. The post-Mongol Central Asia is a great example of this, as the many khandoms that reigned until the 18th-19th centuries touted their Chinggisid heritage, or otherwise conjured some near-dynastic relation to the Chinggisids (an example is the Russian Tsar naming himself Khan in the 16th century due to his suzerainty over the Chinggisid Kasim clan). Another example is the dynastic politics of Early Modern Europe, with families like the Hapsburgs holding seemingly completely unrelated lands through marriage and inheritance.\n\nThese don't cover all the options, and of course you don't have to choose one or the other; my point in listing these is that for any given person, their understanding of what a state or polity is is going to be a jumble of these and other ideas layered on top of one another. Additionally, any example you think of will be embedded in its own context- you can't really talk about a Habsburg \"nation\" before the 18th century, or an uninterrupted French state structure until at least the mid-17th, or any dynastic link from Qin Shi Huang to Empress Dowager Cixi; more importantly, in many such cases the people of the time would have no idea what you meant by \"nation\" or \"state\" or \"administration\", and where they did have equivalents it would be far removed from our modern context.\n\nThe challenge, at the end of the day, is that this is a question that lies at the overlap of multiple disciplines, and academics often don't like crossing those lines. You might get polisci folks giving you clean-cut Weberian definitions, or historians telling you any word that comes out of your mouth is anachronism (the cardinal sin!). The fact of the matter is that this is an issue that is not resolved. Should we categorise the Later Han and the Dutch Republic as in the same category, but just subdivided? Or are they different things altogether, and there's no overarching term? Should we even categorise at all, or just refer to the terms used within the context we are discussing? Historians and social scientists alike have no consensus on the matter, so like I wrote at the start, your confusion just shows you've perceived this.\n\nI'll end on a more resolute point, however (and hereon is more opinion). Just because academics have not come to an agreement, does not mean that there is not an answer. More immediately, that there is no definitive, analytically clean answer does not mean that there are not *practical answers*. That's why people still refer to the Roman Empire, the United States, the Russian Tsardom etc. Complex as the nitty gritty might be, we gotta do history - and so we use these terms we're used to, and worry about the imperfections when they arise. These terms can be replaced- but they need to be replaced by *something*. As much as academics discuss, the prevalence of these terms won't go away unless some practical alternative is provided- and I don't just mean a different term to take their exact place, but some different *practice* if such clumping together is argued to be bad. So keep in mind that this doesn't have to be an unanswerable, never-ending question. We're just working with older tools that are beginning to give to the depredations of time, and though many notice this, a contender is yet to emerge to take their place. \n\n**TL;DR**: It is complicated, historians and other scholars are still arguing about it, but there is space for new ideas and suggestions.","upvotes":160,"created_utc":1678211487.0},{"author":"swarthmoreburke","text":"It is indeed a great question, and strikes to the heart of a major challenge with historical writing.\n\nMy field struggles with this issue in particularly intense ways. What do we call societies in sub-Saharan Africa where we can see some form of cultural, linguistic, and sociopolitical coherence over time but where the names we use now are modern ethnonyms or national identifiers that were not only conferred in many cases by European colonizers but where the kinds of coherence residing in those groups and nations today are substantially an instrumental product of colonial administration?\n\nThat's what leads many African intellectuals and writers to say \"we need new names\" (the title both of a novel by NoViolet Bulawayo and a terrific essay by Mbongiseni Buthelezi). But historians need *old* names and in many cases we don't have them--we have no idea what people whose coherence we can see evidence for called themselves within their own frameworks of identity and we have no idea what some states or communities titled themselves despite having abundant evidence of their existence. \n\nEven the old names that we do have were often conferred by outsiders--travellers, neighboring societies, and so on. So often historians have to settle for some kind of explanatory prologue that explains that the words we're going to use are just placeholders and that readers need to always bracket them mentally. So, for example, Akinwumi Ogundiran's new history of Yoruba communities uses \"Yoruboid\" and other slightly distanced words to talk about the deep history of the ancestors of the people who are today known as Yoruba, but he also accepts that he's got to use the modern word a fair amount even when he's talking about a historical period where the people he's designating did not understand themselves as *one people.* \n\nThat's not that different ultimately from the problem of what to call \"Germans\" in an era when they didn't really understand themselves as \"Germans\" and yet did understand that they were connected with one another in a way that differentiated them from other groups and principalities in Central Europe. We often settle for \"Germans\" because it's the only way to talk about that connection comprehensibly for modern readers. It's just that for African societies and nations--and many other non-Western examples--there's an extra layer of trouble on top of that where the names used now were tools used to rule over them.","upvotes":32,"created_utc":1678225392.0},{"author":"battl3mag3","text":"I'd recommend reading Benedict Anderson's work Imagined Communities, for an extremely influential input in the theory of nationalism.\n\nThere is a great controversy in historiography between nationalist and other ways of writing history. Nationalist history forms the mainstream standard we are used to, both because history is an incredibly important building block of nationalism, and because most of the history we consider common knowledge was written in a period where nationalism was *the* way to look at the world. For many, especially so outside the West, it still is. The history of history as a science is very much tied to nationalism. Now nationalist historiography assumes that there is something essentially national in all the political entities that culminated into a certain modern nation state. This essence is what binds them together. As you said, Chinese nationalist historiography assumes \"China\" to be millennia old, and that the modern Chinese nation state is just the purest form of this essence of nation expressed.\n\nRights are key, and especially key is realising that most people never had much \"rights\" ever in history. This is what the school of historians critical of nationalist historiography often emphasize. Nationalism was born in the late 1700's in Europe, when linguistic standardisation through printed media created unified cultures, and when the republican political revolutions turned people from  *subjects* to *citizens*. In this sense, if were technical, for example France as we understand it did not exist before 1789, although a kingdom of France, essentially a personal domain of an aristocratic line, did exist, and governed roughly the same geographic are and the same demographic.\n\nOf course there is institutional continuation between the dynastic regimes of old and many nation states. Its ultimately a matter of using language that is reasonably accurate to convey the right meaning, but vague enough not to lose any. We can safely speak about France in the medieval era, as long as we mind it meaning something totally different, yet related to the nation state. If we deny using the national name at all, it doesn't do justice to the pre-nationalist usage of the same name. \n\nThen again, after the invention of nationalism, I'd say there's good reasons to assume even stronger continuity between different political phases of nation states, as the people living in those usually understood things through the nationalist perspective. What I mean by this is that for example Germany has been Germany for Germans since at least 1870. Not since time immemorial, but once they started to see it as an entity, a nation, it was seem as a continuum regardless of political system.","upvotes":23,"created_utc":1678217888.0}]},{"title":"Was August made the eight month as a reference to the Octavii?","author":"_Despa_2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11m7c4o\/was_august_made_the_eight_month_as_a_reference_to\/","text":"Basically, did Augustus take into account his old name when he made the eighth month his? or did any sources comment on the coincidence?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678307670.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Many infections are self-resolving, which would have been the main option prior to antibiotics, with varying degrees of chronicity and resultant permanent illness and disability. \"Antibiotics\" usually refers to antibacterial drugs in particular, where many infections are caused by viruses that we don't currently treat with antiviral medication routinely as they usually have limited systemic consequences (COVID being an exception to this) - ancient people probably got colds in the winter like we do now, and got over them fine like we do now.\n\nPrevention of infection plays a large role in lower rates of death from infectious diseases today, mostly because we now have germ theory and resultant concepts of hygiene\/sanitation\/antisepsis\/PPE. Vaccination also prevents\/ed a lot of deadly infectious diseases which we still can't necessarily treat specifically (e.g. smallpox, polio, diptheria, measles).\n\nInfectious diseases are an incredibly broad category and how well they can self-resolve depends on (1) the host (underlying health, previous immunity, age, nutrition etc.), (2) the pathogen (inherent pathogenicity and infectivity), and (3) the interaction between them (exposure\/intake, body site affected, varying degrees of inflammation, systemic spread, and other specific effects). All of these things would have varied historically but I imagine host factors and exposure would be the most different to today.\n\nHealthy people in modern, high-income countries usually don't develop systemic bacterial infections. A compromised host (malnourished, environmental exposure, chronically ill, very old or very young) is more likely to have a bacterial infection spread from a localised one to a systemic one, which is probably going to be fatal without antibiotics. Under modern circumstances this mostly happens to elderly people, e.g. bacterial pneumonia; and in babies\/young children more often than young adults, e.g. neonatal sepsis, pertussis, osteomyelitis, meningococcal sepsis. Viral illnesses are the same, although we still can't treat them with antibiotics now - flu and RSV were probably around historically (bad for babies and elderly now too but at least we have ventilators). Depending on the circumstances of historical people it probably would have been fairly similar for them - the very young and very old being most vulnerable.\n\nIn particular, you mention UTIs and ear infections - uncomplicated UTIs often clear without antibiotics. Ear infections in modern, high-income countries are usually viral and antibiotics do not help treatment. But say a malnourished medieval peasant child develops recurrent UTIs due to an (undiagnosed, untreatable) anatomical difference - this child will have greater exposure to repeated infections and will be immunocompromised from malnutrition, so they are much more likely to have the infection spread to the kidneys and then the blood, causing sepsis and death. Or imagine they live in a crowded, single-room house sharing with many family members and animals, with a poorly ventilated wood or peat hearth - this would cause increased exposure to bacteria, on a background of underlying upper airway irritation and immunocompromise, increasing the chance of bacterial ear infections which may self-resolve, or may break its way out through the eardrum before resolving, or over time may result in sufficient acute or chronic inflammation to cause long-term hearing loss, or have invasion of the surrounding bone and brain, systemic spread, sepsis, death etc.\n\nAside from self-resolution and limited use of antimicrobials as mentioned by u\/Aedrian87, the other option prior to antibiotics would have been surgery - most useful for skin and wound infections: debridement or cautery of wounds, lancing\/draining abscesses, and amputation of affected body parts are some options off the top of my head. Leeches and maggots provide a kind of debridement although I'm not sure where\/when they were actually used.\n\nSawbones is a podcast about medical history which covers this topic in a few different episodes.","upvotes":51,"created_utc":1678282067.0},{"author":"Aedrian87","text":"I can't speak for all civilizations, but I can speak about ancient Egypt.\n\nThere are many remedies that are still used today that come from Ancient Egypt, such as the antibiotic properties of copper and honey.

For instance, the Irish military intelligence service, G2, regularly shared information on movement of Axis ships and subs; the Allies were given air corridor access. When the Germans attacked Belfast in Northern Ireland (the Belfast Blitz) the fire brigade response included numerous people from Ireland. The Germans made a (failed) attempt to work with the IRA to provoke an attack on Britain.\n\nBut only lightly shaded quote marks; de Valera did carefully maintain official neutral status (up to and including sending condolences on the death of Hitler), and arguably some of the above considerations were meant to appease the British to prevent their own invasion. Churchill even made reference in a VE Day speech to \"restraint and poise\" in regard to Irish neutrality. de Valera responded:\n\n>Mr. Churchill makes it clear that in certain circumstances he would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his action by Britain's necessity.\n\nStill, coming off WWII, Ireland was not necessarily hell-bent on neutrality, and when presented the option, the Catholic Church, the military, and intellectuals tended to support joining the alliance. \n\nThere were essentially two opportunities. (Importantly, both were after the\nFebruary 1948 election where Fianna F\u00e1il lost the majority, and the reins of\nMinister for External Affairs were handed to Se\u00e1n MacBride.) In 1949 the United States \nformally invited the Irish to sign, and the response, given on the 7th of January, was\n\n>...any military alliance which, or commitment involving military action jointly with, the\nstate that is responsible for the unnatural division of Ireland, which occupies a portion of\nour country with its armed forces, and which supports undemocratic institutions in the north-eastern\ncorner of Ireland, would be entirely repugnant and unacceptable to the Irish people.\n\nor put more simply, to quote the State Department official Ted Achilles: \"They replied that\nthey would be delighted to join provided we could get the British to give back the\nsix Northern counties.\" There was the true sense that perhaps the United States \nmight be able to strongarm such a deal, but the US's response was quite clear it \nwould not be able to negotiate such a condition without Britain's assent, which \nthey most definitely did not have.\n\nNATO was signed later that year without Ireland attached.\n\nA 1950 letter from George Garrett (Ambassador to Ireland) expressed the notion that while he\nhad been specifically instructed not to pressure the Irish on the topic of NATO, he noted\nthat there was concern amongst the military of \"the lack of defense\" in Ireland and\nthe general desire for \"early alarm systems, anti-aircraft guns and tanks\".\n\nThe world had changed between the refusal of January 1949 and 1950: the\nSoviet Union had successfully tested an atomic bomb in August of '49.\nThe US did, following some internal debate, make a new statement\nkeeping the door of invitation open to the Irish; MacBride\nvisited the US in 1951 and re-iterated (to Dean Acheson) that regarding Partition \"he did not\nthink, by itself, the United Kingdom would do anything about it\" but that\nthe US intervention would help. He at least was somewhat of a realist, acknowledging\nAcheson's response that \"this was a very difficult problem\".\n\nDespite the very public notice that Northern Ireland was too much an issue for joining NATO\nthere is still some controversy amongst historians on the depth of the rift (for example, how much of the response was due to Irish policy vs. MacBride's personal thoughts on the matter) but after 1950 the idea of NATO membership was essentially dead. As said by Se\u00e1n Lemass at a meeting in Brussels when Ireland applied for European Economic Community membership in 1962:\n\n>While Ireland did not accede to the North Atlantic Treaty, we have always agreed with the general aim of that Treaty. The fact that we did not accede to it was due to special circumstances and does not qualify in any way our acceptance of the ideal of European unity.\n\n...\n\n\nCottey, A.

Is there a kernel of truth to it? Yes, there is. To handle the German invasion, Russia needed *an* industrialization, but it doesn't mean that the industrialization had to happen in the manned it did under Stalin.\n\nFirst of all, when we talk about industrialization Gulag is not the biggest issue. It helped in several projects, but it was not so instruments. Collectivization of Soviet agriculture (started in 1929, peaked in the early 1930s with a severe famine in grain-producing regions) is the most crucial and most consequential of early Stalin's policies. In order to finance the grandiose affair that was the industrialization, Stalin had to extract as much cash from the country as possible. So, grain had to be exported to the West in exchange for currency that was to be used to buy the equipment and materials in the West. In the early 1930s, the USSR was one of the largest clients of American and German industrialists. To keep up with the Stalin's appetite for industries, the local party cadres squeezed the last grain of wheat out of starving regions. \n\nSo, why was Stalin so fixated on building factories? Most of it had to do with the needs of the Red Army. Stalin wanted complex manufacturing networks that would produce state-of-the-art tanks, battleships, and airplane. The first two five-year plans were tailored to build a firm skeleton of heavy industries to fit the military doctrine of the time. Separate tank brigades, consisting of thousands of modern tanks, were to break through enemy's defence lines and wreak havoc with its supply lines forcing it to surrender (Blitzkrieg was not just a German thing, avoiding the war of attrition at all costs was the main takeaway for every army after WWI). In reality, designing all industries to fit a contemporary military doctrine was a terrible idea in terms of resiliency. If the war were to take slightly longer than expected, the economy would be unable to adjust in time. \n\nThe quality of industrialization was also rather questionable. Factory complexes and equipment, being designed and produced my Americans or Germans, were of great quality, but they were placed on a very poor foundation. Soviet rail lines did not see a systematic modernization since before WWI (and will not see it until the late 1950s). Paved intercity roads were basically non-existent. Site research was rushed to meet the deadlines resulting in many poor decisions. Most infamously, Magnitogorsk and its massive steel mill was built in the middle of the Ural forest next to an apparent large deposit of iron ore. The deposit happened to be insufficient and the mill started importing the ore in order to make use of the gargantuan facility. Another big issue was lack of engineers, many of whom were forced out of profession or country altogether by earlier Soviet policies. Meanwhile, Soviet higher education was incapable of producing enough qualified specialists due to shortsighted egalitarian education reforms undertaken by Lenin. Soviet workers were also poorly motivated and had little experience with complex machinery. \n\nSo, how did it all work after all? Soviet military strategy failed, tank brigades were destroyed in the first few weeks or were simply abandoned after fragile supply lines collapsed, and a key industrial region around the Dnepr river was overrun by Germans by fall. First of all, Soviet Union could cut down on civilian consumption even more than it did before the war, something inconceivable in less totalitarian states (even Germany's *Guns and Butter* policy lasted for about four years of WWII). Soviet Union evacuated many of its pivotal industries to the east and rebuilt factories there. Oftentimes, prioritizing industrial cargo meant leaving vulnerable civilian populations at the mercy of advancing Germans. However, the most important factor was Allied support. \n\nIn terms of military equipment, Lend-Lease does not seem so crucial. Soviet Union produced its tanks, rifles, and airplanes. But if we compare the number of produced trucks, locomotives, the volume of high-octane airplane fuel, food supply (UkSSR was a key agricultural region) and other key components for waging a long war of attrition, we can clearly see the shortcoming of Stalin's industrialization. The military-industrial complex created when millions in the Soviet Russia and Ukraine starved to death was by itself a formidable force designed to execute one task. Once it failed to do so, thousands more had to die for it to be rebuilt in Siberian forests which by itself was only possible because Western Allied were able to make up for any shortcomings of Soviet economy being completely dedicated to the war effort.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1678306283.0},{"author":"passabagi","text":"I guess you could draw a denarcation line between Stalin, and 'Stalin's economic policy'. I don't know how you would distinguish, in broad strokes, Stalin's economic policy from the policy of the USSR before he secured absolute control, or even, the policies of the Tsar, especially under Pyotr Stolepin.\n\nThe basic thrust of all these polices, some muddling around under the Tsar notwithstanding, is massive and rapid modernization. \n\nFurther, within this broad framework, Stalin's economic policies were rather subject to change. Stalin publicly supported[0] the NEP (essentially economic liberalization) in the 20's, supported a moderate (Bukarinite) economic policy in the mid 20's, then transitioned to a radically centralized economic policy at the beginning of the 30's (which in the 20's, had been Trotsky's position). Most people tend to think this is just a lot of political opportunism on Stalin's part, but the basic terms of the discussion are neither established by Stalin nor even the Bolsheviks: Russia had to modernize as rapidly as possible, to fend off the threat from the west. \n\nIf you look at the longue dur\u00e9e of Russian history, this makes Stalin's economic policy very much a continuation of the most strongest traditions of Russian statehood: ever since Peter the Great, Russian elites have tried to modernize Russia, to fend off invasion from a more economically productive, technologically advanced, and aggressively expansionist West. \n\nFor the record, it's hard to answer a counterfactual, but I think it's basically certain that the USSR would not have survived WW2 without the rapid modernization programs of the USSR, although I'm far less certain that Stalin was a necessary cog in that particular machine. \n\nThe city of Magnitogorsk was supposedly responsible for about *half* of the Soviet steel production in WW2, and this city literally didn't exist before the USSR. Even very skeptical western economists put the growth rates during the 5-year plan at somewhere between 10 and 16 percent per-anum[1]. Steel output increased like five-fold across the whole USSR.[2]\n\nNow, I think it's pretty safe to say that if you took away half of the industrial base of the USSR, it would not have survived WW2. If you took away four fifths? Absolutely not a hope in hell.\n\n[0]: although he might have had some doubts: \"The Transition from War Communism to the New Economic Policy: An Analysis of Stalin's Views\" by Robert Himmer in Russian Review gives a sort of argument that he was in fact, privately against it. \n\n[1]: Stephen Kotkin's Magnetic Mountain, even though he throws some shade on the validity of straight quantitative approaches to judging industrial output. On the other hand, he's sort of hinging his argument on the idea that the USSR was producing a lot of junk and calling it output, which is probably true, but the important context is *that's what everybody is doing*. \n\n[2]: The Development of the Russian Iron and Steel Works, J.E Rowe.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678310106.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678260707.0}]},{"title":"Why didn\u2019t European powers colonise central\/Eastern Europe?","author":"fap_fappington1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11m7vd2\/why_didnt_european_powers_colonise_centraleastern\/","text":"At the end of world war 1, allied powers took possession of former ottoman lands.

De Mahieu was a [literal WWII Nazi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jacques_de_Mahieu) who escaped to Argentina and later headed a neo-Nazi chapter, which pretty much invalidates everything he's ever said about anything. This was just one of his many \"Aryans did everything important ever\" theories.\n\nThe \"evidence\" is correspondingly easy to debunk though, so let's have a go at it. I'm basing this on the parts presented [here](https:\/\/snr.org.uk\/snr-forum\/topic\/the-danish-viking-presence-in-south-america-1000-c-1250\/), since I'm not too keen to on reading entire books by Nazis. I'll respond to each based on the number.\n\n1) Ancient Peruvian dogs did not come from Europe. The only evidence here is skeletal analysis from the 1880s which, given the difficulty of really differentiating dog breeds from morphology and the scale of the claim, is hardly appropriate. More importantly, [genetic analysis](https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.1076980) of canines from archaeological sites in South America places them all nicely in the same clade that migrated with humans across the Bering Strait thousands and thousands of years ago.\n\n2) Nazis dug a tunnel into a mountain and found an enormous impenetrable... *something*?? There's various versions of this reprinted across the internet, and they don't all line up on the details. There's a detail about a \"great white king\" buried there, with the source being \"a Nazi said a guy said he heard it from his father who heard it from his father.\" None of the people or organizations involved in this appear anywhere else on the internet, and there are no images (even illustrations!) of the supposed find.\n\n3) Starts with a classic \"indigenous people couldn't have done this\" (why? who knows!) and continues with the old reliable \"Tiwananku was built by anyone but the locals.\" I've worked at Tiwanaku for the past ten years and written a good bit about it [on this sub](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/profiles\/commodorecoco); the main reason it's got such a reputation is that its monument weren't as buried as other sites'. Heck, even de Mahieu's [book on it](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/39537236\/EL_IMPERIO_VIKINGO_DE_TIAHUANACU_Jacques_de_Mahieu) isn't all that concerned with the site. Anyways... this is where the site names come in. De Mahieu got his names from Dutch maps made in the 1620s and '30s. He claims they were copies of Jesuit originals and that the appearance of the same toponyms in early chronicles verifies their accuracy. This is [quite unlikely](https:\/\/revistas.unisinos.br\/index.php\/historia\/article\/view\/htu.2015.191.05). Rather, it seems that they were creative interpretations of the chronicles themselves. Of the many similar maps from this era, only one (the one not reference by de Mahieu) cites its sources, and its entirely the text chronicles- no Jesuit maps. One of these sources, Ulrich Schmidl, was a Bavarian who traveled to South America and committed some egregious German-ification of the spellings: places called Quiloazas and Mecoretais in Spanish texts became Gulgeissen in Machueradeiss in Schmidl's German. Now, the places in question weren't butchered in quite the same way; Tocanguzir in Schmidl's text is Tocangucir in Cabeza de Vaca's. Yet the similarity with the Norse remains poor. *Toga* is the genitive plural of the word for [rope](https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/tog#Old_Norse); the nominative plural of *h\u00fas*, which does mean \"house,\" is actually *[husin](https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/h%C3%BAs#Old_Norse)* The \"-huesi\" in Orthuesi might well mean \"house,\" but if so it's because it's cognate with the Quechua *wasi*, \"house, building.\" It's a coincidence that it's spelled similarly to *hus*, given how different they sound. Weibingo? The linked forum claims \"all the earliest Spanish maps\" have it, and yet Schmidl seems to be the only actual mention.\n\n4) This is entirely based on one town that if you spell it weird it ends in \"-heim,\" as in *Jotunheim.* Emphasis on *if*, since that's [not how it's spelled](https:\/\/www.ivinhema.ms.gov.br\/).\n\n5) For once, their really is a lot of rock art in the caves in Amambay!

Simon Henoschberg, a student of Piketty, also [published a study about it](http:\/\/piketty.pse.ens.fr\/files\/Henochsberg2016.pdf). The graph of the debt service between 1840 and 1915 by Bulmer-Thomas is [here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/kb3fo7A). We can see that the % of external debt service was about 50% between 1840 and 1850, and decreased to 15-20% after that. The \"double debt\" - the original debt of 150 million fr (renegotiated down to 90 millions in 1838) and the 30 million fr loan contracted in Paris - was paid off in 1883, but the actual end of the debt service is fuzzy as Haiti took new loans (some of them fraudulent) to service it in 1874, 1875, 1896 and 1910, so the part of the external debt service grew again. \n\nNote the presence of external claims made by foreigners after allegations of property damage, breach of contract or false arrests (some true, some inflated, some frivolous). The part of the budget dedicated to the military was always high, absorbing as much as 50% in the first two decades of the Republic, though it stabilized around 25-30% from the 1840s onward.\n\nHere are some of Bulmer-Thomas's notes about the graph above.\n\n>**1825\u20137**. [...] The first instalment of this indemnity (30 million francs) was met mainly with the proceeds of a French loan. This loan had a face value of 30 million francs, but only 24 million francs was disbursed. [...]. Most of the balance of the loan (6 million francs) was remitted in specie, but there remained a balance (700,000 francs), which was not paid. The dollar value of what was paid in specie (5.3 million francs) was about $1 million, which was more than public revenue for the year. However, it was not paid from the budget, so I have not included anything for 1825. The interest on the 30 million franc loan was paid in 1826\u20137, but not by Haiti. It was paid by the French government to the French bankers and was therefore added in theory to what Haiti owed to France. Haiti therefore paid no debt service in these years, and the loan went into default [...]. \n\n>**1838\u20131883**. The indemnity was renegotiated in 1838 and reduced from 150 million to 90 million francs (of which some 30 million francs had been paid leaving 60 million). The terms on which the indemnity (60 mn), the principal (30 mn) and interest (3%) on the loan and the balance from 1825 (700,000 francs) were to be paid, were all set out clearly in an annual schedule, but the rate of exchange would cause difficulties because the debt had to be paid in francs. For domestic reasons (political upheaval in Haiti), payments were suspended in 1843\u20138 and 1867\u20139 (but two small payments were made in the latter years). In theory, this pushed back the final payment from 1868 to 1876. However, for various reasons, the final payment was not made until December 1883. [...]\n\n>**1874\u20131915**. It is first necessary to estimate the external debt service on new loans only (contracted in 1874, 1875, 1896 and 1910). Apart from the first loan, which was intended to pay off the double debt, each new loan was intended \u2013 among other things \u2013 to pay off the previous loan. This did not happen primarily because Haiti was cheated of the funds due through excessive commissions. The 1875 loan was particularly scandalous, and the amount repayable was scaled down in the 1880s. Nevertheless, Haiti had to repay far more than it had received (even when interest is excluded). \n\n**Sources**\n\n* Bulmer-Thomas, Victor.

The idea that the Jamestown and Plymouth settlers had any sense of either political ideology deployed in this line of argumentation is blatantly false. These are seventeenth century people looking to set up some kind of agrarian settlement in unfamiliar territory; not contemporary Western voters of the information age versed even superficially in the internal debates of political economy (it wasn't even a full fledged discipline at the time).   \n\n\nTo answer meat of the question, I will adopt the implicit premises of your question and use socialism to denote collective ownership characteristics, and capitalism to denote private ownership characteristics. I am not endorsing these oversimplified definitions, but will use them as placeholders for the purposes of getting through your query as framed. \n\nJamestown was first founded by the Virginia Company of London (VCL or London Company) in 1607 as James Fort. It was briefly abandoned in 1610 due to typical challenges posed by early settlement in North America, but effectively became the colonial capital for the VCL by 1616. Property and resource ownership in the legal sense were administered via the charter of the VCL which was a legal compact between the VCL, the British Crown and its investors. The land that the company would use to extract resources, the resource outputs and even the indentured workers who worked it were all on the private property spectrum as far as economic polemics were concerned. The duty of the company was to pay a portion of its profits to investors, much like the way a dividend stock works today. As far as legality was concerned, this was a private enterprise and run as such. It owned land and wanted to extract its resources. Land was paid out to workers who survived their contracts, effectively making the land an asset, further adding capitalist flavour to the endeavour. By 1619, we see the arrival of slaves to contribute to the labour force being put to work on the most profitable land owned by investors. To frame any period of this history as socialist is laughable. This is a privately run industry with the main decisionmaking made by individuals in the employ of a stock company. It is not a comune in any sense. Jamestown was run by a business for business purposes and evolved as a settlement from those roots. \n\nPlymouth has similar roots. The difference here is that the Puritans who founded the colony did so to repay a debt instead of turn a profit at the outset. It is also arguable that the motivations here were different since the Puritans were indeed fleeing religious persecution at the hands of Tobias Matthew. However, the core economic mechanics of this endeavour were also characteristically capitalist in the sense that this enterprise was run on private property principles. The Puritan congregation purchased a patent from the Plymouth Company which was the same sort of institution as the VCL: a private charter company funded by stock investors. To earn the patent, the Puritans obtained financing from a group known as the Merchant Adventurers which is best described as an investors guild. To repay that financing, it was expected that Plymouth become a profitable colony in a similar way to all other charter colonial charter companies of the period. Since this was financed rather than explicitly founded by a company, the Puritans had a little more wiggle room in terms of how they organized their settlement. They were led by a system of governorship that was not overtly tied to company choice and were capable of codifying their own laws using a blend of English common law and the Bible. It is difficult to gauge how economic life was organized in the early years of the colony, but by 1627 we see the emergence of grazing rights and property boundaries highlighting the division of Plymouth settlement lands into private (i.e., capitalist) property lots forming the basis of a firmly capitalist oriented community where private property is the base (some historians argue this correlates the arrival of cattle and other livestock that relies on grazing). The fur trade was initially the most profitable export the colony had to repay its debt to the Adventurers. Agriculture and fishing provided a local trade network with other colonial settlements and Indigenous communities which arguably helped support other settlements within the regional network, Jamestown included. Commerce being capitalism's close family member helped ensure the viability of the venture and reinforced the private property dynamics that were taking root.   \n\n\nThe point here is that at no point in these stories is there any ever 'socialist' or collective ownership intentions in either of these endeavours. Jamestown was  a 'company colony' and run with profiteering in mind. Plymouth needed to be profitable by circumstance to pay down a debt owed to a company that made the endeavour possible. Private property and finance were integral to the development of these settlements, and any sense that these were collective ownership endeavours is fundamentally flawed on that basis alone. It is important to note that the early years of both these settlements suffers from a documentary gap, so while the possibility of collective ownership as mitigation strategies is possible, this would still ignore the capitalist core of these colonial projects. \n\nSources: \n\n* \"An Indian to help in the work: The Importance of Indian Labor in the New England Economy,\" in Brethren by Nature, ed.

Jamestown is a swamp. It's brackish, it's humid, the ground is full of salt, and the soil is mostly clay and sand. You can't drink the water and it isn't easily made into salt. They didn't bring farmers or fishermen, they expected to do things like mine for gold and produce glass. The land wasn't farmable and it was in the middle of a burgeoning native empire. They had also arrived in a period of horrible weather - the early 1600s were a severe drought for the area, so it was hot and unpleasant in the summer when they arrived. It's dangerous to work outside in the summer if you're not eating well and have bad water - heat stroke and food poisoning must have been common. The winters are surprisingly cold near the shores of the rivers, with biting winds, and that was an unseasonably cold period. The region was rich with fish, but without boats, energy, or local knowledge they couldn't fish. \n\nMore than 100 people lives at james colony in 1607 when the ships left to fetch the first supply mission. When the supply ships arrived, about 40 remained. The supply ship boosted that population to almost 200, and over winter 1608 dozens of colonists again died. By 1609, the colony is starving and more and more colonists keep arriving, expecting a sustainable colony. 500 men, women, and children lived there in autumn 1609, 69 survived to spring 1610. It took a huge influx of men in 1610-1612 to bring the weapons, supplies, and ships to fish, farm, and fight for food supplies. Every stage of the colony was marred by incompetent leadership, attempts to produce valuable goods like glass and gold, and terrible communication. \n\nWe know at least one person was eaten during this time period, probably around 1610. \n\nEconomically, Jamestown was a private enterprise designed to extract wealth. Realistically, it was a deadly scam. Insofar as we want to assign a economic label to it, the best one we can is \"imperialist pyramid scheme\". Every supply run brought hundreds of people promised that the farming was effective, the colony would be rich soon, and they should come now. Then those people would invest, bring food, and arrive at a starving colony where they would be put to work trying to survive while the leadership sailed off to get more food and supplies. The success of the colony came from a cash crop, but it also came from winning a war with the natives, government investment, and the deaths of over 500 colonists. \n\nSources: \n\nI live in williamsburg and this area was completely uninhabitable to those colonists - it's shitty to farm, shitty to live in, and super swampy.

Its destiny is to expand into a red giant after it runs out of hydrogen in its core to produce energy (after running out of hydrogen, helium fusion will produce energy, which will result in higher temperatures in the core, which will result in the expansion). The sun's atmosphere will then extend past the Earth's orbit, and the Earth will become red hot - if we are still here on Earth, we will be most thoroughly cooked.\n\nHowever, as soon as the conservation of energy was discovered in the mid-19th century, it was scientifically evident that the sun would run out of energy, leading to the end of the world (through freezing, if nothing else).\n\nNew science of the sun after that essentially extended what we thought the life of the sun would be. See my recent answer in\n\n* https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/10za7i5\/how_did_scientists_think_the_sun_worked_prior_to\/\n\nfor the progression from meteor impacts to gravitational contraction to nuclear fusion and how these affected our estimates of the life of the sun. With the sun eventually running out of energy, that's the end of the world, with or without expansion into a red giant, with or without a supernova.\n\nYou are correct to say that it doesn't appear to have had a large impact on popular culture. There is some science fiction, including pessimistic, semi-pessimistic, and hopeful, focussing on the end of the world in the distant future (Arthur C. Clarke's \"Against the Fall of Night\" is a well-known example). Some deals with the expected (at the time) \"heat death\" of the world (or, indeed, the universe as a whole) - death through freezing. Some deals with more explosive death. But this is literature on the fringes of popular culture.\n\nThe lack of wider impact is at least partly due to two reasons:\n\n1. People don't care much about what might happen in 100-200 million generations from now. Inaction and slow action on other environment issues (e.g., climate change) suggests that even 100-200 generations is well beyond how far many people care, and we're talking about a millions times longer than that.\n\n2. Many people - notably religious people - didn't expect the Earth to endure forever, even before it was clear that the sun had a finite lifetime. If one's religion teaches that the Earth is only some thousands of years old, and we expect it to end in a few generations at the most (even in their lifetime), science that says that the world might end in billions of years is meaningless.","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1678318418.0}]},{"title":"Why did postwar US governments allow land reform in occupied Japan but in many ways suppress it in the Philippines?","author":"raori921","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11luuy8\/why_did_postwar_us_governments_allow_land_reform\/","text":"Sometimes I see this assertion made that the US occupiers, after WW2, were supportive of land reform\/redistribution in Japan, taking the land and even sometimes power of the landholding\/industrial elites up to WW2 and redistributing them to smaller farmers, owners, families, etc.\n\nBut the same Americans seem to be content with doing the *opposite* in the Philippines: **they allowed the big landholding elites there to keep their land and wealth**.

This shields a lot of organs-- stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,   small intestine, top of the transverse and descending colon,  top of kidneys.\n\nThe diaphragm also extends back into the boundary of this area (it separates the abdominal cavity from the chest.)   If you've heard of \"the solar plexus\",  that's a name for a network of nerves more accurately called the Celiac plexus which is subdivided into smaller plexuses connected to stomach, spleen, pancreas, above the kidneys.\n\nSo, upper abdominal pain in that area is very nonspecific and can be caused by  issues in a lot of organs.  As such, finding the cause of such pain without any other symptoms can be very hard even with modern tests.  We're only beginning to understand functional disorders like IBS, etc.\n\nUntil the early 18th century, \"Hypochrondiac\" just referred to this area, which was thought to be the seat of melancholy (one of the four humors-- \"black bile.\")  It wasn't until the late 18th century when it came to be applied to people overly afraid of being ill and misinterpreting symptoms.\n\nSo to frame the mindset of recent centuries to today, people coming in and complaining of hypochrondiac type pain but with nothing obviously wrong were often thought to be suffering from emotional issues (a throwback to melancholy.)  Even peptic ulcers were thought to be caused by anxiety and stress before a scientist identified *Heliciobacter pylori.*\n\n\\----\n\nSo what kind of \"hypochondriac\" your monk is matters.  Is he suffering from fluctuating, undiagnosable chronic ailments which makes him querulous and hypersensitive to anything that might spoil his health?\n\nMedieval maladies are not a short list: gout, peptic ulcer, gallstones, chronic malaria, as well as post-illness syndromes, infection, autoimmune illness (celiac is an easy one!)  all might let him suffer for years without hitting a crisis point.\n\nHe wouldn't worry about germs, since these didn't exist in Medieval medicine.\n\n Monasteries often served as hospitals and Monks would copy out the texts of Galen and Hippocrates.  Bloodletting would be done to balance the humors (sanguine or choleric),  herbs would be given, basic first-aid and nursing the ill with poultices, bandages, salves, as well as heavy praying.  They also had soaps, and while too much washing was thought to be bad, regular washing was common to remove sweat and prevent skin conditions and parasites, and washing face and hands on a daily basis was urged by medical writings then.\n\nThey'd clean teeth with cloth and pastes made from crushed herbs.\n\nSo your monk might be pretty good at basic medicine himself and have nursed the ill.\n\nHis first concern would be his symptom control and his humoral balance (phlegm, melancholy, choler, and sanguine.)  Depending on what kind of humoral imbalance he would worry about re his dyscrasia, he would make or take the folk remedies and activities to correct these humors.   The humoral theory is based on Greek medicine texts--  Hippocrates applied it to medicine.  Galen followed Hippocrates on the humor theory, and Galen was quite influential in the Middle Ages.\n\nAvicenna's \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025 mentioned the humoral model, and hot\/cold\/moist\/dry temperaments too.  His books became standard in medieval universities across Europe.\n\nWould it be \"morbid melancholy\" with any of this: dry skin, mood swings, listlessness, gloom, (i.e. symptoms of depression?)  He would have to avoid sour foods and eat sanguine  foods such as red meat and would be warmed up.  Black bile was associated with cancer & the spleen.  Sometimes enemas would be prescribed to rid the body of black bile. (which isn't found the body in pure form-- doesn't really exist. But it was thought to make skin, stools, and blood black, so probably old, clotted blood?) \n\nOr would it be explosion of anger (excess choler) from pain attacks? Any yellow pallor, fevers? He'd be advised to avoid salty or bitter foods (and grilled meats) and eat less flavorful, watery foods, raw veggies, etc.  Choler (yellow bile) was linked with rheumatism.  Vomiting might bring it out.\n\nSlowness, coldness, calm, lack of emotion, fatigue (excess phlegm)? Avoid watery foods (cucumbers, lettuce, fish) and eat salty, pungent and bitter foods  like onions, garlic, capers, olives.  A rub with blistering agents to produce weeping might be used to release excess phlegm.\n\nExcess cheer, amorousness, recklessness (too much blood or sanguine?) -- bloodletting would be the remedy for this. Any red inflammation could be regarded as excess blood.  Chilling was a common remedy.\n\nYour monk also might try various folk remedies he grew up with.  He might apply poultices, inhale vapors or herbal smoke, drink herbal teas.  Some common medications for stomach problems in Middle Ages were wormwood, mint, and balm.  For chesty coughs and colds, horehound candy (I had these as a kid),  plus mustard-based chest plasters possibly.  However in doing so, would he risk his soul by seeing a folk healer or trying magic for his health?\n\nShouldn't he trust in God and pray for healing?  (I'm not saying he couldn't do both.)  And in fact this was common.\n\nIf what triggered this fear of illness is more psychological-- what was that trigger?  Did he get very ill, and have PTSD and weakness after?  Is he fearful of demons possessing him to cause illness (a viewpoint backed in the bible) and so sees all illness as a demon he must exorcise?  Does he nurse the sick himself?\n\nIs his acute anxiety possibly a manifestation of guilt (PTSD often links to feelings of guilt), and if so, is he going to do extreme measures to repent?  Not bathe, whip himself, wear hair shirts, or what?  Is he sworn to poverty or a wealthy nobleman who dabbles in physicians and exotic cures?\n\nMany nuns and priests died young, before age 30. It was just the times-- bad water, bad and scanty food, cold buildings, ascetic living,  plus hard work including care of the sick and dying. No antibiotics. People could go suddenly from infection and it was God's will.  Suffering also could be seen as a tribulation, a cross to bear.\n\nBut religion aside, I could see being afraid of getting leprosy after caring for lepers. That was a life of being outcast as your body fell apart.  In such a case, he might not be able to stay a priest  (a monk might stay, but might be shunned, depending on his cloister's mission and concerns.)\n\nThink of some concrete symptoms or causes for the hypochondria, what he complains of, then find what cures\/specific behavior he would try to \"fix it\" (and failure to do so reliably, leading to superstitious fear and anxiety), will follow.\n\nAlso consider the attitude of his community to a monk whom God failed to heal after much prayer and work.  So would he air it to the community, and if so, who needed to know? Don't do abstract. Think specific.\n\nImagine somebody with celiac disease (not known until the 1970s as an autoimmune disease!) not being able to stand bread, ale or the Eucharist-- all common in that area!   Or somebody who had survived ergotism (St. Anthony's fire)  and hallucinated fighting with the devil (rye itself does have gluten, as well.) and avoided all bread.  Celiac disease wasn't identified as an autoimmune disease until 1970 but it's been around a long time and can occur in about any population with gluten in their diet.\n\nThe Irish and the Scottish historically had a low-gluten diet (oatmeal, then potatoes.) as the island was too damp to grow wheat and wheat flour was  a expensive luxury.   (Scotland did grow barley, so did Wales, but oats were also common in Wales.)\n\nDiets tended to be quite local in the Middle Ages, with markets drawing people from dozens of miles around, tops.  So one location might not grow wheat, barley, or rye crops, yet another location within a day or two's drive could rely heavily on that.\n\nIn much of Europe, the wheat (and other grain crops) harvest would be around Lammas (\"Loaf-mass\") on August 1st.  Many peasants would be starving until it came in.  So gluten exposure  could be worst in autumn and improve maybe by Lent.  I mean, unless it was an order that did a beer fast!   (Fortunately that's only recorded for the 17th century.  [https:\/\/www.catholicnewsagency.com\/news\/35537\/these-17th-century-monks-did-a-beer-fast-for-lent](https:\/\/www.catholicnewsagency.com\/news\/35537\/these-17th-century-monks-did-a-beer-fast-for-lent) )\n\nBut beer soup for breakfast was a thing in medieval Germany, so... there are records of medieval monks complaining of gout, which they really didn't associate with the alcohol they were drinking.\n\nGout itself comes from \"gutta\"-- a drop, basically on the idea that humors slowed down and dripped into the joints causing pain.  (Actually, as gout comes from excess uric acid not urinated out but instead crystallizing in joints, this is kind of close.)\n\nThe market economy wasn't geared to have a lot of long-distance food transport except for expensive luxury foods like wine. And monks and priests ate what was provided by others.  Porridges\/gruel might be peas, oatmeal, barley, or wheat.  So avoiding food might be hard (avoiding drink would be easier, I suspect, but rarer.)\n\nGood luck figuring out which of many approaches you want to take, and where and when in the Middle Ages you're thinking of, then build from there!","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678602471.0}]},{"title":"Islam encouraged its believers to read\/recite Koran.

Most countries in which the residential power is at 100-127V use the US-style plug (type A plug), and most countries in which the residential power is 220-240V use the European-style plug (type C AKA Europlug). The main exception to this are countries in Oceania using the Australian-style angled-pin plug (Type I), which is also used in China. This is a very useful choice in terms of safety: an appliance designed to run on 110V will have a type A plug, and a user can't plug it into a type C or type I 220-240V socket. This can save the appliance from catastrophic damage, and also the user from risks such as house fires and electric shock resulting from such catastrophic damage to the appliance. Today, automatic-switching power supplies (which can detect the supply voltage and switch automatically to run on either 100-120V or 220-240V) are fairly common, especially in items such as laptop chargers, but many appliances still assume a particular supply voltage. For world-wide overview of the overlap between 100-120V domestic supply and US-style type A plugs, compare the following two maps:\n\n* https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:World_Map_of_Mains_Voltages_and_Frequencies,_Detailed.svg\n\n* https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:World_map_of_electrical_mains_power_plug_types_used.svg\n\nTaiwan and Japan use 110V and 100V respectively, and thus use the \"standard\" 100-120V plug, the American-style Type A. South Korea uses 220V, and the type C Europlug.\n\nMore generally, in many countries, early electrification was carried by multiple companies, which often chose different supply voltages and frequencies (or, in the very early history of commercial electricity general, DC or AC). As electricity became more widely used, there were attempts to impose uniform standards within countries, and today it is usual for domestic electricity supply to be at a single voltage throughout the country. Often, the most common voltage in use in the country was chosen as the standard. This is one reason why some countries use different supply voltages: different systems were in use by the leading electricity suppliers in those countries, and different voltages were therefore chosen as the national standard. For example, the Nationalist government in China began efforts to form a uniform electrical supply system in 1928. 200V was chosen as the residential supply standard, and efforts were made to switch to 50Hz as the supply frequency (50Hz was used by 69% of the industry in 1928, and 3 years later this had risen to 83%). (Why different frequencies? In Japan, both 50Hz and 60Hz were in use (and are still in use) because Tokyo Electric Light bought German generators, which operated at 50Hz, and Osaka Electric Lamp bought US generators at 60Hz.) Thus, largely due to the luck of the early electricity generating companies in China and Japan, China chose 200V and Japan 100V (China later switched to 220V, while Japan is still at 100V). Since Taiwan was under Japanese control, it is unsurprising to see Taiwan at 110V, close to the Japanese standard.\n\nKorea initially used 100V as their standard, being, like Taiwan, under Japanese control. In the 1960s, a switch to 220V was planned (and with Korean nationalism of the time being what it was, part of this might have been motivated simply by wanting to change from the Japanese standard, in addition to the technical advantages of 220V (higher power without excessive currents)). Implementation of this began in 1973, and was eventually completed in 2005. Why was Korea able to make this change? The level of domestic electricity use other than for lighting was very low in the 1960s, with under 10% of households owning a television, and under 0.1% an electric washing machine. Thus, consumer resistance to the change was relatively low (since few consumers would find their old appliances becoming unusable). An interesting coincidence is that the first electricity generator in Korea, before the Japanese takeover, used 220V, with two 110V Edison generators were installed in series to provide 220V.\n\nWith the Korean adoption of 220V came the adoption of the most commonly used 220V plug: the type C Europlug.\n\nWhat of China? China is unusual for using their own unique plugs. For earthed plugs\/sockets, they use a plug similar to the Australian-style type I, but with thinner angled connecters (which makes Chinese plugs a little loose in Australian sockets, and Australian plugs can be difficult to insert into Chinese sockets, and an unearthed (i.e., 2 pin) Australian plug might not work in an earthed Chinese socket if it is designed to only operate if an earth pin is inserted. For unearthed plugs\/sockets, they chose a two-pin plug very similar to the US-style type A. Like the almost-interoperability of Australian and Chinese type I plugs and sockets, the US and Chinese type A plugs and sockets are usable together (as long as the 110V vs 220V is OK due to the use of a switching power supply!). Having different plugs for earthed and unearthed appliances that differ by more than just the presence or absence of an earth connector can be a useful safety feature. I have read that type I and type A plugs were chosen since their connectors are flat, and can be stamped from copper sheet, making manufacture cheaper than for type C Europlugs, but am unable to confirm this with a reliable source. Chinese sockets today often include two sets of holes: one set for an earthed type I plug, and another set for either just a type A plug, or either a type A or type C plug (using both flat and round holes), like number 4 shown here by the Digital Museum of Plugs and Sockets:\n\n* https:\/\/www.plugsocketmuseum.nl\/China1.html","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678358081.0}]},{"title":"In Bronze Age cities, how far did the \"suburban sprawl\" extend outside the walls?

In the article, an archeologist mentioned that inside the city walls were the important buildings like temples, but nearly all the people actually lived outside the walls. I thought that explained how so many huge cities like Babylon have such a small area enclosed by their walls. I also always assumed that large cities must of had miles of farms and pastures to support their populations since, according to Google, even with modern farming techniques you need about 5 acres of land to support one person. So a city like Hattusa with 30,000 people must of had at least a couple hundred square miles of land dedicated to agriculture, and they still would have had to import a lot. And that's to say nothing of Babylon's 100,000+ population. But if that's true, I don't really understand how the walls functioned if most people, and presumably most of their possessions, were not only outside the walls, but not even within visual distance of them. Unless the walls were just to protect the priests, aristocracy, etc.  \n\n\nDid most people live outside the city walls, with at least some people up to several miles outside the city walls (making it impossible to outrun any attacking chariots, etc.), or am I missing something about how these cities kept themselves fed?\n\nIn case of attack, did everyone at least try to hole up behind the walls while their homes outside were ransacked (which seems to defeat the point of having walls), or were the the people in the suburbs left to their own devices?","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678238407.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

It was based upon accounts of Persian travellers who had gone east. The book has only survived through fragments quoted by later authors, and contain a great deal of fanciful tales and straight up bogus, but there is a brief reference to traders coming from \"Seres\", which was  the term later applied to China. I don't feel the confidence to assert that Ctesias was actually referring to Zhou era China with this comment tho. \n\nThe more extensive contacts between China and the West only came later, following Alexander the Great's conquest in Central Asia, and the founding of Greek-derived kingdoms in Asia- IN particular, as you say, these contacts fully mterialized after the voyages of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian under the Emperor Han Wudi in the 2nd century BC, which fully opened the Silk Road, and also led to Chinese contacts with the now acendant Roman Empire. To my knowledge, there are no Chinese geographic accounts of the empires of Western Asia before Zhang Qian. \n\nSo pre-Alexander, the Persian Empire was sort of in the way, and Indica is the only account I'm aware of giving anything remotely describing China in Western history.

The key advantage of chillies for poorer people was that they could easily be grown (given a suitable climate) - the family could grow their own \"hot\" spices rather than buying expensive (especially if imported) spices. At least some writers - from the educated and literate wealthier classes - wrote that chillies were a coarse and crude substitute for \"real\" pepper (usually black pepper, *Piper nigrum*).\n\nThis lower-class adoption has made it difficult to trace the adoption of chillies into local cuisines, since cookbooks were largely for the upper classes, and much food writing focussed on upper class foods. Chillies can be invisible in a country's literature for 100-200 years after their introduction. For example, the chilli was probably introduced to Korea in the 16th century, but is first mentioned in Korean literature in 1613. The early Korean cookbook, *Eumsik dimibang*, written in Korean (in Hangul), by a woman (and presumably for women), in about 1670, makes no use of chillies, and has no mention of them. Similarly, recipes from the kitchens of Shah Jahan in India (r. 1628-1658) use plenty of black pepper, but no chillies.\n\nWhere chillies couldn't be grown, they typically were not adopted into the local cuisine, and where other \"hot\" spices weren't used before the arrival of chillies, chillies were less likely to be adopted.\n\nFurther reading about the spread of chillies:\n\n* Andrews, Jean. *The Pepper Trail: History and Recipes from Around the World*, University of North Texas Press, 1999\n\n* S.

This is particularly well known in the context of the mutiny on the _Bounty_; I wrote about this in [an earlier answer,](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/6ig3dg\/in_reality_was_captain_bligh_really_such_a_cruel\/) part of which I'll reproduce below: \n\n> When the Bounty actually made it to Tahiti, discipline was again severely relaxed. (This yo-yoing between relaxed and severe discipline did severe damage to the ordinary social contract on board.) The men lived openly with Tahitian women ashore, traded with them for breadfruits, and (perhaps unsurprisingly) either stole or allowed to be stolen items from the ship (particularly iron items) that could be exchanged for food, souvenirs or sexual favors. Bligh was enraged by this and publicly berated his officers (including Christian) in front of both their sailors and the Tahitians, further undermining his own authority; and started to attempt again to enforce harsh discipline, including floggings. When they left Tahiti, morale seems to have been stable, but Bligh had again began to berate the crew and behave unpredictably. When the ship stopped in Nomuka, Bligh put Christian in charge of a watering party but denied him use of the ship's muskets; the inhabitants of Nomuka were unfriendly and prevented Christian from watering, whereupon Bligh cursed him on the deck as a coward -- an insult that would in other contexts have led to a duel among people of equal standing. Bligh went on to accuse Christian of stealing coconuts from his private pantry, and cut the whole crew's rum ration in retaliation. This seems to have been the proverbial last straw for Christian, who seized the ship the next morning and put Bligh in an open boat with 18 men who stayed loyal.

On the other hand, it was a state built for repressing its own population. In their first decade in power, Mugabe's ruling party essentially embraced both aspects of that inheritance. \n\nSo on one hand, they stepped carefully around land reform despite considerable public anger among the majority about the vast percentage of arable land being under the control of a small white minority. The government experimented with cooperatives and other development plans designed to increase African ownership of businesses and farms while not cutting too much into the existing productivity of the agricultural sector--for that first decade and a half, Zimbabwe was a net food exporter within the region, in fact. They also invited new investment from abroad and restrained a lot of the strong rhetoric about nationalization and state socialism that had been the party's stock in trade during the liberation war. \n\nOn the other hand, while the Zimbabwean government did face a serious national security threat from South Africa, it also used the intelligence and policing apparatus built by the Rhodesian state to suppress its main political rival (Joshua Nkomo's political party ZAPU) and eventually to conduct mass killings in the southern part of the country with an army brigade that had received additional training from the North Koreans. \n\nSo what started to move this dual track of careful stewardship of the economy combined with the use of repressive force to cement the ruling party's hold on the state towards the catastrophe of hyperinflation, economic failure, and comprehensive brutality towards political dissent? \n\nThe conventional interpretation in the international mass media is that the main impetus for the breakdown of the ruling party's discipline was animus towards white farmers, leading to a policy of careless, lawless land seizures and the collapse of the agricultural economy. \n\nI would tend to argue that it's a bit more complicated than that, and that the land seizures and attention to white farmers were something of a deliberate distraction. Distraction from what? From the slow crumbling of a more disciplined approach to economic management and the party's retreat from supporting various experiments in alternative approaches to development. The participants in early cooperative farms and businesses sensed that by the late 1980s, they were getting the cold shoulder from previously friendly or solicitous figures in the government. At the same time, leading party figures by the late 1980s were being increasingly tempted to engage in modest-scale corruption in order to sustain their new lifestyle as successful ministers and bureaucrats. The most notable sign of this shift was the Willowvale Scandal. It's hard now to appreciate that news of the scandal was broken by reporters working for the *government-published newspaper*, but it just shows you that the first 5-10 years of independence had a different spirit. The scandal centered on one of two plants that were set up to assemble cars from parts built elsewhere by a number of major manufacturers; it turned out that ministers and other officials were in various ways receiving illicit benefits from this manufacture.\n\nWillowvale also laid bare another issue, which was that Zimbabwe's government had decided to pay fairly large foreign debts it inherited on a tight schedule with the goal of being out of debt as quickly as possible--which left it in a currency crunch. That would turn out to be a major problem from that point forward--a problem that only got worse once the state did start looking to confiscate land held by white farmers, since tobacco sales were a big source of forex. \n\nBut what I think happened in Willowvale is that the upper echelons of the state decided that they weren't going to care any longer about diligent management or fighting corruption. Maurice Nyagumbo, the most prominent official caught in the scandal, killed himself out of shame. (Some have wondered if that's what really happened, but I think Nyagumbo was actually a pretty sincere reformer\/revolutionary, so the shame was real.) That was the last time that the upper reaches of power was bothered by shame, though. \n\nWhich is what I think brought the repressive capacities of the state to the fore, and a desire to use them to create distractions intended to hold on to the ruling party's rural base. Which is what led to the land seizures--but also to a generalized contempt for the major cities and the kinds of wealth they could create and support. \n\nThis also meant that increasingly the government depended upon a militarized police force, the actual military, and various unofficial paramilitary forces (the so-called \"war veterans\", who often weren't in fact war veterans, led for a time by Chinjerai Hunzvi) to conduct land seizures and harass both real and imagined enemies--and all of them needed to be paid off, along with regular civil servants. This also hollowed out the ranks of the leadership--the more competent ministers left the government over the 1990s, for the most part. Which led in turn to the disastrous hyperinflation that became Zimbabwe's hallmark for a while, fueled in part simply by printing more money in order to pay off government obligations to soldiers, police, its informal forces, and civil servants. Going past that point of no return takes us past this subreddit's chronological limit, but I don't think much has changed since that juncture--the chance to maintain the relative probity of the first decade of power was lost for good during the second decade. \n\nThat does raise some deeper structural questions about the nature of what historian Frederick Cooper has called \"the gatekeeper state\" in sub-Saharan Africa, but that's a bigger and more complicated discussion. I honestly think that some of what went wrong in the late 1980s amounts to bad decisions made by people who should have known better and was not structurally inevitable or preordained, but on this point there is considerable debate among historians of postcolonial Africa in general.","upvotes":17,"created_utc":1678228465.0}]},{"title":"Recommendations on histories of Early Rome?","author":"TrainofThought1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ldui9\/recommendations_on_histories_of_early_rome\/","text":"Hi there, I am looking for recommendations for books, articles, sources, or documentaries that explore the history of early Rome and pre-history Italy.

Under the Mission system, native people would be baptized and conscripted into a system designed to disrupt native communities and lifeways and bind them into the missionary project.\n\n>...Spanish colonial policies attempted to sever the relationship between Indigenous People and their relatives, as well as between Indigenous People and the land. Rather than visiting Indigenous communities to peach, Franciscans practiced *reduccion* (reduction) of Indigenous People from their home communities... Missionaries reasoned that Indigenous People either needed to confess their sins or endure physical chastisement to correct sinful behavior and save their souls.\n\n(*We Are the Land*, Akins and Bauer (pg 67))\n\nIndigenous people were brought to missions disconnected from their homelands and communal contexts and resources, and baptized. \"...In a state of what historian James Sandos calls \"spiritual debt peonage\"\", Mission Indians were expected to spend the rest of their lives working for the Padres and the mission in exchange for the blessings of Catholicism, performing any or all the necessary labor for the operation of the mission, including building the missions themselves, performing craftwork, farming, raising livestock, etc. \n\nThe environmental damage of the missions - particularly the harms of free range livestock - further disrupted the lifeways of coastal native peoples, who would sometimes flee further inland, sometimes resist, but in other cases join the missions in an effort to make a life for themselves. Mission Indians were subject to unsanitary and unsafe conditions, violence and violent discipline, and were not allowed to leave. \"Runaway\" neophytes would be hunted down by Spanish soldiers and could be subject to flogging and other punishments, and natives who fought back against the Spanish and lost were often forced from their homes and taken back to the missions. Due to the conditions, the life expectancy for Mission Indians was around 10-12 years, and the death rate throughout the system exceeded the birth rate. When the working population of natives fell too low, the Franciscans would recruit Spanish soldiers and go capture and enslave free native people. \n\nSkipping over the independent Mexican period (though this did include the continued enslavement and conscription of Indigenous People), the State of California, to our shame, was founded in part on explicit policies of genocide and slavery. The so-called \"Indian Child Protection Act\" of 1850 established the legal basis for the enslavement of orphaned children of Indigenous People. Because the state was also supported individual acts of violence against native communities and sponsoring militias to go out and massacre native villages, they would often create these orphans themselves, who would then be \"protected\" through their enslavement to their attackers. In other cases, white Americans did not go through the trouble of actually killing Indigenous People and simply kidnapped and enslaved children. \n\nAmerican Californians continued a Mexican practice of considering Indigenous People's labor to be granted with the purchase of land, and settlers would force local people to work lands they acquired. Over the decades, as reservations were established and the BIA took a heavier hand in regulating the affairs of \"Indians\", they would continue the practice of compulsory, unfree labor. Even in the 20th century, BIA agents would contract with municipalities and for profit companies to provide crews of Indigenous laborers - for example, Cahuilla and Kumeyaay people were compelled to construct new water infrastructure in Southern California which would channel legally guaranteed water resources *away* from native communities to provide for white settlers and cities. Finally, the State and BIA also supported the spread of residential schools. \"Indian Boarding Schools\" had the explicit aim of training Indigenous People to perform menial labor, and schools would lease out crews of children to provide agricultural and household labor.","upvotes":27,"created_utc":1678217578.0},{"author":"jschooltiger","text":"Hi, while more can always be said, you may be interested in [this section of our FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/nativeamerican#wiki_native_americans_and_slavery) on Indigenous Americans and slavery.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1678205326.0}]},{"title":"Why didn't Enlightenment thought take off in Spain or Portugal the way it did in the rest of Europe?","author":"adidas713","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11lczj0\/why_didnt_enlightenment_thought_take_off_in_spain\/","text":"From my understanding, a big reason for this was the monarchy, or the Catholic Church having an iron grip on the nations.

Coincidentally I had my family record (jokbo) on hand and in my specific family we have recorded names for women starting in the 11th generation which lines up roughly with the reigns of Sejong and Munjong of the Joseon Dynasty. \n\nSecond thing is that because of the non-literal nature of the statement I wanted to check the original Korean text to see if there were any translation errors (early translations of Korean are quite rough). Honestly, I thought I was going crazy. I could not find this quote even in the book that it is cited from in \u202aGender and Mission Encounters in\u202c \u202aKorea: New Women, Old Ways\u202c. I searched for the compilation and autobiography as well as the name Kim Syok\u2019osu in Korean and I could not find anything which was disconcerting. If anyone can find the quote and send it my way that would be appreciated. But this incongruence doesn\u2019t impact what was going on in Korea much.\n\nSo the Joseon Dynasty is unique amongst the other conventional Korean \u201cunified\u201d dynasties Unified Silla and Goryeo in that women were marginalized to a degree not seen in the previous kingdoms. Silla due to the bone rank system had two Queens in their own right, Seondeok and Jindeok. Goryeo women while still expected to hold traditional roles as wives and mothers had rights to property. \u201cFilial\u201d Piety was not reserved just for fathers but also mothers as well. This was not the case in the Joseon Dynasty. No queen would rule in their own right and what rights women did have would be stripped away.\nOne of the major factors in this shift between the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty is the state sponsored religion, from Buddhism to Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism inherited traditional Confucian gender roles which completely sidelined the autonomy and agency of women.\n\nBy the time Kim Syok\u2019osu would have converted to Christianity Korean society was heavily entrenched in Neo-Confucian ideals. Confucianism\u2019s place in society was so high that the concept of Sojunghwa or \u201cLittle China\u201d developed. To the Joseon Dynasty they were the true inheritors of Sinic culture and tradition as opposed to the \u201cbarbarian\u201d Manchu. To be frank, women were straight up not valued and what value they did have was the dowry attached to them. They were alienated from their birth families after marriage, their husband could divorce them essentially at will, and to top it all off widows were expected to stay unwed. \n\nSo while yes the quote is a hyperbole it does capture the essence of womanhood in Joseon Korea. For over 500 years the state sponsored ideology had the marginalization of women as fundamental to a well functioning society.\n\nEdit: So I went back to the Jokbo and it was in fact not the names of the women recorded but rather the names of their husbands. Women technically had names, but in the records they were nameless. \n\n\u202a\uad8c\uc21c\ud615, \u201c\uace0\ub824\uc758 \uac00\uc871\uc81c\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5ec\uc131\uc758 \uc0dd\ud65c\u201d \u202c\n\n(The cited book in New Women, Old Ways is \u202aVictorious Lives of Early Christians in Korea: The\u202c \u202aFirst Book of Biographies and Autobiographies of Early Christians in the Protestant Church in Korea\u202c)","upvotes":409,"created_utc":1678168123.0}]},{"title":"I know there\u2019s still a heated discussion about it; but is there a broad historical consensus in regards to the bombing of Dresden, Germany?","author":"cbock3006","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11lqv9z\/i_know_theres_still_a_heated_discussion_about_it\/","text":"Unfortunately for years, much of the research on Dresden parroted NAZI propaganda and people fell into 2 camps. \u201cIt was an allied atrocity\u201d or \u201cthe Germans had it coming\u201d I was just wondering what the most modern nuanced take on the bombing were, thanks :)","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678264310.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Mexico, for instance, still had issues with indigenous enslavement into the 20th century. Indigenous slavery was also deeply embedded in the Mexican culture of the territories annexed by the United States after the Mexican-American War, and it was adopted by many of the American settlers of the region, and was not officially abolished until after the American Civil War. I do not know as much about Latin American countries other than Mexico, so I cannot speak to when indigenous enslavement ended there, but I can say that it was a deeply-rooted institution for most of the Spanish colonial period.\n\nBut while it doesn't exactly fit the criteria you describe, I think the Yamasee War of 1715-1718 is a useful illustration of how indigenous communities responded to and resisted enslavement, as well as the complex interactions between black and indigenous slavery. \n\nFor a bit of background: the first permanent English settlement in the modern United States was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. Black slavery began fairly early on (1619), but some Virginians also stepped into the indigenous slave trade. They found a willing partner in the Westos, a group that had been forced south from the Great Lakes by Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) expansionism. When the Carolina Colony was settled at Charleston in 1670, the Westos had been raiding other indigenous communities to capture slaves for a while; but Carolina would take the business to a whole new level. In the process they would decimate the indigenous communities of the American southeast. \n\nAfter tiring of the Westos, the Carolinians hired a group of Shawnees to eliminate the tribe. They made new alliances across the southeast. The result was a bloodbath. It was raid or be raided; no one was safe. Florida, under Spanish control, was completely devastated by a series of joint Mvskoke-Carolinian raids, with the entire peninsula being almost entirely depopulated outside of St. Augustine. During this period, one of Carolina's allies were the Yamasees, who lived close to the colony in what is today South Carolina. \n\nIn 1696, a massive smallpox epidemic struck the region. Indigenous people perished in droves. Already facing a crisis due to slave raiding (which especially targeted women), many indigenous communities were now essentially in demographic freefall. The diseases did not stop. Critical to stopping the worst of this was adoption of captives, which was a norm for indigenous societies dating back to pre-Columbian times. The English did not understand this and protested communities being unwilling to sell captives. Tensions began to mount.\n\nNew coalescent societies formed; the strongest groups, the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Creek (Mvskoke) took in vast amounts of refugees and quickly became the largest and most powerful tribes in the region. Smaller tribes like the Yamasee grew nervous. They feared that the English, already aligned with most of the largest groups except the Choctaw (who were French allies) would have no use for the Yamasee and enslave them en masse. Abuses by English traders had also provoked plenty of resentment anong the largest indigenous groups. And so, in 1715, a mass revolt broke out - almost every Native society across the southeast came together, killed any English traders residing in their villages, and began to advance on the Carolina Colony. \n\nHad the English not managed to win over the Cherokee and Catawba to their side, the Yamasee very well could have won. They achieved dramatic victories in the early phases of the war and the Carolinian death toll is, percentage-wise, one of the highest of *any* war fought by the United States or its colonial predecessors. Though the English won, the war had shown them the dangers caused by the indigenous slave trade. Native slavery in Carolina plummeted from over 1\/4 of households to almost nothing. Some of this decline was because Carolina, terrified that their black slaves might band together with the Yamasee and overwhelm the colony, began to enforce a new racial boundary: the child of a black and indigenous person was, legally, fully black. \n\nUnfortunately for the Yamasee, the damage was already done. The surviving tribal members integrated into other tribes, and southeastern indigenous societies would never be the same as they were before the slave trade had arrived. Anglo-American slavery would eventually become synonymous with African slavery. \n\nSources:\n\n*The Other Slavery* by Andr\u00e9s Res\u00e9ndez\n\n*Mapping the Mississippian Shatter Zone* ed. by Robbie Ethridge and Sheri M.

Note that I'll be dealing with the Catholic monastic tradition much more than the Orthodox one due to my knowledge background.\n\nThe first thing to understand about monastic history is that each new foundation believed that they were recreating the community of the Apostles that formed shortly after Jesus's death. Here's the key passage from Acts, using an English translation of the Latin Vulgate text that medieval people used:\n\n>Acts 4:32 And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common unto them.\n\nEvery new monastic order was founded as an attempt to return to the ideals expressed here: A community of believers who have no possessions of their own but share all things in common. Because monastic reformers were always reaching for the same ideal, the communities' stated purposes can often sound very similar. However, due to each order's unique founder and political and economic situation, the reality on the ground could be very different from order to order.\n\nNext, let's talk about a few different categories of monastic orders. First, there's monks. Ever since the 6th century Rule of Benedict, monks' vows include a vow of stability, which links them to a particular physical place forever. In *theory*, monks rarely leave the monastery because they are sworn to its physical location.The Benedictines take three vows: Obedience, Stability, and the Conversion of Life. You might notice that chastity and poverty are not on this list. They are both *implied* as part of the conversion of life, but the absence of poverty in the Benedictine Rule would become a sticking point in later movements.\n\nThere is a major difference between individual poverty and communal poverty. The Benedictines technically had no personal property, but their communities became incredibly wealthy. New monks and nuns were often expected to bring donations of land with them akin to dowries when they were promised to a monastery. (Note that for Benedictines in the early medieval period, there was not a huge difference between monks and nuns - most monks were not ordained priests yet at this time and so couldn't celebrate Mass any more than a nun could.)\n\nBenedictine monasteries thus became major landowners and, in turn, political powerhouses. As the Middle Ages wore on, there were reformers who felt that this was not in keeping with the spirit of Acts 4:32. After all, Christ had said that if you sell your possessions and give to the poor, you will have treasure in Heaven (Matthew 19:21). Was becoming an aristocratic lord who ruled over vast monastic properties *really* following the spirit of this idea? The Cistercians were created as a \"refoundation\" of the Benedictines based on the idea that the Benedictines had lost sight of poverty, and they recommitted to the Rule of Benedict with a stricter interpretation of its calls to poverty. However, once the Cistercians got popular, they too got patronage from the wealthy and powerful, and the cycle began again.\n\nOf all the poverty-minded reformers, the most novel were the mendicant friars. Friars are different from monks in that they take vows of poverty and chastity, and no vows of stability. The word \"mendicant\" comes from the Latin *mendicare*, \"to beg.\" The first major mendicant friars were the Franciscans founded by Francis of Assisi. Francis abandoned the wealth of his merchant family and committed to a radical life of poverty without a fixed home. Instead, he intended to spend his life wandering and begging for sustenance. The Franciscans were soon followed by the Dominicans, followers of Dominic de G\u00fazman, who had a similarly outward-focused ministry that downgraded stability in favour of poverty.\n\nWithout being tied to a rural monastery, friars were able to access the laity more directly. They quickly became popular in cities. More of them were ordained as priests, so they could offer the sacrament directly to people. This brought them into conflict with the parish clergy, which is why there was so much [satire](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/euq92g\/perhaps_the_most_visible_example_of_medieval\/) about friars in medieval Europe. The Franciscans and Dominicans created vast international orders, which the Cistercians had done before them, but the difference was that because they didn't take vows of stability, the friars utilized this network to send their people all over the known world as preachers.\n\nThe friars were not the only monastics who had a more pastoral focus than the Benedictines. Long before Benedict of Nursia wrote his rule, Augustine of Hippo came up with a brief outline of the ideal religious life. The Rule of Augustine was a composite of a few different writings by Augustine about the monastic life. It had a major influence on Benedict. However, there were other groups who took a more direct inspiration from Augustine without using the Rule of Benedict as a middleman. These include Augustinian canons, who were not monks since they do not take vows of stability. They lived in priories, rather than monasteries, and were theoretically more interested in actively catering to the needs of laypeople than Benedictines were.\n\nThe last kind of monastic category to discuss is the hermit. Hermits have a tradition going far back into the beginning of monasticism, which started with individual men and women going into the deserts of Egypt to leave civilization behind. Much to their annoyance, followers began to come around them. From that point onward, hermits never lived in true isolation. Sometimes people founded entire religious orders dedicated to hermits, such as the Camaldolese Hermits founded in the early 11th century. Other times hermits lived apart from, but as members of, a normal monastery. Other monks might come and bring them food once a day. (I've written a bit more about hermits living in caves [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/udv7cl\/comment\/i6l1006\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).) Hermits like these who lived as remote members of a church community were sometimes known as anchorites. This became a particularly popular form of eremitic life for women in the later medieval period, perhaps the most famous being Julian of Norwich. Anchorites sometimes subscribed to a Rule, but not always.\n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages, there were dozens of religious orders. Some of them are definitely pretty similar to each other. The Praemonstratensians, for example, are very similar to other Augustinian regular canons. Why are there so many separate orders then? Well, not all new orders achieved the international reach that the Cistercians, Franciscans and Domincans did. A charismatic preacher could inspire some local people to join them in their new order, and in a much less centralized political world, local leaders might be persuaded to support them with a donation of land. In another place in a slightly different time, someone else would get a similar idea.\n\nAnother reason is that there was a lot of factionalism. The Apostolic Brethren were founded by a guy whose application to join the Franciscans got rejected. The Capuchins were founded by Franciscans who believed the mainstream order had gone too commercial, much as the Cistercians had once felt about the Benedictines. The Poor Clares are followers of Clare of Assisi, who was even more ascetic than Francis and who wasn't allowed to become a Franciscan because she was a woman. The examples go on and on. Groups like the Poor Clares and the Capuchins fall under the umbrella term of \"Franciscan\", much as \"Augustinian canons\" is an umbrella term.\n\nI hope this helps explain why there are so many different groups!

While it was no doubt a significant part of the Nazi war machine and freed many loyal subjects for military roles who would otherwise have to man the war economy, slave labour was poorly motivated, poorly trained, and importantly, prone to sabotage. Cases of sabotage were recorded in multiple weapon systems manufactured by forced labour; off the top of my head, submarines, late war semi-automatic rifles and explosives all had cases of recorded sabotage which created casualties for the German military. The submarine sabotages were especially dangerous since, well, submarines are boats designed to almost but not quite sink, and there was a lot they could go wrong in the middle of the ocean with no help available anywhere. To a certain degree coerced labour may have been inevitable, since the Germans had an imperative to economically integrate conquered lands to assist in their war efforts, but German racial policies made the workers disposable (in some camps, working them to death was a goal, not a biproduct, although that wasn't the case everywhere), which meant low skill utilization and high discontent. \n\nIn terms of manpower, the Allgemeine SS tied up about 100,000 men at its peak in only rear-line, occupation and genocide related duties. That was about two army corps worth of manpower, not to mention the organizational resources dedicated to their ghastly task. This does not include the Waffen-SS, which had 900,000 men who were directly involved in combat. While the Waffen-SS were not distracted by Nazi genocidal programs as much (although they did take every opportunity to execute undesirables among prisoners), it did create significant organizational duplication: the Waffen-SS had independent command, procurement, recruitment etc. which could have been unified within the Wehrmacht. However, the Waffen-SS served a political purpose in being the Nazi Party's direct military arm, safeguarding the political establishment against coups from the military, which was not directly affected by the Party's racial policies; many authoritarian regimes have such an organization regardless of their penchant for genocide. \n\nBut the greatest disadvantage that the Nazi ideology imposed upon its military operations was the resistance that it impelled within occupied territories. In the Soviet Union in particular, early Nazi advances through the east, which largely consisted of non-Russian Soviet territories, were actually quite happy to welcome the Germans as liberators. Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Belarusians and especially Ukrainians were quite fed up with the oppression under Stalinist control and would welcome a change of leadership. However, due to Nazi racial policy, these peoples were considered subhumans and therefore the new regime was very much like the old regime in many, many ways. Ukrainians at the time especially had very recent memories of Stalin's genocidal policies during the Holodomor and many might have switched sides had they gotten even equivalent treatment to Germany's western enemies like France. The Nazi policy of mass killings and atrocities among both civilians and POW stiffened Ukrainian resistance and resolve. As it was, Ukraine under Nazi occupation was near a state of civil war, with pro-Soviet Union, pro-Nazi and pro-independence partisan groups of various stripes and levels of radicalism engaging in all sorts of partisan activities, which wreaked havoc on critical logistical lines the Germans were using to supply Army Group South, including Case Blue, the operation that would culminate in the failed Battle of Stalingrad that would mark the turn of Nazi fortunes. \n\nJust in Ukraine, Nazi occupation required 250,000 men in 1942, although only 15,000 were Germans with the rest being Ukrainian collaborators, and put a further four million motivated Ukrainians on the other side of the equation in the Soviet army, accounting for nearly 40% of the Red Army's troops, which is remarkable considering the size of Ukraine with respect to the rest of the USSR. While not all 4 million Ukrainians may have fought on the Nazi side, a more racially neutral Nazi Germany may have had millions of Ukrainian, Belorussian and Baltic auxiliaries who had an axe to grind against Soviet Russia, while the Red Army would have had a lot less loyal soldiers who were eager to liberate their own homeland. Some German generals post-war advanced that such policies would have been necessary for Germany to have an actual winning strategy against Russia (although Nazi generals' post-war memoirs are generally considered unreliable first-hand sources nowadays). Even discounting the loyalties of Soviet subjects, Nazi racial policies were well-known and non-white combatants learnt very quickly to avoid capture at all cost, and would refuse to surrender for that much longer knowing that a shallow trench and a bullet to the back of the head awaited them rather than a harsh but survivable prisoner of war camp. This affected not only the Slavic and Asiatic majorities in the Soviet Union, but also Moroccan and Algerians within the Free French armies, British Indians and of course Black Americans. Nazi racism forced their enemies to fight just that much harder rather than surrender in the face of adversity.","upvotes":23,"created_utc":1678258813.0}]},{"title":"A lot of cities changed countries after the formation of new borders in the wake of WW2, and many people were displaced.

There was a historic region of the former Kingdom of Georgia (sort of like how Italy or Germany were \"geographic expressions\" at the time), but it was split into several different kingdoms, Imereti in the west, and Kartli and Kakheti in the east. Furthermore, the west of the area was under Ottoman suzerainty, and the eastern parts under Persian suzerainty. Imereti and Mingrelia often weren't considered \"Georgia\" proper for good measure - whether the people there are a subdivision\/dialect of Georgian or a separate ethnicity is a whole other question we won't get into. \n\nSo even on 18th century maps, the naming can be a bit all over the place. [Here](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c3\/Buffier-Georgia3n.jpg) is a weird map from 1736, but it shows the regional name \"Georgia\" over Imereti and the eastern kingdoms, which are divided and colored differently on the map. [This map](https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:18th-century_maps_of_the_Caucasus#\/media\/File:Johann_Baptist_Homann._Imperii_Persici_In_Omnes_Suas_Provincias._Caucasus.JPG) shows something similar. [This map](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/82\/Imperium_Turcicum_in_Europa%2C_Asia_et_Africa_Regiones_Propias%2C_Tributaias_Clientelares.jpg) for example lists \"Georgia\" as a geographic expression over Kartli and Kakheti, while showing them as separate kingdoms, and *also* naming Kartli as \"Gurcistan\", which is just the Persian version of the word \"Georgia\". Imereti and Mingrelia are shown as separate. [This map](https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:18th-century_maps_of_the_Caucasus#\/media\/File:Ottens_Reinier_and_Josua._Regnum_persicum,_Imperium_turcicum_in_Asia,_russorum_provinciae_ad_mare_Caspium_\\(18th_century\\).E.jpg) does something similar, showing (in Latin) a \"Kingdom of Georgia\" that is subdivided into Kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti. The two kingdoms were unified in 1762 and then battled over by the Russian and Persian Empires until Russia annexed it in 1801.\n\nSo: while the names are the same in English and Latin, I can't imagine it was a big concern that the colony would be confused with a geographic region in the Caucasus that was actually made up of a number of kingdoms under Persian or Ottoman control.","upvotes":36,"created_utc":1678203563.0}]},{"title":"Good sources to research the werewolf trials?","author":"SmudgedSophie1717","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11l9p9y\/good_sources_to_research_the_werewolf_trials\/","text":"Looking into the werewolf witch trials, and I'm having trouble finding accessible academic sources.

I was who they called when the hardest jobs came up. I copied the first news of Stalin\u2019s death. I located the signal when the first Soviet jet bomber made its first flight from Moscow to Smolensk; we all knew what to listen for, but I was the one who heard it. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say that he was the first to know the news. In fact, if we make the obvious assumption that the news was in Russian and encoded, he didn\u2019t know what he was copying at all. His telling of this story is at least possible, if we accept that a Morse code signal preceded official announcement of Stalin\u2019s death and that Cash was informed of the contents of his signal after it was decrypted.\n\nHowever, [veterans of the USAFSS](https:\/\/usafss19481979.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/05\/johnnycashusafss-note-1.pdf) doubt even this interpretation, for two reasons: (1) veterans of that era don\u2019t remember this incident at all, which surely would have been momentous when it happened, and (2) it\u2019s unclear why a \u201dlow level Russian radio operator\u201d would have received this news before it was officially announced by the Soviet Communist Party.\n\nCash's account could still be accurate; it's also possible that Cash was simply listening to Radio Moscow in English at the right moment, or that he was exaggerating to emphasize the security importance of the messages he was decoding at the time of Stalin\u2019s death. It is true that [USAFSS servicemen apparently learned of many incidents before they hit the newspapers](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=685050541900190&id=145731189165464), which makes any exaggeration easy to understand.\n\nEdit: By request of the mods here's a paper with more background on the USAFSS history: Shackelford, Philip Clayton. *On the Wings of the Wind: The United States Air Force Security Service and Its Impact on Signals Intelligence in the Cold War*. Diss. Kent State University, 2014. (This dissertation has additional oral testimony about the Morse code intercepts although none about Cash.)

'Horses won't charge into spears' is a common truism, but we have accounts of horses *doing exactly that*. (See dandan_noodles' post linked below.)\n\n> Then wouldn\u2019t it mean that this tactic is highly risky and ineffective ?\n\nThe mounted troops have the advantage of mobility. One can always disengage from the charge before it strikes. Further, you're overlooking the important factor of morale. Sure, the soldiers on foot may have numbers (infantry are always cheaper than cavalry) and a solid formation, but...\n\nHere's a practical demonstration for you: Measure out 330cm from the ground. Assuming a horse of 16 hands and a rider of 172cm (5'8\" for you non-metric types), that's approximately how tall the combined horse and rider are. Now, imagine that 3.3-meter-tall figure coming at you at about 40 kilometers per hour.\n\nHorses are big. A combatant on a horse is *extra* big. And when you've got a big bugger on a blighted big bastard of a horse coming straight at you, hooves pounding the ground and making the earth shake, **that shit is scary.** Now imagine that our lad has got twenty more guys backing him up, all of them on horses just as big.\n\nHow long will your nerve hold? Are you quite certain that you can stand? The man on the horse is very likely a noble, or at least rich - so he's got better equipment than you do and probably has been brought up to use it, and you *know* that. Swinging from the horse means he has the advantage of gravity. Sure, you have numbers...but what use are numbers when half your guys are wavering? The moment the horsemen see that you've got an unsteady formation, they're going to charge home because they *know* you'll waver, and that's all the opportunity they need.\n\nOkay, so you manage to hold, and the cavalry this time decided not to charge home. So you breathe a sigh of relief. But even still, the sight of a cavalry squadron galloping *directly at you*, lances aimed specifically *for you*, is fucking scary. Even if they veer off, that's still not an easy sight to endure. Can you stand *again*, knowing that they might decide to charge home and spit you upon their lances? How many times can you see a hundred horses shattering the earth running towards you before you decide \"to hell with this\" and turn tail?\n\nOf course, this is not the entirety of things, but I do hope I've impressed just *how much* the psychological axis matters with cavalry. For further matters, here's a few previous posts for your consideration:\n\n* Here's [a previous compilation of cavalry-related answers](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/je1nx9\/what_were_pregunpowder_cavalry_melee_doctrines\/), linked to save on username pings and because u\/dandan_noodles also has a comment in thread that addresses some of your concerns;\n* Also relevant is u\/Hergrim's [Knightly Post](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/8g1s7n\/im_a_knight_in_the_medeival_era_ive_just_charged\/dy9ba21\/), illustrating Medieval cavalry combat.

I'm going to highlight the tactics used by the Eastern Roman Empire; after all, they were the most experienced, well armed and disciplined military force in medieval Europe and the middle east having over a millenium's worth of military experience to draw upon. Despite their reputation for embarassing losses, the medieval Romans won most of the battles they fought and the medieval roman army would successfully repel incursions time and time again which allowed the Empire to survive for as long as it did despite being a largely defensive power. \n\nIt also helps that the Byzantines maintained military manuals such as the Strategikon and Taktika that provide insights into their equipment and tactics as they would evolve over the centuries with changing strategic realities for the Empire. \n\nThe Byzantine heavy cavalry, known as Cataphracti or Kataphraktoi was a descendant of the Late Roman Clibanarii. Their equipment was special compared to other European cavalry units in that they were armed with both lances and bows along with secondary weapons such as maces and curved swords. \n\nAs the top reply mentioned, cavalry tactics relied as much on psychology as they did on the capability of the cavalry itself and the Byzantines were well aware of that. Thus their main tactical units- the *numeri*- were 300-400 man strong and 8-10 ranks deep like the late hellenistic phalanx of old. They would also charge in a wedge formation with the front line being the thinnest at 25 men wide with the second and third having 5 more men each and the subsequent lines after that having 10 additional men per new line. From a distance, it gave an illusion of higher numbers than what they actually had while preventing any momentum loss during a charge since depth was maintained. They also made sure to bring a large number of riders to ensure minimal casualties for the highest pay off. Emperor Nikephoros II states in his 'On Skirmishing' that the Emperor would not set out on campaign at all if he had less than 8,000 riders (24 banda of 300 men each) for his field army especially when fighting the Arabs who also fielded competent cavalry. \n\nThey also avoided frontal charges whenever they could and would prefer flanking and envelopment attacks with the infantry acting as a pinning force or being used to create openings for the cavalry. They would also employ feigned retreats and false charges wherein lighter cavalry units would charge at the enemy but turn back at the last moment while firing back (Parthian shot) in order to make the enemy lose formation or morale so that they would either give chase or they would disrupt their formation which would give the heavy cavalry the opening it needed.\n\nIf, however, they would have to charge frontally then the cavalry would charge slow at first to conserve stamina- remember that the horse is already pretty burdened, it has to carry a heavily armed and armored rider while also being heavily armored itself, this makes overheating very easy if stamina is not preserved- while doing so, the front ranks would shoot arrows into the enemy front lines in order to create gaps which provided a unique conundrum to the enemy infantry, if they would come together to brace against the lances then it would make them more vulnerable to high volume arrow fire and if they spread out then they would become easy pickings for the lancers. Any return fire, on the other hand, either from foot or mounted archers was simply ignored since it was insufficient to penetrate Byzantine heavy armor- imagine the enemy's terror at the sight of armored cavalrymen slowly advancing towards you while simply ignoring your arrow fire.  \n\nFinally, when the Cataphracts either ran out of arrows or if the enemy was sufficiently weakened, they would gallop to a charge with their lances in hand. The wedge formation was also effective in this regard as it allowed the rear ranks to continue firing at the enemy until they themselves got close. This was enough to break most enemies they encountered as most of their enemies fielded very light, undisciplined infantry. Most would simply run the moment the Cataphracts started galloping. \n\nThe Byzantines would also take advantage of their disciplined and better equipped infantry- a legacy they continued from their ancient Roman days- in contrast to their opponents who would mostly just fielded light levies and lightly armed war bands, as is noted in the Taktika. The infantry would charge first under archer cover to create openings which could be exploited by the cavalry. They would also use this tactic if the opponent fielded armored cavalry such as the Western European armies of the Lombards and Franks who, Leo notes, were devastating in frontal attacks but had little to no battle order and were ill-disciplined a fact the Byzantines thoroughly exploited. \n\nAt the end of the day, what made the medieval Romans superior to their enemies wasn't necessarily superior equipment and numbers but rather their discipline and organisation, relying on established military tactics passed down to the next generation of military commanders through codified military manuals, superior depth of logistics through their ancient infrastructure and good reconnoitre along with knowledge of terrain since most of the lands they fought in once used to be a part of their Empire.","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678213170.0}]},{"title":"How accurate are Modern History TV's videos on Medieval England?","author":"RemtonJDulyak","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11l9w3h\/how_accurate_are_modern_history_tvs_videos_on\/","text":"The specific YouTube channel is [Modern History TV](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@ModernKnight), by Jason Kingsley (OBE).  \n\nI've fallen in love with the way he shows elements of medieval life, from a knight's training to traveling, to food.  \n\nI'm curious to know how properly researched his videos are, as he doesn't mention sources in the info, aside from listing any guests (like \"SME on archery\" and their name.)","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678219932.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Medieval people washed and bathed fairly frequently, wore perfumes and oils, wore garlands, etc. But there are also a few environmental considerations to think about.\n\n**Clothing**: For most people in Medieval Europe, the majority of their clothing would have been woollen. Certainly, seasonally, people may also have worn linen clothing, or even hemp, and wealthier individuals may have had access to silks, but the vast majority of clothing would have been woven from wool. Thanks to the fibre structures and the lanolin content of wool, it is - to an extent - self-cleaning. As long as it's not too heavily soiled, you can air out a woollen garment for a day or so, and the 'human' smell will largely be gone.\n\n**Heating and Cooking, Lighting**: In any medieval home, the principal source of heat for personal warmth and cooking will have been the hearth. Whether in an open firepit or a dedicated fireplace, this would have been an open coal, charcoal, or firewood fire. Consider that throughout the medieval period, most homes would have a fire on the go and were typically not excellently ventilated, at least not to a modern standard. Indeed, in 1306, the City of London issued an ordnance restricting the use of \"sea coal\" in industry within the city after mass unrest over the soot and pollution that was starting to grow. If you've ever spent any time sat in front of a log fire, you'll know the effect this has on the smell of your clothes, so now consider that this smell is essentially ubiquitous to most dwellings and even the streets of larger settlements. \n\nAs you might have guessed, candles were a very common source of artificial light in the Medieval period, but beeswax candles could be expensive. Far more commonplace were tallow candles made from rendered animal fat. While these were cheap and plentiful, when burned they can give off a pungent, greasy smell, and also produce large quantities of unpleasant smoke compared to a regular wax candle.\n\nSo even if your hypothetical Medieval thief hadn't had the chance to bathe in a few days and had forgotten to air out their clothing, it's unlikely that somebody would smell them over the general smells of smoke, fires, cooking and candle grease, among myriad other smells of the Medieval settlment.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678418985.0}]},{"title":"How much do we know about Punt and Kerma's languages?","author":"SnooPandas1950","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11l1vye\/how_much_do_we_know_about_punt_and_kermas\/","text":"Such lands were written about almost exclusively by Egypt, so the information we have on them is limited.

Henry's 'Love' was always in the context of what he felt was owed to him (privately and professionally) \n\nI'm going to attempt to answer this as best as I can, with the proviso that Henry, as a 16th century Monarch, did not approach 'love' within a marriage in the same way that we would today. I'll break this up, but \n\nFirstly, the marriage between Henry and Catherine was made for political expedience first, with affection being a secondary concern. Henry married Catherine for various reasons, but her exalted position as the daughter of two sovereigns, that is, her image, was certainly part of it. That she was beautiful didn't hurt, of course, but that wasn't the main reason. They were both young and attractive and Catherine seems to have adored Henry all of her life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Context:\n\nHis feelings for her were probably a bit more complex- he respected and admired her because she was his wife and thus worthy of that respect and adoration, but it's clear he turned to other women for romantic and sexual satisfaction, and the length of these relationships- he was involved with his first serious mistress, Elizabeth Blount, for perhaps eight years, suggests an emotional component. Henry seems to have pulled away emotionally even further as it became increasingly clear that Catherine would probably have no more living children. Still, women like Bessie, Mary Boleyn etc never threatened to unseat Catherine because Henry compatmentalised them- they existed for a different purpose than Catherine. He continued to treat Catherine with respect and courtesy if not the kind of love we would expect. \n\nThe issue:\n\nUp until now Catherine had been safe (because he continued to love her in the fashion appropiate to a Tudor arranged marriage with affection included) and because, as I mentioned, Henry kept his passions and his marriage separate. The issue, of course, was that Henry met Anne Boleyn. I want to point out here that as Eric Ives pointed out, Catherine and Henry had not shared a bed in several years by the time Anne came along. Anne was not the catalyst for Henry losing feelings for Catherine- that had happened over degrees when political and childbearing troubles chipped away at his idealism. Anne, however, WAS the catalyst for a new thought in Henry's mind: his loss of love for Catherine collided with his (desperate) love for Anne, which caused him to STOP compartmentlising. Henry did not want an arranged marriage, even with a potential princess who could give him lots of sons. Although he still was emotionally entangled with Catherine, as demonstrated by his absolute reluctance to officially break with her, he was not longer content with a wife he didn't love (even if she loved him.) He continued to feel respect, duty, etc for Catherine, but his love was elsewhere. When she refused to cooperate, even the respect he had for her evaporated.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe're getting into some tricky territory here, historian speaking, but it wouldn't be incorrect to say that Henry, while he loved deeply, was generally unable to maintain that love if he felt his will was not being obeyed, or if he was disappointed. We see a consistent pattern of Henry abruptly turning on those he had favoured if he felt they were disrespecting his authority, OR, in the face of disappointment. His abrupt break with Catherine came when he felt, explicitly, that she was disrespecting his authority by not pretending she had never been his wife. He turned on Anne Boleyn when he became disillusioned with the marriage (due to relationship and political troubles), he had Cromwell executed for insults he later admitted were faked, etc. So any 'love' he felt for Catherine, even at the beginning of the marriage, was always tempered by his beliefs about what she 'owed' to him- which was, if not a son, healthy children. He couldn't seem to conceive that Catherine would be hurt or reluctant to claim their marriage was invalid- which suggests a flaw in his personality. So did Henry love Catherine? the best answer is, possibly, in a restricted sort of way, before their marriage ran into the same political and personal problems which haunted his marriage with Anne later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The Life and Death of *Anne Boleyn Eric Ives* Oxford, Blackwell, 2004","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678589614.0}]},{"title":"History books *written* pre WWII recommendations?","author":"AdPitiful5888","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11l7eza\/history_books_written_pre_wwii_recommendations\/","text":"Just the title really. \n\nLooking for history books written before WWII.

The Germans, figuring they had conquered some land, would make extensive fortifications where they were to hold it, and tried outflanking the allies northwest thru northern France and Belgium and simultaneously south east to Switzerland. The allies countered by building their own defensive lines to prevent the Germans from turning either of the corners (if you want an example of how history repeats itself, you might be interested in the battle of wall building in the Siege of Syracuse by the Athenians). Also due to this situation, the Germans were able to pick their ground to defend, choosing the high ground where they could, and so had much drier trenches. Since they were planning on keeping their new territory until the other side gave in, they also generally put in more effort to build permanent living quarters in the trenches.\n\nThe British on the other hand (I can't speak to the French as readily) viewed their trenches as more of a temporary solution to hold off the Germans until they could break thru the lines and end the stalemate. The conditions in the trenches, being generally on the low ground and already prone to moisture, were generally much less livable and prone to flooding.\n\nAnyway, it wasn't really a matter of waiting for the other side to make a mistake. A lot more of the war was logistical than most people think about - feign by building up a mass of troops in one section, hoping to draw your enemy away from where you're going to attack, lay down the bombardment, and then a push 'over-the-top'.\n\nMost of the battles of the first world war were also more tactical than strategic. The lines moved and changed pretty frequently due to artillery barrages, raids, and attacks. If your line curves into the enemy line (known as a salient) you can hit further into the enemy back line as well as get an enfilade angle on the enemy, but there will also be a lot more enemy guns that can hit that salient position. A lot of the more minor attacks were to 'straighten out the lines' to prevent the enemy from getting an advantage by enlarging a salient, or to reclaim a hill (generally a term used very generously in trench warfare) that would allow the enemy to see further behind your lines than you're comfortable with - that sort of thing.\n\nThe major pushes that we hear a lot about (like the Somme or Passchendaele for example) were generally much larger, thoroughly planned out international affairs. It wasn't a case of running into a hail of bullets and hoping for better results than the last time, many new strategies were employed to give the attacker any advantage, from smoke, gas, tanks, rolling barrages, box barrages, mining operations\/detonations, close air support (read \"Sagittarius Rising\" by Cecil Lewis to get a first hand account of this from a pilots perspective during the Somme), etc. I'm sure I'm still forgetting things.\n\nThe truth is that a large scale attack at the beginning of WW1 would be carried out drastically differently than at the height of trench warfare, and then again it would drastically change once the stalemate was broken and Americans joined in full force.\n\nI read a lot of primary sources from WW1, if you're looking for something specific or first hand accounts of something, let me know and I will try to put together a good list of sources for you.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678222717.0},{"author":"AudrasThrowaway","text":"Trench warfare as depicted in movies largely ignores a lot of the strategic and tactical races that actually happened on the ground.\n\n**How did they get there:**\n\nIn 1914, as the Germans fell back after the Marne offensive. They had been repulsed by the French and British mostly due to some supply issues (and ironically a tiny little bit of the Netherlands called the Maastricht appendix that forced their rail lines to bog down). They had a war on two fronts and the Allies, especially Britain, had smaller standing armies than Russia. Germany dug in on the West and began fighting heavily in the East.\n\nWe used to believe the Germans thought of the trench in ways like the French or British, buying time to build up their forces, but more recent scholarship and the Soviet archives returning documents captured in WW2 give us a better picture: The Germans were fairly panicked and buying time. Russia did a lot better than they anticipated in the East, and they had thought their initial offensive would be too fast and strong for Russia or the Anglo-French to stop.\n\nInitially, they dug in on a prominent series of chalk rides across France and Belgium. Because German trenches occupied the highest points, the mud symbolic to the conflict in the British and French imagination was not always present for German troops. The movie *1917* does a nice job of showing the differentiation in his way. British and French troops recalled vividly in diaries their WTF moments realizing the Germans had built near cities honeycombing some of the chalk ridges.\n\nOnce the Germans dug in, the allies tried to out flank them, so the Germans kept digging. This is what became known as the \"Race to the Sea\" as both sides tried to outflank one another toward the Atlantic coast.\n\nMost of these trenches did run parallel and could be anywhere between 100 and several thousand yards apart. In the early months of the conflict, trenches were not substantial, more like connected foxholes that were dug deeper to allow standings. Eventually, they came to have a much more proscriptive style of building with a firing step, sand backs, exit points, listening posts, dug outs to take shelter in during artillery bombardment, and even concrete pill boxes. Trenches were not straight. From the outset of the trench warfare, they built in a zig-zag pattern. If a shell exploded, this blocked shrapnel from flying into other troops.\n\nSecondary and tertiary lines (reserve trenches) would eventually become common and connected by other trenches (communications trenches). Trenches would also incorporate town ruins, cellars, woods, and roads to help fortify themselves. By Spring of 1918, things opened up once more, and trenches gave ay to a more mobile form of warfare. *Eyes Deep in Hell* by John Ellis, although older, illustrated these progressions well.\n\n**Wave attacks\/\u201dLions led by Donkeys\u201d**\n\nGetting up in mass and running at the enemy position is ahistorical and mostly an invention of the 1960s at the 50th commemoration and antiwar sentiment for Vietnam. There were accusations of incompetence beforehand, but this wasn\u2019t the main narrative until the 60s. (This was about the same time that antiwar poets get big, but for most servicemen, they were proud of their war service and felt it had real meaning). Jay Winter has written extensively about the memorialization of the war, and *Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning* covers the politicization of the war\u2019s meaning and commemoration.\n\nAttacks did occur in waves at times, but these were generally Russians on the Eastern Front or American attacks in 1917 (Pershing and the AEF were stubborn and ignored British and French advice on the matter at first). In Prior and Wilson\u2019s book, *The Somme*, they showed that most British Corps commanders empowered their divisional and battalion commanders (sometimes down to the platoon level) to do any number of things to close the distance across No Man\u2019s Land before attack: creep out into shell holes at night, built trenches forward, or even build shelters in no man\u2019s land so men could shelter and then \u201cjump off.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there were not failures at the highest level. At the command level, the British clung to the idea through 1916 that they would win a Napoleonic Victory: creating a gap in the line wide enough through which they could pour their cavalry forces. In *The Killing Ground*, Tim Travers does a great job at outlining why the GHQ thought process was so limited: mostly they were educated on a traditional battlefield and defaulted to that thinking under stress. It was a period of modelling and scientific organization of information, so they believed they had a concrete 'way' to win the war.\n\n**How did attacks unfold?**\n\nAttacks had a rhythm, and the details changed over time.\n\nHowever, through the war, there are common components: First, you pulverized defenses. High explosives would attempt to disrupt trenches and dug outs where troops would shelter. Mines might be employed to do the same. Gas could also be used, but this depended on wind direction (at Loos the British and Germans repeatedly gassed their own troops in 1915 as they figured things out).\n\nA secondary important form of artillery would be shrapnel shot designed to break down the barbed wire in front of enemy trenches. The wire was one of the first signs trenches warfare was a permanent feature of the conflict in 1914 and it was problematic throughout the war. These were not single wires but thick nearly wall like obstacles made from it. Some armies might also employ wire cutters to crawl over and work ahead of the attack, but this was very risky.  Failing to cut wire could end attacks cold. The decision to move the Somme offensive from a 12 to 25 mile front with no increase in artillery allocation meant many troops found wire and defenses intact the morning of July 1. Artillery won ground in trench warfare. \n\nNext, soldiers had to cross the battlefield. They would have closed distance early and as the war progressed both sides used a creeping barrage, essentially a curtain of shell fire that the infantry followed behind on a pre-agreed upon time schedule. This mean that the opposition could not prepare for their approach because they would receive shell fire and then the enemy would be right on top of them.\n\nSo troops are fighting in the trench, but there are two lines of reserve that will try to retake it. By 1917, most sides adopted \u201cBite and Hold\u201d meaning they would consolidate on their captured trench and relaunch another attack forward. To allow that to happen, the creeping barrage would lift to the reserve lines, forcing troops to shelter or take great risk if they tried to counter attack. Machine guns eventually also played a role in creeping barrages and firing curtains. Effectively, the goal was to fight one line at a time rather than to receive enfilade fire from reserve lines or be overrun by a counter-attack from the second or third line. \n\nGerman troops in 1917 and 1918, partially because of tanks and partially due to these new allied tactics, would scatter from trenches when they came under attack rather than stay in the trench. By spreading out and creating a depth in defense, they undermined the Allied tactics that counted on the trench being the key objective. Now they had to control a zone rather than a single line. A book called *Ring of Steel* in part recounts these decisions by Germans to figure out a way to counter the increasingly effective allied tactics and the men and materiel deficit developing in 1916-17.\n\nIn any event, let\u2019s say they capture the trench. There would generally be counter attacks as soon as things quieted down. Enemy artillery and machine guns would shield infantry as they attempted to recapture the line\/zone they had lost. Ernst Junger\u2019s *Storm of Steel* does a good job illustrating this pretty wild version of the war where you took or lost ground only to come storming back in an effort to retake it.\n\nOne helpful way to imagine the endpoints in the conflict: you begin thinking about cavalry, line firing of massed infantry, and breakthroughs in the enemy line. It's nigh Napoleonic or Civil War thinking (to oversimplify). You end with a combined arms conflict: small groups of 8-16 men forming key teams, aircraft, tanks, and highly organized, planned efforts to pair artillery with their movements.\n\n**Some notes:**\n\nThis is a very significant over simplification, so there are things that you end up not seeing as prominent that played a big role as they came into use, like Lewis Guns (early hand held machine guns), rail guns, and advances in supply and logistics and finance that truly gave the Allies a platform to win the war (Johnson, \"The Munitions War,\" Strachan, *To Arms!*, and Ferguson, \"Paying for the First World War\").\n\nThe Eastern front used trenches, but the geography didn't constrain like the Western Front, so you see significantly more movement and because of the Command of the Russian Army, a lot more random outcomes. (Stone, *The Eastern Front*). They did not necessarily bog down the same way unless their was a siege like as Pryzmesl (Shemeshel) in 1915 (Watson, *The Fortress*).","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1678223964.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1678214592.0}]},{"title":"Have I discovered the meaning behind knights fighting giant snails?

In particular, knights fighting giant snails.\n\nIt's so common across many texts for decades, the study of it apparently even has a name, Medieval Eschargotology?\n\nRandom video about it in case people have never heard of this and think I'm making it up:    https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gWuMFWr-B5g\n\nIt's agreed that no one knows what it's about, but one of the leading theories is that the snails are Lombard knights that the Italian knights (the ones actually drawn as knights) fight and ridicule.\n\nThat's all I knew, and, here comes the part that rang a bell for me...\n\nI got down this rabbit hole by accident, from learning about private military contractors (PMCs), used by Russia and the US today. Modern day mercenaries. The (fantastic) war economics Youtube channel \"PERUN\" made a pronunciation error in his brief summary of historical uses of mercenaries a couple days ago. In German, they're called: \n\n**\"Landsknecht\", or \"Lands\" (land) + \"knecht\" (knight \/ servant).** \"Knight\/Servant of the Land\" = Mercenary. This was a term of pride, unlike how others saw it as derogatory.\n\nSimple enough. But he pronounced it as: \n\n**\"Landschnecke\", moving the 's' to the second word, and creating \"Land\" (land) + \"schnecke\" (snail). \"Land Snail\".** Which, isn't really a word or a term, but, that's what he'd pronounced it as. The German viewers roasted him for it in the comments.\n\nSo in particular when referring to German Mercenaries (Lombards) who had invaded and were a subject of ridicule to the Italians, with an Italian pronunciation (?), the translation becomes \"Land Snails\", and thus, all these Italian knights (or whoever, as Italy wasn't a country) fighting off giant German (Lombardian, as Germany wasn't a country) Land Snails. It's a pun. This is too coincidental for me to believe otherwise without at least asking.\n\nProblems with the theory: I think the term Landsknecht existed until the 1400s maybe? Or is that maybe only in German? Or, could it be a pun from some other time or earlier language and the wordplay is still valid?\n\nOr... is this something everyone already knows and has dismissed and you're irritated with some history know-nothing like me keeps thinking they've come up with something new?\n\nAnyway, thought it humorously coincidental and worth a question.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678110657.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

When and how did giving out stickers after voting in government elections become standard?**\n\nWhen the Nineteenth Amendment passed, while women were _able_ to vote, that does not mean they were immediately turning out in large numbers. \n\nFor one thing, women had to be able to register to vote, and there were barriers to that, like poll taxes and literacy tests. Black women in particular suffered in that respect; for example, in Columbia, South Carolina, over a hundred black women arrived to register in September 1920, and the registrars stalled to have the white women registered first. The women had to return the next day and then got stalled by the literacy test being pulled from the legal code (not the Constitution, as it was supposed to be); the women were unilaterality told they failed the test no matter what the results.\n\nThere was also a legal challenge, as Mary Randolph (who was black) and Cecilia Waters (who was white) both registered to vote in Baltimore, and had their registration challenged in *Leser v. Garnett*. The claim of those suing was that the amendment was not properly ratified, and while the Supreme Court decision was unanimous, this still understandably contributed to a general atmosphere of trying to keep women from voting. Another lawsuit attempting the same, *Fairchild v. Hughes*, saw a private citizen (Fairchild) try a \"public right\" suit; the Supreme Court decided since the suit came from a place where suffrage was already allowed, the claimant had no standing (this term wasn't used exactly -- this was in fact one of the earliest uses of the concept).\n\nAdjoining these more overt tactics is the simple fact of inertia: women who had never voted before were not used to going out and voting. The League of Women Voters (established in 1920 out of older suffrage groups) set out with a mission of education and to bolster the women's vote. They gave out encouraging material and made demonstrations on the actual skills involved in casting a vote (like how to fill a ballot).\n\nThe turnout was poor enough -- 33% in 1920, and not much greater after -- that the question _Is suffrage a failure?_ was openly asked in magazines. Some pounced on the opportunity to characterize women as inherently apolitical. \n\n[This political cartoon](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/hIzfmRL) is from 1926 (\"Let's see, what was it I was going to do when I got into politics?\"). _The Women Citizen_ responded with commentary:\n\n>The artist must have remembered certain glib cure-alls unwisely offered by some of the stump speakers in the campaign for full citizenship ... he has related those problems to the women voter. In his estimation she has fallen down on them.\n\n1926 is also the year, in Texas, [where there was](https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/The_Woman_s_Journal\/holLAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=RA7-PA31&printsec=frontcover):\n\n>...an elaborately planned campaign to get out the vote, under the direction of Miss Mary E. Jagoe, president [of the League of Women Voters]. \"Go to the polls and take one voter with you\" was the slogan. Local Leagues utilized every available agency to increase the number of voters participating in two very interesting primary elections. It was the first time that a Republican primary had been held in Texas.\n\n>Posters were distributed; ballot marking classes were conducted; and some thirty-five slogans, drafted by Miss Jagoe, caught the eye of voters in buses, street cars, shop windows and manufacturing plants. \"I have voted\" tags given out at election booths stimulated last minute voting.\n\nThis is one of the earliest mentions we have record of; while stickers could have shown up earlier in the 1920s, they were more or less exclusively linked to the League of Women Voters up until WWII. Post-WWII, they became more normalized; a [1950 article](https:\/\/www.newspapers.com\/image\/618114799\/?terms=%22I%2BVoted%2Bsticker%22) in Miami mentions \"I have voted\" stickers, and fairly consistent references can be seen after.\n\nThe [specific design](https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2018\/11\/05\/USAT\/876f0d04-8cc3-467c-a300-ee1515eb5b82-votingsticker.jpg) often seen has more to do with capitalism than women's rights. The sticker was designed by Janet Boudreau in 1987 while working for the company Intab, which sold (and still sells) election supplies. Stickers from earlier in the 80s tended to have checkmarks or Xs, an increasingly irrelevant graphic in an era with punch cards. [According to Boudreau herself](https:\/\/www.freep.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2014\/11\/04\/voted-stickers-badge-pride\/18466191\/):\n\n>Rather than copy what was out there already, I wanted to improve it, make it more applicable to any voting system.\n\nHence, her design of pairing \"I voted\" with a flag. It is still copyrighted under the one company. Intab currently sells more than 30 million of the stickers a year.\n\n...\n\n[You can see a chart here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/D8kf6yk) of percentage turnout in the early years of women's voting. The jump in 1928 is generally thought to be because Al Smith, a prominent \"wet\" and Roman Catholic, was running for President, and Prohibition and religion were strong motivating forces.\n\nFitzpatrick, E.

Most of the literature around Han dynasty bureaucracy focuses exclusively on the *Qiangong* (front palace), or the men's bureaucracy, while completely writing off or being ignorant of the *Hougong* (rear palace), or the women's bureaucracy. Within the Han dynasty, there were men's bureaucratic ranks that provided a means to pursue a career path and gain promotions, and crucially, they would be granted land sort of like a retirement fund\/pension. Little known is that the women's bureaucracy also had a system of ranks, and that contrary to most people's images of palace women being sexualized political contests between youthful and beautiful concubines, empress dowagers, etc. the vast majority of palace women were those who served in the women's bureaucracy, and did not provide an overt role in sex. In fact, segregated away from the rest of the empire, they were allowed to create an environment where they could experience a more positive treatment of their femininity, and crucially, with insights gained from excavations at Zhangjiashan, they could obtain land much the same as the men.  \nMost of this comes from Olivia Milburn's  *Palace Women in the Former Han Dynasty (202 BCE\u2013CE 23): Gender and Administrational History in the Early Imperial Era*","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678227852.0},{"author":"TrueSwagformyBois","text":"How much did women\u2019s\u2019 rights actually change post 1789 \/ Revolution in France across the 19th century? \n\nThe Napoleonic Code deals with women fairly harshly, and in contemporary literature, love being expressed as slave\/master relationship seems to have been prevalent.

Besides the fact that I do find it a bit ... odd to project something like anarcho capitalism onto a colony from 1650 it was somewhat interesting. One thing that I found interesting was the claim that Ancadian population (just Europeans) peaked at 16,000. I then read the [paper](https:\/\/www.rcandela.com\/uploads\/2\/0\/1\/6\/20163847\/candela_and_geloso__2021__trade_or_raid.pdf) mentioned on the site to find the source for the population number. It looked at least to my eyes legit. It takes the number of 16,000 from two sources who seem quite old (1968 and 1979).  Besides that I just googled it and found a number on [Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Acadia#Population) (taken from \"La Nouvelle France: The Making of French Canada - A Cultural History\" by Peter M.

Another [source](https:\/\/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca\/en\/article\/history-of-acadia) claims around 10,000 people in Ancadia by 1750. Soooo what is it?\n\nThere are more questions that I have about this piece, mostly how exceptional the described form of self rule in Ancadia really was, whether they were as peaceful as claimed and if yes why (was it as claimed in the paper, or that Ancadia had so much free land that settler aggression like in New England was just not needed?).

I'm thinking specifically of the enormously costly frontal attacks during the Battle of the Frontiers, and fighting under a near-constant artillery barrage at Verdun.\n\nIn contrast, it seems like their sons in 1940 were far less willing to fight. Specifically in the parts regarding the German breakthrough at Sedan, and the subsequent advance towards the Channel, it seems like huge groups of French soldiers surrendered fairly quickly when outflanked (often to numerically smaller German units) without trying to put up a fight, or fled during Stuka-bombardments, no matter how ineffective. During Fall Rot did the French seem to find their fighting spirit, and by then the situation was strategically hopeless.\n\nWas it a question of morale, mentality or training?

Here's a [Web Archive snapshot](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20230221151008\/https:\/\/samkriss.substack.com\/p\/the-secret-history-of-wakanda), and here's the [current published revision](https:\/\/samkriss.substack.com\/p\/the-secret-history-of-wakanda).\n\nI'm here because of a strange inconsistency I saw in a Frantz Fanon quote. This passage is important because the copyright date for Fanon's *Black Skin, White Masks* (1952) predates Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's attributions for Wakanda (1966).\n\nThis is the paragraph leading up to the Fanon quote, going back even farther.\n\n>But the second great Vicinderian revival came from black  Americans. In 1909, the prophet Olumo Bashenga began making speeches in  Chicago, claiming that black Americans were not Negroes, but descendants  of the kings of Vicinder, which he Africanised as Wakanda. In his  mythology, Wakanda was the ancestor of all civilisation, but had hidden  itself away from the world when the colonies it had set up around the  Mediterranean degenerated into \u2018white-pig savagery.\u2019 But one day soon,  Wakanda would reveal itself again, topple the United States of America,  exterminate the misbegotten whites, and forge a new global empire.  Bashenga\u2019s network of \u2018Royal Embassies of the Kingdom of Wakanda\u2019  quickly spread across the United States and the Caribbean. Many black  intellectuals were unconvinced by the movement: WEB Du Bois dismissed  its Wakandan mythology as \u2018unnecessary,\u2019 and Frantz Fanon lands a few  jabs in the final chapter of *Black Skin, White Masks*:\n\nThis is the Fanon quote (my bold):\n\n>It  would be of the greatest interest to be able to have contact with a  **Wakandan** literature or architecture of the third century before Christ. I  should be very happy to know that a correspondence had flourished  between Plato and some **Wakandan** philosopher. But I can absolutely not  see how this fact would change anything in the lives of the  eight-year-old children who labour in the cane fields of Martinique or  Guadeloupe.\n\nI bought *Black Skin, White Masks*, specifically ISBN 978-0-8021-4300-6. I found the passage on page 205. [Here's a photo, linked from Google Drive](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1MXmU7Q0WkIF8n30DSxqFRO-RR4ueudLJ\/view?usp=share_link). I stripped extra EXIF data for privacy, but kept the original resolution. Compare the bolded words to the photographed paragraph. If you cannot see the photo, it shows that the book says \"black\" where the quote says \"Wakandan.\"\n\nI see two possibilities: 1. Sam edited Fanon's passage. 2. The exact book I purchased differs from the one Sam quoted. I didn't see an ISBN or datum to point me to a translation that rules out #2.\n\nI'm here to seek help finding the source of this inconsistency, and to see if there are others. Out of observance of rule #3, I do not expect all work to be done for me. Rather, I am seeking leads to find more targeted information. Thanks in advance for your review.\n\n**Edit**: My earlier bolded text draws attention away from a change in sentence structure. If Google Drive rate limits traffic, also note the example where Kriss' blockquote reads \"I should be very happy to know that a correspondence had flourished between Plato and some Wakandan philosopher.\" The book reads \"We would be overjoyed to learn of the existence of a correspondence between some black philosopher and Plato.\" This doesn't clarify the role of any translator for me, but \"We\" appears frequently in my copy of the book. It's replacement here is also interesting.\n\n**Edit 2**: u\/acinonys pointed me to a r\/rational thread where some commenters identify the essay itself as a fiction\/troll. I remain focused on finding a correct attribution, on the grounds that I didn't intend to take Sam at his word anyway.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678122092.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Not wanting to live in your older brother's shadow for the rest of your life is a pretty consistent and natural response in human history. However, the period surrounding Cyrus the Younger and Artaxerxes II is fascinating, partly just because we know a lot more about it than other periods of Achaemenid Persian history.\n\nThe important thing to note with this question is that Xenophon's *Anabasis* does not tell the whole story. It isn't supposed to. It's the story of the Greek mercenaries, why they were recruited, and what happened to them after Cyrus was killed. It's not a history of Cyrus the Younger. That has to be pieced together from multiple works, including another by Xenophon: the *Hellenika*. The *Hellenika* is literally \"about Greece,\" and covers from 411 BCE and the final years of the Peloponnesian War down to 362 BCE and the end of Theban hegemony. Cyrus the Younger is a very important figure in the first three books of *Hellenika* because of what he was doing before trying to usurp his brother.\n\nAt just 15 or 16 years old, Cyrus the Younger was dispatched to Anatolia to take charge of the Persian alliance with Sparta. He was named the new Satrap of Lydia, but also the \"Karanos.\" Until fairly recently, nobody was really sure what \"Karanos\" meant. It was obviously a title of importance, and seemingly connected to Cyrus' authority to command not just Lydia, but the surrounding provinces of Hellespontine Phrygia and Cappadocia as well. In Greek, it is only ever used in Xenophon's description of Cyrus the Younger. The only other use of the title we knew about before 2012 was for some much later petty kings in Hellenistic Persia who clearly used it in a different context. However, the publication of a collection of Aramaic documents from Achaemenid Bactria in 2012 revealed another Achaemenid leader with the title K*aranaya*, clearly the Aramaic rendering of the same title as Karanos in Greek. It was apparently a sort of military viceroy who could direct military resources across multiple provinces. So that was Cyrus' job at 16.\n\nHis age is immensely important in trying to get a clear picture of Cyrus' personality and motives 2400 years later. Sources for Achaemenid education and age of majority are all from Greek outsiders and very contradictory. However, they all agree that young Persian nobleman finished their education and began to take an active role in government and military command somewhere between 20-25. Xenophon himself actually provides the most detailed description in yet another work, *Cyropaedia*, and says it was 25. So Cyrus the Younger was given a rare and powerful position almost a decade before his peers were eligible for lesser ranks. \n\nIt would not be surprising if Cyrus internalized some of his own supposed grandeur, and there's even one anecdote from Xenophon that might support this. Sometime during his time as Karanos, Cyrus was visited by some of his royal cousins, and had them executed because their hands slipped out from under their sleeves during an official audience with Cyrus. It's a bizarre story. Xenophon typically has nothing but praise for Cyrus, but bothered to include this. We don't know the exact context for this slight, but it is generally inline with other stories of Persian court protocol where even the highest nobility were supposed to show incredible deference to the Great King. The implication may be that Prince Cyrus was already acting like a king while he was in Lydia\n\nThe royal family dynamic is also important. For this, we also have to bring in another source: Ctesias' *Persika*. Unfortunately the actual text of the *Persika* is lost, but Ctesias was heavily quoted and cited by Plutarch in his *Life of Artaxerxes* and an epitome of Ctesias by the 9th Century Byzantine Patriarch Photios survives. Ctesias is generally seen as a dubious source for most of Persian history, recounting court rumors, propaganda, and the most salacious version of any story he came across without critique. However, his storytelling is greatly tempered in the final sections describing the reigns of Darius II and Artaxerxes II, likely because he was actually there.\n\nCtesias was a Greek physician who arrived in Persia sometime near the end of Darius' reign, either as a captive or freely, we just don't know. He became Parysatis' personal doctor, lived at court, and even treated Artaxerxes' wounds during the Battle of Cunaxa. Most importantly for this answer, he told the story of Terituchmes, the Satrap of Armenia. Terituchmes' father, Hydarnes, allied himself with Darius II during Darius' own war for succession in 424 BCE. In exchange for Hydarnes' support, Darius arranged marriages between their children. Terithuchmes married the princess Amestris, while his sister Stateira married the future Artaxerxes II. When Terituchmes' rebelled, he murdered Amestris, and when that rebellion was put down, Parysatis wanted to take revenge by wiping out the whole rebel family, including Stateira. Artaxerxes had to beg his father to intervene and Darius ordered Parysatis to stand down, but it was the beginning of eventually fatal discord between Parysatis and Stateira.\n\nWe also need to acknowledge the massive age gap between Artaxerxes and Cyrus. Plutarch says Artaxerxes died at 78 years old. Polybius, citing a now-lost historian called Deinon who lived at the end of Artaxerxes' reign, says that Artaxerxes lived to 95. Cyrus, on the other hand, was born after Darius II became king in 424. They were 10-20 years apart, and thus not likely to be very familiar, or even know each other well. Depending on how wide the age gap was, by the time Cyrus could form real memories, Artaxerxes may already have been governing a Satrapy on his own. Meanwhile, Cyrus was raised around his mother and her allies at court, along with any biases against Artaxerxes and Stateira that they brought to the table.\n\nFinally, there's an issue of Persian succession law. We know very little with certainty, and too many kings and princes were assassinated to point to any certain trends. However, four disputed successions (Xerxes, Darius II, Artaxerxes II, and Artaxerxes III) all either have evidence to suggest or sources directly stating that there was a debate over whether the eldest son was heir with straightforward primogeniture or if the first son born after the king's coronation was the true heir, favoring porphyrogeniture.\n\nThe only time where that actually played out definitively is in the transition from Darius I to Xerxes I, where Xerxes was chosen as heir over his elder half-brothers, but that was also a unique case. Darius came to power in a coup, and even in his own extremely strained propaganda only claimed to be a 4th cousin of the Empires founder, Cyrus the Great. To solidify the line of succession, he married all of the female descendants of Cyrus, and Xerxes was the first child by one of those wives, Atossa. \n\nChoosing Xerxes ensured dynastic continuity on both sides of his bloodline, but later debates like Cyrus vs Artaxerxes were a question of whether or not their father had to be king, or if being the son of a prince was royal enough for succession. The Great Kings after Darius I all seem to have favored unconditional primogeniture, but ambitious younger sons like Cyrus the Younger could lean on the precedent set by Xerxes to push their own claims for power. Ctesias reports that this was one of Parysatis' arguments when she advocated for Cyrus in Darius II's last few weeks of life.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1678211969.0}]},{"title":"I'm a minor southern French noble in the 18th century, do I actually care that the king is marrying an Austrian?","author":"FlammeEternelle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11kvdk7\/im_a_minor_southern_french_noble_in_the_18th\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678184141.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Dr Walker has been mining whaling ship logbooks for climate data to analyze climate change in a joint project with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and University of Massachusetts. He noted that many logbooks identified areas with good fishing, including the types of fish, so that ships could revisit them in the future. A cool side note is that these logbooks could also be used to track historic migratory patterns of different fish.\n\nYou can see this firsthand in digitized whaling logbooks.

But all four gospels include the offering of a drink that is called, in Greek, \u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 ('oxos'). \n\nIn Latin \u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 was called acetum. Literally it meant \"vinegar\", but it was often used somewhat fluidly. Vinegar was made from old wine that had soured, and could be \"recycled\" by allowing it to sour further into true vinegar. Thus \u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 could refer to either true vinegar, or to old\/soured\/souring wine. Sometimes it was used metaphorically to refer simply to inferior wines. Some writers were much more precise between \"vinegared wine\" and true vinegar, but many wouldn't be (and of course the unrefined Koine Greek of the Gospels would be unlikely to be precise).\n\nTrue vinegar was a medicinal product. It was a common ingredient in many medicines, and on its own it was very useful for bleeding wounds. As Dioscorides says in *De medica materia V.13*:\n\n\"Vinegar cools and contracts...it staunches all hemorrhages when drunk...it treats bleeding wounds and inflammations when applied with greasy wool or sponges.\n\nThus one could plausibly speculate that the \u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 was offered to Jesus to help him with his bleeding wounds. This may not have been a mercy however; as crucifixion was intended as a slow death by exposure and exhaustion\/suffocation, and Jesus' bleeding wounds would have hastened his death.\n\nYet this doesn't match the context of the gospel narrative. Luke implies that the soldiers gave it to Jesus as part of their \"mocking\" him as \"King of the Jews\".  This is very different from the other gospels, which present the mocking incident as earlier, and the drink offered as part of the mocking was wine mixed with \u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2 or \u03c3\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03c9. The first means \"bitter\" and could be used to refer to any bitter substance, including myrrh, while the second refers specifically to myrrh. \n\nUnlike the traditional explanation that this was intended as pain relief (myrrh doesn't actually have any significant pain-relieving properties), this was actually a very expensive aromatic wine, and so was most likely a similar prop to the purple cloak and crown, also used to mock his popular title of \"King of the Jews\". ([See my post on this subject here](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/AcademicBiblical\/comments\/11kn6ln\/according_to_mark_1523_the_crucified_jesus_was\/jb9ifsm\/)).\n\nThis is, of course, a direct reference to the messianic verse, Psalm 69:21: \n\n>They gave me poison (\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd) for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar (\u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2) to drink.\n\nI've indicated the Greek words used in the Septuagint above, as this was the version of the Old Testament used by the New Testament authors, not the Hebrew text. \n\nAs the gospels disagree on this point, and the incident is doubled in Matthew and Mark, a common sign of harmonising two separate traditions, it is likely that the drink offered in the original tradition was indeed only \u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2, but it is hard to say whether it was part of the mocking or intended to help him.\n\nFor all other gospels, Jesus is offered the \u1f44\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 after the mocking. While John is explicit that it is offered in response to Jesus saying he's thirsty, Matthew and Mark only have it given to him \"to drink\", which may fit either a drink intended for thirst or for medicine. Yet a drink certainly seems more likely.\n\nIf this was a drink then it wouldn't have been vinegar proper. It would have been either sour\/souring wine or simply poor quality wine. \n\nIt is possible that this term was used imprecisely as a reference to posca. This was a common low-quality drink made from heavily diluted vinegar flavoured with herbs. It was known as both a drink drunk by the urban poor, soldiers on strict rations, and by pretentious aristocrats who wanted to show off how aesthetically austere they were, such as Cato the Elder. Diluted vinegar drinks such as posca were more properly called \u1f40\u03be\u03c5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd in Greek (or \u1f40\u03be\u1f7b\u00b5\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\/\u1f40\u03be\u03c5\u00b5\u03b5\u03bb\u1f77\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd when mixed with honey). But as noted above, the Gospel writers are not known for their precision in their language. So it is possible they were referring to this kind of drink.\n\nSo, it is unclear what was intended here, and this is reflected in the different ways the Gospel writers interpreted the tradition. Luke interpreted this as part of the mocking, and so may well have understood it as true vinegar, fit only for medicine, not for thirst. The other Gospel writers however, John most explicitly, understood it as a simple commoner's drink, intended as a cheap thirst-quencher for the lower classes.\n\n**Sources:**  \nCollins, Adela Yarbro, *Mark: A Commentary (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible)*, Fortress Press, 2007\n\nMudd, Shaun Anthony, Constructive Drinking in the Roman Empire, PhD Thesis, University of Exeter, 2015","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1678454455.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678086915.0}]},{"title":"Has a United States President ever made a public statement on or participated in \u201cReformation Day\u201d celebrations?","author":"AnOkFella","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11kud1z\/has_a_united_states_president_ever_made_a_public\/","text":"Additionally, has there ever been a significant statement made by a 19th, 20th, or 21st century president that is fond of the Protestant reformation as a general event? \n\nHow about any statement regarding Martin Luther or the early reformers?\n\nHow were these actions regarded by the populous if there were such statements?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678180562.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Tottle, even if he had the best intentions when writing his book (which I doubt), could not have published a proper book about the Holodomor if he tried \u2013 and he did not try, as he does not make sufficient use of even the sources that were available at the time he was writing, most notably foreign diplomatic dispatches.\n\nIf you want to see serious historical work arguing against the genocide position (and, in fact, the dismissal of premeditated genocide is the dominant position in Holodomor historiography), \"The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931\u20131933\" by Davies and Wheatcroft (2004) is still in my impression a standard work (I invite my colleagues to correct me).\n\nIf you want some interesting recent snippets in the form of easier-to-digest journal articles, I've been a big fan of the historical demography work done by Ukrainian demographer Oleh Wolowyna (\"Regional 1932\u20131933 Famine Losses: A Comparative Analysis of Ukraine and Russia\", 2020; \"Monthly Distribution of 1933 Famine Losses in Soviet Ukraine and Russian Soviet Republic at the Regional Level\", 2020; \"Regional variations of 1932\u201334 famine losses in Ukraine, 2017), which does not immediately force upon you any conclusion (although Wolowyna is himself a soft skeptic of the genocide thesis), but will provide crucial data on the internal geographic distribution of famine deaths between the UkSSR and the RSFSR, as well as the rural-urban divide. The latter is especially important: In the Holodomor, rural victims far outnumbered urban victims (3M+ versus 250k), but this is the exact opposite of how we would expect a 'natural famine' to work: Normally, cities starve faster, and urbanites flee to the countryside in search of food, but the Holodomor reversed that trend, with cities having food and people from the countryside trying to flee to the cities (and being stopped by internal Soviet security forces through the practices of road blocks, raion-based \"black lists\" and internal passports).\n\nAs regards wartime Nazi propaganda: Publications about the Holodomor precede 1941 (see Alexander Wienerberger's Austrian-published photographs, for example, which is one of the few surviving photographic sets of evidence \u2013 you will frequently find Wienerberger's two dozen or so photos on Wikipedia, for instance). Ewald Ammende published \"Human Life in Russia\" in 1936 (which, admittedly, was published in Germany, so I suppose this is not helping my case), and newspapers around the world reported with some regularity of the famine conditions.\n\nBut there was someone even better informed that foreign journalists: diplomats in the Soviet Union.\n\nPaolo Fonzi published a stellar journal article in the *Nationalities Papers* in 2019, titled \"Non-Soviet Perspectives on the Great Famine: A Comparative Analysis of British, Italian, Polish, and German Sources\". Drawing from the mentioned four countries' diplomatic papers, Fonzi lays out the impression of the diplomats and envoys in their Moscow embassies, and some even in consulates in Ukraine (typically in Kyiv or Kharkiv). You will find that not only did the Germans not fabricate the Holodomor, they were actually quite friendly to the Soviet government in their interpretation of the suffering peasantry as lazy:\n\n> In German sources there are many such statements [of bigotry against the peasantry]. For instance, the German consul in Kharkiv wrote in December 1933 that one of the causes of the famine was that the Soviet leadership had overlooked the fact that \u201caccording to Stalin\u2019s words \u2018the men decide over the thing\u2019 and the question whether the 22 million Ukrainian peasants would follow him and they would show understanding and collaboration for the new collective economic form instead of their deeply rooted individualistic ideology.\u201d Von Dirksen\u2019s successor, Ambassador Rudolf Nadolny, went so far as to see in Soviet collectivization the only way to \u201clead the enormous gray mass of the Russian people out of the rigidity of stagnation and put it into progressive motion towards a higher degree of development.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Polish diplomats, whom Fonzi dubs as second-best informed about Soviet affairs (behind only the Germans), take a much stronger role of Holodomor condemnation, interpreting peasant resistance inspired by government-inflicted abuse as a major contributing factor:\n\n> Likewise, Polish diplomats saw in the resistance of the peasants to forced collectivization a key causal factor of the famine. In a report from September 1932, the Polish Consul in Kyiv, besides stressing the role of economic and technical factors, pointed out that, in the Kyiv, Vinnitsa, and Odessa areas, great damage to crop harvest was caused by passive resistance on the part of the peasants. The following sentences summed up what the consul believed to be the motivation of the Ukrainian peasants:\n>>Russia completely disregards the interests and the population of Ukraine, it strips it completely of bread. Currently we do not have any means to counter this [policy]. Only passive sabotage remains, which, although it may cause hunger and lack of bread in Ukraine, may, however, contribute to creating serious difficulties or even to the collapse of the existing system.\n\nBut we won't hear much about Josef Pilsudski personally faking the Holodomor, I suppose...\n\nAlso, get out of cringe online spaces, kids.","upvotes":203,"created_utc":1678120379.0},{"author":"Zhein","text":"A quick search on the wiki gives us  [an answer from \/u\/Kochevnik81](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/b3e0xo\/how_isnt_the_holodomor_not_a_genocide\/), and as he states : \"no serious historians will argue that it was a famine caused by natural factors alone\"","upvotes":65,"created_utc":1678108460.0},{"author":"DanKensington","text":"Whether one should approach the Holodomor with a lens of genocide is still an unresolved question in academia.

Tottle's book, which I reference in my original post, follows that line to a T, so it's not surprising that the spaces you were in were recommending it: it's pure Soviet apologetics (for an example of his willingness to follow the Soviet line no matter how absurd, on p. 71 he repeats the then-standard pro-Soviet reasoning that Korean Air Flight 007, shot down by the Soviets in 1983 with the loss of 269 lives after it drifted into Soviet airspace, was actually on a spy mission and this was being covered up by the US).  Anne Appelbaum claims that \"The Institute of Party History in both Moscow and Kyiv contributed to Tottle\u2019s manuscript; unsigned versions were sent back and forth between their offices and those of the two party Central Committees for corrections and commentary. Soviet diplomats followed the book\u2019s publication and progress, and they promoted it where they could.\" (Source: Liudmyla Hrynevych).\n\nThe heart of the book's argument can be boiled down to \"Nazis had an obvious interest in smearing the Soviet Union, their attacks on the Soviets were picked up and spread by elements of an also hostile (and uncritical) capitalist West, significant element of the post-WWII Ukrainian diaspora was hard-right in nature, these diaspora elements had a distinct interest in playing up the 'murderous Soviet regime' angle that coincided with the West's agenda and are often exaggerated or outright incorrect in their charges, and lastly, some of the photos used in coverage of the famine were actually from earlier famines.\"  He also points out that those arguing for a uniquely Ukrainian famine ignore the deaths amongst Kazakhs and Russians in this period.\n\nThe above is all correct (though he gets some of the details wrong), and if you had no further background in the famine you might be forgiven for thinking that Tottle's book had some weight.  His attacks on elements of the Ukrainian diaspora--in particular, their at-times shoddy scholarship and desire to ensure that the famine had more reported victims than the Holocaust--are effective if sometimes distorted themselves.\n\nBut Chapter Eight, where he goes over to attempting to explain the \"real\" causes of the famine, is more troublesome.  He unequivocally states that there was a famine, but quotes sources stating that the \"kulaks\", the more well-to-do peasants, were the ones who actually caused it through self-sabotage in response to collectivization, and that there were cases where the stubborn peasantry refused to harvest grain (presumably to spite the Soviets), and that ethnic Ukrainian party officials were overzealous \/ incompetent; in other words, the Ukrainians did it to themselves (pp. 93-96).  Another quoted source (pp. 96-97) claims that it was disease that actually claimed most lives, leaving one to think that it was just bad luck that outbreaks struck at that time.  He ends the chapter with a smattering of pro-Soviet propaganda regarding its industrial production and wartime record.  There are vague allusions to Soviet \"problems\", \"excesses\", \"difficulties\", \"confusion\" and \"mistakes\", but overall the Soviet Union comes off as doing the best it can in pursuit of a noble goal and the famine just sort of happened despite the communists' best intentions.  It's not exactly convincing stuff and in many cases is completely contradicted by modern scholarship.\n\nSimilarly, Chapters Nine and Ten are dedicated to establishing the Nazi bonafides of exile Ukrainians, with the argument that basically everyone arguing for the famine-genocide line is either a Nazi or a Nazi accomplice (an argument no doubt familiar to you: it's become the bog-standard approach amongst certain elements at this point).  It wasn't true in 1987; it's not even remotely accurate 35 years later.\n\nTottle, who was not a historian, is writing in a period where the regime most interested in painting the famine in the best light possible was sponsoring efforts such as his book to do so.  Additionally, that same regime had not yet opened up its archives, meaning that meaningful attempts to understand the famine--its causes, the interaction and weight of various elements involved, the actual death toll--were impossible at the time.  If you're looking for a genuine scholarly effort, you'll want to skip Cold War-era 35-year-old pre-archival \"scholarship\" written by a pro-Soviet trade unionist and backed by Moscow; I'd echo ted5298 in pointing you instead to \"The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931\u20131933\" by Davies and Wheatcroft (2004), which I also mention in my linked post.\n\nGood luck trying to untangle this thread: it's a thoroughly poisoned intellectual space and requires a great deal of effort to find your way through it all.","upvotes":39,"created_utc":1678125643.0},{"author":"MumboJumbo947","text":"Coming as someone who was once won over by the Marxist Leninist position, and FF&F as well, I can tell you that the book is a fantastic example of false herring narrative.\nVery little that he states in the book is technically wrong, he just always presents it in a way that appears damning.\n\nTake the Thomas Walker affair at the beginning of the book, it's presented as this big thing that was a huge unveiling of the famine, and its immediate refutations proved it to be the propaganda that it was.\n\nBut...

Additionally, Tottle's \"*Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard*\" is not a reliable historical text as it was written by a pro-Soviet activist to exculpate the USSR from responsibility. There is not a single serious historian working today that absolves the USSR of all culpability.\n\nAlthough I do think it may be helpful to explain where these kinds of claims come from. The famines absolutely happened, although we are not just looking at an historical event but at how historical events become collectively remembered by victims. Collective memory can become a contested space with competing visions that are entangled with political and national interests, and the Holodomor is no exception. The emergence of the Holodomor as a historical narrative was bound-up with post-Soviet Ukrainian nation-making that cannot be neatly separated from the legacy of Eastern European anti-Semitism, or what Historian Peter Novick calls \"Holocaust Envy,\" the desire for victimized  groups to enshrine their \"own\" Holocaust or Holocaust-like event in the historical record.  For many nationalists, this has entailed minimizing the Holocaust in service of elevating their own experiences of historical victimization as the supreme atrocity. The Ukrainian scholar Lubomyr Luciuk exemplified this view in his notorious remark that the Holodomor was \u201ca crime against humanity arguably without parallel in European history.\u201d This competitive victimhood has even manifested in the depictions of the Jews as causing the famine or benefiting from it, either directly or indirectly. This was a pervasive sentiment in Nazi occupied Ukraine and persisted within Ukrainian nationalist movements.\n\nIn War-time Soviet Ukraine, Nazi occupiers promoted  awareness around the catastrophic famines, but only to pin them on the Jews as a way of facilitating local Nazi collaboration. Historian Karel Berkhoff notes how the Nazi Press proliferated anti-Semitic messaging about the famines in his text *The Great Famine in Light of the German Invasion and Occupation*. For instance, one newspaper noted how \u201c\u2018Jews lacked neither gold nor dollars' ' to be affected by the famines and others described Bolshevism as an inherently Jewish project. Berkhoff describes another instance where locals were shown a propaganda film depicting the mass death of the famines, which ended with Jewish policemen being killed in retaliation.\n\nFrom 1929 and onwards, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), a Ukrainian ultranationalist terrorist group also advocated this messaging. This group perpetrated reprehensible violence and racial terror against Jews and justified these atrocities on the grounds that the Jews were the primary actors in the Russian Revolution and therefore Bolshevism was a Jewish ideology. Nor is this belief limited to militant groups. I won\u2019t wade into this due to the 20 year rule, but Jaquelin Coulson has described the many ways in which anti-Semitic interpretations of the 1930s famine have been taken up by prominent post-Soviet Ukrainian politicians and figures, and enshrined in state documents. We know now that the 1930s famine affected more nations that just Ukraine, but anti-Semitic nationalist hardliners have sought to \u201cethnicize\u201d the event by rendering Ukrainians as the exclusive and primary victims of a genocide perpetrated by a Jewish \u201cOther.\u201d  Ukraine\u2019s National Museum contains within it the National Books of Memory, a solemn display which memorializes the victim the famine; however, Coulson notes how victim testimonies have also been selected in a way to convey an anti-Semitic attitudes:\n\n>Without explicit accusations leveled by the editors, the National Books of Memory also portray Jews in a decidedly unsavory light. Featured prominently were testimonies recalling Jewish-run stores which \u201cpumped gold and silver from the people\u201d of Ukraine in exchange for desperately-needed food, suggesting that this is \u201cfrom where the Jews have such large resources.\u201d The carefully chosen testimonials ultimately suggest that it was the Jews \u201cwho fleeced Ukraine \\[and\\] drove its people to the grave.\n\nAssigning blame to Jews for the Holodomor is done in part to deflect from  local Ukrainian participation in the Holocaust. Prominent Ukrainian nationalist figures llike Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych, were virulently anti-semitic murderers, yet, as historian John-Paul Himka has noted, have been celebrated as national folk heroes. Michael Shakir describes this phenomenon as deflective negationism:\n\n>Rather than negating the Holocaust, deflective negation transfers the guilt for the perpetration of crimes onto members of other nations, or it minimizes own-nation participation in their perpetration to insignificant \u2018aberrations\u2019\n\nTo be clear, this is not exclusive to Ukraine and the belief that local participation within the Holocaust was a justified reaction towards \u201cJudeo-Bolshevisim\u201d is one that has a disturbing popularity in Eastern Europe.\n\nAs for the 1930s status as a genocide, Soviet specialist J Arch Getty sums it up best when he wrote: \u201cSimilarly, the overwhelming weight of opinion among scholars working in the new archives is that the terrible famine of the 1930s was the result of Stalinist bungling and rigidity rather than some genocidal plan.\u201d Likewise, Davies and Wheatcroft, who have written the most authoritative account on the famines, have written: \u201cHowever, we have found no evidence, either direct or indirect, that Stalin sought deliberately to starve the peasants.\u201d\n\nStalin cannot be absolved from responsibility due to his callous and brutal policy decision-making, but it was not a genocide. Wheatcroft has noted how the push to have the famines recognized as a genocide has marked a turn away from critical economic and social scientific explanations of complex food problems, an assessment I agree with.\n\nHimka, John-Paul.

He himself considered himself a novelist. He did not use commonly-enforced research and writing standards\u2014like footnotes\u2014and his work promotes the \"lost cause\" narrative of Civil War History that suggests the Civil War was not primarily caused by slavery. To his credit, Foote acknowledged slavery played a part, but that it was just that, a piece of a bigger picture. The reality is, though, the primary cause of the Civil War was the sectional crisis and the tensions that grew over slavery. Simply put, slavery was the essential core of all the tension.  \n\nTensions go all the way back to the founding of the country and the three-fifths clause of the Constitution. During the writing of the Constitution, northern and southern interests could not agree on the status of the enslaved when it came to representation in congress and taxes owed. Northerners did not want the enslaved population to count as that would allow southerners to have more representatives in Congress and consequently a greater sway in the election of the president through the electoral college. Most northern states had also started taking steps to free enslaved populations. These were very flawed and limited. Slavery would exist in the North well into the nineteenth century. But they nonetheless were signalling a move away from the institution. Southerners, for the same reasons, wanted the enslaved to count. Their economy and society was built and partially dependent on black enslavement, especially states like South Carolina. The issue was solved by literally counting the enslaved as 3\/5s of a person. You can learn more about the 3\/5 compromise [here](https:\/\/www.theusconstitution.org\/news\/understanding-the-three-fifths-compromise\/). \n\nThis was one of the first instances of what abolitionists of the time called the \"slave power conspiracy,\" the idea that there was a conspiracy within the government to promote a literal slaveocracy. Whether or not such a conspiracy existed isn't as important as the fact that many northerners believed it. And in truth, the 3\/5s compromise gave southern slave-holding interests a decided advantage in dictating national politics. 12 of the first 18 presidents were slaveholders and southerners managed to occupy key positions of power in the government to ensure the protection of the institution. Matthew Karp's \"This Vast Southern Empire\" contributes a good deal to this argument. \n\nThroughout the rest of the eighteenth and into the nineteenth century, several events came to pass that made slavery a more prominent national issue and source of regional divide. The invention of the Cotton Gin at the end of the eighteenth century reinvigorated southern slavery that had been on the decline and encouraged vast western expansion in the south to profit off of cotton. With cotton moving west, so too did slavery. All the while, efforts were made to ensure southern interests were secured. The Missouri Compromise, which forced free and slave states to enter the union together ensured that the Senate would maintain parity, and thus ensured southern slavery remained protected. It also created tension, and sometimes violence in the case of \"Bleeding Kansas,\" as to whether a new state would be free or slave. Southern congressmen even introduced the \"gag rule\" that prohibited the discussion of slavery on the floors of congress. \n\nWhile these and other developments were occurring, you also see the rise of abolitionism, the underground railroad, and free labor. Abolitionists had been around since the well before the antebellum era. The American Revolution was actually a great boon for abolitionism as black Americans highlighted the hypocrisy of a populace winning independence from \"tyranny\" while promoting slavery. It is also important to realize the first and most fervent abolitionists were African Americans themselves. But during the early-nineteenth century tensions were growing due to the factors I mentioned. Abolitionists began becoming more vocal and radical. William Lloyd garrison published the liberator, Frederick Douglass went on speaking tours throughout the country, and John Brown plotted and carried out domestic terrorism in the name of abolition. At the same time, the underground railroad was picking up as a decentralized network of connections worked to help enslaved people escape to the \"free\" North. This particularly infuriated southern slave owners who were usually cash poor. Many southerners continued to invest in slave labor and therefore fugitives were real financial impact. Meanwhile, the concept of \"free labor\" began to take hold in the North. This was the notion that progress and growth was best achieved by labor done by free individuals who could work for their own advancement. As such, the question over western expansion became much more volatile as northerners began to see \"free labor\" as the best cause for the country and new territory. \n\nAs the nineteenth century progressed, tensions grew. \"Bleeding Kansas\" saw violence erupt over states being free or slave. Abolitionists became more radical. And perhaps most significantly, the fugitive slave act that was passed in 1850 emboldened southern slave catchers to go into northern states and abduct fugitives. The law was even so written as to force northerners to aid these slave catchers under penalty of imprisonment. This only made tensions worse and worked to unite the North under the banner of \"free labor.\" Another important thing happened in the 1850s with the collapse of the Whig party and the rise of the Republican party. Political parties had more or less been split on slavery along regional lines. But the Republican party came into the picture as an anti-slavery \"free labor\" party. This caused a realignment that for the first time got the North on the same page on an issue and in the same party. This was viewed as a threat by southern slaveholders. Consequently, when Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860, without a single southern electoral vote, the secession crisis began. \n\nSo maybe you could from one angle call the cause of the Civil War a failure to compromise...but it was a failure to compromise on the issue of slavery. If you still need more support, take the words of the Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Hamilton Stevens, for what he thought the causes of the Civil War were. \"Our new government is founded upon...its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.\" The war was caused by slavery. They knew it then, it is still the case now. The reason it's a question is the lost cause ideology that accompanied the failure of reconstruction and the scholarship of Confederate sympathizers like UB Phillips taking hold, but that's a whole different topic altogether. I hope this answered your question.","upvotes":47,"created_utc":1678152119.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678157124.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678211327.0}]},{"title":"Why does the USA have no labour\/trade union party when the UK, Australia and New Zealand do?","author":"--CJED--","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11jonqm\/why_does_the_usa_have_no_labourtrade_union_party\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678077884.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

That said: if you drill down on that site you can see that the 1920's spike is almost entirely due to their category \"drought\" in 1928.  This likely corresponds to the Chinese famines of 1928-1930, which in reality spread over multiple years and is estimated at closer to 6 million dead.\n\nBecause of the limited time window this site provides, you're also not seeing that in 1906-1907, China was struck by massive famine and floods killing nearly 25 million, dwarfing the \"spike\" you're seeing.  Not to minimize the later famines by any means!   But sometimes a spike is misleading, if you're looking at a subset of the data.\n\nNote that the definition of \"natural disaster\" varies.   Many exclude the effects of famine or disease, and those two are among the largest episodic killers.   \n\nSome include famine only if directly tied to a phenomena like drought.  In modern times famine usually has a political or man-made component, because modern food storage and transport usually means a surplus EXISTS.  But sometimes it cannot reach the people who need it, due to economics, war, or deliberate blockage.\n\nIf you're looking for trends or spikes or inflection points in natural disasters, you'll need to define your terms and try to find data that matches your intent.

Consequently, to talk about paper as having a standard size is a bit anachronistic, but that doesn't mean there weren't norms.\n\nFolio and quarto describe the number of folds a sheet of paper has undergone in a book, as opposed to its size. Some lists of paper sizes use language like foolscap folio, kings quarto and post octavo, but that implies a greater correspondence to book size than really existed. By virtue of the fact paper producers tended to produce sheets of similar size, foolscap might be a useful if imprecise way of naming the largest regular size of sheet paper, but it doesn't acknowledge the fact that there wasn't an exact standard in paper sizing. \n\nSo, how big was a 'standard' bit of writing paper? The answer is that paper producers would usually cut sheets from the quire of a size which would produce something around 13.5x16.5in. Most paper was used for printing, and therefore it was mostly cut large with the expectation that the printer would fold it several times over for books. Other papers might be sold by the printer from the paper they buy, or by stationers who would have paper cut to a preferred size. There are good records of stationers asking for paper to be cut to various sizes from the paper mill, but most writing paper was either 8x13in or 6.5x8in. Again, to talk about exact standards here is misleading, and if you ordered directly from a mill you could have paper cut to a much broader range of sizes, and plenty of letters are not in the sizes I listed above.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1678177262.0}]},{"title":"The new weekly theme is: Women's rights!","author":"AlanSnooring","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair:Women's+rights","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678100478.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Is prostitution world\u2019s oldest profession?","author":"aeakinoglu","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11l57fl\/is_prostitution_worlds_oldest_profession\/","text":"I was watching HIMYM and they said this.

His writing is often assailed for its shortcomings by twenty-first-century standards, but for the time, his work can be regarded as typical. The relevant quote as presented in [an article in Slate](https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2012\/03\/rush-limbaugh-calls-sandra-fluke-a-prostitute-is-prostitution-really-the-worlds-oldest-profession.html) (2012) is the opening line: \u201cLalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world,\u201d from [On the City Wall](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=ZhAPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA135&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false), a short story published in 1899. \n\nGiven this context, Kipling was assuming his readers would understand his meaning without using more direct words to refer to sex workers. This suggests that the phrase may have been floating around in oral tradition, but I cannot find an earlier reference to it, so I\/we can't be sure. Kipling may or may not have invented it.\n\nThe problem with this assertion rests in a lack of evidence (whatever first transactions occurred in whatever profession, the events date to an undocumented prehistory); in addition, there is the problem with what is meant by \"profession.\" Without exploring and agreeing upon a definition, we are likely to come to the table with different assumptions about meaning.\n\nAny assertion about this or that profession dating to any specific time in prehistory is absurd. We simply don't know and can only make indirect guesses using archaeology or some sort of intellectual parlor game to imagine what occurred first and when it started occurring. Good luck with that exercise. It will lead to nowhere certain!\n\nAll this said, we invariably return to this word \"profession.\" What does it mean? Does it mean a trade of service for something, or does it mean the purchase of a service with money? The idea of the exchange of sex for something is grounded in a sexist notion that prehistoric women were waiting at home for the hunter to return with meat, and the hunter, meat in hand, traded his commodity for sex.\n\nThis is an absurd imaginary scenario since no one was sitting around waiting for hunters to return: everyone who was able had a task to complete. One could just as easily argue that returning hunters (male or female) were exchanging sexual services for the various things being done at the homebase: the tanning of hides, the fashioning of baskets, the gathering of foodstuffs, etc.\n\nThe question then comes around to when did people develop specialized tasks and expertise and when were these traded for commodities or services. Is this what we mean by profession? It seems to me that this is a good definition, but others might not agree.\n\nThere is very early archaeological evidence of people trading goods, from group to group. Did the gathering of these commodities and the moving of these commodities to trading locations represent the emergence of a profession? Perhaps. Again, this is a combination of developing a definition for the abstraction of \"profession\" and engaging in a parlor game of what came first.\n\nIf we go back to the purchase of something with money, we find that the earliest records document all sorts of things being purchased, but mostly this involves various commodities. Does this make baking, farming, mining, or any number of other things early professions? Perhaps. Whatever came first cannot be known based on the earliest documentation. The earliest documentation is not the beginning: whatever was first documented almost certainly occurred before that documentation, so we are back to speculating about prehistory with our parlor game.\n\nEven with this parlor game, however, there is no reason to imagine that sex work was the earliest of whatever we can call a profession. This notion gains energy in part because sex is so fundamental to life, and being primal, it is easy to imagine that it is at the beginning. It was, after all, \"at the beginning\" in some sense, but the idea that it was the first thing purchased with traded items or coin is undocumented and hard to imagine.\n\nEdited for some clunky writing! Writing, by the way, was not the first profession.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1678217542.0},{"author":"vampirecloud","text":"Many sources will say it is but I find that fact to be misogynistic.

My qualifications are uni as a mechanical engineer with some experience with the tech in other applications. But, as nobody else has answered, I thought I'd give a shot.\n\nSo, in terms of the science, I'm mostly going to be talking about radar, as that's what my knowledge is mostly on.\n\nVery simply, from an external view, it's really hard to tell from an outside view what parts of a structure are solid, esprcially when youre not sure how much the builder knew was structurally required, and especially in the giant architecture of ancient egypt. And, when there might be several gaps, cracks, or non-regular internal architecture that makes ground penetrating radar return incorrectly or not at all. A lot of work goes into filtering out those exact issues with use in archeology. \n\nAdditionally, as I imagine this question was piqued by the recent access of that hidden chamber in Egypt, another problem is getting to it. That chamber was doscovered in 2017, and only now accessed in 2023 with the use of relatively modern technology. Simply put, it's really fucking hard to get into a lot of these places, especially when youre not totally use that tearing down a wall wont collapse the structure. The corridor in this case was from my understanding a purely structural chamber located above a regular chamber, so it was basically just an air gap above the ceiling until the roof closed over to form a more structurally sound and lighter weight triangular shape. So that weight wasnt distributed along the ceiling. There was no door\/natural access to the area.\n\nSo together, it basically boils down to the imaging process has a LOT of noise, and it takes a lot of work to process and go through it. However, it also means you might not actually be able to find a room without a certain angle, depending on internal structural details. This corridor may find another, who knows. And then once you find it, how do you get to it without blasting charges or pickaxes?\n\n\nSource:\n\nGround-penetrating radar survey at the pyramid complex of Senwosret III at Dahshur, Egypt, 2008: search for the lost boat of a Pharaoh","upvotes":226,"created_utc":1678086168.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":160,"created_utc":1678030977.0},{"author":"ColCrabs","text":"**Part 1**\n\nI want to add in a bit of information on some of the methodological and institutional limitations of these types of projects from an archaeologist. There are dozens of limitations. I do want to point out, I don't know how much of the pyramid itself has been studied and how much of the estimated possible space has been studied.  It could be that 99% of the spaces are known and are in some state of research or analysis but we only see the most sensationalized accounts.\n\n1. **Fragmentation -**   Archaeology is essentially a different discipline within each country and even within each country it can differ greatly.  There isn't a lot of work on this but if anyone is keen on seeing some of the differences you can look at the [*Discovering the Archaeologists of Europe*](https:\/\/landward.eu\/disco\/) survey from 2014. It's mostly superficial but gets at the broader part of the problem.  There are differences at the most basic levels of archaeology, our methods, theories, tools and technologies, even the definition of what archaeology is.  This makes it difficult to collaborate on a larger scale and collaborate internationally, get proper funding, overcome limitations like health and safety, and limits our accessibility to new technologies. Any project will find it difficult to get access to new or innovative technologies like this, even if it is the pyramids.\n2. **Manpower -** Archaeology is a very very small field, it is estimated that there are only 60,000 archaeologists worldwide.  I'd say it's closer to 80,000 but it is a problematic estimation and based on the numbers, roughly 10-15% of those are in academic or research positions so maybe 12,000 academic archaeologists worldwide.  The only consistency in defining what an archaeologist is around the world is that they have a bachelors degree. In most countries, roughly 99% of those who work professionally (based on those surveys from above) have at least a bachelors degree.  That is problematic for reasons I won't be able to get into but briefly because there are a lot of volunteers, students, and laborers who don't have degrees but should be qualified as archaeologists for the work that they do.  The higher estimation is based on percentage of eligible individuals in the workforce and the average number of archaeologists as a percentage of population per country based on the above survey.  \nThis is a long winded way of saying that there aren't enough archaeologists to do the work.  Egypt's old [Supreme Council of Antiquities](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yjy673dm) suggested in 2011 that it had 40,000 permanent employees and 15,000 temporary employees, who knows what that number is now. I'm not familiar with Egyptian archaeology but it's likely that most of those people are administrators or not involved with archaeology itself. Either way, it is a limited number of people meant to be dealing with an entire nation's worth of heritage and a nation that has so much of it to begin with.  \nThis has a big impact on research and development as archaeologists are usually desperately low on time and funding which leads us to do everything ourselves or wait for others to do it.  Some of that is ego but a lot of it is because we haven't professionalized our field so we waste time and money constantly redoing the same things, building databases, recording systems, redefining some part of archaeology, working on outreach, grants, running our websites, teaching, etc.  Our time to devote to research and development is limited.  When it comes to research and development, we still do it but usually on an individual level and usually as part of PhD research where it doesn't get widely disseminated or used unless it's part of a huge project that gets a lot of attention (hence the sensationalizing of a lot of projects).  That 12,000 number is likely much much lower in terms of people actually working on these types of innovations.  Judging from departments and conference topics it's probably closer to 4,000 - 5,000 archaeologists working on these types of technological innovations *worldwide* but that's purely speculation.\n3. **Funding -** Archaeology no matter how important or how impressive the site, is chronically underfunded.  Our groups, universities, companies, non-profits, everything is in such a wildly complicated and complex fragmented state where we unnecessarily compete against each other for funding.  There are so many companies and organizations doing the same damn thing and separating out what little time and funding we have.  The group that is undertaking this project is a perfect example of this issue, which I'll get to in a second. First, and this feeds into the previous issue of manpower, there are constant efforts to [monitor heritage sites](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yck49cdn) but there is just so much of it. I don't know what Egyptian laws are but most European countries along with North American countries have established basic laws and conventions like the [Valetta Convention](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2dxh8da4).  These establish that archaeology and heritage needs to be assessed, preserved, and recorded to some level before it is likely damaged by development and construction.  This is such a complicated, underfunded, and underdeveloped part of heritage management and archaeology that has archaeologists spread too thinly world-wide.  It's made so much worse in places like Egypt, Greece, or Italy where they have so many sites and archaeological material everywhere and constant development efforts.  I don't know how up to date the number is, but in pyramids alone Egypt has *at least* [118](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egyptian_pyramids#cite_note-1).  They need to fund research, analysis, and preservation of all of that and a huge range of other projects beyond those typical periods.That means that even though the Great Pyramids are so widely admired and there's such a desire to understand them, they are likely underfunded.  The [ScanPyramids](http:\/\/www.scanpyramids.org\/index-en.html) project which is part of the [Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute](http:\/\/www.hip.institute\/) looks to be primarily externally funded with **25 different partners and sponsors.** I  know very little about this organization and the project, they were only established in 2015 and the have little to no information available which means they're another one of hundreds of similar organizations and groups trying to do this type of '3D' or 'non-invasive' research.  Their [one publication](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/448krmnd) does not acknowledge any funders and their website is frustratingly vague.  I don't really want to get into the specifics of it and won't argue that the science and technology are cool and innovative but the overall project is a little sketch and missing a lot of information. Primarily the lack of any information on the teams aside from the 3 founding members, none of whom are involved with archaeology or heritage in any meaningful way is sketchy and, unfortunately, a problematic and common occurrence in archaeology and heritage.\n\nEdit: sorry for the edits, the formatting went all wonky at one point.","upvotes":64,"created_utc":1678102380.0},{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

To make it safe for people would require a lot more work for cleanup than is currently viewed as justifiable to expend. If people lived there, they'd be getting sick from the arsenic and accidentally blowing themselves up. \n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki were attacked by relatively high-altitude atomic bomb explosions. They received a very high initial radiation dose, which created some artificial radioactivity, and some other forms of delayed radiation. But because they were high-altitude detonations the amount of local fallout was fairly small. The amount of radioactive contamination was relatively small; most of that radioactivity was very short-term. The main damage to the cities was from blast and fire which, while devastating, are not long-term hazards to an area.\n\nToday the Trinity site, where the same type of bomb as Nagasaki was set off on a relatively short tower, is still mildly radioactive: if you spent an hour there, you'd pick up about 10 \u03bcSv. So if you spent a year there, you'd pick up an additional 88 mSv (note the unit change; 1 mSv = 1000 \u03bcSv). By comparison, you pick up ~5 mSv per year from natural sources. So it's maybe 10\u201320X more radioactive than background levels. The lowest one-year dose clearly linked to an increase in cancer risk is 100 mSv. So 88 mSv is high-enough that, in a sufficiently large population, especially one with pregnant women and children (who are more vulnerable to low-levels of radiation), you'd expect to start seeing \"excess\" cancers (cancers above the \"baseline\") from the radiation alone. Hence, you can't live there \u2014 it is \"uninhabitable.\" But it is still a place people can visit and work (I only point this out because people often don't realize that \"uninhabitable\" doesn't by itself mean \"totally off limits\"). Anyway, that gives us some sense of what Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have been like, at least around ground zero, had the weapons been detonated lower to the ground, without extensive cleanup efforts. But they weren't. \n\nAnyway, as I said, apples and oranges. Radioactivity has nothing to do with chemical contamination, much less unexploded ordnance. And I do always feel the need to point out that even though radioactive contamination can last a long time, there are plenty of chemical toxins that last forever. Indeed, the longer that an element is radioactive for (the longer its half-life), the less intensely radioactive it actually is; the stuff that is most dangerous is the stuff with the short half-lives.\n\nThis is, incidentally, not really a \"historical\" question as posed; it is essentially a technical question. A historical question might be: Why did the French decide to just cordon off the _zone rouge_, as opposed to make a major effort to clean it up? (They do clean it up, but it will take centuries to be clean at their current rate. I don't know the answer to this question.) Or, why were the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki set off so high? Was it to avoid radioactive contamination? (No: the heights of burst were chosen to maximize the radius of the blast pressure regime thought to be the most damaging to civilian buildings, including housing. That this meant decreasing contamination was a secondary consideration.) Or, how has radioactivity affected the discourse about Hiroshima and Nagasaki? (A long and complicated answer, but one rooted in ideas about the \"specialness\" of the attacks, and mixed with a good deal of confusion and misinformation from the start.)","upvotes":820,"created_utc":1678061028.0}]},{"title":"did people in the past know what year they living in? eg. someone living in the 1500s. would they know they were in the year 1500 like we know we're in the year 2023?","author":"puffadiddypuffpun","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11jq2au\/did_people_in_the_past_know_what_year_they_living\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678082038.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Secondly,\nAH (anno hegirae) years after Mohammad leaving Mecca for Medina, chiefly in the parts of Europe under ottoman control (and in fact, the rest of the islamic world). In the latter, the AD 1500s would be the late 800s and 900s.\nJews in both those areas counted years after the proposed creation of earth, making it the 4200s and 4100s. As they represented a minority, it would however be likely that there was knowledge of the other systems, at the very least with traders.\n\nOutside of Europe, there would be for example the the Era System in parts of Asia, namely (todays) China, Japan, Korea  and Vietnam, relying either on the year of the ruler's ascencion to the throne and\/or a motto declared by them. This could make time periods rather short.\nOn the Indian subcontinent, there were at that time so many systems in place that is rather hard to keep track of, but most certainly, very few people would have been aware of AD counting of years.","upvotes":51,"created_utc":1678096088.0}]},{"title":"How have Hindus receives Schopenhauer\u2019s \u201cWorld as Will and Representation\u201d?","author":"Remote_Doughnut_5261","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11kfign\/how_have_hindus_receives_schopenhauers_world_as\/","text":"Schopey talks up how \u201cthe reader has also already received and assimilated the divine inspiration of ancient Indian wisdom, then he is best of all prepared to hear what I have to say to him.\u201d\n\nHe especially emphasizes how reality \u201chas no essence independent of mental perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible terms.\" \n\n\u201cThese words adequately express the compatibility of empirical reality with transcendental ideality.\u201d\n\nHow have Hindus responded to this analysis?

There had been many transformations before that period (including the expansion of the royal judicial system at the expense of lordly\/manorial courts, shift from personal military service to taxation, etc) but in the late fifteenth century \u201cwars of the roses era\u201d lords were still extremely powerful figures controlling large private armies of retainers and fortified castles. Over the course of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, however, kings claimed greater powers and proved more successful at putting down rebellions (Queen Elizabeth\u2019s defeat of the revolt of the northern earls is one key watershed). Retaining and private fortifications were both legally restricted. The militia system was increasingly disassociated from private principalities and set on a county basis. One underrated factor in the decline of the military nobility was the rise of the towns\u2014the middle classes played a decisive role in the wars of the roses and afterwards their tendency to stick by the monarchy doomed many aristocratic and lower class revolts\u2014at least until the massive defection of so many townsmen in the 1640s.\n\nAt the same period, however, there was also a major cultural shift internal to the aristocracy. Keeping up drafty castles began to be seen as an unfashionable burden\u2014the cool thing was to knock them down to build an airy mansion with big windows better for normal civilian life. Maintaining large numbers of armed retainers to eat you out of house and home began to seem ridiculous\u2014couldn\u2019t that money be better spent and even patronage be more efficient\u2014directed towards influencing members of parliament and civil servants rather than winning on some hypothetical civil war battlefield? New humanistic ideologies made personal independence seem more valuable and wearing the badge and livery of some other man seem degrading instead of empowering. The result of all these trends is a shift from a late medieval warrior nobleman\u2014splendid to be sure but resident in a fortified castle, surrounded by a retinue armed to the teeth and reliant on his military power for importance\u2014to an early modern country gentleman\u2014focused on  conspicuous consumption and perhaps agricultural improvement, and with a power base in his ability to influence the national political system. In short, from an aristocratic perspective, why fight the underlying political, class and military shifts when one could simply shift culturally along with them and still retain a position of dominance?\n\nStill even in the early seventeenth century some noblemen fought this transition. Queen Elizabeth gifted her favorite the Earl of Leicester an absolutely massive fortified castle and let him stuff it with weaponry. Some nobles in 1600 or even 1640 were still keeping men at arms and maintaining their castles\u2014castles that ironically turned out to be fairly useful when civil war *did* come. In the early sixteenth century their were still a few pretty independent principalities like the Bishopric of Durham or the goofy Kingdom of Man. By the late century, however, England had shifted decisively towards a national military system, Cromwell had razed almost every military-capable castle to the ground, and local aristocratic militarism would be thence restricted to an informal monopoly upon leadership roles in a local militia of dubious military relevance and firm national oversight. Still, gentility would never completely lose its martial qualities even into the twentieth century\u2014gentlemen were still expected to serve in the military and to do things like fight duels through the nineteenth.\n\nPostlude: The lords also retained the House of Lords and certain privileges and the gentry as a whole dominance in the House of Commons thanks to property qualifications and the corrupt districting system but all this would gradually be chipped away to nothing over the long duree. The next part of the story (1700-1950, say) is about how the landed country gentlemen lost their grip on the national political system in the face of democratic political movements and an economic shift from agrarianism to industrial capitalism. Everyone from urban workers, industrialists, merchants, women of various classes, educated professionals, etc etc would increasingly demand entry into a political system dominated by landed gentry and titled aristocrats and as the economic and demographic power shifted to those groups they were bound to succeed sooner or later, although today the aristocracy retains enough prestige, real estate, wealth and connections to maintain a surprising amount of informal power, although the days of principalities, castles and retinues are long over.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678219782.0}]},{"title":"What did the other European nations & monarchs think and say about the UK during the civil war, execution of Charles I and the period of the republic?","author":"lets_chill_dude","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11khwty\/what_did_the_other_european_nations_monarchs\/","text":"I did the stuarts at school, and have been relistening to the Revolutions podcast about the period, so I know it quite well, but I can\u2019t remember this ever being brought up. \n\nDid the foreign monarchs worry it could be a trend that could spread to their countries?","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678145328.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

But this is the problem with a lot of ancient philosophers, that we mainly know them from far later authors. Especially with Hellenistic-period Greek works we know there were a lot, but they mainly survive via citations and mentions by Roman-era authors.\n\nA good place to start might be the famous story of Diogenes' meeting with Alexander (himself a person whose life comes mainly from sources written hundreds of years later). As u\/EnclavedMicrostate describes in [this thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/jxx15q\/based_on_what_is_known_about_alexander_the_greats\/), the anecdote is told by several of the Alexander-biographers, as well as Cicero, the philosopher Dio, and Diogenes La\u00ebrtius; and possibly derives from a work written by one of Diogenes' students. Cicero in fact mentions the Cynic several times in his works, and is the earlierst surviving author I could find who does. Other Roman-period authors mentioning him are Epictetus and Aulus Gellius, for instance.\n\nAlso, reading Diogenes La\u00ebrtius one will quickly find he cites earlier authors very frequently. Now some of these are quite late or of little worth, but a few would be his contemporaries, for instance Theophrastus and Polyeuctus. He also mentions Diogenes' own writing, though noting that their authenticity is disputed.\n\nTo conclude, we have references to Diogenes of Sinope from several ancient sources, not just La\u00ebrtius. I would say they are sufficient for making his historicity by far the likeliest option, especially given the lost sources referred to by his namesake.

I'm unsure where you're from, but if you want PhD programs studying Australian history, every major Australian tertiary institution offers them while the Australian Research Council is generally supportive - by way of grants - of scholars who want to do research into Australian history. This is particularly true of Australia's most prestigious institutions. Here, I am thinking about the University of Melbourne, Australian National University, Monash University, and the University of Sydney. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, undergraduate history degrees in Australia do not always make the study of Australian history compulsory. Meanwhile, at a graduate level, many choose to specialise in other regions. The University of Melbourne for example, of which I am an alumni, has long had a distinguished Russian history program. Alexander Kerensky lectured here, Sheila Fitzpatrick was a product of Unimelb and was a professor there for a long time. Often, students are drawn to this. However, by the same token, this doesn't mean that the study of Australian history isn't prioritised. Geoffrey Blainey and Stuart Macintyre, both internationally recognised historians who fundamentally shaped history writing and historiography in Australia, were long-standing institutional stalwarts. \n\nAt the end of the day though, Australian history is quite niche. We are a small, far-flung region of the world. We are also a young nation in terms of our colonial history. The history of Australia before that is even more arcane and a rather fringe academic subject even here. The History Wars in Australia haven't helped and it doesn't surprise me at all that the rest of the world pays little attention to developing programs or extensive scholarship on us. I'd also point to the fact that while Australia is a continent, it's also a single-country and this rather unique configuration has resulted in a peculiar degree of insularity and isolation. Perhaps you are familiar with Blainey's famous book entitled 'The Tyranny of Distance'. As a consequence we do exist in a bit of a silo which probably contributes to some of what your question alludes too. \n\nWith regards to your final point, I could spend all day talking about this, but I'll try and be brief. Responses which suggest we don't deify our leaders do allude to a real sentiment. We don't tend to place leaders on a pedestal in the way the Founding Fathers, for instance, are. However, this does not at all mean that there aren't famous Australians who are widely recognisable around the nation. The bushranger Ned Kelly is a great example of this. Curtin who you pointed to is another. Most Australians would also be familiar with John Monash who led our armed forces in World War I and is the greatest military mind our country has produced. I think few Australians would have an issue listing a number of highly influential sporting figures or, for that matter, Rupert Murdoch. \n\nSometimes we're not very good at recognising our own though. We have often neglected scientists, particularly in the medical fields who have made pathbreaking advances and won Nobel Prizes. Florey helped commerically develop Penicillin, the first antibiotic; Macfarlane Burnet discovered immunological tolerance; Eccles elucidated how nerve cells work; Warren and Marshall discovered helicobacter; Blackburn discovered telomeres and their function. We also often forget our great modernist literary master, Patrick White, who also won a Nobel Prize. \n\nIf you want to talk further about Australian history, lmk and I hope this goes some way to answering your question.","upvotes":34,"created_utc":1678112369.0},{"author":"Kochevnik81","text":"I've taken some Australian history classes as an undergrad (and my history program actually *did* offer a minor in Australian history, but this was basically an initiative of the Australian embassy, which does tell you how rare that is), so here are a few thoughts.\n\nFirst is that while Australia is a whole continent (and has a *massive* amount of natural history), in human terms it's nowhere near continent sized: it's 25 million people currently (there are quite a few [urban areas](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/912263\/population-of-urban-agglomerations-worldwide\/) with more people than the entire country-continent of Australia), and in earlier parts of its history it had much lower if pretty stable numbers. On top of that, Australian history has usually tended to mean the non-indigenous written history, as opposed to Aboriginal history with its oral traditions getting lumped into anthropology. This makes Australian history pretty short: conventionally it \"starts\" in 1788. Also more than 29% of Australians are foreign born, and the country has always had a big immigrant population which means that ties to Australian history are complicated at best. \n\nBut on top of those constraints, a major issue around Australian history is that, to be blunt, it has a lot of the political problems of US history cranked up to 11. By this I mean that Australian history is really doesn't get far from history of the British Empire and many of its more problematic moments, but also public remembrance of Australian history gets quickly tied into one's opinion of the Empire (or related topics like Republicanism vs. Monarchy). \n\nFor a very quick rundown: history of settlement vs the Australian Aborigines will stand out as a major, *major* point of contention. White settlers had by and large an extremely low opinion of Aborigines: the official legal policy was that the continent was *terra nullius* (ie, the land didnt belong to anyone) until 1788. This wasn't reversed until 1992. The \"frontier wars\" against indigenous communities continued until 1934 (and until almost that time included events like the 1928 Coniston Massacre that saw hundreds of men, women and children murdered by ranchers with impunity). Boarding schools similar to Canadian and US residential schools were operated (with pretty open genocidal intent) for aboriginal children in a \"child removal\" policy until the 1970s, and this resulted in the Stolen Generations. Aborigines even as adults were often denied full citizenship unless by law they adopted the \"habits and manner of civilized people\" - until the 1960s, and weren't counted in official censuses until 1967. And this was all against an official version of Australian history that saw the white settling of the continent as peaceful, with \"primitive\" Aborigines literally slinking back into the Bush and facing eventually extinction. \n\nBut even outside of indigenous relations, Australian history had and has loads of problems and contradictions. Well into the 20th century the official view was that it was a model British colony: \"more British than Britain\". It didn't really have a definitive, sharp break with Britain that, say, the US did: federation with Dominion status and a constitution (which was intentionally a mix of the British and US constitutions) happened in 1901, the Statute of Westminster gave it more independence in 1931, but the last constitutional links with Britain were ended by mutual Parliamentary Australia Acts in 1986. Australian Nationality (as distinct from an explicit British Nationality complete with British passports) didn't legally exist until 1949. Some of the first laws passed after the 1901 federation were immigration laws, known as the \"White Australia\" laws, that restricted immigration to people of white, European origin (and even then often only the \"right sort\"). These laws weren't fully scrapped until 1975.\n\nEven for the white Australian population, a lot of national images selectively draw from history, and often in ways at odds with reality. For all the talk of the Outback, squatters, drovers and diggers, post-1788 Australia has always been an overwhelmingly urban society: almost 90% of the population lives in urban areas, and like 75% of the total population lives in the biggest six urban areas alone. Other aspects of that settler history get ignored too: the 1854 Eureka Stockade rebellion was put down quickly, and still has some national memory but that's associated a bit *too* much with socialism and republicanism, and therefore doesn't have a long history of widespread public recognition.","upvotes":20,"created_utc":1678113003.0}]},{"title":"What is the history of the true form\/final form trope?","author":"StoatStonksNow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11k0ktw\/what_is_the_history_of_the_true_formfinal_form\/","text":"Anyone whose consumed media in the fantasy or science fiction genres probably immediately knew what I was talking about here: just when the big bad looks defeated, he drinks the experimental super serum\/merges with an ancient and terrible deity\/absorbs the cosmic energy\/does the thingy\/sheds his mortal disguise and transforms into a more powerful but inhuman shape.\n\nThe first things like this are appear to be as old as storytelling: someone is nice to a stranger; the stranger turns out to be an angel or deity.

My main source is Colleen Taylor Sen, *Curry: A Global History*; another good book for more general background is Rachel Laudan, *Cuisine and Empire*. Note I am using \"Indian\" and \"South Asian\" somewhat interchangeably to include Pakistanis and Bangladeshis; many self-described Indian restaurants in the United States are actually operated by Pakistanis and serve Punjabi-derived menu items (kabobs, biryanis) that would also be found in Pakistan. I'm also talking about the United States here.\n\nCurry and Indian food more generally became part of cuisine in the Anglosphere for two interrelated reason: imperial connections to India (e.g., English-speakers going to India and then bringing the food with them to the British Isles or other regions) and immigration from India. Sen defines *curry* as primarily \"a spiced meat, fish, or vegetable stew served with rice, bread, cornmeal, or another starch\" and secondarily as \"any dish, wet or dry, flavoured with curry powder -- a ready-made mixture that generally includes turmeric, cumin seed, coriander seed, chillies, and fenugreek (and may or may not contain curry leaf . . .).\" We see both in the United States though not to the same degree as in, for example, the United Kingdom. \n\nI should also acknowledge the terminology of *curry* and the use of premade curry powder were significantly questioned in the 1970s-80s, with some arguing the terms and ingredients were reductionist, to some degree imperialist, and did not reflect the true breadth of Indian cuisine. This may be why, as Sen notes, the term *curry* is often not found on menus in the United States. So it may be unclear to the American customer who has ordered lamb rogan josh or chicken vindaloo whether these are *curries* or not. (By contrast, Thai restaurants almost invariably have a menus section headed *curries*.)\n\nBecause of the imperial connections, there was something of an Anglosphere-wide curry craze from about the mid 18th to the mid 19th century. This included British North America. Sen notes various curries were available in Boston taverns in the early 19th century. Early and mid 19th century American cookbooks contain curry recipes. Curry powder has always been available at markets.\n\nIn fact, there are a very few dishes left over from this period that are served in non-Indian (i.e., generic or regional) restaurants. Most notable are mulligatawny (a kind of creamy curry soup notably containing apples, invented by South Indian cooks when the British demanded a soup course) and country captain (a classic 19th century Anglo-Indian curry: chicken chunks and onion sauteed in curry powder then served over rice, often with raisins and almonds).\n\nMulligatawny shows up in a number of cookbooks and restaurants that have no ostensible connection to India. It is sometimes correctly described as a colonial-era soup--but that is only half the story, as those colonial-era cookbooks clearly identified it is an Indian soup. Basically the same mulligatawny is also a staple dish in Indian restaurants in the United States and Britain though apparently unknown to most people in India.\n\nCountry captain is nowadays often claimed to belong to Low Country cuisine (the regional cuisine of Charleston, South Carolina and its hinterland) and to have been served or inspired by a sea captain visiting the area. In fact, country captain was served in restaurants and homes all over the East Coast (including Delmonico's in New York) in the late 19th and early 20th century, and in fact the same dish with the same name is also part of the Anglo-Indian repertoire served in London and Mumbai. It is definitely not a Charleston original as is sometimes claimed, and like mulligatawny it was originally identified as Indian in origin. \n\nThere is also the issue of curried chicken salad (a cold dish of cooked chicken and possibly fresh vegetables drowned in mayonnaise flavored with curry powder, sometimes used as a sandwich filling). Sen suggests it was a possibly invented in the American South, but Laudan points out the basic technique of mayonnaise salads started becoming common throughout the Anglosphere in the late 19th century and curry powder, always on hand, added both color and flavor. The English dishes Jubilee Chicken (1935) and Coronation Chicken (1954) are curried chicken salads. So it's unclear where this dish originated, but certainly by the mid-20th century it would have been familiar around the globe.\n\nThe above dishes were almost entirely prepared in the United States by people (both African-American and white) who had no personal connection to India, though we should note there had been some Indian cooks in colonial households. And they were continued by non-Indians, which helps explain why knowledge of their connection to India was lost. Of course, these dishes are perhaps not the core elements of American cuisine, but they are reminders of those old connections to Indian cuisine.\n\nWe can contrast this with the situation in Britain and its empire, which saw a lot more movement of people and direct contacts with India. Large numbers of Indians moved within the Empire to (just to pick some places with really interesting food adaptations) Kenya, Jamaica, and Fiji. In addition, many people from the British Isles either went to India themselves or had contact with someone who did. By contrast, there was very little Indian immigration to the United States before the mid 20th century (and particularly immigration reform in 1965), very few Americans had the opportunity to eat Indian food prepared by Indians, and very few Americans traveled to India (even during WWII). There were a few notable Indian-chefed restaurants in New York in the 1900s-30s known for their spicy curries, but in general Indian was not perceived as a prestigious ethnic cuisine\n\nWhile Indian food was becoming more widely available in the post-1965 era, I'd certainly agree it's not in the top tier of \"ethnic\" cuisines in the United States in terms of visibility, influence, or consumption. In an chapter on \"Indian Food in the USA,\" Jayanta Sengupta points out that while some post-1965 Indian immigrants certainly opened restaurants, the community as a whole were mostly educated professionals who did not form ethnic enclaves and did not rely on restaurants for income. Indian restaurants mostly served Indian clienteles looking for a connection to their heritage. This contrasts with the situation in Britain where South Asian immigrants were more working-class (like many other immigrant communities coming to America), tended to be ghettoized, and opened numerous restaurants that attracted business from outside the community. So the Indian restaurant business grew slowly both compared to Indian restaurants in Britain and non-Indian cuisines in the America. Sen theorizes that Americans who wished to try a spicy cuisine already had Mexican, Chinese, and Thai options competing with Indian.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678298544.0}]},{"title":"What was like like for the average Roman during the last days of the Western Roman Empire?","author":"ibelieveindoh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11kgb7q\/what_was_like_like_for_the_average_roman_during\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678141759.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

In the 1830-1859 period, which I think most relevant to this question, it could be used in three senses. \n\n \n\nIn the first sense, it referred to the Whig leadership in both Houses of Parliament (and, at this point, the designated leader of the Whigs could sometimes be found in the House of Lords, as Earl Grey was) and most, but not all, MPs and peers who followed the direction of the leader\u2019s Whips in Parliament. \n\n \n\nIn the second sense, it referred to a group of aristocratic and landed families, who often held high office within Whig governments, and directed the fortunes and policy of the party. Aristocratic families and wealthy individuals had formed the factions that had made up the Whig party since the Revolution. But not all of these families currently supported the Whigs at this point.\n\n \n\nIn the third sense, \u2018whigs\u2019 could simply refer to ideological support for the Glorious Revolution and its results, notably the limited monarchy, the Hanoverian dynasty and Protestantism. With the exception of those Irish MPs who were organised in the Repeal Association at this time, the entirety of British politics at this point could be described as \u2018whig\u2019. In the third sense, the term is used in the lower case.\n\n \n\nTo understand the Whigs in the first sense, it is also necessary to understand the Radicals in the 1830-59 period. The Radicals were those MPs on the political left who took that label, rather than use the Whig label. The Radical movement had originated in the urban middle-class and working-class protest movements which had emerged in the last few decades of the eighteenth century, and had been greatly stimulated by both the American and French Revolutions. They represented those parts of society which were underrepresented and marginalised by traditional British elite politics.\n\n \n\nThe Radicals, as a whole, had grave suspicions of the Whigs in Parliament, largely because they were Whigs in the second sense. The Whigs were sometimes seen as seeking nothing more than to occupy ministerial places, and exercising the powers of government and patronage in traditional Tory fashion; they were aristocratically frivolous; and they were timid in putting through the fundamental structural reforms the Radicals agitated for. From the Whig point of view, Radicals could be wild, and an unstable and erratic force that made them less effective electoral and parliamentary tools, and a potential avenue to revolution.\n\n \n\nBut, with these reservations in mind, the Radicals were, on the whole, happy to accept the political leadership of the Whigs. They made no attempt to establish a party or a Whip of their own in Parliament, or build an independent mass membership organisation outside Parliament, although they did create influential pressure groups. Allied to them were the Irish MPs of the Repeal Association, who were broadly Radical, but often pursued independent lines directed to Irish objectives and interests.\n\n \n\nAnother thing to note is that political parties, in Britain, were still far from the modern political party of the present day, and hadn\u2019t developed some of the features that the American Whigs - and, even more, the Democrats - had adopted by that point. They didn\u2019t have mass membership, although local clubs and associations were formed on an ad hoc basis to support Whig principles in general or particular candidates. \n\n \n\nIn the 1830-1859 period, Whigs in the first sense were the dominant party at Westminster, but were influenced by various factors. Firstly, the reforms Whigs themselves had supported weakened landowning influence and expanded the urban electorate, affecting the Whig\/Radical balance. Secondly, a proportion of traditional Whigs became increasingly conservative, and resistant to further reform, despite Radical pressures. Thirdly, the split in the Conservative party led to the formation of the Peelites, who, for much of the 1850s, they held the effective balance of power. Gladstone became their most notable representative over the course of the 1850s. Fourthly, for most of the 1850s, a factional divide arose between supporters of Lord Palmerston and those of Lord John Russell.\n\n \n\nIn 1859, events in Italy went a fair way to allowing the Whigs to strengthen their standing. Italian unification was a cause which had widespread popular support in Britain, particularly on the left; through a mixture of liberalism and anti-Catholicism. The Conservative minority government, under internal pressure, equivocated. At a meeting in London in 1859, Whig, Radical and Peelite MPs pledged to act together to turn out the government, and referred to themselves as Liberals. Henceforth, the term superseded the others in electoral politics.\n\n \n\nThe new Liberal party was initially, simply a rebranded version of the Whigs. Palmerston (and, even more after him, John Russell) were, in character and policy, recognisably Whig. But, in the longer term, the Liberals evolved, and the Whigs in the second sense became a tendency within the party which eventually left it. \n\n \n\nNow, the US Whigs, whom I know much less about, are a quite different proposition. They arose from the ashes of Federalism in the 1820s, as an anti-Jacksonian party, inspired by the genius of Henry Clay, and most eager to project specific parts of the Hamiltonian vision through high tariffs and sound money. Their story in the 1850s was once of fundamental dissension over slavery and then collapse, rather than absorption, with the Kansas-Nebraska Act being the breaking point. They were not really aligned with British Whiggism, as they were dealing with a very different kind of electorate and nation. \n\n \n\nSome starting points for reading:\n\n \n\nPolitical Parties in Britain 1783-1867, Eric J.

India has always been incredibly diverse and the pre-European Indian sub-continent was massively divided along religious lines as 4 major religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism) were founded there along side very strong Muslim influences and populations, seen in the Mughal Empires domination of India at the time. The Indian sub-continent was also divided between Kingdoms and regions and on ethnicity. Today there are 22 languages recognised by the Indian Government as National languages. India also has the caste system which further divided the people in the continent.\n\nIt then becomes evident that the Indian subcontinent is a very divided place as there are so many separating factors between groups. \n\nThe British were able to exploit these differences. They realised that they would be a lot more successful fighting against individual Kingdoms than a United Indian Subcontinent as the sheer population would overwhelm them. This causes the strategy of \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d. \n\nThe British initially arrived in India in the form of the \u201cBritish East-India Company\u201d, which was a private company but that\u2019s for a completely different question. The British East India Company wanted to break down Spain and Portugal\u2019s monopoly on the Asian Spice Trade, and therefore set up trading posts (like the Spanish and Portuguese did) along the Indian coast to make deals with the local people and Kings. The British East Indian Company would join forces with the Dutch version (VOC) to kick the Portuguese and Spanish out, then after years of fighting the Dutch Britain would get a monopoly over trade in India. In 1858 India would become a colony of the British Crown and no longer under the control of the British East-India Company. \n\nThe British were able to exploit differences between populations in the Indian Subcontinent to further cement their power and administrative authority over the area. This was done through negotiations with Kings so that they would turn on other Kings and essentially do the administrative work in their Kingdoms for the British. It would be reasonably easy to entice Kings to be on friendly terms with the British, just offer them trading opportunities and protection from other kingdoms. Once the Kings were in line their subjects would also be in line as well. This meant the British could save money. The British aimed to keep tensions between the Kingdoms in India high so that they would never unite to fight back against the British. \n\nThe British also had a much stronger military. The British Navy was vastly superior to any Indian navy, meaning the Indians could never really kick the British out as they could always sail away, regroup and then come back. The British military had much better equipment, this gave them a technological superiority over the Indians. The British also had better organisation and battle tactics, meaning that the Indian army would often be outsmarted. The British army was professional, meaning the soldiers got a guaranteed wage. The British army was also open to Indians, meaning that Many Indians joined the British Army as a job and because they saw no problem in fighting against Kingdoms that they had always been fighting against. This was opposed to the Indian armies which were often filled with mercenaries who were not paid regularly and there was a lot of bureaucracy over their payment (this causes many campaigns to be stalled as the Mercanaries were frustrated with how the payment system worked). This meant that many Indian soldiers joined the British Army. \n\nHope this helps :)","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678201468.0}]},{"title":"What reliable websites can I use to research the crimean war?","author":"BlueHalfq","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11kgok3\/what_reliable_websites_can_i_use_to_research_the\/","text":"I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this in, but I'm looking for reliable websites that I can use to research the crimean war for an essay.

Athens apparently had nothing like this.\n\nBut I've been reading Xenophon's Memorabilia. In one of the dialogues, Socrates is talking to a recently-appointed Athenian cavalry commander \u2014 two of whom were appointed each year \u2014 apparently serving during peacetime.\n\nThis line makes me think it is peacetime, when Socrates is wondering why the commander wanted the job:\n\n>\u2018Well then, is it because you think that you might hand back cavalry which you have improved to the State, and that if any need for mounted troops should arise you might do our country some service as their commander?\u2019\n\nSince there were no standing troop formations, exactly what was this commander overseeing? Socrates makes is sound like it's the commander's job to be improving the state of the cavalry. But you say there is no cavalry?\n\nAt first the commander says it's not his job to oversee the state of his troop's horses.\n\nBut then Socrates points out that:\n\n>\u2018suppose that you find some of them turning out their horses with such bad feet or legs, or in such poor condition, or so underfed, that they can\u2019t keep up with the rest, and you find others coming up with horses which are so fresh that they won\u2019t keep their places or are such kickers that you can\u2019t get them into position at all \u2013 what will be the good of your cavalry? How will you be able to do your country any service if your troopers are mounted like that?\u2019\n\nAnd then, regarding the riders:\n\n>\u2018Well, now, what about the horsemen? Won\u2019t you try to improve their quality?\u2019 \u2018  \n>  \n>Yes, I will.\u2019  \n>  \n>\u2018Won\u2019t you begin by making them better at mounting their horses?\u2019  \n>  \n>\u2018I ought to, certainly, because then if one of them fell off, his chances of survival would be improved.\u2019  \n>  \n>\u2018And next, if you have to risk an engagement, will you order them to draw the enemy on to the sandy ground where you are accustomed to exercise, or will you try to carry out your training in the sort of country in which campaigns are fought?\u2019\n\nI realize that Xenophon was a successful general and may be putting words in Socrates's mouth. Maybe it was he, and not Socrates, who thought Athen's cavalry needed more oversight.\n\nBut we're starting from the position of a commander who's been appointed to oversee cavalry. If he had no ability to train over oversee his potential draftees, what is this whole dialogue about?\n\nShould the conversation be about trying to get the assembly to agree to periodic training for the cavalry rather than advising the newly-elected commander \u2014who will have no legal ability to do anything until war is declared \u2014 on what he needs to be considering?\n\n**I feel like either:**  \n**1)** There must have been some peacetime training.  \n**2)** Socrates is weirdly arguing for a cavalry commander to attempt to train potential troopers who he has no current legal command over, and apparently getting the commander to agree to do it, without so much as him mentioning that he has no legal authority to do the training he's agreeing to do. \n\nDoes this not strike you as weird?","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1678114653.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

It is technically possible that Theophobos himself was a Persian who got involved with a non-Persian rebellion again the Abbasids, but there is no evidence to suggest this and no reason to assume it is likely aside from the Byzantines describing them as Persian at a time when that label was synonymous with Iranian in the west.\n\nNor does the Theophobos seem to have been a Kurd. He lived in the very earliest period of identifiable Kurdish identity in the 11th Century. It had not even reached the Byzantine vernacular yet, and thus their sources aren't useful for identifying anybody as a kurd or not. This is partly because \"kurd\" originates from Middle Persian *kwrt*, which was not an ethnic label. Instead, Sassanid-era Persian texts used \"kurd\" to describe any (semi-)nomadic Iranian group. It was purely a social category. By the 9th-10th Century, Arab sources started using \"Kurd\" (*al-Akrad*) more specifically to reference Iranian nomads and herdsmen living around Lake Van and Lake Urmia. With the addition of a specific geographic criteria, Kurd started refering to a specific set of people with shared language and culture, which forms the basis for ethnic identity.\n\nHowever, Theophobos was not a nomad from the Van-Urmia region, and the Arabic sources do not identify him or those around him as Kurds. Instead, he was from the Korrami community to the north in modern Eastern and Western Azeberbaijan provinces, which all just part of the Caliphate's province of Adurbidjan. The issue with coming up with an ethnic identity for the Korramis is that \"Korrami\" *technically* refers to the followers of the *din al-Korramiya*, a deviant Islamic creed associated with the Hashemites.\n\nHowever, Babak's followers are the most famous group in the history of a many similar and interconnected groups and spiritual movements in the mountains of northern Iran. Thus, scholars often refer to them all as \"Korramis.\" It probably wasn't what the followers of Babak had used if you asked them to describe something like their ethnicity. To them \"Korrami\" would have been a religious identity that they shared with other far flung groups.\n\nWe have very little information about the Korramis beyond their political goals (expel the Abassids from their lands) and their religion: a synthesis of pre-existing rural Zoroastrian traditions that adopted Shia Islamic terminology as part of a nominal conversion. Many of the socio-cultural practices attributed to Babak and his followers are also associated with other broadly \"Korrami\" communities as far off as Khorasan.\n\nWe do know that they spoke Adari. Also called Old Azeri, Adari was the Iranian language spoken in the northwest before the arrival Turkic peoples. A century before Theophobos' time, Ebn \u1e24awqal described Adari saying \u201cthe language of the people of Azerbaijan and most of the people of Armenia is Iranian, which binds them together, while Arabic is also used among them.\" As Adari speakers in Adurbidjan, it's possible that the Korramis would have described themselves as Adari to outsiders. Ebn Hawqal's suggestion that language bound the people there together certainly supports that, but it is ultimately just well informed speculation.\n\n[Kurds and Kurdistan](https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/Kurds_and_Kurdistan\/TpUFogEACAAJ?hl=en) by Arshak Safrastian\n\n[The Ethnic Identity of the Kurds](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/707655\/The_ethnic_identity_of_the_Kurds) by Martin van Bruinessen\n\nEncyclopaedia Iranica:\n\n[The Iranian Language of Azerbaijan](https:\/\/iranicaonline.org\/articles\/azerbaijan-vii) by E.

Another blacksmith sets up shop, and they compete. But there is not enough business for two: inevitably, one is soon trying to beat the other on price, and they both begin to starve. Or, the price drops and they try to to accommodate that by cutting quality- working too quickly, using cheaper materials, etc. Because of this, the whole town suffers.\n\nThe problem could easily grow if there was a large town and a greater number of specialists; and was a tendency for medieval trades to concentrate. Frankfurt had a big book business, Nuremberg had metalworking. So, the guilds there served a useful purpose in controlling market and competition, regulating disputes between members, terms of apprenticeships, etc. They would also have important social or charitable functions ( some  guilds' charitable and social purposes continued even when their trades became obsolete, like the Bowmakers - \" Bowyers\"- in England). In the later stages before the industrial Revolution, guilds could even become somewhat like bankers- the 18th c. Geneva watchmakers' guild would front materials and supplies to its members, or make loans.","upvotes":142,"created_utc":1678033008.0}]},{"title":"How familiar would Shakespeare's audience have been with the events of the Wars of the Roses?","author":"Brickie78","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ixrwe\/how_familiar_would_shakespeares_audience_have\/","text":"I'm rehearsing for a production of Richard III at the moment and it strikes me how much of the background in terms of relationships between characters etc seems to be taken for granted.\n\n\"Here comes the Earl of Derby\" says a character and in walks a man who will be known for the rest of the play as \"Lord Stanley\".

It is much, much harder to say what \"the average Elizabethan groundling\" might have known about English monarchs than to make the same assessment of Shakespeare himself or the aristocratic audiences that might have been present for performances of a given play. In the case of *Richard III*, the historical account derives from Thomas More's *The History of King Richard III*. But Shakespeare seems to have made significant use (as usual) of Raphael Holinshed's *Chronicles*. The content from Holinshed, in particular, would be familiar to most attentive schoolboys, and so most aristocrats.\\* One way to rephrase your question would be: \"how educated was the average Elizabethan groundling?\"\n\nThe answer here seems to be: not very! For an extremely helpful overview of what theater attendance was like in general, you might look at Holger Syme's contribution to the Norton Shakespeare 3E. He details how the stage invited viewers into performance in non-textual ways (staging, costume, actor, etc). Richard Preiss has rather provocatively argued that plays, as we understand them, occupied a relatively small portion of theater-going. He argues that \"groundlings\" would have been more interested in spectacle (e.g. bear-baiting) and improvisation (e.g. trading insults with the clown) than any play, strictly speaking. In a real sense, the \"drama\" of theater-going had only so much to do with drama as a literary phenomenon. Ellen MacKay has shown how props record as much about historical performances as their scripts, often with grotesque implications. She also details how theater-going entailed a kind of risk. \"Drama\" here refers to what is remarkable or spectacular about the performance, rather than its intricacies. Recall, too, that Shakespeare's plays were performed from memory, and that no use-texts survive for us to consult: the play existed as performance, not as written record. So, again, it's hard to say exactly what a \"groundling\" may have been like, but it seems likely that such a person would have been more interested in R3's hunchback than his heritage. This doesn't necessarily inhibit the moral force of the play, nor does it necessarily make the play a kind of education.\n\nIn this sense, I think your comparison to WWI is apt. The average groundling American watching a movie set around WWI might think, \"ok, sure, the fellow with the glasses is Woodrow Wilson . . . probably the important Russian man is the Kaiser\" etc. But films produced for popular audiences don't assume historical expertise, even when the producers have done their homework. Plenty of folks around this sub would find points to criticize, but they would make the exception, not the rule.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*I add \"attentive\" because asking about the success rate of early modern pedagogy is as unwieldy as asking about the success rate of contemporary pedagogy. Your comparison is good here: how many students that are taught WWI in school could subsequently recount granular historical detail in an entertainment setting? Are they thinking about their textbooks when watching *Captain America*? Maybe some, but it's hardly the norm.\n\nSources\n\nThomas Cartelli, \"Richard III\" in *The Norton Shakespeare 3E*\n\nEllen MacKay, *Fugitive Histories of the Stage in Early Modern England*\n\nRichard Preiss, *Clowning and authorship in early modern theatre*\n\nTiffany Stern, *Documents of Performance in Early Modern England*\n\nHolger Syme, \"The Theater of Shakespeare's Time\" in *The Norton Shakespeare 3E*","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678373587.0}]},{"title":"What are some game-changing contribution in science from the Golden Age of Islam?","author":"Spare_Menu8688","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11jy4o6\/what_are_some_gamechanging_contribution_in\/","text":"I have heard so many good things about about the Golden Age of Islam, i.e how science was flourishing.

British supply lines were extremely long, and the war came at a time when the Royal Navy was in the middle of downsizing for budgetary reasons. One of the three Invincible-class aircraft carriers that were being built had been deemed surplus to requirements and the paperwork was going through on selling it to Australia. The post-WWII days of the 1950s and 1960s, when the Navy had large numbers of Colossus-class aircraft carriers at their disposal, had long gone. In 1982, the Navy only had two carriers ready for use, the Invincible and the older Hermes, which was nearing the end of its service life. (A third carrier was in reserve, but had suffered a serious fire at the end of its service, and had not been fully repaired; it was some months away from being ready for use.) In addition, Argentina invaded in April - that is, the autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. There was a pressing need to complete the recapture of the Falklands before the southern winter came in June.\n\nThe other major advantage that the Argentines had was in the vulnerability of the newest generation of ships to missile attack. Shipbuilding at that time used lighter materials to save weight, meaning the hulls of many of the newer RN destroyers and frigates were very thin-skinned. Missiles tore through them easily. Additionally, although most ships had Sea Cat air-to-air defence systems and a few of the newer models had the more capable Sea Wolf, RN ships were not fitted with point defence systems such as the Oerlikon, leaving them vulnerable. (This was hurriedly rectified after the war.) A successful Argentine air attack on either of the RN's aircraft carriers would have made it all but impossible to continue with the operation for lack of air cover. Admiral Sandy Woodward, who commanded the RN in the South Atlantic during the campaign, wrote afterwards that he felt it was an extremely close-run thing, and that many of the RN's ships were reaching the end of their endurance after several months in the punishing South Atlantic environment.\n\nThe British land forces were outnumbered, and the loss of the Atlantic Conveyor in late May to an Argentine air attack, including its cargo of Chinook helicopters, meant that there were virtually no heavy-lift helicopters for the British troops to use to move across the islands. (One Chinook happened to be off the ship when the attack occurred, and ended up being used more or less continuously for high-priority transportation missions.) The only area in which the British had undisputed superiority was in the air, where the small number of Harrier jump jets being flown off Invincible and Hermes regularly shot down their Argentine equivalents, the Skyhawks. \n\nHope this helps.","upvotes":378,"created_utc":1678034547.0},{"author":"hotfezz81","text":"Just as a point of order: there may be a popular conception that the Argentines were morons to take on the Brits, but in professional study that's not the case at all. The Argentine's could have won the naval campaign before the Royal Navy (RN) had even gotten to the islands:\n\nThe amount of anti-submarine warfare conducted by the brits was enormous, (despite the fact they were targetting 3 or 4 very old diesel subs, which were way outclassed by the british SSNs and fleet in general. In point of fact, most Argentine subs weren't even able to make it to sea). This is because if an argenitine SSK had managed to sink an aircraft carrier, or a troopship, the casualties this could have caused could have spelt the end of the task force before they'd even gotten near the islands. There's anecdotal evidence that the RN explosively took out a number of wales when jumpy ASW operators decided not to risk mis-identifying something. There's a great book *\"Go find him and bring me back his hat\": The Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine campaign in the Falklands\/Malvinas War* if you're interested (note: it's extremely niche).\n\nThere's also recognition that the shortage of Exocets - in part frantically bought up by British secret services - forced the Argentine airforce to rely on older, sometimes non-functional, free fall bombs. These missed more often than not, and in some cases didn't explode (HMS *Plymouth* was struck by four bombs which didn't explode, HMS *Broadsword's* hanger was wrecked by a bomb that bounced through it, richotchected off it's heli and exploded in the sea) these reduced the british naval casualties. This, plus their decision to target escort ships rather than troopships or cargo ships, saved the RN more significant casualties. One or two more lost ships - or certainly one or two more important ships being hit - and the campaign could have been lost before the troops were ashore. \n\nThe RN also ran unavoidable risks with the Argentine fleet. The Belgrano was sunk just outside the exclusion zone to prevent a surface action, but the RN also planned to sink the Argentinian carrier ARA *Veinticinco de Mayo*. The SSN tracking her lost contact, and she got back to harbour before being found and sunk, but it's an example of the sometimes tenuous ability to track enemy warships. If the carrier had gotten a strike on the task force whilst in transit, or the *Belgrano* had gotten close enough for an attack, the task force could have been in trouble.\n\nAll these factors go to show that the success of the British was due to skill, and also to luck. In fact if you read up on the subject, more than one book will end with a quote from Wellington: \"The nearest run thing you ever saw in your life\".","upvotes":81,"created_utc":1678053298.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":-11,"created_utc":1678054865.0}]},{"title":"Did the KGB require its members to be ideologically aligned with Marxist-Leninism?","author":"ChromaHeretic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11k0pvk\/did_the_kgb_require_its_members_to_be\/","text":"I'm aware that the KGB's role in Soviet Russia was to collect information on the Russian population and suppress any dissent against the state within the country, but did KGB members themselves also have to be Marxist-Leninist or did they simply have to not oppose the state and aid it in its goals while working under it?","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678113822.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

They did so in a public announcement that claimed that the employment of German scientists had saved the United States several billion dollars in replicating their wartime R&D, and had sped up US research into rockets by 2 to 10 years. They also claimed that all Germans and Austrians had been screened for \"Nazi sympathies\" prior to recruitment, and claimed no \"active or fanatical\" Nazis had been accepted. \n\nAnyway, all of this was very widely-publicized, with stories in major newspapers. It was, essentially, not kept secret \u2014 though many of the details of individual's Nazi pasts were no doubt underemphasized. I don't know what caused them to decide to publicize it when they did (publicity and secrecy are two sides of a coin we might call information control) but I would note that it is not actually something that would be a good candidate for long-term secrecy. It would be impossible to integrate these scientists into things like American rocket research without a lot of people putting two and two together. The only way to imagine it would be to keep them essentially in closed cities, which was not only not how research was done after WWII in the USA, but also would probably impinge on the voluntary nature of the recruitment. The best candidates for secrets are things that are not obvious on the face of them; a bunch of German immigrants in 1945-1946 who were experts in rockets are pretty obviously going to be ex-Nazis. So in such a case it is better to spin it (they are helping the US, they are not really that Nazi, etc.) than to try and hide it.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678154916.0}]},{"title":"What's a good biography of Voltaire?","author":"LiminalApe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11jypai\/whats_a_good_biography_of_voltaire\/","text":"I'm looking for a biography of Voltaire in the style of Walter Isaacson's *Benjamin Franklin: An american life* and *Leonardo Da Vinci*, both of which I loved.

It was placed in the foundation of the Esagila, the grand temple of Marduk, in Babylon. Cyrus commissioned restoration work on the temple that included restoring some of the foundation, and there was a longstanding Mesopotamian tradition of interring cylinder inscriptions like this in the foundations of major temples. The last few lines of the Cyrus Cylinder actually describe this restoration work and reference how another foundation cylinder from the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal was uncovered and presented to Cyrus as part of the process:\n\n>Line 43: An inscription with the name of A\u0161\u0161urbanipal, a king who had preceded \\[me, I s\\]aw \\[in its midst\\]\n\nThe Cyrus Cylinder is a bit odd in the context of Mesopotamian foundation cylinders because it is so descriptive and detailed about Cyrus' accomplishments. Typically, these cylinders were pretty sparse, describing just the building project and maybe an abbreviated list of the king's accomplishments. However, it's not completely unique. Others like the Rassam Cylinder, also dedicated by Ashurbanipal, and the Nippur Cylinder of Nabonidus describe historical events in more detail as well.\n\nOnce placed in the building foundations they just remained there until the buildings were destroyed or collapsed unless they were accidentally uncovered by later restoration, as described above. The Cyrus Cylinder was found by the 19th Century Assyrian archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam in situ among the ruins of the Esagila apparently undisturbed since Cyrus the Great's time.\n\nHowever, copies of the same text were distributed in other formats. In 2010, archival work in the British Museum's extensive and largely untranslated Babylonian tablet collection [discovered two tablets](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110811123010\/http:\/\/www.britishmuseum.org\/the_museum\/news_and_press_releases\/statements\/cyrus_cylinder.aspx) with copies of the Cyrus Cylinder text. This confirmed pre-existing academic suspicions\/assumptions that the same declaration was distributed in some form, either to be read out in public or as an official record of Cyrus' greatness and conquest of Babylonia. Importantly, these tablets were not found in the city of Babylon itself, at least according to the museum's records. Instead they came from a nearby village, which implies that they were sent out across the surrounding area as part of Cyrus' official proclamation of victory in Babylon.\n\nGiven that the examples we have are both from a minor village, it's probably safe to assume that these copies were not put on public display either.

Churchill's hostility to Hitler was almost immediate and was due largely to his own philo-Semitism, which made the anti-Semitism of the Nazis all the more alarming. Churchill did not want a war but was no appeaser, calling for rapid rearmament in the early 1930s to challenge the danger of Germany. He understood that Hitler's aspirations of developing a militarised Germany which sought territorial expansion would be dangerous to European peace and to Britain's historical interests of seeing Europe free of any hegemonic power which would dominate the continent. \n\nFor a more expansive answer I will break this into two parts, addressing Churchill's view of Mussolini, then his attitude towards Hitler. \n\nChurchill's view of Mussolini: \n\nWe know that Churchill had concerns about Mussolini and the authoritarian nature of his regime but there are important differences between Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany. Fascist Italy maintained some of the 'traditional' systems that the Nazis had no interest in preserving, the monarchy remained in place in Italy and the Catholic church was supported within the state apparatus. These factors meant that Mussolini could be viewed more favourably to Conservatives in Europe compared to the fears of Communism. Churchill was similar to other British Conservatives in this regard, quickly accepting that Mussolini represented in the early 1920s a bulwark against Communism. The spread of Communism was something that alarmed most political leaders in Britain and France in the 1920s so this allowed Mussolini and Hitler (for other politicians in Britain and France in the early 1930s) to be accepted as a necessary evil to stop the 'Reds' growing their influence. \n\nAs to what Churchill said about Mussolini. In 1926 Churchill (then Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative Government of Stanley Baldwin) referred to Italy as respectable for settling its war debts with Britain and noted that \"It \\[Italy\\] possesses a Government under the commanding leadership of Signor Mussolini which does not shrink from the logical consequences of economic facts and which has the courage to impose the financial remedies required to secure and to stabilize the national recovery.\" (From the Complete Speeches of Winston Churchill, volume IV p. 3827). But as Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts notes, a few months after uttering these words Churchill told a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Belfast that Britain is not in a position that they would need to choose someone of such unconstitutional extremes. So we can see that Churchill viewed Mussolini as good for establishing order in Italy and holding back Communism but not as acceptable for an established constitutional democracy like Britain (Churchill would not likely think as highly of Italian democracy before Mussolini as it did not have the long historical tradition and institutional development that Britain, France or the United States had). \n\nClementine Churchill, and on a separate Mediterranean trip with his brothers, Winston did meet Mussolini. Yet, even here we have letters between Churchill and Clementine which show that while Churchill could acknowledge Mussolini was a remarkable leader of the time he noted that 'It is better to read about a world figure, than to live under his rule!' When Churchill met Mussolini he issued a press statement which praised Mussolini, again for his anti-communism (Churchill's detractors often only quote a small portion of the statement which says 'If I had been an Italian, I am sure I should have been whole-heartedly with you from the start to finish' but leave out the rest of the quote 'in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism.' It is important to note that Churchill said all this before Mussolini embarked on his war of conquest in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935 but whilst Italian communists and social democrats were subject to persecution. From this evidence Andrew Roberts and Martin Gilbert (two major Churchill biographers) conclude that Churchill's anti-communism blinded him towards the dangers of Mussolini which he would regret in the 1930s and 40s. So it is not really an embrace of fascism that attracted Churchill but the anti-communism as the spread of communism became a serious threat to Britain and the international system in Churchill's eyes.   \n\nWe can see Churchill uttering similar phrases regarding Japanese aggression in China in 1931 as justifiable due to Japanese disdain for communism (and memory of the old alliance between Japan and Britain which acted as bulwark against Russian, and later Soviet influence in Asia).","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678233240.0}]},{"title":"Sunday Digest | Interesting & Overlooked Posts | March 05, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ixtms\/sunday_digest_interesting_overlooked_posts_march\/","text":"[Previous](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22+OR+title%3A%22Day+of+Reflection%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nToday:\n\nWelcome to this week's instalment of [\/r\/AskHistorians](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians)' Sunday Digest (formerly the Day of Reflection).

Tomoyuki Yamashita had been the Japanese commander in the Philippines during 1944-45. He was tried by an American tribunal in the Philippines and sentenced to death. Yamashita sought review by the Supreme Court of the Philippines and then the U.S. Supreme Court.

It's not as well written as some other Wiki articles, but it's not a bad place to start in terms of basic information.) Your mom is wrong; Ukraine had an enormous Jewish population prior to the Holocaust, and Odessa was at one point more than 30% Jewish.\n\nWe know Jews lived in Bessarabia as early as 15th century, and probably before. By the early 19th century, there were as many as 20,000 Jews living there. Most lived in sizeable towns, but about 40% lived in villages. The Jewish population reached its peak in 1920, when the census reported 267,000 Jews in Bessarabia, comprising nearly 12% of the total population. Jews in the area were engaged in commerce, as inn-keepers, owners of or workers in distilleries, and workers in agriculture. They were also involved in the leasing of flourmills, fisheries, and forests. Some were also shepherds, water carriers, and engaged in trades like shoemaking or baking.\n\nThere were at times proscriptions on Jewish settlement, and pogroms (massacres) of Jews, including the notorious Kishinev pogroms in 1903 and 1905. But Jews continued to live in Bessarabia for many hundreds of years from the late middle ages on. The WWII years and the Holocaust had an enormous impact and virtually decimated Jewish life in the region during the 1940s, but following the war, Jewish life revitalized and the population began to rebound. However, the repression of the USSR eventually had a chilling effect on Jewish life, and those who could began to emigrate in the 1980s. By 2000, there were no more than 20,000 Jews in Moldova, many having immigrated to Israel (between 1989 and 2003, 42,000 Jews immigrated to Israel from Moldova).\n\nSo there aren't very many Jews left there today, but the area in general is a very rich site of Ashkenazi Jewish history.\n\nSources:\n\nFeldman, Eliahu. \"The Jews of Bessarabia from their arrival to the end of the 19th century\", [https:\/\/www.jewishgen.org\/yizkor\/pinkas\\_romania\/rom2\\_00279.html](https:\/\/www.jewishgen.org\/yizkor\/pinkas_romania\/rom2_00279.html)\n\nJignea, Clara, Kopansky, Yakov, and Shoikhet, Semion. \"The Jews of Moldova,\" in *Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova*, 1999.

It's because both Wikipedia and The World Population Review (USA Today's source) use terrible criteria to determine this.\n\nWikipedia does not explain where their 5300 BCE date comes from, and frankly I can't imagine why they chose it. There's no citation, limited explanation, and that predates the invention of writing by about 2000 years, let alone any expression of sovereignty or national identity. The one piece of information the Wiki chart does provide is that it's a date the editor associated with \"Founded by the Elamite.\" The Elamites were the first settled, urban society to emerge in modern Iran, centered in and around the area of modern Khuzestan and eventually Fars (the modern Iranian name for the province of Persia). 5300 predates the first evidence of any settlement at all in Susa, the first known Elamite city, by a century, and predates translatable written evidence of the first organized Elamite political powers by abut 3000 years. \n\nThe way I see it, there are two options. It could be a simple typo, 5300 instead of 4300, and reference the earliest settlement at Susa. Alternatively, 5300 BCE does line up with an inattentive or uncritically literal reading of the Sumerian King List. That list gives lengths of the reigns of the rulers of the dominant city-states in Bronze Age Sumer, and if you start with Lugal-Ane-Mundu of Adab in the 25th Century BCE and work backwards, the Elamite city of Awan is listed as a the dominant power about 2,900 years earlier. However, the earliest sections of the King List are a mixture of real individual, legends, and myths with many kings described as living for hundreds of years. It's not a realistic source of dating information.\n\nThe World Population Review at least [explains its methodology](https:\/\/worldpopulationreview.com\/country-rankings\/oldest-countries). Their list is based on the foundation of the earliest known organized government in the borders of the modern country. However they do not explain what constitutes an \"organized government\" and why Iran's Elamites qualify while the Iraq's Sumerian city state of Ur does not. Nor do they explain why they chose the dates used as the foundation for those first governments. 3200 BCE is a nice ballpark estimate of when Elamite cities like Susa and Awan first emerge as urban centers, but there is no evidence for a widespread Elamite state at the very least until c.2700 BCE, where the Awanite kings of the Sumerian King List would fall in a realistic reassessment of the documented kings in the early part of the list. The WPR also makes some extremely dubious claims like \"India, whose first civilization began approximately 10,000 years ago.\" That's 8000 BCE, before evidence of organized agriculture even appears in the region.\n\nRegardless of the accuracy of the dates used in either source, both ultimately come down to associating the earliest Elamite cities with the foundation of Iran as a state, which is utterly incorrect. No one Elamite city can be accurately described as the single progenitor of settled society in Iran, let alone imply some kind of continuity of government and sovereignty. The Elamites themselves were coqnuered and incorporated into foreign Empires many times, and completely vanish as a distinct identity by the 2nd Century BCE. At their height, the idea of Iran, a name that stems directly from an Indo-European cultural-linguistic group hadn't even reached the modern borders of Iran. That didn't happen until the 9th or 10th Century BCE, and when it did one of those Iranian groups, the Persians, eventually conquered and ruled Elam as foreign occupiers.\n\nIn the context of this question though, we should note that neither Wikipedia or USA Today and the WPR are not claiming that these dates are the start of territorial sovereignty, but organized state-level civilization. It's still an incredible stretch to argue that the *likely* emergence of city-states in Elam equates to Iran having the oldest civilization, but it isn't a claim of sovereign status.\n\nTo briefly address your sub-questions:\n\n1. The answer is, again, because the methodology used in both sources is bizarre and uncited. If Elamite urbanization qualifies Iran for a date in 4th or 5th Millennium BCE, the surely Iraq should qualify for an even earlier position with the early settlement of Ur beginning around 6500 BCE.\n2. Once again, since both of these lists fail to cite any sources to actually explain where their dates came from, I can't definitively explain anything. 2000 BCE just seems to be middle-range date for the Indus Valley Civilization even though conventional research is confident that it emerged about a thousand years earlier.","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1678072894.0}]},{"title":"[META] What are your most useful history books?","author":"Chantertwo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11izlja\/meta_what_are_your_most_useful_history_books\/","text":"Hello,\n\nI come from an academic background in English Literature. Recently I've been reading a lot more, especially history. In the English world, I'd often hear how important it was to read the right books. \n\nSo, I'm wondering what the \"right\" books are.

I've always been curious about Russian\/Soviet history, but I'm deeply skeptical of the texts I read, as they are from an American perspective, which I assume is pretty intensely biased. What books\/writers can I trust on this topic?\n\n2. Are there any books that write about the methodology of Soviet\/Russian history?

It's all the same methods, but of course working with different documentary sources. Specifically around *primary* sources in archives, I have written an answer detailing how those sources are accessed nowadays, [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/e17hts\/to_what_extent_were_soviet_archives_closed_off_in\/f8ntaiv\/). I'll turn back to methodology in a moment but let's go on to writers and books. \n\nFirst I'd say that there seems to be this widespread notion that you can't trust any books on Russia or the USSR because it's all propaganda of one type or another, and I must confess I find this a bit strange, because the reality is that academic history really has little to do with Cold War propaganda, especially in the three decades since the end of the Cold War. There are debates and schools, mind you, but most of the general facts are agreed upon and there's more areas of agreement than disputation. \n\nI'll also add that (and this feels like a rote thing to say here) *every* historian is biased in some degree, if in no other way in choosing the particular topics she writes about. With that said there are a few general caveats I would keep in mind. \n\nIf you can, stick with *academic historians*. They (or their grad students) are the ones who are doing the actual research, and the ones who are using historic methods, and also publishing in peer reviewed journals. They are also usually not the ones you see on bookshelves at Barnes and Noble or your bookstore of choice. \n\nWhat you see on the shelves more often than not is written by journalists or columnists, who at best are drawing on academic historians' research, perhaps providing their own journalistic observations or interviews, or at worst providing their own editorials not backed up by research at all. Into this category I'd put people like Robert Conquest, Anne Applebaum, David Remnick and Simon Sebag Montefiore. I've actually read all of them, they have won awards, and they have extremely gripping narratives, but they all suffer from one or more of the issues named above. \n\nIn second place I'd put cautions around people who are academic historians, but who are writing outside of their particular field of history, or not practicing good historic method. I'd put Timothy Snyder in this category (he's a historian of Poland, and he gets into trouble with other historians when he tries to explain other countries' history), or Richard Pipes (who was a good Russian historian in the 1950s, but was insanely political and flat-out refused to engage with the research done by younger Western historians, since he considered them all to be Soviet sell-outs - this is not good historic practice). \n\nI'd frankly stick to newer published histories - this sub has a 20 year rule, and I like to call it the \"Reverse 20 Year Rule\", although sometimes I'm charitable and bump it up to 30 years. Namely don't read anything *older* than 20 or 30 years ago. Much like u\/itsallfolklore writes, this is in no small part because you'll just get better bibliographies and bibliographical essays that the author will provide to explain their takes on earlier sources. If you read a 50 year old history book, you will just miss this completely. \n\nTo this end I would generally say: start with Stephen Kotkin, or Serhii Plokhy, or Sheila Fitzpatrick. Kotkin in particular has a massive two volume (soon hopefully three) biography of Stalin that has just come out, and covers not only his life but Russian and Soviet history through Stalin's lifetime. It's extremely new and addresses almost all of the contemporary research on these topics. The small print footnotes and bibliography run to a couple hundred pages in *each* volume, *but* it's a very engaging read - there's even an audiobook version. Kotkin is well within the academic mainstream, although there are a few points in his work that other historians argue with him about. \n\nPlokhy is also an academic historian, and boy is he *prolific* - he's written a history of the breakup of the USSR, a history of Ukraine, a history of Russia, a history of Chernobyl, and a history of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and that's just like half of the published books he's written in the past seven years alone. Again he like everyone has his biases, but he's pretty upfront about them and tries to be even handed, and walks you through the documentary evidence supporting his arguments. He's also very readable.\n\nSheila Fitzpatrick is kind of the Grand Dame of Soviet and Russian history. I'm including her because she has also written quite a bit on Soviet historiography, such as [this](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/4502285) and [this](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/27652945) essay - she has personally lived through quite a few of the debates and schools in Western academia on the subject. Her *Russian Revolution* is a good, short primer on the subject, and her book *Everyday Stalinism* is a read social history of city life in the 1930s, and her *On Stalin's Team* is a look at the leaders around the General Secretary during his years in charge.\n\nThere are a lot more authors I could recommend, even just for Soviet history alone - Orlando Figes' *A People's Tragedy* is probably the most popular book on the Russian Revolution written by an actual historian of Russia, Oleg Khlevniuk's *The History of the Gulag* is one of the most comprehensive works on that topic, and Ronald Grigor Suny's *The Soviet Experiment* is a literal introductory text on history from 1900 to 2000 in that region. I could go further into subfields (history of nationalities policy being a specialty of mine) but a lot of these can be found perusing the bibliographies of the books mentioned here.\n\nA few last thoughts and caveats: keep in mind that the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and Russian Federation get treated as the same thing (even by the current Russian government), but really are not, and specifically *Russian* history often leaves out obvious places like Ukraine, but also places like Armenia, Georgia, Turkmenistan, etc. Even a standard history of \"Russia\" won't necessarily tackle Jewish history, Arctic history, Siberian history, etc. These are all worthy historic topics to delve into on their own terms, and quite a few of the historians I have mentioned do so. \n\nI guess I would also just caution everyone to be aware of the continuing Cold War bias not so much in how the history is written, but in *what* history gets focused on. Often I feel like both in popular books and even in questions here you'd think Soviet history was just Spies, Nukes, Gulags and Famines. The mirror side of this in more hardline Marxist Leninist circles is usually \"The Bad Things the West Did to the USSR\", although these sorts of books are much more fringe (and I want to distinguish them from more legitimate academic research done by Marxist historians, although they're an ageing breed). These are all important topics, but that leaves out *loads* of other subjects that are worthy of study and do get written on, albeit not nearly as much. I've mentioned nationality\/national minorities' histories, but there are also cultural topics like Soviet cinema (or even really niche topics like the history of Indian cinema in the Soviet Union), or environmental history, or the history of women, etc. There are very interesting topics that get written about from that part of the world but they tend to get ignored in favor of \"important\" popular topics that all too often are influenced by what US foreign policy deemed\/deems important.","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678041036.0},{"author":"aquatermain","text":"For M\u00e9xico, I strongly recommend Jos\u00e9 Rabasa, especially his books on colonial historiography, and Matthew Restall, particularly his work on indigenous cultures as well as the early colonial period.

What books\/writers can I trust on this topic?\n\nIt's not an entirely unwarranted impulse given that an intense cold-war bias pervades much of the scholarship from 20-30 years ago. This perspective still has an enduring influence among certain historians today, which is often relitigated based on political events  I am unable to get into.  So-called \"Revisionist\" scholars such as Robert Thurston,  J. Archy Getty and Sheila Fitzpatrick, for instance, have correctly pushed back on historical narratives that, to varying extents, rely on myths or conceptions derived from highly politicized cold-war thinking.  To quote Lynne Viola:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Cold War binary thinking greatly simplified the study of Soviet history for American audiences.1  There were enemies (them) and there were friends (us, or some of us anyway). There were truth tellers (American historians) and there were liars (Soviet falsifiers). Factors of analysis and\/or causation could include determinism and inevitability (Lenin led to Stalin, October to 1937); wishful thinking and alternative scenarios of reality (if not for the war, if not for Stalin); and, if worse came to worse, accident and chance (Trotsky is ill). Best of all, there were no sources. As a consequence and a career builder for those whose moonlight calling was to serve Democracy in a governmental role a great American success story unfolded as depictions of the enemy rebounded in an automatically positive way on the friend. American history was written onto a canvas of Soviet history, with the latter showing through and, paradoxically and sometimes damningly, helping to shape the textures, tones, and colors of the canvas.\n\nPopular works of history by writers\/historians like Sean Mcmeekin, Timothy Snyder, Anne Applebaum are still deeply shaped by this outdated kind of thinking but are immensely popular for reasons unrelated to historical accuracy and more to do with contemporary events, ideology, and political grievance. No historian is free from bias, but the reliability of a work of history can become completely compromised by this.\n\nSome of my favourite historians are those who have challenged pervading myths of the cold war perspective based on rigorous archival research. Historians like Michael Jabara Carley, Geoffrey Roberts, Chris Bellamy, David Glantz, Alfried Rieber, to name a few, do not let the Soviets off the hook for it's mass repressions and violence, but are not afraid to acknowledge positive aspects of the USSR, if that is where the evidence leads.\n\nViola, Lynne.

This reputation comes from the theory proposed by Hastings Rashdall for the origins of the University of Oxford in his magisterial *The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages*. Rashdall's argument begins from the assumption that a northern European university could not have emerged spontaneously without a sufficiently large ecclesiastical institution like Notre Dame in Paris. He therefore takes it as a given that we must search for the origins of the University of Oxford \"ab extra\" through the exodus of scholars from another educational centre. The only plausible candidate for such an exodus in the twelfth century is of course Paris and, as he discusses a few pages later, this must have occurred around the third quarter of the twelfth century as until then no more than one master can be found teaching in Oxford at any given time, and of course \"a single master does not make a university.\"^1 So the cumulative implication here is that an exodus of English scholars from Paris must have occurred roughly around the time of the Becket controversy in the 1160s.\n\nWith that goal in mind, Rashdall finds the basis for a highly speculative story about the foundation of a *studium generale* in Oxford through two ostensibly unrelated bits of evidence: A cryptic remark in a letter of John of Salisbury about the expulsion of foreign students from Paris in 1167 and a set of statutes that Henry II promulgated around 1169 as an attempt to limit the influence of the exiled Thomas Becket on the English clergy. \n\nRashdall has to perform some significant contortions to line these two up. On the one hand, John of Salisbury doesn't tell us what Rashdall want's to find, that Henry II recalled the English students from Paris. Rather, after John spends the majority of the letter discussing the Becket controversy, he notes that God has shown favor on his church as not only has Frederick Barbarossa given up his siege of Rome but Henry II has not headed his wicked advisors. This leads him to note that, if we are to believe the astrologers, the position of Mercury heralds a tumultuous year:\n\n>> While I don't put any stock in these empty visions, they do seem hold true at least in part, for various councillors of the Emperor have died: Rainald archbishop of Cologne, and the usurper of Mainz, the bishops of Li\u00e8ge and Regensburg, and many schismatic princes. Wars and sedition were aroused everywhere and Mercury was so low that France, the mildest and most civilized of all nations, expelled the foreign-born scholars. (Ep. 225; my trans.)\n\nOn the other hand, Henry's statutes are neither from the right year nor really about recalling scholars from France. The most recent editors describe the eight or so provisions thusly, with Rashdall citing the two bolded entries:\n\n>> Anyone found with a letter from pope or archbishop declaring an interdict on England is to be treated as a traitor; **no clerk or monk or the like is to cross the sea without an official letter, on pain of imprisonment**; there is to be no appeal to pope or archbishop, and no sending or receiving of mandates from or to those authorities; anyone willing to obey a sentence of interdict is to be exiled with his whole kin; the chattels of all who support pope or archbishop are confiscate; **all clerks with revenues in England are to return to the country on pain of sequestration**; Peter's pence is to be gathered into the royal treasury, not sent to the pope; the bishops of London and Norwich are to be amerced, and charged before the royal justices to answer for laying an interdict on the lands of the earl of Norfolk contrary to the Constitutions of Clarendon, and for promulgating the pope's excommunication of the earl in their sees without the king's licence.^2\n\nRashdall is forced to insist on the significance of John's rather vague remark by insisting that the association of this expulsion with the retreat of Barbarossa from Rome suggests that it must have been an event \"of European importance.\"^3 Likewise, while he concedes that the best sources date Henry's promulgation to 1169, other later sources date them to 1164 or 1165, so like maybe they had \"really ... been issued on a different date [like say] towards the close of 1167, when John of Salisbury's Letter must have been written [\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af].\"^4 \n\nSuffice it to say, and in answer to your second question, this argument is a stretch. It faced immediate criticism by Rashdall's contemporaries and the editors of the posthumous 3 volume reissue of his work (which includes a compilation of some of the spicier controversy to Appedix 1) felt the need to add new footnotes in this section of the text further qualifying Rashdall's reading of these sources.^5 And that more or less captures the tone of every scholar that I've been able to find who has looked at the matter with any modicum of care. This is highlighted really nicely by the scholarly output of Gillian Evans, who includes the Henry II\/1167 story in the introduction to her 2005 biography of Wylif, but rather poignantly omits any comment about the year 1167 in her 2010 history of Oxford University.^6\n\nBesides the noted evidentiary problems, Rashdall also overstates the significance of Oxford in the twelfth century.^7 The reality is that in 1167 there is no reason to imagine that Oxford would have been the only or even necessarily the central place that a Parisian exile would have turned. Notably, we still have references to Northampton as the preeminent school for the Liberal Arts in England into the 1180s.\n\nBut, returning at last to the first question, we shouldn't entirely dismiss John of Salisbury's comment. As we can see, there is no reason to think that this expulsion, if it happened, had anything directly to do with either Henry or Becket. While I've not been able to find any especially compelling discussion of this particular point (though I've not been able to check the OMT edition of the letter, so if there's anything relevant to add there, I'll update the thread in a few days when I've been able to get a hold of the library's copy), the standard interpretation seems to be that this has to do with the war that broke out between Henry II and Louis VII that summer, with the suggestion that Louis thought that a large presence of English scholars in the royal capital might represent a liability. That being said, much like the scholarly assessment of Henry's 1169 ordinances, significant skepticism remains about whether this putative expulsion of foreign students ever actually came into force or had any real effect if it did.^8 We certainly don't have the evidence to suggest that it was the considerable movement of scholars that Rashdall wanted it to be.\n\n---\n\n1: Hastings Rashdall, *The Universities Of Europe In The Middle Ages* (repr. 1936) iii.22.

It was one of the key ways of doing so and slave raids around the Mediterranean continued for centuries, but it should not be discounted that there was a thriving international trade of slaves that arose in part due to the end of organized Islamic military expansion, as well as the conquest and conversion of much of Europe to Christianity. That isn't to say that slave raiding ceased among them entirely in favor of trade, it didn't, but demand could potentially be met through other means.\n\nBoth Christianity and Islam shared the notion that they should not enslave coreligionists. As a result, in the Early Medieval Period Christian and Muslim areas favored Slavic slaves due to their association with paganism (it should be noted that even Slavs who had converted to Christianity by this point were still targeted due to this association). Archeologists and historians have identified a large area stretching from the Elbe River in modern day Germany and Czechia all the way to the western parts of what is now Russia in which there is evidence of depopulation as well as numerous ringed forts with implements used in slavery such as shackles and pits. Scandinavian merchants and raiders played a key role in this trade alongside others such as the Magyars, with groups like the Khazars forming a middleman in the trade of slaves towards the Middle East and Central Asia in the East. Islamic silver dirhams have been found by archaeologists in large numbers throughout this area, as they were one of the primary goods used in the slave trade as well as trade for more mundane things like furs. Bohemia played a central role in this slave trade going south towards Italy (and Venice in particular) and west towards Iberia, where Slavic slaves were in high demand in part due to their popularity in the Abbasid Caliphate core.\n\nWhile the Black Sea trade of slaves already existed by this point, it steadily grew in importance until the Late Medieval Period and the Renaissance. Circassians, Tatars, and even Russians among others were still targeted for their association with paganism, whether or not they actually were. Genoese colonies in Crimea exported numerous slaves to Italy and Iberia, but slaves were also taken in large numbers to Anatolia and Egypt. Egypt during this time period was ruled by the Mamluks, themselves military slaves commonly (but not exclusively) taken from around the Black Sea. Sudanese slaves were also taken into Egypt over land via slave raids by Egyptians, which went on well into the 19th century despite the fact that by that point the peoples of Sudan were overwhelmingly Islamic. When British-backed courts in Egypt started to prosecute this slave trade, some members of Egyptian society seemed shocked to learn that the Sudanese had been Islamic this whole time.

I'd love to hear the citation for the claim made in the question, if the OP is willing to share it, partly because I can't think of a significant scholarly work that makes this claim.\n\nPart of the reason is that the spread of Islam in West Africa shows no sign, as far as I can tell, of being \"deliberately checked\". Rudolph Ware's *The Walking Qur'an* is the most detailed account of Islam's spread in the region, but there's considerable attention to it in other recent major works, most notably Michael Gomez' *African Dominion.* The basic picture is that Islam disseminated through the region starting from about the 9th Century from merchants and scholars (what Ware calls a \"clerisy\", not appointed officials of a religious hierarchy, but people with specialized knowledge and an intent to proselytize ) rather than through military action. This is not so much a \"checking\" as a recognition that the forces which moved into the Maghreb earlier didn't have the specialized knowledge or capacity to traverse the caravan routes across the Sahara, which were largely in control of Berber-speaking groups like the Tuareg. \n\nThe conversion of Berber populations to Islam was somewhat fraught, and to a significant extent only took place in a lasting way through the same kind of merchant-focused approach that became typical in West Africa, over a century or more. At the other end of the trans-Saharan trade, Muslim clerisy found that beyond Berber and Fulani-speaking pastoralist groups they generally made inroads only in the courts of the states of the Middle Niger and in nearby Mande-speaking or Mande-influenced chiefdoms and states to the west and southwest of the Middle Niger region, at least at first.\n\nRulers and their courts were trying to balance fidelity to indigenous spiritual traditions and ideas that were important for the maintenance of popular legitimacy and useful ruling institutions like hunter brotherhoods with performances of Islamic piety sufficient to please the merchant and scholar clerisy, particularly the scholars who took root in the larger cities and settlements of the Middle Niger like Timbuktu, Gao and Kumbi Saleh. More than anything else, that was the \"check\" on the expansion of Islam--many settled communities of farmers, fishers, etc., were wary of Islamic preaching but also had relatively little contact with merchants and scholars who \"walked\" the religion into the region. \n\nOver time, smaller communities began to convert more substantially, particularly in Senegambia, where a distinct Sufi-influenced clerisy known as *marabouts* took hold. This is where the next point relevant to the OP's question arises. Islam does instruct pious rulers and others to avoid enslaving the faithful, and justifies slavery as a strategy for religious conversion, but the fact is that both in the trans-Saharan trade and in the intensifying Atlantic slave trade after 1650, this was at best an unevenly applied or acknowledged principle. Islamic clerisy involved in long-distance trade with an interest in acquiring slaves had little difficulty ignoring that some of the people they were trading were Muslims. Michael Gomez argues in *African Dominion* that this is partly because an early form of quasi-racial distinction was being developed in the Middle Niger world by Islamic travellers like ibn Battuta that allowed Muslims involved in long-distance trade to regard enslaved people as lesser--or as \"not quite Muslims\" even if they were nominally part of the religion. But it's also partly because as the demand for slaves rose, especially through the Atlantic trade, larger or more centralized states increased their raiding of neighboring communities whose more important attribute from the perspective of the raiders was that they were strangers--whether they were also nominally Muslims didn't matter so much.\n\nThis appears to be the central issue that produced the so called \"Fula jihads\" of the second half of the 18th Century and early 19th Century across West Africa, most famously that of Usman dan Fodio, which led to the creation of the Sokoto Caliphate. Led by Fulani-speaking Muslims but often bringing together ordinary Muslims speaking different languages within Senegambia and the Niger from the sahel down into the savannah of what is now northern Nigeria, the central force behind these movements was the resentment of pious Muslim commoners at rulers, princes and elite cavalry who were perceived as being corrupt and ignore the commandment to spare Muslims from enslavement.","upvotes":23,"created_utc":1678026401.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678065579.0}]},{"title":"Did Socrates only attract\/admit students from wealthy backgrounds?","author":"Sjosavnid","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11j1k4v\/did_socrates_only_attractadmit_students_from\/","text":"Both Plato and Xenophon, as far as I understand, are from wealthy \"aristocratic\" background.

It was not a position solely for the foolish or uneducated. PhD holders from the South and Confederate sympathizers\/descendants wrote essays, dissertations, and books either arguing the specific Lost Cause narrative or taking it as a given. President Woodrow Wilson, a Southern history PhD and president of Princeton University before going into politics, is probably our most notable example.\n\nThey did not restrict themselves to publications, either. Southern historical societies (which were mostly non-academics by membership and really large organizations) gave these historians platforms for speeches and lectures on the subject. They received research funding from the Daughters of the Confederacy and other similar Lost Cause organizations. \n\nIt was still a controversial position, however, as historians from the North and western states often loudly disagreed and presented their own academic rebuttals. The Lost Cause was sometimes taught at schools and universities beyond the South, but not universally as it was in southern schools.\n\nHistorically Black universities were usually the loudest in rebuttals against the Lost Cause. Scholars like WEB DuBois were very thorough in their efforts to disprove this narrative and were often cited by white scholars trying to do the same.\n\nThe Lost Cause did not cease to be a serious historical position until the Civil Rights movement, when the Lost Cause was greeted by the academic community as a moral and ethical question\/issue rather  than an academic one. \n\nSources:\n\n- Charles Reagan Wilson, ed. *The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 4: Myth, Manners, and Memory.* University of North Carolina Press, 2006.","upvotes":23,"created_utc":1678029240.0},{"author":"yonkon","text":"Building on the answer from u\/DarthNetflix, I hope you wouldn\u2019t mind me taking your question in a slightly different direction. \n\nThere were certainly a lot of historians who claimed that the Civil War wasn\u2019t caused by slavery - but these claims are today relatively easy to dispel given the monumental amount of primary sources from the South positing that the defense of human bondage was very much the underlying driver of the sectarian conflict. \n\nA more pernicious historical narrative associated with the \u201cLost Cause\u201d that modern scholars have struggled to combat is one that portrays the Antebellum South as an idyllic - albeit declining - agrarian country; and that the \u201cdeath\u201d of this place was hastened by industrial interests that wanted to commodify and commercialize what had been a \u201cway of life.\u201d \n\nThis narrative undergirds comments (and implicit suggestions that lie just under the surface) that you often see in online discussions whenever the history of American slavery appears:\n\n* Slavery had existed throughout history (ergo, it was not morally odious for the American South - a place that was struggling to keep up with the times - to have had slavery)\n* The North was just as culpable for slavery (because the backward South had less agency than the industrialized North which proactively induced demand for cotton from the plantations).\n* The North did not care about abolition (because they were controlled by industrial interests that were only interested in a different kind of exploitation).\n\nThis historical narrative arose in the 1920s just as Jim Crow laws were securely cemented in southern states and statues of Confederate generals were being erected across the country (Robert E. Lee Monument in Charlottesville went up in 1924).\n\nAs part of sanitizing the image of the Confederacy, historians sympathetic to the South had to reconcile 1) the undeniable reality that the North was better able to mobilize resources for the war, and; 2) the conviction that the South was not responsible for the tremendous bloodletting that had taken place on the edges of living memory. \n\nAt this time, Georgia-born historian Ulrich Bonnell Phillips put forward the thesis that slavery was an economically moribund system in a rapidly industrializing world. \n\nAbolitionists had made similar appeals to Southern planters prior to the Civil War, arguing that forced labor was an impediment to industrialization - but the twist Phillips introduced to the narrative was that slavery was facing its own obsolescence because it was inefficient. Taking this thesis to the next step, Texas-based historian Charles Ramsdell went on to argue that the sacrifices of the Civil War were made in vain: the South would have abolished slavery out of their own self-interest. The implication was that the Civil War had caused untold destruction for no purpose.\n\nPhillips and Ramsdell helped craft an image of a genteel and rural society that was vanishing in the face of dark satanic mills - the prophesized collapse merely hastened by an unnecessary war. And this narrative of obsolescence helped absolve the South's culpability in the war and found its way into popular media portrayals like *Gone with the Wind*.\n\nVariations of these analyses act as foundations for persistent Lost Cause arguments today. \n\nThis remained a dominant historical narrative until Alfred Conrad and John Meyers' 1958 book *The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South* blew a hole in Phillips and Ramsdell's core thesis. Examining the accounting books of antebellum plantations, they found that slavery - far from facing an existential threat - had remained incredibly lucrative for planters until the shelling of Fort Sumter. \n\nRemaining doubts about slavery's profitability were laid to rest in 1974 when economists Stanley Engerman and Robert Fogel published *Time on the Cross*. Not only were slave plantations profitable, as Conrad and Meyers had uncovered, Fogel and Engerman also found that they were more efficient than smaller Southern farms that relied on free labor.\n\nDirectly excoriating Ramsdell's claim, *Time on the Cross* decisively concluded that there was no economic rationale for the voluntary abolition of slavery by the planter class. Ergo - slavery would have continued in the South had there not been a Union victory in the Civil War.\n\n(1\/2)","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678210827.0}]},{"title":"Was There Ever Any Place, Any Time When People Drank Beer Instead of Water for Safety Reasons?","author":"LongtimeLurker916","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11j7ig0\/was_there_ever_any_place_any_time_when_people\/","text":"To be more in strict adherence to the rules of the sub, maybe I should rephrase as \"Is there any reason that notorious myth could actually have been true in colonial New England?\"\n\nI know that this is a frequently-answered b\u00eate noire on this sub, but answers generally mention the Middle Ages specifically.

That's a big thing to imagine changing, though perhaps not always as big as people imagine. How exactly did nuclear weapons factor into US and Soviet thinking when it came to possible aggressive postures? One has to often read between the lines, because rarely did any document record something along the lines of, \"if they didn't have nukes, we'd surely attack!\" And even if a document _did_ record such a sentiment, one cannot take such things at face value, either, because they are themselves counterfactuals. (\"If I had a billion dollars, I'd try to give it all away,\" says a history professor on Reddit without a billion dollars, who has no idea what he would actually do if he had a billion dollars, because that would be a qualitatively different experience than any he has ever had.)\n\nWe can't even really \"prove\" that nuclear deterrence does or doesn't work. We can infer it might be a reason that certain types of activities \u2014 like the non-use of nuclear weapons in war after 1945 \u2014\u00a0but there are other plausible and possible explanations as well. So, for example, nuclear deterrence _doesn't_ explain why the US didn't use nuclear weapons in the Korean War (the Soviet nuclear arsenal was functionally nonexistent at that point), and doesn't explain why the US didn't wage a war with the Soviets before 1949. There are other explanations for these things, to be sure; it is not a mystery, just the sort of thing that requires more careful analysis than what non-historians tend to come up with (for example, the non-use in the Korean War had much to do with Truman's own post-1945 aversion to the use of nuclear weapons, a fear of alienating allies and the UN, and a fear of conventional escalation with China \u2014 all things one can establish fairly \"solidly,\" as opposed to an idea about nuclear deterrence, which one has to sort of infer vaguely). This doesn't mean that nuclear weapons didn't change thinking in these situations \u2014 it is hard to imagine that they did not. But it is very hard to demonstrate simple causal relationships with them, in part, again, because it relies on counterfactual arguments.\n\nAnyway. The US military certainly did make _plans_ for what World War III would look like. That is their job \u2014 to prepare for all manner of future conflicts, and they very strongly believed that war with the Soviet Union was a highly plausible scenario during the Cold War. They even made plans for what a first-strike attack by the US on the Soviets would look like, in the event that such a thing was deemed necessary or the lesser of two evils (e.g., if it was clear that the Soviets were about to attack, there would be a huge advantage in \"going first\"). This does not mean that the military was actually going to _do_ any of these things, certainly not on their own initiative. The US Cold War posture, especially after the Soviet acquisition of nuclear weapons, was to have extremely-credible (in that they could actually be quickly executed) plans in place to wage total war against the USSR. The idea was that having such plans in place would possibly prevent the USSR from doing things that might provoke the US, but also that in the event of changing circumstances, the plans might be something that could be carried out. That would need to be ordered by the President at the very least, however. \n\nOne might ask, what about the period before the Soviets got nuclear weapons? E.g., from 1945-1949 or so (or even several years beyond, when the Soviet nuclear arsenal and capabilities were so small that one could realistically hope to knock them out before they were delivered, and their targeting ability was limited to areas very close to the USSR), during the period of American atomic monopoly. One does not find in this period a great enthusiasm for invading the USSR; if anything, the Truman administration was trying to cut back on military deployments in an effort to fully reconvert to a \"peacetime\" economy, to the anger and frustration of the military. The Soviet acquisition of the atomic bomb halted that, and accelerated US military funding and deployments, both as a result of the bomb and as a result of the beginning of the Korea War the next year. So if anything, in this period the Soviet acquisition of nuclear weapons probably increased the chances of the US waging war against them, rather than decreasing it. \n\nAnyway. It is an easy thing for people to make vague and broad statements about the impact of nuclear weapons on history. It is much harder to actually substantiate them!","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678120676.0}]},{"title":"What is the Flag of saint Sigismund of Burgundy?","author":"King-Aldrik","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11jf2he\/what_is_the_flag_of_saint_sigismund_of_burgundy\/","text":"I cant find it anywhere and I dont know","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678053150.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

I am a specialist on 20th century American political history, so my answer is going to come from that standpoint, but if you asked, an economist or a historian of postwar Britain, you'd probably get a very different answer. So, with that in mind, I'll give my perspective while also acknowledging that there is always more to be said. \n\nSo first off, how do we define exactly what neoliberalism is? There's been literal books written about this topic, but to be concise let's say that it is on some level, a guiding political and economic system that prizes free markets as organizing principle behind social prosperity. In this vision, the market, rather than, say, the government, should be allowed to operate and regulate public life. So, policies like privatization, austerity, free trade, and deregulation all fall under this umbrella because on some level they reflect the idea that markets should be allowed to operate with as little interference as possible, and that government should play a role in assuring this independence.\n\nBut obviously behind something as consequential as neoliberalism is a ton of other social and political ideas as well, and this is where we get into the meat of your question. The ideas of neoliberalism had roots long before America and the world's embrace of it - Friedrich Hayek is probably the most famous of these intellectuals. But even though these ideas existed in circulation, neoliberalism really didn't take hold of socio-political life until around the 1970s. Before that, like you said, American life fit into what some historians now call \"the New Deal order.\" The New Deal order describes the socio-political consensus from around the 1930s into the 1970s. In a lot of ways it was an economic system built around Keynesian ideas that government spending could serve as an antidote to economic hardship. But this way of organizing the economy also had profound impacts on social and political life as well. The New Deal saw the early creation of the American welfare state, first with policies like social security and then later developments like Medicare and Medicaid. It saw organized labor as a strong force in social, political, and economic life, whose negotiations with capital assured cycles of mass production and consumption. For a long time this order operated with a relatively bipartisan consensus. Until Barry Goldwater in 1964 (and he lost in a landslide), even the Republican Party tended to marginalize its most conservative, anti-government members. \n\nSo what changed? What motivated Americans to turn away from this system of public spending and government welfare toward policies of deregulation and free market ideals? Well, let's start with the economy. Firstly, the stagflation of the 1970s played a central role. Until this point, (post Great Depression at least) America had dealt with its economic downturns in similar, Keynesian fashions: basically pumping money into the economy on the belief it would stimulate economic activity. Stagflation threw a damper into this. The mix of unemployment and inflation cast doubt on the supposed certainty that inflationary economic policies would yield higher growth. Instead, such spending only promised more inflation. This was the first crack in the Keynesian consensus. So how did the nation deal with stagflation? Well, for one, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, raised interest rates. This had an adverse effect on unemployment, but Volcker resolved to solve the problem of inflation first. In some ways his policy was successful in its goal, but it also had spillover effects. By raising interest rates (which worsened unemployment), Volcker's policy dealt a blow to organized labor; with a weak labor market, unions lost their power. This economic shift was also accompanied by a political shift away from sympathy for labor (think Reagan firing the striking air traffic controllers in 1981). \n\nSo basically what we see so far is economic circumstances dealing a blow to the economic principles that undergirded the New Deal Order. But the economic context also had impacts on social and political life. The impact of Volcker's policies meant that labor, maybe *the* central group in the New Deal Coalition, was weakened both as an economic and political force. This was just one shift, but it portended a much larger change.\n\nOn the political side of things, neoliberalism seemed an appealing alternative to the consensus that had come before not just because of the circumstances of stagflation, but also because of shifting attitudes toward the concept of government in American life. The alliance between social conservatism and free market economics is probably the most important political arrangement of the last 50 years, and on its face it's a bit confusing. What unites the two? Well, if you look back to the New Deal Order, a central idea undergirding this system was a faith in public institutions. The New Deal and subsequent decades saw the massive expansion of government bureaucracy, a huge increase in its economic apparatus and a fundamental shift in how people conceived government in their daily lives. By the 1970s, however, some people started to lose faith. There had always been those who opposed the New Deal from a business or anti-government standpoint, but those ideas started to become mainstream over time. Regions like the South jumped from Democratic to Republican as figures like Goldwater and Nixon used anti-government language to appeal to their anti-civil rights sentiments (if you're interested in learning more, look up the Southern Strategy, though I could write another answer entirely about that concept...). Additionally, there were big backlashes from the Right against groups like the Black Panthers, second wave feminists, students in the New Left. A lot of people considered these movements signs of social unrest and decay. But how does this relate back to neoliberalism? Let's look at an example.\n\nPhyllis Schafly was a major figure in the movement of social conservatism that burgeoned in the 1970s and 80s. She led the fight against the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, and is probably the single individual most responsible for its demise. Look at what she says in one of her most famous speeches, \"What's Wrong with 'Equal Rights' for Women?\": \n\n\"Our respect for the family as the basic unit of society, which is ingrained in the laws and customs of our Judeo-Christian civilization, is the greatest single achievement in the entire history of women\u2019s rights... A woman can enjoy real achievement when she is young\u2014by having a baby. She can have the satisfaction of doing a job well\u2014and being recognized for it. Do we want financial security? We are fortunate to have the great legacy of Moses, the Ten Commandments, especially this one: \u201cHonor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land.\u201d Children are a woman\u2019s best social security\u2014her best guarantee of social benefits such as old age pension, unemployment compensation, workman\u2019s compensation, and sick leave. The family gives a woman the physical, financial and emotional security of the home\u2014for all her life.\"\n\nHere, Schafly argues that the ERA, by changing norms around divorce, alimony, child support, etc., will lead to the destruction of the family unit in American life. But look how she connects it to economic circumstances: \"Children are a woman's best social security.\" She's using the family to critique the influence of government and public life on people's private affairs and sense of (often religious) morality. This is something that Melinda Cooper in her book *Family Values* writes about, basically arguing that social conservatism and free market ideas mixed because of a belief that the American welfare state was detrimental to private life and to the unit of the family. Cooper talks a lot about the inheritance tax in particular and the belief that it hindered generational family prosperity, but this captures a big part of the neoliberal-conservative alliance. The argument went that instead of relying on welfare, people should take personal responsibility; government should create avenues for economic success, but should not play an active role. Whether or not you like this idea will depend on your politics, but at the time it seemed appealing to many. Faith in government was at a low, not just because of stagflation, but also because of Vietnam, and then later scandals like Watergate. More and more people came to lose faith in the government's ability to assure prosperity in social, political, and economic life. So, when charismatic figures like Reagan come along, there was already a huge market (no pun intended) for the supply-side ideas he promoted and the belief that free economic activity could assure widespread prosperity.\n\nSorry for the absurdly long answer; this is an absurdly complex question. TLDR: in the US, stagflation and other economic crises cast doubt on the Keynesian belief that government activity could assure economic prosperity. Combining that with a broader rise of social conservatism and loss of faith in government, the groundwork was laid for a political alliance that would replace New Deal norms and bring about the subsequent neoliberal order.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1678079076.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678043136.0}]},{"title":"Since when do humans understand that thinking and experiencing occur in the brain?

Is this true?\n\nAlmost certainly not. We don't know the answer for certain, since the written record of fish sauces is quite poor. However, three things should be noted:\n\n1. Fermentation for the production of beer and wine spread across Eurasia and Africa in prehistoric times - fermentation was a familiar technology. (It was also independently developed in the Americas).\n\n2. While garum and SE Asian fish sauce the best-known (in the West) fish sauces today, there are plenty of other fish\/seafood sauces\/pastes. These are used, for example, on the east and west coasts of Africa, in the Middle East, in South Asia, and more. Native American fermented fish foods suggest that it isn't particularly difficult to invent them.\n\n3. Roman (and Greek) fish sauce is far from the earliest known. Fermented fish sauces were known and used in Mesopotamia by about 4,000 years ago, and possibly have a long history and pre-history before then.\n\nSince Roman and SE Asian fish sauce aren't the earliest known examples, and fish sauce and similar foods are very widely-spread geographically, it's improbable that either SE Asia or the Mediterranean were where such foods originated (it's possible, but there are so many other place where they could have first developed).\n\nThere's the further question, which we also can't answer, of whether the wide variety of fish sauces\/pastes out there developed independently, or whether they spread from one or a few centres of origin. Since fish sauce was already used in East Asia during the early Han Dynasty (along with a wide range of fermented sauces using various mammal meats, and other animals), if the Romans are to be given the credit, they must have achieved it long before the Roman state had direct access to the Indian Ocean.\n\nFor more on the little history we know of fish sauces, see my past answer in:\n\n* https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/cv8ij1\/is_there_a_historical_connection_between_roman\/\n\nFor ancient Mesopotamian fish sauces, see *siqqu* in:\n\n* Bott\u00e9ro, Jean. \u201cThe Cuisine of Ancient Mesopotamia.\u201d The Biblical Archaeologist 48, no. 1 (1985): 36\u201347. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2307\/3209946 https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3209946","upvotes":81,"created_utc":1677996056.0},{"author":"Haikucle_Poirot","text":"I'm not familiar with the source the answer cited so I can't tell you why he said that.\n\nYes, fish sauce is part of Indian cuisine, especially south and northeastern (Bengal.)  \"India\" could have meant anywhere from Western Iran\/Pakistan onwards.  And by the time the Roman empire existed, India had expanded its influence to SE Asia through religion and trade.\n\nTo learn more about fish sauce and its traditional production in SE Asia,  here's a Journal of Ethnic Foods article explaining its benefits.\n\n**\"Fermented fish products in South and Southeast Asian cuisine: indigenous technology processes, nutrient composition, and cultural significance\"**   Journal of Ethnic Foods. [https:\/\/journalofethnicfoods.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s42779-021-00109-0](https:\/\/journalofethnicfoods.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s42779-021-00109-0)\n\nFermentation is a way to process and preserve food without heat; evidence for it may be tens of thousands years old. Fermentation is found all over the world.\n\nOne culture which uses fermentation to untold heights-- raising the very real question if that part of the world was where fermentation originally developed as a deliberate culinary practice-- is in South Sudan where the dry season is very long and hard and people are at risk of dying of starvation every year.\n\nEven today,  poor Sudanese  scramble to preserve, dry, and ferment everything and anything that could provide calories for the dry season, including dairy (kefir type drinks, cheeses, etc.),  balls of ground-up bones, grains for alcohol, locusts, beans, and other things we'd consider to be inedible in any form.  And yes, they dry and ferment fish, make fish paste and sauce, too-- but from freshwater Nile fish.  Not saltwater fish, as garum is made from.  Traditional methods there may use salt or none.\n\nNote: nearby Ethiopia\/Eritrea has a long and varied fermentation tradition, too, but I have seen no documentation of any fermented fish sauces from there as of yet.  Egypt, though, has *fesikh*, a traditional celebratory dish of dried, fermented grey mullet eaten at the festival of \\*Sham el-Nessim (\\*which has been celebrated since 2,700 BCE.)\n\nThe Greeks were making *garos* by the 3-4th century BCE, and Chinese records mention  fermented sauces with fish parts, meat and beans around the same time. (Eventually the Chinese would switch to soy-only sauces for preference.)\n\nAnd... the earliest fish fermentation site of any sort was found in Sweden, dated to 9,800-8,900 years before present!  Most of the fish bones found were of roach, a particularly bony fish which is hard to eat fresh. [https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0305440316000170](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0305440316000170)\n\nGiven all this history, it's quite unlikely Romans pioneered the art of fermented fish sauce any more than the French invented the concept of making soup from fish heads.\n\nThe ethnic food article linked above mentions that SE Asia was also a hub of salt production-- key for making salty fish sauce,  and sun, and sea, and China already had fermented fish-meat-soy sauces.   So, Fish sauce is extremely unlikely to have been a novelty there.\n\nBut the Roman empire did have sun, fish, salt and good conditions for mass fermentation-- dry hot summers, ample variety of ingredients, fish or herbal. They may simply have mastered the art of garum and had lots of it to trade.\n\nThis would have been extra-true after conquering Egypt, which source say facilitated trade with India.  It would also have led to increased access to salt from the Sahara.\n\nIn Africa, the Sahara, which covers the northern part of Sudan, is the source of salt for much of Africa-- the trans-Saharan trade moved a lot of salt to the salt-poor West Africa.\n\nIndia itself has a 5,000 year old history of collecting salt from the marshes on its west coast-- the Rann of Kutch.\n\nIt's not clear they or SE Asia NEEDED salt per se from the Roman empire, even though salt historically has been a much coveted and pricey item of trade. Salt isn't found everywhere and it's essential to health. We are wired to love salt (and eat too much of it.)   It also helps preserve food, as well, and fish spoils easily.   Fish is popular, cheap protein if you can catch it locally.  Transporting or waiting too long to eat fish has always been a major issue.\n\nSo salting (and\/or fermenting) fish is a logical thing to do, particularly as fish and salt often come from the same place-- the sea.\n\nFish contains protein, flavor, omega-3 acids, iron and other essential minerals-- especially iodine (especially low-fat saltwater fish, which Romans used as well as the oily anchovy.)   Sea salt does not have much iodine on its own.\n\nMany inland areas are iodine-poor in their soils, with ongoing health impacts.  So inlanders, before refrigeration would take seafood how they could get it (which is actually the explanation for why Hongeo-hoe and lutefisk exists.)\n\nIf interested, a paper in Medical History journal (Volume 42, Issue 1, January 1998, pp 47-67) mentions the continuing issue (as of 1998)  of iodine deficiency in India, SE Asia, and China and the limited progress made on that since the discovery of iodine in treating goiter since 1832.)   [https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/S002572730006333X](https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/S002572730006333X)\n\nI think it was premature for anyone to conclude that the Romans introduced fish sauce to India or SE Asia. It is more likely the trade helped meet a booming demand. Roman garum also could have been particularly choice-tasting. because of the specific fish and amount of salt used.\n\n*Flor de Garum*, currently made from a recipe found in a Spanish monastery dated to the 3rd century C.E. (while the Roman empire actually still existed)  is said to be much more salty, pungent and fishy than even modern Asian fish sauces, with strong flavor of anchovies. (I haven't tasted it myself.)  If so, its sheer strength may have been an extra selling point: easy enough to water down to local tastes and resell for profit.","upvotes":22,"created_utc":1678005632.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678048058.0}]},{"title":"How have social conservatives defended the stigma against \u201cbastards,\u201d children born out of wedlock?","author":"Remote_Doughnut_5261","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11jh4fw\/how_have_social_conservatives_defended_the_stigma\/","text":"It seems like many cultures all over the world stigmatize bastards.

Ethnographer Jean Hurault estimated that there had been 30,000 people living in the area now known as French Guiana before the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th century. By the late 17th century, French colonial administrator Le Febvre de La Barre already noted that part of the \"Indians\" had disappeared. The two main ethnic groups living on the coast, the Galibi and the Palikour, went respectively from 5500 and 4000 people in 1604 to 2000 and 1200 in 1666 (rough estimates), and to 250 and 220 in the mid-1800s. In the interior, most of the 13 original ethnic groups identified by European observers disappeared in the 1700-1800s, though some were protected until the late 1800s by their isolation. By the late 1890, there were 1200 Wayana, 300 Wayapi and 100 Teko left (Hurault, 1965). Tracking native Guyanese groups across time and space is difficult due to the complex population movements and fusions that happened in the past centuries (Grenand and Grenand, 1979; Damien et al., 2012). The native populations were at their lowest in the mi-20th century, with about 2000 individuals, and picked up in the 1950-1970s once the French state took an actual interest in them. Today, there are about 8-10,000 people in 7 native groups: Wayana, Kali\u2019na (Galibi), Apala\u00ef, Teko (Emerillon), Wayampi (Way\u00e3pi, Oyampi), Pahikweneh (Palikour) et Lokono (Arawak) (Tiouka, 2016).\n\nBasically, contact with Europeans decimated the native populations of Guiana in a few decades. Most of this was caused by diseases: Hurault shows that population decreases happened every time a group was in relation with Europeans, traders or missionaries. The Jesuit missions of Kourou and Sinnamary, funded respectively in 1713 and 1740, closed down in 1760 due to epidemics. In 1817, 6000 Wayampi people fleeing the Portuguese moved to French Guiana: they were down to 200 in 1848. Diseases were also brutal to colonists: an attempt at mass colonisation in 1763 by 13-14,000 settlers brought from France ended abruptly in 1765, after two-thirds of the Europeans had died (Jolivet, 1982; Rothschild, 2009). This more or less killed any prospect of turning Guiana into a profitable colony like Saint-Domingue.\n\nGenerally, native populations were seen favourably by colonial and religious authorities, who saw them as harmless, amicable, and innocent \"savages\". Administrator Le Febvre de La Barre wrote in 1666: \n\n>They are lazy, and there is little service to be gained from them. Nevertheless, it is good to keep them as friends.\n\nThe condition of natives as free men was recognized as early as the 17th century, and French authorities did not meddle into native politics, unless they were asked to arbitrate intertribal disputes (Grenand and Grenand, 1979). Direct conflicts between French colonists and native populations were indeed rare, and religious missions (who otherwise did not oppose the enslavement of Africans) tended to protect the American natives from colonial exactions. In the 1620-1650s, the Galipi fought starving French settlers who were trying to steal food from them. In 1705, Governor de Ferolles started a war against Aroua people (who were refugees) in order to enslave them. This angered the Jesuits: they wrote about the situation to Naval Minister Pontchartain, who ordered Ferolles to free the enslaved Aroua, and then sacked him (Marchand-Th\u00e9bault, 1960).\n\n\n>On the account I gave to the King [Louis XIV], explaining to His Majesty that I could not believe that you were capable of having authorised the pretexts of bad faith and perfidy which were used, he ordered met to ask you give an exact account of what happened in this matter, and to tell you that he absolutely wants [...] that these Indians be sent home free, and that those who have sold them be forced to return the money, after you have taken the necessary precautions to make these Indians not feel the bad treatment they have received and to continue their trade with the colony as usual.\n\nPontchartrain reiterated these instructions to D'Orvilliers, Ferolles' successor. In the late 18th century, colonists on the coast tried to exploit the natives, and, again, authorities moved to protect them and attempted to lead them to \"civilisation\" (Hurault, 1965). \n\nOtherwise, native people was of little interest to colonial authorities, and their dwindling numbers made them mostly irrelevant except for scientists and explorers. Native populations, while not wanting to be assimilated, were interested in trading with the French, notably to acquire metal tools, which became a game-changer: they were able to build stronger boats able to withstand rapids, allowing them to travel faster and further than was possible with traditional bark canoes (Hurault, 1965), and they could clear up land more easily, which allowed them to establish villages on better soils, resulting in higher agricultural yields (Grenand and Grenand, 1979).\n\nAdministrators left native populations alone, occasionally trying to turn them into craftsmen or sedentary farmers, with little success, or worrying about their decline but doing little about it. This lack of interest can be partly explained by the fact that French Guiana was seen as a \"green hell\" much too dangerous for Europeans, who had mostly disappeared: a Guyanese Creole is an Afro-European descendant, not someone born locally, as in other overseas territories. French Guiana remained underdeveloped and poorly exploited. It became briefly valuable during the gold rush of the later half of the 19th century. Otherwise, its main use was as a penal colony where France sent convicts until 1938. \n\nThe status of native populations did not change much until the 1960s: they were living in France - and in a French department after 1946 - without being assimilated, let alone citizens, at at time when Guyanese Creoles like president of the French Senate Gaston Monnerville or singer and entertainer Henri Salvador were household names in France. Full political assimilation (\"francisation\") only arrived in 1964, and it was only in the early 1980s that a new generation of native, French-speaking Guyanese was able, for instance, to study abroad (Guyon, 2011).\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Fleury, Marie, Tasikale Alupki, Aimawale Opoya, and Waiso Alo\u00efk\u00e9. \u2018Les Wayana de Guyane fran\u00e7aise sur les traces de leur histoire\u2019.

We know, for instance, that one Athenian drachma was the daily wage for a rower in the fleet at the time of the Peloponnesian War and that one Roman denarius was a daily wage for a common soldier in the late republic, which gives us some idea that those coins were supposed to be enough to at least pay for one adult's daily needs, but it is difficult to get more specific than that. Our sources give us very little information about how much ordinary goods or services cost, and when they do, it is hard to know what to make of it.\n\nFor example, in *The Golden Ass* by Apuleius, the narrator Lucius goes to buy fish in the market for his dinner. The fishmonger offers fish for sale at 100 sestertii (25 denarii), but Lucius haggles him down to 20 denarii. Lucius' friend Pythias considers that price objectionably high, abuses the fishmonger, and throws out the fish. Lucius never gets his dinner. ([Apuleius, The Golden Ass 1.24](https:\/\/www.poetryintranslation.com\/PITBR\/Latin\/TheGoldenAssI.php#anchor_Toc346614956))\n\nWhat are we to make of this? That 20 denarii is too much for a fish dinner? Maybe, but on the other hand, Pythias is clearly a bit of a dolt, so perhaps we shouldn't take his word for it. *The Golden Ass* is a comedy, but what is the joke here? That Lucius got scammed, that Pythias is clueless, or just that Lucius went hungry? This is, in some sense, the ancient equivalent to \"It's one banana, what could it cost, ten dollars?\", but hearing the joke, and even *knowing* that it's a joke, doesn't really tell us what a banana (or a fish) *actually* costs.\n\nMost of our other evidence for ancient prices is similarly complicated. Are we getting an accurate account of what a product actually cost in the market, or did someone write this down entirely because it was so outrageously high or low? Even in the few cases where we have grounds to think we're getting a reasonably reliable indicator of price, we don't know how far we can generalize it. The ancient economy was not interconnected like the modern one, and prices in one particular place and time do not necessarily have any relation to prices elsewhere or in other times.\n\nThe closest we can come to a comprehensive sense of ancient prices is in the [Edict on Maximum Prices](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/23644199\/New_English_translation_of_the_Price_Edict_of_Diocletianus) issued by the Roman emperor Diocletian in 301 CE. The Edict was an attempt to stem rampant inflation by declaring maximum allowed prices for a wide range of goods and services, from mustard seeds to peacock feathers. At best, the edict reflects what one person in authority *thought* were reasonable prices, and it is useful from that perspective, but it appears to have been widely disregarded, no doubt in large part because it was not very realistic as compared with what was actually going on in contemporary markets.\n\n(On a side note, Egypt was fairly late to start minting coins, and when they did, they were minted on the same standard as Athenian coins. In fact, some of the earliest Egyptian coins were minted using coin dies brought from Athens. Since they were minted to pay mercenaries recruited from the Aegean, and Egypt had no native coin tradition of its own, they were made in values compatible with Greek coins.)\n\nSources:\n\nCurtis, James W. \u201cCoinage of Pharaonic Egypt.\u201d *Journal of Egyptian Archaeology* 43 (December, 1957): 71-76. \n\nHowgego, Christopher. *Ancient History from Coins.* London: Routledge, 1995.\n\nKatsari, Constantina. *The Roman Monetary System: The Eastern Provinces from the First to the Third Century AD*.

I started playing the new Like A Dragon game, set during that time period, and the intellectual history of Japanese Isolationism \/ Nativism is something I'm having trouble wrapping my head around. I understand (on a pretty basic \"read some Wikipedia articles\" level) the origin of the Sakoku Isolationist system, the growth of the Kokugaku school that championed native Japanese ideas, and the idea that most of the loyalists \"ishin shishi\" wanted to restore the emperor because the believed that the Shogun couldn't protect them from foreigners. At it's core, I'm still confused how a movement that won a civil war organizing under the slogan of \"Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\" could then, when in power, create a government modeled so strongly on foreign ideas-- and one that had far more contact with foreigners than the Shogunate had, either through trade or colonization. Wikipedia tells me that once in power the Meiji government used the slogan \"Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Armed Forces,\" but that seems a pretty far cry from the violently isolationist rallying cry it's supporters fought under. \n\nI know that a revolutionary ideology and the ruling ideology of a successful revolutionary government are rarely the same but I have some idea how the thinking evolved in say, the French or Russian Revolutions.

Part of their gimmick, for want of a better word, is that they do concept albums about wars. For example, their album Flowers From Exile is from the perspective of Republican exiles from the Spanish civil war (a conflict that I am much more familiar with). A subsequent album of theirs, A Passage to Rhodesia, is told from the perspective of Rhodesian soldiers. The album itself is ok. It has a few of Rome's best songs (especially One Fire and The Ballad of the Red Flame Lily), but most of it is pretty same-ish (Flowers From Exile and Masse Mensch Material are much better imo). Unfortunately, the album isn't available on Spotify, so I had to go to YouTube to listen to it. Against my better judgement, I took a look at the comment section, and I found it flooded by Rhodesia apologists. \n\nAll I knew about Rhodesia beforehand was that it resisted decolonization, and eventually declared independence from Britain to maintain white minority rule. The commenters almost universally claimed that it wasn't at all about racism, but about stopping communism. While I get that the USSR and China backed Zimbabwean freedom fighters, from a cursory glance this just seems like communists taking the opportunity to do well by doing good (basically, blackening the eye of geopolitical adversaries by supporting people fighting for their own freedom). \n\nOf course, apologists point to the subsequent regime of Mugabe (who I'm absolutely convinced did turn out to be a complete piece of shit) of why Rhodesia was in the right all along. However, this seems to me like an unfortunate accident of history (and an all too common example of bad replacing worse) than a valid reason to support a literal apartheid ethnostate.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?

TLDR: They are gaslighting racists, and here is why. The entire premise for colonisation was the belief in the so-called civilising mission. Colonial Zimbabwe, which was known as Southern Rhodesia until 1965 and Rhodesia thereafter until its independence in 1980, was founded in 1890 through the sponsorship of Cecil John Rhodes and his British South Africa Company (BSAC). Rhodes held the White-Man's Burden belief, which posits that it is the duty of the Anglo-Saxon race to help \"civilise\" the \"darker\" parts of the world, and viewed British imperialism as a positive force for this purpose. \n\nThe settlers who inhabited colonial Zimbabwe shared this worldview and treated the indigenous African population as if they were children in need of guidance, protection, and civilization. As a result, the policies implemented by the settler state in areas such as politics, constitution-making, governance, education, economy, land and labour policies, social relations, and residential policy were grounded in this sense of racial superiority and the determination to promote white interests at the expense of the non-white population. Racial segregation was a fundamental element of the entire colonial project at every level.  \n\n\n The settlers in colonial Zimbabwe perceived themselves as bringers of peace and deeply moral individuals, distinct from the \"less-than-human\"  black population, which they associated with brute nature (*there is no such thing as a spirit in the stone! Misrepresentations of Zimbabwean Stone Sculpture: An Anthropological Approach*). Consequently, the white population generally considered Africans as perpetual children who required firm and stringent control by civilised settlers. As a result, Africans were continually infantilized and frequently referred to as \"boys\" or \"girls,\" irrespective of their age, as evidenced by the common references to \"houseboys\" and  \"housegirls\" for grown African men and women.  Africans in Rhodesia faced petty discrimination laws that prohibited  them from using facilities reserved for Whites only, such as toilets,  park benches, and other public amenities. \n\nFurthermore, Africans were politically marginalised despite the vote being technically open to all who met the various qualifications. However, the qualifications were set so high that very few Africans could meet them, resulting in the majority of the African population being unable to vote. For instance, the 1923 Constitution granted the vote to all men (white women had been allowed to vote in  1919) who were British subjects over 21 years of age and literate enough to fill out the application form, but with the condition that to be eligible, applicants for enrolment must have an income of \u00a3100 per annum, occupy buildings worth \u00a3150, or own a mining claim. Since the average wage of an African was \u00a33 a month, only whites were eligible to vote under this constitution.  In 1951, Huggins increased the monetary requirement from an annual income of \u00a3100 or property worth \u00a3150, which had been set in 1914, to  \u00a3240 and \u00a3500, respectively. However, by the late 1950s, many black people were able to meet this standard, and it was noted that increasing the threshold would soon begin to affect white voters. Some of the numerous laws that were passed in Rhodesia   \n\n\n1.  **Land Apportionment Act, 1930**  \n*The law was designed to provide a legal framework for the segregation of land along racial lines. The act divided land in Southern Rhodesia into three categories: Native reserves, European land, and crown land. Native reserves were set aside for the African population, while European land was reserved for the white minority. Crown land was designated for government use and was not available for settlement. The act also introduced the concept of \"tribal trust lands,\" which were intended to be held in trust for the benefit of African communities. However, the reality was that these lands were of poor quality and were not suitable for farming or human habitation. The reserves were deliberately established in areas that were not suitable for farming to prevent white farmers from facing significant competition.* \n2.  **The Native Land Husbandry Act of 1951**  \n *This law was designed to promote the \"betterment\" and modernisation of  African agriculture by increasing \"efficiency and productivity.\" In effect, the law aimed to replace communal land ownership with private ownership among natives. Families were allocated 8 acres of land, which could not be subdivided among their children, conflicting with traditional beliefs. The District Commissioners were given the power to distribute land instead of the chiefs. The act also introduced compulsory conservation methods and limited the number of cattle owned by African families. Africans who failed to secure land in the reserves had to work for Europeans in mines and factories and were forced to work in public projects. Failure to comply with the Act was punishable by fine or imprisonment.* \n3.  **The Sale of Liquor to Natives and Indians Regulations of 1898** \n4.  **Immorality and Indecency Suppression Act 1903**                                                             *This law* *criminalized sexual acts between a \"native male\" and a \"female European\"  This provision reflects the deeply racist and sexist attitudes of the time, which viewed African men as a threat to white  European women and perpetuated the notion of European superiority over  Africans.* \n5.  The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia at the time, Godfrey Huggins,  strongly opposed the appointment of black people to any governmental position and the **Public Services Act of 1921** prohibited indigenous peoples from working in the civil service. \n6. The legislation in Southern Rhodesia at the time granted white employers unchallenged authority over their black workers. This enabled white workers to resist black opposition, and as a result, pressure from white trade unions led to policies that restricted the employment of black people to positions below a certain skill level. Additionally, the **Industrial Conciliation Act of 1934** barred black people from participating in trade unions.\n\nThis is not exhaustive but I hope it helps take a look into some of the causes that led to the war and the animosity that followed.","upvotes":105,"created_utc":1677963723.0},{"author":"furbius","text":"A little more insight into the mindset of of Rhodesia apologists who propose that the fight for Rhodesia was not about racism but about stopping communism.\n\nAs many have pointed out, Rhodesia was a country of institutionalized racism. Rhodesia apologists tend to be those who enthusiastically supported the ruling white regime.  Most ex-Rhodesians fall into this camp given the fact that as late as the general election of 1977, 95% of the white populace voted for The Rhodesian Front or the Rhodesian Action Party, both of which espoused white supremacist views.  Since racism in the wider world is deeply unacceptable, the apologists now seek to minimize the racism of the Ian Smith regime and thereby diminish their guilt in abetting this regime.   \n\nUnfortunately, in proposing that the struggle in Rhodesia was \"A fight against communism\", the apologist are simply confirming their ignorance and racism. Many truly believe this since it was the prevailing narrative of the Rhodesia Herald back in the 1970s.  The Rhodesia Herald was the countries largest English language daily paper, it was subject to government censorship for much of Ian Smith's tenure and was generally regarded as the propaganda arm of the Rhodesian Front.  This paper never acknowledged the political aspirations of the black majority and the apologists perpetuate this willful ignorance, having no regard for the origins and legitimacy of African Nationalism in Zimbabwe.  The modern movement can be traced back to 1948, Benjamin Burombo and the African trade unions. This year marks the birth of organized African political opposition to the ruling white regimes.  This  political activism continued to grow, morphing into true political parties and activities that challenged the ruling white elite.   The Smith regime responded by outlawing African political parties and jailing their leaders.  The biographies of the pre-Independance nationalists reveal that all were fighting against the indignities of being 2nd class citizens in their own country.  Apart from this determination to have equal rights and a say in their governance, there is no clear consensus among this group as to the preferred socioeconomic order.

Voltaire, in contrast, was looking at Chinggis Khan not just through the lens of  stereotypes about \"oriental despots\", but also as a paragon of absolutist monarchy (which to him and other *philosophes* was a bad thing).

He died in 1274 and wrote prolifically.  His *Summa Theologica* looks like an encyclopedia on a book shelf and covers an impressive, dare I say 'Renaissance Man' diversity of subjects.  The Cliff's Notes description of his life's work is that he integrated good clear analytical thinking, the philosophical best practices inherited from pre-Christian Greek philosophers, and the nascent sciences with Catholic theology.\n\nThe structure of the Summa is generally to begin with a question.  He then gives a few or 4 or 5 right and wrong answers based on conventional wisdom or Greek philosophers or prominent historical Church figures, then he gives his own answer that integrates all of these or explains why\/how previous answers were were maybe intuitive but wrong\/incomplete.  He often does the opposite of 'straw man' arguments.  I've heard them called 'iron man' arguments.  He asks his question, then proposes a popular but wrong answer, then develops it as thoroughly as he can to give it a respectful airing, THEN he knocks it down.  It is dense, challenging, rewarding reading imho.\n\nGetting to the OP's question of animals having souls - Part 1 of the *Summa Theologica*, [Question 78](https:\/\/www.newadvent.org\/summa\/1078.htm), he addresses how souls work (in their opinion, given what could be known in the 1200s, which is more sophisticated than I expected.)\n\nTo summarize, everything alive has a soul.  People, animals, plants all have a soul while they live.  However, there are 3 categories.  You can have a vegetative soul, a sensitive soul, or a rational soul.  Lower life forms that can eat\/grow\/reproduce are at the vegetative level.  The acorn that goes about its business of becoming a tree in the presence of soil\/water\/light is animated by its vegetative soul.  Modern readers would put microbes in this class as well.  Vegetative does not equal \"plants\" exactly, just lower level biological activity.\n\nMoving up one level, a puppy dog can do 'vegetative' things (like growing hair, digesting food) plus be able to feel hunger, pain, amorousness, happiness, etc.  They have 'senses' and a sensitive soul, says Aquinas.\n\nUp one more level, and the rational soul is possessed by humans, only.  We do all the vegetative and sensitive things, plus we can reason and choose good vs. evil.  A puppy dog can be hungry, then think through how to go about getting some food (so some level of mental faculties are present in a living thing with a sensitive soul), then over-eat, but he cannot commit the sin of gluttony, to illustrate where they drew the line (in the 1200s!)\n\nA vegetative or sensitive soul no longer exists after the plant\/animal dies, but a rational soul has continued existence in the Hereafter, says Aquinas.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678062965.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1677950133.0}]},{"title":"Jaguars were once native to what is now the United States.

Your guess at Yiddish slang in pop culture is a solid one, but I think it's fair to say that Yiddish incorporation into popular culture developed *alongside* the social forces of assimilation and widening of the Jewish-American experience that pushed more Yiddish vernacular into English, rather than one directly causing the other. A lot of my sourcing for my answer comes from Sol Steinmetz's 1986 *Yiddish & English: The Story of Yiddish in America*, which charts this linguistic history.\n\nThe first avenue of Yiddish in America\/American English comes in New York City in the late 19th and early 20th century. This is when massive waves of Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from central and eastern Europe came through Ellis Island and predominantly settled in New York, primarily in the tenements of the Lower East Side. (To learn more about this history today, the [Tenement Museum](https:\/\/www.tenement.org\/) is a fantastic space of preservation, and its website has some digital exhibitions for those unable to make it to New York.) These immigrants were Yiddish speakers, and often exclusively Yiddish speakers; many hadn't received a formal or secular education back in their European Jewish communities back home. The first generation of migrants spoke Yiddish in the home, with many encouraging their children and grandchildren to receive a secular education, rely on English rather than Yiddish, and assimilate into American anglo society. Despite this assimilatory pressure, Yiddish was still a powerful part of American Jewish vernacular, and because of the tight knit communities in New York it became an element of gentile vernacular as well. Steinmetz quotes H.L. Mencken from 1936:\n\n> In New York City the high density of Eastern Jews in the population has made almost every New Yorker familiar with a long list of Yiddish words, e.g. *kosher, shadchan, matzoth, mazuma, yom kippur, meshuggah, gefilte-fisch,* and many non-Jewish New Yorkers have added others that are not generally familiar, e.g. *schul, bar-mitzva, blintzes, kaddish, treyfa, dayyan, goy, dokus, shochet, schmus, shicker, schiksa, mohel, get, hesped, kishkes, kittl, meshummad,* and *pesach*. The Yiddish exclamation of *oi-yoi* is common New Yorkese, and Yiddish greetings, *mazzaltov* and *scholom aleichim,* are pretty well known and understood.\n\nOf course, this was not restricted to New York. In 1920, Leah Rachel Yoffie charted the growth of Yiddish in St. Louis and how Yiddish proverbs were still retained by the non-Yiddish speaking children of Jewish immigrants. *Abie the Agent* was a comic strip from Jewish cartoonist Harry Hershfeld that featured a Jewish car salesman featuring ample Yiddishisms; it debuted at the New York Journal in 1914 and was eventually syndicated nationwide through a Hearst subsidiary. Singers like Sophie Tucker brought Yiddish influenced jazz entertainment nationwide and to non-Jewish audiences as well, with \"My Yiddishe Mama\" a bastion of the 1920s. The Andrews Sisters, a non-Jewish singing group, made a dent in 1937 with their recording of the reworked Yiddish song [\"Bei Mir Bist Du Sch\u00f6n (Means That You're Grand).\"](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EGveTSQbH30) Within the year TONS of artists put out recordings of the song, including luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nThat's not what Steinmetz situates as the thrust for Yiddish making it into non-Jewish milieus, though. While acknowledging that a full account of Yiddish incorporation into American English is \"rather poor,\" he notes that Yiddishisms had been seeping into English throughout the decades of the early twentieth century. The flashpoint for mass incorporation (and therefore, spreading to non-Jewish areas as per your question), in his view, is the Second World War, for two reasons: the influx of Yiddish-speaking Holocaust post-war, and the interaction between Jewish and non-Jewish soldiers in American military units bringing sectors of the country together for the first time. He writes:\n\n> The oral use of these words was not recorded during the war, but it can be taken for granted that the earliest printed dates were preceded by at least several years of oral use among bilingual Jews of the second generation and their Gentile friends. The earliest recorded dates of the following common slang words illustrate the trend: nebbish [properly nebish] 'in- effectual or unfortunate person, sad sack' (1941, in Bud Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run?, also the short form neb ), shnoz 'nose' (1942, probably a blend of shnuk 'snout' and noz 'nose'), shmendrik 'insignificant person, nobody' (1944), chutzpah [properly khutspe] 'impertinence, gall' (1945), shmo 'simpleton, nitwit' (1947), shlemazl 'unlucky person' (1948), shnuk 'dope, fool' (1949), shlump 'sloppy person' (1952), mentsh 'decent person' (1953), megillah [preferably megile] 'long story' (1957), yente 'gossipy woman' (1957).\n\nSo a tl;dr answer: Jewish pop culture had been an increasingly large part of the canon throughout the early 20th century, and Yiddish vernacular survived the Americanization of Jewish first- and second-generation migrants, but the true moments of nationwide spreading came around the 30s and 40s...or right before your mother's birth. It's how the non-Jewish Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams could sing \"schlemiel, schlimazl, hassenpfeffer incorporated\" in the 1970s at the start of every *Laverne and Shirley* episode, have it set in not-all-that-Jewish Milwaukee, and not bat many eyes. The language diffusion had largely already taken place by then due to the gradual integration of Jewish individuals into broader secular American communities.","upvotes":185,"created_utc":1677937386.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":59,"created_utc":1677874271.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":48,"created_utc":1677881038.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677882791.0}]},{"title":"What happened post Civil Rights Movement to all the businesses that not only refused Black patronage but were violent toward Black customers?","author":"J2quared","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11ikdt6\/what_happened_post_civil_rights_movement_to_all\/","text":"Specifically around the 1970s and early 80s?","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677981784.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Suetonius (*Life of Nero* 29) goes into more sexual detail and claims that he emperor used to imitate the cries of a maiden when having sex. Dio mostly repeats the claims of Suetonius, though using the name Pythagoras, according to the epitome of the 62:nd book of his Roman History. Otherwise the evidence for how frequent he was believed to take the submissive role is a little difficult to ascertain, as one word commonly used about his lovers is *exoletus*, which has a somewhat unclear meaning and can possibly be used of males taking both 'roles'.\n\nOne can note however that his marriage to Sporus (who was castrated like some other *pueri delicati* and was afterwards feminine-presenting), is better attested in the sources, as it is mentioned by not only Suetonius and Cassius Dio (who, though later, appears to have some unique material on this topic), but also the earlier writers Plutarch and Dio Chrysostom, who were both alive in the reign of Nero. But even this is not a guarantee for historical accuracy as both of these wrote during the Flavian period, when negative claims about Nero would have been used to bolster the current dynasty's legitimacy.\n\nWhen it comes to the sex lives of emperors, it is in most cases very difficult to distinguish truth from rumours and propaganda, especially when our sources are highly negative (this can be compared with the Suetonian claims about Tiberius' paedophilia, but perhaps contrasted with Domitian's lover Earinus for whom there is contemporary evidence of from Valerius Martial and Statius).","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1678056421.0}]},{"title":"Who were the cagots, where did they go, and why were they discriminated?","author":"Lexaconn7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11i67v0\/who_were_the_cagots_where_did_they_go_and_why\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677949316.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

There are three main issue, first our knowledge of archaeology itself is really nonexistent and fragmented, second, because of that we can't really see what we have and haven't excavated beyond regional groups, and third, what we do have is usually opportunistic or reactive.  \n\nThe first issue is that we have no collective knowledge of archaeology it's broken into a million pieces because of the fragmentary state of our discipline.  I'm talking about the data and knowledge we produce, not the archaeological record which is fragmentary to begin with.  Archaeology and archaeological data is divided up amongst thousands of databases, data silos, universities, governmental departments at the regional and national levels,  commercial and private excavation companies, volunteer societies and organizations, museums, archives, libraries, and so many more institutions.  \n\nBecause of that, the second issue is that we don't have the capability to look at archaeology broadly and answer questions like this.  The next part is that all of those different groups have different standards, different definitions, terminologies, and more so simply trying to access data from another group is a nightmare.  I recently tried to do some basic benchmarking in the UK to figure out how many sites or projects certain groups have stored in their databases.  I got no where because we got into a discussion about the definition of a site and the database managers (all archaeologists) couldn't get past that issue and give any sort of rough estimate of places that had been excavated that were stored in their database. \n\nThe third issue then gets back to my main point, archaeology is reactionary.  Most of our work either relies on something already being noticeable or assumed knowledge suggests it's there or it relies on reaction to development.  The first thing is obvious, a lot of more academic archaeology relies on pre-existing knowledge or the obvious.  People get excited about how Schliemann found Troy or Mycenae but it isn't some amazing feat, the Lion Gate of Mycenae was literally sticking out of the ground in a place that has been named the same thing, amongst cities that have maintained the same name that also had very obvious archaeology sticking out of the ground. \n\nThat's still a lot of modern archaeology but now we slap some statistical models on it, do some survey work, and say that we used GIS techniques to estimate potential sites.  99% of those articles I think are disingenuous and frustrating and will usually include some ethnographic or anthropological aspect where they say \"so and so from this town said there's a ruin over there\" and that was the entirety of the process but they need to make it look good for funders or for their research purposes so they'll slap all the bells and whistles on it.  It's disappointing and frustrating because it means we're still taking the easy path.  It also means we're still excavating the obvious and the central areas of groups and civilizations.  There are few efforts to branch out to look at rural areas that aren't easy to access and easy to excavate.  Part of this is simply because we don't have the technology to do anything on that scale yet. \n\nThe final part of this is that an estimated 86% of archaeology is conducted by commercial, salvage, preventative, CRM, or rescue groups, i.e., the groups that excavate before development or construction.  Again, this is more reactive than proactive so we only get what we stumble upon if someone is building something.  That means large parts of it are still centered on areas we already know archaeology exists, in city and town centers usually.  There are larger scale projects like rail and highway that are giving us an opportunity to find more outside of those areas but, again, that data and knowledge is often fragmented and lost to the bigger picture. \n\nThere's also the issue that we simply don't know what was lost or destroyed over the decades and centuries before archaeology became a legal requirement (albeit in a very very very very limited capacity) before construction.  \n\nTo sum up, it's probable that there are states, cultures, civilizations that we've missed or we've grouped into other categorizations because we simply don't have the widespread knowledge of our own field and the proactive practices to understand what we are and aren't seeing.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1678006142.0}]},{"title":"Why aren't the months of the year lined up with with the equinox\/solstices, the astrological signs, or anything else pertaining to astronomy?","author":"pseuzy17","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11irf6a\/why_arent_the_months_of_the_year_lined_up_with\/","text":"Why is January 1st 11 days after the winter solstice?

But my understanding (which may be wrong!) is that ideas about Noahide laws and a Noahide covenant with God didn't come into existence until much later - like Talmud era.\n\nSo we've got kind of an awkward period of about 400 BCE to about 200 CE (to maybe up to 600 CE) where I am not totally sure about Jewish views of pagans. Obviously, I know that Jews didn't want pagans to impose their gods on the Jews, and didn't want Jews worshiping pagan gods - but what did Jews think of foreign pagans (not living in Judah\/Judea) worshiping their own gods in this period? Do we have any information about it? Were \"good\" pagans supposed to acknowledge Yahweh as either supreme god\/the only god?","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1677989743.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth with simple geometry and deduction.\n\nIt sounds like you were shown things that might have been better done after the concept was solved.  (Mind you, clay is endlessly malleable, so...)   Maxwell was distinctive.\n\nGesture is very strongly correlated with visuospatial thinking. That's the oldest thing of all.\n\nIn fact, papers have been published studying its effect on spatial problem solving.  It's better than just \"thinking it out.\"  People vary very much in how good they are at visuospatial thinking, but gesture really helps develop and process and make the \"abstract tangible\" as you say.\n\nAlso, body parts could be used as primitive rulers as well as for counting (see the Venerable Bede's hand counting system, and the origin of \"hand,\" \"finger\" and \"foot\" as measures in English.)\n\nPeople used compasses, protractors, and such for 2-D geometry and technical drawing; a line and plumb were used for centuries if not millennia before spirit levels.  People built buildings based on 2-D sketches or just basic spatial reasoning with tools and measures on a regular basis.\n\nProps also helped-- astrolabes were popular with astronomers to help them predict stars' rising and setting and sunrise.  Between using the two, you could essentially simulate a computer model, just in an analog manner, not digital.\n\nWhat I think Maxwell (who lived in the middle of 19th century) could have done while gesturing the rough shape of this curve is to use three grids at right angles.  For instance, think two walls and a floor of a cardboard box; they're all gridded out.  That would give him the visual coordinates to gesture his calculations against. Then he could use the same thing (maybe a smaller scale) to sculpt straight into clay.\n\nIf he wanted to say, test the sculpture was correctly done, he could have used pinpoints in the box walls, put it all in a dark room, and shine one side of  a boxed lantern on the grid, and be sure the clay reflected right where the points should be.  (he'd know his optics here.  In fact, he used sunshine on a plaster model later to draw different curves, so I suspect he might have used light in making the clay model. He  then converted these plaster lines in a 2-D drawing)\n\nHe would probably only care about a few major points on the curve, because if he knew what a specific curve should be, he could easily correct it as long as he knew where it began, ended, and the high\/low points.  He wouldn't need a zillion points, just maybe a few dozen, tops.\n\nThink of a \"connect the dots\" doodle game, only he had protractors and such and he decided where the dots should be to mark the curves he already worked out in gesture. If he had a wrong point on the clay sculpture, he could push pins in the clay to mark what needed fixing, and adjust the clay, and smooth it out at the same time.\n\nOf course, we're talking human senses, not computer-like accuracy.  He wanted to demonstrate what the curve WAS, not have it absolutely precise, just smooth.\n\nNo sticks needed (maybe pushpins.  Just his eyeballs, his reasoning, experience, tools, and some props to enhance accuracy.\n\nThis is a 19th century example, of course.   For classical Greece, Archimedes yelling eureka in his tub and figuring out to figure out complex volumes just using water displacement is a classic story, of course.\n\nEven stone-age mathematicians would have had string, sticks, shadows, stones to work with, as well as woven goods, and yes, always mud, sand, or clay, or containers with water.","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1678013959.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677961254.0}]},{"title":"20th century film & TV often used Warsaw Pact weapons (AK47\/AKM, SVD, Tokarev) as a visual shorthand for \"bad guy\".

However, eventually some Greek poleis started implementing a unified shield blazon in battle as he has explained [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/p5g97c\/shields_with_a_%CE%BB\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/4jlv6b\/did_the_spartans_have_lambdas_on_their_shields\/)","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1677965623.0},{"author":"Pami_the_Younger","text":"Yes, though not all poleis did, and only in certain mediums: as u\/Iphikrates shows in the linked answers, civic military symbols (e.g. banners, shield blazons, coats of arms) were generally not a feature of the Greek world.\n\nInstead, the medium on which symbols were expressed and disseminated across the Greek world - and the ability for these symbols to spread was crucial to their function \u2013 was everyone\u2019s favourite lovely and shiny medium: coins. We have to consider what the purpose of a civic symbol was \u2013 at its heart, these symbols have a twofold purpose: to unite the in-group, and impress the out-group. It needs, therefore, to ideally consist of something all citizens will support, and be prominent and recognisable to others. If we consider, for example, the United Kingdom\u2019s flag: its combination of the different flags of the united countries expresses and encourages the union of the citizens; its bold colours stand out and are immediately recognisable to citizens of other countries. And as a means of spreading these symbols you could hardly come up with a better medium than coins: everyone needs them, and owing to the general absence of closed monetary economies in the ancient Mediterranean (the Ptolemaic kingdom being a significant exception) they could spread pretty freely around the world and be accepted everywhere, as long as you were known well enough to guarantee their precious metal content.\n\nThe most famous civic symbol amongst the ancient Greeks is almost certainly the Athenian owl. One of the most common ancient coins is the Athenian silver tetradrachm, with Athene\u2019s head in profile on the obverse, and an owl on the reverse (e.g. [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetradrachm#\/media\/File:Complete\\_strike\\_of\\_Athenian\\_tetradrachm..jpg](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetradrachm#\/media\/File:Complete_strike_of_Athenian_tetradrachm..jpg)); the combination of obverse profile\/reverse civic symbol is so potent that it is still the default for many coins today. The design incorporates the two purposes I spoke of earlier: Athene, as eponymous god of Athens, is a great unifier for the city; the owl is immediately recognisable and entirely distinctive of Athens. It is clearly an Athenian coin, and no-one looking at it would mistake it for anything else, because it looks exactly like an Athenian coin should. Athens also had a huge population, which helped it both become a huge commercial hub, spreading its coins around the Mediterranean, and also forced many citizens to seek out mercenary work. And since they preferred to be paid in coins they recognised, other countries around the Mediterranean, even ones without any numismatic tradition, began to mint coins in the Athenian model as well; we find examples of \u2018Athenian\u2019 tetradrachms minted in Egypt, for example, used to pay the many Greek mercenaries the Egyptian kings hired, because the Athenian standard was widely recognised and accepted.\n\nOther cities, and later the leagues and kings, also had their own symbols; Boeotian coins (e.g. this Theban tetradrachm [https:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/boeotia\/thebes\/sg2400.jpg](https:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/boeotia\/thebes\/sg2400.jpg)) often had a shield on the obverse; Corinthian coins (e.g. this stater [https:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/corinth\/BMC\\_244.jpg](https:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/corinth\/BMC_244.jpg)) frequently had Pegasus and the letter *qoppa*, which died out of the *koine* Greek alphabet but was used originally to spell Corinth (\u03d8\u1f79\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2). The leagues also adopted symbols: the Aetolian League, for example, often used the figure of Aetolus, the mythological hero who gave the region its name, equipped in typical Aetolian dress (e.g. this tetradrachm [http:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/aitolia\/BMC\\_04ff.jpg](http:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/aitolia\/BMC_04ff.jpg)). And the Hellenistic kings also adopted symbols for their kingdoms (their profiles, obviously, occupied the obverse): Agathocles, king of Sicily, minted this coin with the famous triskelion on the reverse ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flag\\_of\\_Sicily#\/media\/File:001-syracuse-Triskeles.jpg](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flag_of_Sicily#\/media\/File:001-syracuse-Triskeles.jpg)); the Ptolemies frequently used the eagle (e.g. [https:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/egypt\/ptolemy\\_II\/Svoronos\\_354var.jpg](https:\/\/www.wildwinds.com\/coins\/greece\/egypt\/ptolemy_II\/Svoronos_354var.jpg)) as symbol of Zeus and kingship.\n\nSome of these symbols persisted, some didn\u2019t: many people today would still recognise the Athenian owl and the Sicilian triskelion and associate them with those people; few would recognise Aetolus, or understand that Pegasus (through Bellerophon) was linked to Corinth. But they were potent symbols in their own time, recognisable to Greeks and non-Greeks around the world; markers of a city\u2019s, league\u2019s, or king\u2019s divine support, and their own power and wealth; like modern flags, a visible and potent symbol of civic identity.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1678139796.0}]},{"title":"The Industrial Revolution is typically said to have begun in the 1700s, around 1750.

This a short citation (following Guillaume's 1967 translation (p. 26-27)) of the specific event: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>'Abdul Mutallib then let go of the knocker of the door of the Ka'ba and went off with his Quraysh companions to the montain tops where they took up edfesnive positions waiting to see what Abraha would do when he occupied Mecca. In the morning Abraha prepared to enter the town and made his elephant ready for battle and drew up his troops. His intention was to destroy the temple and then return to the Yaman. When they made the elephant (its name was Mahmud) face Mecca, Nufayl b. Habbib came up to its flank and taking hold of its ear said: 'Kneel, Mahmud, or go straight back whence you came, for you are in God's holy land'. He let go of its ear and the elephant knelt, and Nufayl made off at top speed for the top of the mountain. The troops beat the elephant to make it get up but it would not; they beat its head with iron bars; they stuck hooks into its underbelly and scarified it; but it would not get up. Then they made it face the Yaman and immediately it got up and started off. When they set it towards the north and the east it did likewise, but as soon as they directed it towards Mecca it knelt down'.  \n>  \n>Then God sent upon them birds from the sea like swallows and starlings; each bird carried three stones like peas and lentils, one in its beak and two between its claws. Everyone who was hit died but not all were hit. They withdrew in flight by the way they came, crying out for Nufayl b. Habib to guide them on the way to the Yaman.   \n>  \n>\\[poetry\\]  \n>  \n>As they withdrew they were continually falling by the wayside dying miserably by every waterhole. Abraha was smitten in his body, and as they took him away his fingers fell off one by one.   \n>  \n>\\[...\\]   \n>  \n>When God sent Muhammad he specifically recounted to the Quraysh his goodness and favour in turning back the Abyssinians in order to preserve their state and permanence: 'Did you not see how your Lord dealt with the owners of the elephant? Did he not reduce their guile to sheer terror? And sent upon them flocks of birds , throwing hard clay stones upon them, making them as blades of corn that have been devoured.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, let's pick this narrative apart.\n\n**1.** **Abraha**\n\nThe Abraha referred to in the *s\u012bra* was an Ethiopian ruler who took control over South Arabia sometime around 530 AD. In the preceding decades, South Arabia, then ruled by the Himyarites, had seen a struggle over political dominance between a pro-independence and a pro-Ethiopian faction. Although the sources are not entirely unambiguous, it seems that the pro-Ethiopian faction was able to install one of their own \u2013   Ma\u02bfd\u012bkarib Ya\u02bffur  \u2013 over the kingdom around 510 AD. His rule was ended by a pro-independence rebellion led by  Y\u016bsuf \u02beAs\u02bfar Ya\u1e6f\u02bfar, better known in the Islamic tradition as Y\u016bsuf \u1e0f\u016b Nuw\u0101s, dated to between 522 and 524 AD.\n\nY\u016bsuf's rebellion led to an Ethiopian military intervention, ending Himyarite rule and turning the region into a direct Ethiopian suzerain. The Ethiopians originally seemed to have placed a Christian ally of theirs on the Himyarite throne, but he was overthrown by the aforementioned Abraha. From what we know, Abraha attempted to establish himself as an independent ruler in South Arabia and adopted many of the stylings and political traditions established by the Himyarites in the centuries before. \n\nOne of the traditions that Abraha adopted was the organization of regular raids into Central Arabia. After the Himyarites had established political dominance over South Arabia in the 4th century AD, they sought to expand their influence over the Central Arabian oasis towns. Abraha, probably seeking to establish himself as a legitimate Himyarite ruler, followed in their footsteps. In one of the last dated South Arabian inscriptions attested, around 552 AD, Abraha mentions his exploits (Muraygh\u0101n 3, translation following [DASI](http:\/\/dasi.cnr.it\/index.php?id=30&prjId=1&corId=0&colId=0&navId=126302817&recId=8670&mark=08670%2C001%2C002)):  \n\n>1\u00a0\u00a0The king \u02bebrh Zybmn, king of Saba\u02be, \u1e0fu-Rayd\u0101n, \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt, Ymnt,   \n2\u00a0\u00a0of their Arabs of \u1e6cwdm and Thmt, wrote this inscription when he came back from the country of M\u02bfdm,   \n3\u00a0\u00a0when he took possession of the Arabs of M\u02bfdm, from M\u1e0frn, he drove out \u02bfmrm, son of M\u1e0frn, and he   \n4\u00a0\u00a0took possession of all the Arabs of M\u02bfdm, Hgrm, \u1e2a\u1e6d, \u1e6cym, Y\u1e6frb and Gzm.  \n\nAlthough the South Arabian script is unvocalized, we do recognize many of the place names mentioned here. M\u02bfdm most likely refers to the pre-Islamic tribal coalition of Ma\u02bfdd; Hgrm and \u1e2a\u1e6d are two territories in East Arabia, whereas Gzm *probably* refers to the North Arabian tribe of Judh\u0101m. Most fascinatingly for us, however, is the mentioning of Y\u1e6frb, which is certainly the pre-Islamic name of Medina, i.e., Yathrib. \n\nSo the Islamic-period narrative likely reflects the historical retention of an Ethiopian ruler taking control over South Arabia and seeking to expand his influence through military aims over Central Arabia. There is even some rock art from South Arabia that seems to portray elephants, possibly made by someone who saw them in a military context. \n\nBut that raises the question: where is Mecca in all of this? \n\n**2. Pre-Islamic Mecca as a holy site**\n\nAlthough the existence of pre-Islamic Mecca is not really in doubt amongst most serious historians, it is rather annoying that there is no pre-Islamic documentary evidence referring to the city. A few years ago, Ian Morris wrote a [fantastic article](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiJ_aXB9MH9AhU7GFkFHYjDBrcQFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmedievalists.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2FUW-26-Morris.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2cveuiabqU6cvbl7gb_fVk) going through the traditional arguments in favor of identifying Claudius Ptolemy's Macoraba with Mecca and showed, I think convicingly, that they don't really hold water.\n\nNow, while it is not impossible that Abraha attempted to and possibly even did conquer Mecca, the fact that it is apparently not mentioned in any of his inscriptions gives the impression that Mecca may simply not have been as important as later Islamic narratives make it out to be. It is likely that the narrative seen here probably sought to establish pre-Islamic Mecca as Arabia's holy site *per excellence* by combining a historical event with a Quranic narrative: \n\nNamely, the final part that I blatantly copied from Guillaume's translation is actually a Quranic *s\u016bra*, appropriately titled *s\u016brah al-f\u012bl*, 'the chapter of the Elephant'. The narrative also introduces Abdul Mutallib, better known as Muhammad's grandfather and describes him as Mecca's primary envoy to the Ethiopians, thus bestowing Muhammad's family with an additional honor. The fact that the elephant refuses to enter Mecca from any direction *further* solidifies pre-Islamic Mecca as Arabia's *holiest of holies.* And to top it off, in the same year that God saved Mecca from destruction, the Prophet was born. \n\nThe fact that the Islamic tradition is not primarily concerned with providing an 'accurate' historical narrative is clear from several discrepancies. There is no evidence that Abraha died during one of the expeditions to Central Arabia, as the aforementioned inscription indicates. He may not even have participated in person. Taking the inscriptions and Ibn Ishaq's narrative at face value and trying to fit them together also pushes back Muhammad's birth by about twenty years. \n\nBut in my opinion the more interesting thing is that early Muslim scholars actively adapted historical events and re-interpreted them to provide them with teleological and sacred meanings.","upvotes":93,"created_utc":1677921406.0}]},{"title":"Did British upper-classes dance at dinner parties?","author":"Ovid738","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11hw44x\/did_british_upperclasses_dance_at_dinner_parties\/","text":"I recently watched \u2018The Leopard\u2019 starring Burt Lancaster, and the climax is a lavish dinner party where people danced in the mansion\u2019s ballroom afterwards. \n\nWas dancing a part of British aristocratic dinner parties?

However, that raises the question: either way, why was there a collapse of an urbanised society in the Mississippi Valley, but not in other parts of the world, including many regions where the land had been intensively cultivated for thousands of years?\n\nThe most likely reason is that farming depended on crops that were still relatively new to the region. Maize, the main staple crop, was introduced to the region around 500-1000 AD. By comparison, wheat and barley were present in the vast majority of Europe by 2800 BC. Because maize and other key crops were still relatively new to the Mississippi Valley, the farming had not had much time to adapt to the local climate and become more resilient. Either a change in the climate or overexploitation could have been enough to cause a disastrous drop in the food supply, making it impossible to sustain the food surplus that supported the urbanised society.\n\nTo understand my point: suppose a society is 5% urbanised, which is high for a pre-modern society, and similar to France in the 18th century. That means that at least 5% of the population need feeding but do not contribute to the food supply themselves. Now suppose that the yearly food supply drops by 5% and does not recover. The rural population will by default want to feed themselves first and only sell surplus food. Thus that 5% drop alone could be disastrous for the urban population, unless they are very good at coercing it out of the rural population.\n\n**The importance of farming**\n\nFarming is the foundation for allowing societies to become urbanised. Although some hunter-gatherer societies had sedentary lifestyles instead of nomadic or seasonally sedentary ones, none has been able to obtain the kind of population density that could permit urbanisation. So the transition from hunter-gather to farming societies had to happen first.\n\nFor farming to take root, far more important than soil fertility is access to crops and a climate suitable for farming them. For example, maize farming spread through the American Southwest, but not to California, where the indigenous tribes continued to live as hunter-gatherers. Why? Maize is a relatively thirsty crop that is best-grown in temperatures of 21-27\u02daC. It does not grow well in California without irrigation, because the summers are too dry and the winters are too cool.\n\n**Farming in the Neolithic Mississippi Valley**\n\nThere are two ways that crops suitable for farming in the local climate could appear in the area: either by domesticating local plants, or use domesticated ones introduced from elsewhere. (By domesticating, we mean selectively breeding them to make them suitable for farming.) Since the Americas were isolated from the Old World, crops could only be introduced from other parts of the Americas. They had no access to useful crops like wheat, barley, rye, millet and rice.\n\nThe first farming societies began in the area around Cahokia over 7,000 years ago, based on plants that had been domesticated within the region, including: squash (including pumpkins), sunflowers, little barley and sumpweed. The farming societies that grew out of these crops are known as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC). However, the EAC did not produce an urbanised society. Their agriculture had an advantage over hunter-gatherer lifestyles, but did not produce enough food to support an urbanised society.\n\nMaize was a much more useful staple crop than anything the EAC could offer. It was domesticated around the same time or possibly earlier in tropical Mesoamerica, alongside other plants such as local beans, tomatoes and pineapples. Due to barriers caused by geography, especially climate differences, it was slow to spread. It had to cross through the arid climates of Northern Mexico, through deserts and mountains and then into the warm to hot climates with wet summers of the Southern US. It eventually got there. By contrast, potatoes, another useful staple crop, did not spread out of South America in pre-Columbian times.\n\nWhen maize reached the Mississippi Valley around 500-1000 AD, it transformed local farming. The EAC crops were abandoned, apart from squash and sunflowers. Squash grew well alongside imported maize and beans; they were often grown together as the \"Three Sisters\". The result was that agriculture became more productive and made urbanisation possible for the first time. However, the farming was less productive and resilient than both the farming societies in the Old World and than the level needed to make an urbanised society more sustainable.\n\nAnother consequence of the region's isolation from the Old World was that they lacked draft animals and inventions like the iron plough that could have made farming more productive.\n\nI'm not sure what your question is about the Spanish and sugar cane.

The Soviet military even in its last years (when morale, order and budgets were crumbling) was something on the scale of 5 million personnel, and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads, tens of thousands of battle tanks, bombers and fighter aircraft which were considered competitive with their Western counterparts. Even the Soviet Navy, despite having beefed-up ship numbers (over a thousand) from not retiring obsolete ships, was still able to put a formidable number of modern ships to sea: aircraft carriers, ballistic missile submarines, nuclear attack submarines, as well as a variety of modern destroyers and frigates.\n\nAnd the Soviet military was very much not just based in the USSR. It was part of a larger military alliance (the Warsaw Pact), that included Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria (as well as Albania to 1968). The Soviets not only stationed substantial numbers of troops in these countries, but these countries themselves provided large militaries (much larger than these current countries have) that were part of the Soviet alliance system. \n\nAnd that's not all: the USSR had troops stationed in other friendly socialist countries. Perhaps most notoriously Afghanistan after 1979, but also (much more peacefully) in Soviet military bases in Mongolia, Vietnam, Cuba, Ethiopia and South Yemen as late as 1989. And *that* isn't counting the countries that were not technically Marxist-Leninist like these others, but were at various points on good political terms with the USSR, and received Soviet aid and thousands of military and civil advisors. This number at various points included China, India, Indonesia, Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Syria, Iraq and Guinea. And *that* doesn't include the numerous Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary\/insurgent groups that received support and training from Soviet authorities or Soviet allies. \n\nThe Soviet military and arms industry were massive, and made up perhaps 15 to 20% of the total Soviet economy. The USSR was the third largest country by population at its fall: China and India alone were larger. It also spent much of the Cold War being one of the biggest economies in the world, not so much for it's wealth (on per capita terms it was similar to Argentina or Mexico) as for its size from its large population. Even so its economy at its best was about a third the size of the US, although I should note that the USSR didn't use prices like a market economy and so estimates of Soviet GDP could vary quite a bit between the economic specialists in the West who tried to compare it to other countries. \n\nAfter the Second World War, even with the massive devastation the USSR suffered, it was therefore just still that much *bigger* than most other economies, except the US (which in 1945 was something like a good half of the world's industrial output). Germany and Japan were physically devastated, and France and Britain largely broke, with much of the world still very agricultural and poor, or emerging from colonialism or recovering from war devastation, or all three. The USSR had some of the highest annual economic growth rates of any country in this period as well, which made it something of a model for developing countries. However, as the decades went on, the Soviet economy grew at ever smaller rates (but it still grew), and the gap did not close with more advanced Western economies, which moved into post-industrial information and high tech industries, while the USSR had trouble making such leaps. It began to be surpassed by countries like Japan, and was just not moving ahead. \n\nThe Soviet breakup not only broke up this single economic unit (Russia being 3\/4 of Soviet territory but only 1\/2 of its population, with much of the best farmland, oil resources, and advanced industries in other republics), but all 15 of the successor states went through massive turbulence in the switch from centralized to market economies. GDP plunged *massively* - Ukraine and Russia saw their GDP fall by half in the 1990s). Life expectancies crashed, and populations shrank in many republics. Immigration saw millions move between the republics, and quite a few of the most educated and most skilled leaving the former USSR forever. For Russia the economic turnaround didn't come until 2000 and the Russian economy didn't reach its pre-1991 size until the middle of the 2000s.

Similarly, they exaggerated actually extant practices of cannibalism- the Jesuit Relations have some very lurid tales of cannibalism, in the telling of which getting support for their mission probably outweighed the truth. In response to that, some academics have argued that all cannibalism is just a myth- see, for example, W. Arens' The Man-Eating Myth, in which he looks at all these accounts of cannibalistic groups and finds that cannibalism is always an accusation against others. \n\nExcept, of course, that he was wrong. Look at, for example, Beth Conklin's Consuming Grief: Compassionate Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society. This is an ethnography of the Wari' people, who practised funerary cannibalism, miss it very much, and were quite happy to talk to her about it. There certainly have been groups that practised cannibalism, especially in lowland South America and Melanesia. Denying that is itself an imposition of Western cultural values.\n\nAt the same time, though, cannibalism has, since the days of Herodotus' androphagi, been a stereotype of uncivilized outsiders, and the figure of the cannibalistic native was used to justify colonialism. Cannibalism has been attributed to many native groups that never practised, and we should be skeptical when reading some European's account that says those guys the next valley over totally eat people. \n\n(And of course, as Conklin points out, at the same time as Europeans were spreading cannibal myths to justify colonialism, they were themselves practising medical cannibalism- the consumption of corpse parts in the belief that, say, the blood of an executed man would cure epilepsy, or powdered mummy injuries.

From the Antiquity to the mid 20th century, human and animal traction was a common method to power freight transportation on inland waters, not just in Britain but throughout the world. Here's a bas-relief of [people towing a boat](https:\/\/commons.m.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Commerce_du_vin_sur_la_Durance_\\(%C3%A9poque_gallo-romaine\\).png) loaded with wine barrels on the Durance river (southern France) in the Gallo-Roman period. Here's a photo of [a pair of horses towing a barge on the Finow canal](https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Finowkanal-treidel.jpg) in Brandenbourg, Germany, circa 1880. The Grand Canal in China, built in the first millenia, still [features ancient towpaths](http:\/\/english.wujiang.gov.cn\/wujiang\/worldheritage\/202003\/730103244b5d4c268fefc5c141826285.shtml). A Japanese example is shown in Hiroshige's [*Towboats Along the Yotsugi-d\u014dri Canal*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Towpath#\/media\/File:100_views_edo_033.jpg) from the mid-19th century.\n\nBefore the advent of steam- or combustion-powered engines, transporting heavy and bulky goods was done more efficiently by water than by roads. In 1699, French military engineer Vauban wrote a memoir about the organisation and navigability of French waterways and described the benefit of transporting all sorts of heavy and bulky goods - wine, salt, fodder, coal, grains, timber, stones... - by water compared to road transportation.\n\n>All this can be done easily and inexpensively by water, because a boat of reasonable size, by good water, can alone, with six men and four horses, carry the load that two hundred men and four hundred horses would have great difficulty to transport by ordinary roads.\n\nWhen goods had to be carried upstream, from ports and production centres to areas of consumption, pulling boats was a more practical, efficient, and cheaper method than the alternatives. Towing provided the strength of several men, or the even greater strength of horses. It was predictable and reliable, unlike wind power. In addition, towed boats could pass under bridges and tunnels, which was more difficult or even impossible for sailboats. \n\nIn any case, local conditions influenced greatly the use of towing. The review of towing practices in the Rhone in the 15th century by Rossiaud (1976) shows an already complex organisation, with entire convoys being pulled upstream by gangs of several hundreds men on the 300 km between Arles and Lyon. By the early 1500s, men had been replaced (mostly) by horses, and sometimes by oxen, possibly due to difficulties in recruitment caused by falling demographics. Horses may have been eventually found to be more manageable than rowdy humans... On the Dordogne river, boats were smaller and towing was human-powered until the mid-1700s when they were replaced by oxen (Braudel, 2009). On the Seine, the depth of the valley and its meanders made sailing useless, so towing from Rouen to Paris was used for both downstream and upstream navigation. In 1777, 90% of the boats were towed, corresponding to 450 trips using 2000 horses. The Rouen-Paris-Rouen rotation took one month. Upstream barges could require up to 12 horses. Downstream barges flowed by themselves, but still used two horses for manoeuvring (Decoux, 1994). About towing in England, Charles Haldfield wrote (1966):\n\n>Towing on the river navigations was usually by gangs of men, a practice that continued well into the nineteenth century. On the Severn Telford, writing at the turn of the eighteenth century, referred to \u2018the present barbarous and expensive custom of performing this slave-like office by men\u2019. A witness giving evidence on the Severn Towing Path Bill of 1803 said that about 150 men were employed upon this work on the twenty-four miles from Bewdley to Coalbrookdale. The cost of towing this distance was 3s. per man, each of whom was reckoned to pull three tons. He estimated that one horse could do the work of six men, at a third less cost. Within the next twenty years a horse towing path was made upwards to Shrewsbury and downwards to Gloucester.\n\nHorses, donkeys, mules etc. were also commonly used in British waterways. Haldfield cites a writer describing the poor conditions of the horses working on the towpaths of the Birmingham Canal in 1783.\n\n>The boats [...] are each drawn by something like the skeleton of a horse, covered with skin: whether he subsists upon the scent of the water, is a doubt; but whether his life is a scene of affliction, is not; for the unfeeling driver has no employment but to whip him from one end of the canal to the other. While the teams practised the turnpike road, the lash was divided among five unfortunate animals, but now the whole wrath of the driver falls upon one.\n\nTowing required lands on the riversides that were already used for other purposes or belonged to other people. This had to be negotiated with the local populations and landowners, who often resented the nuisances caused by towing gangs, such as damages to properties and theft (of \"Hennes, Geese, Duckes, Piggs, Swans, Eggs, Woode and all other such Commodytyes\" as reported by an English committee in 1791, cited by Haldfield, 1966). Towing also needed a proper infrastructure of well-built and well-maintained towpaths. Unlike men and oxen, horses required a firm and solid ground made of paving stones (Decoux, 1994). Finally, specialised equipments and teams were necessary. The latter could be independant contractors, employees of the barge master, of the shipping company, or of the canal owners, as was the case at the Regent's canal in England, who provided its own horses after 1847 (Haldfield, 1966). \n\nAll of this resulted in Europe in complex agreements betwen central authorities, local polities, and entrepreneurs, meant to make sure that towing was feasible and beneficial. The [ordinance of King Fran\u00e7ois 1 of May 1520](https:\/\/gallica.bnf.fr\/ark:\/12148\/bpt6k51698f\/f177.item), noting that previous royal rulings (notably an ordinance of Charles VI from February 1415) were badly enforced and respected, gave instructions regarding the towing paths on the Seine, stating that they should be unencumbered and of 24 feet in width (for horses): the merchandises carried by boats were too often delayed and damaged due to the poor maintenance of the towpaths \"to the detriment of the public good\". This went hand in hand with the development of canals, which created \"highway\" networks for river transportation. By the 18th century, boat-towing was an industry on its own, and it only disappeared in the 1960s in some areas.\n\nNow, what about the picture of a [barge-towing horse](https:\/\/www.alamy.com\/scholars-by-the-river-cam-a-horse-pulling-a-barge-beneath-a-bridge-clare-hall-on-the-right-hand-side-view-of-clare-hall-cambridge-before-1774-pen-and-black-ink-with-monochrome-wash-source-maps-ktop865b-language-english-image226822128.html) in the River Cam? Towing horses and men were not supposed to be wading in the water! It did happen sometimes when the towpath was poorly maintained or in areas where it could be submerged by the tide. Decoux cites examples in Normandy where the drivers had to cling desperately to horses that were half under water (they were even authorized to cut free if it there was a risk to the horse). But this was not the case for the River Cam, which had an unusual feature in the section below the walls of the colleges: a submerged towpath in the middle of the river. Stephanie Boyd, in her recent popular history of Cambridge, writes (Boyd, 2005):\n\n>There was no continuous towpath along the Backs and the college banks were steep and high, making it virtually impossible for horses to pull barges from the riverbank. This led to the curious sight of boats being pulled along by horses, wading in the middle of the river along an underwater towpath. \n\n**Sources**\n\n* Beyer, Antoine. \u2018Les grands jalons de l\u2019histoire des voies navigables fran\u00e7aises\u2019.

I detailed one occasion previously in a different sub and will post that response in full below, but first let's add a bit of context. McClellan was replaced in Nov of 1862 by Burnside who sought a stronghold around Fredericksburg, Virginia. Over 100,000 Union soldiers were poised to cross the Rappahannock into Fredericksburg but their pontoons were late, delaying this crossing and allowing the Confederate forces an opportunity to entrench. The Union army was peppered with sniper fire from the cities buildings while attempting to cross, eventually securing (and raiding\/sacking) the town of Fredericksburg. Just west of town, however, an army had dug in and was waiting for them. The battlefield can almost be described as an amphitheater, with Confederate artillery in the \"lawn\" section and a stone wall at the base of the hill (our \"mezzanine\") on which they sat, that wall lined three deep with every rifle baring man Longstreet could find. This is what the Union was faced with overcoming as they approached from the \"stage\" of our amphitheater. In military strategy, it was an ideal situation for the Confederacy - their canons rained down furiously upon the advancing army while those men at the wall fired endlessly into the approaching ranks. Just south from this engagement Franklin tangled with Stonewall, briefly pushing his forces through the lines before they were devastated by a counterattack launched by Jackson, pushing the Union soldiers back. Franklin had undercommitted his troops and this position was vital as it was the zipper planned to roll up the Confederate flanks as they faced a major frontal assault on the batteries and battalions on Marye's Heights. With this effort stalled the attacking soldiers to the north, too far advanced from their own artillery to recieve any support, were marching into a defined kill zone. Of the ~100,000 Union soldiers and ~75,000 Confederate soldiers over 12,000 Union soldiers and roughly 6,000 Confederate soldiers would perish on these fields, most being killed in the action on Dec 12, 1862. The Union soldiers piled up on the plains of Fredericksburg, the place that the Confederate artillery commander had informed Longstreet a \"chicken could not survive\" upon once his batteries thundered to life. He was right; 7,500 of the Union casualties happened here and no Union soldier made it close enough to touch the stone wall. These same men would soon be wishing one another a Merry Christmas.\n\n---\n\nUS Civil War, Christmas on the Rappahannock, 1862, just after Fredericksburg;\n\n>It was Christmas Day, 1862. \u201cAnd so this is war,\u201d my old me said to himself while he paced in the snow his two hours on the river\u2019s brink. \u201cAnd I am out here to shoot that lean, lank, coughing, cadaverous-looking butternut fellow over the river. So this is war; this is being a soldier; this is the genuine article; this is H. Greely\u2019s \u2018On to Richmond.\u2019 Well, I wish he were here in my place, running to keep warm, pounding his arms and breast to make the chilled blood circulate. So this is war, tramping up and down this river my fifty yards with wet feet, empty stomach, swollen nose.\u201d\n\n>Alas, when lying under the trees in the college campus last June, war meant to me martial music, gorgeous brigadiers in blue and gold, tall young men in line, shining in brass. War meant ot me tumultuous memories of Bunker Hill, Caesar\u2019s Tenth Legion, the Charge of the Six Hundred, \u2013 anything but this. Pshaw, I wish I were home. Let me see. Home? God\u2019s country. A tear? Yes, it is a tear. What are they doing at home? This is Christmas Day. Home? Well, stockings on the wall, candy, turkey, fun, merry Christmas, and the face of the girl I left behind. Another tear? Yes, I couldn\u2019t help it. I was only eighteen, and there was such a contrast between Christmas, 1862, on the Rappahannock and other Christmases. Yes, there was a girl, too, \u2013 such sweet eyes, such long lashes, such a low tender voice.\n\n>\u201cCome, move quicker. Who goes there?\u201d Shift the rifle from one aching shoulder to the other.\n\n>\u201cHello, Johnny, what are you up to?\u201d The river was narrow, but deep and swift. It was a wet cold, not a freezing cold. There was no ice, too swift for that.\n\n>\u201cYank, with no overcoat, shoes full of holes, nothing to eat but parched corn and tabacco, and with this derned Yankee snow a foot deep, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 left, nothin\u2019 but to get up a cough by way of protestin\u2019 against this infernal ill treatment of the body. We uns, Yank, all have a cough over here, and there\u2019s no sayin\u2019 which will run us to hole first, the cough or your bullets.\u201d\n\n>The snow still fell, the keen wind, raw and fierce, cut to the bone. It was God\u2019s worst weather, in God\u2019s forlornest, bleakest spot of ground, that Christmas Day of \u201962 on the Rappahannock, a half-mile below the town of Fredericksburg. But come, pick up your prostrate pluck, you shivering private. Surely there is enough dampness around without your adding to it your tears.\n\n>\u201cLet\u2019s laugh, boys.\u201d\n\n>\u201cHello, Johnny.\u201d\n\n>\u201cHello, yourself, Yank.\u201d\n\n>\u201cMerry Christmas, Johnny.\u201d\n\n>\u201cSame to you, Yank.\u201d\n\n>\u201cSay, Johnny, got anything to trade?\u201d\n\n>\u201cParched corn and tabacco, \u2013 the size of our Christmas, Yank.\u201d\n\n>\u201cAll right; you shall have some of our coffee and sugar and pork. Boys, find the boats.\u201d\n\n>Such boats! I see the children sailing them on small lakes in our Central park. Some Yankee, desperately hungry for tobacco, invented them for trading with the Johnnies. They were hid away under the backs of the river for successive relays of pickets.\n\n>We got out the boats. An old handkerchief answered for a sail. We loaded them with coffee, sugar, pork, and set the sail and watched them slowly creep to the other shore. And the Johnnies? To see them crowd the bank and push and scramble to be the first to seize the boats, going into the water and stretching out their long arms. Then, when they pulled the boats ashore, and stood in a group over the cargo, and to hear their exclamations, \u201cHurrah for hog.\u201d \u201cSay, that\u2019s not roasted rye, but genuine coffee. Smell it, you\u2019uns.\u201d \u201cAnd sugar, too!\u201d\n\n>Then they divided the consignment. They laughed and shouted, \u201cReckon you\u2019uns been good to we\u2019uns this Christmas Day, Yanks.\u201d Then they put parched corn, tobacco, ripe persimmons, into the boats and sent them back to us. And we chewed the parched corn, smoked real Virginia leaf, ate persimmons, which if they weren\u2019t very filling at least contracted our stomachs to the size of our Christmas dinner. And so the day passed. We shouted, \u201cMerry Christmas, Johnny.\u201d They shouted, \u201cSame to you, Yank.\u201d And we forgot the biting wind, the chilling cold; we forgot those men over there were our enemies, whom it might be our duty to shoot before evening.\n\n>We had bridged the river, spanned the bloody chasm. We were brothers, not foes, waving salutations of good-will in the name of the Babe of Bethlehem, on Christmas Day in \u201962. At the very front of the opposing armies, the Christ Child struck a truce of us, broke down the wall of partition, became our peace. We exchanged gifts. We shouted greetings back and forth. We kept Christmas and our hears were lighter of it, and our shivering bodes were not quite so cold.\n\n*Reverend John Paxton, a member of the 140th\u00a0Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry recalling his service in Harper's Weekly, 1886*\n\nA few miles up the Rappahannock, in a separate instance, the Johnny's (southerners) invited the Billy's (northerners) to come celebrate Christmas in their camp (they were likewise celebrating victory at Fredericksburg). Some did, and on the New Year the Billy's returned the favor, inviting Johnny's to come to their camp. They did, and after an officer came to investigate the noise from that camp he had the Johnny's arrested. Being responsible for the situation, the Billy's of that regiment escorted the Johnny's to the command tent and demanded they be allowed to leave as they came by invitation and under truce - the command agreed and they were released, after both sides promised not to do it anymore.\n\nIn another somewhat interesting twist of war, Gen Blackjack Logan was approaching the Flint River near Jonesboro, Ga, when a concealed confederate cannon battery opened fire on then from the trees. They responded with cannon fire of their own but quickly noticed a man outside a cabin waving a yellow flag, an indication of a medical area. Logan sent a dispatch which returned asking for assistance. When they arrived they found an old man and old woman along with the man's daughter in law, who was in labor on the bed. A cannonball had hit the cabin and a second flew through the roof, hit the wall, hit the headboard of the bed (splitting it), landed on the mattress, then came to rest on the floor. This prompted the man to come out with the flag. Logan quickly ordered his men to disengage with the confederates and make hasty repairs to the cabin as best they could. He also ordered the surgeon to assist in the delivery. The chaplain was brought forward to christen the child \"marvelous escape from a shell\" which translated as \"Shellanna Marvilier\", and Logan became the child's godfather, gifting her his gold pocket watch. Her father, Thomas, and her uncle, David, were both in Elmira Prison camp when this happened. \n\nThomas was my ggg-grandfather.\n\n(E for typo)","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678119500.0}]},{"title":"In war movies they portray a lot of deaths in a short period of time.

Let\u2019s take eastern North America as our example. The Chickasaws and Upper Creeks were noted as relying on footpaths for transit and trade by most everyone who encountered them until they started making use of horses. But the Anishinaabe and other Algonquian peoples of the Great Lakes were famously talented with their birchbark canoes. These canoes were very light and waterproof. The Odawa in particular were noted as people especially talented boaters. The River systems of the Northwest made it easy to travel anywhere by canoe, much easier than walking. Further south, Hernando de Soto encountered a group of people called the Quizquiz (probably the Natchez) who were noted as being extremely skilled with their 30-foot dugout canoes. De Soto tried to fight them in the River but they were skilled enough to actively toy with him during the fight. They whipped his conquistador ass and sent him packing down the Mississippi\n\nSources:\n\n- *Narratives of the career of Hernando de Soto in the conquest of Florida, as told by a knight of Elvas, and in a relation by Luys Hern\u00e1ndez de Biedma, factor of the expedition*\n\n- Jacob Lee, *Masters of the Middle Waters: Indian Nations and Colonial Ambitions Along the Mississippi*\n\n- Michael A.

Many niche alternative artists and subcultures became mainstream during this period.   \n\n\nThe decade saw grunge, nu-metal, industrial rock and alternative rock go from niche genres to widespread popularity. Rap, heavy metal and punk also experienced a boost in popularity.

The Simpsons, although now considered fairly tame, was quite controversial at the time for featuring more edgy characters and storylines. South Park premiered in 1997, and in 1999 we got Family guy, two shows which became popular due to their dark and edgy humor.\n\n\n90s were also the peak of emo and skater subcultures, as well as other similar subcultures focused on rejecting mainstream cultural norms and embracing more edgy identity.\n\n\n\n90s were essentially the time when counterculture became mainstream culture.

There were actually rumors through much of Charles's reign that the Duke of Monmouth was going to be legitimized and made his heir. Monmouth was an attractive prospect for it due to his age, his good looks, his noble titles, and his intimacy with his father - he was also a Protestant, which was hugely important to the Anglican community, as the proper heir presumptive was James, Duke of York, who was widely suspected\/known to be Catholic. Whenever it was implied that something was going on in the royal family dynamics - when he supported the divorce of John and Anne Manners, Earl and Countess of Rutland, which seemed like it could be a precedent for his own divorce; when the Duke of York married the Italian Catholic Mary of Modena; when Parliament tried to force Charles to exclude his brother from the line of succession - the rumors flared up again. And Monmouth was pretty convinced of them himself. At one point, he made an appearance in Liverpool where he actually made a show of touching people with scrofula, the disease which was supposedly cured by the king's touch, and the persistent rumor that his mother had married Charles and so he *was* the legitimate heir already was one he supported. All of this resulted in the Monmouth Rebellion a few months after Charles's death, as Monmouth attempted to take the throne he believed ought to have been his.\n\nBut Charles never supported Monmouth's ambitions. He always maintained that he would stay married to Catherine of Braganza even though she was evidently not going to have a child, and that the Duke of York would be his successor. So. Why?\n\nSomething that's difficult for us to compute today is the idea of there being anything mystical about kingship. We have so, so many stories where being king is solely about wielding the ultimate power in the land, and where it can be stolen or given away solely on the basis of force, and most people today are naturally cynical of idea of spirituality\/divinity having any real place in determining a country's leader. The popular, othering impression of historical monarchies also tends to be that passing the throne to a \\~\\*\\~son and heir\\~\\*\\~ was more important than anything else. However, in both cases, the popular thought is wrong.\n\nThe importance of bloodline to royalty cannot be overstated. Royalty typically married royalty, or at least the quasi-royalty of the sovereign dukes of places like Savoy and Parma (like Mary of Modena). It was not typical but they did sometimes stoop to marry their own noble subjects, and almost never members of the gentry (like Anne Hyde, the Duke of York's first wife). I've described European royalty in past answers as very nearly their own ethnic group, because there was almost no marriage in or out, although they did tend to marry widely within the class in general, despite stereotypes. This helped keep them separate from their subjects - unreachable, except through servitude and\/or illicit sexual relationships. Legitimizing a son who'd been birthed and partially raised by a very low-born woman could seem like a fairy tale or a case of the royal blood \"winning out\", as it likely did to Monmouth and his supporters, but it could also seem like defiling and degrading the very concept of kingship. Charles had most likely been traumatized by the execution of his father on the orders of Parliament and his own impoverished exile, so he was not likely to take any actions that could lead anyone to think that a king could be just some guy.\n\nI've also written a few times about father -> son inheritance of kingship. The fact is that it was often an enormous propaganda boost, a sign that god blessed your reign by ensuring that it passed directly to your son, but it was by no means the be all, end all. It was perfectly acceptable for the king's brother or nephew to inherit his throne, if he didn't have any children. It was not a crisis for Charles to be succeeded by his brother rather than his son. There was absolutely no need to legitimize Monmouth or any other children of his, when he had a brother and two nieces.\n\n(For more on Charles II, I strongly recommend *Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II* by Stephen Coote. It's been some time since I read it all the way through, but I think it's a good look at him.)","upvotes":40,"created_utc":1677888372.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677865952.0}]},{"title":"The six-sided die (d6) has become the most popular die, and is often treated as the standard die.

Keep in mind that I'll use the same method, ie reading his cited sources and seeing what they actually say. \n\nPinker in *Better Angels of Our Nature* states: \"The worst atrocity of all time was the An Lushan Revolt and Civil war, an eight-year rebellion during China's Tang Dynasty that, according to censuses, resulted in the loss of two-thirds of the empire's population, a sixth of the world's population at the time.\" Further down in the text he gives 36,000,000 dead.\n\nPinker has an end note attached to this statement. The endnote reads:\n\n>\"13. An Lushan Revolt: White notes that the figure is controversial. Some historians attribute it to migration or the breakdown of the census; others treat it as credible, because subsistence farmers would have been highly vulnerable to a disruption of irrigation infrastructure.\"\n\nSo right there his source is Matthew White, ie a self-described \"atrocitologist\" and [some guy on the Internet](http:\/\/users.erols.com\/mwhite28\/index.htm) who later turned his website into a book (that Pinker wrote a favorable blurb for). Even White acknowledges that that figure is controversial, although Pinker rather unhelpfully doesn't mention the \"some\" or \"others\" who debate the figures. \n\nOK, off to White's [website](https:\/\/necrometrics.com\/pre1700a.htm#AnLushan) to find *his* sources. You'll note that he doesn't actually claim 36 million - he says 13 million. And on top of that, what he admits was actually being counted were households, which tended to be 8 to 9 million before the rebellion and 4 to 5 million even a century after the rebellion. Of course it's already not a modern census of total population, let alone an accurate count of people killed in the rebellion, and White admits to doing estimates that he then revises to come up with a \"conservative\" figure of 13 million. \n\nAnyway, let's plow through White's listed sources.\n\nFirst is a book by Sanderson Beck titled *China, Korea and Japan to 1800*. Beck has a BA in dramatic art, an MA in religious studies and a PhD in education, and is a self-styled world peace advocate, so I'm not really sure why he'd be considered a reputable source on medieval Chinese history (he as a zillion self published book with psychedelic covers on every part of the world's history). Anyway, even Beck states that \"As regional commanders became more independent, the decline of the central government is indicated by the census figures for the next year [764] that showed a population of 16,900,000 compared to 52,880,488 ten years earlier.\" So even in Beck's own terms, the decline of 36 million is directly due to regional rulers breaking with the central government (and thus limiting the households tallied in the census), not everyone dying.\n\nOK, let's move on to the next source. This one is a bit more reputable, and I believe is actually the source for most of the other listed sources (many of them are tertiary sources, one is even an undergraduate course syllabus). This is Durand, JD, \u201cThe population statistics of China, AD 2 \u2013 1953,\u201d *Population Studies* (1960), Vol. 13, No. 3, p.209,223, which is available via JSTOR [here](https:\/\/www-jstor-org.ezproxy.bpl.org\/stable\/2172247?seq=9).\n\nAgain, Durand throws a giant caveat over his own interpretations of figures:\n\n>\"These statistics are full of faults which make it obviously impossible to put much confidence in them as measures either of the exact size of the population at any time or of its changes during any period. Their ups and downs are often patently incredibly, and the numbers of persons and households are sometimes inconsistent. Conflicting figures for the same date are found in different sources, and when statistics are given for parts of the country they do not always add to the totals recorded for China as a whole.\"\n\nThat seems like a pretty massive caveat Durand gives for his own figures. He also goes on to state that any figures pre-Qing are at best \"tax-paying units\" and not estimates of the entire population as a whole, although there is fragmentary evidence that at earlier times and places more complete lists of household members were collected.\n\nAnyways, Durand in the piece does give the 52.8 million estimate in 754 to 16.9 million estimate in 760. He however qualifies these figures by stating:\n\n>\"Between A.D. 705 and 75 5 to all appearances the census machinery functioned  much more effectively; but after 75 5 it broke down again. The recorded number of persons dropped from nearly 53 millions in the year 755 to only 17 millions in 760. During this time China was torn by revolts which were suppressed with bloody force, including the notorious rebellion of An Lu-Shan. Many historians have affirmed that 36 million lives were lost as a result of these violent events, but Fitzgerald and others have shown that this is incredible.Even if such a huge loss were conceivable, it would be naive to suppose that an accurate count of the survivors could have been carried out in the midst of the ensuing chaos.\nActually, the census of the year 760 fell far short of covering the whole empire; Balazs notes that only i69 commanderies-less than half the total of A.D. 754 -are represented in the record. It is unlikely that any of the censuses which were taken from this time to the end of the T'ang dynasty approximated complete coverage.\"\n\nSo in Durand's take, even if the censuses up to 755 accurately represent the whole population, the censuses after this time absolutely do not, and only covered half of the localities that were covered previously. \n\nJust to read into Durand's footnote for this section:\n\"33 Fitzgerald (I 2), pp. 142-44; also (I 3)\"\n\nAnd the overall discussion is over these three sources:\n\n - Balazs, Stefan. \" Beitraege zur Wirtschaftsgeschichte der T'ang-Zeit (6I8-906) \". Mittheilungen des Seminars fuer Orientalische Sprachen Zu Berlin. Erste Abteilung (Ostasiatische Studien). Jahrgang XXXIV, pp. I-92; XXXV, pp. 1-73; XXXVI, pp. I-6z. I93I-I933. (Berlin. Universitit. Ausland-Hochschule. Mittheilungen.)\n\n - Bielenstein, Hans. \" The census of China during the period 2-742 A.D.\" Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities (Stockholm), No. I9. 1947.\n\n - Fitzgerald, C. P. \" A new estimate of the Chinese population under the T'ang Dynasty in 618  A.D.\" The China Journal (Shanghai), Vol. XVI, No. I, pp. 5-I4; No. 2, pp. 62-72. Jan.-Feb. 1932\n\nSo we are discussing 80 to 90 year old sources, and even in Durand's case he doesn't bother to cite the \"many historians\" who claim that the 36 million loss is killed, just the one historian who doesn't accept this. Fitzgerald is cited by White as a separate source, just to make things confusing, and White provides a quote from Fitzgerald that emphasizes his skepticism that the number drop is killed: \"The real cause of the decline in the figures for the censuses after the rebellion was the dispersion of the officials who had been in charge of the revenue department.\"\n\nSo honestly it's a claim that I can't really find any substantiation for - this one actually seems worse than the Genghis Khan claim because there are only ever vague mentions of Trump style \"many people\" who think the 36 million drop accurately refers to deaths, but every cited source specifically *denies* that this is the case, but rather that it was a collapse in central government record keeping. \n\nBut there you go - the An Lushan Rebellion was treated as 36 million killed by Pinker, and Pinker also used (completely unrelated and unreliable) estimates of the world population (probably one of [these](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/data\/tables\/time-series\/demo\/international-programs\/historical-est-worldpop.html)) in the mid 8th century AD to come up with the one-sixth of humans killed, and boom, a factoid is born, and spreads via the Internet.","upvotes":43,"created_utc":1677873402.0}]},{"title":"was kung-fu actually used for figthing?","author":"GreenHandbag2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11h3r5p\/was_kungfu_actually_used_for_figthing\/","text":"Was kung-fu actually used for combat in ancient China or was it more of a spiritual exercise?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677857978.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

With millions of French dead, the US came in at the last moment and Wilson played a key role in the Treaty negotiations. Alongside that, the French leaders asked that US troops be placed under their generalship rather than independently. General Pershing refused the offer excluding a few black units.

In your case, when you're referring to the Bronze Age, this typically refers to Shang through the Early Spring and Autumn period, thereafter iron becomes more and more common. I'm not an expert on Ancient Chinese religion or ritual by any means, but you probably would want to focus on the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties. A very good starter source is  \n\n*Early Chinese Religion: Shang Through Han (1250 BC-220 AD)* edited by  John Lagerway and Marc Kalinowski.\n\nAnother resource that's recent (it was released a month ago) is *Kingship, Ritual, and Royal Ideology in Western Zhou China* by Paul Nicholas Vogt, but I have not read that one yet. It seems to be an expansion on his very excellent PhD dissertation on Western Zhou rituals which may be of interest and is available here: [https:\/\/academiccommons.columbia.edu\/doi\/10.7916\/D8765NHR\/download](https:\/\/academiccommons.columbia.edu\/doi\/10.7916\/D8765NHR\/download)\n\nThough this next source is not really quite in the Bronze Age, Pu Mu-chou's *Beliefs and Practices in Everyday Life of the Han Dynasty* may shine some light back on early Zhou beliefs, thought that requires some caution. Qin, Han, and Warring States sources are more similar to each other than to Bronze Age Chinese sources in general. I believe Anthony Barbieri-Loewe also has several books on this topic that I have not personally read too.\n\nI will say that there is a lot that we don't know about Ancient Chinese religion, but our research on this topic has been accelerating since we keep on discovering more and more sites on Ancient China. If you are diligent with your search you will find tonnes and tonnes of sources. And as with all historical topics, religion is embedded into society, so if you search on topics such as warfare (religion and warfare are intimately related in Ancient China, especially during the Shang), you might also obtain new information or context on your topic of interest (try Mark Edward Lewis's *Sanctioned Violence in Early China* to find an extensive discussion of religion and how that relates to warfare in Bronze Age China). \n\nAlso be aware that a lot of older sources extrapolated back Warring States era sources on religion back to earlier periods and may be unrepresentative. However, lots of mainland Chinese and Taiwanese historiography utilizes those sources with caution, and if you can read some Chinese, perhaps picking up Yang Kuan's *Zhanguoshi* \\[History of the Warring States\\] may be informative as well.\n\nGood luck!","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1677889825.0},{"author":"TheOtherCann","text":"**Religion**\n\nJust adding to the recommendation of John Lagerway's work \\[*Early Chinese Religion: Shang Through Han* (2009)\\]. There are a few additional volumes added in this series, which he also co-edited. Fortunately, he has provided an introductory book -- to all volumes -- in his *Paradigm Shifts in Early and Modern Chinese Religion - A History* (2018). So, if you're looking for something less heavy (literally, the 2009 book is over 1,200 pages), this newer introductory book may be a way in to ancient Chinese religion.\n\n**Ritual**\n\nAs for ritual practice, your timing is impeccable! I am reading (very slowly) Vogt's *Kingship, Ritual, and Royal Ideology in Western Zhou China* (2023). His certainty and confidence in his own work can be inspiring, because his opening sentence is:\n\n>This book ***rewrites*** the history of the ritual performed by early Chinese kings of the Western Zhou period (c. 1045-771 BCE) \\[*my emphasis*\\].\n\n**Confucianism**\n\nJust as we cannot separate Chinese religion from ancient Chinese society as if it's a separate practice from daily life, I would also recommend that you consider a book on Confucianism as a *living practice* (as opposed to philosophical purpose). In this vein a good, short book is *Creating Confucian Authority - The Field of Ritual Learning in Early China to 9 CE* (2021). It might not be substantive enough for your needs but it might help provide a more complete picture of early China's Confucian tradition.\n\n**\"Early China\"**\n\nFinally, as a research aid, that's the term historians of ancient China use, up until the end of Han (220 CE). And, because I am particularly interested in Western Zhou, I have enjoyed Li Feng's *Early China - A Social and Cultural History* (2015). His earlier 3 books (first 2 on state formation and last one on literacy) was particularly illuminating for me but I would not recommend them unless you've decided to focus on Western Zhou. Incidentally, Paul Nicholas Vogt (of *Kingship,* above) was mentored by Li Feng.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1677957538.0}]},{"title":"What happened to organized crime in countries occupied by Nazis during World War 2?","author":"LorneMalvoIRL","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11hm907\/what_happened_to_organized_crime_in_countries\/","text":"\nThis subject has always fascinated me but I could only find surprisingly little about it.

In a standard baseball game, most position players only gets a handful of opportunities to actually influence the game. Even the best players will only get 3-5 at bats a game and a couple defensive chances to field the ball, the rest of the time is spent sitting on the bench waiting to bat or standing in the field waiting for a ball to be hit their way. Compare that to other sports: with basketball a player may touch the ball dozens of times and defends 80 possesions a game, a soccer player has upwards of 90 minutes to run around the field and impact play. \n\nThis is compounded by the fact that the difference between a \"good\" and a \"bad\" baseball player has very fine margin. Getting a hit three times for every ten at bats is the historic gold standard for hitting proficiency, getting a hit two times for every ten at bats is grounds for demotion to the minors. When you only get 5 at bats a game, this makes induvidual games a rather hard way of evaulating talent. Mike Trout and Lebron James are both considered generational talents in their sport. Mike Trout failed to reach base in almost a 1\/5th of his games last year, whereas Lebron James hasn't scored less than 10 points in more than 18 years. Keeping long-term statistics is the only way to truly appreciate the greatness of baseball players, qualitatively watching the Barry Bonds's of the world isn't quite enough to understand how great they are, at least in comparison to say a Michael Jordan\n\nAny discussion of record keeping must begin with [Henry Chadwick](https:\/\/baseballhall.org\/hall-of-famers\/chadwick-henry). Chadwick was an extremely influential baseball person in the 1800's and as a writer developed and popularized many basic statistics that we see today. He worked for several New York outlets sharing his baseball observations and later edited for Albert Spalding's baseball seasonal recaps. Chadwick was British born and grew up around cricket (and wrote about cricket before before his baseball days), who have their own scorekeeping systems, and sought to standardize a similar system for baseball.\n\nA very basic cricket scorecard has a list of the players in their batting order and how many runs they scored during their at bat. This is fine because how many runs a cricket batsman scores is more or less directly dependent on how skilled they are as a batter. Chadwick understood that this is absolutely not the case in baseball. Players can only score when they are being driven in by another player (with the exception being a home run, which both constitute a small percentage of at bats and even a smaller percentage of at bats during Chadwick's time). If a player doesn't have good teammates, then his ability to score runs will be limited. Chadwick felt that runs had \"no criterion of a batsman skill at all\". instead, Chadwick considered \"the only correct estimate of a batsman's skill\" was batting average, or the percentage of time a player hits and reaches base absent of a fielder's error. This means that Chadwick does have to record every at bat and every time a batter gets out or gets a hit if he wants to produce a truly good account of a players batting ability\n\nWe can also see a difference between a cricket and baseball in the fact that a successful hit in cricket keeps the batsman at the proverbial plate, whereas in baseball a new person comes to bat regardless of if the batter gets a hit or not. This means that the *quality* of the hit also becomes more important. Chadwick understood that a triple is better than a single because it gives his team a better opportunity to score a run, thus he also divides up each hit into singles, doubles, triples, home runs. Chadwick also felt that walks, strikeouts, and sacrifice hits were indicative of a batter's skill and included those as well in his box scores. Even if baseball games in its early years were much more offensively oriented, it still required long-term statistical upkeep over the course of the season for a player's batting average to become reflective of a player's true skill\n\nHenry Chadwick lived into his 80's and spent almost 50 years writing about baseball, from watching amateur games in the Elysian Fields in pre-Civil War Hoboken to American League games in the early 1900's. His statistical upkeeping became the standard for other sportwriters and his view that these stats were essential to understanding the game were encoded into the culture of baseball. Batting average remained the primary way of hitting until the 21st century. The discounting of reaching base due to fielding error in a batter or pitcher's stats still remain core aspects of baseball statkeeping. Chadwick's influence is invaluable to the history of baseball by fostering an environment of adamant record keeping.\n\nAndrew Schiff's *\"The Father of Baseball\": A Biography of Henry Chadwick* is an excellent read about early statistic keeping. Chadwick himself published his views about the sport, and he lived so long ago that all of his publications are in the public domain. [Project Gutenberg](https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/author\/3069) has a couple of his baseball guides (caution: Gutenberg does not do a very good job reproducing his stat tables), and his *The Game of Base Ball* from 1868 outlines very nicely his view of the game. The couple quotes of Chadwick included in the above paragraphs are from that","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1677903941.0}]},{"title":"What was the experience of the citizen workers that helped build the Manhattan project?","author":"lizardwizard707","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11h70fa\/what_was_the_experience_of_the_citizen_workers\/","text":"I\u2019m talking about the people who were carpenters and labor workers that had no idea what they were helping build. \n\nI\u2019m interested as I recently learned my great grandfather was one of the carpenters and he apparently was gone for months. \n\nSo I\u2019m interested in what their work life was like, where did they live during this time? \n\nHow did the government pick the laborers?\n\nAlso any audiobook recommendations to learn more about this subject would be great I\u2019m currently listening to Command and Control.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677864154.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

While most scholars doubt its historicity, all surviving monastic traditions from this time believe it to have happened.\n\nThe 2nd Buddhist Council is more accepted by scholars, and probably happened 100-200 years after the Buddhas death (300-200 BC). While the details aren\u2019t known, all traditions state that a big issue that led to this were a group of monks accepting monetary donations (a big no no in early Buddhism). Most scholars agree that the second council was held on the basis of monastic rule disagreements, and a lot also say this was the first split in the monastic order.\n\nSome historical records indicated that there were various third and fourth councils, all agreed on by the traditions to be held at similar times or places, but beyond that things get muddy. The third seemed to be dealing again with monastic issues (and possibly more splits), while the fourth seems to be the compilation of the Pali Canon, definitive \u201ctext\u201d of Buddhism. The 3rd were probably held during Emperor Ashoka\u2019s reign, so again 300-200 BC, and the fourth(s) were either 100 BC or 78 CE (the latter date is from the extinct Sarvastivada school, which the current Mahayana school inherits some traditions)\n\nThere were Fifth and Sixth ones held, but both were only held by the Theravada tradition (the oldest surviving tradition today). The fifth actually was held in the 1800s, and was concerned with verify that the monks recitation of the Buddhas sayings has not changed, and to also write them down. They were very concerned with colonialism erasing Buddhism. It was also only Burmese monks. The sixth was in the 1950s, and was essentially the same as the fifth, except there was a greater diversity of monks from throughout Southeast Asia, and afterwards the recordings of the monk\u2019s recitations were printed on printing presses.","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1677870278.0}]},{"title":"why do we call the early Roman, and italic societies \"tribes\" dies this term apply to an urban society?","author":"WillingDebt8656","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11hcgbf\/why_do_we_call_the_early_roman_and_italic\/","text":"This is part of a broader set of questions I've had concerning the difference between tribes and states, kingdoms, and chiefdoms etc..","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1677871937.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Similarly, since neither Filipino language I know (Tagalog and Cebuano) has a separate word for 'leg' versus 'foot' ('paa' refers to both body parts in both languages), clearly neither Tagalogs nor Cebuanos can distinguish between the leg and the foot and have severe difficulty moving about, being unable to perceive that their leg and their foot are not quite the same thing.

When we find artifacts in these layers that can help us date those layers to particular periods. [Here](https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/zykTW11TJr5o9R3y9) is a good example of how this \"can\" look. \n\nHowever, we know that humans have been disturbing the archaeological record for an extremely long time. It's simply in our nature to dig, destroy, build anew, in places where our ancestors and\/or others have lived. **This is what some refer to as \"cultural formation processes\" meaning that they are forming an archaeological sites through the use of cultural implements, ideas, etc.** In other words, it's archaeology created by human beings. A good example of this is that we often use \"fill\" to level out places and make them flat for construction. By placing fill we are creating an archaeological site. This is an [example](https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/AhbR8d6FPEsze3bC9) of what the stratigraphy looks like when we have multiple cultural disturbances. You can see that some layers abrupt into one another.\n\n**Conversely there are \"natural formation processes\" which range from mundane events like animal disturbances and tree roots growing to more intensive processes like wind blown sand, flooding, and erosion.** We can see really see the effects of these processes in rural environments that are less prone to the disturbances of our contemporary world. These are mostly prehistoric sites.\n\nWhat you are asking here is what makes the archaeological record so challenging and so fun as you have to reconstruct how, when, and why something changed. Why did they dig a pit here and not there? Why did they build their burials on top of previous burials? Did the river shift? It is our job to reconstruct the past in the same way a detective works a crime scene (only most of us hope there isn't a dead body in the hole we are digging!)\n\nHuman beings live where others have because of a variety of reasons. People reuse, destroy, flatten, bury, and move things all the time. I think that most people don't understand the level of depth of our cultural formation processes go. A good example of this is the [African Burial Ground discovered in New York City in 1991.](https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/afbg\/learn\/historyculture\/index.htm) A historic burial ground from the late 17th and 18th centuries was found 25-30 feet beneath the surface!!! Think about how wild that is. That original burial ground was buried beneath numerous filling and urban renewal projects.\n\nTo answer your question about modern sites I would have to say it depends on the circumstances of the disturbances. I have seen entire archaeological sites pushed at the edge of river banks and replaced with fill. Archaeological records can be completely obliterated but in most instances, even densely populated areas one can find some traces of the past. Again, the African Burial Ground is a great example of how something can simply be buried and forgotten. Compare this to the [Shockoe Hill cemetery](https:\/\/www.richmondcemeteries.org\/potters-field\/) in Richmond, Virginia which has undoubtedly had less intensive occupation than New York City and yet the site is practically all gone besides maybe one locality. The burial ground examples I give are also indicative of not just human beings forgetting but also examples of deeply held racist beliefs that these places weren't worth a damn to save in the first place. So that in and of itself is an important factor to consider when looking at how archaeological site become sites in the first place.\n\nI typed this all out on my phone in bed so I apologize for any grammatical mistakes. I'll probably update this throughout the day\/weekend as I'm not sure if this answers your question.","upvotes":32,"created_utc":1677819120.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1677795451.0},{"author":"AmesCG","text":"Pardon the typo, the title should read \"Troy VIIa\" not \"Troy Troy VIIa.\"","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1677769329.0},{"author":"Lizarch57","text":">Is it really as simple as people building new homes on the ruins of old  ones, and archaeologists scrutinizing the accumulated layers of ruins?  If so, it seems like that technique only works for sites and cultures  that rebuild in that specific way -- without completely fully clearing  debris. Is that right, or is there something more fundamental about  construction and city planning that almost always preserves evidence of  the prior layer?\n\nYes, and no. Yes, because you can establish a basic outline of the settlement you are researching relatively easy. In some way or other, the layers of the settlement will roughly correspond with each other, because peolpe lived there at the same time.\n\nNo, because it might as well be that in some areas there are more layers left which will enable a more precise analysation of a certain spot inside a settlement. This will very likely roughly correspond with the general dating of your settlement, but can provide data that is confusing at first.\n\nTo give a (fictional) example: Your settlement suffered a severe destruction at some time. This destruction can be deduced from a layer of building materials that can be found on different spots inside your settlement. This makes you think that the whole thing went down, though you don't know  if this happended because of war, or an earthquake or had another reason you find no evidence of. Inside this building material\/rubble layer you can find some material that help you with some dating references. You know that the settlement was rebuild, because there a traces of houses above that destruction layer and they provide finds that have a later dating.\n\nThen you are excavating one house structure inside the settlement and there, the main destruction layer is missing. Then it can become difficult to establish in which phase of your settlement this house would have been standing.\n\nI've done some excavations in the City of Cologne in Germany. It was founded in Roman times and was inhabited all the time up to nowadays. When you have the right spot inside the city, you can have walls that were built in Roman times, reused in Medieval houses when that what once was the ground floor became the cellar. Doors were walled up, new doors were broken into, windows were closed. Floors raised or refurbished. Other stone materials, or later bricks were used. In the 19th century, some big reconstructions took place. As the building techniques were more modern, the foundations of 19th century buildings did not reuse older foundation, but built new ones, cutting through corresponding medieval layers. Usually, you can find the best preserved historical layers in places that were used as backyards. But you have to establish which layer is corresponding with which phase of the wall(s).\n\nThere are remains of the palace of the Roman Governour of the province of Germania Inferior (Lower Germania) in Cologne too. The walls of those were massive. During mediaval times, people lived in houses built on top of those foundations. The building itself collapsed presumably during Early Medieval times.\n\nIt was coomon to have a well in your backyard. The area is part of an archaeological exhibition that is currently under reconstruction, but you can walk around in the Roman remains, and there are quite a few medieval wells that could not be built as desired because they met the Roman foundations. you can see a picture of the intermingling walls of different ages here:\n\n[http:\/\/www.museenkoeln.de\/archaeologische-zone\/default.asp?s=3029&tid=433&kontrast=&schrift=](http:\/\/www.museenkoeln.de\/archaeologische-zone\/default.asp?s=3029&tid=433&kontrast=&schrift=)\n\nI know, it is difficult to believe, but you can see Roman, Medieval and Modern walls in this picture.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1677828653.0},{"author":"Fussel2107","text":">Pardon the example, but the World Trade Center comes to mind as I lived  in lower Manhattan while the old site was being cleared and rebuilt into  1 World Trade Center. Would a future archaeologist digging in \"the  settlement mound of Manhattan\" see a \"layer\" for the pre- and post-9\/11  buildings at that site, or do modern construction techniques obliterate  prior construction so thoroughly that the pre-9\/11 site would be  invisible to a future digger? Is that a problem in other premodern sites  too?\n\nThey definitely would. Sure, they likely will not find the remnants of the twin towers and other destroyed buildings, but there will be signs that something massive happened at the site. There will be ash and dust that settle over the central park, the river, nooks and crannies and basements, that will over time solidify into a layer of dense grey probably, that will be recognizeable in the soil all over Manhattan. Depending on how thoroughly they cleaned the site, parts of the building will have embedded themselves in the ground, and gotten mixed with the earth at the new construction site. You will likely find coke cans from the 80s there and cigarette butts from the 2000s.\n\nBeyond that, you will also find a gap. All the surrounding building are of a certain age, and then you have a handful missing in a very tight area in their middle, that then got filled with new buildings all the same time. Paired with the dust layer that you'll find surrounding the site, archeologist will be able to deduce that something catastrophic and singular must have happened. They will then look at the artifacts in the ground that has been covered by that layer, and find that it holds things that were in use before 2001, and covering that dust layer will be ground holding artifacts younger than 2001.\n\n(ok, they'll probably not be that precise, but depending on the available dating material to support this, it might be surprisingly so.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't actually completely remove something. Living in an old European town, I have Roman building stones in my basement. The Roman town fell into ruins, got covered by grass and dirt, and then new people moved in and found the conveniently layed out stones already there and used them in their new buildings. But they didn't clear it all away, unless it got in their way or was useful, they would've just ignored it. Why create extra unnecessary work?\n\nMy basement is \\~ 12th century. Sturdy as they come. The stone and timber house on top of it burned down at some point in the late middle ages. So, they built a new one but reused parts of the old basement. At some point in the 20th century, someone decided they didn't want an outside basement entrance that were customary in the middle ages, so they closed that up, ripped up part of the 15th century floor inside and built a new, extremely sturdy stairwell with a mix of old and new stones into the extremely sturdy basement with a floor from the 10th century, sat on a Roman layer with some 15th century elements and a 21st century heating system built into it... and so on.\n\nRule #1 Humans are lazy.\n\nTHat sites are cleared as happened with the WTC is actually not the norm. If you have ground that contains the rubble of old buildings, you will only remove it if its in the way or you can reuse it. Depending on how much work it was to remove it and how long you expect the new house to stand, chances are, it's just too much work. Flatten it. Build on top. Screw the basement.\n\nYou have to remember, that houses in prehistory were not actually meant to stand forever. That wasn't steel reinforced concrete. It was clay and wood or unmortared stone. (Ultra important stuff excluded, but that usually has its own stratigraphy of repairs and remodels.)\n\nAll of this counts for building materials that come with a certain permanence, btw. Wooden structures are a whole nother beast. They often were built on top of each other, true, but since the material simply rots away, it's very hard (read: virtually impossible 99% of the time) to get a vertical stratigraphy. There simply isn't anything left but a few postholes and maybe signs of a hearth. Which, btw. is the reason settlement hills (tells) can be found only in certain areas and at certain times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am laughing a little at how the two German archeologists are using the exact same example.

Yes.\n\nHow much do we know? Very little.\n\nThere are three historical texts that mention Gilgamesh, one of which is only semi-historical. None of them tell us much about his reign, or provide firm dates for his reign. It falls somewhere in the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period, between 2900-2400 BCE and probably in the earlier half of that range.\n\nA short summary of those sources:\n\n1. The [Sumerian King List](https:\/\/www.livius.org\/sources\/content\/anet\/266-the-sumerian-king-list\/) is really just what it sounds like: a list of kings and very brief summaries of their deeds in ancient Sumer. It ends in the Isin-Larsa period, c. 1730 BCE, but it starts in the mythological past. The earliest kings on the list are obvious myths that supposedly lived before the Great Flood and lived for tens of thousands of years. However, several of the kings in that earliest period of the list who are given lifespans in the hundreds are mentioned in other historical texts, including Gilgamesh. He is described as the fifth king in the First Dynasty of Uruk \"whose father was a phantom, the lord of Kulaba\" and reigned for 126 years.\n2. The longest inscription referencing the historical Gilgamesh is called the [Tummal Inscription.](https:\/\/cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de\/search?layout=full&id=P469677) It actually opens by addressing Enmbaragesi, another king in the epic of Gilgamesh with similar historical evidence to Gilgamesh himself. Referring to Gilgamesh it says \"Then the Tummal fell into ruins for a second time. Gilgamesh built the Numunbura in Enlil's shrine.\" The Tummal was a temple to the god Ninlil in Nippur, and the Numunbura was an altar or annex of some sort in Enlil's temple in the same city.\n3. An [inscription](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/43076896) from a royal tomb at the city of Ur also references Gilgamesh saying: \"Gilgamesh is the one whom Utu has selected.\" This is not Gilgamesh's tomb, but possibly an official he appointed. Utu was the Sumerian sun god.\n\nThat's the whole corpus of evidence. Both of the latter two are otherwise historical sources that happen to mention names for commonly associated with myths. In the King List, Gilgamesh is surrounded by names of other semi-legendary kings, some of whom are not attested in any known documents while others are attested.","upvotes":75,"created_utc":1677797278.0}]},{"title":"[META] Can we get a Tag for answered questions?","author":"I_am_unique6435","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11fy19v\/meta_can_we_get_a_tag_for_answered_questions\/","text":"I love this sub.

The fancy folk spoke a Latin which would be more or less familiar to those back in Rome from centuries past. Out in the countryside, Gallic language had stubbornly held on but by now was all but gone, being replaced by a \"low\" form of Latin usually called \"vulgar\" Latin. It was Latin, essentially, but the Spoken Latin of the common folk which had developed, largely in parallel, with fancy Latin. \"Vulgar\" Latin is found throughout the Roman empire, and, curiously, displays some remarkable uniformity in its features regardless of the region. There were some pronunciation differences between Vulgar and \"Classical\" Latin, some vocabulary differences, and a few very minor syntactical differences. \n\nEarly in the 5th century and lasting for 70 years, Germanic tribes began to push across the Rhine into Roman territory, in an increasing numbers. By the end of this seven decades or so, a chaotic mix of Franks, Visigoths, Burgundians, Gallo-Romans, and Romans had fought each other in every conceivable combination, back and forth, some ravaging and moving on, some settling, fighting or allying with each other. By the end of it, in general terms, the Germanic speakers, within a generation or so, had ceased to speak their various Germanic dialects and had adopted, vaguely, the \"vulgar\" Latin which was so widespread in Roman Gaul. Thus in simplest terms, the Franks stopped speaking \"Frankish\" very early on, by the end of the 5th century or early into the 6th century for most of what would later be Francia. Exceptions are in Flanders and in some fringe areas beyond the Rhine. Why exactly the Germanic tribes did not impose their language on the region is a whole other question. Latin, be it literary or \"Vulgar,\" continued to enjoy a certain prestige and, probably with help from the church, maintained its hold. This does not mean that Germanic languages were forgotten, however. Frankish made a huge impact on the \"Latin\" of northern France in this time period, such that what we are really dealing with is a hybrid, perhaps more Latin than Germanic but certainly with a healthy mix of the two. This hybrid would develop and, by the 8th century at the latest, become what is now commonly called Old French.\n\nThere is a noticeable \"weakening\" of the structures of Latin in this period. Some in Rickard's lengthy explanation are across the board, some are very regional, but it is in this period, the late 5th and into the 6th century, that \"Vulgar\" Latin begins to fracture at an accelerated pace. Some of it is due to influences of new non-speaker neighbors (see below). Some of it is just the slow but accelerating divergence of this late, spoken Latin.\n\nSaid another way, the Vulgar Latin of early Francia began to change more rapidly away from its Latin origin. Rickard gives some interesting examples (see citation below): the beginning of a tendency to place an initial [i] before words beginning with [s] and followed by another consonant. So the Latin *schola* \"school\" becomes *iscola* (\u00e9cole). There is a great deal of syncope, which is the reduction of syllables (*positus* --> *postus*; *domnus* for *dominus*). Assibilation via palatisation (isn't that a fantastic term?), like *tercia* for *tertia* or *stacio* for *statio*. There is also a continued confusion about initial [h], which had already begun in the Classical period. It was clearly not prounounced except in Germanic loan-words, and in this period it starts disappearing and reappearing haphazardly: *corte(m)* for *cohortem*; and further assimilation of consonant clusters (also common in Classical), like *-nn-* for Classical -mn-. In broader terms, some of the Latin declensions begin to collapse into each other, as do some of the grammatical gender divisions. The infinitive, already pretty versatile in Classical Latin, gets superpowers and becomes much more versatile. The ubiquitous indirect statement construction, which apparently was never very popular in Vulgar Latin (TIL), is more and more replaced with hacked-in clauses using *quia* or *quod* and the indicative, almost certainly on analogy with Germanic syntax. Finally, let me quote Rickard here for some fantastic technical terms: \"Three major phonological developments which precede the appearance of the earliest [Old French] texts, and which are believed to have taken place gradually from the fifth to the early ninth century, are the final reduction of proparoxytons (a process begun earlier), the loss of final unstressed syllables, and extensive diphthongisation in stressed syllables.\" (p.13)\n\nThere were numerous Germanic colorings of the \"Vulgar\" Latin in this process, as well. Many new Germanic vocabulary items come in to the language, especially terms associated with nature (like names of trees) and the lexicon of warfare. Some Germanic grammar find their way in, like Germanic suffix *-hart* (French -ard) and *-wait* (French -aud). \n\nFor many more examples, see Peter Rickard, *A History of the French Language* (Routledge, 2003).","upvotes":71,"created_utc":1677787330.0}]},{"title":"[META] The rules and moderation practices of AskHistorians have changed over the past decade.

The form of ownership allowed to women was however not a kind of ownership we would recognize today, as the concept did not contain any individual rights of the owner to freely decide how to use what was owned. Women were legally subordinate to a husband or father, and as such no real female subjectivity could be said to have existed. Maintenance and control of property, as well as the right to decide what to do with any profits from working it, were still in the hands of men and the hierarchical social order in general. There was very little social mobility. This order was actively ideologically supported by the state church.\n\nAs in other parts of Europe, widows were probably slightly more recognizably free than other women, and due to constant wars, there were a lot of widows around. But conversely, widows were disproportionally victimized during the witch trials of the 1600s. Widows, and female actorship in general, was clearly a threat to the socal order.\n\nIt has been fairly common in Swedish political discourse to relate the emergence of the welfare state to the figure of the \"odalbonde\", the independent self-owning farmer with rights of inheritance and some political representation who was nevertheless intensely aware of his place in society. Reference to this figure has however been very common in political discourse which actively opposed social democracy, suggesting that both supporters of \"progressive egalitarianism\" and its opponents were actively trying to relate their ideologies to some specifically Swedish or Nordic mentalit\u00e9 seen as having its roots in deep history.\n\nThe origin of Swedish social democracy and its political success in the 20th century likely lie elsewhere, in conditions that emerged later. Commonly put forth factors include an early adoption of a freedom of the press, the emergence of popular movements tied to religion or social issues such as alcoholism in the 19th century, literacy rates and the kind of proletarization of the lower classes also seen elsewhere. The dominance of social democracy, as opposed to communism or conservatism, could be seen as an effect of a kind of compromise between the bourgeoisie and the social democratic party, SAP. In the 1920s and 30s, Sweden had among the highest number of workdays lost to strikes and other industrial action in the industrialized world. A consensus was formed which enabled the social democratic movement to push through egalitarian reforms at the expense of industrial action and the question of ownership of the means of production.

Boys served a variety of tasks, either for a patron or master, as in a squire-knight relationship, or might work as a cupbearer or camp steward, and by the time we see regiments of state armies, boys often served as drummers or buglers. Edward Black was just 8 when he served as the drummer for the 21st Indiana Volunteer Infantry in the American Civil War. While that's a rather extreme (and late) example, it does show that boys - even as they would have been understood at the time - were put to use in and around armies to a fairly late period.\n\nA much earlier example is the young robber knight-in-training, G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen. In his autobiography (written when he was in his late 70s), he talks about his upbringing, having been fostered by his uncle Conrad, a representative to the diet of the empire. After Conrad died, G\u00f6tz was sent to serve in the court of Margrave Friedrich von Brandenbach in a role he refers to as a *knab*, which, roughly translated, means \"varlet\" or some variety of court servant. In this role, G\u00f6tz  participated in two military campaigns: an invasion of Burgundy in 1497, and the Swiss War in 1499. G\u00f6tz says he's about 17 or 18 during the Swiss War, as he accounted for it, but very much considers himself a boy. He also got into a number of fights at court, especially among the Polish knghts in the retinue of Sophia of Poland, the margrave's wife. At one point in the Swiss War, after his horse had been killed, G\u00f6tz insinuated himself with a group of *Knechten* who were packing a tower with gunpowder to convince a group of Swiss arquebusiers to surrender. They wouldn't, and so they lit the powder. I'll let G\u00f6tz  tell it:\n\n> After my horse, on which I attended the margrave, had died, I ran as a bad boy (*b\u00f6ser Bub*) in company with the Knechten toward the church, grabbed an old spear, and had my sword, also bound onto the beard and cut off my hosen. \n\n> At last, Sir Sebald Spat and others arrived with powder, and loaded it downstairs below the steeple and lit it. Those who were inside surely burned, but a Swiss man fell from the top with a young boy cradled in his arms. After he struck the ground, the boy ran away unharmed, but the Swiss man was dead. One of the margrave\u2019s riders took the boy, but I do not know what came of him, I have not seen him since.\n\nIt's not until 1500, when G\u00f6tz was likely 20 or so, that he tells us that he was no longer a boy, and donned armor for the first time. What's interesting to me is that while G\u00f6tz undeniably participated in battles as a boy, he considers himself boyish until his early 20s, quite a bit older than we might think. Along the way, he fought in personal fights, in battles, in training, and in feuds. He uses the terms *Knab* and *Schenck* to describe his role at court, knave and cupbearer, which gives him a variety of roles attending the margrave and his sons. The margraves sons were also part of some of these campaigns, and Friedrich's son Casimir was roughly a year younger than G\u00f6tz. \n\nOtherwise, we know that boys, especially boys of the second estate, the lordly and knightly classes, would have attended knights on battlefields and in court. While their role was not necessarily in *fighting*, they would have managed the knight's property, helped the knight don armor, make sure they had food and water (it can be hard to eat and drink in armor), switch horses when they needed to, and in general just do whatever needed done so the knight could concentrate on their role. This wasn't unusual, and teen boys throughout history have always been enthusiastic participants in violence when opportunity presented. A telling line from *The History of William Marshal* (a biography-cum-chivalric romance of William Marshal, one of the most famous 12th and 13th century knights in English history) describes the squires \"'boldly leaping in the ditches and on to the ramparts!\u2019 We visualise those squires, ravenous for income, attacking in a swarm.\" The *History* also gives numerous descriptions of boys participating in the tournaments Marshal was famous for fighting in, taking the reins of captured knights and aiding their masters in whatever way was necessary.\n\nSo, in short, yes, boys would have been part of battlefields for a long, long time. It's likely only recently that the idea of a boy younger than the age of majority would be specifically prevented from participating in warfare, at least in western countries.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1677854176.0}]},{"title":"Why was Bismarck in such conflict with his parliament?","author":"Remote_Doughnut_5261","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11go76s\/why_was_bismarck_in_such_conflict_with_his\/","text":"So I was reading about Bismarck and it seems his parliament was much more liberal than he was, opposing militarization for instance.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1677809311.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

The shaman backs some young Oto teenagers \"radicalized by tv\" who think the US government intends to exploit them in the strip mines set up in their territory.\u00a0 Superman defends the law and corporate interests. Superman flies in a representative from \"Abraxis Mining of Boring Kansas\" and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to show the Oto tribal council voted in the stripe mine, despite the opinion of the young tv radicals. The shaman refuses to believe it all isn't a ploy to steal native American land, and misses \"the old ways.\" Superman and the Shaman fight. The Shaman eventually disappears in a gigantic flame wolf. The side plot is Superman screwing up romantically.\u00a0\n\nThere is a little bit more to the story than that, but that's the gist.\n\nI would assume there is some historical reality that inspired this. Wikipedia informs me that the *Otoe* are an actual tribe from the Midwest, partly in Kansas (which is the location of the story in this comic, Superman's fictional Kansan hometown). But there's probably more here, right?\n\nIn essence, the comic seems written to make the Oto and their shaman seem prone to violence, fractious within their own community, reluctant to follow the law, and foolishly unable to realize how this strip mine will benefit their own community with employment. So that inspires a few questions.\n\n**What historical events seem like the probable inspiration for the plot of this comic?**\n\n**Was there ever similar conflict over the setting up of mines in Otoe controlled lands?**\n\n**Are there similar controversies between mining companies, the American government and tribal lands in the 20th century that may have inspired this comic?**\n\n**More generally, were there specific political reasons in the 1990's (when this comic was published) to portray native Americans in the critical way this comic does?**\n\nFor me, the comic feels too specific in its references to not have a specific historical event inspiring which is more recent than the 19th century.

This is a model that's been increasingly challenged in recent decades, not least because it's an outdated view which significantly underplays the sophistication and wealth of 11th Century English government, which was one of the most structured, and indeed possibly wealthiest, in Europe. Similarly, the idea that the Norman Conquest turned England's economic and cultural focus from the North Sea to Continental Europe willingly overlooks centuries development of complex cross-channel trade networks, political alliances, royal relationships with the Papacy and well developed pilgrim routes. Even from a legal perspective, the immediate aftermath of the Conquest is marked far more by continuity than by sudden change.\n\nSo, while there were significant differences in the *de jure* modes of land tenure post-1066, the system remained *de facto* relatively similar to that which had come before. That is to say that you're right: pre-Conquest Early Medieval English society was essentially \"feudal\" in its organisation, given how nebulous \"feudalism\" actually was. The big difference post-Conquest *legally* was that all land in England was owned by the King and then essentially *leased* to his tenants-in-chief in return for service obligations, whereas pre-Conquest English landowners had - at least on paper - owned their land. In practice, however, what mostly changed was *who* owned the land. While pre-Conquest English nobles had \"owned\" their land, they nonetheless still held it in return for extensive service obligations. By the Ninth Century, the most common of these had been codified into the *Trimoda Necessitas* - the \"three necessities\" that were levied even if all other taxes or dues were waived. These three *Necessitas* were military service, specifically levying manpower for the *Fyrd*, the coastguard or watch-standers, and serving in the army if necessary; the maintenance of roads and bridges, and the construction and maintenance of fortifications and defensive infrastructure such as beacons. In this aspect, pre-Conquest land tenure is remarkably similar to supposedly \"new\" post-Conquest structures of holding land in return for military service.\n\nThe similarities are more marked when dealing with the peasantry. At the time of *Domesday Book* in 1086, roughly some 75% of listed households in England were tenant farmers (about 15% were Freemen, and about 10% were still slaves), a proportion likely not radically different from that which had existed two decades, or even a century earlier, albeit likely with a swift reduction in the number of slaves. The *Rectitudines singularum personarum* is an early 11th Century \"feudal manual\" of sorts, a guide to estate management likely produced in Bath, which suggests the outlines the various hierarchical strata within the tenanted peasantry from the wealthiest *Neates*, to the common *Kostetlan*, to the lowliest indentured swineherd.\n\nThe *Rectitudines* suggest a variety of service obligations and food rents that a tenant might be liable for in return for the use of their lord's land, in what in any other context would unfailingly be called a \"feudal\" context. A *Kostetlan's* obligations, for example:\n\n>...is according to [the customs] that stand on the estate. In some he must labour for his lord each Monday throughout the year, or for three days each week throughout the harvest. He need not pay land-tax, but it is fitting for him to have five acres [of land], more if it is the custom on the estate, but, should it be less [land then] it is too little because he must always be available to work. He pays his hearth-penny on Holy Thursday just as befits each free man, and [he must] guard his lord\u2019s land if one asks him [to], [and] guard the coast, and [work] at [maintaining] the king\u2019s animal-hedge, and at such things such as should [befit] his rank, and he should pay his church tribute at Martin\u2019s Mass.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1677857034.0}]},{"title":"How did the Empire of Japan expect USA to respond to the Pearl Harbor attack and what role did the outcome of the Russo-Japanese war play in their thought process?","author":"Metastatic_Autism","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11gr4h2\/how_did_the_empire_of_japan_expect_usa_to_respond\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677817478.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

They had zero illusions that they would be able to inflict such a heavy blow that the US would not attempt reprisal. \n\nAs far as I know from my reading, the Russo-Japanese War had no impact at all on Japanese strategic thinking with regards to Pearl Harbor. That war was fought 30 years and multiple generations of warship prior and there was an entirely new government and generation of military leadership. \n\nThere are many reasons for the attack which is outside the scope of your question, but Japanese planners envisioned a crippling strike at Pearl Harbor which would give the IJN more or less complete freedom to establish unassailable control over the western Pacific Ocean, whose resources would allow the IJN to keep up with or surpass the resources of the US once they counter attacked. \n\nInterestingly, the first part of the plan was more or less a success. The IJN went from victory to victory in the months following Pearl Harbor. However, they failed to make themselves impregnable and failed to reckon with both the material strength and fortitude of the American military, which together with the superior technology of the US as the war went on eventually allowed the USN to first dominate and then destroy the IJN.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1677827783.0}]},{"title":"Before the Columbian exchange and the introduction of chocolate to Europe\/the widespread accessibility of chocolate in Europe, do we have a record of any foods that menstruating women traditionally ate?","author":"joygentlefriends","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11g6e7x\/before_the_columbian_exchange_and_the\/","text":"I imagine that medical texts would have advice on what to eat for healthy menstruation, but I was wondering if something else had the place that chocolate has today as a common period craving.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1677773044.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

First, that the population of the British Empire was readily at its command for both *national\/governmental* purposes and *commercial* purposes, neither of which was true. Second, that having territorial sovereignty *over* resources is the equivalent to having them inexpensively available for both of those purposes. \n\nStarting with the first point, the British Empire did not have the capacity to mobilize the entire population of its empire for major crises like World War I nor for more ordinary kinds of state-driven enterprises like building infrastructure or administration for two major and somewhat contradictory reasons. The first reason was that the Empire was fundamentally and profoundly built on the maintenance of racial inequality in ways that were both acknowledged and unstated. The British Empire was unwilling to field armies where soldiers or support forces drawn from racially differentiated parts of its empire would serve as relative equals alongside each other. In non-Western colonies, it was unwilling to allow local populations to serve below the lowest rungs of administrative service. It was unwilling to allow the populations of many non-Western colonies to move freely within territories to work in commercial enterprises. In colonies where white settlers lived alongside indigenous non-white majorities, the imperial administration often suppressed the economic productivity of the indigenous population in order to favor white settlers. \n\nE.g., because of racial hierarchy, the British Empire did not have the ability to tap into the productive capacity of many of the populations that were within its sovereignty. The second point here derives from the first. Because the post-1800 empire was built on this basis, especially after 1880, for the most part, subjugated populations had little to no interest in being part of the British Empire. They had been conquered by force, often with extraordinary and unexpected force. Most economic enterprises, especially early on, relied on violent suppression of wages (or outright coercion) such that colonial subjects could supply almost no revenue to the local administration. Often, colonial subjects often tried to stay entirely outside of the command economy established by imperial rulers and their extractive enterprises precisely because they understood that their labor would be badly undervalued and would cost them any opportunity of maintaining their own households on land they were allowed to reside upon. Much of the effort of imperial administrators went into efforts to restrain or redirect possible resistance to colonial rule in order to avoid the heavy costs of military deployment or large-scale policing for the sake of maintaining control, and even with that, such force was needed fairly often. Compulsory labor to build roads, railroads, ports and other infrastructure was an expense not just on the resource side but in mobilizing and maintaining labor during such projects. \n\nThis points to the next problem, which is that having sovereignty over resources is by no means equivalent to raising state revenues from them or having them at the command of the state for its enterprises. That should be somewhat evident looking around the world: there are many governments which realize some form of rents from resource extraction on their sovereign territory but which do not really control that extraction or realize the main profit from it either directly to government or within their national economies. For the British Empire as such to realize direct state revenues from resource extraction on a large scale took encouraging the development of some form of enterprise using local labor, and there were many reasons why imperial administrators hesitated to do so. There are important exceptions--the spread of cocoa farming through West Africa happened in part because British (and French) administrators released some of their tight top-down control over land and decision-making and allowed local men to aggressively accumulate land and control labor in pursuit of cocoa production. \n\nAll of this was on the minds of late 19th Century liberal critics of British imperialism, people like J.A. Hobson, author of 1902's *Imperialism* (which was in turn influential on Lenin's *Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism*). Hobson took aim in part at the maxim \"trade follows the flag\", the idea that the British Empire needed imperial possessions in order to secure protected markets. Not just protected supplies of important raw materials, but also consumers who would preferentially buy British manufactured goods *because* they were within the Empire--a central campaign plank for the British politician Joseph Chamberlain, among others. The problem was that developing most of the imperial population as consumers also took including them as equals who earned reasonable wages for their labor, had access to education, and so on. Which was not happening. So Hobson pointed out that trade would *not* follow the flag; quite the opposite, that empire would just be an expensive impediment to economic development. The economist Joseph Schumpeter made a similar argument a bit further down the line--that imperialism was a counter-productive and expensive 'atavism' that resulted from the waning and degenerate influence of aristocrats who equated the ownership of land with the creation of wealth. Radical critics like Leonard Woolf often echoed these critiques during the interwar period.\n\nBe that as it may, the fact is that the OP's understanding of the relationship between government, revenue and wealth applies, if it at all, to *nations*\\--or perhaps to premodern empires that weren't built around racial hierarchy. There were certainly enterprises that made considerable profit operating in the British Empire, and there were a few territories that produced considerable revenue for the United Kingdom (India, most prominently), a good proportion of the empire's human and economic potential remained inaccessible because of the basis on which the empire was organized.","upvotes":30,"created_utc":1677796317.0}]},{"title":"What did the common footsoldier have on their shield in Medieval Europe?","author":"PaninicalaBacnk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11gn0ye\/what_did_the_common_footsoldier_have_on_their\/","text":"Would he have a symbol that would indicate his country?

I have a past answer [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/ix3df7\/cadet_branches_inspired_by_crusader_kings_3\/g69z3v7\/) that discusses the concept of a \"cadet branch\" that gets into this:\n\n>Unlike certain other countries, Capetian France never had a king before Louis X who didn't have a son to pass the crown to. His uncle Philippe was made regent until Louis's pregnant wife gave birth to Jean, and then decided that he should inherit the throne instead of Jean's older sister, Jeanne. He had the Estates-General declare that there was insufficient precedence for a woman to inherit, and Jeanne was allowed only the throne of Navarre. There was no problem with Charles's accession after Philippe's, but with no more Capet brothers to succeed him, it was necessary to take stronger steps. It was declared, on the basis of the old \"Salic Law\" - a law code written in the reign of Clovis I in the sixth century, which you may recognize as a really long time ago, so long ago that it's not really relevant by the fourteenth century - that women definitely had no right to a portion of the kingdom, no ability to inherit it or to pass it on to their children, which excluded Marie and Blanche.\n\n> Instead, Charles IV was succeeded by Philippe VI. Philippe IV's brother had been given titles by their royal father, the way non-heir royal children typically are, and one of them was \"Count of Valois\". This title was then inherited normally by his son, Philippe, and as a result, the branch of the family that inherited the throne became known as the Valois dynasty. Because it descends from a younger sibling of the main house, it is a cadet branch - that's all the term means.\n\n>Every time a younger brother of a French king had a major title that could be inherited by his sons, he founded a new cadet branch ... or at least, that's how we can look at it from a later viewpoint. \"Cadet branch\" is a social construct that only exists in relation to a main royal or noble house, and it's typically only relevant when an individual from a cadet branch comes to the throne. There are simply so many of them, and the people involved in them consider themselves, well, the main characters of their own story. They have their lands to manage and their politics to deal with. After a few generations, they are typically so far away from inheriting the main title that it's no longer a concern.\n\nEach younger son of Edward and Philippa technically founded their own cadet branch of the Plantagenet dynasty just by virtue of being younger sons. John of Gaunt married Blanche of Lancaster and eventually inherited the title of Earl of Lancaster, later being raised to a dukedom, and as a result, his branch became known as the House of Lancaster. If any of the other sons had been as relevant to broader English history, we likely would talk about the House of Gloucester and the House of Clarence, but, uh, we don't. If Henry IV had come to the throne in a more orderly fashion, he could possibly (though not probably) have still been considered a Plantagenet. They are just labels.\n\nSecond: Henry wasn't really Richard's \"rightful successor\"! The concept of a rightful successor is itself also a social construct, there's nothing inherently rightful about patrilineal succession, blah blah blah. How we define a rightful successor is entirely based on law and precedent, and the thing is that in a lot of medieval and early modern English history, law and precedent are crazy. Edward I had made it clear that women could inherit the crown; Edward III made it clear that the crown should skip over his granddaughter, Philippa, whose father was next in line after Richard's (John of Gaunt was the third son that survived to adulthood) and her heirs. Law and precedent could become tangled and opposed to each other. Under one principle, Philippa's heirs were next in line to the throne, and under another, John's were. Neither was inherently more legitimate unless favored by the current king.\n\nA pretty important issue here is that Henry Bolingbroke, i.e. the future Henry IV, violently rebelled against Richard II even before he deposed him, and as a result, Richard banished him and prevented him from automatically inheriting his father's dukedom - which is a pretty big statement that he was not favored to inherit. Richard in fact preferred Philippa's son, Edmund Mortimer, following the type of succession we'd consider \"normal\" in that it goes all the way down the childless king's first uncle's lines before heading to the next. As a result, Edmund revolted against Henry in turn, though he didn't succeed. Ultimately, this is why the Wars of the Roses happened - because two potential lines of succession were in conflict.","upvotes":25,"created_utc":1677779808.0},{"author":"No-Cost-2668","text":"He is a Plantagenet. But he's not a \"direct Plantagenet.\" This is similar to the Capetians and the Valois (and Bourbons). Phillippe VI of France is a Capetian, but his father Charles of Valois was the third son and Count of Valois, while the second son of Phillippe III became Philippe IV and was inherited the throne directly from his father. While Philippe IV's sons and grandson all quickly passed the throne to each other, they were all relatively close to each other, but when Charles IV died, the throne passed to the cousin line who had long established itself in Valois. Unlike every Capetian before him, Phillippe VI did not inherit from a father or brother (or 6 day old nephew), and hence wasn't in the direct line. The Capetians are also - and lesser - known as the Direct Capetians and the other lines known as Capetian-\"New House,\" such as Capetian-Burgundy, Capetian-Anjou, Capetian-Courtney, and Capetian-Valois.\n\nSo, with this in mind, the same is likely true for the Plantagenets. Unlike his cousin, Richard II, Henry IV wasn't intended to inherit England, but was instead Duke of Lancaster. The divide between him and the throne was wide enough that he was considered of a Lancastrian branch of the Plantagenets and not the main branch.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677840132.0}]},{"title":"How did japan become one of the most important countries for video games in in the 80s and 90s?","author":"Ill_Yam_3993","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11gp62a\/how_did_japan_become_one_of_the_most_important\/","text":"Nintendo was (irrc) the most popular gaming company world wide, and later during this period so was sony, other japanese dev teams also saw success during this period, despite japans relatively small population.

Did they know Vesuvius was a volcano? Probably not, in practical terms. But did they know about volcanoes in general? Absolutely. How did these two  things intersect? There's the rub!\n\nFirst: Romans of this time and place absolutely had a conception of what a volcano was. Greek mythology generally conceptualizes volcanoes as locations where giants were trapped, or as the location of a divine forge: Hesiod's Theogony (8th c. BC) has probably the earliest Greco-Roman reference to a volcano:\n\n>like tin  \n>  \n>when smiths use bellows to heat it in crucibles  \n>  \n>or like iron, the hardest substance there is,  \n>  \n>when it is softened by fire in mountain glens   \n>  \n>and melts in bright earth under Hephaistos' hands.  \n>  \n>So the earth melted into incandescent flame... (Theog. 861-866; trans Lombardo and Lamberton)\n\nIn general, Hephaistos (Vulcan, in Roman mythology) was believed to have his forge beneath Mt Etna, on Sicily, which was (from ca. 693 BC) - and still is - a constantly erupting volcano (see Chester et al 2005, 96). Other literary references are also made to volcanic activity, such as Pindar (5th c BC; about Typhon trapped beneath Mt Etna: \"he flings forth the most terrifying founts of fire...\" (Pyth. 1.25)), and Callimachus (Hymn to Apollo 4.41ff; Ares' shield produces thunder likened to an eruption of Etna) each tell us that the eruptive activity produced by volcanoes was something not only commonplace enough to not need full explication, but that was particularly associated with specific beings\/deities, and a specific place. I should note that Greek mythology and literature, in the bounds of a question about Roman culture, is perfectly fitting; literate and educated Romans of all periods consumed Greek literature in quantity, so Hesiod, Pindar, Callimachus, and many others would have been familiar to them - and for those not literate or without the leisure to read, these stories and locations would have been familiar via their permeation in Mediterranean culture. As for Roman literature, Vergil uses references to volcanoes (in the 4th Georgic (170-175), he refers to divine workers in a forge beneath Etna; in the Aeneid there are divine monsters beneath volcanoes (Enceladus beneath Etna, 3.578, and Typhon beneath Inarime on Ischia, 9.716), a recent eruption of Etna causes issues between Scylla and Charybdis (3.570ff), etc. These are only a few examples, but the point is that there were regular references to volcanic activity in some of the most enduring literature of both cultures, dating many centuries before the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.\n\nSo the concept wasn't unfamiliar, but this is a very different thing from thinking \"Mt Etna, which is far away, is where a god's forge is\" and \"that mountain in my backyard will one day kill me.\" We know, today, that not just Vesuvius, but the area around - called the Phlegrean Fields - is heavily seismic (in fact, much of eastern Italy is - the African tectonic plate shoves against the Eurasian plate in this area, creating volcanoes from as far north as Amiata in Tuscany and as far south as Sicily), and there is evidence of pre-AD 79 eruptions in both archaeology and ancient literature. In Pompeii and its environs (particularly at Nola, S. Abbondio, among others), there was Bronze Age-era settlement, dating to ca. 1800 BC (see Guzzo 2011, 11-12), which was wiped out by an eruption (though it's clear that by the time what we know of as the later city of Pompeii was settled, there were no traces and no memories of this much-earlier eruption). What became Pompeii, centuries later, appears to have had all of the advantages of the terrain that we understand come from volcanic soils - that is, extremely fertile land producing high-quality crops - along with a conical, verdant, entirely benign-appearing mountain in the background. This image, from the [domestic shrine in the House of the Centenary](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/bf\/Pompeii_-_Casa_del_Centenario_-_MAN.jpg\/1024px-Pompeii_-_Casa_del_Centenario_-_MAN.jpg) (and shown [here in situ](https:\/\/www.pompeiiinpictures.com\/pompeiiinpictures\/R9\/9%2008%2006%20house%20part%207_files\/image018.jpg), ca 1881-1882), appears to depict Vesuvius; it is covered in vineyards, and the figure to the viewer's left is likely Bacchus, as he is wearing a cloak covered in grapes. The idea is that the owner of this house likely owned some of these slopeside vineyards and relied on them for his income, so naturally he depicted the source of his livelihood in the shrine where he made his daily prayers - and gave us a picture of perfect rural harmony in the process. Contrast that picture of the pointy, normal-looking mountain with [this picture of Vesuvius today](https:\/\/img2.oastatic.com\/img2\/50476348\/600x300r\/t.jpg) and you'll get a sense of just how different it is after the AD-79 eruption - the top of the mountain quite literally blew off with the force of that particular blow. If the Centenary shrine image really does show Vesuvius as it appeared pre-79, you can see why people living in the area wouldn't have thought much about that particular landmark.\n\nBut, there is plenty of evidence that the ancients knew the broader area was volcanic, even if they didn't quite understand it as we do now. To the north of Vesuvius is an area known as the Phlegrean Fields (Campi Flegrei today), as outlined clearly in [this map.](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Map-of-the-Campi-Flegrei-caldera-Naples-Italy-The-map-modified-after-16-101016-j_fig1_342126632) It is part of a supervolcano, which is a series of calderae and  volcanic vents. This area was mythologically believed to be an access point to the underworld; famously, it is where Aeneas accesses the underworld in Book 6 of the Aeneid. Owing to the landscape, with is deep craters, broad, circular lakes, and calderae with vents and unbelievable sulfurous fumes (if it ever reopens, [Solfatara](https:\/\/media.tacdn.com\/media\/attractions-splice-spp-674x446\/0b\/39\/a7\/1c.jpg) is a stunning, evocative, and impressively odorous place to visit; it has been closed since 2017 when 3 people tragically died after falling into a fumarole), it is easy to understand why the location was considered otherworldly in antiquity. More scientifically-minded Strabo - a Greek geographer living in the late 1st c. BC into the early 1st c. AD (but unfortunately, who died ca. 50ish years before Vesuvius erupted) described the area in a way that is quite on the nose:\n\n>\"masses of rock looking like they had been eaten by fire... one might infer from this evidence that the area was previously burning and had craters of fire, which were extinguished when the fuel ran out.\"  (5.4.8)\n\n**(continued...)**","upvotes":188,"created_utc":1677732158.0}]},{"title":"was tap water priced at the beginning of 20th century?","author":"just-want-to-sign-up","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11gtbjd\/was_tap_water_priced_at_the_beginning_of_20th\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677824250.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Now, the original question is based on the slightly erroneous premise, as Russian does not have a direct counterpart to 'Motherland'. The two words that are commonly used to denote a land of one's origin, and more or less equivalent to English nouns 'Motherland' and 'Fatherland' are *\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430* (rodina), feminine, derived from the word \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 (rodit') \\[to give birth\\] and *\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e* (otyechestvo), neutral, derived from the word \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 (otyets) \\[father\\]. There is also the variant of the latter, namely *\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430* (otchizna), used more or less in the same way as 'otyechestvo'. It might be also conjectured that the word 'otyechestvo' is a derivative of *\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430* (votchina), meaning a defined, separate part of land, possibly referring to the fact that land was primarily inherited from one's father (cf. Polish word 'ojcowizna', literally meaning 'the property of a father' and being used as a synonym of a family inheritance). In Medieval Rus', 'votchina' also commonly referred to a land owned and ruled by a knyaz' (duke).\n\nIn his work *\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0435* \\[*Russian mentality in language and text*\\], Vladimir Kolesov, Soviet and Russian  linguist, notes that the word 'rodina' is primarily associated with the act of being born in a given country, and thus refers to the area one feels affinity to, that shapes their way of thinking through language, culture and surroundings and that is largely expressed in emotional terms (so, in a way, it can be compared to the English word 'homeland'). Conversely, 'otyechestvo' is a word largely associated with the formal sort of the affiliation, referring to codified laws, rules, duties, solidarity, and the idea of common membership. In a way, although the similarity is a bit tenous, it might be compared with the difference between 'country' and 'state' or between 'home' and 'house' (it is better observed in German, where 'rodina' and 'otyechestvo' can be mapped to the words 'Heimat' and 'Vaterland' respectively). Some linguists point out that the term 'rodina' is often used with the adjective 'small' when referring to an area (region, village or even a city district) when someone has been born or spent their childhood, while 'otyechestvo' is never referred in this way, stressing association of this term with formalized state identity and statewide governmental power.\n\nViktor Vinogradov, Soviet linguist and literature theoretician, noted that the in early 19th century, word 'otyechestvo' had very strong political and social connotation, especially in the texts of Decembrists and their sympathizers, likening it to the term 'patriot' that in late 18th century France that was almost a synonym for 'revolutionary' (also compare it with the name of supporters of independence of British colonies in America). It is worth noting that Paul I issued an edict to remove the word 'otyechestvo' from all official texts, replacing it with *\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e* (gosudarstvo), that in contemporary Russian is an equivalent to English word 'state'.\n\nIt is worth noting, that in military context, the expression *C\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443!* (Sluzhu otyechestvu!, lit. 'I serve the fatherland!') is a common formal response to a commendation or praise given to a soldier, like during e.g., decoration ceremony. In Soviet times this has often been replaced with 'I serve the Soviet Union!', yet practice remained.\n\nThus, stressing the term 'otyechestvo' and not 'rodina', Stalin might have attempted to underline the fact that although previously (especially in pre-revolutionary Russia), local inhabitants had their land of birth they might have felt affiliation to, but between relatively rigid class differences and lack of empowerment of the general society, at least in modern sense of this term, people, until 19th century were not free or granted with agency. This was caused by the fact, that large part of Russian society was composed of serfs with few actual personal or economic freedoms, who could not express their common responsibility for the country. In other words, using the word 'otechestvo', Stalin might wanted to convey that USSR, formed less than 10 years before this particular speech was delivered, was not only a place of birth of Soviet citizens, but their 'common thing' they could take care of together. This is corroborated by the expression 'previously we did not have a fatherland', as most Russians were bound by obligations to their feudal superiors or, by proxy, to a Monarch representing both divine and secular power, but not to the state per se. This was opposed to the state of affairs in 1931 (I assume that you're referring to Stalin's speech 'On the duties of farmers' presented on 4th February 1931, during the First All-Soviet Conference of the Workers of Socialist Industry), when the situation apparently began to stabilize after the Civil War and turmoil of mid-1920s (although Great Famine and Stalin's Purges were already waiting round a corner).\n\nAlso please note that the speech contains expressions such as 'socialist fatherland'. This basically had to be rendered as 'otyechestvo' with its all associations to political and social issues, as 'socialist homeland' would not sound properly, as it would mix two different association fields, sounding a bit like an linguistic error, giving further credit to the aforementioned theories of Kolesov and Vinogradov.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the preference of the term 'otyechestvo' rather than 'rodina' could have been, from linguistic perspective, an attempt to stress that Soviet Union is no longer just a place when Russians are born, but also a place each citizen can and should be responsible for in a republican sense of this word, thus stressing the solidarity of Soviet nation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVinogradov, V.V., *\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432* \\[History of words\\], Moscow 1999.\n\nKolesov, V.V., *\u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438* \\[Human and the world in the language of the Ancient Rus'\\], University of Leningrad Publishing, Leningrad 1986.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1678179484.0}]},{"title":"Were the Israelites in Egypt slaves or workers?","author":"Fokkzel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11g4sr9\/were_the_israelites_in_egypt_slaves_or_workers\/","text":"So i understand this may be a controversial question but it's something i just never really found a good answer for.  \nAll my life i have understood that the Israelites in Egypt were slaves.

This came partially from labor's own mistakes but also from the experience of the federal government running railroads, which had fixed one mess but created several more.\n\nSo let's go back a little bit to provide some context, since without it the events that took place between 1916 through 1920 make little sense.  Railroads and their immense impact during Reconstruction, the Gilded Age, and the beginning of the Progressive Era are a vastly complicated, top level topic that I'm not going to be addressing here save for a couple of points.  The first is that in many ways populism develops as a response to the stranglehold that railroads have on the infrastructure, political system, and overall economy in many areas of the country; even at a time where governmental action is more or less deliberately sidelined by both parties, the Interstate Commerce Commission still gets chartered in 1887.\n\nThe second is what follows over the course of the next three decades, which is a long, gradual decline of the profitability of an industry that largely refuses to adapt to the new, more regulated political environment that it is forced to comply with.  Even without the initial cooperation of the Supreme Court, eventually Congress starts taking an axe to the existing rate structure with legislation like the Hepburn and Elkins Acts.  In turn, the railroads continue to do things like overexpand, have debt ridden balance sheets thanks to takeovers and dividends, and never quite figure out business models that accept that at least in theory they're now supposed to compete on more than just setting whatever price they feel the market will bear based on where their track runs.\n\nI've compressed decades of vigorous academic economic arguments here - some of which are still ongoing, and you can get into some pretty good stuff like cartel behavior if you take a dive into the many econ PhDs that have been written on the subject - but the two most relevant financial indicators of the health of the rail industry by the time 1916 rolls around are these.  First, between 1900 and 1915, compound inflation goes up about 30% over those 15 years, but the cost of running the rails rises 50% over that time.  Second, partially thanks to the ICC gaining some teeth and the public and politicians finally being able to get revenge after two generations of gouging, freight rates per ton stay flat thanks to minimal rate increases permitted by regulators.  To make matters even worse on the revenue front, in the other part of their business, passenger revenue per mile outright declines by about 20% between 1890 and 1910.\n\nDeclining gross margins and rising costs are generally a recipe for disaster for any company.  Translating this financial analysis terminology into that suitable for public history, the net effect of all this is that the profitability of railroads basically goes kablooey over that time period.\n\nTwo things happen as a result.  First, by 1915 about a sixth of the rail network (~40k miles of about 240k total) of the United States is either bankrupt or in receivership.  Second, even the rails that are in better health have over the decades massively skimped on CapEx, capital expenditures.  This presents a major problem as while railway economics improve dramatically in 1916 - freight miles carried go up by a remarkable 1\/3rd year-over-year thanks to the war boom supplying the Allies - the infrastructure to deal with it is either antiquated, insufficient, or at times non-existent.   By November 1916 the industry was short over 100,000 rail cars even if it had been run efficiently, which it wasn't, and that structural deficit is exacerbated by a lack of enough locomotives to haul the ones they have.  Another issue becomes that given the years of insufficient building of terminal facilities, full trains would stack up at them waiting for unloading and sit for weeks or even months; close to 150,000 fully loaded rail cars or so were essentially stuck  by the end of the year.  Making it even more dire, even once unloaded, railroads frequently refused to make a run with empty freight cars back to their origination or wherever else they were needed; instead, they'd wait around for a cargo run for revenue before departing.  \n\nAnd then on top of this, thanks to the freight boom in 1916 labor realizes it can get away with playing hardball.\n\nWhile the images of management running roughshod over labor in that era come to mind with images of coal miners and factory workers working in hellish conditions, the rail worker brotherhoods involved in this - engineers, firemen, conductors, and trainmen - are actually some of the best paid labor in the country, with the most comparable modern equivalency likely being something like today's airline pilot unions.  They rather cleverly hatch on to something that's been demanded by all rail workers (and most of labor in general) for years, which is an eight hour workday.\n\nThis sounds quite reasonable on the surface, but given railroads tended to operate on ten hour shifts that couldn't easily be altered, what this proposal actually was asking for is a pretty substantial pay raise with overtime being routinely paid out after the first 8 hour shift.  Railroad management isn't acting in any better faith as many just want to outright break the unions entirely.  A strike is set for September 4th, 1916.\n\nWilson is very concerned given the disaster such an action would have on the economy, let alone on supplying the Allies; he first assigns his Secretary of Labor to mediate in early August.  That fails, so Wilson then steps in himself, bringing the two sides in separately over a week later that month, and proposes a compromise of an eight hour day without overtime; management rejects it outright, to which Wilson responds in biting fury as they leave the White House on August 21st, \"I pray God to forgive you, (as) I never can.\"\n\nWilson then takes the extraordinary step of addressing Congress in a hastily called Joint Session and asking it to take action to avert the strike.  In a rush, it passes the Adamson Act - named after William C. Adamson of Georgia, chair of the House Interstate Commerce Committee and fairly close confidant of Wilson (the following March, he's only one of two men that Wilson is known to open up to about the internal debate roiling him about asking Congress to go to war) - which starts overtime at 8 hours and puts an absolute cap at a 16 hour workday.  Labor wins round one.\n\nExcept even in a substantial victory (239-56 in the House, 43-28 in the Senate) there are warning signs.  When it reaches the Senate, the vote is mostly along party lines with even Progressive Republicans like Norris and Borah opposing it, and regular ones denouncing it as \"class legislation and a craven surrender to union threats.\"  Moreover, even on introduction it's considered controversial enough so that one of the additional powers Wilson asks for in the original draft of the bill - in the event of military necessity, to grant him the authority to take over and run the railroads - instead gets placed in a less contentious bill that gets passed around the same time, the Army Appropriations Act of 1916.\n\nThe provisions of the latter bill don't receive much if any discussion on the Presidential campaign trail, but the Adamson Act sure does.  Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes tells William Howard Taft that passing it was a \"most shameful proceeding\" and that it should be made \"a fundamental issue. I propose to press it constantly.\" He indeed does so as the single biggest domestic campaign issue of the 1916 race, calling Democrats out for special interest and class legislation.  Teddy Roosevelt weighs in too, claiming it represents \"the policy of craven surrender to whichever side has the superiority of brute force\" and Wilson having \"frank cynicism of belief in, and appeal to, what is basest in the human heart.\"  \n\nThis also convinces big business to donate far more heavily to Hughes than they did to Taft, along with making an effort to get out the vote; one supporter tells a Wilson aide, \"Before they were lukewarm, but now they are fighting mad and are offering their support to Hughes in both money and effort.\"  While the upside of this for Democrats is that it seals in the realignment of much of the labor movement to their party for 1916 and may have swung several states in the largely populist West, it is viewed as one reason why elsewhere Hughes closes the race substantially between the end of August and Election Day, with only an unintended snub of California's Hiram Johnson probably costing him the state and the election.\n\nThen comes round two.  Instead of paying the now mandated overtime, railroad management claims that the Adamson Act is unconstitutional and litigates it.  Union leaders respond by calling for yet another crippling strike set for March 19, 1917; if the 1916 strike would have been a disaster, by this point it's even worse as the United States is teetering on the very edge of declaring war. On the morning the strike is scheduled, management caves in and agrees to overtime after 8 hours - and conveniently, the Supreme Court rules later that afternoon in a 5-4 decision of *Wilson v. New* that Congress had not exceeded its authority and the Adamson Act was indeed legal, so they should have been doing so all along.\n\nAll this is obviously rather fresh on the minds of all when the United States enters the war a little over two weeks later, which since I'm pushing 10000 characters anyway here seems like it's a good place to end Part I.","upvotes":88,"created_utc":1677901583.0},{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

In a 2016 article, he writes:\n\n>In conclusion, forced deportation, sometimes resulting from warfare, and the diminishment and confinement of Indians on reservations are clear violations of current international law, but such policies also prevented genocide. Later policies of allotment and assimilation might also be condemned under current international law but contained no intent to kill Indians. While some historians would like to label such policies, or even individual attacks on Indian villages, as genocide, to do so requires an extremely liberal definition of that term. **Certainly, assessing the overall four-hundred year relationship between Indians and whites in America can lead to the conclusion  that the series of events defining that relationship meets the current legalistic definitions found in articles 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute\u2014when considered together\u2014 what is commonly called ethnic cleansing. It is a far more applicable term to define the acts and policies perpetrated on Indians. While such a definition puts these actions into a modern definitional framework, it is one that is more accurate than the blanket, catchall damnation of genocide.** Yet accepting this more recent definition should never excuse the nation from culpability when it comes to Indian policies by virtue of denying claims of systematic state-sponsored genocide.   \n>  \n>Future historians will determine the outcome of this debate. **Those who have adopted the term genocide to define crimes against Indians must admit that those crimes hardly resemble the \u201cplanned killing\u201d that went on for months and years in Turkey in 1915\u20131916, in Germany in 1939\u20131945, in Cambodia in 1975\u20131978, and in Rwanda in 1994\u20131995. Their argument must be buoyed on the revisionist definition of the 1948 Global Conference on Genocide, admittedly used by many current scholars working on topics in the Balkans, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.** Nevertheless, it should be considered that the International Criminal Court will make the final decision on what charges to bring against perpetrators of crimes in these regions of the world, where the court is very active in prosecuting criminals.

It's not just a standalone article by Anderson, but is part of a roundtable of articles on the subject by other historians.\n\nAs to specifically about Anderson's arguments: the two big flaws that jump out to me is that he indirectly equates genocide to effective extermination of a community (\"But when it comes to American Indians in the West - and even some east of the Mississippi River - nearly all the major tribes and most of their populations, as well as most minor tribes, have survived ... Certainly 'all Indian lives matter,\" yet such numbers suggest that if genocide occurred in the United States, numbers deem it far less destructive than in other places around the world\").\n\nI'm actually a little confused how he mentally works this argument since just before writing this he acknowledges the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, and Khmer Rouge Cambodia as genocides, despite those mass killings not eliminating the targeted communities. But in the case of American Indians he seems to shift the goalposts and assume that if a group wasn't completely wiped out, it wasn't genocide, and there being substantial Native populations in the US today somehow makes their situation better than in other genocides.\n\nSecond, he seems to be treating \"American Indians\" as a whole group, rather than a label that white colonists and the US government have used to describe several hundred different native nations. As a result he treats mass killings as individual unrelated events against a monolithic whole: \"In reality, most attacks on Indians led to 300 or fewer casualties and were isolated attacks, not linked together as an attack on a group. In other words, they were not part of a concerted effort to destroy all Indians.\"\n\nNotice where his argument falls apart pretty quickly. If you treat the native communities as, well, separate communities, then *yes* these mass killings would be genocide. For instance, Anderson mentions in that paragraph the Sand Creek Massacre. It was part of a campaign directed specifically at the Cheyenne and Arapaho, a campaign that was similar to many others against other native groups, but not *explicitly* part of some broader national campaign against all Native people equally. Of course, the US forces were operating under orders to \"kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found\", and the territorial governor of Colorado issuing a proclamation urging white Coloradans to \u201ckill and destroy all\u2026hostile Indians [ie, any native people not voluntarily surrendering and locating themselves to the Sand Creek reservation].\" If you look at this in terms of the Cheyenne specifically, or Colorado native peoples more generally, it seems pretty genocidal. The fact that it wasn't a coordinated campaign also against, say, native communities in Maine or California seems to be a little besides the point. \n\nEven on Anderson's own terms, he seems to not address boarding schools at all - which (as the macro notes) would seem to be a clear instance of intentional genocide. \n\nMostly I'd say that Anderson seems to be very big on sticking to ethnic cleansing\/crimes against humanity over genocide. But he has to kind of keep changing his definitional requirements to avoid \"genocide\" - it needs to be explicitly intentional, but when we have evidence of this it needs to be part of a coordinated policy against all Indians, but when we have evidence that it was at least in regional terms (as in the case of California during the Gold Rush), the fact that in that case it was often carried out by miners and not state or military authorities, that many deaths were from disease, and that initial native populations there were (in his estimation and at odds with other historians) lower than originally thought means that it also doesn't count as genocide. For some reason. \n\nAs some of the respondents in other articles in the journal note, in some ways this is all a very legalistic debate that Anderson is having, as in literally under what international statute you could define certain crimes against Native peoples, which tends to make abstract or outright ignore the massive trauma, suffering and death that different Native communities experienced.","upvotes":20,"created_utc":1677862031.0},{"author":"EdHistory101","text":"Hello. Questions about the American Indian Genocide(s) that occurred in the Americas frequently appear in AskHistorians. This topic is often controversial and can lead to inaccurate information. This message is not intended to provide you with all of the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as genocide denialism in this regard, and provide a short list of introductory reading. Because this topic covers a large area of study, the actions of the United States will be highlighted. There is always more that can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point for you. \n\n##What is Genocide?\n\nSince the conceptualization of the act of genocide, scholars have developed a variety of frameworks to evaluate instances that may be considered genocide. One of the more common frameworks is the definition and criteria implemented by the United Nations. The term \"genocide,\" as coined by Raphael Lemkin in 1943, [was defined by the U.N. in 1948](https:\/\/redd.it\/6mg3j3). The use of this term was further elaborated by [the genocide convention.](https:\/\/treaties.un.org\/doc\/Publication\/UNTS\/Volume%2078\/volume-78-I-1021-English.pdf)\n\nArticle II describes two elements of the crime of genocide:\n\n1. The mental element, meaning the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such\", and\n2. The physical element which includes five acts described in sections a, b, c, d and e. A crime must include both elements to be called \"genocide.\"\n\nArticle II: In the present convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:\n\n* (a) Killing members of the group;\n* (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n* (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n* (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n* (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\n##American Indian Genocides \u2013 Did they happen?\n\nSince the arrival of Europeans to the Americas, typically signaled with the appearance of Columbus in 1492, Indigenous Peoples have experienced systematic oppression and extermination at the hands of colonial powers. These colonizing governments either organized or sponsored acts of genocide perpetrated by settlers, targeting Indigenous settlements for complete destruction; eliminating sources of food and access to life-sustaining resources; instituting child separation policies; and forcefully relocating Indigenous populations to often times inhospitable tracts of land, now known as \u201creservations.\u201d All of these acts constitute what scholars now recognize as genocide. The horrendous acts that occurred in the Americas were even an example proposed by Lemkin himself, where it is noted from his writings:\n\n>[Lemkin applied the term to a wide range of cases including many involving European colonial projects in Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and the Americas. A recent investigation of an unfinished manuscript for a global history of genocide Lemkin was writing in the late 1940s and early 1950s reveals an expansive view of what Lemkin termed a \u201cSpanish colonial genocide.\u201d He never began work on a projected chapter on \u201cThe Indians of North America,\u201d though his notes indicate that he was researching Indian removal, treaties, the California gold rush, and the Plains wars.](https:\/\/oxfordre.com\/americanhistory\/view\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780199329175.001.0001\/acrefore-9780199329175-e-3)\n\nThese actions took place over the entirety of the Americas, exacerbating the rapid depopulation of Indigenous Nations and communities. Exact figures of the population decline are inconclusive, giving us only estimates at best, with Pre-Columbian population numbers ranging anywhere from as low as 8 million to as high as ~100 million inhabitants across North, Central, and South America. What we do know is that in the United States, records indicate the American Indian population had dropped to approximately 250,000 by 1900. Despite any debate about population statistics, the historical records and narratives conclude that, at least according to the U.N. definition, genocide was committed.\n\n##Mental Element: Establishing Intent\n\nIn order for genocide to be committed, there must be reasonable evidence to establish an intent to commit what constitutes genocide. Through both word and action, we can see that colonial powers, such as the United States, did intend at times to exterminate American Indian populations, often with public support. Government officials, journalists, scholars, and public figures echoed societal sentiments regarding their desire to destroy Indians, either in reference to specific groups or the whole race.\n\n>\u201dThis unfortunate race, whom we had been taking so much pains to save and to civilize, have by their unexpected desertion and ferocious barbarities justified extermination and now await our decision on their fate.\u201d\n\n[--Thomas Jefferson, 1813]( https:\/\/www.loc.gov\/resource\/mtj1.047_0147_0150\/?sp=3)\n\n>\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected.\"\n\n[--California Governor Peter Burnett, 1851](http:\/\/governors.library.ca.gov\/addresses\/s_01-Burnett2.html)\n\n>\". . .these Indians will in the end be exterminated. They must soon be crushed - they will be exterminated before the onward march of the white man.\"\n\n[--U.S. Senator John Weller, 1852, page 17, citation 92](http:\/\/digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=2654&context=tlr)\n\n##Physical Element: Acting with Purpose\n\n**U.S. Army Policy of Killing Buffalo (Criterion C)**\n\n[In this post,](https:\/\/redd.it\/4j42ag) it is explained how it was the intention and policy of the U.S. Army to kill the buffalo of America off in an attempt to subdue, and even exterminate, the Plains Indians.\n\n**Sterilization (Criterion D)**\n\nThe Indian Health Service (IHS) is a federally run service for American Indians and Alaska Natives. It is responsible for providing proper health care for American Indians as established via the treaties and trust relationship between tribes and the U.S. Government. However, on November 6, 1976, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released the results of an investigation that concluded that [between 1973 and 1976, IHS performed 3,406 sterilizations on Native American women.](https:\/\/cbhd.org\/content\/forced-sterilization-native-americans-late-twentieth-century-physician-cooperation-national-) Per capita, this figure would be equivalent to sterilizing 452,000 non-Native American women. Many of these sterilizations were conducted without the consent of the women being sterilized or under coercion.\n\n**Boarding Schools (Criterion E)**\n\nThe systematic removal of Indian children from their parents and placement into boarding schools was a policy implemented by the United States meant to [force American Indian children to assimilate into American culture,]( https:\/\/redd.it\/8zgozt) thus \u201c[killing] the Indian, [and saving] the man.\u201d These schools were operated by various entities, including the federal government and church\/missionary organizations. While constituting cultural genocide as well, American Indian children were beaten, neglected, and barred from practicing their cultures. Some children even died at these schools.\n\n##But What About the Diseases?\n\nIn the United States, a subtle state of denial exists regarding portions of this country's history. One of the biggest issues concerning the colonization of the Americas is whether or not this genocide was committed by the incoming colonists. And while the finer points of this subject are still being discussed, few academics would deny that acts of genocide were committed. However, there are those who vehemently attempt to refute conclusions made by experts and assert that no genocide occurred. These [\u201cmethods of denialism\u201d](https:\/\/redd.it\/6kywre) are important to recognize to avoid being manipulated by those who would see the historical narratives change for the worse.\n\nOne of the primary methods of denial is the over severity of diseases introduced into the Americas after the arrival of the colonizers, effectively turning these diseases into ethopoeic scapegoats responsible for the deaths of Indigenous Peoples. While it is true that disease was a huge component of the depopulation of the Americas, often resulting in up to a 95% mortality rate for many communities and meaning *some* communities endured more deaths from disease, these effects were greatly exacerbated by actions of colonization.\n\n##Further Reading\n\nThough there is much information about this topic, this introductory list of books and resources provide ample evidence to attest the information presented here:\n\n* [*Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America* edited by Catherine Cameron, Paul Kelton, and Alan Swedlund](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/Beyond_Germs.html?id=yUw-rgEACAAJ)\n* [*American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492* by Russell Thornton](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/American_Indian_Holocaust_and_Survival.html?id=9iQYSQ9y60MC)\n* [*Murder State: California's Native American Genocide, 1846-1873* by Brendan Lindsay](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/Murder_State.html?id=TfiD-E7VBKYC)\n* [*Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur* by Ben Kiernan](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/Blood_and_Soil.html?id=XR91bs70jukC)\n* [*American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World* by David Stannard](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/American_Holocaust.html?id=RzFsODcGjfcC)\n* [*Myths of Conquest*](https:\/\/redd.it\/2vf565) by \/u\/anthropology_nerd\n* [AskHistorians FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/nativeamerican#wiki_european_contact_and_conquest)","upvotes":15,"created_utc":1677851767.0}]},{"title":"How common was sex between consenting adult cis men in the ancient world, not just ancient greece? Was it accepted anywhere?","author":"Final_Bookkeeper_862","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11grmu6\/how_common_was_sex_between_consenting_adult_cis\/","text":"I was doing research on Greek sexuality. Mainly because I'm bi and have always thought that Greece and Rome were places where male bisexuality was the norm. I know pederasty was the dominant form of same-sex activity but I had heard of stuff like the affairs of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, and the Sacred Band of Thebes. I knew that in most places tops were respected and bottoms weren't. But I thought places like Thebes were the exception. Therefore my bisexuality is valid and has always existed. Then I found some papers by a former University of Austin professor Thomas K Hubbard.\n\nHere are the papers in question.\n\n[https:\/\/bmcr.brynmawr.edu\/2003\/2003.09.22\/](https:\/\/bmcr.brynmawr.edu\/2003\/2003.09.22\/)\n\n[https:\/\/lists.h-net.org\/cgi-bin\/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx;list=H-Histsex;month=0902;week=b;msg=Ug%2BYuljwHAbsmjyw%2BhMXhQ](https:\/\/lists.h-net.org\/cgi-bin\/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx;list=H-Histsex;month=0902;week=b;msg=Ug%2BYuljwHAbsmjyw%2BhMXhQ)\n\nSo he denies the Sacred Band of Thebes ever existed, despite the consensus of most historians being that they did exist and were lovers. The only relationships between adult men he brings up are some drunk guys on pottery and Aristotle describing men who continued being bottoms for other men even in adulthood, but only after being introduced to it in their teen years through pederasty. But he still seems hellbent on denying every other incident of sex between adult men. Why is that? Does he seriously think that gay and bisexual adult men who only want to sleep with adult men are a modern invention? \n\nHe seems to believe that sexuality is \"socially constructed\" and evolves. But scientists, in particular psychologists, generally believe that it's a complex interplay between genes, biology, and environmental factors and is thus not a choice. I know most people who believe in the social construction of sexuality also don't believe it's a choice. Because who would choose to face the homophobia and bigotry one faces as a queer person? \n\nI hope he doesn\u2019t think sexuality when it comes to attraction between adults is a choice. I hope he isn\u2019t homophobic. But how much he complains about \"gay marriage fetishists\" and \"gay apologists,\" I'm not quite sure he isn\u2019t homophobic. But then again he wrote an article on prison sex for the Gay & Lesbian Review, so he might be an ally which would be great! Maybe his point is that sex between adult cis men wasn't always accepted by society. I don't know.\n\nAlso I googled this guy, turns out he advocates for pederasty in the modern day ([https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/students-want-thomas-hubbard-fired-for-work-on-pederasty-but-university-of-texas-says-its-protected-speech](https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/students-want-thomas-hubbard-fired-for-work-on-pederasty-but-university-of-texas-says-its-protected-speech)) so I really shouldn\u2019t care what he thinks about consentual sexuality. Even if my consentual adult-adult bisexuality isn\u2019t valid (which it is valid and has always existed), at least it isn't taking advantage of teen boys.\n\nBut how common was sex between consenting adult cis men in the ancient world, not just ancient greece? Was it accepted anywhere? Were the Sacred Band of Thebes real and lovers?

I'm more familiar with early firearms history and won't pretend I'm also up on all the sources for this subject. But I think I can answer this basic question.\n\nAfter the landmark Gun Control Act of 1968 there was an interest in following it with other legislation that would regulate in specific areas that promised to reduce violent crime, like having a minimum age for possession of a firearm or barring convicted felons from firearms ownership. Banning \"Saturday Night Specials\" also seemed as though it would be useful: intuitively, throwaway guns would by their nature just seem to enable crime and violence. In the 1970's there were, therefore, many bills proposed; at least 19, from 1969 to 1979. They failed. Initially, because it was hard to carefully identify the target. Trying to call the guns  \" firearms without a legitimate purpose\" to differentiate them from sporting firearms didn't go far, because the 1968 Act accepted self-defense as a legitimate use of a firearm. Then there was an effort to define a \"Saturday Night Special\": but that became, under examination, quite hard to pin down. Price , size, quality, concealability and reliability were each not enough: it was hard to define how low \"cheap\" should be, and it seemed to imply unsafe, unreliable and low-quality- but there did not seem to be, actually,  many unsafe guns- so, a law banning them would then have no effect on crime.  And at what point was a pistol too big to conceal? And in what kind of clothes? Some pretty elaborate systems were proposed that awarded points for many factors like barrel length, caliber, how many safeties were on the pistol that would prevent it firing accidentally, etc. But upon examination, when they were applied these point systems included far too many handguns,  effectively banning about 54% of all pistols manufactured or sold in the US; some of which were even in use by police departments.\n\nTaking notice of this was the NRA. In the mid 70's NRA executives decided to move its headquarters from Washington DC to New Mexico and focus less on politics, more on shooting sports; and so the Suicide Special legislation got less attention from them. But in 1977 at the annual meeting in Cincinnati there was what's been called a coup: the Life Members revolted, and firmly endorsed the organization as being primarily a political one. New executive leadership kept the political focus and the DC headquarters. With a re-politicized NRA, soon not only did Congress have difficulty identifying what a Saturday Night Special was but also had to deal with greater NRA hostility and ( with their activism) public hostility towards any gun legislation. Not long after that was the election of Ronald Reagan.  Efforts to extend the 1968 Gun Control Act to ban Saturday Night Specials never went further.\n\nCook, P. (1981).

This tactic seems to be pretty effective at beating even superior cavalry forces. The biggest example that comes to my mind is the Battle of Gaugamela, where Alexander used his light troops and foot companions to contend with the heavily armoured and more numerous Persian cavalry opposing his flank.\n\nBattle of Pharsalus is another example, where Caesar baited the more numerous Pompeian cavalry to his hidden spearmen and those forces together routed the Pompeians.\n\nDe Re Militari has a line about this as well:\n\n\"If your cavalry is not equal to the enemy's it is proper, after the ancient custom, to intermingle it with light infantry armed with small shields and trained to this kind of service. By observing this method, even though the flower of the enemy's cavalry should attack you, they will never be able to cope with this mixed disposition.\"\n\nSo I'm curious why this wasn't a common tactic, seeing that it's pretty effective at countering superior cavalry forces, provided they can be baited. The usual tactic seems to be cavalry at the wings, and letting them charge the enemy cavalry while infantry fought each other, and whichever cavalry wins can encircle the infantry. In medieval battles such dispositions are even rarer, where it seems to have infantry blocks acting static while knights charged each other again and again, retreating to the infantry to regroup. \n\nMany times in both ages armies would meet enemy cavalry charges with their own cavalry, not trying to get some infantry into the deal to tip the scales, which seems dumb to me...\n\nThough past the age of swords and spears, I think Napoleon also had a quote about the power of infantry and cavalry attacking together, but I can't remember it exactly...","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1677773647.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.

Originally this was usually labor but in many cases had been converted to money payments. Copyhold was so called because the lord held kept the actual record of ownership in his court and gave the tenant a copy. Copyhold was considered an unfree form of land tenure (as opposed to freehold) and much more like renting than owning land. Notably, copyholders could not sell their interests in land. Rather they had to surrender their interests to the lord, who then conveyed them to a new copyholder. Thus copyholders were not considered landowners. \n\nCopyhold tenure was not abolished until 1925.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677821031.0}]},{"title":"Thursday Reading & Recommendations | March 02, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11g3h8o\/thursday_reading_recommendations_march_02_2023\/","text":"[Previous weeks!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/search?q=Thursday+Reading+%26+Research&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nThursday Reading and Recommendations is intended as bookish free-for-all, for the discussion and recommendation of all books historical, or tangentially so.

Increased anti-war sentiment in the aftermath of the Great War is not a surprising development, I'd say.

I was listening to a \"Great Courses\" lecture recently and the presenter made a pretty dramatic case that it's difficult to identify who the founding fathers really are?  \n\nFor instance:\n\n* All signers of the Declaration of Independence didn't necessarily sign the Constitution.\n* The progenitors of the Articles of Confederation weren't all involved in the formation of the subsequent US Constitution.\n* John Jay - to name only one -- did not sign the Declaration or the Constitution, but had a dramatic impact on the founding if the United States\n* Are legislators who ratified the Constitution at the state level considered founding fathers? \n\nAnd so on....\n\nIt seems to me that we pick selectively who a founding father is depending on the particular point we're trying to make.  My own view is the concept now has become so amorphous that legal, historic and general conversations that invoke the notion of founding fathers are clouding the issue they are trying to make. \n\nNOTE: I make a distinction here between 'Founders' and 'Framers' where a framer is a signatory to the final US Constitution.","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1677792062.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Welcome to \/r\/AskHistorians. **Please [Read Our Rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/wiki\/rules) before you comment in this community**.
