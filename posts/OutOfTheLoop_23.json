Lots of subjunctive mood (\"This  planet would be known as Tau Volantis\"), lots of extra unnecessary  wording (\"They reproduce by dividing themselves much in a similar way to  that of amoebas\") and such.  Example channels include WesHammer and  Roanoke Gaming.\n\nI'd been writing  it off as one content creator's writing quirks until I noticed similar  things in several channels that are, so far as I can tell, unrelated.   What gives?\n\n\\*Yes, I know that  language is descriptive and not prescriptive, and that as long as the  communicator is making themself understood it's correct in use.  That said, a  lot of these clash with the rules of grammar as it's generally taught.",

But I have a basic awareness of the following points:\n\n* A few years ago they assembled a superstar team with Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Kevin Durant. \n* As of this week, [none of the above remain on the team](https://www.nba.com/news/suns-nets-kevin-durant-trade). Yet they are still in a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n* At some point they hired and later fired Steve Nash as their head coach\n\nBesides for those points, I'm vaguely aware there has been a ton of drama around the team and the players, but assume I have zero knowledge of specifics. \n\nIf someone can please paint the saga from when they assembled this version of the team until the implosion, I would really appreciate and enjoy that.",
