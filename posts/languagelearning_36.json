But I've been exposed to English, since infancy basically, by my parents. I learnt to read and write English even before my \"mother tongue\". All my schooling, and a lot of my entertainment options, have been in English. However, on the records, I wouldn't be considered a \"native English speaker\". I'd still have to give an IELTS or TOEFL exam to go live abroad. Which makes me wonder, what exactly makes someone a native speaker? In my opinion, growing up surrounded by media in that language, and using it in conversations pretty much all your life should technically qualify you. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.\n\nApologies if this doesn't make sense. I have a presentation due tomorrow, I'm nowhere near done and my caffeinated brain will do anything except work. I'm sure we've all been there.\n\nAlso how do you guys get the little subtitles under your usernames that show which all languages you're learning I want that too",

She has asked if we can provide them with a TV where they can (more or less) freely watch cartoons and children's programming, but only in Spanish. \n\nWe are in the United States and are not a Spanish-speaking household, although the kids went to a Spanish immersion pre-K and Kindergarten and my wife-a truly gifted language-learner and five-language polyglot-is learning Spanish herself. While there are countless hours of Spanish-language children's entertainment available to us, we don't have the time or energy to force them to watch it, and the kids will never choose Spanish content on their own. Frankly, the kids are not internally motivated to learn Spanish. But the hope is that they will voluntarily watch Spanish-language cartoons/entertainment after they have used up their free time on their tablets.  \n\nComplicating things- neither of us have owned a proper TV for about 20 years.  Whole generations of technology have passed us by while we watched streaming content on laptops, so I know very little about age restricting content.\n\n(a) Is this technologically feasible? How would one go about providing free access to a couple of choices of only Spanish-language entertainment?  Would you get a TV and a cable subscription, and lock everything but Spanish-kids-programming? Change the audio language to Spanish and somehow lock that? \n\n(b) Can I link a TV to streaming content, but lock the language onto Spanish, and only let them see and choose programs that have Spanish audio?\n\n(c) Has anyone tried something like this with their own kids?

        "text": "Hi everyone! I want to learn a third language, but I don't know which ones to consider. I'd love your input. \n\nI am looking for a language with a lot of interesting words with meanings I have not considered. What I mean by that is, consider the English words related to the concept of happiness. Bliss, joy, contentment, peace... I like to ponder words like this. I find it fulfilling to think about what they mean, their similarities and differences, and where I am in my own life and my own happiness. But my native language (Swedish) has a few words related to happiness that don't have a good translation in English. So it only goes to show, that there are many other languages out there, that have words I'd love to ponder that don't have a counterpart in any language I have learned. Concepts I haven't even heard about, amazing treasure troves of thoughts that I haven't even skimmed over in passing. Things that I'd love to immerse myself in if only I knew that they existed. \n\nSo I'm looking for a language with a lot of words of that sort. One with a lot of emotional and spiritual nuance, in a lack of better words. \n\nOther things I'm looking for: \n\n1) It must be a language that isn't controversal for me to learn as an outsider\n\n2) Preferably, a language with learning resources I can access online\n\n3) A language that has an internal logic that makes it easy to follow the etymology of words. Like, in Swedish, you've got words like ande (spirit), andas (to breathe, but also the verb form of ande), andedräkt ('the breath', but more literally 'that which the breath/spirit wears') and this whole family of words is etymologically related to the name of the god Odin and to words associated with fate, and if you're so inclined you can follow this whole thing down the Norse sagas in a mythological rabbit hole of spiritual concepts now largely lost to time. I love stuff like this. In English, the words breath and spirit similarly *means* the same thing, but you can't really tell at a glance, because 'spirit' is loaned from Latin and the words sound totally different. It's like at some point, the priest class and upper class just decided to gatekeep spirituality from the masses by using their fancy Latin education to keep everyone else out. I'd like to study a language where this kind of things are made obvious, where people are meant to take notice. Languages meant to make people ponder and make connections and learn things. \n\nI'm considering Sanskrit, but a living language would also be very good to learn. Which languages do you know of that you think would interest me? I don't mind learning very niche languages if I think they sound interesting.",

You don't have to like everything I like, and I've been guilty of doing similar things which is why I've been trying to hold back a little on it.

It just seems so disproportionately negative than any other language.

I could blame this reputation at colonization/imperialism and past wars from its country of origin but ehm, I could say the same about lots of countries. Why is English often looked at favorably when Britain and the US did lots of similar stuff? What about Spanish and Portuguese from Spain and Portugal respectively?

        "text": "I read novels that seem interesting to me, and I think it's amazing to a point that I can't believe I can learn a new language and having such a good fun at the same time.\nBut the problem is,  in novels, there are usually many descriptive/professional/advanced words that are not common in real life conversations. But it's also true that knowing more of these kinds of words are what make you distinguish from intermediate to advanced, and most importantly, they help immensely to describe things more accurately and even poetically.  So, they are somewhat, if not the most, necessary to learn.\nHowever, if you look up every new words when you read, it's probably gonna fade away soon after and it also disrupts you from the smooth enjoyment of reading.\nSo I am kinda having a dilemma here.\nWhat are your opinions?\nHow do you normally read books in your target language?\nI usually look up every new word in the beginning and after a while, when I am tired or I am too engaged in the story to be bothered I just skip and read along as far as I can understand what happened.",

        "text": "I've passed Goethe-Institut's C2 exam after just 2 years of studying German from 0. 4 years later I've lived in Germany, studied in Germany in German, married a German, made friends with Germans and worked in Germany in German. I'd say I'm C1 at best, more likely strong B2.\n\nWhen approaching the exam in 2018 I knew there was no way I was near C2, I'd just passed C1 in English a few years prior and my English was way better than my German (probably still is tbh). I just knew I had to pass the C2 exam to be accepted into my university of choice in a work-and-study program in Germany and the exam looked doable. The reading and listenign parts of it were easy even back then when I was around most likely around B1. For the speaking and writing parts I spent a few months practicing mock exams and learning useful phrases. On the day of the exam I just said/wrote everything that came to my mind on the topics I was given and hoped for the best. I got around 75% in writing, over 90% in listening and reading and somehow 100% in speaking.\n\nThen I got to Germany and I could just make my way through a flat share hunt and opening a bank account. On the first day of university I could barely follow the lectures and on breaks I had literally no idea what anyone besides other foreigners were saying. At work I had to ask clarifying questions in English for the first months. It improved over time. I spent a whole year practicing writing in German with a tutor, while reading tons of books in German to be able to write my thesis and the first feedback I got from the prof was to maybe let my husband proof-read it for language first to save everyone's time. To this day I sometimes don't understand the jokes my colleages make, have trouble following what people from other regions of Germany say when I first meet them, I have to sometimes use English for a technical term at work and am absolutely helpless when talking to my nephews. And I've spent 4 years intensely improving my skills from the time I passed the C2 exam. It really makes it difficult for me to estimate my level in German.\n\nIs this a common phenomenon? Are the exams too easy? Are they just easy to \"cheat\" on? Is it just Goethe-Intitut and other CEFR exams are better?",

        "text": "Hello. This is something I have wondered about frequently.\n\nNative speakers are surrounded by their language(s) since they are a toddler. They are passively (and also obviously actively, once they learn how to speak) learning their language for pretty much 24 hours a day, 365 days in a year. They are drowning in it. And so, they are able to speak it fluently even without any in-depth understanding of the grammar, history, evolution etc. of their language. I mean, it would be hard for it to be otherwise, when the language has basically been **hammered** into their brains.\n\nBy my calculations, a 13-year-old native speaker will have had about 100.000 hours of immersion in their language.\n\nAs an example, Polish is a notably difficult language with complicated declension and conjugation models. I speak it fluently not because I am a genius, but because it has been drilled into my brain since I was a little kid. If I had to learn it without any previous exposure, my brain would melt.\n\nSo what I am getting at is, as a teenager or adult, you have your responsibilities, other hobbies etc. that make replicating the native speaker experience close to impossible. In most cases, it's close to impossible to reach 100.000 hours of pure immersion, and that's just a 13-year-old's level.\n\nSo when learning another language, one must always keep in mind they are probably always going to be inferior to native speakers. In most cases, a native speaker is always going to trash a C2 speaker.\n\nI wonder, does learning foreign languages even make sense, since we know we are always going to be inferior to natives?\n\nI am eager to hear your thoughts.\n\nI am sorry if all this seems incoherent, I am kind of exhausted.",

        "author": "Sensitive-Ticket-781",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/108iymh/hellotalk_is_destroying_my_motivation_to_learn/",
        "text": " I'm sure I must be the first person making a post like this, but please bear with me I'll explain everything in a bit. \n\nI (24 M) had been depressed for about the first half of 2022 due to relationship problems. I went through sooo many negative feelings. When everything was over,  I managed to get some mental rest, and then all of sudden anime came magically into my life. At first I didn't really take it seriously but to cut a long story short, not only did it get me out of my depression but it also gave me unbelievable motivation to get on with my life. Needless to say, my urge to learn Japanese was unmistakable. I got Duolingo, Genki, Kanji Study, Anki and I went at it with everything I had. My only reason for learning Japanese was pure motivation and I even had a solid goal of passing JLPT N4 in December 2023. I enjoyed every single minute of studying Japanese, and now I'm almost N5 level after studying for only 4 months.  \n\nUntil I got started on that HelloTalk app... Disclaimer, this is not to say HelloTalk is not a good app. It is one of the best apps for language exchange and I myself used it 3 years ago for my French (though I was already almost proficient in the language) and it helped me get a lot better. However, I think that in my particular case it has been counter productive with Japanese to say the least. Here's why.  For starters, not even having 100% completed N5 myself, I think it's fair to say that I rushed wayyy too much to get myself out there to chat with native people. I should have waited until I got a better grasp of vocabulary and especially grammar. It is thanks to Google translate that I manage to get by with most of my conversations in Japanese (by filtering stuff of course). But that's not even the problem.   \n\nThe problem part is that by talking with Japanese people I want so bad to be there and live it up in Japan. And I know that I can't go to Japan to meet them anytime soon, not even as a tourist. And even though I knew that right from the start and it didn't stop me from learning Japanese, interacting with all those people made me long for more... that I can't have. As a result, my motivation is going downhill and I have even started to have tendencies to roll back to my depression. At this point I'm even questioning whether I should be learning Japanese at all. I do find learning the language enjoyable, more than any other I have learned but after a certain point it just feels like building myself a pair of gorgeous wings but never actually getting to fly with them.  \n\nThe worst part is that I have been ghosted by a couple of girls after having talked with them for a solid month. That really was the final fatal blow, because I find it nearly impossible to form any form of friendship with Japanese people from such an app. I know every Japanese person is different as an individual and that I should not generalize, but the blunt truth is this. I had an immense source of motivation and I destroyed it all on my own by downloading a damn app.  \n\nMaybe I shouldn't have started using this app. Maybe I would have been better off just staying in that anime bubble. At least I would have managed to keep my motivation intact. Or maybe I'm just being paranoid... I don't know anymore. I'm just looking sooo bad for a way to get my motivation back on track. \n\nSorry if the post is too long, I just needed to sit down and write all this. I know all of this probably doesn't even make sense to most of you but it's just the way I feel. If anyone has any experience that is even remotely close to mine I would love to have any feedback. Thank you all in advance!",

Since my shorts mostly consist of videos from English speakers, I was prepared to listen to it in English, but then quickly realized it was my native language and continued listening to the video with no issues. It really felt like I switched between listening modes\n\nSo my question is, has anyone had the same experience? Is it some sort of a phenomenon that has a name?\n\nTo clarify, I do not struggle with listening comprehension in English unless they have a crazy accent you don't hear very often, it takes zero efforts. So it's probably not from being a beginner and having to focus on what's being said in the video",

        "text": "Hi! (French: Native, English: B2/C1, Italian: A2/B1 Some notions of Spanish and Esperanto). \n\n(I am learning Italian and improving my English. I also teach French as a Foreign Language. I am interested in language learning and didactics of Languages). \n\nI have an impression about language learning and I don't know if it is shared. When I go on *Italki,* positivity is one of the rules that a teacher has to respect. More generally, I have the impression (based on my experience) that when a beginner/an intermediate person learns a language, the classes will focus on positive aspects of life: food, travel, family... What I understand because it is more motivating. At more advanced levels the learner talks about problems: economy, environment, social problems... So I say as a joke that when a learner talks about problems, that means they have an advanced level. It is a simple statement.\n\nBut a polyglot friend who is learning rare languages in a language university doesn't share my feeling. For him it is a cultural element. In languages of East Europe (that he learns) talking about problems even at a beginner level is common. \n\nSo what do you think about positivity in language learning? Do you agree with my statement?",

I have a buddy who has studied a languages from several major language families, and he swears that Arabic is the most gate-kept language ever. Obviously this is all opinion based, but just curious to see what you all think. \n\nFor example, I also think Arabic has been way overestimated in terms of difficulty for a seasoned speaker of Indo-European languages. Sure, the script is different and the phonology is definitely Semitic, but having studied it on and off for a while, it seemed like it didn't take me very long at all to be able to hold a basic conversation with a native speaker.\n\nWhat is that language for you guys?",

My learning style is seeing it, hearing it, and writing it 10x. Translators like on Bing don’t always line up with the sentences I’m trying to see/translate from Audible.  Most apps don’t seem to have Punjabi. My husband tries to help but he is definitely not a born teacher, lol. Anybody have any resources they’d recommend? Thanks!",
