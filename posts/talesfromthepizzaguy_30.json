        "text": "Ok so first this was a month and a half ago and also wasn't me but I was the manager in charge for the whole ordeal. \n\nAlright so this lady used 40% off and got a brownie and cheesestick I believe so her total with deliver fee was just shy of $10. $9.65 to be exact. \n\nNow our drivers are supposed to carry some change. Some have 4 quarters just in case, however some of the younger drivers don't care and for the most part customers don't fret about change and round it up in the tip. \n\nSo my driver heads out and all is good. I get a phone call from a disgruntled woman telling me that my driver stole her money. I finally get the story out of her and it seemed that she gave him a $10 bill and wanted her change back(no tip). When he said he didn't have the change she demanded it. \n\nThe driver went to his car but only had about 18 pennies so he decided to just leave(not the best choice but I get it).  So in order to make this woman stop calling and flipping out I sent my driver back out in the middle of dinner with $.35\n\nNeedless to say we got an online complaint and I had to explain the regional manager why it said my driver stole money from her. She neglected to include that it was $.35, that we wasted time money and gas to give her back her $.35, and that she was a complete psycho Bitch. \n\n\n\nShe was almost as bad as the lady who decided that her pizza was reason enough that I should lose my job and hopefully become homeless\n\nBut that's another story :)",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster on this subreddit. I've delivered pizzas on and off for over a decade. I have plenty more stories if people like this one.\n\nIt was a day like any other and a delivery like I had done dozens of times before. I gathered all the items this person ordered and reread the ticket. Under the comments for the driver was one word, dog. Since I work with people who range from being animal lovers to people terrified by anything resembling a non-human, this could mean anything. To say the least, it was ambiguous. I assumed it was a warning for the people who were scared of dogs. \n\nAnyway, I take this delivery to a person we'll call Martha. Martha is a woman with more dogs than she can handle. After arriving at her house I gathered her order, which was substantial. I had two bags in each hand and two hot bags full of pizzas on my arms. I could see a dog acting very nervously, but the woman assured me \"Don't worry about Fluffy, she doesn't bite. She wouldn't hurt a fly.\" She didn't finish that second sentence before I heard a dog scrambling towards me growling. Now, I'm pretty good with animals of all kinds. Even dogs deemed \"mean\" seem to like to me, but this dog decided to make an exception. Naturally, this dog did what it could as a 25ish pound dog attacking a 200 pound man. It bit me square in the ass and ran away. \n\nMartha was mortified. \"OH MY GOD! Did FLUFFY bite you?! Really?! She's NEVER done that before.\" Trying to be professional, I asked her to just pay for her order so I can get checked out.I could feel blood dripping down my leg, which is generally a bad sign. She paid (literally, not in a revenge kind of way) and I sat in my car and called my manager. Let's call him Aaron. Ah, managers. They are the concrete on which the pizza delivery business is built. What they don't tell you, however, is that the concrete is made from the ground up bones of failed delivery drivers. After telling my manager about the attack, he showed as much compassion as he was paid to by asking \"Can you finish your delivery before you go get stitches at the ER?\"\n\nIt's been years since this incident, and I still love dogs. Everything healed, except my burning hatred for managers who believe that blood should be spilled in the name of pizza delivery.",

Quite an odd thing to see driving down the road.  I carefully pass the dog and continue on my drive the remaining mile or so to get to the customer's house.  I'm exchanging pizza for money with the customer, when suddenly the very same dog comes running up the driveway.  The customer gasps, \"Dog's Name!\" (I don't remember the dogs name) \"Family! Come out here Dog is home!\"  And the entire family came running out eager to see their dog having returned to them.  In the commotion that followed, I learned that their dog had been missing for some weeks but here was their missing dog, ecstatic to see them again.  I left them to eat their pizza and spend time reuniting with their lost dog.  The tip wasn't noteworthy.",

        "text": "LONG STORY, but I feel like it MUST be shared.\n\nThis happened while I was working the cash register at a locally owned pizza joint. Our delivery driver was sitting with the manager at our 'employee' table, working on some projects for school while she waited for an order to finish up. \n\nNow, while we did delivery, we also had a decent dining room and offered sit-down service in the afternoons/evenings. I had just arrived to relieve the morning cashier, who was having trouble with a woman who was *insisting* that our cashier could not have counted her change out correctly in his head, and wanted him to use a calculator in front of her while cross-referencing her receipt to make sure she got the right change.\n\nSurprisingly, this woman was not the most difficult customer in the restaurant at that time. \n\nNo, that woman would be a fiery-red headed lady with a large, clunky arm cast who had ordered a pizza to stay. She was sitting in the back with her husband and a rather portly looking kid. This woman looked a little fried out, which is my nice way of saying she may have been a meth enthusiast. \n\nI'm trying to count my till as the morning cashier is dealing with Perfect Change Woman, when Fiery Red Head starts SHOUTING in the back.\n\n\"I NEED ALL OF MY FOOD TO GO. RIGHT NOW!!!\" I look up, and our server is at the table trying to calm this woman down. Fiery is shaking mad, and gesturing wildly with her broken arm. \n\n\"THAT GIRL-\" She points at our delivery driver, who is now looking up from her assignments with a look of pure bewilderment, \"WAS MAD DOGGIN' MY SON!\" (I had never heard this term before, but was later told it's an 'angry stare similar to mean muggin')\n\nThis was untrue, mind you. Our driver had her head down the entire time the woman was there, focused on her homework and chatting with the manager. We're all dumbfounded. Fiery is now right by the employee table, screaming at the driver. \"I'll fight you bitch! Don't ever look at my boy like that! What kind of place is this?!\" Our driver is a pretty sarcastic and wonderful girl, and just kinda rolls her eyes.\n\n\"I wasn't looking at your son.\" This causes the woman to fly into a HYPER-RAGE. She seriously looked like she was going to punch our driver out. The manager is trying to get her to leave, and from the look on her face I wouldn't have been surprised if she had tried to deck him, as well. Fiery decides *against* going to prison that day, and instead yanks the to-go box from our server and marches towards the exit, shaking. Her husband follows sheepishly, and her kid just has the smuggest look on his little face. At this point, I'm running high on adrenaline and afraid I'm gonna have to hit the emergency button under our register to get the cops over here. \n\nFiery is shouting about how her son doesn't deserve such treatment, and all of a sudden Perfect Change Woman joins right in???? Insisting our restaurant is the least professional place she's ever been, that she's going to work with Fiery to get us a bad rating from the Better Business Bureau, that maybe there's a lawsuit in this. Mind you, these women did not come in together and did not know each other. Guess birds of a shit feather flock together!\n\nAll of these lovely, *lovely* people leave the store, and we all think the ordeal is over. We're about to trade some nervous laughs about the situation when we realize... Fiery is just sitting out there in her husband's truck, staring in through the huge glass windows we have along the storefront.\n\nThey sit in the truck, MAD DOGGIN' US, for almost 5 whole minutes. We're freaked out. This woman is mental. The truck pulls away and we breathe a sigh of relief. An order comes up and our plucky driver takes it, obviously happy to be out of the store for a bit.\n\nWe're all finally getting over this insanity when our manager points out that, while the truck HAD pulled away... they had only pulled into a parking lot catty corner to our restaurant (we were located on the corner of an intersection). Fiery and her freaky family stayed in that lot for an additional 5 minutes. Just staring. Mad doggin'.\n\nEven after they finally left, there was this static in the air. We joked that they were gonna come back and attack us at some point... but it didn't really feel funny. The woman was gone by the time our driver returned, for which I was thankful. Would not have been the least bit shocked if she had tried to ambush our driver. Probably one of the most surreal and intense bad customer experience I have ever had!",

        "text": "This is a holiday tipping rant I posted 5 years ago on a debate board I frequent.\n\nAs the major \"holiday\" season is now upon us, it is time for my annual holiday rant. I am a pizza delivery driver (obviously)\n\nI have had my share, this (and past) holiday season(s), of bah HUMBUG stiffs, joke tips and underwelmed tips. Yes I have had some good (even great) tips but the usual crop of stiffers and undertippers is STILL there. \n\nWhat I really hate the most about this time of year is the pitiful and transparent facade some people put on (as in wear when in \"public\"). By this I mean some people get all \"happy and cheerful\" to those around them. eg. co-workers, friends, family, and the poor workers who have to brave the insanity that is the commercialized Xmas season. Unfortuneately it is ONLY a thin venier because as soon as your back is turned or the \"holiday season\" ends they revert back to their \"true\" self ie. with no reason \"for the cheerful season\" why be nice and cheerful to others. and most others around them recognize the thin venier and see it for what, IMO, it really is, a LIE for the season.\n\nThe ones I HATE the most are the \"customers\" who, as they are giving me exact change or a \"tip\" rounded up to the nearest dollar say the following in that sickly sweet and holiday cheery type voice: \"Have a MERRY CHRISTMAS/HAPPY HOLIDAYS/HAPPY New Year. Drive safe/keep warm. OH and THANKS for coming out in such bad weather.\" (lots of cold weather and snow during the season) making sure to SPECIFICALLY emphasis the MERRY or HAPPY part without (in IMHO) very much meaning behind it. It all seems so \"canned\" or parroted (just as the poor retail type clerks/persons are \"required\" by their employer to say some holiday greeting/parting words). This false platitude just irks me to no end.\n\n\nThe next catageory is the \"holiday tipper\". Most delivery drivers and servers know this one as well as I do. A few of the usual hard hearted/small hearted Grinch stiffers are \"semi-kind hearted\" (as in their heart grew maybe 1/2% bigger) during the roughly 5 week period of Thanksgiving/Xmas/New Year. They \"consent\" to letting a mere dollar or two squeeze past their tightly clenched Scroogie fingers on a $40 order. The remaining 11 months they basically laugh in your face with exact change or a big fat ZERO on the CC tip line. Yes I know the Scrooge is strong but come on!!!!! \n\nI know for a fact that you do order on a regular basis. I know your address by heart. I know every detail about the front of your house. Where are you getting the $$$ to order delivery food 5 DAY STRAIGHT (and this is on a regular basis)???? Heck I WANT YOUR job and you can have mine. \n\nWith the Holiday tipper, they show they DO know about and understand the concept of tipping those whose income depends heavily on tips. What pleasure does it give them to attempt to be slightly \"non-Scroogie\" during a very short period of time?? Is it some guilty conscience type thing??? Is it some kind of weird \"Xmas duty\" type thing???? \n\nWHY OH WHY is this 5 week period any different than the other 47 weeks in the year????? ",

Well I notice he's filling out the tip and total, so you get that quick \"fuck yeah\" moment before you get it back.\n\nSo I hand him his food and he gives me the slip, exchange pleasantries. So usually I wait until I'm back to my car to look at the slip. Now I've had people write in 0.00 on the tip and still add it together, while tipping me cash anyway.

I go in on sunday, ask them if they'll need me, I get a \"maybe\" from one of the assistant managers. I go in on tuesday, my day off, and ask them again, because I might be going out of town to visit family. I get a \"no, we have plenty of drivers\" from the GM. Alright, fine with me. Fast forward to today, and I get a call in, they need me ASAP for an early (1PM is \"early\" as far as our stores go) shift, and so I head in hoping to make some decent money. Well, I took around 12 deliveries, and about 1/3 of the deliveries stiffed me. If not for one single delivery where I got a $10 tip, it would have been a complete shit night. At least I got my time's worth, considering holiday pay. \n\nAnyone else get any shitty thanksgiving shifts?",

        "text": "So, I've posted a few of my pizza stories here before. Obviously, I have another one to tell. Whether it's great or not is up to you guys. I help manage a pizza joint that's franchised, but ultimately falls under the *oh so wonderful* Papa John's banner. /s \n\nTonight, I wasn't even scheduled, but Big Boss Man said I could work volume, and since our two main phone people did not show up, that was a good call. \n\nSo I'm on phones. I answer a call. This guy wants delivery, and his info shows a couple of different addresses, one of them a hotel. He says it's hotel address and his room number was already saved in his info. His name from now on will be HD for Hotel Dude, ME for, of course, yours truly the OP idwthis, and TB for the driver who got to take this particular delivery. \n\nFirst off, HD says he wants an extra large  pizza. No problem at all, and I at first ring him up for a large pizza, giving him our everyday special of any large for 12 bucks price,  and he wants sausage and pepperoni for the whole pizza, adding double mushroom to  half of it.  No problemo, and I input his toppings, then hit the 'pay' button, which gives me the option to \"Papa Size\" his pizza to an extra large for three dollars. I hit that button. \n\nSo his total comes to 20 bucks and change. I try to upsell the required three items such as cheesesticks, wings, or dessert, but he declines. So I repeat his order, an extra large pizza with sausage and pepperoni on the whole thing, add double mushroom to one half. I tell him his total which is 20 bucks and change. \n\nThe way he reacted, oh my. Let's just say it wasn't the way someone who expected full menu price for such an item to react. If ordered on the web currently for our area, it would cost you 27 bucks and change. But since I thought this guy was  nice enough, I at first rang him up for a large pizza, gave him the coupon that would make the large 12 dollars, then I 'papa sized' it to an extra large. \n\nThat made his total 20 bucks and change. But when he heard that, he flipped out. I wasn't sure  at first that anything was wrong, I can't do math that freaking well in my head, so with delivery fee and tax, I thought it was right. But this guy, he immediately starts freaking out, telling me I'm wrong, and at first, I say that of course tax and delivery fee will add more to his total. \n\nBut no, he keeps ranting that I'm wrong. He ordered an extra large not even three days ago (his words) and it wasn't that much even for delivery. \n\nAnd I try to at first, apologize if it seems like there is an error, but he keeps ranting that it shouldn't be that much. Even throws in a \"damn\" and a \"fuck\" in there. So I get a little fucking snotty and say \"Sir, if you would just give me a moment, I can try to find out where this might have gone wrong.\" \n\nHe hangs up on me. I leave his order on my screen, talk to my coworkers about this rude dude, he calls back. Hangs up on my coworker. Then he calls back again, so I answer. He asks for a manager after I give our franchise's opening spiel. I've never felt such satisfaction as saying \"speaking\" as I did then. \n\nAnd no god damn lie, Hotel Dude says \"Oh, Fuck Me!\" and hangs up again. \n\nAnd since I have his order still on my goddamn screen, I find out what in the hell went wrong. For some reason when large pizzas are rung up a certain way, even with the \"make this 5 topping/specialty pizza 12 bucks\" button being hit, doubly especially when it's half and half pizzas, it says \"fuck you, I'll ring it up  this way.\" \n\nSo I had to do the manager magic and give it the discount of \"manager says it should be this off\" and I got the large pizza with his wanted toppings down to the 12 dollar plus tax and delivery fee price. AND THEN I papa sized the damn thing. So now it was 18 dollars and change. \n\nSo I called the customer back ( thank goodness for caller id and call log on our store phones!) and HD answered all resigned and sad like, and he barely thanked me when I told him I figured out what went wrong, and what his price should be. And then he hung up on me after I told him the delivery time and that I hoped he had a nice evening. \n\nThe delivery guy who took the order you ask? Well, Delivery Dude says that the guy tipped him two bucks, which is the highest tip he has ever gotten from that particular hotel, which is one of those long term stay hotels, along with being by the night. \n\nThe guy asked to see the pizza first, of course, before paying  and tipping, and the driver said that when the HD opened the pizza box, he said \"Wow, it looks good!\" \n\nIt damn well better have! \n\nI know, I shouldn't have catered to someone who wanted to curse at me, and my employees/managers. \n\nBut damn it made me feel good to call him back and give him the right price, while saying \"Now that I had a moment to do the god damn math, this is your price\" \n\nand it made me feel good that a driver got the best tip he's ever gotten in his (ok, relatively short) time working for us from this particular long term hotel. \n\n\n ",

        "text": "What a night. This all happened earlier tonight on my last shift before the holiday. I drive for a pickup service. This is a long one.\n\nI got two orders from a restaurant that generally has good tippers, and after my first hour of garbage stiffs, I was excited. I arrived with 2 minutes to spare on the timer for the first, and three minutes on the second. I pick up, everyone is all smiles, I say \"Thank you,\" she says \"Have a great night!\" and I'm off to the customers.\n\nI arrive at location 1 and call. This is as near a word for word as I can remember. I'm Me and the customer is DC (Dick customer)\n\n**Me:** Hi this is Delivery Company with an order for you from Restaurant. I'm outside.\n\n**DC:** WHAT THE FUCK TOOK SO LONG?\n\n**Me:** Sir I've only had possession of your food for ten minutes. I drove...\n\n**DC:** I FUCKING ORDERED THREE FUCKING HOURS AGO WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU ASSHOLES?\n\n**Me:** I don't work for the restaurant, we only pick up and drop off for them. I've...\n\n**DC:** FUCK YOU DICKHEAD I CALLED THREE FUCKING TIMES...\n\n**Me:** HEY. Listen. I do not work for the restaurant. I've literally had your food in my car for ten minutes...\n\n**DC:** LISTEN YOU FUCK, I KNOW YOU'VE HAD IT FOR...\n\n**Me:** HEY! I'm outside with your food. Do you want the food?\n\n**DC:** FUCK YOU. I FUCKING CANCELED THAT ORDER SO YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF. \n\n*(I literally start laughing out loud)*\n\n**Me:** Dude I don't work for the restaurant. I get paid even if I take this back. I really don't care if you get it or not but I'm here. You want me to return it?\n\n**DC:** GO FUCK YOURSELF. *click*.\n\nI contact dispatch and tell them to deal with this with the restaraunt while I head to the second dropoff, which is now getting late-ish. I arrive, and a very nice lady comes out, signs the receipt and then this happens. I'm me, she's NL for Nice Lady.\n\n**NL:** So this is funny. I canceled this.\n\n**Me:** Wait, you too? *(I explain a short, more polite version of what just happened.)*\n\n**NL:** I've been waiting 2 hours, they said it was the Grubhub driver's fault. They said you had it more than an hour ago.\n\n*(Grubhub is just one of the ordering platforms around here. There's like 7, but they aren't connected to us in any way. I explain a quick version of who we are, tell her how to get our app so she can see exactly who has her food and when)*\n\n**NL:** Well, I'll take the food because I'm hungry, and I don't want you to get in trouble or lose money.\n\n*(She signs the receipt and TIPS ME 6 FRICKIN DOLLARS!)*\n\n**Me:** Wow, ma'am that is just so nice of you. I really...\n\n*(NL's phone rings. I mime like I'll just take off but as I turn she puts her hand on my arm and signs for me to stay, with thsi really excited look on her face. I wait. she puts it on speaker. Now we add a new person, let;s call her LIAR)*\n\n**LIAR:** Well we sent the order more than an hour ago so...\n\n**NL:** Ma'am, I am standing here with the driver right now. He can hear you.\n\n(A SHITLOAD OF PREGNANT PAUSING HAPPENS FROM LIAR)\n\n**Me:** Yes, this is the driver that took those two orders from you about 20 minutes ago. You know I didn't have them an hour ago. You also know that our system knows EXACTLY when you put them up for us to get, and EXACTLY when I took them. There were 2 and 3 minutes left on the orders when I picked them up. Why are you telling the customers we've had them for hours? Why didn't you tell me the last one was more than two hours late? This incredibly nice lady has been telling me what you told her, and she has agreed not only to take the cold food, but she's tipped me very generously. You, on the other hand, got me cursed out and wasted my time and my gas with this little stunt. You can bet your account manager will be having a conversation with you about this. It's unacceptable to lie to customers, and it's unacceptable to cost me time and money.\n\n**LIAR:** Well they told me it was late.\n\n**Me:** They who? You know exactly what you put in the computer for Delivery Company. You also know I picked them up early, and you know that you left out the fact that they were *extremely* late orders before I ever touched them.\n\n**LIAR:** Well does she want it?\n\n**Me:** Yes, because she's literally the nicest woman I have met on this job. I'll be bringing the other order back to you when I can.\n\nAt this point the Nice Lady thanked me again, we talked quickly about our app that she can track us with and I got in my car. I told my boss and dispatch everything that just happened. I returned the food, by which time the account manager had contacted them and wow, was the restaurant lady sheepish and apologetic. I finished the night strong with a series of really, I mean *quite* good tips from a new place we deliver for as of this week.\n\nFast forward to a few hours after my shift. My boss gets in touch and tells me they know the story. The restaurant also contracts with another delivery service, one that uses a word defined as \"denoting an outstanding or supreme example of a particular kind of person or thing.\" (spoiler: they are literally the opposite of that.) \n\nWell. It appears that they submitted these orders to that service and no one ever showed up to get them. So, instead of telling us the truth (and maybe tipping the drivers since they know damn well the customers won't now) they just submitted them to us like normal orders. They have been put on warning: get rid of the other service and stop lying about us. \n\nIn the end I came away with one good tip and a good customer in NL, and she'll be using us in the future now that she understands how to find places we drive for with our app. Still...weird night, man. Weird night.\n",

Not one time have I ever skipped an order, even if I knew it was going to an unhappy customer or a non-tipper.  I gave it a week of thought and decided that it was time to hang up my bag.  My integrity is worth more than this, I know what I did and didn't do.  Really, it was just the last straw tbh.  I'm tired of wearing those derpy uniforms, working until 3 or 4 in the morning, hating on myself because I chose to settle.\n\nThe reality of the matter is this folks, this is a dead end job.  Its cool for students and extra money on the side but your soul slowly degrades over several years if you are a long hauler.\n\nI respect each and every one of you who has to deal with the idiocy, low pay, and zero respect.  My hat is off to all of you who continue to do what you have to do, in all weather conditions, to support yourselves and your family.  This is just my experience, and I wish all of you the best deliveries on newly poured asphalt and to happy customers.  \n\nI look forward to reading your continuing adventures.

It has 2 holes at the top, 1 on the back so it can be hung up, [and one on the front for purposes I do not know](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Wood-clipboard.jpg). These holes do not line up, and when I stick my pen through the front hole, it stays at about a 45 degree angle to the board and comes out with minimal effort. When people sign their receipts, most of the time they don't bother trying to put the pen back and just hand it to me. That's fine, it's quick, and I can't blame people for not wanting to waste more effort on putting away a stranger's pen. About half of the times where they do try to put the pen back, they get it right, but the other half, they are convinced that the pen absolutely must go through both holes. The pen does not fit through both holes. When they try to put it through both holes, they inevitably get it how I had it the first time, decide that it is wrong, take it out, get it right again, take it out again, then either give up or jam it through hard enough to force it through both holes and get stuck. I really must start stopping these people from wasting their effort and both of our time.  \nRelated:  \n1) I hand the customer the clipboard, which has two copies of their receipt on it.  \n2) Customer signs one receipt while I take the food out of the bag.  \n3) Customer gives me back clipboard, I give them the food.  \n4) \"Can I get a copy of the receipt?\"  \nYou just had both receipts and free hands, why did you not just take it then?  \nBut the absolute most annoying little thing people do is not tip, then say \"'Preciate it.\" I know not everyone tips, that is part of the job, but when they don't tip and flat out lie about appreciating that I am bringing them food while they get to sit around, that just rustles my jimmies. They can't even be bothered to say the whole word. ",

I always get balancing and alignment with new tires. I never abuse my car. I'm looking to spend max, 100 a tire. \n\nSuggestions? Decades ago, I got a set of nittos that gave awesome performance, lots of meat on the tire, and lasted a very long time. \n\nI'm in the deep south. Mostly high temps, but sometimes bad rain. Rarely temps below 50.\n\nI don't remember the exact model of tire I have, it didn't get good reviews. I'm close to 30k on this set. The roads here are mostly mixed with coral, very abrasive.\n\nI will buy the tires from the seller, and have my decades trusted mechanic install them. \n\nAccording to goodyear, my tire is a 205/55/r16. It is too late at night for me to verify at my car. \n\nI could go to pep boys, like I have done in the past, but reading the fine print, they want permission to fuck with your tpms sensors, in order to cover their warranty. I, as well as my mechanic, agree that you shouldn't be fucking around with a sensor, if it is working, and not giving you problems. Knowing pb, the idiots there would probably fuck up a perfectly good working piece of hardware. ",

        "text": "So this is kind of a strange situation/question...\n\nI've been working for myself for the past six years. Working from home. My wife also works from home. We had a child 15 months ago. For the first 10 months of his life, I was the only one working, then my wife got her job and I have been watching our son during the day ever since and am only able to get work done occasionally. This makes it incredibly difficult for me to continue working steadily because I can't exactly conduct conference calls with a toddler running around.\n\nAnyway, so, I've decided to deliver pizzas in the evenings and on the weekends for now to bring in some extra cash. I did this around 16 years ago when I was in college and really enjoyed the experience. No, I'm not seeking to make a career out of this, and, as the economy hopefully continues to improve, I'll be looking for a job that can leverage my experience and education.\n\nSo, with all of that said, there is a Papa John's (where I worked in college) and a Dominos in my town. It's a fairly economically depressed area.\n\nI've spoken with managers at both stores and both seem interested. Obviously, both stores are going to pay minimum wage-ish plus tips and money for gas (when I did this 16 years ago, it was $.75 per delivery.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is this: so, Papa John's is more expensive, so do you think that means people would tip less because they are paying more for the pizza, or maybe they will tip higher because they are able to afford Papa John's...and the same in the inverse for Dominos...lower cost of pizza may leave more money for tips, OR, because the customer is ordering the lower cost pizza, they may not have money for a tip at all.\n\nThoughts?",

Never had a problem, I always give fat tips, upwards of 30% usually. Where I live is very easy to find, BIG reflective numbers on the post of the mailbox out by the side of the road.  \n\nAnyway, my order is on the way, so I get my cash ready and use the restroom(number 1) so I can meet the guy outside to make it a quick transaction. Apparently he had called me twice in the 30 seconds I was in the bathroom, didn't leave a voicemail, and wouldn't answer when I tried to call him back less than 2 minutes later. So I bring my phone outside and wait. I see a driver pass the house then brake quickly and turn around a couple driveways down thinking \"thank god\". He pulls in and the convo goes: (PM = Pizza Man)  \n\n  Me: How's it goin.  \n\n  PM: I called twice.  \n\n  Me: I saw that, sorry I was in the bathroom, I tried to call back but you didn't answer.  \n\n  PM: You almost didn't get your food.  \n\n  Me: Cool. It's paid for correct?  \n\n  PM: Yes. (Handing over food)  \n\n  Me: Thanks have a good one. (Giving him the tip he probably didn't deserve)  \n\nFairly chill convo but rather rude on his end. I almost filed a complaint, but I know how annoying those are for the store to deal with. Its not cool to treat customers like this. The way I was trained, you need to do anything and everything in your power to get the customer their food, **while** being **kind and courteous**.  \n\nRemember guys, we're all just people, so don't go taking frustrations out on customers.  \n\nMay your days be lax and your tips bountiful.  \n\nEdited for formatting.

I've had the unfortunate pleasure of delivering to this house about 4.8 miles out on our delivery zone, and it just seems like every time we deliver to them, something is wrong with their pizza..\n\nwell, this time around, she said that she had ordered 6 garlic sauces, but on the ticket it said 6 ranches..

        "text": "Hello fellow drivers,\n\nI have a PSA specific to Pizza Hut. If you don't work at Pizza Hut, this will likely make no sense. \n\nI'm a driver and manager. I switch between mostly managing and mostly driving depending on who's doing the schedule. Now I'm mostly driving, but still have my manager access and keys and stuff. Regardless of whether I'm driving or managing, I get along with all but 2 drivers. 1 is new; he's been around for just over 2 months. He's extremely slow at everything, like he'll take 7 minutes to enter an order and 45 minutes to go 6 miles round trip. He hardly does side work until someone forces him. He will walk past the counter and instead of saying \"someone will be right with you\" to a guest, he'll start trying to get into a register, which he doesn't have access to. I say all this to paint the picture that he's fucking annoying. He also asks endless stupid questions. Apparently he's just between jobs and has had a good career in tech with good degrees so he isn't cognitively disabled, just the type of person you'd want to slap. The other driver I don't get on with is shady. He will dispatch on orders, go outside to smoke, tag in and dispatch on some more, and then finally go. He'll take 6+ orders each run. He's fast and usually takes them all from the relatively shitty area within a mile of the store. It has never bothered me since he helps clear the screen so I can leave... until now. \n\nOk so that's the background. Now, here's the issue. These 2 have decided that I \"cherry pick\" deliveries. They claim that I have tricks to make myself get the \"good\" areas. What tricks? Having management access. Here's the PSA: **when ANYONE is logged in with a driver bank, their password ONLY functions as a driver password on the dispatch terminal.** It will not work to bundle non-touching zones, it will not authorize triples/quads/etc, it will not modify a dispatch or dispatch order. Also, there is absolutely no way to rearrange the dispatch order unless you know everyone's password and are shady enough to toggle them unavailable in an order that you like. Ironically, they all know my password, but I don't know theirs so even if I wanted to do something so dumb, I couldn't. They bitch to the new GM and he is too green to know this. Every time, I tell him to pull a driver audit so he can see. If I were doing something, I'm the kind of person that would own up to it because doing so would only piss them off more. But I'm not. \n\nWhat's the point of all of this? If you're a driver that works with a driver that has management access AND you're paranoid that he/she is using said access in a big conspiracy to take good orders, you're fucking delusional. I'm told that this isn't limited to my store so that's why I'm sharing. Guess what? Every order is a gamble. The \"good\" areas are far and still could stiff. I had a stiff in our best area today. There are shitty people everywhere. I don't think anyone would try to manipulate the system (if it were possible) to always take the far ones. Delivery is a numbers game. I'd much rather take a double to the iffy area close to the store and come back fast for another double than take 1 order to the nice subdivisions. 4 $2 tips + $4 from the delivery fees is $12. It's highly unlikely that even the best area would tip enough to do better. So stop being so stupid, Mike. \n\nI'm so sick of dealing with him whining about something that doesn't exist that when either of these drivers come in, I log off. It's not worth it to argue with them. But perhaps this PSA can diffuse similar situations in your store. So again, management passwords don't work on the dispatch terminal when logged in as a driver.",

        "text": "Just as background, I'm female. I deliver pizza for a local family owned place, in a kind of rural area, just 2-3 nights a week as a side-job. Sweet deal, the owners are awesome, I know the area well, I get paid hourly, plus $2 for each run, and tips, all cash at the end of the night. My town, it's a small-town, but big in area, with lots of long windy back-roads, farms, etc. Most of my deliveries are to these \"out-of-town\" areas, seriously one run can take 25-30 minutes round-trip. But I love to drive, people tip great here, and I just really enjoy the job. I've done pizza delivery on and off on the side for about 10 years now, but this was the first time I had a delivery that creeped me out and pissed me off at the same time.  \n\nSo we got a call to deliver to #2 &lt;Private Road&gt;. I'd never even heard of this road, even though I've lived in this town for almost 20 years. Boss-man explained that it's a private road, only a few houses, just off of &lt;Back Road&gt; where I deliver often. He explained that, the front door of the house is actually a &lt;Back Road&gt; address, so when they order for &lt;Private Road&gt;, we deliver to the side/back door. IDK how this is legal, having one house with two different street-addresses, but whatever, Boss Man knows what he's talking about, right? Off I go.  \n\nI ended up driving back and forth on &lt;Back Road&gt; a bunch of times. Nowhere did I see any kind of sign for &lt;Private Road&gt;. I should also mention that this was nighttime, and the road is very dark! Finally, I spot what looks like a driveway, pull in, and see other houses. I turned around, parked...right next to a mailbox that had #2 on it. Figuring this had to be the place, I got ready to head out and deliver the goods and be on my way. So I got out and took the hot bag out of the backseat, started walking toward the back/side door, but there was not a single light, anywhere. No outside lights, no street lights, no lights on in any windows. And now I wasnt even sure I had the right place. So I decided to grab my phone and call the people. Put everything back in the car, go to grab my phone out of the cupholder, and...no phone! So it's pitch-dark on this creepy little road, the house is dark, I've got my interior light on, searching for my phone, a little panic setting in. But I just wanted to get this damn food delivered and get moving again! So I sucked it up, got out again and started into the dark back/side yard. Got a few steps in and saw 3 storage containers with padlocks on the outside. Not even embarrassed to admit, I just noped out of there, fuck that, poking around a dark yard at night, a woman alone with no phone, and there was recently a story in the news about a woman found chained up in a storage container. My brain just went \"Nope, fuck this noise, Im out!\"  \n \n\nGot back in the car, planning to just drive back to the restaurant and tell Boss-Man to send someone else. Drove around the corner, back onto &lt;Back Road&gt; and, Oh, well, hello! Dude and his wife are sitting on the front porch of the house, with the light on! I pulled over, rolled down the passenger window, called out \"Are you guys actually #2&lt;Private Road&gt;?\" Yup. Great. Pull in the driveway, get out again, deliver the goods, get a $5 tip on a credit card, really nice people. I told him what Boss-Man had told me, to go the back, etc...the guy was like \"Yeah, I dont know why he thinks that, it messes up the driver everytime!\"  \n\nGot back to the restaurant and made Boss-Man pull up their info and change that whole \"back/side door\" thing in the instructions, so no one else gets as confused as I was! And I had him call my cell phone, which I found wedged under the power-seat mechanisms.   \n\nThat one trip took almost 45 minutes and I was seriously thrown off for the rest of my shift. Not the most exciting story, but just wanted to share it with other drivers who get it, how one screwy instruction can throw off the whole damn trip!",

        "text": "Last night was a fairly busy Saturday night, but nothing out of the ordinary. At least, that is, until I took this delivery.\n\nI pull up to the house. It's in an older, but fairly standard middle-class housing development. Porch light is on... I can see some lights are on in the house through the curtains. Everything seems normal from the outside.\n\nI walk up and go inside a small enclosed porch area with the outer door propped open. The doorbell is hanging out of the wall about six inches by a couple of wires. I ignore it and go with a medium power knock instead, the kind that will easily activate a dog without being too forceful.\n\nI notice a small plastic sign on the door. Suddenly, I hear at least two people inside start arguing loudly with each other. I can't make out what they are saying. The sign on the door is in English and Spanish. It says something like \"Please no smoking. Oxygen tank in use.\" The argument was fairly muffled lasting only 5-10 seconds, until I hear clearly \"F*** YOU!\" followed by the sound of someone stomping. The stomping is getting closer to the door and I start preparing myself for an angry customer.\n\nInstead, I hear a door slam in the room on my right. I assume some kind of bedroom. I hear sobbing and mumbling coming from the bedroom. I linger outside waiting for the door to open for probably only a few seconds, but that awkward period of time seemed much longer at the time. The door opens. An old woman, maybe 70 years old, is standing there. I say \"Hello there\" and look down to the receipt to quote the cash total she owes. I still hear the sobbing and mumbling, maybe as if an upset younger woman is on the phone in the next room. The old lady immediately says, \"Step inside.\" and opens the door wider and motions with her arm.\n\nNormally I avoid entering houses, but I make exceptions for elderly or disabled people who need help handling their orders. This was a 5 pizza order, so I assume she needs me to set it down somewhere for her. I'm not sure what to do after the commotion I heard, but I just want to get this over with quickly, so I hesitantly step inside.\n\nI tell her the total: $40.XX. She replies almost offended, \"Forty dollars!?\"... I think to myself \"Oh boy... are we REALLY going to do this song and dance.\" Then a balding middle-aged man comes around the corner to save the situation. He says, \"Don't listen to her, she doesn't know what I ordered.\" She gives him a dirty look and walks away and he takes her place. He opens his wallet and counts out $45 to hand me. The sobbing and desperate mumbling in the next room continues. As he is counting the money, he calmly says \"I hope you don't think we are crazy. It's not normally like this around here.\" He hands me the cash. I hand him the stack of pizza. He looks at me, completely deadpan... \"My dad just died...\" and motions behind him toward a couch that I hadn't noticed. A wrinkled, pale old man, probably 70-80 years old, with his eyes closed and a blanket draped over him up to his shoulders is lying motionless about 10 feet away from me. The guy takes his stack of pizza and turns to walk away. I am completely stunned and mumble something stupid as I'm backing out the door like \"Uh... I hope it gets better.\" The guy keeps walking into the next room, no acknowledgement. I close the door and hurry to my car, driving in stunned silence back to the store after being suddenly reminded of human mortality.\n\nAt least I got a $5 tip.",

When he realizes this, he calls the cadet back but he doesn't answer. So he sends a text telling him he was shorted $8. The kid texts back, \"That's your problem now, pizza boy.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the driver is PISSED. He drives around until he finds a security guard and tells him what happened. The guard goes with him back to the prep school and calls the Marine Corps colonel who runs the school. The O-6 comes down with the cadet, forces him to pay the $8 he shorted the driver, plus a $20 tip. The colonel then told the cadet that he was on restriction for two weeks and all his privileges had been revoked.\n\nWe found out later that the kid ended up getting kicked out of the school, so he sent an email to corporate to complain. Nothing ever came of it because everyone involved saw right away what a dick this kid was and we were all glad someone like that won't be in the military.",

        "text": "About a week ago I took an order out into the sticks around my area. It's the middle of the night, so dark I can't even see the house I'm delivering to due to the lack of street lights and the fact that the place is totally fenced in and locked. So I'm standing out there at the curb and I call up my customer to have her come out to meet me, lit only by my car topper and headlights. \n\nWhile I wait (and it's a significant wait) there are two huge dogs at the gate snarling at me. I love dogs, even the big ones that get excited and jump on you while their owner apologizes over and over, but I can tell the difference between a \"hey, there's a person!\" bark and a \"I'll freaking kill you if you come a step closer\" bark. These two are baying out the latter. \n\nI see a figure finally coming towards the gate. It's a kid, can't be more than ten. Never a good sign, at least tip-wise, and it's especially bad in this case due to the large amount of food the woman has ordered that the kid might drop and blame me for (five pizzas, two orders of wings, two orders of brownies, and a 2 liter soda). The dogs immediately flank him, and they both look like they outweigh him significantly. \n\nI step back and wait for the kid to come outside the gate so we can get our business completed, but he stays inside. I ask him to come out so I can more easily give him his food (kid's shorter than the fence is) and he responds with a \"no.\" Trying to call my customer again to have her come out yields no results. So I slip the credit card slips through the gaps in the gate.\n\nImmediately the dogs try to bite me.\n\nI yank back and while the kid signs the slips try to call the customer again. No answer. I give up on that front and ask the kid himself if he could secure the dogs somewhere before I hand him his food. I get a no again. \n\nSo, piece by piece I hand each part of the order through to the kid, each time yanking my hand back before teeth can clamp into me. The kid, to his credit, is trying to get the dogs to calm down, but it has no effect on them. Eventually the dogs manage to knock a box out of my hands, but luckily it's just brownies so a trip to the ground in a closed box doesn't mess them up any. \n\nI finish up the business there (the entire ordeal took about 15 minutes, not counting travel time) and report the issues to my boss when I get back. I'm instructed to ask the woman to secure her dogs before sending out a delivery to her next time.\n\nFast forward to today, she calls once more. Once again she orders a large amount of food and I recognize the order immediately. I call her and ask her to lock her dogs up until the delivery is completed in order to avoid potential injury to our driver (which was going to be me again, not that I mentioned that to her). \n\nFor my efforts I got an earful about how her dogs were there to protect her family and it's her right to have them freeroaming on her property and how dare I ask her to lock them up and how she should be getting her food free this time because her last driver had dropped something and blown up her phone and yatta yatta yatta. She then cancelled her order and promised to never call again.\n\nGood riddance.\n\nTl;dr: If your dog cannot differentiate between a delivery person invited onto your property and someone that intends you harm, it's not a guard dog, it's an attack dog. And maybe ordering in isn't an option you should consider. ",

A standard tip is about $2-$3 and I'll normally make about $8-$10 in tips a night. \n\nI took a few pizzas to a house, was a pretty standard delivery, the total was $69. \n\nI handed the dude his pizzas and he looked in his hands at a bunch of crumpled up notes, counted up $70 and handed them to me. I swear on my life that I counted 2 $20 and 3 $10 notes, so I put them messily into my bum bag and asked him if he wanted his change. \n\nThe cheap p***k said yes, which meant no tip for me, and I handed him his $1 coin and left. \n\nHere's the best part. \n\nWhen I got back to my car and went to rearrange the money in my bag because I am very OCD with my bag and I like it to be in order so I can get the money out easier, somehow there was an extra $10 note. I checked and checked and recounted to make sure, because both this guy and me had only counted $70 not $80, but low and behold there was an extra $10 there. Now if this person was really nice and had given me a decent tip I probably would've returned the money. But considering that this was what looked like a house party of a bunch of 20yr olds who had most likely just thrown the money at the guy who paid me, I doubted that he even knew how much he'd given me. \n\nSo I kept the cheap bastard's $10 and went on to make a personal record breaking $45 in tips that night.

        "text": "This is my story. When my previous job in the insurance industry started to disgust me, I decided to quit and instead of waiting jobless, I decided to apply to a pizza place where I knew a couple of acquaintances from Kyrgyzstan were at. Maybe, that was my first mistake: working at a pizzeria that had workers who were from the countries of the collapsed Soviet Union. I, myself, am an immigrant from Ukraine, and even though I want to believe that my people or fellow brothers would never be the first to mistreat their own, I've only seen otherwise. \n \nLet me introduce you, to the place I work/worked at. Driver responsibilities: dipping sauces, boxes, dough(make,portion,pan them,rotation),dishes, floors, stocking whenever truck comes(drinks/food), portioning out desserts, and since I'm \"special\" I help out the cook and do everything in regards to front of the house(cut pizza/answer calls/place orders from online requests.) All of this is worth 5-6 dollars per hour, plus tips, which mainly depend on which deliveries you get, meaning if you're on good terms with the manager on shift then you're going to make good money and if not he'll make sure to give you deliveries that have prepaid tips between 1 -3 dollars and have you going in different directions. Even though everyone is bound to have 10 hours of overtime at least, we don't get paid for overtime. Just last week I finished with 75 hours. \n At first, everyone doubted me because of my gender and because I didn't work in the restaurant industry for a while. My very first week there, they made sure that I would wash all the pans in between each and every delivery and assigned me to do 5 closing shifts in a row, thinking it would break me. Everyone was betting how long, I would last but I made it. It took me two weeks to get 4th place and one month to take 1st. I proved everyone wrong. It wasn't long until one of the owner's asked if I would like to become manager because of how fast I can grasp things and knowledge of three languages. After that day, things went downhill. The owner asked for one of the manager's to train me, and that very manager from that day, made my life at work a living hell. There are some things I can ignore/brush off, but how much can a person take? The yelling, the cursing, the belittling, and the lying behind my back in regards to me as an employee. \n \nOne day, I decided to return the encounter. After coming to work one hour early to a 12 hour shift with a 101F degree fever, we agreed upon me leaving at 3:00 A.M. Around 2:55, while I was cleaning the table, he comes up behind me saying - \"Clean the table.\" I turn around and ask - \"Do you not see what I am doing?\" It took seconds for it to turn into an argument and I'm left at fault for being \"rude.\" It ended with \"How are you talking to me? I told you to stop.\" I replied with \"When you'll stop, I'll stop.\" Then his final reply was - \"We'll see.\" He's not stupid, he will specifically say things to me only when nobody or one person is around. Not that it matters the whole talk is in Russian, while the owners are Polaks and customers are English speaking for the most part. I usually picked up a couple of shifts throughout the week. The next day, i message the owner if she needed help at the other location. She replies saying that what I did on Thursday was unacceptable, that I left the manager hanging at a very tough moment. After that she didn't offer me any extra shifts for at least three weeks, which means she took his side over mine. I was amused because I left at the exact time as I was supposed to, with two other drivers there and only three recent deliveries on the board; anyhow, I still asked prior to leaving if any deliveries needed to be done which was answered with a snotty \"No.\" \n \nI was tolerant until I noticed that I was making less and less, as far as tips go, when I working on the same shift with him. One time, Two times, Three times, and so forth; I had to come to the realization that it wasn't a coincidence anymore. I went from making a 100 dollars for 22 deliveries to not even 35 and yes it's possible when you have many prepaid deliveries from online orders. When favoritism results with a negative effect on someone's income, that's when it becomes not just an emotional or a moral issue, but a financial one. The second major encounter hit a home run for me. \n\nIt was the opening shift on a Monday, till 5 P.M. I only made 7 deliveries; we were that slow. During all those hours I did the general cleaning: tables, behind all the equipment and appliances, all the floors(sweep and mop), scrubbed the walls, and I can continue. Everything I was told to do, I did. I don't smoke and I'm never on my phone. I decided after all those hours, to sit down and eat for 5 minutes after the owner who was there said I can. The owner goes out to smokes, and the manager sees me eating and says \"Wtf, what do you think you are doing? Are you done cleaning? Who said you can sit down?\" I ignored him, I felt if I would open my mouth, I wouldn't say anything nice. One minute later he says to me - \"Are you ignoring me? Are you deaf?\" I reply by saying that -'he owner said it was okay for me to eat my food.\" He replies saying that \"The owner is not the manager on duty, you always do whatever you want.\" He tells me \"Go home.\" I told him - \"My shift ends at 9:00 P.M.\" I get up and go to the back to deep clean the dish pit area. I start with the dishes because I get nauseous from the smell of bleach which we use almost half a gallon when cleaning the floors in the back. He comes to the back saying again -\"Wtf, are you doing? Do you not see that the floors are dirty?\" I start replying by explaining why I started from the dishes first and while replying, he interrupts me by saying - \"Why are you talking back to me? Did I tell you to say anything? You always do what you want.\" Before I have anything to say, he raises his voice at me saying that \"I don't need you anymore. Go home.\" With not even 15 dollars in my pocket, he's telling me to go home. \n\nI couldn't even be upset because I was so mad. I go to the owner, saying \"I'm not leaving. After cleaning the entire day and 7 deliveries, it is not fair for me to be sent home.\" After having a talk with the both of us, he promised to have a talk with him and that I can come back later to work. It seemed to be okay for a week and then he started to show his true self again. \n\nThe third major and final encounter started with the recipe of how to make a certain sauce. Of course, he starts raising his voice, and I told him - \"Stop yelling at me.\" He replies with \"Don't talk back to me.\" We just go back and forth with that, until I tell him - \"Your position, doesn't give you the right to treat employees as if they are dogs.\" \"Do you think I'm stupid?\" I know you treat me like this only when nobody is around.\"He replies with \"Stop making things up.\" \"Do you know how many people like you were here? But I'm still here.\" Still, yelling in my face, I reply with \"If I recorded this, you understand how you treat people is against the law.\" With that phrase he made a face and left. That was it for me. I took my deliveries with me and as soon as I closed the door to my vehicle, I cried. I'm not sure if it were because I was disappointed or because I was upset or just tired; probably all three. I gave my two weeks, while understanding that he won, that he got what he wanted and that was to break me.",

        "text": "Lmao, this is my last story worthy post of my experience with pizza. I hope you guys got some form of enjoyment out of them. \n\nOkay, this story is actually set at my house. I have quite a small rent house and our porch lights are broken. Now, to set the scene i want you to imagine a small house, it's dark out the front, there is a hedge in front of the porch so there is hardly any street lights giving light. My cat, a small Blue Burmese, was kicked out earlier that night for scratching up carpets or something, and she was in a skitty mood. So she was desperate to get back inside, and when anyone approaches the door, she bolts up to the fly screen and gets as close to the door as possible. The pizza guy arrived so she must have bolted up to the door. She is a dark grey and very hard to see, she makes no sound. I'm sitting in the front room so i heard the pizza arrive so i'm quick to the door. I open it up and my cat is startled by the loud door sound 0.5mm from her face, she turns around and sprints back towards the pizza guy. This poor delivery man almost has a heart attack from the light speed grey thing running at him from the darkness. I distinctly remember seeing his hands leap to his face as he drops the pizza heater-bag-thing onto my cat, she gets slAMMED by 4 pizza's weight and turns around and bolts into my house. The delivery guy was still spooked from the fright and feels TERRIBLE for dropping our pizza and especially onto my cat. We assure him that she's fine and the pizza was fine as well, we tip him $20 and tell him not to worry. My cat has been shot in the shoulder by a slug gun, hit by a car AND had 4 pizzas dropped on her, and just walks it all off. She is an ultimate bad ass. \n\nTL;DR Cat scares pizza delivery man, he reacts by accidentally dropping 4 pizzas onto it. Gets a tip and a funny story to tell. ",

        "text": "Hey, this is the second story i have from having pizza delivered to me. \n\nThis time, i'm in Melbourne on a holiday with my family. We are in a hotel and are on the 16th floor. I am NOT a city person. We expected them to bring it into the building or something like on that suite life of Zach and Cody show lmao. But they don't do that, instead they texted us and said 'We are out the front of the building, your pizza is here' or something along those lines. I was a bit disappointed because i had just had a shower and was in my pyjamas and socks, but i walked down nevertheless. I arrived at the front of my hotel, but couldn't see anyone. So i walked around the other side of the hotel, only to notice that there was an alleyway around the back of the hotel. It's really dark, and i'm a small, timid, inland guy. I see about 4 cars and 3 of them have some sketchy looking guy standing next to their boot. I walk up to the first guy, who appeared to be in some form of uniform similar to a pizza place back at my home town. I get within 1 metre and all he says is 'What?' in an aggressive tone, i guessed that wasn't the pizza guy. I walked further down the alley to this guy with a turban sort of thing on his head, strong accent (can't pick it). He has a beat up, rusted old shitbox for a car. He has these cold eyes and he just stares at me, so i ask 'Are you from Crust?' (the pizza company i ordered from). He replies with 'yeah'. 'Gluten free Peri Peri chicken and Tandoori chicken and Garlic prawn pizza?' i asked him, he says 'yeah'. Note this guy was being super unhelpful and it was cold and raining and i wanted to go back inside, so i got quite agitated with this guys attitude. He asks what name the order was under. I reply 'Karen' (my mother's name). He denies it and says 'This is not your order, this is for a 'Sharron.' I argue and say i'm almost 100% certain that it is our order. Exact same order, same location, with a 1 sound difference between the order names. I suggested that the lady who took our order misheard my mother's name. He denies this as well. I'm fuming at this point, i'm standing in an alleyway on a rainy night, wearing nothing but banana socks and some angry birds pyjamas arguing with a man over whether or not my mother's name is Sharron or Karen. He eventually gives in and hands me the pizza, I give him the money and before he leaves he says 'If you go in that door there, it will take you to an elevator you can use to go to your floor.' I turn around and i see a glass door that needs one of the hotel key-card things, i say thank you and have a good night, and walk into the door to the elevator only to find that every door leads to a fire safety room, no elevators in sight. I walk back outside and the guy is gone. I returned to my room and the pizza was shit, i didn't even sleep that night.\n\nTl;DR pizza guy fucks with me for ages and wastes my time some more, terrible pizza, sleepless night.",
