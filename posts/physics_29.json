Something must be there right?\n\nSo if I have 2 locations that have nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, not 1 particle of anything, nothing at all. \n\nWhy is there a distance between those locations?\n\nIf there was nothing at all in a space, friction would be zero so to move any object would always result in a velocity greater than 0\n\nHow much energy would it take to make a black hole to compress that space? obviously knowing actually how much energy is possible but would it be significantly less?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/102mtl1/how_can_i_build_this_emfempe_shielding_device/",
        "text": "Hey everybody I came across this article about a shielding device I'm trying to create and I'm having a tough time understanding how this works mechanically or physically. if anybody's able to translate this into laymans or possibly link a video that sheds some light on the concepts outlined it would be outstanding. The device is outlined as follows\n\nFigure 2: (A) ELFm-EMPe Shield Device Block Diagram. Earth/Atmosphere are energy sources for polluting emissions (I, II). Neutrinos are space energy source of energy for bio-proton detectors (V). The human (III) is the target for these three sources of energy. (B) In the block diagram, IV, VI, VII, VIII, and IX are components of the Shield Device. VI and VII are armbands. IV, VIII, and IX are housed in a metal pen housing and electrically shielded inside from EMPe effects. The solid lines represent conventional EM wiring and coupling. The dashed lines represent scalar wave pathways, and virtual flux pathways.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Shield Device which Protects an Individual from the Negative Biological and Psychological Effects of EMPe and ELFm Polluting Emissions ~\n\nReference to Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the Shield Device. There are three components of the Shield Device. The first component is the metal shielded circuit made up of three parts respectively labeled: the Sensor (IV), the Battery (VIII), and the Controller (IX), a quartz clock. Now it is to be noted that the first component which is in the form and shape of a ball point type of pencil, and will be called the pencil hereinafter, encloses all of the three parts in a metal Faraday type of shield. This means that the the parts are effectively shielded against all EM radiation above about 100 Hz. The pencil is normally held in the hand and can be used as a working ballpoint pen, or it can be worn in a shirt pocket or carried by a cord hung around the neck. The only signals that can get through the shielding of the pen are: (a) the magnetic brain waves of the person wearing it, (b) the ambient neutrino flux from deep space, and (c) virtual sub-quantum anenergy from the environment.\n\nSignal (a) is obvious and needs no further explanation. The brain wave magnetic vector enters the Sensor IV, and is picked up by flat copper braid which is wound in 21 turns on a brass spindle, and each turn is rotated, or twisted 180° on each turn. This rotates the magnetic wave 180 degrees on each turn, and passes on the next turn a magnetic wave that is 180° out of phase with it. The result is that the vectors cancel each other, and the only wave that passes up to the coil is a scalar longitudinal wave. For a definition of the meaning of this term see Reference 6, pp. 21-25. The scalar wave, when it reaches the positive pole of the battery will orthorotate 180° and release a pulse of charge into the battery that is 180° out of phase with the pulse charge that has just left the battery at the negative pole. This phase control of battery charge emission, and battery charge entrance is managed by the oscillations of the quartz crystal in the clock which is free-running at 256 Hz. The proof of this action is that a battery with a normal life, with load, of one year will last for at least 4 years by our latest measurements, if not longer.\n\nBut there is a feedback between the human body, and the first component, the pencil, which has just been described. There is a second component, labeled in Figure 2 as the Magnetic Tape Loop (VI), Twistor and Antenna. This is made up of a plastic film (0.125 inch wide and 0.001 mil thick) coated on one side with magnetite powder (Fe3O4). The plastic film is wound on a sheet iron base in the form of a circle that will pass over a person’s hand and wrist, and is worn as a bracelet. There are 42 turns of the film on the metal circle, and the film is twisted 180 degrees each turn, The magnetic tape loop cancels all the magnetic vectors of all the frequencies  of EMPe and ELFm in the ambient environment, and cancels them by the phase canceling already described for the pencil. The difference is that the magnetic tape loop is not connected to anything --- it is an open circuit, and the scalar longitudinal waves are dumped into the ambient vacuum. When the first component, the pencil, is in skin contact with the person, some of the scalar longitudinal waves will enter part IV of the pencil.\n\nThe mechanism of this latter effect is that the quartz resonator IX has a feedback to the Copper Band VII of virtual photonic energy because the skin is a detector for all kinds of waves. See Reference 5, pp. 23-27 for a description of this detector effect discovered by the inventor. This copper band initiates a loop of virtual energy flow as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2 starting at IX, going to VII through the skin and to the opposite arm where it emerges 180° out of phase with the entrance signal due to the diode property of the skin, the path then goes through the shield into Sensor IV, and by hard wire circuitry back to the Controller IX. This is a complete circuit path in which a part of the path is hard-wired, and a part of the path is a scalar wave, and virtual photon, in nature. These different parts of the circuit, i.e., the human body, and the three components of the Shield Device come into a self-sustaining resonance. The virtual parts of the circuit are hyper-spatial, i.e., greater than 4 dimensions, and this is proven by the fact that the space in which the detector coil sits will remain clear of EMPe and ELFm for 15 minutes to 90 minutes after the person who wears the Shield Device leaves the area by going at least one-half mile away.\n\nReference to Figure 3 will show a series of typical measurements made in the region of the Detector Coil (2 in Figure 1) before and after the introduction of the Shield Device. The persistence of a hyperspatial effect is seen in a comparison between Figure 3A and Figure 3c when the person with the shield Device leaves the ELF Detector Coil region, and goes away at a distance of one-half mile. The pattern recorded by the ELF Detector Coil remains as shown in Figure 3C. It is to be noted by reference to the chart on page 20 in Exhibit E, that the beneficial frequencies for the human organism are centered on 8 Hz, and reference to Figure 3d shows that the Shield Device on a person centers his EEG power spectrum on this center frequency at a very high amplitude. This protects the person from polluting emissions and magnifies the natural NMR system of the biological system. See Reference 7 for an introduction to this NMR coupling.\n\nHere's the original link that displays all referenced figures\n\nhttp://rexresearch.com/puharelf/puharich.htm\n\n\nThank you in advance",

I actually intuited this long ago, but haven't thought about it too much until recently.  Since I don't care too much about whether it's the case or not, it hasn't been much of a priority for me.\n\nThe other day I heard a YouTuber or podcaster talk about his case for determinism, and how any \"randomness\" wouldn't affect it.  I was thinking he might be referring to chaos theory, which I have considered in the past.  I refreshed my knowledge of the basics, and it seems that there's no randomness assigned to any part of it.  Did I get that right?\n\nI handwaved (in my mind, hehe)  about the Uncertainty Principle, but it's only about relationships between particle properties and includes no random elements.  Is that correct?\n\nI mean, if there IS such a thing as \"randomness\".\n\nIs there anything wrt subatomic particles/string theory that could affect determinism?  \n\nIf the jury is still out on this hypothesis, could you kindly point me to a source or two that's freely available?

        "text": "I have always been confused about the efficiency of windmills and other machines that store kinetic energy as potential energy. For example, take a child’s pinwheel that spins when it is blown on with very little friction. Now I can imagine attaching a rubber band to the axle that winds as the pinwheel is blown adding tension like a spring that will result in kinetic energy as the rubber band unwinds later.  If I imagine a very thin rubber band, the pinwheel will still spin very freely. The rubber band would slow it only slightly until very many rotations of the rubber band have occurred.   In this case it would seem like very little of the wind is being converted to potential energy, at least with each revolution, at least until the rubber band is very twisted \n\nOn the other hand if I use a very thick rubber band the pinwheel will barely move at all and the rubber band will barely be twisted. But it might still result in a similar amount of potential energy because the thicker rubber band would have more torque. (Forgive me if I am using physics terminology incorrectly). In the extreme, if the rubber band was so strong the pinwheel didn’t move at all, then it would seem like none of the energy is being stored. Maybe the wind that is being blocked by the pinwheel results in turbulence that somehow becomes partially heat energy.  \n\nAnyway, seems like there is some sweet spot in between, so you would want pinwheels and windmills to move not entirely freely but not so much resistance that they stop.  Are there equations that describe this?",

        "text": "I understand that if one thing is moving at close to light speed relative to something else that is moving little, the one moving at close to the speed of light experiences a time slow-down - if it were to look at a clock held by the item moving little that clock would be ticking very, very fast from its point of view (and a clock held by the fast moving item would look to be ticking very slow to the slow moving item).\n\nQuestion - let's say in the entire universe there are only those two items described above - how on Earth (lol) would \"the universe\" determine which is moving fastly relative to the other?  From any point of view, they would be approaching each other, or moving away from each other, very quickly, but it would seem impossible to tell which is moving relative to the other.  How does the \"universe\" \"know\" which one really has the relatively fast motion and thus which clock should be running fast and which slow?\n\nRelated question - I've always heard that relativity theory says basically that space is not an absolute - there is no \"ether\" for example.  Space is not its own thing per se, but just describes relationships between different objects or other things.  If that were the case, my question above would seemingly be valid.\n\nBut I distinctly remember listening to an audiobook some time ago that seemed to say that the motion of objects in the universe was actually RELATIVE to spacetime.  This seemed weird to me, like almost inconsistent with everything I had ever heard (or thought I had heard).  But, if that is right, then the \"universe\" should not have a problem determining which particle was doing the (fast) moving and which one was not.\n\nIs what I heard right or wrong?\n\nThanks!",

The following lesson he said we should use biot-savart to find the magnetic field when working with objects that are finite or objects that ar half infinite (think of a cable that starts somewhere but never ends). Can someone confirm this and explain why please ?  \n\n\nTo be honest I'm also confused as to what both laws represent. I was told that ampère's law was the equivalent of Gauss' Law and Biot-Savart's law was the equivalent of Coulomb's law, but for magnetic fields. I would thus conclude that ampère's law has something to do with magnetic flux and biot-savart's law with magnetic force, but I don't really see a link. It's still abstract for me.",

Well if we combine the Multiple Big Bang theory which states that before this universe there had been many infinity on count others, can we assume that right now there are other universes such as in the Multi-verse theory because our universe doesn't really need to disappear in order to have other Big Bangs outside it. Like, what if outside our universe there are other Big Bangs that are happening and making new universes? \n\n*Just a thought tho, i will say it again it will probably bullshit so* ***don't flame me*** *;O*",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/101b32r/do_jwst_images_challenge_an_expanding_universe/",
        "text": "This question has been asked and answered a lot, with the answers always seemingly avoiding the arguments for why this is suggested in the first place. This is no good. And I wanted to try and rectify that here as best I can.\n\nSo, do the JWST images challenge an expanding universe? Well the answer is, that when interpreted in a certain context, yes, they do. I want to go over this context here. It's very straight forward, but has seen little to no discussion.\n\nin 1930, Richard Tolman Proposed a way to test, independent of any other assumptions and models, purely using basic GR, whether the redshift-distance relation was caused by expansion.\n\nIn normal Euclidian space, as an object gets further way in space, and its intrinsic size stays the same, you will observe that object to get smaller in apparent size. If that object is a light source, its light spreads out with distance, but it's apparent size shrinks. These two effects cancel out, and overall, the Surface brightness of the object stays constant as a function of distance.\n\nIn an expanding universe, things change. Over a redshift of about z=1.25, objects that maintain the same intrinsic size, no longer shrink with increasing distance, but actually grow in apparent size. This results in their surface brightness rapidly dropping off with distance (there's another effect that adds to this one, but it's not that important).\n\nSo, we have those two different predictions: in a normal Euclidean space, we expect to see surface brightness of luminous objects remain constant with distance. In an expanding spacetime, we expect to see the surface brightness of objects decrease rapidly as a function of distance.\n\nIn fact, this expectation of a rapidly dimming surface brightness as a function of Z is why most astrophysicists did not expect Hubble to see anything when pointed at a patch of black space.\n\nSo, what do we see when we do these tests? Well, at face value, we see exactly what we would expect to see in a normal Euclidean space with no expansion; galaxies all have the same surface brightness, independent of distance. Just like how we saw huge amounts of galaxies when we pointed Hubble at a patch of black space.\n\nOkay, so what's going on here? Why have you not heard of this significant falsification of one of the foundational assumptions of standard cosmology (that the redshift-distance relation is caused by expansion)? Well, you can get around this problem by treating the angular size of galaxies as a variable, and saying that, they grew in intrinsic size over time (but not necessarily mass), in just a way that cancelled out the expected effects of the Tolman test for expansion. So they actually are getting rapidly dimmer in apparent surface brightness at higher distances, but, they are also getting rapidly smaller in intrinsic size, cancelling out the growth in apparent size you expect from expansion. The results being that these effects cancel out, and that we are left with what looks like at face value a static universe with no expansion; but it's actually an expanding universe with a very specifically tailored galaxy evolution, so the argument goes.\n\nOkay, this is a little convenient, but lets put that aside for the moment. Why does JWST challenge an expanding universe then? Well, because, and no cosmologist will deny this: assuming the images are confirmed, they completely blow out of the water the kinds of galaxy evolution models that we were already working with; the kinds that were required to explain away the Tolman surface brightness tests that otherwise show a static universe at face value.\n\nYou can read into this further in this paper, section 2.5, Tolman tests. \n\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Tests-and-Problems-of-the-Standard-Model-in-L%C3%B3pez-Corredoira/804c6fc2ec44623c2505a9796a29ea3f068f5946",

        "text": "So am doing some revision for third year UK uni relativity course and Kruskal-Szerkes coordinate diagrams got me thinking about escaping a blackhole. Please forgive me if this is explained badly.\n\nLittle bit of background for my question:\n\nGluons and vacuum fluctuations both make pretty heavy use of the Energy-Time form of Heisenberg uncertainty.\n\nAnd vacuum fluctuations are the spontaneous creation and destruction of particles in a vacuum, as dictated by the uncertainty mentioned above.\n\nUnsure if this needs mentioning but for completeness: black holes have an event horizon which is the closest a photon can be from a black hole and still escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the question:\n\nSay you're like just inside the event horizon and a vacuum fluctuation happens, creating a virtual particle with a radial path out from the black hole. It has already made use of (Delta)E(Delta)t &gt;= h/4\\*pi\n\nbut say we look at an even smaller scale of time from normal, is it not possible for this virtual particle to momentarily exceed usual limits of particle energy to escape?\n\nI get that usually its impossible but surely the uncertainty means that on a short enough time-scale there can be enough energy present.\n\nWhile writing this I've had the thought that its more of a 'infinite energy =&gt; infinitesimally small amount of time' but figured id still post in case anyone finds this interesting or has anything else to add :)",
