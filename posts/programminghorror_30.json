        "text": "Some people in /r/talesfromtechsupport said I should post this story here, so here goes.\n\nWhenever I needed our office address, I would pull up the corporate homepage to find the address and zipcode of our office. I make heavy use of tabs in my browser, and since I use a vertical tab plugin, I rarely close any.\n\nI had noticed that my browser would sometimes slow down to a crawl, and I knew it was probably some shitty plugin in one of my many open tabs, it was usually less work to just close the browser and re-open it, discarding all open tabs and starting anew.\n\nOne day, I had pulled up the homepage again to copy the address, and after that went to lunch. An hour later, I was doing some work that didn't involve my browser. The door to our room opened.\n\n\"That's him, over there,\" a coworker told some guy I hadn't seen before, giving me somewhat of a stink eye.\n\nIt turns out that the corporate homepage was experiencing a DOS attack that originated from within the company, more specifically my laptop. Meanwhile, some bottlenecks in our corporate network also got swamped with my laptop's calls, setting off all kinds of alarms and crashing stuff. This is not a small company by the way, it employs 1000s of people.\n\nI pulled up my browser and it was slower and less responsive than I'd ever seen it. So, putting the puzzle pieces together, I said: \"ah, so that's what's been slowing my browser down.\" Guy said: \"yeah that's really interesting, would you mind closing it like right now??\" \"sure.\" So I closed the browser, instantly alleviating a corporate-wide IT crisis.\n\nI wanted to know what exactly had happened though, so a couple of days later I had some free time and pulled up the corporate homepage again, and used the firebug net monitor. It seemed fine at first, but I started noticing a pattern pretty quickly.\n\nOne minute after I opened it, it made an ajax call to the server. I looked into it, and it was to update the stock price in real-time that was displayed in a tiny area on the homepage.\n\nOne minute later, it made two calls to the same service. Another minute later, it made four calls, next, eight calls, sixteen calls, and so forth. e: after writing this, I've calculated that after an hour, it would attempt to send 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 simultaneous calls. I believe that's called a Quintillion.\n\nIn Javascript, a common way to repeatedly trigger a delayed execution is to use setTimeout at the end of the function you want to repeatedly trigger. Example (that I added to comply with the rules of this subreddit):\n\n    function doStockQuote() {\n        var json = doAjaxCall();\n        updateStockQuote(json);\n\n        setTimeout(\"doStockQuote\", 60000);\n    }\n\nThe problem was, for some reason, there were two setTimeouts at the end of the function, like this: \n\n    function doStockQuote() {\n        var json = doAjaxCall();\n        updateStockQuote(json);\n\n        setTimeout(\"doStockQuote\", 60000);\n        setTimeout(\"doStockQuote\", 60000);\n    }\n\n\nSo, after a minute delay, it would execute the function twice, and both executions would hit two setTimeouts, resulting in four executions a minute later.\n\nWhat makes this interesting to me is that anyone on the internet could pull up the homepage, and cause huge problems by just doing nothing. I wrote an e-mail to the people responsible. Didn't get an answer, but it did get fixed.",

        "text": "I used to work in a combo wet/computational biology lab. Basically we did all our own experiments and then analyzed our own data. I was the tech and worked with new grad students, etc. One of the new guys had never programmed before so I went over the basics with him, made him a cheat sheet/tutorial on R, and away he went. He rarely asked coding-related questions of us despite there being 3 much more experienced programmers in the room, so I thought he was doing fine. (As a disclaimer, I had only had introductory C++ background and taught myself R as part of this job. Also, this guy was/is a Harvard grad student so I assumed he could handle himself.)\n\nA few months later I was working on his project with him and started to realize he'd developed ridiculously bad coding habits. They were so bad I could not have anticipated them (I tried to give him a good basic understanding, I really did). So I started fixing his code/sending him my own code for him to use.

        "text": "A few years ago I was asked to help out with the code for a fairly ambitious game mod / level pack. The game supported a scripting language that resembled C, but without many complicated things like pointers. Each level could have a source file associated with it, and there was also support for shared libraries.\n\nOf course, this project was not using any shared libraries. Each level had several thousand lines of code. Most of the levels shared most of their code via copy+paste, but with lots of little modifications. Source control? Revision history? Not used of course.\n\nBesides having functions, the language had \"scripts\" which could be thought of as running in their own threads concurrently. If you attempt to start a script that was already started, the call would silently fail, so naturally the original programmer didn't worry too much about the control flow. *The HUD control scripts need to start up sometime after the enemy init scripts? Call it after that. But just in case the enemy init scripts don't work or don't get called, also try to start the HUD scripts over here too. And hell, since it doesn't hurt let's start it over here too.* I was very confused when I disabled the HUD script call (so I could focus on fixing other parts of the code for the moment) and found it still running. Multi-threaded cyclic spaghetti code, yay. I haven't even mentioned how many of the scripts were inter-dependent on the same global variables. And don't forget that there were 30 subtly different versions of this code.\n\nAt first I decided to try to go through all of the code and fix it up as I went. A week later I gave up and decided to delete all of the code and re-write it from scratch (finishing 90% of the functionality in 24 hours), but before that, there was a certain often-recurring pattern in that code that burned itself into my mind.\n\n    for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i++) {\n      switch(i) {\n        case 0:\n          ...\n          break;\n        case 1:\n          ...\n          break;\n        case 2:\n          ...\n          break;\n        default:\n          ...\n      }\n    }\n\nI spent a while trying to figure out if there was some secret to the above code I was missing. The i variable was only used in that switch statement! The for and switch statements added nothing to the code.\n\nEventually I found a similar less-recurring pattern that did something with the i value. I could see that the code worked and did something specific that the control structures aided, but I can't imagine the mind that would decide that this was the optimal way to do it. I guess when all you have is ~~a hammer~~ the for-switch pattern, everything looks like a nail.\n\n    while (true) {\n      for (int i=0; i&lt;2; i++) {\n        switch(i) {\n          case 0:\n            ...\n            break;\n          case 1:\n            ...\n            if (some condition) {\n              break;\n            } else {\n              i = 2;\n            }\n          case 2:\n            ...\n        }\n      }\n      delay(1);\n    }\n\nDo note that the programmer made the for-loop never run the loop with i=2, but managed to discover fall-through to the next case. Not that the case was ever directly called or necessary...",

        "text": "I'm designing a genetics system for a game as part of one of my uni course's modules. Since each type of gene would act similarly, but hold a different data type, I decided that a generic base class set to a concrete type by each derived class would be appropriate. **However**, all the genes are to be held in a single List, but since List is also generic it requires a type parameter (which is the base gene class, but then **that** also requires a type parameter) which limits the list to one type of gene only.\n\nMy solution, was to have the generic base class implement an interface (which would be the type parameter of the List), which has a generic function to get the gene's dominant value. Which, because the type parameter in the interface and the one in the base class are technically separate, leads to this monstrosity of a function:\n\n    public GeneTyp GetDominantValue&lt;GeneTyp&gt;()\n    {\n        if (typeof(Typ) != typeof(GeneTyp)) return default(GeneTyp);\n\n        if(GetDominance(value1) &gt;= GetDominance(value2))\n            return (GeneTyp) (object) value1;\n        else\n            return (GeneTyp) (object) value2;\n    }\n\nThis works, but it just feels *wrong*. Any help with sorting this out would be appreciated.",

This Wednesday, our project manager received an e-mail from our intermediary, who were conducting tests of our application, that it doesn't work.

She had already posted on the [Mantis](http://www.mantisbt.org/) how they should have configured the application, so she believed it has to be some mysterious bug in the application. She spent several hours trying to reproduce the error, with no results.\n\nShe finally logged into intermediary's test server, to see what's wrong. The logs indicated that the application failed while trying to connect to intermediary's security provider server. She quickly glances into the configuration and found this gem (here paraphrased):\n\n    security.provider= http://security.intermediary.com/something [^]\n\nYes, Mantis adds `[^]` after every URL and they just simply copied and pasted it into the config, thinking it's the part of URL.

        "text": "Years ago, I took my first computer science class. The class used Javascript and had a final group project that involved building a website with significant scripted components. This was a summer course, so the timeframe from start to finish was about three weeks.\n\nI was feeling artistic, so I decided to do something graphical and musical. I was enthusiastic enough about the project that I convinced the other group members to go with my idea and did all the work. It was an interactive keyboard piano, with an animated animal mascot. I'd decided from the start that I wouldn't use any images, so I did everything in CSS and Javascript.\n\nBefore that class, my only programming knowledge was limited to a rather superficial understanding of C, from dabbling in MUDs. I knew about values and pointers, and had vague notions that arrays and pointers were related. I didn't know much about arrays. What little I knew about C led to a lot of conceptual misunderstandings.\n\nSince Javascript apparently lacked pointers, I figured everything was a value type. This led to a lot of paranoia and confused sidestepping in code. The idea of reference types was unknown to me, so I was always nervous about object assignment, since everything clearly had to be copied. Even worse, I had no way of cleaning up all that wasted memory! That stressed me out.\n\nAt some point, I lost that inhibition and was happily wasting memory everywhere. It was clear Javascript had some black magic voodoo going, so I might as well make good use of it.\n\nI decided I wanted random music to go with the project, since the class was looking at algorithms and generative art then. I stumbled across [Musikalisches Würfelspiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel), and managed to brute-force a working implementation within the final week.\n\nWork on the project was done iteratively. Things were written in Notepad, and the webpage was then refreshed to see if they worked. Debugging was mostly a spray'n'pray affair.\n\nAt one point, there were some very persistent error messages that bugged me to no end. I then discovered the wonders of exception mishandling... I included exception swallowing in the final report as one of the valuable things I got out of the project.\n\n**TL;DR**: War. War never changes.\n\nLink: https://gist.github.com/3747539",

Fun ensued. \n\nThey will probably sue me now on the basis of some fucked up NDA I signed as a naive minor. Let me remind you lawyers, innocent, manipulable virgin minor with headgear and braces. \n\nRAINMAN stood for \"Remote Access Information Manager\" but what it really meant was that there was a slow-ass server somewhere that took actual pseudo SMTP messages from a bizarre coding/gui interface (closest thing I can think of is if Dreamweaver were made by the 1992 MS Word team) that \"submitted\" your \"code\" VIA FUCKING EMAIL to be compiled on said shitty-slow pentium i486 in Texas or some shit. \n\nTen minutes later you'd get a list of compile errors in your AOL Account Inbox because your \"screen name\" was passed through the shitty in-AOL IDE to the server VIA FUCKING EMAIL! No, really, the only way to code for AOL was to login, click on the \"page\" you wanted to edit, have some manager add you to an access list and fuck up like 5 times because THEY'RE EMAILING A SERVER TO GRANT PRIVILEGES.\n\nHow many times do I have to say you compiled your code by EMAILING A FUCKING SERVER! It's a trade secret because patenting that shit would just make you go to prison.\n\nThis is what wikipedia says about AOL Rainman: \n\nRainman code is kept strictly confidential by AOL; access is granted at their discretion.\n\nBECAUSE IT IS EMBARRASSING, NOT BECAUSE THE TRADE SECRET WILL GET YOU LAID.

Well, Mike does not have a degree in CS or any related field (though he did one semester of CS courses). He was hired for a six month project to work on the database for out application (not sure why we need a person in charge of the database for six months as I know MySQL enough to get by).\n\nI am in charge of writing the entire web site. My boss realized that he didn't need someone working on the database for six months so he asked this guy to take some responsibilities from me. He doesn't know PHP (the language in which I chose to write the website) but he knows a little bit of Python (given his beginning CS course a few semesters ago). My boss decides he should write the video trimmer. PHP and Python aren't exactly the best languages to do video editing with so he chose to use subprocesses in Python to run ffmpeg. He told me it could only make forty-five clips. This baffled me but I shrugged my shoulders and moved on.\n\nSince he chose to do this, I told him I would port it to PHP. It'd make much more sense to do that. He warned me about it being nearly 9,000 lines of code. Python? Seriously? Why would this take 9,000 lines in Python? I bet a b****fuck implementation would be shorter than this. So I open up the file to begin the porting process and soon realize why it can only do forty-five clips.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/3307369",

        "text": "I recently worked as a VB.net / ASP.Net developer and took over a project for a small internal web application. \n\nNow I was given a spec with the requirements for the next version and 8 weeks to make the required changes, didn't seem too bad as the changes weren't too huge, just some basic extra functionality.\n\nI sit down to look at this project and start looking through the code, first thing I notice is it is full of inline SQL, no stored procs and some places where there were vulnerabilities to injection attacks. Next up the 4 main ASP.Net pages each take 6 seconds to load. \n\nSo warning bells are ringing here, the application is a pain in the ass for its users in its current state. I refuse to do any of the changes without taking 2 weeks first to fix these performance issues, and only then would I start making the required changes.\n\nSo I go through and rewrite all the SQL into stored procedures, removing the injection attack vulnerabilities as I go.   But doing this I find that the database queries are built on views,  views querying views joined to views etc, Im pretty picky about the execution time of my SQL so I decide to rewrite more of the queries and rip out the views, Whilst I'm working on all these procedures I decided to implement a little logging code, so i write up a basic template for all my stored procs that inserts the start / end time of each proc execution into a table for later review.\n\nI get the project running a bit faster, nowhere near good but I assume the 3rd party control we are using is just memory hungry and leave it at that, I start making the changes and have the application running on my testing server for about a week with only myself using it. One day I think to check out my logging table to see what has gone in there.  What I find shocked me, two procs had been called 8000 times each in the space of a week, the 3rd proc on the list was only at 150 calls!!  \n\nSo I dig into this and find where the procedure is being called, its a piece of code triggered by an event from the custom control we are using, its not commented, I kinda skipped over it cause it didn't seem to be doing anything major. I decide to see what this thing actually does and comment it out, then I try running the code and find our 6 second page load time has now gone to less than a second!\n\nSo what did the code do that had caused 6 users to work full time for over a year with an application that took 6 seconds to load pages?  It drew a green vertical line on a calendar control....... One green line had accounted for 90% of the poor performance issues of this entire piece of software.\n\n",

        "text": "I recently inherited a classic asp intranet website that manages quite a few facilities for the different departments that was originally built back in 2001. Access to the different sections of the site is granted by the IT department, as well as managing users and their passwords. To change a password, you pull up the user on a form, which has their name + password field to input a new password.\n\nUpon further inspection, it is filling that field with the users password, which is obviously stored in plaintext. Viewing the source of the page tells you what is in the field, the users live password. My favorite part of the source is at the top is a changelog with something to the effect of \"Hid users passwords\" which obviously must meant adding the type=password tag to the form.\n\nWell, it seems the guy who originally built it went out of his way to make this terrible decision a cornerstone of the websites design. Whenever you update anything about the user, you need to use this form, and the form always resubmits the password back to the system (basically it's changing itself to itself anytime you change any of the users details.) Even further, it seems all access is basically built around echoeing back that password over and over everywhere in the site.",

        "text": "At my previous job I was tasked with automating many wireless devices, usually without too many problems. That was until I encountered the Linksys e3000. I'm not removing names since this is a consumer model wireless router and I was using one purchased off the shelf. Presumably the following is still true.\n\nUnsurprisingly the consumer model had no API so I was left to automate its use with some other method. Fair enough. When I viewed the page source I found the following header at the top of every page and had my first encounter with what would become a miserable, frustrating, and soul-crushing exercise.\n\n    *********************************************************\n    *   Copyright 2003, CyberTAN  Inc.  All Rights Reserved \n    *********************************************************\n\n    This is UNPUBLISHED PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODE of CyberTAN Inc.\n    the contents of this file may not be disclosed to third parties,\n    copied or duplicated in any form without the prior written\n    permission of CyberTAN Inc.\n\n    This software should be used as a reference only, and it not\n    intended for production use!\n\nApparently Linksys outsourced software dev to [these guys](http://www.cybertan.com.tw/) in 2003 or something and have been shipping \"it not intended for production use\" code ever since. Moving on.\n\nThe forms, their possible values, and their current values were all populated with javascript text replacement. The javascript was spread between functions repeatedly defined in every page as well as a giant monstrosity of a master file. The possible values and value names changed between some but not all pages, even though they were for the same feature. Some of these values were defined twice, but one with a \"_\" prefix. Which one actually specified the correct value was apparently random and required trial and error to figure out.\n\nI remember having other issues with hidden fields that were filled out by javascript triggered when changing other fields. Submitting the new settings required **every** property be specified or the router would crash and require a hard boot of the entire device, so I had to go through every page, submit a bunch of possible combinations of data, and then look at the sent data to get the right values to include.\n\nThere was malformed HTML, huge blocks of commented code, numerous debug comments, and everything was poorly formatted. The best quote I found was something like \"Erin to fix this,\" which given its presence leads me to believe Erin didn't fix it.\n\nIt sucked, killed my spirit, and contributed to my desire to quite a few months later. Never again.\n\nI'm not the first to find this apparently. [This guy](http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/linksys-sucks-at-coding.htm) wrote up a similar report when dealing with the WRT54G3G.",

As I just posted elsewhere, first compile of the code the 3rd party delivered (company got code 2 days after I was hired) enlarged the folder to 1.8gbs, was about 900mb before.\n\nThese people were bad bad. They recommended silverlight and convinced our management long before I got there.\n\nSo a few months into things we want to implement a complex new feature to allow account nesting. UI side I said no problem. Was excited to do it. Back end said too much, which was reasonable.\n\nThey go to 3rd party. 3rd party says too much, scope is narrowed down. Our back end guy says \"I can handle that narrowed scope\". They go with the other guys anyway, after I had even said to them \"What you were given was so bad I consider it criminal.\" I meant that. The requirements that pretty much didn't exist only stipulated a architecture really. It wasn't followed at all. No DTOs, calls to server everywhere, bloated giant classes and methods (sometimes I'd find functions containing a inline function, that contained an inline function).\n\nThey really just didn't care.\n\nSo fast forward 2 months and after some issues they are pushing out their final stuff. The \"issues\" is a whole different thing.\n\nbut anyway it all gets resolved. And I am messing around in their new UI which isn't in our \"limited\" release yet. I need to check some data and that requires their newer stuff. I go in. No data. Ask manager who talked to them (sits next to me) and generally does testing to give me go-ahead if it was working fine on their version for us to see. Yep worked fine. Check that data is being received. Yes. Check that data is being put in the variable used for display. Yes. hmmmm. Go to the Xaml. Look for misspelled variable names because it will just fail silently.... ... what?\n\nThere was no variable listed. The grid was not given anything to access data with. A look through the repo shows it never did. I guess my manager just wished really hard then. Add variable. working okay (just displays text but sorting never worked for whatever reason... and they F-ed up my updating improvements. Namely that it would grab new data when navigating. Rather than all data at login and just assume its still good.). ",

        "text": "I took over a project a year ago in Silverlight (that isn't the horror part). The original programmer(s?) didn't do so hot. We are re-enabling an area that had been closed off due to lack of current functionality (back end didn't fully support it, and the front end was broken to all get out).\n\nWe are re-enabling it and found two values on one screen had reversed values. Easy enough fix. I look in the code and find these two lines. (Some stuff will be starred out for privacy etc. I didn't change the names because it would detract from the issue)\n\n    &lt;TextBlock Style=\"{StaticResource StatsTextStyle}\" Text=\"{Binding Path=Model.****ViewModel.****Overview.Number1, StringFormat=\\{0:n0\\}}\" /&gt;\n\nand then the other one\n\n    &lt;TextBlock Style=\"{StaticResource StatsTextStyle}\" Text=\"{Binding Model.****ViewModel.****Overview.Number2, StringFormat=\\{0:n0\\}}\" /&gt;\n\nHow could these two values that actually are indicating a value of data getting confused? They are *clearly* labeled. The first one goes first, then the second one is second. If only someone had realized that the second one was supposed to go along with the first position! How could they not realize the difference?!\n\nThe sad thing is I'm actually really happy they didn't call it Value. Normally its value, everything is labeled value. So what happens if I want to change the name of a variable named value? Well apparently in my project there are ~6000 matching lines with the whole word value. So I'd have to find the instance of it in code, find everywhere its used in xaml (keeping in mind their binding is inconsistently done, sometimes the containing class is not referenced at all in the xaml) and hand changes those. For those who don't do Silverlight, Visual Studio doesn't have the capacity to recognize a xaml variable is connected to a c# variable. Its DIY. There are only a couple references to Number1 and Number2 so this is something that I can potentially fix!\n\nThis is not uncommon stuff for me. I'll post more.\n\n**Update: They are switching to HTML! Notice I said they, not we! Luckily I had already started job hunting. No hard feelings about it considering I've been pushing for the change myself.**",

        "text": "As a preface, I should mention that I'm really, really bad at computers in general. I'm one of *those* people - electronics around me have a nasty habit of fizzing and dying at inopportune times. I am also, as I discovered when taking a few computer science at college, incredibly good at producing hilarious errors. \"Incldue\" may have come up a few times.\n\nBy far the strangest (while trying to troubleshoot) error I ever got was on I've always thought of as the Magic Comment. There was one particular function which ran through a data set (a list, I think; this was all in C++) looking for two values, then had two pointers point to them. For some reason, this function wasn't working, and I couldn't figure out why; it kept ending with one of the pointers pointing at gibberish. To troubleshoot, I ran through and added a couple of extra variables and printed them out while the function was running, so I could figure out where exactly it was breaking.\n\nThe problem was, it wasn't. After I added the extra variables, the function was working again. Baffled, I figured I'd retyped something somewhere and it was working, so I deleted all the testing code and ran it again. It stopped working.\n\nI was, understandably, baffled. I started in on my second tier of debugging: commenting out code to see what happened. I wasn't making any progress, until suddenly I found a single line of code that, if removed, made the function run properly. \n\nAs the title implies, this line was a comment. If I deleted the line, the code worked; if I added it back in, the code broke. I was using \"//\" for that line, so I wasn't accidentally adding a \"/*\" or anything like that; it was simply the presence or absence of the comment that determined if the code worked or not. At that point, I basically ragequit and handed my computer to the TA. He stared at it for a while, shrugged, handed it back to me and walked away laughing. I was not amused.\n\nEventually, with help from a friend of mine, I discovered the problem: I'd never set my pointers to null, which I guess was messing everything up. I was quite unhappy that it was such a simple, obvious error, but on the plus side I learned a valuable lesson: I should never ever ever try to write code.",

        "text": "Ok this is going to be long, so sit back, relax and don't chastise because I might miss a detail or three...\n\nSo over a year ago I got hired by the company I am working at now as the developer for the internal systems.  It is a huge responsibility and I love it.  When I was hired on I was told I would get no help because there are no other developers in the company.  I asked why not and the reply was that the original developers were on loan from a sister company (in the umbrella) but they will no longer work on our stuff.  They had 4 developers that I would be replacing.\n\nI thought that was pretty daunting but as long as things were documented, and logical, I shouldn't have too many problems.\n\nNo documentation on anything, the databases are a total mess, heck they didn't even have source code control.\n\nSo I knew I had a huge job ahead of me.  But that was ok, I needed a job, and to be honest, a year later, I am loving this place, despite the challanges.\n\nFast forward a year.  I am writing a system for a US client to match the system that we use for a Canadian client.   Our internal employees will be using the system, so I had to make it as close to the Canadian system as possible.  No problem I thought.  Some work was done already by the previous developers so I had a good start already.  I decided I would document the previous work as best I could, then put in stuff imported from the Canadian system to create the new US system.\n\nDid that, got a Tshirt and I autographed a piece of stationary and gave it to myself as a surprise.  Woo hoo.  For me???\n\nHow the system works in a nutshell is that the client sends an excel workbook of work they say their technicians are going to do.  I import that.  A few days later, they send another workbook with all of the exact tasks that the tech did on those jobs.  The information is confirmed etc.\n\nNow sometimes because they hire technicians without entering them into the HR system, when importing, no valid tech is found.  In those case we assign them to a generic default user and the people here will work it all out.  \n\nNow when this happens in the background, the workorder (job) is re-opened, a reason is assigned (Reassign To Tech).  The code is a bit more complicated.\n\nThe code looks at the typeid of the workorder (yeah I don't know what that means either).  Based on the typeid a reasonid is assigned.  ok now I have something, but nowhere in the interface is a reason selected.  So I asked one of the phone people how do you set the reason for re-opening a workorder to reassign a tech.\n\nShe said that on another form they can assign that information. I thought wonderful, I can look at the webpage source code and see how that dropdown is populated to get the data I need.\n\nSo the webpage has an include file.  I go to that include file and it refers to another include.  I go to that include in a different project.  It calls a javascript file that I can't find.  After sometime searching I found the javascript file.  I see how the reasons data is retrieved.  YIPPEE.\n\nI look in the table in the one database.  It has two fields that I do not know what they refer to (did i mention the database was not documented either)?  They are TAID and PID.  Hmmmm the numbers don't look obvious to anything so I look table by table for a TAID.  I find a table called ticket action, and the numbers jive.  Ok cool, one field taken care of.  I look for PID....partner id perhaps?  no partner table.  no table starting with P that is logical.\n\nI searcch all of the other databases (oh yeah there are about 20) and come up with nothing.\n\nSo I generate a script for all of the stored procedures in the main database and look for anything that uses the ticketreasons table.  I found a stored procedure that does, and look at the code.  It's main parameter is PID (still no wiser though).\n\nI now do a search in the webpage code looking for that stored procedure.  I FIND IT!!!  In code though the variable used to supply the PID is companyID.\n\nOf course this doesn't make sense....so I look back in the storedprocedure's code to see that company id is from a source table.  I remember that there is a companyID in the source table...that relates to (well doesn't relate, because you see the previous developers didn't believe in database relationships) the sourcecompanies table.  So I lood through the records, and find what I was looking for...the PID...\n\nSo I look back in the ticket reasons table for anything with that company id (sorry the PID) and it returns the record I need...of which I get the reason id, to hardcode (yeesh) into the webpage code.\n\nAll of this so I can reassign a workorder to a proper tech.\n\nAnd this is how most of my days are spent.  Travelling through a maze of spaghetti developing patience not to go postal on the previous developers.\n\nBefore anyone asks...no I have not had time to fully document everything, and no I haven't had time to create relationships in the table of the various databases (and there are lots of reasons why it is almost impossible now).\n\nSigh.\n\nTL;DL  I was given a plate of spaghetti and used it to make a ladder to climb to the sun, but Icarus flew by and knocked me off.",
