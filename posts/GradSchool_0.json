        "text": "Hello all, I am currently a junior at a university majoring in psychology. I just transferred in this semester from a CC so I am only taking my final math for my AA/the first math for my prereqs for my major, a graduation requirement course and a random elective. For the past year or so, I have been focused on completing my undergrad degree in psychology and going on to apply to clinical psych PhD programs. However, in the past few months I have started to consider switching that goal to a neuroscience PhD program. And even more recently, in the past few weeks, I have started to consider adding a masters in between there. \n\nIf I were to add a masters, it would purely be for learning purposes. I would want it to be something that would supplement my PhD and can help me in the job world, but I have no idea what I would want it to be. Possibly something like data science or statistics, however the issue with these two is the only math training I will probably have by the end of my undergrad degree is introductory stats and maybe precalc/calc 1. Thinking a little harder, the masters is really not necessary, but I probably should change my undergrad major... Neuroscience as a major is not offered. What are the benefits/cons to getting a masters before my PhD? Should it be in something practical, or something I'm passionate about? \n\nI guess what I'm asking is, what are the real job prospects for something like a STEM PhD? I am mainly interested in research that would actually help people, like furthering the advancement of psychiatric treatments, or doing research to help prevent and treat neurological diseases such as brain cancer, dementia, epilepsy etc. And I am also interested in neurodevelopmental disorders such ADHD and autism. I guess I started to think of neuroscience instead of psychology because of the fact that I like working with my hands and doing research and lab work. However, I also really like many aspects of psychology and would love to be either a pediatric clinical psychologist or a neuropsychologist. I want to work with kids and young adults. I'm very conflicted, as you can see! \n\nIf anyone has any words of wisdom on how I can choose what path to take, it would be greatly appreciated. Class registration for next semester is coming up soon so I've got to figure out what I'm doing now so that I can start to prepare in my schedule and change my major if need be. Thanks in advance",

I do it but I still find myself stammering over my words despite bring 10 weeks deep. Writing out word for word or even just summaries as to what to say has not helped my stammering or choppy explanations. I struggle for the life of me to think of a way to explain it that they can grasp. I don't get why they aren't understanding me. The material seems simple in my opinion. \n\nI got pretty shit mid semester ratings so I know its not just me being hard on myself. This isn't a great mentality I know but I also don't particularly care if they retain the information or not. It makes me feel bad that I don't take more pride in being a part of their educational journey but I would rather just be taking my classes or doing research. \n\nI also have a lot of trouble making my voice loud enough for them to hear. I really have absolutely zero interest in being the center of attention in any kind of setting. In social settings I am the quieter person and I have had a history in the past of turning my thoughts into words. \n\nAny tips to make it not feel painful? \n\nEnd career goals are industry for me.

I graduated back in 2021 with a bachelors in Human Geography with minors in Environmental Studies and GIS from UofT (I'm based in Canada). I'm currently working as a Research Analyst in Real Estate, observing regional construction trends, tenant movements, market trends, etc. Currently making 50K CAD but recently got a 15% raise which kicks in next month. I also have a student loan with ~15K left to pay off.\n\nI've been planning on applying to an Urban planning masters in Sweden in late 2023 or in 2024, with the intention of hopefully working in that country/region afterwards. Working in planning in some capacity has always been the goal for me, and specifically the Scandinavian countries/Sweden as they're among the most innovative as it concerns planning principles and sustainability from the conversations I've had with planners operating in the region. I also just think the region would be a decent place to work and live long-term, for various different reasons.\n\nAs such, I've been learning Swedish pretty intensively and have been stashing away cash to support myself during the potential masters - I currently have ~20K CAD saved up with the intention of saving up literally as much as I humanely can.\n\nLink√∂ping University's Strategic Urban and Regional Planning program is one which has caught my eye and would probably be my first choice - doesn't look too be terribly competitive with total tuition at 190,000 SEK (~$24,000 CAD). The most expensive program I've seen is at KTH Stockholm at 310,000 SEK (just over $40,000 CAD).\n\nMy question is if any of you think this is a realistic goal, both financially and career-wise. I recognize that I would be taking on student debt to finance this endeavour, while many people generally say that one should avoid paying out-of-pocket for their Master's Degree. \n\nThe alternative would be either forgoing a Masters in general or doing one in Canada, perhaps with the intention of going abroad later in life, which could be difficult without that local knowledge and connections if I stick to planning. \n\nThanks for any opinions!!",

Now, I already took a gap year and also moved back to the US in fall after completing my undergrad in my home country, so it's been hard to find jobs that work for me, and that I'm qualified for. I'm working as a part time teacher in an after school academy place but that's obviously not enough. I'm also looking for tutoring gigs so again, not a lot of money, and clearly it's not a company that can pay for grad school. Probably can't take a gap year again because if I did, I'd likely be working in minimum wage positions that can't help me save up enough. I'm lucky to be living with my parents so I don't have to worry about living costs or anything right now, but they can't afford to put me through grad school at all, especially out of state. \n\nI estimated the total cost and it'd probably be around at least $100k-$120k in loans (assuming I can get federal loans for living costs too?), so I'm currently dying. I do plan on applying for as many teaching/research assistantships as possible and hopefully getting them, but honestly that doesn't seem likely before at least a quarter or two, and I'm not even sure if those come with tuition remission or anything. \n\nSo logically, it seems like I shouldn't. And I know the general consensus is to not pay for a master's in math/applied math either. Except I legitimately can NOT get any jobs in the meanwhile that are relevant to my undergrad math degree or future applied math work, so it doesn't seem like that's a good option either. I won't be in a loss if I take a gap year but whatever I do save up will likely get spent on necessities and I still won't be able to pay with my savings for a master's. I also likely will not be qualified for a PhD still, so I can't just wait and then apply to a doctorate program.\n\nWhat's worse is I was planning on applying for a PhD after finishing my masters so that I could get a feel for + experience in research first, but if I take up this program, I'll likely just go straight into industry or teaching at a community college so that the loans don't add up too much. (But the good thing is that I'm starting to feel like I'd hate having to do research for a full 5 years because I don't think I have the capacity to read/work THAT much, and I was working on a research assistantship for 3 months which I had to stop because I moved continents, and I really did not enjoy it as much as i had hoped to.) \n\nOn the other hand though, UW has courses and research in so so many things I'm interested in and I really think I'd enjoy it. That, and I also hope the alumni network and reputation of the school might help me in getting/finding jobs in the industry. Educationally, it seems like honestly the best choice out of the grad schools I did apply to, so now I'm just very, very confused üò≠üò≠ \n\nDoes anyone have literally any advice üò≠üò≠üò≠ I have till April 15th to decide for this school, and I doubt I'm getting any other responses by then esp judging how last year's application cycle went lmao so this might be my only choice at all at this point üò∂\n\n(As a side question, if I did take out loans for this program, how do they work. I applied for the fafsa and was given an estimate of about $20k and I know I can take out plus loans as well, but like... how lmao. Do I have to talk to the school separately about how much I need? Even for living costs? Or is it automatic? Idk anything please help üò≠)",

I would be 1/3 grad students. My major concern is that cell culture always involves weekends and I would lack some of the lab culture lab 2 has, but i have an office with one other so no internal pressure about when im in lab.\n\nIn lab 2, only grad students, which is fun because I would have 2 other students in my cohort who I am friends with.

Program's pretty competitive to get accepted to ( 20 / 100+ ). Standed out to me when I applied since : we will be a cohort of students from across canada who'll be connected during the program. We'll have weekly workshops and seminars and meetups &amp; etc. , &amp; the program itself seems very well structured. \n\n\nCase 2) good supervisor , not so so active at the moment , hasn't been getting phenotypes of interest for a while so told me straight up don't expect much results. Seems like funding's down a bit. Very small lab and team. I applied for NSERC with him since he was my first offer &amp; I didn't wanna throw my chances in the toilet as the deadlines were close, after applying tho I got a couple more offers such as case 1 above. NSERC at this faculty's also historically been somewhat competitive ( last yr 35/70 accepted ). \n\nMy Q is : My goal is to eventually apply to med, but I know I might do a master's in biochem /  biomedical-sci related fields before. I wanna apply principles of scientific inquiry learn techniques and if given chance, conduct a small side project , so I'm really in it for the learning, I've always been.\n\n Based on my goal and on these researcher profiles, which one would you pick ? What is your reasoning ? ALSO : when I wanna apply for gradschool , will an NSERC USRA be looked upon much more favorably compared to other awards such as summer program funding awards ( which was quite competitive), to an extent that they disregard pretty much all else ?

Especially since a new mandatory criteria requires me to select a local NGO from the Sahel that could benefit from my research.\n\nSo I believe the next step is to find a specific EU climate-security nexus approach which can be linked to a (specific) climate-related issue in the Sahel? But I fail to do so, after reading so many documents and even made a table of different EU strategies, projects etc, but find it complex. Truth be told; the process becomes a bit overwhelming and I start to become really insecure about my ability to succeed.\n\nMy supervisor is unfortunately not helpful at all‚Ä¶in the last meeting he said that he did not read my research proposal and forgot about the subject. He said that I could start all over again or email an professors and see if they might help. I don‚Äôt want to give up‚Ä¶.\n\nMy research proposal is approved, but I encounter so many issues with narrowing down the scope of my research I would really appreciate some guidanceüòä. I want to graduate and do this. . I would be forever grateful.\n\nDown I elaborated a bit on the research:\n\nSub-questions:\n\n1. How did climate change develop as a security issue on the EU agenda?\n2. What are the main EU responses to tackle climate related security risks in the Sahel region?\n3. To what extent is the current EU climate-security nexus approach in the Sahel effective?\n4. What role could the EU play in future climate responses in the Sahel?\n\nFrom what I understood, the EU‚Äôs policies related to the climate security in the Sahel can be categorized as follows:\n\nA) Development policy, Climate policies , Security policies, Peacebuilding and conflict prevention, and diplomacy\n\nSo overall, the EU climate-security nexus acknowledges the complex relationship between climate change and security risks in the Sahel and addresses these risks through a comprehensive approach that includes development, conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance and military support.\n\nMoreover the EU-climate-security nexus considers climate-related issues in the Sahel as followed:\n\nB) Drought and desertification, water scarcity, land degradation, migration, conflict.\n\nI compiled a list of interesting EU projects and policies, which I can eventually send too.",

I asked if there was anything else, like if there were parts of the project that weren't quite right that I could get constructive feedback on and according to them, this was the only reason why we were docked points. \n\nI tried to explain again that the reason why I sometimes could not produce all 3 people's worth of work everytime I checked in with the profs was because I was actually one person trying to do 3 people's work.

        "text": "TL;DR What's the best way to tell someone I share my office with that he really needs to shower, and the smell is preventing me from working there while he's also there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy office-mate, a fellow grad student, has never been great about hygiene, but he often works from home or I have other places to work, so I've just tried to avoid saying anything about it. Usually, it's tolerable, and I just didn't want to have an awkward conversation. My advisor and the administrator for our department's grad program both talked to me in private a few weeks ago to ask if everything's okay with me sharing an office with him, as they noticed his hygiene was subpar and that they had a few other concerns about him (my advisor told me that neglecting grooming is a common sign of a student in crisis, but I don't think that's what's going on here).\n\nBut yesterday, man... I got one whiff of our shared office, and I was right out the door to find somewhere else on campus to do my work. When he was gone that evening, the office smelled a little musty but was tolerable, so it was definitely him and not something he's left in the office.\n\nIs it a good idea to try to have a conversation with him and say, \"If we're going to share this office, I need you to shower more frequently\"? I'm worried that, if the conversation goes badly, it'll just make my experience of the shared office worse and add awkward personal tension into the mix. Since the department admin has already checked in about him, would it be better to go to them and ask them to intervene rather than try to have this conversation myself? If anyone has some personal experience or insights about this, it'd be much appreciated.",

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this under, but I am absolutely freaking. \n\nTLDR: I got accepted into a graduate program and now I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the right choice for me/I should defer or just not go altogether \n\nI was super excited about and nervous about not getting into the graduate programs I applied to, but then I got into one I was extremely looking forward to. I applied to two schools and decided I changed my mind about the one when they offered me an interview because I knew that if I was already torn up about whether to go or not that I probably shouldn‚Äôt add other variables to the mix. But, my problem is that I‚Äôm kind of burnt out from school and don‚Äôt know if going for another 2 years is the right call. \n\nI got my associates by the time I got my high school degree and then I finished my bachelors in 3 instead of 4 years, so I‚Äôve really been doing school already the last 5 years and I‚Äôm kind of exhausted. I understand that this is a blessing of a problem to have and I don‚Äôt mean to sound ungrateful, I am just trying to be transparent. I also understand that this is a luxury for some people and I don‚Äôt mean to come off as if I am treating it like it isn‚Äôt.\n\nI am just unsure whether it‚Äôs the right choice for me and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the imposter syndrome talking, if I genuinely don‚Äôt want to go, if I‚Äôm being lazy and I‚Äôll love it once I‚Äôm there, or what. My option is to go from 2023-2025, or I can take the next year as a gap year and apply to programs like NALCAP, JET, and others for fall 2024 and just work in between. \n\nI‚Äôm really stuck and I‚Äôd just love some personal anecdotes, advice, or really anything.
