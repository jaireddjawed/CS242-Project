        "text": "This happened years ago in my childhood home, which my parents still live in. First I should give you the layout. As soon as you walk in the front door it‚Äôs the living room and then to the left is the kitchen, on the other side of the kitchen wall is the hallway bathroom wall. \n\nSo me and one of my older sisters were home alone. She was in the bathroom doing her hair and I was sitting on a small bench we had in the hallway texting on my phone and watching something on the living room tv. From where I was sitting I was facing the living room and the bathroom door is to my right but I couldn‚Äôt see in the kitchen. \n\nWe‚Äôre just talking when all of a sudden we both stop because we hear something in the kitchen and I jump up and run in the bathroom and we lock the door. We both had cell phones and we were trying to call our cousin and other sister that are supposed to be on their way to pick us up but both of our phones at the same time said no service! We were freaking out because we were just using them and they were working fine. \n\nAfter the phones said no services we heard a scratching on the wall that the kitchen and bathroom share. It sounded like something was dragging a stick from one end to the other. That‚Äôs when we started looking for weapons but there wasn‚Äôt shit in the bathroom lmao. We sat there for I don‚Äôt know how long just listening but we didn‚Äôt hear anything else when all of a sudden the living room tv starts playing full blast and then our phones finally had service. We didn‚Äôt leave the bathroom until my sister and cousin got there lol.",

        "text": "I grew up in a funeral home.\nOkay firstly I'd like to say if it's hard to believe anything I say on here, trust me I understand. I've never felt believed while talking about this.\nWhen I was 11 me and my family moved into a huge 6 bedroom 2 bath house. At the time my mom was a very spiritual person and very into the supernatural. My dad knowing this willfully kept the fact it was a funeral home from my mom knowing damm well she would have no part in living a house of death. Well about a year after living there a priest in a wheelchair knocked on our door and asked if they could speak to one of my parents. My mom being the only one home happily invited him in. Since it was so long ago I don't remember the whole conversation but basically he informed her that our house use to be a funeral home. To no surprise my mom was very concerned about this, so the priest in what I assume was a way to relivate her concerns offered to cleanse the house. The darkness and hatred that was felt in that house still messes with me today. That baptism woke something up and made it very angry. I don't know how to put this without sounding crazy but basically me and my friends found a tombstone in the basement. This tombstone had a pillar inside of it that was connected to the living room basically holding up the floor. The tombstone was upside down and broken at the top. It just had one word on it, in broad letters it spelled WOW. I thought nothing of this until I was 15 and my mom died in that house on the Living room floor. It occurred to me that the tombstone didn't say WOW. THE FUCKING THING SAID MOM. I want to burn that house down. I know it's all a coincidence but is it really.",

        "text": "Last night, I had a dream that I was at some fancy dinner like place with my mom's father, I called him Poppy. All I remember from the dream is sitting next to him at the fancy table and I believe we were \"exchanging\" drinks? Like, I had a Coca-Cola in a fancy wine glass and he had water but it seemed like we were passing it to one another. He frequently bartended after retirement and I always remember being so excited to ask for \"bar coke\" as a kid lol, so at first I chalked the dream up to that. \n\nBut then this morning my mom started to tell me that she had a weird dream last night, and I immediately spoke up and told her I had a dream about Poppy. She responded with, \"Well that's weird, I had a dream about Poppy, too.\" I told her about how we were at some fancy dinner venue place, and she said that her dream was exactly the same, except she was off doing something else at the dinner party rather than sitting with Poppy and I. Which is kinda funny, because I don't remembering seeing her in my dream at all. It's just crazy that her and I had pretty much the same dream about her dad.\n\nMy brother and I also had the same dream when we were kids, also with Poppy in it but before he passed away. It was about our grandparent's dog, Molly, and that Poppy had to take her to get put down. One day a few years ago my brother randomly told me about this dream, and that it was weird to him because he felt like Molly wasn't \"really there\" for the next 2 weeks before she *actually* had to be put down. and I was absolutely blown away that I had the same exact dream and feeling about Molly around the same time. \n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences before? This is all just so interesting to me.",

        "text": "UPDATED POST\nEDIT TO CLARIFY: Not a music ‚Äúbox‚Äù \n\nAn antique Angel figurine my grandma gave me when I was a baby (32 now) just started slowly playing its tune on the shelf. It‚Äôs was at my Grandmas house that she bought in 1979 for decades until sitting in my mom‚Äôs basement since she sold the house in 2016 (after grandpa passed, RIP). She and my mom gave it to me at Thanksgiving time. \n\nI forgot it was even a musical item until tonight when it went off! I set it on my ancestral altar when I got it and it‚Äôs just been sitting there ever since. I then remembered how it played music at my grandmas house when I was little. My grandma had so many music boxes and would wind them all up for me over and over. The figure is a little angel girl playing a ukulele. She just has a little hand painted (creepy) face. \n\nI got sooo freaked out last night when it started playing‚Ä¶very slowly‚Ä¶several notes. Then several more a few minutes later. I was frozen and ran to get my bf on the couch. I was telling him that the thing is playing music and I didn‚Äôt touch it! He was all half asleep and disoriented like, ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù But he could hear it playing from the bedroom! Made him come back to bed with me and I was like ‚ÄúIf that thing starts again I‚Äôm gonna lose my shit.‚Äù I was laying there in terror and trying to pray and sure enough‚Ä¶a few minutes later a few more notes spill out. I started going ‚ÄúNope! No!‚Äù I start praying to Jesus to protect me and of course a few minutes later, several more notes. I shook my bf up and made him take it out of the bedroom!\n\nIt stopped for the rest of the night once he removed it from the shelf. \nI asked my grandma about it today and she said she got it in a garage sale shortly after she moved into said house (1979). It came from an elderly neighbor who said it had been her daughter‚Äôs. I‚Äôd date it to at least 1959/61. \n\nBefore I told her the story, my grandma was like ‚ÄúYou and I wound that one up so many times, it just got stuck and stopped playing!‚Äù She was thrilled when I told her ab it, then said, ‚ÄúOh my gosh‚Ä¶ghosts!‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è She‚Äôs an 87 year-old definite descendant of witch‚Äôs, and a magical, young-at-heart woman. ü™Ñüíñ\nI‚Äôm still freaked out, but please share your thoughts! I will likely cleanse it with sage later.",

Great little van, but I have to keep it locked along with any doors or gates at the house whenever I'm going out or anything because my area is chock-a-block with filthy little thieves.\n\nAnyhow, I'm quite dopey and sometimes I forget things.. So tonight, while my mum and stepfather were sound asleep, me being me I went to go grab some munchie food from inside. I open the screen door only to realise the main door is locked, so I thought fuck it I'll just wait for breakfast. I start to walk back down the lawn and I hear a noise that took me a second to process; the main door just opened. I turn back and see a shadowy figure in the door, and think it's just mum because the lights were off in the house. I walk up, open the screen and start to walk in. Try to push the main door open a bit more but it was like something (or someONE) was behind it. I checked around the entire front area, then made a beeline for my parent's room where they were both still just laying there asleep. There is *absolutely nobody else* in the house and the wind we do get definitely isn't strong enough to open a locked door.\n\nWhat the fuck just opened my door for me? the dogs sat barking at me when I initially tried to open the door but then stopped right before it went ahead and opened itself too. They still sat at the door, they just started acting a little off after the door opened.",

When I came back my fianc√© told me about ‚Äúwierd‚Äù things happening. This alarmed me because he isn‚Äôt a skeptical person. He has an explanation for everything. He said these things happened:\n1. Living room was chilly, with house heater on and not super cold outside.\n2. He slightly closed our son‚Äôs door and came back to it open 6 inches\n3. Thinks he left master bed room closet light on and came back to it off \n4. Our pet rats apparently got out of their cage and crawled on him while he was on the living room couch. They‚Äôve never gotten out the entire year we‚Äôve owned them.\n5. Heard a loud tap on living room window.\n\nHe seemed to be pretty freaked out about it and acted like I was being disrespectful if I spoke about it. I wasn‚Äôt taking it too serious because I made up explanations for each thing. \nWell today I hear a loud sound behind me, in the other room (living room), so I walk to the living room and stand there trying to see if it was my son, playing with toys in his bedroom. I hear it again and jump back as the sound clearly is coming from an area by our couch in our living room. The sound was as if you put uncooked beans in a thick, hard plastic, cylinder and rolled it back and forth. It was loud and undeniable. I called my fianc√© into the living room and asked if he had put anything by his gaming setup (which is near the couch) that would make an odd noise. We looked for something that could‚Äôve made the noise and found nothing. It could‚Äôve been some metal items that he had sitting on the plastic base of his computer but the sound was still different than that. I told myself it may have been an animal in our wall but even that is not convincing me",

I was socially awkward ( I still am ) and I was completely abnormal. I remember giving myself numerous nonsense names like vop-2011!!! I was always Alice in the Wonderland, daydreaming 24/7. I was afraid of sleeping!!! Well not because of darkness or loneliness or the monster under the bed but the sleeping itself!! I wonder how my parents had no idea about it, maybe because I was a great role player! I could hear whispers and pale images when I was half conscious and they were complete nonsense like a triangle inside a circle lol. I was a fearless kid darkness wouldn't bother me at all in fact I kinda loved it but... suddenly out of no where I somehow started to develop a severe phobia of darkness to the point that I'd be paralyzed on the bed without sleeping , staring at the ceiling. Images entities whatever always appeared when I was half conscious. It was mostly a black cat, imagine the darkest color possible nearly like a void wandering around my room , I'd blink hundered times to make it disappear but it just wouldn't. Sleeping was torture ( still is ) , my nightmares were almost the reality , the presence of a monster in my dream would last for hours and sometimes even some signs of its presence would appear afterwards?! Like knocking on the door or things randomly falling just after I wake up from my nightmares. I once saw a deformed creature standing in front of me I was fully conscious . I was trembling nearly had a heart attack. I rushed to the kitchen to get a glass of water but it fell and shattered, I was out of breath hence I opened the window I suddenly forgot everything as if I was just dreaming but I was genuinely standing in front of the window wondering how I got there I remembered everything a few minutes after that , are all these just weird dreams or my mind is tricking me . I have ADHD BTW my weird childhood behavior might be because of that but recent experiences are just weird...",

Elevators were going up and down without an occupant, and there were inexplicable electrical problems as well.\n\nThe man on duty placed a mobile phone in one of the wards and pushed the record button. As he listened to the recording, he heard conversations, Bible verses being read aloud, screams, crying, and singing. The noise was overwhelming.\n\nI believe these apparitions are not spirits, but rather the residues of memories left behind by the dying. Their emotions, drained into the walls and furnishings of the hospital, linger long after they have gone.\n\nI think if emotions are very intense, they can be left behind in the physical world and they somehow interact with the environment and you can sense them.\n\nBut he also told me that some patients went crazy after spending some time at the hospital. I think they just could not process those emotions left behind by other patients.",

Never seen or heard anything unexplainable until out of nowhere weird noises could be heard outside our house.\n\nAbout 3 years ago now the first noises were heard by both me and my mom. We had let the dog out around 12 at night and we‚Äôre letting him back in and talking when we heard a sound that no animal could make. It sounded like a large cat that had its throat slit it was like a gargling meow. We both immediately stopped talking and looked outside to see if there was anything just outside because that‚Äôs where it sounded like it was coming from just beyond where our houses lights could reach but we saw nothing. It was like something just letting you know it‚Äôs there then not doing anything or making another sound.\n\nThe next incident happened a couple months after when I was sleeping outside my room since I didn‚Äôt have a bed at the time and the futon couldn‚Äôt fit through my doorway. It was late at night I was watching tv and I heard what sounded like someone moving stuff around just outside my laundry room. The layout of my basement is pretty open so from where I was laying I could see almost everything in the basement except the laundry room and another open area at the bottom of the stairs so I thought someone might‚Äôve come down to get something from the fridge or freezer so I just went back to watching tv. A couple seconds later I heard someone walking around bare foot and since the floor is concrete you can hear it pretty clearly so I sat up and thought someone was gonna turn the corner but then the walking turned into a full sprint and that‚Äôs when it happened I watched as the footsteps ran past in front of me but nobody was there. They disappeared into our unfinished bathroom and stopped instantly and when I say instantly I mean no slow down in the footsteps just an abrupt stop. My dog used to sleep in that bathroom but after that he wouldn‚Äôt even come downstairs.\n\nAfter that I had my first and last sleep paralysis episode where I heard the same footsteps before a pitch black person on all fours crawled at me and got right in my face before disappearing under the futon.\n\nThe final incident happened probably 3 or 4 months later when I was finally back in my room. I was laying in bed when I heard those footsteps again but it sounded like they were running around aimlessly. After a good minute of this they stopped in front of my door and it went quiet but only for a few seconds before my doorknob began to jiggle back and forth. I‚Äôve never had that sense of dread ever in my life and I‚Äôve never been so scared. I ran to my door grabbed the knob and sat with my back up against the door and my feet pushing against the wall opposite. I even looked under the door and there was nothing there. I probably sat there for 30 minutes before I got the courage to move and throughout those 30 minutes I kept looking under the door. I slept with a steel bar that night.\n\nSince that night nothing major has happened but sometimes when I come back into my room and close the door I‚Äôll turn around and my door will be open again.",

        "text": "Hey, I've been company to a lot of supernatural stuff most of my life. However, I've never had an experience as the one I had this past new year's morning. I honestly would like to know what the event could possibly mean. \n\nSorry, it's long.\n\nOk, so just a little background. My mom passed away almost 9 years ago and my dad almost 8 years ago. I am currently 37. I say this because with my parents passing away, as my friend's parents are beginning to do the same, I am usually the one that everybody knows truly understand how they feel.\n\nAbout 10 years before my mom passed, I kind of made her promise that whenever she finally went to her forever home, I don't want to see her, feel her, smell her or hear her. The only way to visit me is in my dreams. Though I didn't tell my dad the same because his passing was way more sudden (my mom had cancer for 20 years, my dad 2 months), he visits me the same. ONLY thru dreams.\n\nOk, so New Year's morning 2023. Now, my godsister's mom passed over a year ago. My godsis is surviving but her and her mom were like me and mine, close. So since we both were at home, she invited me over. We kicked it. Chill night. One thing I did notice though was while I was in the living room by myself, my god-niece's lil dog was walking toward the couch then kind of stopped and retreated back. He looked scared to me, but throughout the night, he seemed to just be jumpy. At that time I felt like I wasn't alone. But it wasn't a bad feeling just like a feeling. \n\nAnyway, In her house, she has a shelf on her wall that is dedicated to her mom's memories. It's surrounded by family pictures as well. On the top shelf, she has a candle. Now she's told me that the candle will sometimes flicker on and she feels its her mom due to the timing. The light is not always on and comes off and on sporadically. \n\nAt midnight New Year's Day, my godsis notice it flickered. After we said Happy New Year, it flickered some more than stopped. We continued watching TV and went on with our night.\n\nOk, so after all of the above, here's the base of this event.\n\nSo around 1:30 maybe 2, we both started to fall asleep. She has a L shaped sectional. I was on the chaise like end, with my upper body belly down towards the kitchen, while laying on my left arm. I was facing away from the family wall. My godsis  has an open floor planned house. Her mom's memorial/the family wall is on the same wall as the kitchen. My sis was on the couch-part, closer to the side near my feet, asleep. \n\nI was in that state of sleep when your eyes are heavy, but you're still pretty aware of your surroundings, just hella relaxed. Anyway, as I was laying there slowly falling deeper into sleep, I felt as if I could see the entire room, but it wasn't like it was me. I said something. I don't remember. I honestly don't think I said it from my lips, more like my thoughts had a voice, while my mouth stayed shut. \n\nNext thing I know, I felt as if my upper body was pulled forcefully, yet non aggressively towards the family wall. I remember thinking, bruh does my sis see me moving? Then as soon as I stopped moving, I woke up right in the place and position I was in as I was dosing off. I hadn't moved at all. I sat up, looked at my sis, who was still sleep, and then repositioned myself so that my arms were under me, beneath the covers, and went back to sleep, sans another incident. \n\nMy question is what was that? I didn't feel anything negative. It was chill, just the fact that It happened, kind of trips me out. Has this ever happened to anyone before?\n\nAgain, sorry so long.",

        "text": "So a friends child recently confided in me that he hasn‚Äôt been able to sleep for the last two nights. He says it‚Äôs because there is SOMETHING, not someone, in his room. It disappears when he shines his phone light at it and if someone opens the door it runs to his sisters room. It sits on the edge of his bed and it actually touches him. He can actually feel it touching his leg. I am in the mental health field(skills coach) and I have already gone through the official process of elimination for sexual abuse(no bruises/marks, no regressive behaviors, no areas sore that shouldn‚Äôt be, etc. etc. ect.) so we have established it‚Äôs likely not that. It‚Äôs not sleep paralysis because it often comes when he is playing on his phone before going to sleep. He has described the ‚Äúcreature‚Äù as a tall, dark(shadowy) human-like figure that has bright white eyes. He has heard it whisper but cannot make out what it says only that it is a male-like voice. I had assumed it could be a‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúflesh-roamer‚Äù because I don‚Äôt need one finding meüòÇüòÇ however with it disappearing when he shines a light, I‚Äôm not positive that it could be a skin______‚Ä¶..flesh roamer‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a raven mocker either because he isn‚Äôt sick or actively dying. I think it could be some sort of shadow person, but there are so many phenomena that display similar traits that I cannot narrow it down. I have ruled out schizophrenia, as he doesn‚Äôt display any other symptoms, and he also isn‚Äôt at the age where the symptoms should show anyways. What is this thing? How can he protect himself? Can we make it go away? Or if not,  Can we kill it? And how? He hasn‚Äôt told anyone else because he is afraid of being laughed at for ‚Äúbeing 13 and afraid of the dark‚Äù or yelled at for lying to get attention, neither of which I believe are true. Call me crazy but I think something is actually there‚Ä¶.. how do I help him?",

        "text": "So this happened 12 hours ago. It started with me having this weird dream where I saw upside down leaves and birds and the voice narrating in my head was saying those were symbols for death. There were more symbols but I cannot remember them. I woke up early at 2am. This usually happens to me but I typically see shadow figures or a clown in some of the paintings in my room. I always brush those off as sleep paralysis because I‚Äôve read that shadows are typically sleep paralysis. This time was different. When I awoke I saw a man on top of me. He was grabbing me trying to shake me awake. It was clear that it was a man and he wasn‚Äôt from our time. He was short with dark skin. He had long wavy hair and looked very distressed. I knew I was awake because my room looked like my room, same paintings, my blanket was halfway over me, and I was laying down on my back. The man kept shaking me and I could see that he was wearing a skirt of some sort. He was definitely Native American but he did not look like he was from 2023. When my eyes were fully opened, he stared into my eyes. He kept yelling at me to help him. That is all he said. But his mouth was not moving and it seemed like he was talking to me from inside my head. I looked to my right and saw the most scary thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. It was a bird skull humanoid thing with a huge beak. It almost looked like a toucan beak. It was wearing a black robe and the skull was white. It had a stick in its hand that also had a bird skull connected to it. It was standing 3-4 ft away from me, just starting at me or the man. I couldn‚Äôt tell because it didn‚Äôt have eyes, only a skull. I tried not to stare at it for too long and the man on top of kept shaking me. When I finally looked back at the man, I tried to speak but I couldn‚Äôt because I was paralyzed in fear. He kept shaking me for what felt like 5 minutes pleading for me to help him. When I finally asked how I could help him, he disappeared with the bird skull thing. It was weird because I said it with my mind instead of saying it out loud. I was able to move and talk right when they left. I grabbed my phone immediately and the time was 2:15 am. I called my brother immediately and told him what happened. I wasn‚Äôt scared in the moment when it was happening. I didn‚Äôt scream or anything like that. But I could not go back to sleep, the only thing in my mind was that scary bird thing. I stayed up all night trying to research what it was. I‚Äôm not into Native American history or their mythology. I‚Äôve never researched something like that but I was intrigued after what had happened. The man definitely didn‚Äôt seem from our time and I don‚Äôt think he realized that he was dead. I‚Äôm not sure why the crow thing was there or why it chose to bother me that night. I wish I had sleep paralysis over that because at least I could say it was in my head. This felt too real to be a figment of my imagination. Well while I was researching I found a picture of what I saw. I think the man was from the anasazi tribe. The tribe had a weird disappearance that hasn‚Äôt been explained in history. When I looked up pictures of what they looked like, they were short with dark long hair. They wore skirts and no shirts. And the crow demon thing was from their religion. There is a movie that I‚Äôve never even heard of called the darkness. It features 5 demons from their tribe and one of them is a crow demon. I‚Äôve never watched the movie. It was exactly what I saw starring at me. There isn‚Äôt much information on their tribe or beliefs because they are extinct. I‚Äôve been trying to find more information out about that crow demon because the man was so petrified of it. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for the rest of the night and all I‚Äôve been thinking about when I close my eyes is the crow demon. I‚Äôm not sure if it was good or bad because it didn‚Äôt try and hurt me. But maybe it‚Äôs because I am pregnant. I‚Äôm scared to sleep tonight and just to even close my eyes. I was alone last night when it happened. I wish I could brush it off as sleep paralysis but I don‚Äôt understand why I would see a Native American or a crow demon. It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve never seen or could have even imagined. It felt too real and once it disappeared I could feel it‚Äôs energy disappear. Once it was gone I was able to move but my eyes were already open. It made me feel crazy and my partner has been trying to tell me both were demons. I‚Äôm not a person who believes in heaven or hell, let alone demons. I‚Äôve been trying to tell myself it was sleep paralysis but it felt so different. Sorry for my rant and if I sound crazy. I‚Äôm running off of no sleep and scared to sleep again.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/104abdw/the_ghost_of_night_shift/",
        "text": "My first job out of college was working as a quality control lab technician at a factory. We made over the counter personal care items. The factory was essentially 24/7 except Saturdays had limited production and Sundays had no production. I worked the graveyard shift for a while before I moved to the mornings. When I first joined the night shift my coworkers would always make jokes or comments about the ‚Äúghost of night shift‚Äù. Often they would just blame things going awry on the ghost but they also told me stories about things falling or being moved. Some of the things were larger heavy objects (like a stool) that would move in front of people without anything touching-that they could see. I would laugh at the stories cause honestly the place was a shit show to begin with and a ghost was probably the least of our problems. I believe in ghosts to an extent, but never really experienced anything before. Until one night, I heard a crash and turned around to see a USP (US Pharmacopeia) book on the floor, at least 7 feet from where we stored them on top of a filing cabinet. Those books are heavy, they are similar to dictionaries or encyclopedias, and they lay flat on top of the cabinet so they can‚Äôt just fall off. It looked as though it was pushed or thrown and I was the only one in there at the time. That was my first experience. I noticed other little things being moved around that seemed odd but nothing major that I couldn‚Äôt justify as something else. As time went on though and I moved to the morning shift and took over a different part of the lab. The mornings were so much hustle and bustle that a ghost could probably slap someone in the face and no one would have cared or even noticed. But we would also have to work Saturday days and those days were really quiet so everything was noticed. To understand, I have to describe the layout. The lab was on the second floor. When you enter the door to the main lab directly to the right was another door to a separate lab, which is where I ended up working when on the morning shift. And next to the door was a window into my mini lab. To the left was a storage closet and next to that was another small room with our expensive equipment and machines. Once you walk down the short hallway you would enter the large main lab. When working in the main lab, you cannot see the main door unless you peaked your head around the corner down the short hallway. Right outside the main door is another door that leads to a stairwell. You have to badge into the stairwell door and when it unlocks it makes a loud click. This is important. Well, I was working a Saturday morning. I was alone as we would alternate weekends and only one person would come in. I was in the main lab and I heard the loud click of the stairwell door. I then heard the main lab door open. Only one manger would ever come in on the weekends and it was a very rare occurrence. Other than that no one else worked on Saturday, not even the cleaning staff. And the floor workers did not have the badge access to go through that door. I called ‚ÄúHey Matt, is that you?‚Äù. I heard Matt‚Äôs voice talking back. You can hear people audibly speaking but due to the loud hum of some of the machines its hard to distinguish words. His tone sounded totally normal just as if he was saying ‚ÄúHey yeah just came to get a few things.‚Äù Or something like that but I couldn‚Äôt be sure so I called back. ‚ÄúSorry I didn‚Äôt hear you, what was that?‚Äù He started to say something else. Realizing I wasn‚Äôt going to understand him, I walked around to the hallway. When I rounded the corner...nothing. No Matt. No person at all. And the voice I was hearing promptly stopped just as I looked down the hall. The lab door was closed and not only that the motion sensor light was off outside of the lab so no one ever came upstairs. I went outside the lab to check for myself. The motion light came on immediately when I exited so I knew it was working properly and called out for anyone. I walked around the floor. All the lights were off, the bathrooms were empty and the doors were locked. And I never heard the loud click of someone going back out of the stairwell door either. The second story wasn‚Äôt large so there weren‚Äôt many places for someone to go and not be seen. I didn‚Äôt really tell anyone about the incident. I just tried to shrug it off and finish my work and when I went in on Monday, I asked Matt if he came in that Saturday. He said he did not. At least a year went by, Matt no longer worked at the company and we had a high turnover rate so a lot of the lab workers were new. I came in on a Monday morning, sat at my computer and the guy that worked that weekend came into my area. He asked if I came in on Saturday. I said ‚Äúno‚Äù. He asked if I was sure. I said I was sure. Remembering my past experience I asked why. He said that while he was working on Saturday he heard the stairwell door open then he heard the main lab door. When no one came into the main lab he assumed it was me and I went into my little lab. He called to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù and to ask why I was there. He said he heard my voice respond, but just like last time, could not make out exactly what the voice was saying. When he came around the corner to greet [what he thought was] me...nothing. My door was closed and the light was off. The motion light outside the lab was off and he never heard anyone leave. I told him the same thing happened to me and told him my story. We just kind of laughed nervously and made comments like ‚Äúwell I guess the night shift ghost also comes out on the weekends too.‚Äù\n\nThe factory had been there for decades and a man did die there back in the 70s or 80s from getting stuck in a tank and suffocating. All I can say is that if my spirit was stuck in that hell hole of a factory forever, I‚Äôd probably throw heavy shit too.",

        "text": "Yesterday, my grandma who I am very close to passed away. She had had multiple major strokes in a single night and was suffering a major brain bleed. Doctors said 75% of her brain was damaged, and she would not wake up again. We made the decision to end life support as we knew she wouldn't want to be kept alive as a vegetable past her time.\n\nI had always heard stories of peoples dying loved ones sitting up before passing, or saying the names of those that had died before, or even just opening their eyes or throwing their arms up. Since my grandmas brain activity was so limited, I knew that there would be no such signs, no matter how much I knew they'd comfort me.\n\nThe ICU door for the grandmas room was very heavy and hard to unlatch, and had stayed closed all day and yesterday to give us some privacy with her. I struggled every time I had to open it as you had to really push down to unlatch it. \n\nWe were all sitting in her room waiting for the final shoe to drop when the door unlatched and opened. It opened up a good ways pretty quickly, not as if it had been shoved but more like someone was just opening it. We waited for a nurse to come inside, but nobody was there. I got up and closed the door, making sure to push it hard into place.\n\nAbout five minutes later, we heard the hard sound of the door unlatching, and it swung open again with controlled quickness, stopping just short of slamming into a table. This time we left it open. The doctors were expecting her to survive at least a few days after ending life support, but she died not an hour later after the door opened. \n\nAt the end she was not in pain, and she passed as if falling asleep. My mom and I are happy knowing she had people there to walk her home.",

Street when she leaves is just the road (if u can call it road) with private houses along it, and there was a house, where in front of it was two perfectly symmetrical trees. \n  This trees was about 10 meters high, and was looking like a tree poles that was uprooted from the earth, there was no leaves and even branches on it, top of this trees was like the bottom of average uprooted tree, roots was ON top of it. They both was almost black, i believe they was like dried up, maybe it was pine trees, that was cutted, but how they manage to dry so much? If that way, it was cutted decades ago. Also, why is there was such enormous trees? It was not an half abandoned wild village in the middle of nowhere, it was just small settlement in a couple kilometers from a normal town.\n  At some point, when i visited my granma again, there not just was no trees, but not even a land without grass on spots where they was or something. Of course, no one knows nothing what trees i was talking about. I remember there was a photo of little me with this trees in the background, exact same trees, not as pine trees, but that identical black death pillars. But guess what, I can't find it. There was a bunch of b/w photos of my grandmother's fathers and other relatives with that trees in the background, not as pine trees, but that identical black death fucking pillars, but guess what.\n  I know they was there.",

        "text": "I am currently doing through a divorce and about 2 months ago I voluntarily left my home to my soon to be ex wife and our 3 kids until we can come to an agreement on a living situation. She does not have family in our state and I do. \n\nWe had many things happen over there. Shadows dashing in the hall, phantom voices coming from rooms no one was in and even the shadow of what looked like a little girl jumping out of our bed in the middle of the night. These occurred on a weekly basis. I even had 3 paranormal investigators go to my home and we all saw the little ‚Äúgirl‚Äù dart behind the island in the kitchen.\n\nHere at my mom‚Äôs I stay in my childhood bedroom that‚Äôs adjacent to a bathroom with a barn door. The barn door does not roll. A few times at night from the corner of my eye I could see something mailing back and forth in the bathroom. It got to the point where I just set up a curtain so I did not have to see in there.\n\nMy sister, who also lives with my mother, has two small dogs. At times they both would tense up and stare at absolutely nothing and begin to bark. One night we were watching tv in the living room and they both jumped off the couch and seemed to be following someone who was not there. They go into a bedroom, we hear a small bang and they start barking and ran back to the couch. My mom wrote it off as them following a fly and I think different.\n\nLast night I went to bed around ten. I‚Äôm a light sleeper so I heard commotion around 3:30 in my bathroom and woke up. I figured it was the dogs playing in the bathroom as they have free reign of the house. When they are making noise we just call out their names and they run out of the room. I did this 3 times and they never came out. On the fourth call out my sister who sleeps down the hall yells out ‚Äúthey‚Äôre here on my bed‚Äù. I feel my body turn white and I just stared at the curtain. There‚Äôs still commotion in the bathroom but I clearly hear someone pacing barefoot on the tile floor. Out of nowhere it stops and I just wait for someone to come out until 7:00am where the sun starts to brighten the room and I fall back asleep.",

        "text": "Quick back story, I‚Äôve been able to see spirits since I was a kid. Being visited in my dreams and seeing energy shapes amongst the physical people is part of my normal life and always has been. I‚Äôve had several personal encounters with malevolent spirits as well but things have been relatively dormant in that area for the last few years, until last night.\n\nI‚Äôve had sleep paralysis probably a total of 5 times in my life, each time I see the same apparition. A shadow figure with an extremely detailed silhouette, usually 7 or 8 feet tall, maybe more and always a male energy. More than once Ive seen it come out of the ground and grow to those heights. Other times I‚Äôve seen it just looming over my bed.\n\nNow I‚Äôve just moved from Florida up to New York, naturally the building I‚Äôm living is is pretty old. Last night I woke up at about 2:45am and had to go for a late night pee. In the bathroom I was half asleep and closed my eyes for a moment and very clearly felt someone walk into the bathroom and stand in the doorway. I think it‚Äôs maybe my girlfriend so I immediately snap my eyes open to find no one there. I clean up and head back to bed where she‚Äôs sound asleep and crawl back in. I fall asleep pretty quickly and immediately start dreaming about the room I‚Äôm in.\n\nI‚Äôm laying down in my dream, and the window in my physical room was actually a door in my dream. The door started rattling and flew open and guess who is standing in the doorway looking down at me? The shadow person. I immediately freeze in the dream and the paralysis sets in. This time was the first time the shadow was a woman though. She had shoulder length hair but was still the same 8 feet+ tall. She reaches down and puts her hand on my shoulder and then sticks her giant nails right through my flesh and I‚Äôm trying so hard to scream but can‚Äôt.\n\nAt this point I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm dreaming and paralyzed so I‚Äôm only focused on trying to make a noise to get my girlfriend to wake me up. I felt like I was strapped to the bed but managed to get a couple whines out and she miraculously heard me and shook me awake.\n\nI immediately opened my eyes and was able to move my limbs again but I could still feel the nails in my shoulder as if the woman was still holding me. Eventually the pain faded after several minutes of me rubbing it, but it definitely shook me up today. Just thought I‚Äôd share",

I was folding laundry and then walked into the hallway where our linen closet was to put towels away. I'm standing there putting the towels on the shelf when I hear \"momma!\" clear as day in my ear... followed by a yell \"MOMMA!!!!!\", I turn around and say \"WHAT Jonah??\" because it sounded exactly like my son's voice and i was so sure it was him right behind me. Once I turn around, nobody is there. I'm confused. I go look in my boys room and everybody is sound asleep. I have no explanation for this and still tell people about it til this day because it really freaked me out. \n\nJust wanted to share!",

Certain parts of the dream are a bit more vague now, but the feelings, colors and beauty of it are still in my mind. I have no idea what it meant, or if it meant anything at all. If anyone has any information??\n\nI was entering this large, dark cavern but certain parts of the wall had these ethereal glowing spots in them. I was in front of this open space in a hazy dark when all of a sudden slightly glowing, colorful lines began falling from nowhere. It was like when you see those paint videos where an artist uses a funnel and just pours different paint colors into it before lifting it and letting the colors all fall. That's as realistic of a description i could give. It was like that but much more dreamy.. it continued until it formed a HUGE portrait of a woman her head to about the armpit. It wasn't a life sized person, it was as if she was the size of the space I was in. But I never felt fear, she lit the cavern with her colors and the walls were stone and crystalized, not that they had huge shoots growing out of the walls but it was growing like ivy. Everything was so beautiful. She had said something to me, but I can't remember. I want to remember so badly, I want to see her again so badly. The experience was amazing. There were no drugs involved in this. I have 4 good experiences with dreams feeling similarly beautiful and realistic and I can never will them back. I have a lot of nightmares and recurring dreams I don't want however.",

        "text": "Hi! This is my first time posting something on here, but I wanted answers to an experience I had when I was 8. I'm in my mid twenties now. In my childhood room, I had a large full drumset. I played it frequently and it took up a lot of space in my bedroom. One time, I woke up in the middle of the night, and my drumset was gone. My room was usually pitch black at night, but it was now dimly lit. In place of my drumset was a very pale girl sitting in a wooden chair. She looked to be in her early twenties, had shoulder-length hair, and wore a white shirt and blue jeans. I never saw the front of her face but got a pretty good view of the side. She sat hunched over in the chair.\n\nNext, I noticed my bedroom door was open. I NEVER left my bedroom door open. In the doorway was a dark figure. In their right hand, they were holding some kind of knife. I could see the shadow of it against my wall. The other appendage was some kind of tentacle. I couldn't move or speak the entire time I experienced this. I don't remember if I fell asleep or they left. But eventually, they were gone, and my drumset had returned.\n\nThe next morning, I told my mom, and she believed I saw demons. I don't believe in any God or deity, but she is a huge Christian. So she took olive oil and painted crosses on each door and window in the house. Nothing happened again for several years.\n\nThen, one night, when I was in high school, I was on Skype with the girl I was dating. Suddenly, my door opened a small crack. I was expecting it to be my mom about to ground me for being on my phone this late. But I didn't see anything at all, and nothing happened. I then got up, went to the door, and looked around. Nothing. I shut it and got back in bed. Nothing weird ever happened in that house again.\n\nDoes anyone know what I saw when I was 8? Ghosts, demons, etc? I've always wondered about this, and I'm curious if anyone knows. I'm also curious if the door opening itself was related to that incident.",

As for work. There seems to be multiple entities. In one of the freezers it has been said by multiple people they are seeing a small child in the area. In the area i work there are multiple Shadow entities in the most secluded areas of the wearhouse. Multiple people have seen this. These are people who i have never spoken too nor had interactions with. They all report the same strange sightings of Figures watching them from distances. This has weirdly began getting worse along with the hotspot area beginning to crack on the wall. I have spent time alone in that area trying to get anything i can on film or photographed. Nothing. But i have been seeing the Shadow entity more in that area when i do my tasks. Not sure what can be done to either get rid of or please the entity. I have also had an encounter with the Woman in white on the side of the road. Driving late at night in rural arkansas. She seemed to disappear after i passed her. This is the same highway when i was stopped at 3am on a bridge due to construction work i was hearing lots of noises in the woods. I was the only person on the highway at the time. I started to hear someone talk almost an unrecognizable sounding language. I got the hell out of there. Last time i drive alone at nights with my windows down. Anyway i‚Äôll continue to update as the days go. Something is telling me it‚Äôs only getting worse.",

Tonight I'm so, so tired though and he's being quite full on so I tipped out his toy box and sat on the sofa. I started trying to tempt him saying hey where's this toy? Where's this one? \n\nThen I said where's your ball? And just a second later his tennis ball came rolling out of his toy box. Which he took and is now playing with. Neither of us were near the box at the time or even moving so I can't see how it happened. There was a good few minutes between me tipping the box and the ball rolling out.",

        "text": "Although I have experienced many strange things that most people would consider paranormal, I've always come up with some sort of explanation. I cant come up with any explanation for this though. \n\nI lived at my grandparents house until I was around 6 or 7. I shared a room with my sister and my moms room was at the end of the hallway right next to ours. \n\nI remember when I was young I would see a little girl standing in my bedroom doorway every night. She looked around 8 and had dark hair and a night dress on. She never did anything exept stand there and stare at me so I was never really bothered. As I've gotten older I have chalked it up to some sort of false memory or imaginary friend. I havent thought about it much since. \n\nA few years ago I mentioned it to my mom and she went pale. She said that she used to hear my sister but mostly me call her name during the night but every time she got up to see what we wanted, we were both sound asleep. Apparently one night she woke up and saw the little girl in her doorway, then blinked and she was gone. Then my mom told me that my grandpa had also seen the same girl walking down the hallway towards our rooms. \n\nI didnt know what to make of this at the time so I kind of brushed it off. \n\nHere is where it gets strange and I cant come up with any explanation.\n\nI moved back in with my grandparents last september(I'm 17 now). The first night there I was sleeping in my old room. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw a woman standing a few feet away from the side of my bed. She was tall, had shoulder length blonde hair and a flowy off white or grey dress on. I sat up and she walked out of the room. I just thought it was a weird really realistic dream. Strange, but that happens sometimes. \n\nI spent the night at a friends house yesterday and in the morning  my grandpa called me and told me he had to tell me something. He was being really weird and told me that he didnt know why but felt like he had to tell me this. \n\nHe said It was just starting to get light out and he woke up. He saw a lady standing at the end of his bed. She just stood there for a few seconds. It was too dark for him to see her face but he could tell she had on a lighter colored dress. He turned over to see if my grandma saw it, but she was still asleep. When he turned back the lady was walking out of their room. My dog was laying in the hallway and started barking and growling like crazy. He said that he then heard heavy foot steps going down the stairs while my dog stood at the top barking. \n\nMy grandpa has never mentioned anything like this to me so it was really weird. They have lived there over 20 years and he has never seen anything like that. These two experiences along with I guess what would be considered poltergeist activity, just seem to be too strange. \n\nI'm really starting to question things. I need help figuring this out. Before I never believed people when they said they saw full body apparitions but I'm starting to think it might be real.",

I remembered once seeing some kind of \"ghost\" which scared me behind the door but I was maybe 3 so this is not really important. \n\nI am now 24 and I don't live here anymore. I am a really good sleeper in the flats I had but each time I come back to my parents house I have horrible nights even when i'm home alone. I wake up multiple times in the middle of the nights for no reason and for the worst part I always have kind of the same nightmare where I am in my bed and there are kind of spirits annoying me/trying to rape me/strangle me (depends of the time) and it's impossible for me to wake up of this nightmare ! Or i think i woke up but i'm still in this nightmare always in my bed and it feels like it Nevers ends.\n\nTo avoid these nightmares i now leave a little Light in my bedroom and they are more rare but I still sleep very badly.\nI sleep very well at all over the places I go and I don't have these type of nightmares....\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it only me or is it the house?\n\nThanks :)",

Her father had lost a leg working in a coal mine in West Virginia, and he died when he was 53 of black lung.\n\nShe married my grandfather, who wasn‚Äôt the kindest or faithful, and we believe his treatment of her led her into the downward spiral of Alzheimer‚Äôs.

For an example when there was one tissue left in the tissue box he would call me or my mom to bring him another one. One day he called my mom in to the room.I was of course eavesdropping. He said that grandma moved the trash can and that she was here in the room watching over him. This freaked me out and I rushed downstairs to my room. At night I would hear weird sounds coming from my grandparents room. After my grandpa had passed away, me and my auntie were walking together, and she said that my grandpa told her that grandma was opening the closet every night and that he couldn't sleep. If  you look back at it, it all makes sense. He didn't want to be alone, the sounds and the moving trash can?

        "text": "I take this rather lightheartedly but it does creep me out at the same time. I‚Äôm visiting my dad in France with my mom and the whole dream took place in the same place where I‚Äôm in in real life. It felt a bit like a dream but sleep paralysis at the same time. It was a longe dream but to cut it short other paranormal activities were happening around the apartment and my mom didn‚Äôt believe me in the dream until a spirit of a girl physically manifested itself in the hallway and I turned on the flashlight of my phone to try and take a closer look but my flashlight kept blinking and as I was trying to get my mom to convince her it‚Äôs real she woke me up in real life. Apparently it looked like I was having a panic attack in my sleep so she woke me up and I was glad she did, I started to get really scared. I heavily remember how she looks like and even drew a picture of her (she looked more mature she seemed around 165cm and maybe 17/18. I would share the picture but this sun doesn‚Äôt allow pictures but she had black styled long hair and bangs. And wore a dark blue and black dress down to her knees. Overall she looked pretty polite!h\n\nMy day went on just taking it as another nightmare. I was outside for most of the time until it was night. I know it sounds very clich√©.\n\nI was hanging out with a friend on call and I walked around the apartment a lot. Mind you the hall way she was in started with the kitchen and ended with the living room with the bathroom in the middle. I remember wanting to talk with my dad but I was in the kitchen and I heard noises coming from the bathroom so I thought he‚Äôs probably using it at the moment so I continued walking to the living room and he was laying there and my mom as well. I thought that‚Äôs weird but it was probably just my mistake and I imagined things until it happened a second time.\n\nI really had to use the bathroom but I for sure saw the lights were on from under the door and it clearly being used by someone since I also heard noises inside as if someone is taking a shower or Bath and I was so annoyed because I really had to use the bathroom urgently until I again continued walking to the living room to see my dad and my mom. I checked the bathroom and no one was there. At least I was able to use the bathroom earlier now.\n\nSometimes I feel like someone‚Äôs walking behind me when I‚Äôm walking down the hallway in the dark and I feel like I catch something in the corner of my eye.\n\nIt probably means nothing and I might get hate for it but I tried out the tiktok trend where you would take a picture of your room and put it though the AI art filter to see if the filter will make up a person. In the room even if no one‚Äôs there so I have done the same thinking the AI won‚Äôt catch anything since there wasn‚Äôt really anything for the AI to mistake as a human but it actually generated a girl at the end of the hallway.\n\nNow like I said I take these things rather light heartedly but like to believe in them either way. as someone who has sleep paralysis every other night I just learned to befriend the monsters instead so I like to see it as a nice thing to have a other girl my age in the same apartment!\n\nEither way this is all probably just a weird coincidence but hey you could never know, right? Maybe it‚Äôs a spirit that died in my dads bathroom a long long time ago",

        "text": "Kia ora (be well)!\n\nI'm a professional Chaplain for the Order of St John of Rhodes, Malta, and Jerusalem. I specialize in blessings, cleansings, and spiritual conflict. If you're ever looking for advice, feel free to PM me - I'd be more than happy to help if I can but otherwise thought I'd add to the experiences of this sub. \n\nI've had some awesome paranormal experiences, and was around this sub a little while ago. I'm becoming active again, so thought I'd share a recent experience which freaked out my partner. \n\nAfter I started to get more involved in spiritual guidance, conflict, and intervention we started noticing more stuff happening around the house. One thing that came to visit was a large, dark figure. They were about 8ft tall (I'm 6'4, so tall in my own regard but this thing was huge). It was coming from an underground storage next to our room (we were staying in a basement). \n\nAfter getting involved in a particularly nasty case things started with knocking on the door from the underground storage area. Once a day, at random times, we would hear a simple \"knock knock knock\". The area was a brick walled room with dirt floor, but there was no external access by either wind or people. We largely ignored it, and when the knock happened - if I was there - I would rebuke whatever was knocking by letting it know it wasn't welcome.\n\nMy partner, however, opendc the door after the knocking but didn't tell me (she's not as spiritual as I am, and she was curious to figure out what the knocking was). The next day we were relaxing in bed when the guitar standing next to the door strummed twice incredibly loudly. Again, I rebuked, but again I didn't know she'd answered the door. \n\nThat night I was struggling to fall asleep. I was tossing and turning, and was frustrated so opened my eyes to go on my phone. When I did, roughly 20ft away, I saw a huge, black, shadow figure standing in the corner looking at us. It was well built, with broad shoulders and strong looking body. I was frozen with shock at first, and then flashed my phones screen in its direction. It didn't disappear immediately, but slowly dissapated from the bottom upwards. I prayed an incantation and went back to sleep. \n\nThe next night was the same. I struggled to sleep, and had a feeling why. When I was almost asleep I opened my eyes and, again, there the figure was. Except this time it was standing next to the door to the underground area. I grabbed my blessed taiaha (Maori weapon) and stood, then started to perform a fairly serious prayer. This half woke my partner up (this matters soon). As I prayed into the darkness, the same thing happened. The figure slowly disappeared. \n\nThe next day my partner asked what I was doing, and I told her. I then asked her if she'd seen anything, and she said she'd been hearing the knocking and tried to find the source. I asked her if she'd opened the door after knocking, and she said yes. \n\nSo I finally did what I should've, but was probably too scared to at the time in case I picked a fight I couldn't win (I was new to all of this), and blessed both our room and the storage room. I used frankincense and myrrh incense, holy water, and prayers in english, latin, and my native Maori language. I placed an iron cross above the door on the inside of the house, and placed bigger wooden crosses above all of the entry points to my room (including that one). \n\nI've had no problems since, and have gained a heck of a lot more confidence due to a lot more exposure. To this day I'm not 100% sure what I was dealing with, so would love to hear if anyone else has had experiences like this.",

        "text": "Great capture. You were right to take a picture when you felt that \"funny\" feeling. It was correct. Makes you question all the times that you felt that feeling and makes you wonder if they were an indication that there was something there unseen by your eyes.\nIn late September 1996, I stayed with a friend, her baby girl and my baby boy. They were born 1 day apart in June. She and I had been friends for 8 years. We had many mutual friends. I had been to her house many times since high school,  which had been her late parents house and her childhood home. Her mom had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia young, in her early 40's when we were in highschool. Her dad kept her home until he could bo longer care for her by herself.  He was a sweet man. She had 2 older brothers. The oldest moved out to go to college then. Her other brother was rarely home. When her died and her mom passed away,  shortly after she got married, the house went to get her and her new husband. They updated it and moved in and had their daughter. Her husband worked for a coal mine and it was pretty far away and too far to commute back and forth home every early morning. He worked long hours. He was in the newest hire in entry level management. So he got the shifts that the senior employees had left to move to the more desirable shifts or they got promoted. He stayed there in the companies designated hotel when it was his schedule to work and they rotated with the other employees that were in his job tier. So he got one 3 day weekend off a month. Then back to work. So it was just her daughter and her most of the time.  She invited me and my son to stay over one night. I happily accepted. I was a single mom. My son's father passed away before he was born and he never saw him. I lived with my mom and her husband. I was looking forward to a change of scenery and thought it would be good for mom to have some time with him alone.  \nWe had a great time. Both babies were so cute and were both good natured. She took kinds of pictures of us all.  We chatted and played with them, fed them, bathed them and put them to bed. We visited some more and when she said she was tired and was going to bed. I wanted to wind down for a little bit so I stayed up a bit longer. After she went to her room and I checked on my son, I went to the living room and sat on the couch. I sat there alone in the quiet,  I had this funny creepy feeling that I was being watched and got goose bumps. I told myself that I was being silly and that I was tired from lack of  a regular sleep pattern. I shrugged it off and got up and got ready for bed. We all slept through the night. The next morning we hung out. I stayed until about 4 pm. It was nice. Before I left she said she would take the pictures to be developed and would get 2 copies made and would let me know when she got them back. 2 weeks later she called and said she had them if I wanted to come by and get them. She then said that she and her husband were there.  Then she that she wanted to show me something in a few of the pictures and would not alaborate further just that she and her husband wanted my opinion. I said I would be there shortly. My mom let me leave my son there. When I got there I didn't pick up on anything until she opened the envelope that they came in from the picturel developer. We were looking through them and they were so good. Then before she got to the last, she paused and then told me that  in these pictures that something was on them that they couldn't figure out what it was. I was curious. She seemed a bit hesitant and then showed me the first of a series of 3 pictures. She had saved them for last.They had been taken one after the other. I was sitting on her couch holding her daughter and she pointed out that there was something strange to the left hand side of us. I looked at the picture and saw what I thought was  s slight white blur to the  right of us , a little about my shoulder. At first I thought her daughter or I had moved slightly as she was taking it or she moved as she was taking  it. She then showed me the next one. There was what looked like white transparent smoke  or mist and  it  was bigger than the first picture. I squinted at it and tried to think about what it could be. We didn't smoke. No candles burning. No mist vaporizer. I then watched her pick up the last picture.  My eyes widened when I saw it what blooked like something sitting on the couch beside us. It reminded  ectoplasim, from Ghost Busters. It was what looked like a  apparation was formingm  It was a milky white translucent figure. It had what looked to be a head with a skull like face. It looked like it was leaning in towards us, with a arm and what could have been a hand up to the side of the face like it was resting it's check against it's hand curled so the  knuckles  held up it's head,  with the  elbow sitting flat on a table (does this make sense?) sitting and  gazing at us.  A head with a shoulder, it's arm bent at the elbow, resting is chin on the balled hand. There was a little bit of what looked like it was it's upper torso. It looked like it have tried to form more but stopped at that point. It was facing us,  the   left side of its face to the camera, it's profile slightly turned showing it's right eye.\n socket. \nI was stunned. Chills covered my body. My mind was trying to register this. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Her husband came into the kitchen greeting me and saw my expression. They both felt the same way. We tried to come up with a plausible and rational explanation but could not. Then I remembered how I  maffelt like I was being watched that night. I told them about it.  They were looking at me with looks of  wide eyed incredulous belief. It showed up on the negatives too.  I asked them if they ever felt that way. They both said they hadn't. Of course he wasn't here a lot since they moved in. This was her family home. She felt safe and comfortable here. It had not felt sinister. And it didn't last very long.  It wasn't a black mass or figure. It was white.  I later found out she showed her older brothers her copies of the photos. They had the same reaction.  She asked them if  ever felt anything watching them or had any weird experience.  Her brother the middle child said that there was a ghost in the house and he saw it when he was a kid. I forget what else she found out, if he elaborated more about it. If it had been evil or negative, I am not sure he would tell her as not to freak her out more than she was. I think if it had been it would show it's presence especially now that they were bastrapaware there might be something paranormal and discussed it. She was very surprised by this   She had never experienced anything nor had  the oldest brother. Of course she was a bit unnerved by this. \nI never had that happen before or since. I have had strange ahexperiences off andon3since I was 3.DEYourexperience made me think of ours almost 27 years ago.  I hope you don't mind my long explanation. I can find but only  2 out of the threepictures. I don't know what happened to the third one where it was the most fully formed.  I have to figure out how to upload them to Reddit. I don't think I can on here. I will try to pin them on my homepage. I will have to take a picture of the photos with my phone then figure out the rest.  \n\nHave a Happy New Year. Dawn",

We were in middle school and it was the summer of ‚Äò85.\nI remember she and I were bored and really hot hanging out indoors so we decided to go for a walk around our city. We walked by all familiar spots like the grocery store, church and even the car wash. We were talking each others ears off, we didn‚Äôt realize how far we walked. We ended up by an elementary school that was on the other side of town and we noticed a small carnival had popped up on the corner of the soccer field. It was really weird to us right off the bat because of where it was and the fact that no one was there except for the workers. \nWe were curious and like I mentioned super bored so we decided to go in and check it out. Right away we noticed how dirty the workers were like as if they hadn‚Äôt showered in weeks. They all had this desperate look in their eye as if they were looking for trouble. The equipment seemed old and rusted too.\n\nWe had just enough dough between us to pay for a ride on the Farris wheel style ride. When we got on the ride, the operator slammed the bar so hard I remember as if he was trying to trap us.\nHe started the ride and little by little he cranked it up so it ended up spinning around really fast then he stopped the ride when we were on top. Him and his creepy buddy were getting a kick out of seeing us scream and pled to let us down. We were terrified because no one came to help us and these guys started saying really explicit things to us. \nHe finally stopped the ride let us off and we left so fast, we practically ran home. We told my friends older sister about what happened and she told us to forget about it. \nWe were driving by that school with her sister the very next day to show her where this encounter happened and it was gone with out a trace, the entire carnival. No trash of any kind not even indentation in the grass from the carnival equipment. She and I joke about this today and sometimes wonder if it was a hallucination of some kind..couldn‚Äôt explain it but it scared us!!! Sorry this is so long. Anyone else experience something like this??",

        "text": "Just today, my friend and I were hiking on some abandoned and unused land. It‚Äôs really beautiful, with lakes, cliffs, and tons of trees. The hike was going really well, but close to dark, it turned around. My friend whispered to me that they had been thinking of skinwalkers and couldn‚Äôt stop. This got me thinking of the same, and we decided to head back to the car to eliminate any risk. A few minutes into the hike back we both got horrible feelings and it became apparent that we were not alone. We kept making our way back to the car as fast as we could but it kept getting worse. Both of us experienced blurred vision, and the air suddenly got thick and had a hum to it. It also became incredibly hard to move and we both experienced an intense urge to lay down and stop hiking. The trek back to the car seemed to take five minutes and three hours simultaneously, so we have no clue how long it took. Neither of us has felt thins sense of dread or been this disoriented before. Do you think we had a close encounter with a skinwalker, or was it something else entirely? I do not have the background knowledge to say what exactly it could be. We are in eastern Kansas if that helps. Any information or ideas are appreciated!",

        "text": "(Deer is in quotes because I'm pretty much just assuming/hoping that it was a deer.)\n\n(Also, apologies if this is a little all over the place‚Äîthis just happened and I'm still very shaken.)\n\nSome background to start: I live in Virginia in a pretty rural area. My house is a townhome in a neighborhood right next to a middle school. I've lived in this house for over ten years and frequently went on walks during the daytime all around the neighborhood itself plus the surrounding buildings and woods, but I've never gone on a walk at night here. After starting college, I got very accustomed to taking walks around my campus at night when the weather's nice, so now that I'm home for winter break and Virginia is in one of its weirdly warm winter weeks, I decided I may as well go on a walk at night here, since it's a safe area and night walks are almost daily routines for me now.\n\nSo, I leave my house at around midnight, not very late. I walk over to the middle school and I sit down on the track (the track is a concrete oval going around the soccer field). I'm just sitting there, relaxing, listening to music with one earbud in. I also had a lit candle on the ground a foot in front of me, which sounds kind of weird of me to have, now that I type it out. Lighting candles while I sit and chill somewhere outside is just a habit I developed from having a ton of candles and being unable to light them in my room at college.\n\nI hear what sounded like a cough, so I instantly stop my music and start looking around. I don't see anything, but I'm an extremely paranoid person, so I'm still very on edge, even though everything seems fine. I just sit there doing nothing for maybe one or two minutes, and I start settling back down, thinking maybe the \"cough\" was just leaves in the nearby woods between my neighborhood and this soccer field.\n\nSo I'm almost fully relaxed, but then I head the \"cough\" again. Then I see something sprint on its back legs across the field faster than I've ever seen anything move before, and it gets to the other end of the field and then continues to stand there on its hind legs. I couldn't see it super well because it was dark and far away. Since I had just heard coughing and it was running on two legs, I initially thought it was a person, but when it was standing still, I could see that it was too large and weirdly proportioned to be human. It was also screeching the whole time. Like, an incredibly loud horror-movie-creature screeching that made my ears ring. \n\nIt looked like its back was to me, so I took the opportunity to pack up and sprint home. I'm physically disabled and I can move around just fine but never very quickly. I literally cannot think of another time in my life where I ever ran that fast.\n\nThe only sort of paranormal thing I believe in is plain old ghosts, so as soon as I got home, I texted all my friends about it and googled all I could. Everyone I texted reassured me it was probably just injured or diseased, since that can make deer act weird like that. So that's a little reassuring, but at the same time, I'm googling about deer running on their hind legs and screeching their heads off, and while it's a decently documented occurrence, none of the pictures and videos on any website are anywhere near what I saw. (In fact, the only accounts of experiences just like mine are other r/paranormal posts, or other subreddits/forums along those lines.)\n\nTwo additional details: 1) I am just assuming it was a deer based on its size. It didn't have antlers or anything. I couldn't really tell what it was, and I'm mainly going with deer because I'm very skeptical about paranormal topics and I don't want to assume it was anything other than a deer. 2) I've read descriptions of deer running on their hind legs and I've watched videos of it. None of the videos I've seen really match up with just how strangely fast this thing was moving. Like, it was basically a blur running past me.\n\nJust wanted to get this out there. Maybe someone who knows Appalachian animals better than I do can reassure me that it was just a sick deer or something. Happy new year.",
