It certainly has the look of palatalization, but the change of \\[voice\\] is what strikes me as odd.\n\nBarring documentation of any regular type of sound change, isolated examples would be appreciated.",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

This way the sentence \"XYZ isn't a language\" would just be wrong anyway and dialects are just individual languages in social/regional/ethnical groups that derive/ share with some other language. However, this doesn't solve the problem of when to consider something a dialect. Is Swiss-German a dialect of german? If so, is Dutch a dialect of german? If so, how much of the Germanic family can we consider germanic dialects?\n\nMaybe this entire thing is just a variation of Sorites Paradox and there isn't a valuable distinction between \"member of a language family\" and \"dialect of a language\".\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because this topic seems so relevant, yet not discussed enough and even if I find some nice notions on the internet that doesn't help anybody unless these notions are shared, not to mention my probable lack of understanding.",

        "text": "Author: James Konrad Puchowski - University of Edinburgh/Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann\n\nAbstract\n\nThrough top-down language planning and bottom-up advocacy, the Catalan language has often been presented as a language of societal cohesion in today's multiethnic and multilingual Catalonia. This article makes informed observations of an ad hoc Catalan language activist collective-No em canviïs la llengua. No em canviïs la llengua points to experiences of \"native-born\" Catalan interlocutors \"changing language\" to Castilian with them, and in 2019 created an informal group to express ideological opposition to alleged linguistic discrimination. I interpret No em canviïs la llengua as a novel example of language activism which follows from the historical trajectory of Catalan language policy and the work of other more formally established language organisations in Catalonia. Through their casually organised platform of events and social media interactions, these activists employ familiar rhetoric to construct an ideological narrative about the Catalan language: a \"language that unites us\". I use highlights from semi-structured interviews and a brief observational study of a No em canviïs la llengua event in February 2020 to showcase how these activists utilise extant narratives about the Catalan language as a \"tool of social cohesion\". I use a metapragmatic analysis to highlight themes of social equality, Catalan speaker identity, and linguistic agency. My analysis supports a non-essentialist approach to framing language activism, expanding beyond explicit demonstrations of activism, formal organisations, or native in-group/indigenous identities. As examples of social action, participation in sociolinguistic debate and interventions in metadiscourse also represent activism as a form of linguistic citizenship.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/356970550_No_em_canviis_la_llengua_Non-Native_Catalan_Speakers_and_the_Construction_of_an_Informal_Language_Activist_Platform",

        "text": "A long time ago I read an article about the \"punk rock accent\". It argued there's a way punk rock singers from southern California sing that is similar amongst them, but different from everyone else. Tom Delonge from Blink-182 has pretty much the strongest version; the lead singer of Newfound Glory is a strong runner up. \n\nWhat I'm interested in, however, is the TikTok accent. I think there's a separate accent of English spoken exclusively on TikTok, exemplified by two accounts: doobidoobap and Texas Beeworks. These have to be affectations, they sound fucking exactly the same to me. In this same category of non-nation-based accents, there's also the valorant accent and the vtuber accent (nyanners, veibae, and a third one I can't remember right now sound exactly the same)\n\nI suppose it's similar to the \"gay\" accent as a style of speaking in how it develops. But where does it come from? Why is there a tiktok accent? It's an interesting question to me, but I'm a philosopher, not a linguist.",

        "author": "zefciu",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/zqvzy7/distinguishing_affricates_from_consonant_clusters/",
        "text": "I was inspired to perform this experiment by some discussions on r/linguistics and some jokes on r/linguistichumor about the alleged lack of distinction between affricates and stop-fricative consonant clusters. These discussions often included the following exchange of arguments:\nA: Languages don’t typically contrast affricates with stop-fricative clusters. Therefore there is no phonemic distinction between them.\nB: Polish language does distinguish t͡ʂ and tʂ. It spells the former as ”cz” and the latter as “trz”. It even has a minimal pair of “czy” — an interrogatory particle and ”trzy” — the numeral “3”, which is distinguished in speech.\nA: Yes, but the difference between these two doesn’t boil down to cluster/affricate difference, as in “cz” the whole consonant is spoken with retroflex, while in “trz” the stop doesn’t have a retroflex. Therefore the phonemic distinction is really between [ʈʂ] and [tʂ]\n\n## Experiment\n\nTo determine what is the real phonemic difference here I decided to use a recorded pronounciation that would mix the phonemic traits of /ʈ͡ʂ/ and /tʂ/. I have created a recording where I pronounced /ʈʂɨ/ (i.e. a cluster of retroflex stop and retroflex fricative without blending them into affricate) three times. I posted the recording on r/polska and created a poll that asked to identify the word as either ”czy” or ”trzy”. https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/zl23er/co_s%C5%82yszysz_eksperyment/\n\n## Results\n\nThe poll gave a clear preference for ”trzy” (253 votes over 71 for “czy”). Some interesting comments:\n\nu/HandfulOfAcorns and u/lukasz5675 claimed that he would like an “other” option, as none of these words fits (4 upvotes)\n\nu/MayaErveluce u/Shierre and u/Unvilablent said they hear “tszy” (the first gaining 16 upvotes) which is curious, as there should be no phonemic distinction between the ”trzy” and ”tszy” spelling (due to devoicing).\n\nu/oklask666 u/gajowy and u/Ecstatic_Swordfish83 identified the recording as ”czszy”, — a cluster of an affricate and fricative.\n\nSome other users identified completely different stops with /k/ heard by u/Amangija gaining 14 upvotes\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo conclude — Polish speakers use both the place of articulation and the affricate/cluster contrast to distinguish between the ”czy — trzy” minimal pair. The affricate/cluster contrast seems to be dominant, however in case of mixing these two properties, the resulting word seems alien to many Polish speakers and is often hard to rationalize in terms of Polish phonotactics.\n\nI would be happy to see any comments to this. I’m. calling r/mistrzciastek and r/Tedenami that directly expressed interest in the subject.",
