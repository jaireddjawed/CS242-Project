The first-one is that it started from a really dense and small point that contained all of the universe’s mass. The second-one is that it is expanding faster than the speed of light.\nTheory says that, when a black hole is formed, all of its mass is condensed into a really dense and small point in the universe (sounds familiar?). The other thing it says is that the gravitational pull is bigger that the speed of light, so using Einstein’s relativity we know that, inside and the black hole, there is space generating at a rate faster than light.\nWhat I think happens is that, when a black hole is created, if we take time 0 (looking from inside the black hole) we would see a this really dense point with space tending to 0. Then, the instant after that, we would see a supernova/Big Bang like explosión, with space generating faster than light, therefore not letting matter come out of the singularity, setting the beginning of a new universe.\nNow talking about dark energy I’ll do a fast summary about what it is. Basically the concept of it was created because there is an omniscient energy that is contrary to the gravity maintaining the universe from going back into a point so, using my proposal we can solve the dark energy’s problem really fast. Physicists have stated that a black hole can spin at up to 84% of the speed of light so, if we think about the centrifugal force that such a rotation would have if applied in a universal scale, then that would explain that omniscient anti-gravity energy.\nthanks for reading everyone! please let me know what you think about it. I’d be glad to read your thoughts about why you think it’s wrong, what you can add to it or anything at all;) if you want I can post some thoughts I’ve come up with starting from this proposal.",

Now it's accelerating off into the wild blue yonder to ultimately die a heat death &amp; then there's nothing again.\nI'm not comfortable with this so could it all be the other way around?\nWhat if the universe is not expanding but contracting. We might be just millimeters from a zero point (singularity) &amp; accelerating towards it. But don't worry, we will never get there. Just get closer &amp; closer for ever &amp; ever &amp; ever. Always has been &amp; always will be.\nBut you say, what about all the stuff at the observable edge of the universe that is accelerating away from us at nearly light speed giving us red shift &amp; such. \nIsn't that just what we would see though? As we accelerate in, all the stuff far away also accelerates in, but as it's further away it's observed to be coming in slower. So to us it appears to be moving away. Just what we see. In fact it could be us going in at nearly light speed.\nIf we could send Mr Trump to the visible edge of the universe &amp; ask him what he sees, I'm sure his Twitter feed would be full of descriptions of a night sky just like ours. If he looked back towards home he would see us hauling arse away from him at nearly light speed.\nSo I ask what conclusive proof is there that this could not be so?",

And what is the universe cycle?\n•The universe expands increasingly quickly, as a result of the elementary particles in dark energy colliding in pairs eg quark pairs (similarly to the collisions inside a particle accelerator), which releases large amounts of energy in an exothermic reaction. This energy exerts a strong force that pushes on the boundary of the universe, causing it to expand. The reason why the expansion rate of the universe is increasing is because the reactions that are taking place also produce heat energy - and heat causes relations to happen faster as the elementary particles have more energy. This causes more reactions to take place, resulting in more heat, resulting in even more reactions, and this cycle continues. As this is happening, the universe is expanding, and as spacetime is an extremely flexible and elastic, this causes spacetime to stretch. Like all elastic materials, there is a point where it has been stretched too far - inelastic deformation. It could take trillions of years for this to happen to the universe because of its scale; but when it does, the spacetime will collapse in on its self at approximately 99.9999% of the speed of light (the fastest any object with mass can travel), collecting everything and dragging it towards its centre. When it reaches the centre of the universe, everything is smashed into such a small space that one of two possibilities will occur.\n\n•A gigamassive black hole will form, containing all the mass that ever existed in the known universe.\n\n•The collisions of every single atom in the universe would produce enough energy that the 'big bang' would happen again in the same way it did before - meaning that the universe is in a continuous loop of cycles.\n\nTheorised by Jamie Slater.\n\nApril 2018",

I’ve had this burning question for a while now; and I’d really appreciate feedback from someone who has studied this deeply.\n\nHere’s a burning physics question.\n\nIf the event horizon of a black hole is the point at which it’s gravity becomes too strong for light to escape; then would the proximity of 2 black holes cause each event horizon to decrease in radius (essentially pulling light/matter/energy out of its neighbor)?\n\nFollowing is a breakdown to explain my thought process:\nTo visualize it in 2 dimensions with a fabric/sheet to represent space-time, weighted spheres to represent celestial bodies, and (for fun) let's add a toy RC car to represent a propelled body (and the steering could be immobilized to represent light).\n\nThe gravitational pull is represented by the slope of the the fabric. Higher slope will have a stronger pull on other objects. Similarly, objects with greater volume (surface-area on our 2D plane) require a higher mass to become a black hole.  This would be represented by a certain steepness. At this steepness, our toy car would be unable to pull itself up the ramp of the fabric. It would slide backwards unless additional energy was added (continued thrust if representing a spacecraft) to maintain position, but it would no longer be capable of exiting. \n\nIf there were 2 heavy spherical weights to represent black holes, over time they would be pulled to each other.  Prior to heir collision, the slope of the fabric between the two weights will be lesser.  This essentially creates a 'step' that the toy car would be able to climb. Now, if the steering was immobilized, obviously a car pointing too near the center of the step would simply fall into the second pit.  However, an angled orientation could allow the car to escape both pits.\n\nI hope that I’ve flushed out any questions regarding how this analogy relates.  If so, would correctly angled light be able to escape a black hole’s event horizon when pulled by another? And would this cause the event horizon to decrease in size?\n",

His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\nHowever, he was perhaps most famous for *A Brief History of Time*, a popular science book which delves into the physics of black holes, time travel and more. He also was part of many documentaries, explaining higher physics to the masses.\n\nI don't think anyone could be prepared for his death.\n\nRIP, Stephen Hawking ~ 1942 - 2018",

        "text": "The question I’m asking here doesn’t relate to these two links, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07688\n\nhttp://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/habitable-planets-could-exist-around-pulsars\n\n, and… it definitely doesn’t relate to this link,\n\nhttps://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/34910/earth-like-planet-orbiting-neutron-star\n\nWhat I’m considering is the possibility of a more-or-less earthlike planet orbiting a nice sedate G or K class star that is itself a component in a multiple system containing a neutron star. The planet gets most of its heat from the long-lived star it orbits, though there may be effects from the neutron star that make it both interesting and perhaps marginal for human life. Interesting is good. Marginal is… acceptable for my purposes.\n\nMy needs for a planet are as follows:\n• It is fairly close in mass to Earth, not a super-Earth or small-Neptune or whatever\n• It can retain a decent atmosphere\n• It gets enough insolation from its G-class(-ish) parent to have a liveable temperature. But not too much\n• The ionizing radiation environment has been generally benign enough for long enough for it to have evolved and retained, if only in deep sea refugia, complex multicellular life\n• The radiation environment has been benign enough to evolve and retain enough photosynthetic organisms to develop a more or less human breathable atmosphere\n• Over the last billion years or so, the environment has been conducive to the evolution of some land plants and perhaps a few well-adapted land animals of some sort\n\nSome things I’d need to know to make this reasonably plausible(at least without snapping the disbelief suspenders too hard:\n• Assuming that the G-class star is a distant companion to the current neutron star(40-100 a.u.… farther?), and that the ns resulted from a supernova at least 4-5 billion years ago\n• Could a rocky planet of roughly earthlike size have survived a supernova if only as the remnant of a formerly much larger body?\n        •• If not, could a roughly Earth-sized planet have accreted around the companion from the debris of the supernova and any former planets it might have had?\n• How far out would the planet have to be from the neutron star to have retained a decent atmosphere under the influence of radiation from the ns?\n• About what sort of x-ray insolation would be an upper limit to retain an earthlike atmosphere and ozone layer for ~billions of years?\n• I’m happy to assume frequent mass extinctions from the magnetically-accelerated plume of radiation from the younger neutron star’s magnetic poles, but how often would those precess enough to put the planet in harms way if it is currently well beyond that area of effect?\n• Are there any questions I’m missing that might be stoppers? What are they? And what are the answers?\n\nFinally, some assumptions I’ve made:\n• This is an old neutron star. I kind of assume it’s cooled well beyond the pulsar stage in any case, so if that’s plausible, then we’d only be dealing with it’s thermal radiation and any bursts due to infalling mass.\n• The planet’s surface is rather enriched with heavy metals(notably, radioactives like thorium, uranium and plutonium, but also useful things like lead and gold, but also stuff like arsenic, selenium, mercury, cadmium and a variety of nasty isotopes, but only those that could survive a few billion years. There may even be a few surviving Island of Stability elements that managed to hang about\n• The lifeforms, at least on land and in shallow water, are well adapted to somewhat frequent short bursts of hard radiation. Less frequent longer duration radiation may be more of a problem…\n• We’re talking adaptations like greater redundancy of genetic material, some sort of error detecting/correcting genetic code(either passing over broken segments to use redundant copies or maximizing the likelihood of rapid cell death for most incorrectable errors. Cancer is still a thing as are mutations, but for a given environment they’re much less frequent. Other adaptations might be to isolate elements like lead into thick cell walls, or for multicellular organisms, segregating those elements completely into a thick skin or bark or perhaps a parasol of dead, hornified material directed towards the neutron star. \n• Perhaps some organisms only expose themselves when the neutron star is below the horizon, and retreating into deeper water, underground or into a leaden shell when bombarded with lethal radiation. \n\nI know some of these questions are well outside of the wheelhouse of astrophysics, but it would be greatly helpful if the non-bio questions could at least be checked for plausibility.

        "text": "There is a wide spectrum of stars, and a wide spectrum of how  a star can die. I'm wondering if it's possible to have a planet orbiting a decaying star that is letting off waves of energy and particles, at regular or semi-regular intervals? Would a planet be able to stay in orbit under such conditions? What would this planet look like?\n\nLet's say its a rocky planet and that the star is the size of our sun or larger. When our sun dies, it will start burning helium, get heavy and  bloated, then it will shrink down again, letting off its atmosphere in waves until it is diminished to a white dwarf. So far so good?\n\nWhat happens in the shrinking phase? Are the waves of energy and atmosphere so strong that they can push a planet out of orbit? Say the planet is tidally locked, is one side of a planet's surface roasted, while the other freezes? What happens to the planet's atmosphere? Has it already been cooked off during the helium phase, or is it shredded by the constant high-energy bombardment during the shrinking phase?\n\nI'm wondering if such a scenario could exist in the universe for a short story. It could be a good hideout for pirates or, say rebels?! (there are so many incredible astronomical phenomena beside binary systems that star wars simply fails to even consider). Basically, I'm trying to think of a planet that, because of the behavior of its star, would be a place that ships could only get to in between waves of energy, and generally a place that no one would legitimately consider going. A place the rebels could hide from the imperial (I'm sorry, first order) fleet. A system, the conditions of which the rebels could use to wreck enemy ships in the tradition of Sir Francis Drake v. the Spanish Armada. Thanks!",

Thank you for your time.\n\nWhat follows are a few proofs the earth is round and his rebuttals:\n\n1. The shadow on the moon during an eclipse is curved so must therfore the earth must be curved.\n\nA selenelion eclipse occurs when both the sun and moon are visible above the horizon. This means that the syzygy, 3 ball alignment, that is needed for an eclipse is not happening. \n\n2. ships disappear hull first over the horizon.\n\nShips go beyond the vanishing point of your perspective. U can watch a ship disappear and pull out a zoom lens and bring that ship back hull and all. Heavier molecules are nearer the surface due to the laws of density and buoyancy and cause more obscuring making the hull disappear first. Move up a few feet and the boat will reappear with the horizon moving farther away but not dropping in level. no curve there. The natural physics of water is to flow towards the area of least resistance until contained. Upon containment water will find and maintain a level surface no matter the shape of its container. All bodies of water from a glass, bathtub, lake, or ocean behave this way.\n\n3. U can see different constellations in the southern hemisphere than the northern hemisphere.\n\nDespite what we have been told about light traveling trillions of miles to hit ur eye, light does not travel forever. Man cannot see the entire sky above him. If the earth was traveling the speeds and distances science suggests parallax would be noticeable. The closer we would get to the stars the further away they would appear to each other and the farther away we went the closer they would appear. Yet millenia after millenia the stars maintain their same orientations and distances from each other. They tell us these stars are big suns, but through a telescope they look nothing like suns. They are each highly unique, pulsing, twinkling, changing colors and shapes. They are electic in nature, not burning balls of gas.\n\n4. Eratosthenes placed two sticks 500 miles away and noticed the shadows cast by the sticks were at different angles proving the earth is curved.\n\nWell first of all, did eratosthenes have internet, pony express, teleportation abilities. A ridiculous claim if ive ever heard one. The fact is a sun much closer and smaller than they claim would create the same affect of different angled shadows as well. No proof there.\n\n5. The higher u go the further u can see proving u are seeing around the ball. \n\nU can see further from higher due to perspective and the atmosphere being less dense the higher you are. By moving up your angle of resolution becomes greater and objects farther away can now fit within that angular limit. Also all the mist, dew, fog, smog, smoke, and other heavy particulates are no longer obscuring your view. No proof there.\n\n6. You can see the curvature from a plane.\n\nWhere is the photographic evidence of this? Some people claim to have seen the curve from a plane but they are looking through a convex window that bends light. The truth is it does not matter how high one goes the horizon will always be flat. It rises with you if not all the way to eye height when you get really high proving you are not on a ball. If the earth were a ball the horizon would have to dip below the original horizon the higher u went and one should not be able to look straight out and see the horizon. But u can. The only way that is possible is if the earth is a plane. An air plane flies in the air over a plane. no allowances for curvature are ever made. The horizon is horizontal. The only curvature you will ever see comes from space agency cgi and wide angle lenses that bend light near the edges. They even do this from the ground where noone thinks they can see curvature. No proof there.",

Recently I was reading a sci-if trilogy that would be interesting to any astrophysicist called The Three Body Problem, and it got me thinking about a number of things including the Fermi Paradox (which to sum for the uninitiated, is basically “where the hell are all the aliens!?). \n\nI forget the name for the style of reasoning, but it’s statistically unlikely that we are the first life in the universe if the conditions that brought about life aren’t a complete freak accident, and this is true whether or not god exists (if I might throw a bone to what I assume are the minority in this thread). This follows naturally from what stats is - a compilation of related data points - so that if there is or ever will be extraterrestrial life in the universe, it is severely unlikely to think that we are the first civilization, or even that we’re so close to the front of the wave our corner of the universe simply hasn’t populated yet.\n\nWe can see some 13 billion light years away from us, thereby determining the composition of stars through light spectroscopy, and theoretically, so can anybody else in the universe with adequate resources, to at least a degree equaling ours. As our computing ability grows with the advent of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, with breakthroughs in our understanding of anti-matter, dark-matter, and gravity, it is impossible to say currently with any conclusive evidence what the limit of terrestrial sight into the universe is. Therefore, we don’t know what the limits of any possible extraterrestrial civilization are either.\n\nMy question has a few facets because i’m not familiar with the astrophysics, but if we can determine temperature of a celestial body based on light spectroscopy, would another civilization be able to detect our rapidly rising cumulative temperature?\n\n\nThe implications of a yes answer to that question might eventually become quite concerning.\n",
