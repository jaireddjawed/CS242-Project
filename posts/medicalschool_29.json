We have over 900 possible combos including no match combos. We‚Äôre going to use all 300 ranks. Obviously we‚Äôll put same city and short distance combos first, but I‚Äôm wondering if for longer distances there should be an element of strategy over preference? I know for single applicants you should always rank based on preference but we technically are not going to be able to rank every possible match combination so should we rank ones we perceive as better odds higher? I‚Äôm concerned that our odds at matching at our ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù distance program combos are not great because they‚Äôre reach programs, so maybe we should include more realistic combos that we‚Äôd have a better shot at matching before we fall to the ‚Äúno match‚Äù combos. Our priority is to be matched even if we end up apart, but draw the line at direct flight &lt;3 hrs. Any match experts with advice?",

Some students have managed to get out of it by emailing, others have not, so it's inconsistent and there is no written policy\n\n5) There's also no structured support or debriefing opportunities for students that are required to do this encounter &amp; as a result are made to relive memories of some of the worst moments of their life\n\nI know these conversations are very important because we will be having them with patients in the future. However, at the same time, there's something very different between having a conversation with an actual patient in a clinical setting and role-playing the scenario with an actor while being watched through a two-way mirror by an evaluator. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Even if it was something like a melanoma excision, we'd get a P.A. for every procedure we did that wasn't cosmetic. Every insurance company has coverage policies that indicate which ICD-10 codes are required to cover which CPT codes, and almost all of our denied P.A.s could get approved on appeal (even if the surgery was already completed because it was an urgent/emergent case) by submitting a letter of medical necessity citing the codes and *their* policy numbers. I actually made word document forms with drop-down and fill-in-the-blank fields for our most common procedures and diagnoses for our most common problem insurance companies. \n\nYou can fight for your patients, and you can find good support staff who will help you do that. Also, know that, as a physician, you pretty much always have the right to demand a physician-to-physician review of any denied claims or prior authorizations. I know it's not what you're going to medical school for, but you have to be prepared to fight for your patients' basic human right of access to healthcare.",

I'm an M4 graduating from a US MD school. They state that if you have a parent that is an MD, they can hood you at graduation and to just reply in an email to them letting them know your parent's name. In my reply I put my fathers name, with his title DO at the end. He's pretty excited to do this as am I, he was a major influence on me and my choice to pursue medicine.\n\nI get a reply yesterday, after like 10 days or so, reading along the lines of \"fuck you, we only allow MDs to hood graduates at the hooding ceremony, suck our dicks\". I specified that my dad is a physician, pointing out the fucking DO degree he went to med school for 4 years to get, and they basically had a copy/pasted reply with the same bullshit \"Sorry asshole this is the MDs only club\".\n\nI had to tell my dad last night and he is pretty sad about this. I really cannot wrap my head around this. I understand theres some historical stigma against DOs that has stuck around because of dickfaced morons but this is genuine pettiness to a degree that I really thought grown professionals would be above. Is this normal behavior to actively only allow one type of physician to hood MD grads?? If it is it's a standard that can fuck off.\n\nSuck my dick and choke on it",

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nAs you all know, in medical school we get overwhelmed with the ton of diseases and stuff we have to learn in very short time, and if we do not review them very often, we can forget much of the diseases. So, abiding by the principle of \"work smart not hard\" I am exploring the possibility of building a personal tool that uses an algorithm I build in order to reach diagnosis based on the information I provide (basically the information that I learn in and outside my med school). Any tips on how I can do so? A good model would be the app \"Ada\" ([https://ada.com/app/](https://ada.com/app/)) but I want something exclusive and personal to me.\n\nWhy I wanna do this? because there are diseases that are so rare we only come across them almost never, so if I actually come across it in clinical situation, I would fear that by then I would've forgotten the diagnostic algorithm for that disease. Also, there are diseases that are so similar but their treatments and prognosis are so different thus they must be discriminated very very carefully.\n\nWould love to listen to your thoughts.",
